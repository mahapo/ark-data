Her first novel, We the Living, was published in 1936,followed by Anthem. With the publication of The Fountainhead in 1943, sheachieved a spectacular and enduring success. Rand’s unique philosophy,Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophyare set forth in such books as Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, TheVirtue of Selfishness, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, and The RomanticManifesto. Ayn Rand died in 1982. LEONARD PEIKOFF is universally recognized as the preeminent Rand scholar writingtoday. He worked closely with her for thirty years and was designated by Rand asher intellectual heir and as heir to her estate. He has taught philosophy atHunter College, Long Island University, and New York University, and lectures onRand’s philosophy throughout the country. Peikoff is the author of Objectivism:The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, and hosts the national radio talk show “Philosophy:Who Needs It?” GARY HULL, who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from Claremont, has taught philosophyat California State University, Fullerton, Whittier College, and is currently anadjunct professor at Duke University.

Her best-known and most philosophical novels, TheFountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, number respectively 727 and 1,168 pages (inhardcover). This abundance of material poses a problem for many time-pressedreaders. They do not know where to plunge in or how to select a representativesample. The present book is designed to meet these needs.The readers I have in mind probably read relatively little fiction orphilosophy. But they have noticed that AR is known virtually everywhere—and thateveryone seems to have an impassioned opinion about her. They have heard herbooks being extolled and denounced with equal intensity—often in quiteunexpected quarters. Naturally enough, they are intrigued by the controversy.Here is a chance for such individuals to explore her works briefly and reach ajudgment of their own.Although I hope it will be of value to previous readers of AR, this anthology isintended as an entrée for those who know little or nothing about her. Each ofher four novels and every branch of philosophy are represented within its pages,even if only in brief excerpts. Whoever finishes the book, therefore, can say inall conscience that he knows the essence of AR—and that he knows it by means ofactually having read her.AR’s philosophic ideas permeate each of her novels. In broad tendency, however,her early novels are devoted to social-political issues; The Fountainhead toethical issues; and Atlas Shrugged, her magnum opus, to the fundamental branchesof philosophy. This progression is the key to the present book’s organization(see the Editor’s Preface below).Although the material has been organized in a definite structure, browsers whowish merely to dip in at random can profit from doing so. Those who wish toexplore further will find that the selections are not only representative; theyhave been picked deliberately from a wide range of primary sources, and therebysuggest a fairly complete range of options for future reading.As a mini-orientation for new readers, let me offer here a thumb-nail sketch ofAR’s Objectivist philosophy.Metaphysics: The universe exists objectively, independent of consciousness. Itsfundamental law is the law of identity, A is A.Epistemology: Reason is man’s only means of knowledge, both of facts and ofvalues. “Reason” is the faculty of identifying and integrating, in conceptualform, the material provided by man’s senses.Ethics: The only scientific ethics is the ethics of rational self-interest,which holds that Man’s Life is the standard of moral value and that rationalityis the primary virtue. Each man, therefore, should live by his own mind and forhis own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor others to himself.Politics: The only social system consistent with the requirements of Man’s Lifeis laissez-faire capitalism, the complete separation of state and economics. Theproper function of government is to protect each individual’s inalienable rightsto life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.Esthetics: “Art” is the re-creation of reality according to an artist’smetaphysical value-judgments-and the greatest school in art history isRomanticism, whose art presents things not as they are, but as they might be andought to be.To put the above in negative terms, AR rejects, among many other kindred isms,every form of supernaturalism, subjectivism, mysticism, skepticism, altruism,relativism, collectivism, statism, and (in art) both Naturalism and “modernism.”As you may be starting to see, AR cannot be identified by using the conventionalcategories. She is neither a liberal nor a conservative. She admires Aristotle,but denies that “moderation” is the definition of virtue. She regardsLibertarians as worse than Communists. She is a moralist who rejects religion,an individualist who dismisses Spencer, an egoist who denounces Nietzsche—and aphilosopher who writes thrillers. How is all this possible? Read on and find outfor yourself.The Ayn Rand Reader represents the work of two editors. Gary Hull, a longtimeteacher of Objectivism, had the painful job of making the preliminaryselections; he also devised the book’s structure and wrote the first draft ofmost of the editorial notes. As Executor of the Estate of AR, I myself thenimplemented a layer of suggestions, along with many editorial revisions.Arnold Dolin, Associate Publisher of Dutton/Signet, had been urging me for yearsto prepare this kind of book. Unfortunately, the demands of other commitmentsalways made it impossible. It is thanks to the labor of Dr. Hull that thisanthology has finally become a reality. His work (which includes all theproofreading) was really the time-consuming part of the project.I hope that The Ayn Rand Reader serves its purpose, and introduces AR to manyreaders who would otherwise be denied the pleasure and knowledge she has tooffer.Leonard PeikoffIrvine, CaliforniaJanuary 1998"},{"pageContent":"EDITOR’S PREFACEby Gary Hull TO INTRODUCE new readers to the novels and philosophy of Ayn Rand, thisanthology presents alternating fiction and nonfiction sections. Excerpts from anovel are followed by nonfiction passages elaborating on its theme.I have chosen relatively self-contained excerpts from AR’s four novels: TheFountainhead (in Part One), Atlas Shrugged (Part Three), We the Living, andAnthem (Part Five). These selections at least suggest the novels’ themes, plots,and literary style, along with some leading characters.Although The Fountainhead was published in 1943, seven years after We theLiving, I have placed it at the beginning because the hero—Howard Roark—is thebest known of AR’s characters, and is her first fully developed depiction of themoral ideal. This led naturally to a nonfiction section on AR’s ethics (PartTwo), including her explanation of why man needs morality, her defense ofselfishness, and her view of man’s nature.Next comes Atlas Shrugged, followed by a section on basic philosophy (PartFour). This section covers such issues as the axioms of Objectivism and themind-body question, along with some more technical material on AR’s view ofconcepts.This left me with AR’s early, directly political novels—followed by a section onher social-political convictions (Part Five). I have concluded with a sectionpresenting both her theory of art—and, as a final overview, herbenevolent-universe viewpoint (Part Six).Given AR’s voluminous writings, I have had to be extremely selective. Forinstance, if I had more space, I would have included all of John Galt’s speechin Atlas Shrugged—the briefest statement of her philosophy available. Otheromissions include selections from her plays, early short stories, journals, andletters, as well as her views on education, psychology, economics and law, musicand history, and on many vital current social issues. I hope that thebibliography of AR’s complete works will serve as a resource for furtherreading.The editor’s notes provide, where necessary, minimal background information toorient a new reader. In a number of cases, a passage was deleted from an excerptbecause, out of context, it would have confused or distracted a reader. Suchdeletions are indicated by ellipses in square brackets. Occasional explanatorywords have been inserted in brackets. I have, of course, made no changes in AR’sown words.For twelve years of intellectual, financial, and emotional support I extend mysincerest appreciation to the Ayn Rand Institute. Lara Piper worked diligentlyto prepare the manuscript for the printer. Most of all, I want to thank LeonardPeikoff for the wonderful opportunity to work on this project, and for theinsightful guidance he offered me throughout."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEThe FountainheadEDITOR’S NOTE: The theme of The Fountainhead (published in 1943) isindividualism versus collectivism, not in politics but in man’s soul. In thisexcerpt, the first three chapters of the novel, we meet Ayn Rand’s ideal man:the intransigent individualist Howard Roark. We also meet his antithesis, theman without a self, Peter Keating. This introduces the novel’s basic conflict:independence versus dependence."},{"pageContent":"Roark vs. Keating HOWARD ROARK laughed.He stood naked at the edge of a cliff. The lake lay far below him. A frozenexplosion of granite burst in flight to the sky over motionless water. The waterseemed immovable, the stone—flowing. The stone had the stillness of one briefmoment in battle when thrust meets thrust and the currents are held in a pausemore dynamic than motion. The stone glowed, wet with sunrays.The lake below was only a thin steel ring that cut the rocks in half. The rockswent on into the depth, unchanged. They began and ended in the sky. So that theworld seemed suspended in space, an island floating on nothing, anchored to thefeet of the man on the cliff.His body leaned back against the sky. It was a body of long straight lines andangles, each curve broken into planes. He stood, rigid, his hands hanging at hissides, palms out. He felt his shoulder blades drawn tight together, the curve ofhis neck, and the weight of the blood in his hands. He felt the wind behind him,in the hollow of his spine. The wind waved his hair against the sky. His hairwas neither blond nor red, but the exact color of ripe orange rind.He laughed at the thing which had happened to him that morning and at the thingswhich now lay ahead.He knew that the days ahead would be difficult. There were questions to be facedand a plan of action to be prepared. He knew that he should think about it. Heknew also that he would not think, because everything was clear to him already,because the plan had been set long ago, and because he wanted to laugh.He tried to consider it. But he forgot. He was looking at the granite.He did not laugh as his eyes stopped in awareness of the earth around him. Hisface was like a law of nature—a thing one could not question, alter or implore.It had high cheekbones over gaunt, hollow cheeks; gray eyes, cold and steady; acontemptuous mouth shut tight, the mouth of an executioner or a saint.He looked at the granite. To be cut, he thought, and made into walls. He lookedat a tree. To be split and made into rafters. He looked at a streak of rust onthe stone and thought of iron ore under the ground. To be melted and to emergeas girders against the sky.These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the drill, the dynamiteand my voice; waiting to be split, ripped, pounded, reborn; waiting for theshape my hands will give them.Then he shook his head, because he remembered that morning and that there weremany things to be done. He stepped to the edge, raised his arms, and dived downinto the sky below.He cut straight across the lake to the shore ahead. He reached the rocks wherehe had left his clothes. He looked regretfully about him. For three years, eversince he had lived in Stanton, he had come here for his only relaxation, toswim, to rest, to think, to be alone and alive, whenever he could find one hourto spare, which had not been often. In his new freedom the first thing he wantedto do was to come here, because he knew that he was coming for the last time.That morning he had been expelled from the Architectural School of the StantonInstitute of Technology.He pulled his clothes on: old denim trousers, sandals, a shirt with shortsleeves and most of its buttons missing. He swung down a narrow trail among theboulders, to a path running through a green slope, to the road below.He walked swiftly, with a loose, lazy expertness of motion. He walked down thelong road, in the sun. Far ahead Stanton lay sprawled on the coast ofMassachusetts, a little town as a setting for the gem of its existence—the greatinstitute rising on a hill beyond.The township of Stanton began with a dump. A gray mound of refuse rose in thegrass. It smoked faintly. Tin cans glittered in the sun. The road led past thefirst houses to a church. The church was a Gothic monument of shingles paintedpigeon blue. It had stout wooden buttresses supporting nothing. It hadstained-glass windows with heavy traceries of imitation stone. It opened the wayinto long streets edged by tight, exhibitionist lawns. Behind the lawns stoodwooden piles tortured out of all shape: twisted into gables, turrets, dormers;bulging with porches; crushed under huge, sloping roofs. White curtains floatedat the windows. A garbage can stood at a side door, flowing over. An oldPekinese sat upon a cushion on a door step, its mouth drooling. A line ofdiapers fluttered in the wind between the columns of a porch.People turned to look at Howard Roark as he passed. Some remained staring afterhim with sudden resentment. They could give no reason for it: it was an instincthis presence awakened in most people. Howard Roark saw no one. For him, thestreets were empty. He could have walked there naked without concern.He crossed the heart of Stanton, a broad green edged by shop windows. Thewindows displayed new placards announcing: WELCOME TO THE CLASS OF ‘22! GOODLUCK, CLASS OF ’22! The Class of ’22 of the Stanton Institute of Technology washolding its commencement exercises that afternoon.Roark swung into a side street, where at the end of a long row, on a knoll overa green ravine, stood the house of Mrs. Keating. He had boarded at that housefor three years.Mrs. Keating was out on the porch. She was feeding a couple of canaries in acage suspended over the railing. Her pudgy little hand stopped in mid-air whenshe saw him. She watched him with curiosity. She tried to pull her mouth into aproper expression of sympathy; she succeeded only in betraying that the processwas an effort.He was crossing the porch without noticing her. She stopped him.“Mr. Roark!”“Yes?”“Mr. Roark, I’m so sorry about—” she hesitated demurely, “—about what happenedthis morning.”“What?” he asked.“Your being expelled from the Institute. I can’t tell you how sorry I am. I onlywant you to know that I feel for you.”He stood looking at her. She knew that he did not see her. No, she thought, itwas not that exactly. He always looked straight at people and his damnable eyesnever missed a thing, it was only that he made people feel as if they did notexist. He just stood looking. He would not answer.“But what I say,” she continued, “is that if one suffers in this world, it’s onaccount of error. Of course, you’ll have to give up the architect professionnow, won’t you? But then a young man can always earn a decent living clerking orselling or something.”He turned to go.“Oh, Mr. Roark!” she called.“Yes?”“The Dean phoned for you while you were out.”For once, she expected some emotion from him; and an emotion would be theequivalent of seeing him broken. She did not know what it was about him that hadalways made her want to see him broken.“Yes?” he asked.“The Dean,” she repeated uncertainly, trying to recapture her effect. “The Deanhimself through his secretary.”“Well?”“She said to tell you that the Dean wanted to see you immediately the moment yougot back.”“Thank you.”“What do you suppose he can want now?”“I don’t know.”He had said: “I don’t know.” She had heard distinctly: “I don’t give a damn.”She stared at him incredulously.“By the way,” she said, “Petey is graduating today.” She said it withoutapparent relevance.“Today? Oh, yes.”“It’s a great day for me. When I think of how I skimped and slaved to put my boythrough school. Not that I’m complaining. I’m not one to complain. Petey’s abrilliant boy.”She stood drawn up. Her stout little body was corseted so tightly under thestarched folds of her cotton dress that it seemed to squeeze the fat out to herwrists and ankles.“But of course,” she went on rapidly, with the eagerness of her favoritesubject, “I’m not one to boast. Some mothers are lucky and others just aren’t.We’re all in our rightful place. You just watch Petey from now on. I’m not oneto want my boy to kill himself with work and I’ll thank the Lord for any smallsuccess that comes his way. But if that boy isn’t the greatest architect of thisU.S.A., his mother will want to know the reason why!”He moved to go.“But what am I doing, gabbing with you like that!” she said brightly. “You’vegot to hurry and change and run along. The Dean’s waiting for you.”She stood looking after him through the screen door, watching his gaunt figuremove across the rigid neatness of her parlor. He always made her uncomfortablein the house, with a vague feeling of apprehension, as if she were waiting tosee him swing out suddenly and smash her coffee tables, her Chinese vases, herframed photographs. He had never shown any inclination to do so. She keptexpecting it, without knowing why.Roark went up the stairs to his room. It was a large, bare room, made luminousby the clean glow of whitewash. Mrs. Keating had never had the feeling thatRoark really lived there. He had not added a single object to the barenecessities of furniture which she had provided; no pictures, no pennants, nocheering human touch. He had brought nothing to the room but his clothes and hisdrawings; there were few clothes and too many drawings; they were stacked highin one corner; sometimes she thought that the drawings lived there, not the man.Roark walked now to these drawings; they were the first things to be packed. Helifted one of them, then the next, then another. He stood looking at the broadsheets.They were sketches of buildings such as had never stood on the face of theearth. They were as the first houses built by the first man born, who had neverheard of others building before him. There was nothing to be said of them,except that each structure was inevitably what it had to be. It was not as ifthe draftsman had sat over them, pondering laboriously, piecing together doors,windows and columns, as his whim dictated and as the books prescribed. It was asif the buildings had sprung from the earth and from some living force, complete,unalterably right. The hand that had made the sharp pencil lines still had muchto learn. But not a line seemed superfluous, not a needed plane was missing. Thestructures were austere and simple, until one looked at them and realized whatwork, what complexity of method, what tension of thought had achieved thesimplicity. No laws had dictated a single detail. The buildings were notClassical, they were not Gothic, they were not Renaissance. They were onlyHoward Roark.He stopped, looking at a sketch. It was one that had never satisfied him. He haddesigned it as an exercise he had given himself, apart from his schoolwork; hedid that often when he found some particular site and stopped before it to thinkof what building it should bear. He had spent nights staring at this sketch,wondering what he had missed. Glancing at it now, unprepared, he saw the mistakehe had made.He flung the sketch down on the table, he bent over it, he slashed linesstraight through his neat drawing. He stopped once in a while and stood lookingat it, his fingertips pressed to the paper; as if his hands held the building.His hands had long fingers, hard veins, prominent joints and wristbones.An hour later he heard a knock at his door.“Come in!” he snapped, without stopping.“Mr. Roark!” gasped Mrs. Keating, staring at him from the threshold. “What onearth are you doing?”He turned and looked at her, trying to remember who she was.“How about the Dean?” she moaned. “The Dean that’s waiting for you?”“Oh,” said Roark. “Oh, yes. I forgot.”“You ... forgot?”“Yes.” There was a note of wonder in his voice, astonished by her astonishment.“Well, all I can say,” she choked, “is that it serves you right! It just servesyou right. And with the commencement beginning at four-thirty, how do you expecthim to have time to see you?”“I’ll go at once, Mrs. Keating.” ,It was not her curiosity alone that prompted her to action; it was a secret fearthat the sentence of the Board might be revoked. He went to the bathroom at theend of the hall; she watched him washing his hands, throwing his loose, straighthair back into a semblance of order. He came out again, he was on his way to thestairs before she realized that he was leaving.“Mr. Roark!” she gasped, pointing at his clothes. “You’re not going like this?”“Why not?”“But it’s your Dean!”“Not any more, Mrs. Keating.”She thought, aghast, that he said it as if he were actually happy.The Stanton Institute of Technology stood on a hill, its crenelated walls raisedas a crown over the city stretched below. It looked like a medieval fortress,with a Gothic cathedral grafted to its belly. The fortress was eminently suitedto its purpose, with stout, brick walls, a few slits wide enough for sentries,ramparts behind which defending archers could hide, and corner turrets fromwhich boiling oil could be poured upon the attacker—should such an emergencyarise in an institute of learning. The cathedral rose over it in lace splendor,a fragile defense against two great enemies: light and air.The Dean’s office looked like a chapel, a pool of dreamy twilight fed by onetall window of stained glass. The twilight flowed in through the garments ofstiff saints, their arms contorted at the elbows. A red spot of light and apurple one rested respectively upon two genuine gargoyles squatting at thecorners of a fireplace that had never been used. A green spot stood in thecenter of a picture of the Parthenon, suspended over the fireplace.When Roark entered the office, the outlines of the Dean’s figure swam dimlybehind his desk, which was carved like a confessional. He was a short, plumpishgentleman whose spreading flesh was held in check by an indomitable dignity.“Ah, yes, Roark,” he smiled. “Do sit down, please.”Roark sat down. The Dean entwined his fingers on his stomach and waited for theplea he expected. No plea came. The Dean cleared his throat.“It will be unnecessary for me to express my regret at the unfortunate event ofthis morning,” he began, “since I take it for granted that you have always knownmy sincere interest in your welfare.”“Quite unnecessary,” said Roark.The Dean looked at him dubiously, but continued:“Needless to say, I did not vote against you. I abstained entirely. But you maybe glad to know that you had quite a determined little group of defenders at themeeting. Small, but determined. Your professor of structural engineering actedquite the crusader on your behalf. So did your professor of mathematics.Unfortunately, those who felt it their duty to vote for your expulsion quiteoutnumbered the others. Professor Peterkin, your critic of design, made an issueof the matter. He went so far as to threaten us with his resignation unless youwere expelled. You must realize that you have given Professor Peterkin greatprovocation.”“I do,” said Roark.“That, you see, was the trouble. I am speaking of your attitude towards thesubject of architectural design. You have never given it the attention itdeserves. And yet, you have been excellent in all the engineering sciences. Ofcourse, no one denies the importance of structural engineering to a futurearchitect, but why go to extremes? Why neglect what may be termed the artisticand inspirational side of your profession and concentrate on all those dry,technical, mathematical subjects? You intended to become an architect, not acivil engineer.”“Isn’t this superfluous?” Roark asked. “It’s past. There’s no point indiscussing my choice of subjects now.”“I am endeavoring to be helpful, Roark. You must be fair about this. You cannotsay that you were not given many warnings before this happened.”“I was.”The Dean moved in his chair. Roark made him uncomfortable. Roark’s eyes werefixed on him politely. The Dean thought, there’s nothing wrong with the way he’slooking at me, in fact it’s quite correct, most properly attentive; only, it’sas if I were not here.“Every problem you were given,” the Dean went on, “every project you had todesign—what did you do with it? Every one of them done in that—well, I cannotcall it a style—in that incredible manner of yours. It is contrary to everyprinciple we have tried to teach you, contrary to all established precedents andtraditions of Art. You may think you are what is called a modernist, but itisn’t even that. It is . . . it is sheer insanity, if you don’t mind.”“I don’t mind.”“When you were given projects that left the choice of style up to you and youturned in one of your wild stunts—well, frankly, your teachers passed youbecause they did not know what to make of it. But, when you were given anexercise in the historical styles, a Tudor chapel or a French opera house todesign—and you turned in something that looked like a lot of boxes piledtogether without rhyme or reason—would you say it was an answer to an assignmentor plain insubordination?”“It was insubordination,” said Roark.“We wanted to give you a chance—in view of your brilliant record in all othersubjects. But when you turn in this—” the Dean slammed his fist down on a sheetspread before him—“this as a Renaissance villa for your final project of theyear—really, my boy, it was too much!”The sheet bore a drawing—a house of glass and concrete. In the corner there wasa sharp, angular signature: Howard Roark.“How do you expect us to pass you after this?”“I don’t.”“You left us no choice in the matter. Naturally, you would feel bitternesstoward us at this moment, but . . .”“I feel nothing of the kind,” said Roark quietly “I owe you an apology. I don’tusually let things happen to me. I made a mistake this time. I shouldn’t havewaited for you to throw me out. I should have left long ago.”“Now, now, don’t get discouraged. This is not the right attitude to take.Particularly in view of what I am going to tell you.”The Dean smiled and leaned forward confidentially, enjoying the overture to agood deed.“Here is the real purpose of our interview. I was anxious to let you know assoon as possible. I did not wish to leave you disheartened. Oh, I did,personally, take a chance with the President’s temper when I mentioned this tohim, but . . . Mind you, he did not commit himself, but . . . Here is how thingsstand: now that you realize how serious it is, if you take a year off, to rest,to think it over—shall we say to grow up?—there might be a chance of our takingyou back. Mind you, I cannot promise anything—this is strictly unofficial—itwould be most unusual, but in view of the circumstances and of your brilliantrecord, there might be a very good chance.”Roark smiled. It was not a happy smile, it was not a grateful one. It was asimple, easy smile and it was amused.“I don’t think you understood me,” said Roark. “What made you suppose that Iwant to come back?”“Eh?”“I won’t be back. I have nothing further to learn here.”“I don’t understand you,” said the Dean stiffly.“Is there any point in explaining? It’s of no interest to you any longer.”“You will kindly explain yourself.”“If you wish. I want to be an architect, not an archeologist. I see no purposein doing Renaissance villas. Why learn to design them, when I’ll never buildthem?”“My dear boy, the great style of the Renaissance is far from dead. Houses ofthat style are being erected every day.”“They are. And they will be. But not by me.”“Come, come, now, this is childish.”“I came here to learn about building. When I was given a project, its only valueto me was to learn to solve it as I would solve a real one in the future. I didthem the way I’ll build them. I’ve learned all I could learn here—in thestructural sciences of which you don’t approve. One more year of drawing Italianpost cards would give me nothing.”An hour ago the Dean had wished that this interview would proceed as calmly aspossible. Now he wished that Roark would display some emotion; it seemedunnatural for him to be so quietly natural in the circumstances.“Do you mean to tell me that you’re thinking seriously of building that way,when and if you are an architect?”“Yes.”“My dear fellow, who will let you?”“That’s not the point. The point is, who will stop me?”“Look here, this is serious. I am sorry that I haven’t had a long, earnest talkwith you much earlier . . . I know, I know, I know, don’t interrupt me, you’veseen a modernistic building or two, and it gave you ideas. But do you realizewhat a passing fancy that whole so-called modern movement is? You must learn tounderstand—and it has been proved by all authorities—that everything beautifulin architecture has been done already. There is a treasure mine in every styleof the past. We can only choose from the great masters. Who are we to improveupon them? We can only attempt, respectfully, to repeat.”“Why?” asked Howard Roark.No, thought the Dean, no, he hasn’t said anything else; it’s a perfectlyinnocent word; he’s not threatening me.“But it’s self-evident!” said the Dean.“Look,” said Roark evenly, and pointed at the window. “Can you see the campusand the town? Do you see how many men are walking and living down there? Well, Idon’t give a damn what any or all of them think about architecture—or aboutanything else, for that matter. Why should I consider what their grandfathersthought of it?”“That is our sacred tradition.”“Why?”.“For heaven’s sake, can’t you stop being so naïve about it?”“But I don’t understand. Why do you want me to think that this is greatarchitecture?” He pointed to the picture of the Parthenon.“That,” said the Dean, “is the Parthenon.”“So it is.”“I haven’t the time to waste on silly questions.”“All right, then.” Roark got up, he took a long ruler from the desk, he walkedto the picture. “Shall I tell you what’s rotten about it?”“It’s the Parthenon!” said the Dean.“Yes, God damn it, the Parthenon!”The ruler struck the glass over the picture.“Look,” said Roark. “The famous flutings on the famous columns—what are theythere for? To hide the joints in wood—when columns were made of wood, only thesearen’t, they’re marble. The triglyphs, what are they? Wood. Wooden beams, theway they had to be laid when people began to build wooden shacks. Your Greekstook marble and they made copies of their wooden structures out of it, becauseothers had done it that way. Then your masters of the Renaissance came along andmade copies in plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood. Now here we are,making copies in steel and concrete of copies in plaster of copies in marble ofcopies in wood. Why?”The Dean sat watching him curiously. Something puzzled him, not in the words,but in Roark’s manner of saying them.“Rules?” said Roark. “Here are my rules: what can be done with one substancemust never be done with another. No two materials are alike. No two sites onearth are alike. No two buildings have the same purpose. The purpose, the site,the material determine the shape. Nothing can be reasonable or beautiful unlessit’s made by one central idea, and the idea sets every detail. A building isalive, like a man. Its integrity is to follow its own truth, its one singletheme, and to serve its own single purpose. A man doesn’t borrow pieces of hisbody. A building doesn’t borrow hunks of its soul. Its maker gives it the souland every wall, window and stairway to express it.”“But all the proper forms of expression have been discovered long ago.”“Expression—of what? The Parthenon did not serve the same purpose as its woodenancestor. An airline terminal does not serve the same purpose as the Parthenon.Every form has its own meaning. Every man creates his meaning and form and goal.Why is it so important—what others have done? Why does it become sacred by themere fact of not being your own? Why is anyone and everyone right—so long asit’s not yourself? Why does the number of those others take the place of truth?Why is truth made a mere matter of arithmetic—and only of addition at that? Whyis everything twisted out of all sense to fit everything else? There must besome reason. I don’t know. I’ve never known it. I’d like to understand.”“For heaven’s sake,” said the Dean. “Sit down.... That’s better.... Would youmind very much putting that ruler down? ... Thank you.... Now listen to me. Noone has ever denied the importance of modern technique to an architect. We mustlearn to adapt the beauty of the past to the needs of the present. The voice ofthe past is the voice of the people. Nothing has ever been invented by one manin architecture. The proper creative process is a slow, gradual, anonymous,collective one, in which each man collaborates with all the others andsubordinates himself to the standards of the majority.”“But you see,” said Roark quietly, “I have, let’s say, sixty years to live. Mostof that time will be spent working. I’ve chosen the work I want to do. If I findno joy in it, then I’m only condemning myself to sixty years of torture. And Ican find the joy only if I do my work in the best way possible to me. But thebest is a matter of standards—and I set my own standards. I inherit nothing. Istand at the end of no tradition. I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning ofone.”“How old are you?” asked the Dean.“Twenty-two,” said Roark.“Quite excusable,” said the Dean; he seemed relieved. “You’ll outgrow all that.”He smiled. “The old standards have lived for thousands of years and nobody hasbeen able to improve upon them. What are your modernists? A transient mode,exhibitionists trying to attract attention. Have you observed the course oftheir careers? Can you name one who has achieved any permanent distinction? Lookat Henry Cameron. A great man, a leading architect twenty years ago. What is hetoday? Lucky if he gets—once a year—a garage to remodel. A bum and a drunkard,who . . .”“We won’t discuss Henry Cameron.”“Oh? Is he a friend of yours?”“No. But I’ve seen his buildings.”“And you found them . . .”“I said we won’t discuss Henry Cameron.”“Very well. You must realize that I am allowing you a great deal of . . . shallwe say, latitude? I am not accustomed to hold a discussion with a student whobehaves in your manner. However, I am anxious to forestall, if possible, whatappears to be a tragedy, the spectacle of a young man of your obvious mentalgifts setting out deliberately to make a mess of his life.”The Dean wondered why he had promised the professor of mathematics to do all hecould for this boy. Merely because the professor had said: “This,” and pointedto Roark’s project, “is a great man.” A great man, thought the Dean, or acriminal. The Dean winced. He did not approve of either.He thought of what he had heard about Roark’s past. Roark’s father had been asteel puddler somewhere in Ohio and had died long ago. The boy’s entrance papersshowed no record of nearest relatives. When asked about it, Roark had saidindifferently: “I don’t think I have any relatives. I may have. I don’t know.”He had seemed astonished that he should be expected to have any interest in thematter. He had not made or sought a single friend on the campus. He had refusedto join a fraternity. He had worked his way through high school and through thethree years here at the Institute. He had worked as a common laborer in thebuilding trades since childhood. He had done plastering, plumbing, steel work,anything he could get, going from one small town to another, working his wayeast, to the great cities. The Dean had seen him, last summer, on his vacation,catching rivets on a skyscraper in construction in Boston; his long body relaxedunder greasy overalls, only his eyes intent, and his right arm swinging forward,once in a while, expertly, without effort, to catch the flying ball of fire atthe last moment, when it seemed that the hot rivet would miss the bucket andstrike him in the face.“Look here, Roark,” said the Dean gently. “You have worked hard for youreducation. You had only one year left to go. There is something important toconsider, particularly for a boy in your position. There’s the practical side ofan architect’s career to think about. An architect is not an end in himself. Heis only a small part of a great social whole. Co-operation is the key word toour modern world and to the profession of architecture in particular. Have youthought of your potential clients?”“Yes,” said Roark.“The Client,” said the Dean. “The Client. Think of that above all. He’s the oneto live in the house you build. Your only purpose is to serve him. You mustaspire to give the proper artistic expression to his wishes. Isn’t that all onecan say on the subject?”“Well, I could say that I must aspire to build for my client the mostcomfortable, the most logical, the most beautiful house that can be built. Icould say that I must try to sell him the best I have and also teach him to knowthe best. I could say it, but I won’t. Because I don’t intend to build in orderto serve or help anyone. I don’t intend to build in order to have clients. Iintend to have clients in order to build.”“How do you propose to force your ideas on them?”“I don’t propose to force or be forced. Those who want me will come to me.”Then the Dean understood what had puzzled him in Roark’s manner.“You know,” he said, “you would sound much more convincing if you spoke as ifyou cared whether I agreed with you or not.”“That’s true,” said Roark. “I don’t care whether you agree with me or not.” Hesaid it so simply that it did not sound offensive, it sounded like the statementof a fact which he noticed, puzzled, for the first time.“You don’t care what others think—which might be understandable. But you don’tcare even to make them think as you do?”“No.”“But that’s . . . that’s monstrous.”“Is it? Probably. I couldn’t say.”“I’m glad of this interview,” said the Dean, suddenly, too loudly. “It hasrelieved my conscience. I believe, as others stated at the meeting, that theprofession of architecture is not for you. I have tried to help you. Now I agreewith the Board. You are a man not to be encouraged. You are dangerous.”“To whom?” asked Roark.But the Dean rose, indicating that the interview was over.Roark left the room. He walked slowly through the long halls, down the stairs,out to the lawn below. He had met many men such as the Dean; he had neverunderstood them. He knew only that there was some important difference betweenhis actions and theirs. It had ceased to disturb him long ago. But he alwayslooked for a central theme in buildings and he looked for a central impulse inmen. He knew the source of his actions; he could not discover theirs. He did notcare. He had never learned the process of thinking about other people. But hewondered, at times, what made them such as they were. He wondered again,thinking of the Dean. There was an important secret involved somewhere in thatquestion, he thought. There was a principle which he must discover.But he stopped. He saw the sunlight of late afternoon, held still in the momentbefore it was to fade, on the gray limestone of a stringcourse running along thebrick wall of the Institute building. He forgot men, the Dean and the principlebehind the Dean, which he wanted to discover. He thought only of how lovely thestone looked in the fragile light and of what he could have done with thatstone.He thought of a broad sheet of paper, and he saw, rising on the paper, barewalls of gray limestone with long bands of glass, admitting the glow of the skyinto the classrooms. In the corner of the sheet stood a sharp, angularsignature—HOWARD ROARK.003 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_003_r1.jpg]“. . . ARCHITECTURE, my friends, is a great Art based on two cosmic principles:Beauty and Utility. In a broader sense, these are but part of the three eternalentities: Truth, Love and Beauty. Truth—to the traditions of our Art, Love—forour fellow men whom we are to serve, Beauty—ah, Beauty is a compelling goddessto all artists, be it in the shape of a lovely woman or a building.... Hm....Yes.... In conclusion, I should like to say to you, who are about to embark uponyour careers in architecture, that you are now the custodians of a sacredheritage.... Hm.... Yes.... So, go forth into the world, armed with the threeeternal entities—armed with courage and vision, loyal to the standards thisgreat school has represented for many years. May you all serve faithfully,neither as slaves to the past nor as those parvenus who preach originality forits own sake, which attitude is only ignorant vanity. May you all have manyrich, active years before you and leave, as you depart from this world, yourmark on the sands of time!”Guy Francon ended with a flourish, raising his right arm in a sweeping salute;informal, but with an air, that gay, swaggering air which Guy Francon couldalways permit himself. The huge hall before him came to life in applause andapproval.A sea of faces, young, perspiring and eager, had been raised solemnly—forforty-five minutes—to the platform where Guy Francon had held forth as thespeaker at the commencement exercises of the Stanton Institute of Technology,Guy Francon who had brought his own person from New York for the occasion; GuyFrancon, of the illustrious firm of Francon & Heyer, vice-president of theArchitects’ Guild of America, member of the American Academy of Arts andLetters, member of the National Fine Arts Commission, Secretary of the Arts andCrafts League of New York, chairman of the Society for ArchitecturalEnlightenment of the U.S.A.; Guy Francon, knight of the Legion of Honor ofFrance, decorated by the governments of Great Britain, Belgium, Monaco and Siam;Guy Francon, Stanton’s greatest alumnus, who had designed the famous FrinkNational Bank Building of New York City, on the top of which, twenty-five floorsabove the pavements, there burned in a miniature replica of the HadrianMausoleum a wind-blown torch made of glass and the best General Electric bulbs.Guy Francon descended from the platform, fully conscious of his timing andmovements. He was of medium height and not too heavy, with just an unfortunatetendency to stoutness. Nobody, he knew, would give him his real age, which wasfifty-one. His face bore not a wrinkle nor a single straight line; it was anartful composition in globes, circles, arcs and ellipses, with bright littleeyes twinkling wittily. His clothes displayed an artist’s infinite attention todetails. He wished, as he descended the steps, that this were a co-educationalschool.The hall before him, he thought, was a splendid specimen of architecture, made abit stuffy today by the crowd and by the neglected problem of ventilation. Butit boasted green marble dadoes, Corinthian columns of cast iron painted gold,and garlands of gilded fruit on the walls; the pineapples particularly, thoughtGuy Francon, had stood the test of years very well. It is, thought Guy Francon,touching; it was I who built this annex and this very hall, twenty years ago;and here I am.The hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could notdistinguish at a glance which faces belonged to which bodies. It was like asoft, shivering aspic made of mixed arms, shoulders, chests and stomachs. One ofthe heads, pale, dark haired and beautiful, belonged to Peter Keating.He sat, well in front, trying to keep his eyes on the platform, because he knewthat many people were looking at him and would look at him later. He did notglance back, but the consciousness of those centered glances never left him. Hiseyes were dark, alert, intelligent. His mouth, a small upturned crescentfaultlessly traced, was gentle and generous, and warm with the faint promise ofa smile. His head had a certain classical perfection in the shape of the skull,in the natural wave of black ringlets about finely hollowed temples. He held hishead in the manner of one who takes his beauty for granted, but knows thatothers do not. He was Peter Keating, star student of Stanton, president of thestudent body, captain of the track team, member of the most importantfraternity, voted the most popular man on the campus.The crowd was there, thought Peter Keating, to see him graduate, and he tried toestimate the capacity of the hall. They knew of his scholastic record and no onewould beat his record today. Oh, well, there was Shlinker. Shlinker had givenhim stiff competition, but he had beaten Shlinker this last year. He had workedlike a dog, because he had wanted to beat Shlinker. He had no rivals today....Then he felt suddenly as if something had fallen down, inside his throat, to hisstomach, something cold and empty, a blank hole rolling down and leaving thatfeeling on its way: not a thought, just the hint of a question asking himwhether he was really as great as this day would proclaim him to be. He lookedfor Shlinker in the crowd; he saw his yellow face and gold-rimmed glasses. Hestared at Shlinker warmly, in relief, in reassurance, in gratitude. It wasobvious that Shlinker could never hope to equal his own appearance or ability;he had nothing to doubt; he would always beat Shlinker and all the Shlinkers ofthe world; he would let no one achieve what he could not achieve. Let them allwatch him. He would give them good reason to stare. He felt the hot breathsabout him and the expectation, like a tonic. It was wonderful, thought PeterKeating, to be alive.His head was beginning to reel a little. It was a pleasant feeling. The feelingcarried him, unresisting and unremembering, to the platform in front of allthose faces. He stood—slender, trim, athletic—and let the deluge break upon hishead. He gathered from its roar that he had graduated with honors, that theArchitects’ Guild of America had presented him with a gold medal and that he hadbeen awarded the Prix de Paris by the Society for Architectural Enlightenment ofthe U.S.A.—a four-year scholarship at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris.Then he was shaking hands, scratching the perspiration off his face with the endof a rolled parchment, nodding, smiling, suffocating in his black gown andhoping that people would not notice his mother sobbing with her arms about him.The President of the Institute shook his hand, booming: “Stanton will be proudof you, my boy.” The Dean shook his hand, repeating: “. . . a glorious future .. . a glorious future . . . a glorious future . . .” Professor Peterkin shookhis hand, and patted his shoulder, saying: ”. . . and you’ll find it absolutelyessential; for example, I had the experience when I built the Peabody PostOffice . . .” Keating did not listen to the rest, because he had heard the storyof the Peabody Post Office many times. It was the only structure anyone had everknown Professor Peterkin to have erected, before he sacrificed his practice tothe responsibilities of teaching. A great deal was said about Keating’s finalproject—a Palace of Fine Arts. For the life of him, Keating could not rememberat the moment what that project was.Through all this, his eyes held the vision of Guy Francon shaking his hand, andhis ears held the sounds of Francon’s mellow voice: “. . . as I have told you,it is still open, my boy. Of course, now that you have this scholarship . . .you will have to decide . . . a Beaux-Arts diploma is very important to a youngman . . . but I should be delighted to have you in our office....”The banquet of the Class of ’22 was long and solemn. Keating listened to thespeeches with interest; when he heard the endless sentences about “young men asthe hope of American Architecture” and “the future opening its golden gates,” heknew that he was the hope and his was the future, and it was pleasant to hearthis confirmation from so many eminent lips. He looked at the gray-hairedorators and thought of how much younger he would be when he reached theirpositions, theirs and beyond them.Then he thought suddenly of Howard Roark. He was surprised to find that theflash of that name in his memory gave him a sharp little twinge of pleasure,before he could know why. Then he remembered: Howard Roark had been expelledthis morning. He reproached himself silently; he made a determined effort tofeel sorry. But the secret glow came back, whenever he thought of thatexpulsion. The event proved conclusively that he had been a fool to imagineRoark a dangerous rival; at one time, he had worried about Roark more than aboutShlinker, even though Roark was two years younger and one class below him. If hehad ever entertained any doubts on their respective gifts, hadn’t this daysettled it all? And, he remembered, Roark had been very nice to him, helping himwhenever he was stuck on a problem . . . not stuck, really, just did not havethe time to think it out, a plan or something. Christ! how Roark could untanglea plan, like pulling a string and it was open . . . well, what if he could? Whatdid it get him? He was done for now. And knowing this, Peter Keating experiencedat last a satisfying pang of sympathy for Howard Roark.When Keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. He could not showthat he was terrified. He had nothing to say about architecture. But he spoke,his head high, as an equal among equals, just subtly diffident, so that no greatname present could take offense. He remembered saying: “Architecture is a greatart . . . with our eyes to the future and the reverence of the past in ourhearts . . . of all the crafts, the most important one sociologically . . . and,as the man who is an inspiration to us all has said today, the three eternalentities are: Truth, Love and Beauty. . . .”Then, in the corridors outside, in the noisy confusion of leave-taking, a boyhad thrown an arm about Keating’s shoulders and whispered: “Run on home and getout of the soup-and-fish, Pete, and it’s Boston for us tonight, just our owngang; I’ll pick you up in an hour.” Ted Shlinker had urged: “Of course you’recoming, Pete. No fun without you. And, by the way, congratulations and all thatsort of thing. No hard feelings. May the best man win.” Keating had thrown hisarm about Shlinker’s shoulders; Keating’s eyes had glowed with an insistent kindof warmth, as if Shlinker were his most precious friend; Keating’s eyes glowedlike that on everybody. He had said: “Thanks, Ted, old man. I really do feelawful about the A.G.A. medal—I think you were the one for it, but you never cantell what possesses those old fogies.” And now Keating was on his way homethrough the soft darkness, wondering how to get away from his mother for thenight.His mother, he thought, had done a great deal for him. As she pointed outfrequently, she was a lady and had graduated from high school; yet she hadworked hard, had taken boarders into their home, a concession unprecedented inher family.His father had owned a stationery store in Stanton. Changing times had ended thebusiness and a hernia had ended Peter Keating, Sr., twelve years ago. LouisaKeating had been left with the home that stood at the end of a respectablestreet, an annuity from an insurance kept up accurately—she had seen to that—andher son. The annuity was a modest one, but with the help of the boarders and ofa tenacious purpose Mrs. Keating had managed. In the summers her son helped,clerking in hotels or posing for hat advertisements. Her son, Mrs. Keating haddecided, would assume his rightful place in the world, and she had clung to thisas softly, as inexorably as a leech.... It’s funny, Keating remembered, at onetime he had wanted to be an artist. It was his mother who had chosen a betterfield in which to exercise his talent for drawing. “Architecture,” she had said,“is such a respectable profession. Besides, you meet the best people in it.” Shehad pushed him into his career, he had never known when or how. It’s funny,thought Keating, he had not remembered that youthful ambition of his for years.It’s funny that it should hurt him now—to remember. Well, this was the night toremember it—and to forget it forever.Architects, he thought, always made brilliant careers. And once on top, did theyever fail? Suddenly, he recalled Henry Cameron; builder of skyscrapers twentyyears ago; old drunkard with offices on some wa-terfront today. Keatingshuddered and walked faster.He wondered, as he walked, whether people were looking at him. He watched therectangles of lighted windows; when a curtain fluttered and a head leaned out,he tried to guess whether it had leaned to watch his passing; if it hadn’t, someday it would; some day, they all would.Howard Roark was sitting on the porch steps when Keating approached the house.He was leaning back against the steps, propped up on his elbows, his long legsstretched out. A morning-glory climbed over the porch pillars, as a curtainbetween the house and the light of a lamppost on the corner.It was strange to see an electric globe in the air of a spring night. It madethe street darker and softer; it hung alone, like a gap, and left nothing to beseen but a few branches heavy with leaves, standing still at the gap’s edges.The small hint became immense, as if the darkness held nothing but a flood ofleaves. The mechanical ball of glass made the leaves seem more living; it tookaway their color and gave the promise that in daylight they would be a brightergreen than had ever existed; it took away one’s sight and left a new senseinstead, neither smell nor touch, yet both, a sense of spring and space.Keating stopped when he recognized the preposterous orange hair in the darknessof the porch. It was the one person whom he had wanted to see tonight. He wasglad to find Roark alone, and a little afraid of it.“Congratulations, Peter,” said Roark.“Oh ... Oh, thanks....” Keating was surprised to find that he felt more pleasurethan from any other compliment he had received today. He was timidly glad thatRoark approved, and he called himself inwardly a fool for it. “... I mean . . .do you know or . . .” He added sharply: “Has Mother been telling you?”“She has.”“She shouldn’t have!”“Why not?”“Look, Howard, you know that I’m terribly sorry about your being . . .”Roark threw his head back and looked up at him.“Forget it,” said Roark.“I ... there’s something I want to speak to you about, Howard, to ask youradvice. Mind if I sit down?”“What is it?”Keating sat down on the steps beside him. There was no part that he could everplay in Roark’s presence. Besides, he did not feel like playing a part now. Heheard a leaf rustling in its fall to the earth; it was a thin, glassy, springsound.He knew, for the moment, that he felt affection for Roark; an affection thatheld pain, astonishment and helplessness.“You won’t think,” said Keating gently, in complete sincerity, “that it’s awfulof me to be asking about my business, when you’ve just been . . . ?”“I said forget about that. What is it?”“You know,” said Keating honestly and unexpectedly even to himself, “I’ve oftenthought that you’re crazy. But I know that you know many things aboutit—architecture, I mean—which those fools never knew. And I know that you loveit as they never will.”“Well?”“Well, I don’t know why I should come to you, but—Howard, I’ve never said itbefore, but you see, I’d rather have your opinion on things than the Dean‘s—I’dprobably follow the Dean’s, but it’s just that yours means more to me myself, Idon’t know why. I don’t know why I’m saying this, either.”Roark turned over on his side, looked at him, and laughed. It was a young, kind,friendly laughter, a thing so rare to hear from Roark that Keating felt as ifsomeone had taken his hand in reassurance; and he forgot that he had a party inBoston waiting for him.“Come on,” said Roark, “you’re not being afraid of me, are you? What do you wantto ask about?”“It’s about my scholarship. The Paris prize I got.”“Yes?”“It’s for four years. But, on the other hand, Guy Francon offered me a job withhim some time ago. Today he said it’s still open. And I don’t know which totake.”Roark looked at him; Roark’s fingers moved in slow rotation, beating against thesteps.“If you want my advice, Peter,” he said at last, “you’ve made a mistake already.By asking me. By asking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work. Don’t youknow what you want? How can you stand it, not to know?”“You see, that’s what I admire about you, Howard. You always know.”“Drop the compliments.”“But I mean it. How do you always manage to decide?”“How can you let others decide for you?”“But you see, I’m not sure, Howard. I’m never sure of myself. I don’t knowwhether I’m as good as they all tell me I am. I wouldn’t admit that to anyonebut you. I think it’s because you’re always so sure that I . . .”“Petey!” Mrs. Keating’s voice exploded behind them. “Petey, sweetheart! What areyou doing there?”She stood in the doorway, in her best dress of burgundy taffeta, happy andangry.“And here I’ve been sitting all alone, waiting for you! What on earth are youdoing on those filthy steps in your dress suit? Get up this minute! Come on inthe house, boys. I’ve got hot chocolate and cookies ready for you.”“But, Mother. I wanted to speak to Howard about something important,” saidKeating. But he rose to his feet.She seemed not to have heard. She walked into the house. Keating followed.Roark looked after them, shrugged, rose and went in also.Mrs. Keating settled down in an armchair, her stiff skirt crackling.“Well?” she asked. “What were you two discussing out there?”Keating fingered an ash tray, picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then,ignoring her, turned to Roark.“Look, Howard, drop the pose,” he said, his voice high. “Shall I junk thescholarship and go to work, or let Francon wait and grab the Beaux-Arts toimpress the yokels? What do you think?”Something was gone. The one moment was lost.“Now, Petey, let me get this straight . . .” began Mrs. Keating.“Oh, wait a minute, Mother! ... Howard, I’ve got to weigh it carefully. It isn’teveryone who can get a scholarship like that. You’re pretty good when you ratethat. A course at the Beaux-Arts—you know how important that is.”“I don’t,” said Roark.“Oh, hell, I know your crazy ideas, but I’m speaking practically, for a man inmy position. Ideals aside for a moment, it certainly is . . .”“You don’t want my advice,” said Roark.“Of course I do! I’m asking you!”But Keating could never be the same when he had an audience, any audience.Something was gone. He did not know it, but he felt that Roark knew; Roark’seyes made him uncomfortable and that made him angry.“I want to practice architecture,” snapped Keating, “not talk about it! Givesyou a great prestige—the old Ecole. Puts you above the rank and file of theex-plumbers who think they can build. On the other hand, an opening withFrancon—Guy Francon himself offering it!”Roark turned away.“How many boys will match that?” Keating went on blindly. “A year from nowthey’ll be boasting they’re working for Smith or Jones if they find work at all.While I’ll be with Francon & Heyer!”“You’re quite right, Peter,” said Mrs. Keating, rising. “On a question like thatyou don’t want to consult your mother. It’s too important. I’ll leave you tosettle it with Mr. Roark.”He looked at his mother. He did not want to hear what she thought of this; heknew that his only chance to decide was to make the decision before he heardher; she had stopped, looking at him, ready to turn and leave the room; he knewit was not a pose—she would leave if he wished it; he wanted her to go; hewanted it desperately. He said:“Why, Mother, how can you say that? Of course I want your opinion. What . . .what do you think?”She ignored the raw irritation in his voice. She smiled.“Petey, I never think anything. It’s up to you. It’s always been up to you.”“Well . . .” he began hesitantly, watching her, “if I go to the Beaux-Arts . ..”“Fine,” said Mrs. Keating, “go to the Beaux-Arts. It’s a grand place. A wholeocean away from your home. Of course, if you go, Mr. Francon will take somebodyelse. People will talk about that. Everybody knows that Mr. Francon picks outthe best boy from Stanton every year for his office. I wonder how it’ll look ifsome other boy gets the job? But I guess that doesn’t matter.”“What . . . what will people say?”“Nothing much, I guess. Only that the other boy was the best man of his class. Iguess he’ll take Shlinker.”“No!” he gulped furiously. “Not Shlinker!”“Yes,” she said sweetly. “Shlinker.”“But . . .”“But why should you care what people will say? All you have to do is pleaseyourself.”“And you think that Francon . . .”“Why should I think of Mr. Francon? It’s nothing to me.”“Mother, you want me to take the job with Francon?”“I don’t want anything, Petey. You’re the boss.”He wondered whether he really liked his mother. But she was his mother and thisfact was recognized by everybody as meaning automatically that he loved her, andso he took for granted that whatever he felt for her was love. He did not knowwhether there was any reason why he should respect her judgment. She was hismother; this was supposed to take the place of reasons.“Yes, of course, Mother. . . . But . . . Yes, I know, but . . . Howard?”It was a plea for help. Roark was there, on a davenport in the corner, halflying, sprawled limply like a kitten. It had often astonished Keating; he hadseen Roark moving with the soundless tension, the control, the precision of acat; he had seen him relaxed, like a cat, in shapeless ease, as if his body heldno single solid bone. Roark glanced up at him. He said:“Peter, you know how I feel about either one of your opportunities. Take yourchoice of the lesser evil. What will you learn at the Beaux-Arts? Only moreRenaissance palaces and operetta settings. They’ll kill everything you mighthave in you. You do good work, once in a while, when somebody lets you. If youreally want to learn, go to work. Francon is a bastard and a fool, but you willbe building. It will prepare you for going on your own that much sooner.”“Even Mr. Roark can talk sense sometimes,” said Mrs. Keating, “even if he doestalk like a truck driver.”“Do you really think that I do good work?” Keating looked at him, as if his eyesstill held the reflection of that one sentence—and nothing else mattered.“Occasionally,” said Roark. “Not often.”“Now that it’s all settled . . .” began Mrs. Keating.“I ... I’ll have to think it over, Mother.”“Now that it’s all settled, how about the hot chocolate? I’ll have it out to youin a jiffy!”She smiled at her son, an innocent smile that declared her obedience andgratitude, and she rustled out of the room.Keating paced nervously, stopped, lighted a cigarette, stood spitting the smokeout in short jerks, then looked at Roark.“What are you going to do now, Howard?”“I?”“Very thoughtless of me, I know, going on like that about myself. Mother meanswell, but she drives me crazy. . . . Well, to hell with that. What are you goingto do?”“I’m going to New York.”“Oh, swell. To get a job?”“To get a job.”“In . . . in architecture?”“In architecture, Peter.”“That’s grand. I’m glad. Got any definite prospects?”“I’m going to work for Henry Cameron.”“Oh, no, Howard!”Roark smiled slowly, the corners of his mouth sharp, and said nothing.“Oh, no, Howard!”“Yes.”“But he’s nothing, nobody any more! Oh, I know he has a name, but he’s done for!He never gets any important buildings, hasn’t had any for years! They say he’sgot a dump for an office. What kind of future will you get out of him? What willyou learn?”“Not much. Only how to build.”“For God’s sake, you can’t go on like that, deliberately ruining yourself! Ithought . . . well, yes, I thought you’d learned something today!”“I have.”“Look, Howard, if it’s because you think that no one else will have you now, noone better, why, I’ll help you. I’ll work old Francon and I’ll get connectionsand . . .”“Thank you, Peter. But it won’t be necessary. It’s settled.”“What did he say?”“Who?”“Cameron.”“I’ve never met him.”Then a horn screamed outside. Keating remembered, started off to change hisclothes, collided with his mother at the door and knocked a cup off her loadedtray.“Petey!”“Never mind, Mother!” He seized her elbows. “I’m in a hurry, sweetheart. Alittle party with the boys—now, now, don’t say anything—I won’t be lateand—look! We’ll celebrate my going with Francon & Heyer!”He kissed her impulsively, with the gay exuberance that made him irresistible attimes, and flew out of the room, up the stairs. Mrs. Keating shook her head,flustered, reproving and happy.In his room, while flinging his clothes in all directions, Keating thoughtsuddenly of a wire he would send to New York. That particular subject had notbeen in his mind all day, but it came to him with a sense of desperate urgency;he wanted to send that wire now, at once. He scribbled it down on a piece ofpaper:“Katie dearest coming New York job Francon love ever“Peter”That night Keating raced toward Boston, wedged in between two boys, the wind andthe road whistling past him. And he thought that the world was opening to himnow, like the darkness fleeing before the bobbing headlights. He was free. Hewas ready. In a few years—so very soon, for time did not exist in the speed ofthat car—his name would ring like a horn, ripping people out of sleep. He wasready to do great things, magnificent things, things unsurpassed in ... in ...oh, hell ... in architecture.004 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_004_r1.jpg]PETER KEATING looked at the streets of New York. The people, he observed, wereextremely well dressed.He had stopped for a moment before the building on Fifth Avenue, where theoffice of Francon & Heyer and his first day of work awaited him. He looked atthe men who hurried past. Smart, he thought, smart as hell. He glancedregretfully at his own clothes. He had a great deal to learn in New York.When he could delay it no longer, he turned to the door. It was a miniatureDoric portico, every inch of it scaled down to the exact proportions decreed bythe artists who had worn flowing Grecian tunics; between the marble perfectionof the columns a revolving door sparkled with nickel-plate, reflecting thestreaks of automobiles flying past. Keating walked through the revolving door,through the lustrous marble lobby, to an elevator of gilt and red lacquer thatbrought him, thirty floors later, to a mahogany door. He saw a slender brassplate with delicate letters: FRANCON & HEYER, ARCHITECTS. The reception room of the office of Francon & Heyer, Architects, looked like acool, intimate ballroom in a Colonial mansion. The silver white walls werepaneled with flat pilasters; the pilasters were fluted and curved into Ionicsnails; they supported little pediments broken in the middle to make room forhalf a Grecian urn plastered against the wall. Etchings of Greek temples adornedthe panels, too small to be distinguished, but presenting the unmistakablecolumns, pediments and crumbling stone.Quite incongruously, Keating felt as if a conveyor belt was under his feet, fromthe moment he crossed the threshold. It carried him to the reception clerk whosat at a telephone switchboard behind the white balustrade of a Florentinebalcony. It transferred him to the threshold of a huge drafting room. He sawlong, flat tables, a forest of twisted rods descending from the ceiling to endin green-shaded lamps, enormous blueprint files, towers of yellow drawers,papers, tin boxes, sample bricks, pots of glue and calendars from constructioncompanies, most of them bearing pictures of naked women. The chief draftsmansnapped at Keating, without quite seeing him. He was bored and crackling withpurpose simultaneously. He jerked his thumb in the direction of a locker room,thrust his chin out toward the door of a locker, and stood, rocking from heelsto toes, while Keating pulled a pearl-gray smock over his stiff, uncertain body.Francon had insisted on that smock. The conveyor belt stopped at a table in acorner of the drafting room, where Keating found himself with a set of plans toexpand, the scraggy back of the chief draftsman retreating from him in theunmistakable manner of having forgotten his existence.Keating bent over his task at once, his eyes fixed, his throat rigid. He sawnothing but the pearly shimmer of the paper before him. The steady lines he drewsurprised him, for he felt certain that his hand was jerking an inch back andforth across the sheet. He followed the lines, not knowing where they led orwhy. He knew only that the plan was someone’s tremendous achievement which hecould neither question nor equal. He wondered why he had ever thought of himselfas a potential architect.Much later, he noticed the wrinkles of a gray smock sticking to a pair ofshoulder blades over the next table. He glanced about him, cautiously at first,then with curiosity, then with pleasure, then with contempt. When he reachedthis last, Peter Keating became himself again and felt love for mankind. Henoticed sallow cheeks, a funny nose, a wart on a receding chin, a stomachsquashed against the edge of a table. He loved these sights. What these coulddo, he could do better. He smiled. Peter Keating needed his fellow men.When he glanced at his plans again, he noticed the flaws glaring at him from themasterpiece. It was the floor of a private residence, and he noted the twistedhallways that sliced great hunks of space for no apparent reason, the long,rectangular sausages of rooms doomed to darkness. Jesus, he thought, they’d haveflunked me for this in the first term. After which, he proceeded with his workswiftly, easily, expertly—and happily.Before lunchtime. Keating had made friends in the room, not any definitefriends, but a vague soil spread and ready from which friendship would spring.He had smiled at his neighbors and winked in understanding over nothing at all.He had used each trip to the water cooler to caress those he passed with thesoft, cheering glow of his eyes, the brilliant eyes that seemed to pick each manin turn out of the room, out of the universe, as the most important specimen ofhumanity and as Keating’s dearest friend. There goes—there seemed to be left inhis wake—a smart boy and a hell of a good fellow.Keating noticed that a tall blond youth at the next table was doing theelevation of an office building. Keating leaned with chummy respect against theboy’s shoulder and looked at the laurel garlands entwined about fluted columnsthree floors high.“Pretty good for the old man,”said Keating with admiration.“Who?” asked the boy.“Why, Francon,” said Keating.“Francon hell,” said the boy placidly. “He hasn’t designed a dog-house in eightyears.” He jerked his thumb over his shoulder, at a glass door behind them.“Him.”“What?” asked Keating, turning.“Him,” said the boy. “Stengel. He does all these things.”Behind the glass door Keating saw a pair of bony shoulders above the edge of adesk, a small, triangular head bent intently, and two blank pools of light inthe round frames of glasses.It was late in the afternoon when a presence seemed to have passed beyond theclosed door, and Keating learned from the rustle of whispers around him that GuyFrancon had arrived and had risen to his office on the floor above. Half an hourlater the glass door opened and Stengel came out, a huge piece of cardboarddangling between his fingers.“Hey, you,” he said, his glasses stopping on Keating’s face. “You doing theplans for this?” He swung the cardboard forward. “Take this up to the boss forthe okay. Try to listen to what he’ll say and try to look intelligent. Neitherof which matters anyway.”He was short and his arms seemed to hang down to his ankles; arms swinging likeropes in the long sleeves, with big, efficient hands. Keating’s eyes froze,darkening, for one-tenth of a second, gathered in a tight stare at the blanklenses. Then Keating smiled and said pleasantly:“Yes, sir.”He carried the cardboard on the tips of his ten fingers, up the crimson-plushedstairway to Guy Francon’s office. The cardboard displayed a water-colorperspective of a gray granite mansion with three tiers of dormers, fivebalconies, four bays, twelve columns, one flag-pole and two lions at theentrance. In the corner, neatly printed by hand, stood: “Residence of Mr. andMrs. James S. Whattles. Francon & Heyer, Architects.” Keating whistled softly:James S. Whattles was the multimillionaire manufacturer of shaving lotions.Guy Francon’s office was polished. No, thought Keating, not polished, butshellacked; no, not shellacked, but liquid with mirrors melted and poured overevery object. He saw splinters of his own reflection let loose like a swarm ofbutterflies, following him across the room, on the Chippendale cabinets, on theJacobean chairs, on the Louis XV mantelpiece. He had time to note a genuineRoman statue in a comer, sepia photographs of the Parthenon, of RheimsCathedral, of Versailles and of the Frink National Bank Building with theeternal torch.He saw his own legs approaching him in the side of the massive mahogany desk.Guy Francon sat behind the desk. Guy Francon’s face was yellow and his cheekssagged. He looked at Keating for an instant as if he had never seen him before,then remembered and smiled expansively.“Well, well, well, Kittredge, my boy, here we are, all set and at home! So gladto see you. Sit down, boy, sit down, what have you got there? Well, there’s nohurry, no hurry at all. Sit down. How do you like it here?”“I’m afraid, sir, that I’m a little too happy,” said Keating, with an expressionof frank, boyish helplessness. “I thought I could be busi-nesslike on my firstjob, but starting in a place like this . . . I guess it knocked me out alittle.... I’ll get over it, sir,” he promised.“Of course,” said Guy Francon. “It might be a bit overwhelming for a boy, just abit. But don’t you worry. I’m sure you’ll make good.”“I’ll do my best, sir.”“Of course you will. What’s this they sent me?” Francon extended his hand to thedrawing, but his fingers came to rest limply on his forehead instead. “It’s soannoying, this headache.... No, no, nothing serious—” he smiled at Keating’sprompt concern—“just a little mal de tête. One works so hard.”“Is there anything I can get for you, sir?”“No, no, thank you. It’s not anything you can get for me, it’s if only you couldtake something away from me.” He winked. “The champagne. Entre nous, thatchampagne of theirs wasn’t worth a damn last night. I’ve never cared forchampagne anyway. Let me tell you, Kittredge, it’s very important to know aboutwines, for instance when you’ll take a client out to dinner and will want to besure of the proper thing to order. Now I’ll tell you a professional secret. Takequail, for instance. Now most people would order Burgundy with it. What do youdo? You call for Clos Vougeot 1904. See? Adds that certain touch. Correct, butoriginal. One must always be original.... Who sent you up, by the way?”“Mr. Stengel, sir.”“Oh, Stengel.” The tone in which he pronounced the name clicked like a shutterin Keating’s mind: it was a permission to be stored away for future use. “Toogrand to bring his own stuff up, eh? Mind you, he’s a great designer, the bestdesigner in New York City, but he’s just getting to be a bit too grand lately.He thinks he’s the only one doing any work around here, just because he smudgesat a board all day long. You’ll learn, my boy, when you’ve been in the businesslonger, that the real work of an office is done beyond its walls. Take lastnight, for instance. Banquet of the Clarion Real Estate Association. Two hundredguests—dinner and champagne—oh, yes, champagne!” He wrinkled his nosefastidiously, in self-mockery. “A few words to say informally in a littleafter-dinner speech—you know, nothing blatant, no vulgar sales tatk—only a fewwell-chosen thoughts on the responsibility of realtors to society, on theimportance of selecting architects who are competent, respected and wellestablished. You know, a few bright little slogans that will stick in the mind.”“Yes, sir, like ‘Choose the builder of your home as carefully as you choose thebride to inhabit it.’ ”“Not bad. Not bad at all, Kittredge. Mind if I jot it down?”“My name is Keating, sir,” said Keating firmly. “You are very welcome to theidea. I’m happy if it appeals to you.”“Keating, of course! Why, of course, Keating,” said Francon with a disarmingsmile. “Dear me, one meets so many people. How did you say it? Choose thebuilder . . . it was very well put.”He made Keating repeat it and wrote it down on a pad, picking a pencil from anarray before him, new, many-colored pencils, sharpened to a professional needlepoint, ready, unused.Then he pushed the pad aside, sighed, patted the smooth waves of his hair andsaid wearily:“Well, all right, I suppose I’ll have to look at the thing.”Keating extended the drawing respectfully. Francon leaned back, held thecardboard out at arm’s length and looked at it. He closed his left eye, then hisright eye, then moved the cardboard an inch farther. Keating expected wildly tosee him turn the drawing upside down. But Francon just held it and Keating knewsuddenly that he had long since stopped seeing it. Francon was studying it forhis, Keating’s, benefit; and then Keating felt light, light as air, and he sawthe road to his future, clear and open.“Hm . . . yes,” Francon was saying, rubbing his chin with the tips of two softfingers. “Hm ... yes . . .”He turned to Keating.“Not bad,” said Francon. “Not bad at all.... Well . . . perhaps ... it wouldhave been more distinguished, you know, but ... well, the drawing is done soneatly.... What do you think, Keating?”Keating thought that four of the windows faced four mammoth granite columns. Buthe looked at Francon’s fingers playing with a petunia-mauve necktie, and decidednot to mention it. He said instead:“If I may make a suggestion, sir, it seems to me that the cartouches between thefourth and fifth floors are somewhat too modest for so imposing a building. Itwould appear that an ornamented stringcourse would be so much more appropriate.”“That’s it. I was just going to say it. An ornamented stringcourse.... But . . .but look, it would mean diminishing the fenestration, wouldn’t it?”“Yes,” said Keating, a faint coating of diffidence over the tone he had used indiscussions with his classmates, “but windows are less important than thedignity of a building’s façade.”“That’s right. Dignity. We must give our clients dignity above all. Yes,definitely, an ornamented stringcourse.... Only . . . look, I’ve approved thepreliminary drawings, and Stengel has had this done up so neatly.”“Mr. Stengel will be delighted to change it if you advise him to.”Francon’s eyes held Keating’s for a moment. Then Francon’s lashes dropped and hepicked a piece of lint off his sleeve.“Of course, of course . . .” he said vaguely. “But . . . do you think thestringcourse is really important?”“I think,” said Keating slowly, “it is more important to make changes you findnecessary than to okay every drawing just as Mr. Stengel designed it.”Because Francon said nothing, but only looked straight at him, because Francon’seyes were focused and his hands limp, Keating knew that he had taken a terriblechance and won; he became frightened by the chance after he knew he had won.They looked silently across the desk, and both saw that they were two men whocould understand each other.“We’ll have an ornamented stringcourse,” said Francon with calm, genuineauthority. “Leave this here. Tell Stengel that I want to see him.”He had turned to go. Francon stopped him. Francon’s voice was gay and warm:“Oh, Keating, by the way, may I make a suggestion? Just between us, no offenseintended, but a burgundy necktie would be so much better than blue with yourgray smock, don’t you think so?”“Yes, sir,” said Keating easily. “Thank you. You’ll see it tomorrow.”He walked out and closed the door softly.On his way back through the reception room, Keating saw a distinguished,gray-haired gentleman escorting a lady to the door. The gentleman wore no hatand obviously belonged to the office; the lady wore a mink cape, and wasobviously a client.The gentleman was not bowing to the ground, he was not unrolling a carpet, hewas not waving a fan over her head; he was only holding the door for her. Itmerely seemed to Keating that the gentleman was doing all of that. The Frink National Bank Building rose over Lower Manhattan, and its long shadowmoved, as the sun traveled over the sky, like a huge clock hand across grimytenements, from the Aquarium to Manhattan Bridge. When the sun was gone, thetorch of Hadrian’s Mausoleum flared up in its stead, and made glowing red smearson the glass of windows for miles around, on the top stories of buildings highenough to reflect it. The Frink National Bank Building displayed the entirehistory of Roman art in well-chosen specimens; for a long time it had beenconsidered the best building of the city, because no other structure could boasta single Classical item which it did not possess.It offered so many columns, pediments, friezes, tripods, gladiators, urns andvolutes that it looked as if it had not been built of white marble, but squeezedout of a pastry tube. It was, however, built of white marble. No one knew thatbut the owners who had paid for it. It was now of a streaked, blotched, leprouscolor, neither brown nor green but the worst tones of both, the color of slowrot, the color of smoke, gas fumes and acids eating into a delicate stoneintended for clean air and open country. The Frink National Bank Building,however, was a great success. It had been so great a success that it was thelast structure Guy Francon ever designed; its prestige spared him the botherfrom then on.Three blocks east of the Frink National Bank stood the Dana Building. It wassome stories lower and without any prestige whatever. Its lines were hard andsimple, revealing, emphasizing the harmony of the steel skeleton within, as abody reveals the perfection of its bones. It had no other ornament to offer. Itdisplayed nothing but the precision of its sharp angles, the modeling of itsplanes, the long streaks of its windows like streams of ice running down fromthe roof to the pavements. New Yorkers seldom looked at the Dana Building.Sometimes, a rare country visitor would come upon it unexpectedly in themoonlight and stop and wonder from what dream that vision had come. But suchvisitors were rare. The tenants of the Dana Building said that they would notexchange it for any structure on earth; they appreciated the light, the air, thebeautiful logic of the plan in their halls and offices. But the tenants of theDana Building were not numerous; no prominent man wished his business to belocated in a building that looked “like a warehouse.”The Dana Building had been designed by Henry Cameron.In the eighteen-eighties, the architects of New York fought one another forsecond place in their profession. No one aspired to the first. The first washeld by Henry Cameron. Henry Cameron was hard to get in those days. He had awaiting list two years in advance; he designed personally every structure thatleft his office. He chose what he wished to build. When he built, a client kepthis mouth shut. He demanded of all people the one thing he had never grantedanybody: obedience. He went through the years of his fame like a projectileflying to a goal no one could guess. People called him crazy. But they took whathe gave them, whether they understood it or not, because it was a building “byHenry Cameron.”At first, his buildings were merely a little different, not enough to frightenanyone. He made startling experiments, once in a while, but people expected itand one did not argue with Henry Cameron. Something was growing in him with eachnew building, struggling, taking shape, rising dangerously to an explosion. Theexplosion came with the birth of the skyscraper. When structures began to risenot in tier on ponderous tier of masonry, but as arrows of steel shooting upwardwithout weight or limit, Henry Cameron was among the first to understand thisnew miracle and to give it form. He was among the first and the few who acceptedthe truth that a tall building must look tall. While architects cursed,wondering how to make a twenty-story building look like an old brick mansion,while they used every horizontal device available in order to cheat it of itsheight, shrink it down to tradition, hide the shame of its steel, make it small,safe and ancient—Henry Cameron designed skyscrapers in straight, vertical lines,flaunting their steel and height. While architects drew friezes and pediments,Henry Cameron decided that the skyscraper must not copy the Greeks. HenryCameron decided that no building must copy any other.He was thirty-nine years old then, short, stocky, unkempt; he worked like a dog,missed his sleep and meals, drank seldom but then brutally, called his clientsunprintable names, laughed at hatred and fanned it deliberately, behaved like afeudal lord and a longshoreman, and lived in a passionate tension that stung menin any room he entered, a fire neither they nor he could endure much longer. Itwas the year 1892.The Columbian Exposition of Chicago opened in the year 1893.The Rome of two thousand years ago rose on the shores of Lake Michigan, a Romeimproved by pieces of France, Spain, Athens and every style that followed it. Itwas a “Dream City” of columns, triumphal arches, blue lagoons, crystal fountainsand popcorn. Its architects competed on who could steal best, from the oldestsource and from the most sources at once. It spread before the eyes of a newcountry every structural crime ever committed in all the old ones. It was whiteas a plague, and it spread as such.People came, looked, were astounded, and carried away with them, to the citiesof America, the seeds of what they had seen. The seeds sprouted into weeds; intoshingled post offices with Doric porticos, brick mansions with iron pediments,lofts made of twelve Parthenons piled on top of one another. The weeds grew andchoked everything else.Henry Cameron had refused to work for the Columbian Exposition, and had calledit names that were unprintable, but repeatable, though not in mixed company.They were repeated. It was repeated also that he had thrown an inkstand at theface of a distinguished banker who had asked him to design a railroad station inthe shape of the temple of Diana at Ephesus. The banker never came back. Therewere others who never came back.just as he reached the goal of long, struggling years, just as he gave shape tothe truth he had sought—the last barrier fell closed before him. A young countryhad watched him on his way, had wondered, had begun to accept the new grandeurof his work. A country flung two thousand years back in an orgy of Classicismcould find no place for him and no use.It was not necessary to design buildings any longer, only to photograph them;the architect with the best library was the best architect. Imitators copiedimitations. To sanction it there was Culture; there were twenty centuriesunrolling in moldering ruins; there was the great Exposition; there was everyEuropean post card in every family album.Henry Cameron had nothing to offer against this; nothing but a faith he heldmerely because it was his own. He had nobody to quote and nothing of importanceto say. He said only that the form of a building must follow its function; thatthe structure of a building is the key to its beauty; that new methods ofconstruction demand new forms; that he wished to build as he wished and for thatreason only. But people could not listen to him when they were discussingVitru-vius, Michelangelo and Sir Christopher Wren.Men hate passion, any great passion. Henry Cameron made a mistake: he loved hiswork. That was why he fought. That was why he lost.People said he never knew that he had lost. If he did, he never let them see it.As his clients became rarer, his manner to them grew more overbearing. The lessthe prestige of his name, the more arrogant the sound of his voice pronouncingit. He had had an astute business manager, a mild, self-effacing little man ofiron who, in the days of his glory, faced quietly the storms of Cameron’s temperand brought him clients; Cameron insulted the clients, but the little man madethem accept it and come back. The little man died.Cameron had never known how to face people. They did not matter to him, as hisown life did not matter, as nothing mattered but buildings. He had never learnedto give explanations, only orders. He had never been liked. He had been feared.No one feared him any longer.He was allowed to live. He lived to loathe the streets of the city he haddreamed of rebuilding. He lived to sit at the desk in his empty office,motionless, idle, waiting. He lived to read in a well-meaning newspaper accounta reference to “the late Henry Cameron.” He lived to begin drinking, quietly,steadily, terribly, for days and nights at a time; and to hear those who haddriven him to it say, when his name was mentioned for a commission: “Cameron? Ishould say not. He drinks like a fish. That’s why he never gets any work.” Helived to move from the offices that occupied three floors of a famous buildingto one floor on a less expensive street, then to a suite farther downtown, thento three rooms facing an air shaft, near the Battery. He chose these roomsbecause, by pressing his face to the window of his office, he could see, over abrick wall, the top of the Dana Building.Howard Roark looked at the Dana Building beyond the windows, stopping at eachlanding, as he mounted the six flights of stairs to Henry Cameron’s office; theelevator was out of order. The stairs had been painted a dirty file-green a longtime ago; a little of the paint remained to grate under shoe soles in crumblingpatches. Roark went up swiftly, as if he had an appointment, a folder of hisdrawings under his arm, his eyes on the Dana Building. He collided once with aman descending the stairs; this had happened to him often in the last two days;he had walked through the streets of the city, his head thrown back, noticingnothing but the buildings of New York.In the dark cubbyhole of Cameron’s anteroom stood a desk with a telephone and atypewriter. A gray-haired skeleton of a man sat at the desk, in his shirtsleeves, with a pair of limp suspenders over his shoulders. He was typingspecifications intently, with two fingers and incredible speed. The light from afeeble bulb made a pool of yellow on his back, where the damp shirt stuck to hisshoulder blades.The man raised his head slowly, when Roark entered. He looked at Roark, saidnothing and waited, his old eyes weary, unquestioning, incurious.“I should like to see Mr. Cameron,” said Roark.“Yeah?” said the man, without challenge, offense or meaning. “About what?”“About a job.”“What job?”“Drafting.”The man sat looking at him blankly. It was a request that had not confronted himfor a long time. He rose at last, without a word, shuffled to a door behind himand went in.He left the door half open. Roark heard him drawling:“Mr. Cameron, there’s a fellow outside says he’s looking for a job here.”Then a voice answered, a strong, clear voice that held no tones of age:“Why, the damn fool! Throw him out . . . Wait! Send him in!”The old man returned, held the door open and jerked his head at it silently.Roark went in. The door closed behind him.Henry Cameron sat at his desk at the end of a long, bare room. He sat bentforward, his forearms on the desk, his two hands closed before him. His hair andhis beard were coal black, with coarse threads of white. The muscles of hisshort, thick neck bulged like ropes. He wore a white shirt with the sleevesrolled above the elbows; the bare arms were hard, heavy and brown. The flesh ofhis broad face was rigid, as if it had aged by compression. The eyes were dark,young, living.Roark stood on the threshold and they looked at each other across the long room.The light from the air shaft was gray, and the dust on the drafting table, onthe few green files, looked like fuzzy crystals deposited by the light. But onthe wall, between the windows, Roark saw a picture. It was the only picture inthe room. It was the drawing of a skyscraper that had never been erected.Roark’s eyes moved first and they moved to the drawing. He walked across theoffice, stopped before it and stood looking at it. Cameron’s eyes followed him,a heavy glance, like a long, thin needle held fast at one end, describing a slowcircle, its point piercing Roark’s body, keeping it pinned firmly. Cameronlooked at the orange hair, at the hand hanging by his side, its palm to thedrawing, the fingers bent slightly, forgotten not in a gesture but in theoverture to a gesture of asking or seizing something.“Well?” said Cameron at last. “Did you come to see me or did you come to look atpictures?”Roark turned to him.“Both,” said Roark.He walked to the desk. People had always lost their sense of existence inRoark’s presence; but Cameron felt suddenly that he had never been as real as inthe awareness of the eyes now looking at him.“What do you want?” snapped Cameron.“I should like to work for you,” said Roark quietly. The voice said: “I shouldlike to work for you.” The tone of the voice said: “I’m going to work for you.”“Are you?” said Cameron, not realizing that he answered the un-pronouncedsentence. “What’s the matter? None of the bigger and better fellows will haveyou?”“I have not applied to anyone else.”“Why not? Do you think this is the easiest place to begin? Think anybody canwalk in here without trouble? Do you know who I am?”“Yes. That’s why I’m here.”“Who sent you?”“No one.”“Why the hell should you pick me?”“I think you know that.”“What infernal impudence made you presume that I’d want you? Have you decidedthat I’m so hard up that I’d throw the gates open for any punk who’d do me thehonor? ‘Old Cameron,’ you’ve said to yourself, ‘is a has-been, a drunken . . .’come on, you’ve said it! ... ‘a drunken failure who can’t be particular!’ Isthat it? ... Come on, answer me! Answer me, damn you! What are you staring at?Is that it? Go on! Deny it!”“It’s not necessary.”“Where have you worked before?”“I’m just beginning.”“What have you done?”“I’ve had three years at Stanton.”“Oh? The gentleman was too lazy to finish?”“I have been expelled.”“Great!” Cameron slapped the desk with his fist and laughed. “Splendid! You’renot good enough for the lice nest at Stanton, but you’ll work for Henry Cameron!You’ve decided this is the place for refuse! What did they kick you out for?Drink? Women? What?”“These,” said Roark, and extended his drawings.Cameron looked at the first one, then at the next, then at every one of them tothe bottom. Roark heard the paper rustling as Cameron slipped one sheet behindanother. Then Cameron raised his head.“Sit down.”Roark obeyed. Cameron stared at him, his thick fingers drumming against the pileof drawings.“So you think they’re good?” said Cameron. “Well, they’re awful. It’sunspeakable. It’s a crime. Look,” he shoved a drawing at Roark’s face, “look atthat. What in Christ’s name was your idea? What possessed you to indent thatplan here? Did you just want to make it pretty, because you had to patchsomething together? Who do you think you are? Guy Francon, God help you? ...Look at this building, you fool! You get an idea like this and you don’t knowwhat to do with it! You stumble on a magnificent thing and you have to ruin it!Do you know how much you’ve got to learn?”“Yes. That’s why I’m here.”“And look at that one! I wish I’d done that at your age! But why did you have tobotch it? Do you know what I’d do with that? Look, to hell with your stairwaysand to hell with your furnace room! When you lay the foundations . . .”He spoke furiously for a long time. He cursed. He did not find one sketch tosatisfy him. But Roark noticed that he spoke as of buildings that were inconstruction.He broke off abruptly, pushed the drawings aside, and put his fist over them. Heasked:“When did you decide to become an architect?”“When I was ten years old.”“Men don’t know what they want so early in life, if ever. You’re lying.”“Am I?”“Don’t stare at me like that! Can’t you look at something else? Why did youdecide to be an architect?”“I didn’t know it then. But it’s because I’ve never believed in God.”“Come on, talk sense.”“Because I love this earth. That’s all I love. I don’t like the shape of thingson this earth. I want to change them.”“For whom?”“For myself.”“How old are you?”“Twenty-two.”“When did you hear all that?”“I didn’t.”“Men don’t talk like that at twenty-two. You’re abnormal.”“Probably.”“I didn’t mean it as a compliment.”“I didn’t either.”“Got any family?”“No.”“Worked through school?”“Yes.”“At what?”“In the building trades.”“How much money have you got left?”“Seventeen dollars and thirty cents.”“When did you come to New York?”“Yesterday.”Cameron looked at the white pile under his fist.“God damn you,” said Cameron softly.“God damn you!” roared Cameron suddenly, leaning forward. “I didn’t ask you tocome here! I don’t need any draftsmen! There’s nothing here to draft! I don’thave enough work to keep myself and my men out of the Bowery Mission! I don’twant any fool visionaries starving around here! I don’t want the responsibility.I didn’t ask for it. I never thought I’d see it again. I’m through with it. Iwas through with that many years ago. I’m perfectly happy with the droolingdolts I’ve got here, who never had anything and never will have and it makes nodifference what becomes of them. That’s all I want. Why did you have to comehere? You’re setting out to ruin yourself, you know that, don’t you? And I’llhelp you to do it. I don’t want to see you. I don’t like you. I don’t like yourface. You look like an insufferable egotist. You’re impertinent. You’re too sureof yourself. Twenty years ago I’d have punched your face with the greatest ofpleasure. You’re coming to work here tomorrow at nine o’clock sharp.”“Yes,” said Roark, rising.“Fifteen dollars a week. That’s all I can pay you.”“Yes.”“You’re a damn fool. You should have gone to someone else. I’ll kill you if yougo to anyone else. What’s your name?”“Howard Roark.”“If you’re late, I’ll fire you.”“Yes.”Roark extended his hand for the drawings.“Leave these here!” bellowed Cameron. “Now get out!”EDITOR’S NOTE: The following excerpt (150 pages later) depicts the first meetingbetween Howard Roark and the lovely Dominique Francon—and its consequences.Dominique worships greatness, but believes that Roark is doomed in a world ruledby mediocrity.Roark, rejected by the world, has closed his practice to work in a granitequarry. The quarry happens to be owned by Dominique’s father, the architect GuyFrancon. Dominique is spending the summer alone in her father’s mansion a fewmiles from the quarry."},{"pageContent":"The Quarry SequenceBECAUSE THE sun was too hot that morning, and she knew it would be hotter at thegranite quarry, because she wanted to see no one and knew she would face a gangof workers, Dominique walked to the quarry. The thought of seeing it on thatblazing day was revolting; she enjoyed the prospect.When she came out of the woods to the edge of the great stone bowl, she felt asif she were thrust into an execution chamber filled with scalding steam. Theheat did not come from the sun, but from that broken cut in the earth, from thereflectors of flat ridges. Her shoulders, her head, her back, exposed to thesky, seemed cool while she felt the hot breath of the stone rising up her legs,to her chin, to her nostrils. The air shimmered below, sparks of fire shotthrough the granite; she thought the stone was stirring, melting, running inwhite trickles of lava. Drills and hammers cracked the still weight of the air.It was obscene to see men on the shelves of the furnace. They did not look likeworkers, they looked like a chain gang serving an unspeakable penance for someunspeakable crime. She could not turn away.She stood, as an insult to the place below. Her dress—the color of water, a palegreen-blue, too simple and expensive, its pleats exact like edges of glass—herthin heels planted wide apart on the boulders, the smooth helmet of her hair,the exaggerated fragility of her body against the sky—flaunted the fastidiouscoolness of the gardens and drawing rooms from which she came.She looked down. Her eyes stopped on the orange hair of a man who raised hishead and looked at her.She stood very still, because her first perception was not of sight, but oftouch: the consciousness, not of a visual presence, but of a slap in the face.She held one hand awkwardly away from her body, the fingers spread wide on theair, as against a wall. She knew that she could not move until he permitted herto.She saw his mouth and the silent contempt in the shape of his mouth; the planesof his gaunt, hollow cheeks; the cold, pure brilliance of the eyes that had notrace of pity. She knew it was the most beautiful face she would ever see,because it was the abstraction of strength made visible. She felt a convulsionof anger, of protest, of resistance—and of pleasure. He stood looking up at her;it was not a glance, but an act of ownership. She thought she must let her facegive him the answer he deserved. But she was looking, instead, at the stone duston his burned arms, the wet shirt clinging to his ribs, the lines of his longlegs. She was thinking of those statues of men she had always sought; she waswondering what he would look like naked. She saw him looking at her as if heknew that. She thought she had found an aim in life—a sudden, sweeping hatredfor that man.She was first to move. She turned and walked away from him. She saw thesuperintendent of the quarry on the path ahead, and she waved. Thesuperintendent rushed forward to meet her. “Why, Miss Francon!” he cried. “Why,how do you do, Miss Francon!”She hoped the words were heard by the man below. For the first time in her life,she was glad of being Miss Francon, glad of her father’s position andpossessions, which she had always despised. She thought suddenly that the manbelow was only a common worker, owned by the owner of this place, and she wasalmost the owner of this place.The superintendent stood before her respectfully. She smiled and said:“I suppose I’ll inherit the quarry some day, so I thought I should show someinterest in it once in a while.”The superintendent preceded her down the path, displayed his domain to her,explained the work. She followed him far to the other side of the quarry; shedescended to the dusty green dell of the work sheds; she inspected thebewildering machinery. She allowed a convincingly sufficient time to elapse.Then she walked back, alone, down the edge of the granite bowl.She saw him from a distance as she approached. He was working.She saw one strand of red hair that fell over his face and swayed with thetrembling of the drill. She thought—hopefully—that the vibrations of the drillhurt him, hurt his body, everything inside his body.When she was on the rocks above him, he raised his head and looked at her; shehad not caught him noticing her approach; he looked up as if he expected her tobe there, as if he knew she would be back. She saw the hint of a smile, moreinsulting than words. He sustained the insolence of looking straight at her, hewould not move, he would not grant the concession of turning away—ofacknowledging that he had no right to look at her in such manner. He had notmerely taken that right, he was saying silently that she had given it to him.She turned sharply and walked on, down the rocky slope, away from the quarry. It was not his eyes, not his mouth that she remembered, but his hands. Themeaning of that day seemed held in a single picture she had noted: the simpleinstant of his one hand resting against granite. She saw it again: hisfingertips pressed to the stone, his long fingers continuing the straight linesof the tendons that spread in a fan from his wrist to his knuckles. She thoughtof him, but the vision present through all her thoughts was the picture of thathand on the granite. It frightened her; she could not understand it.He’s only a common worker, she thought, a hired man doing a convict’s labor. Shethought of that, sitting before the glass shelf of her dressing table. Shelooked at the crystal objects spread before her; they were like sculptures inice-they proclaimed her own cold, luxurious fragility; and she thought of hisstrained body, of his clothes drenched in dust and sweat, of his hands. Shestressed the contrast, because it degraded her. She leaned back, closing hereyes. She thought of the many distinguished men whom she had refused. Shethought of the quarry worker. She thought of being broken—not by a man sheadmired, but by a man she loathed. She let her head fall down on her arm; thethought left her weak with pleasure.For two days she made herself believe that she would escape from this place; shefound old travel folders in her trunk, studied them, chose the resort, the hoteland the particular room in that hotel, selected the train she would take, theboat and the number of the state-room. She found a vicious amusement in doingthat, because she knew she would not take this trip she wanted; she would goback to the quarry.She went back to the quarry three days later. She stopped over the ledge wherehe worked and she stood watching him openly. When he raised his head, she didnot turn away. Her glance told him she knew the meaning of her action, but didnot respect him enough to conceal it. His glance told her only that he hadexpected her to come. He bent over his drill and went on with his work. Shewaited. She wanted him to look up. She knew that he knew it. He would not lookagain.She stood, watching his hands, waiting for the moments when he touched stone.She forgot the drill and the dynamite. She liked to think of the granite beingbroken by his hands.She heard the superintendent calling her name, hurrying to her up the path. Sheturned to him when he approached.“I like to watch the men working,” she explained.“Yes, quite a picture, isn’t it?” the superintendent agreed. “There’s the trainstarting over there with another load.”She was not watching the train. She saw the man below looking at her, she sawthe insolent hint of amusement tell her that he knew she did not want him tolook at her now. She turned her head away. The superintendent’s eyes traveledover the pit and stopped on the man below them.“Hey, you down there!” he shouted. “Are you paid to work or to gape?”The man bent silently over his drill. Dominique laughed aloud.The superintendent said: “It’s a tough crew we got down here, Miss Francon ...Some of ’em even with jail records.”“Has that man a jail record?” she asked, pointing down.“Well, I couldn’t say. Wouldn’t know them all by sight.”She hoped he had. She wondered whether they whipped convicts nowadays. She hopedthey did. At the thought of it, she felt a sinking gasp such as she had felt inchildhood, in dreams of falling down a long stairway; but she felt the sinkingin her stomach.She turned brusquely and left the quarry.She came back many days later. She saw him, unexpectedly, on a flat stretch ofstone before her, by the side of the path. She stopped short. She did not wantto come too close. It was strange to see him before her, without the defense andexcuse of distance.He stood looking straight at her. Their understanding was too offensivelyintimate, because they had never said a word to each other. She destroyed it byspeaking to him.“Why do you always stare at me?” she asked sharply.She thought with relief that words were the best means of estrangement. She haddenied everything they both knew by naming it. For a moment, he stood silently,looking at her. She felt terror at the thought that he would not answer, that hewould let his silence tell her too clearly why no answer was necessary. But heanswered. He said:“For the same reason you’ve been staring at me.”“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”“If you didn’t, you’d be much more astonished and much less angry, MissFrancon.”“So you know my name?”“You’ve been advertising it loudly enough.”“You’d better not be insolent. I can have you fired at a moment’s notice, youknow”He turned his head, looking for someone among the men below. He asked: “Shall Icall the superintendent?”She smiled contemptuously.“No, of course not. It would be too simple. But since you know who I am, itwould be better if you stopped looking at me when I come here. It might bemisunderstood.”“I don’t think so.”She turned away. She had to control her voice. She looked over the stone ledges.She asked: “Do you find it very hard to work here?”“Yes. Terribly.”“Do you get tired?”“Inhumanly.”“How does that feel?”“I can hardly walk when the day’s ended. I can’t move my arms at night. When Ilie in bed, I can count every muscle in my body to the number of separate,different pains.”She knew suddenly that he was not telling her about himself; he was speaking ofher, he was saying the things she wanted to hear and telling her that he knewwhy she wanted to hear these particular sentences.She felt anger, a satisfying anger because it was cold and certain. She feltalso a desire to let her skin touch his; to let the length of her bare arm pressagainst the length of his; just that; the desire went no further.She was asking calmly:“You don’t belong here, do you? You don’t talk like a worker. What were youbefore?”“An electrician. A plumber. A plasterer. Many things.”“Why are you working here?”“For the money you’re paying me, Miss Francon.”She shrugged. She turned and walked away from him up the path. She knew that hewas looking after her. She did not glance back. She continued on her way throughthe quarry, and she left it as soon as she could, but she did not go back downthe path where she would have to see him again.005 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_005_r1.jpg]DOMINIQUE awakened each morning to the prospect of a day made significant by theexistence of a goal to be reached: the goal of making it a day on which shewould not go to the quarry.She had lost the freedom she loved. She knew that a continuous struggle againstthe compulsion of a single desire was compulsion also, but it was the form shepreferred to accept. It was the only manner in which she could let him motivateher life. She found a dark satisfaction in pain—because that pain came from him.She went to call on her distant neighbors, a wealthy, gracious family who hadbored her in New York; she had visited no one all summer. They were astonishedand delighted to see her. She sat among a group of distinguished people at theedge of a swimming pool. She watched the air of fastidious elegance around her.She watched the deference of these people’s manner when they spoke to her. Sheglanced at her own reflection in the pool: she looked more delicately austerethan any among them.And she thought, with a vicious thrill,_of what these people would do if theyread her mind in this moment; if they knew that she was thinking of a man in aquarry, thinking of his body with a sharp intimacy as one does not think ofanother’s body but only of one’s own. She smiled; the cold purity of her faceprevented them from seeing the nature of that smile. She came back again tovisit these people—for the same of such thoughts in the presence of theirrespect for her.One evening, a guest offered to drive her back to her house. He was an eminentyoung poet. He was pale and slender; he had a soft, sensitive mouth, and eyeshurt by the whole universe. She had not noticed the wistful attention with whichhe had watched her for a long time. As they drove through the twilight she sawhim leaning hesitantly closer to her. She heard his voice whispering thepleading, incoherent things she had heard from many men. He stopped the car. Shefelt his lips pressed to her shoulder.She jerked away from him. She sat still for an instant, because she would haveto brush against him if she moved and she could not bear to touch him. Then sheflung the door open, she leaped out, she slammed the door behind her as if thecrash of sound could wipe him out of existence, and she ran blindly. She stoppedrunning after a while, and she walked on shivering, walked down the dark roaduntil she saw the roof line of her own house.She stopped, looking about her with her first coherent thought of astonishment.Such incidents had happened to her often in the past; only then she had beenamused; she had felt no revulsion; she had felt nothing.She walked slowly across the lawn, to the house. On the stairs to her room shestopped. She thought of the man in the quarry. She thought, in clear, formedwords, that the man in the quarry wanted her. She had known it before; she hadknown it with his first glance at her. But she had never stated the knowledge toherself.She laughed. She looked about her, at the silent splendor of her house. Thehouse made the words preposterous. She knew that would never happen to her. Andshe knew the kind of suffering she could impose on him.For days she walked with satisfaction through the rooms of her house. It was herdefense. She heard the explosions of blasting from the quarry and smiled.But she felt too certain and the house was too safe. She felt a desire tounderscore the safety by challenging it.She chose the marble slab in front of the fireplace in her bedroom. She wantedit broken. She knelt, hammer in hand, and tried to smash the marble. She poundedit, her thin arm sweeping high over her head, crashing down with ferocioushelplessness. She felt the pain in the bones of her arms, in her shouldersockets. She succeeded in making a long scratch across the marble.She went to the quarry. She saw him from a distance and walked straight to him.“Hello,” she said casually.He stopped the drill. He leaned against a stone shelf. He answered:“Hello.”“I have been thinking of you,” she said softly, and stopped, then added, hervoice flowing on in the same tone of compelling invitation, “because there’s abit of a dirty job to be done at my house. Would you like to make some extramoney?”“Certainly, Miss Francon.”“Will you come to my house tonight? The way to the servants’ entrance is offRidgewood Road. There’s a marble piece at a fireplace that’s broken and has tobe replaced. I want you to take it out and order a new one made for me.”She expected anger and refusal. He asked:“What time shall I come?”“At seven o’clock. What are you paid here?”“Sixty-two cents an hour.”“I’m sure you’re worth that. I’m quite willing to pay you at the same rate. Doyou know how to find my house?”“No, Miss Francon.”“Just ask anyone in the village to direct you.”“Yes, Miss Francon.”She walked away, disappointed. She felt that their secret understanding waslost; he had spoken as if it were a simple job which she could have offered toany other workman. Then she felt the sinking gasp inside, that feeling of shameand pleasure which he always gave her: she realized that their understanding hadbeen more intimate and flagrant than ever—in his natural acceptance of anunnatural offer; he had shown her how much he knew—by his lack of astonishment.She asked her old caretaker and his wife to remain in the house that evening.Their diffident presence completed the picture of a feudal mansion. She heardthe bell of the servants’ entrance at seven o’clock. The old woman escorted himto the great front hall where Dominique stood on the landing of a broadstairway.She watched him approaching, looking up at her. She held the pose long enough tolet him suspect that it was a deliberate pose deliberately planned; she broke itat the exact moment before he could become certain of it. She said: “Goodevening.” Her voice was austerely quiet.He did not answer, but inclined his head and walked on up the stairs toward her.He wore his work clothes and he carried a bag of tools. His movements had aswift, relaxed kind of energy that did not belong here, in her house, on thepolished steps, between the delicate, rigid banisters. She had expected him toseem incongruous in her house; but it was the house that seemed incongruousaround him.She moved one hand, indicating the door of her bedroom. He followed obediently.He did not seem to notice the room when he entered. He entered it as if it werea workshop. He walked straight to the fireplace.“There it is,” she said, one finger pointing to the marble slab.He said nothing. He knelt, took a thin metal wedge from his bag, held its pointagainst the scratch on the slab, took a hammer and struck one blow. The marblesplit in a long, deep cut.He glanced up at her. It was the look she dreaded, a look of laughter that couldnot be answered, because the laughter could not be seen, only felt. He said:“Now it’s broken and has to be replaced.”She asked calmly:“Would you know what kind of marble this is and where to order another piecelike it?”“Yes, Miss Francon.”“Go ahead, then. Take it out.”“Yes, Miss Francon.”She stood watching him. It was strange to feel a senseless necessity to watchthe mechanical process of the work as if her eyes were helping it. Then she knewthat she was afraid to look at the room around them. She made herself raise herhead.She saw the shelf of her dressing table, its glass edge like a narrow greensatin ribbon in the semidarkness, and the crystal containers; she saw a pair ofwhite bedroom slippers, a pale blue towel on the floor by a mirror, a pair ofstockings thrown over the arm of a chair; she saw the white satin cover of herbed. His shirt had damp stains and gray patches of stone dust; the dust madestreaks on the skin of his arms. She felt as if each object in the room had beentouched by him, as if the air were a heavy pool of water into which they hadbeen plunged together, and the water that touched him carried the touch to her,to every object in the room. She wanted him to look up. He worked, withoutraising his head.She approached him and stood silently over him. She had never stood so close tohim before. She looked down at the smooth skin on the back of his neck; shecould distinguish single threads of his hair. She glanced down at the tip of hersandal. It was there, on the floor, an inch away from his body; she needed butone movement, a very slight movement of her foot, to touch him. She made a stepback.He moved his head, but not to look up, only to pick another tool from the bag,and bent over his work again.She laughed aloud. He stopped and glanced at her.“Yes?” he asked.Her face was grave, her voice gentle when she answered:“Oh, I’m sorry. You might have thought that I was laughing at you. But I wasn’t,of course.”She added:“I didn’t want to disturb you. I’m sure you’re anxious to finish and get out ofhere. I mean, of course, because you must be tired. But then, on the other hand,I’m paying you by the hour, so it’s quite all right if you stretch your time alittle, if you want to make more out of it. There must be things you’d like totalk about.”“Oh, yes, Miss Francon.”“Well?”“I think this is an atrocious fireplace.”“Really? This house was designed by my father.”“Yes, of course, Miss Francon.”“There’s no point in your discussing the work of an architect.”“None at all.”“Surely we could choose some other subject.”“Yes, Miss Francon.”She moved away from him. She sat down on the bed, leaning back on straight arms,her legs crossed and pressed close together in a long, straight line. Her body,sagging limply from her shoulders, contradicted the inflexible precision of thelegs; the cold austerity of her face contradicted the pose of her body.He glanced at her occasionally, as he worked. He was speaking obediently. He wassaying:“I shall make certain to get a piece of marble of precisely the same quality,Miss Francon. It is very important to distinguish between the various kinds ofmarble. Generally speaking, there are three kinds. The white marbles, which arederived from the recrystallization of limestone, the onyx marbles which arechemical deposits of calcium carbonate, and the green marbles which consistmainly of hydrous magnesium silicate or serpentine. This last must not beconsidered as true marble. True marble is a metamorphic form of limestone,produced by heat and pressure. Pressure is a powerful factor. It leads toconsequences which, once started, cannot be controlled.”“What consequences?” she asked, leaning forward.“The recrystallization of the particles of limestone and the infiltration offoreign elements from the surrounding soil. These constitute the colored streakswhich are to be found in most marbles. Pink marble is caused by the presence ofmanganese oxides, gray marble is due to carbonaceous matter, yellow marble isattributed to a hydrous oxide of iron. This piece here is, of course, whitemarble. There are a great many varieties of white marble. You should be verycareful, Miss Francon ...”She sat leaning forward, gathered into a dim black huddle; the lamp light fellon one hand she had dropped limply on her knees, palm up, the fingershalf-closed, a thin edge of fire outlining each finger, the dark cloth of herdress making the hand too naked and brilliant.“... to make certain that I order a new piece of precisely the same quality. Itwould not be advisable, for instance, to substitute a piece of white Georgiamarble which is not as fine-grained as the white marble of Alabama. This isAlabama marble. Very high grade. Very expensive.”He saw her hand close and drop down, out of the light. He continued his work insilence.When he had finished, he rose, asking:“Where shall I put the stone?”“Leave it there. I’ll have it removed.”“I’ll order a new piece cut to measure and delivered to you C.O.D. Do you wishme to set it?”“Yes, certainly. I’ll let you know when it comes. How much do I owe you?” Sheglanced at a clock on her bedside table. “Let me see, you’ve been here threequarters of an hour. That’s forty-eight cents.” She reached for her bag, shetook out the dollar bill, she handed it to him. “Keep the change,” she said.She hoped he would throw it back in her face. He slipped the bill into hispocket. He said:“Thank you, Miss Francon.”He saw the edge of her long black sleeve trembling over her closed fingers.“Good night,” she said, her voice hollow in anger.He bowed: “Good night, Miss Francon.”He turned and walked down the stairs, out of the house.006 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_006_r1.jpg]She stopped thinking of him. She thought of the piece of marble he had ordered.She waited for it to come, with the feverish intensity of a sudden mania; shecounted the days; she watched the rare trucks on the road beyond the lawn.She told herself fiercely that she merely wanted the marble to come; just that;nothing else, no hidden reasons; no reasons at all. It was a last, hystericalaftermath; she was free of everything else. The stone would come and that wouldbe the end.When the stone came, she barely glanced at it. The delivery truck had not leftthe grounds, when she was at her desk, writing a note on a piece of exquisitestationery. She wrote: “The marble is here. I want it set tonight.” She sent her caretaker with the note to the quarry. She ordered it delivered to:“I don’t know his name. The redheaded workman who was here.”The caretaker came back and brought her a scrap torn from a brown paper bag,bearing in pencil: “You’ll have it set tonight.” She waited, in the suffocating emptiness of impatience, at the window of herbedroom. The servants’ entrance bell rang at seven o’clock. There was a knock ather door. “Come in,” she snapped—to hide the strange sound of her own voice. Thedoor opened and the caretaker’s wife entered, motioning for someone to follow.The person who followed was a short, squat, middle-aged Italian with bow legs, agold hoop in one ear and a frayed hat held respectfully in both hands.“The man sent from the quarry, Miss Francon,” said the caretaker’s wife.Dominique asked, her voice not a scream and not a question:“Who are you?”“Pasquale Orsini,” the man answered obediently, bewildered.“What do you want?”“Well, I ... Well, Red down at the quarry said fireplace gotta be fixed, he saidyou wanta I fix her.”“Yes. Yes, of course,” she said, rising. “I forgot. Go ahead.”She had to get out of the room. She had to run, not to be seen by anyone, not tobe seen by herself if she could escape it.She stopped somewhere in the garden and stood trembling, pressing her fistsagainst her eyes. It was anger. It was a pure, single emotion that swepteverything clean; everything but the terror under the anger; terror, because sheknew that she could not go near the quarry now and that she would go.It was early evening, many days later, when she went to the quarry. She returnedon horseback from a long ride through the country, and she saw the shadowslengthening on the lawn; she knew that she could not live through another night.She had to get there before the workers left. She wheeled about. She rode to thequarry, flying, the wind cutting her cheeks.He was not there when she reached the quarry. She knew at once that he was notthere, even though the workers were just leaving and a great many of them werefiling down the paths from the stone bowl. She stood, her lips tight, and shelooked for him. But she knew that he had left.She rode into the woods. She flew at random between walls of leaves that meltedahead in the gathering twilight. She stopped, broke a long, thin branch off atree, tore the leaves off, and went on, using the flexible stick as a whip,lashing her horse to fly faster. She felt as if the speed would hasten theevening on, force the hours ahead to pass more quickly, let her leap across timeto catch the coming morning before it came. And then she saw him walking aloneon the path before her.She tore ahead. She caught up with him and stopped sharply, the jolt throwingher forward then back like the release of a spring. He stopped.They said nothing. They looked at each other. She thought that every silentinstant passing was a betrayal; this wordless encounter was too eloquent, thisrecognition that no greeting was necessary.She asked, her voice flat:“Why didn’t you come to set the marble?”“I didn’t think it would make any difference to you who came. Or did it, MissFrancon?”She felt the words not as sounds, but as a blow flat against her mouth. Thebranch she held went up and slashed across his face. She started off in thesweep of the same motion.007 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_007_r1.jpg]Dominique sat at the dressing table in her bedroom. It was very late. There wasno sound in the vast, empty house around her. The french windows of the bedroomwere open on a terrace and there was no sound of leaves in the dark gardenbeyond.The blankets on her bed were turned down, waiting for her, the pillow whiteagainst the tall, black windows. She thought she would try to sleep. She had notseen him for three days. She ran her hands over her head, the curves of herpalms pressing against the smooth planes of hair. She pressed her fingertips,wet with perfume, to the hollows of her temples, and held them there for amoment; she felt relief in the cold, contracting bite of the liquid on her skin.A spilled drop of perfume remained on the glass of the dressing table, a dropsparkling like a gem and as expensive.She did not hear the sound of steps in the garden. She heard them only when theyrose up the stairs to the terrace. She sat up, frowning. She looked at thefrench windows.He came in. He wore his work clothes, the dirty shirt with rolled sleeves, thetrousers smeared with stone dust. He stood looking at her. There was no laughingunderstanding in his face. His face was drawn, austere in cruelty, ascetic inpassion, the cheeks sunken, the lips pulled down, set tight. She jumped to herfeet, she stood, her arms thrown back, her fingers spread apart. He did notmove. She saw a vein of his neck rise, beating, and fall down again.Then he walked to her. He held her as if his flesh had cut through hers and shefelt the bones of his arms on the bones of her ribs, her legs jerked tightagainst his, his mouth on hers.She did not know whether the jolt of terror shook her first and she thrust herelbows at his throat, twisting her body to escape, or whether she lay still inhis arms, in the first instant, in the shock of feeling his skin against hers,the thing she had thought about, had expected, had never known to be like this,could not have known, because this was not part of living, but a thing one couldnot bear longer than a second.She tried to tear herself away from him. The effort broke against his arms thathad not felt it. Her fists beat against his shoulders, against his face. Hemoved one hand, took her two wrists, pinned them behind her, under his arm,wrenching her shoulder blades. She twisted her head back. She felt his lips onher breast. She tore herself free.She fell back against the dressing table, she stood crouching, her handsclasping the edge behind her, her eyes wide, colorless, shapeless in terror. Hewas laughing. There was the movement of laughter on his face, but no sound.Perhaps he had released her intentionally. He stood, his legs apart, his armshanging at his sides, letting her be more sharply aware of his body across thespace between them than she had been in his arms. She looked at the door behindhim, he saw the first hint of movement, no more than a thought of leaping towardthat door. He extended his arm, not touching her, and fell back. Her shouldersmoved faintly, rising. He took a step forward and her shoulders fell. Shehuddled lower, closer to the table. He let her wait. Then he approached. Helifted her without effort. She let her teeth sink into his hand and felt bloodon the tip of her tongue. He pulled her head back and he forced her mouth openagainst his.She fought like an animal. But she made no sound. She did not call for help. Sheheard the echoes of her blows in a gasp of his breath, and she knew that it wasa gasp of pleasure. She reached for the lamp on the dressing table. He knockedthe lamp out of her hand. The crystal burst to pieces in the darkness.He had thrown her down on the bed and she felt the blood beating in her throat,in her eyes, the hatred, the helpless terror in her blood. She felt the hatredand his hands; his hands moving over her body, the hands that broke granite. Shefought in a last convulsion. Then the sudden pain shot up, through her body, toher throat, and she screamed. Then she lay still.It was an act that could be performed in tenderness, as a seal of love, or incontempt, as a symbol of humiliation and conquest. It could be the act of alover or the act of a soldier violating an enemy woman. He did it as an act ofscorn. Not as love, but as defilement. And this made her lie still and submit.One gesture of tenderness from him—and she would have remained cold, untouchedby the thing done to her body. But the act of a master taking shameful,contemptuous possession of her was the kind of rapture she had wanted. Then shefelt him shaking with the agony of a pleasure unbearable even to him, she knewthat she had given that to him, that it came from her, from her body, and shebit her lips and she knew what he had wanted her to know.He lay still across the bed, away from her, his head hanging back over the edge.She heard the slow, ending gasps of his breath. She lay on her back, as he hadleft her, not moving, her mouth open. She felt empty, light and flat.She saw him get up. She saw his silhouette against the window. He went out,without a word or a glance at her. She noticed that, but it did not matter. Shelistened blankly to the sound of his steps moving away in the garden.She lay still for a long time. Then she moved her tongue in her open mouth. Sheheard a sound that came from somewhere within her, and it was the dry, short,sickening sound of a sob, but she was not crying, her eyes were held paralyzed,dry and open. The sound became motion, a jolt running down her throat to herstomach. It flung her up, she stood awkwardly, bent over, her forearms pressedto her stomach. She heard the small table by the bed rattling in the darkness,and she looked at it, in empty astonishment that a table should move withoutreason. Then she understood that she was shaking. She was not frightened; itseemed foolish to shake like that, in short, separate jerks, like soundlesshiccoughs. She thought she must take a bath. The need was unbearable, as if shehad felt it for a long time. Nothing mattered, if only she would take a bath.She dragged her feet slowly to the door of her bathroom.She turned the light on in the bathroom. She saw herself in a tall mirror. Shesaw the purple bruises left on her body by his mouth. She heard a moan muffledin her throat, not very loud. It was not the sight, but the sudden flash ofknowledge. She knew that she would not take a bath. She knew that she wanted tokeep the feeling of his body, the traces of his body on hers, knowing also whatsuch a desire implied. She fell on her knees, clasping the edge of the bathtub.She could not make herself crawl over that edge. Her hands slipped, she laystill on the floor. The tiles were hard and cold under her body. She lay theretill morning.008 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_008_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: In this section, Roark is on trial—having been sued by HoptonStoddard, a client who had hired him to build a “Temple of the Human Spirit.”Everyone considers the Temple blasphemous.Ellsworth Toohey—critic, “humanitarian,” archenemy of Roark—foreseeing thatRoark’s revolutionary manner of building would antagonize people, hadmanipulated Stoddard into giving the commission to Roark and then into suinghim.In the newspaper column “Sacrilege,” which instigated the lawsuit, Toohey hadwritten: “Instead of being austerely enclosed, this alleged temple is wide open,like a western saloon [...] Man’s proper posture in a house of God is on hisknees. Nobody in his right mind would kneel within Mr. Roark’s temple. The placeforbids it. The emotions it suggests are of a different nature: arrogance,audacity, defiance, self-exaltation. It is not a house of God, but the cell of amegalomaniac.”"},{"pageContent":"The Stoddard TrialTHE CASE of Hopton Stoddard versus Howard Roark opened in February of 1931.The courtroom was so full that mass reactions could be expressed only by a slowmotion running across the spread of heads, a sluggish wave like the ripple underthe tight-packed skin of a sea lion.The crowd, brown and streaked with subdued color, looked like a fruitcake of allthe arts, with the cream of the A.G.A. rich and heavy on top. There weredistinguished men and well-dressed, tight-lipped women; each woman seemed tofeel an exclusive proprietorship of the art practiced by her escort, a monopolyguarded by resentful glances at the others. Almost everybody knew almosteverybody else. The room had the atmosphere of a convention, an opening nightand a family picnic. There was a feeling of “our bunch,” “our boys,” “our show.”[...]Beyond the windows the sky was white and flat like frosted glass. The lightseemed to come from the banks of snow on roofs and ledges, an unnatural lightthat made everything in the room look naked.The judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he were roosting. He had a smallface, wizened into virtue. He kept his hands upright in front of his chest, thefingertips pressed together. Hopton Stoddard was not present. He was representedby his attorney, a handsome gentleman, tall and grave as an ambassador.Roark sat alone at the defense table. The crowd had stared at him and given upangrily, finding no satisfaction. He did not look crushed and he did not lookdefiant. He looked impersonal and calm. He was not like a public figure in apublic place; he was like a man alone in his own room, listening to the radio.He took no notes; there were no papers on the table before him, only a largebrown envelope. The crowd would have forgiven anything, except a man who couldremain normal under the vibrations of its enormous collective sneer. Some ofthem had come prepared to pity him; all of them hated him after the first fewminutes.The plaintiff’s attorney stated his case in a simple opening address; it wastrue, he admitted, that Hopton Stoddard had given Roark full freedom to designand build the Temple; the point was, however, that Mr. Stoddard had clearlyspecified and expected a temple; the building in question could not beconsidered a temple by any known standards; as the plaintiff proposed to provewith the help of the best authorities in the field.Roark waived his privilege to make an opening statement to the jury.Ellsworth Monkton Toohey was the first witness called by the plaintiff. He saton the edge of the witness chair and leaned back, resting on the end of hisspine: he lifted one leg and placed it horizontally across the other. He lookedamused—but managed to suggest that his amusement was a well-bred protectionagainst looking bored.The attorney went through a long list of questions about Mr. Toohey’sprofessional qualifications, including the number of copies sold of his bookSermons in Stone. Then he read aloud Toohey’s column “Sacrilege” and asked himto state whether he had written it. Toohey replied that he had. There followed alist of questions in erudite terms on the architectural merits of the Temple.Toohey proved that it had none. There followed an historical review. Toohey,speaking easily and casually, gave a brief sketch of all known civilizations andof their outstanding religious monuments—from the Incas to the Phoenicians tothe Easter Islanders—including, whenever possible, the dates when thesemonuments were begun and the dates when they were completed, the number ofworkers employed in the construction and the approximate cost in modern Americandollars. The audience listened punch-drunk.Toohey proved that the Stoddard Temple contradicted every brick, stone andprecept of history. “I have endeavored to show,” he said in conclusion, “thatthe two essentials of the conception of a temple are a sense of awe and a senseof man’s humility. We have noted the gigantic proportions of religious edifices,the soaring lines, the horrible grotesques of monster-like gods, or, later,gargoyles. All of it tends to impress upon man his essential insignificance, tocrush him by sheer magnitude, to imbue him with that sacred terror which leadsto the meekness of virtue. The Stoddard Temple is a brazen denial of our entirepast, an insolent ‘No’ flung in the face of history. I may venture a guess as tothe reason why this case has aroused such public interest. All of us haverecognized instinctively that it involves a moral issue much.beyond its legalaspects. This building is a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. It is oneman’s ego,defying the most sacred impulses of all mankind, of every man on thestreet, of every man in this courtroom!”This was not a witness in court, but Ellsworth Toohey addressing a meeting—andthe reaction was inevitable: the audience burst into applause. The judge struckhis gavel and made a threat to have the courtroom cleared. Order was restored,but not to the faces of the crowd: the faces remained lecherouslyself-righteous. It was pleasant to be singled out and brought into the case asan injured party. Three-fourths of them had never seen the Stoddard Temple.“Thank you, Mr. Toohey,” said the attorney, faintly suggesting a bow. Then heturned to Roark and said with delicate courtesy: “Your witness.”“No questions,” said Roark.Ellsworth Toohey raised one eyebrow and left the stand regretfully.“Mr. Peter Keating!” called the attorney.Peter Keating’s face looked attractive and fresh, as if he had had a goodnight’s sleep. He mounted the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto,swinging his shoulders and arms unnecessarily. He took the oath and answered thefirst questions gaily. His pose in the witness chair was strange: his torsoslumped to one side with swaggering ease, an elbow on the chair’s arm; but hisfeet were planted awkwardly straight, and his knees were pressed tight together.He never looked at Roark. [...]“Now, Mr. Keating, you attended the Stanton Institute of Technology at the sameperiod as Mr. Roark?”“Yes.”“What can you tell us about Mr. Roark’s record there?”“He was expelled.”“He was expelled because he was unable to live up to the Institute’s highstandard of requirements?”“Yes. Yes, that was it.”The judge glanced at Roark. A lawyer would have objected to this testimony asirrelevant. Roark made no objection.“At that time, did you think that he showed any talent for the profession ofarchitecture?”“No.”“Will you please speak a little louder, Mr. Keating?”“I didn’t ... think he had any talent.”Queer things were happening to Keating’s verbal punctuation: some words came outcrisply, as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together,as if he would not stop to let himself hear them. He did not look at theattorney. He kept his eyes on the audience. At times, he looked like a boy outon a lark, a boy who has just drawn a mustache on the face of a beautiful girlon a subway toothpaste ad. Then he looked as if he were begging the crowd forsupport—as if he were on trial before them.“At one time you employed Mr. Roark in your office?”“Yes.”“And you found yourself forced to fire him?”“Yes ... we did.”“For incompetence?”“Yes.”“What can you tell us about Mr. Roark’s subsequent career?”“Well, you know, ‘career’ is a relative term. In volume of achievement anydraftsman in our office has done more than Mr. Roark. We don’t call one or twobuildings a career. We put up that many every month or so.”“Will you give us your professional opinion of his work?”“Well, I think it’s immature. Very startling, even quite interesting at times,but essentially—adolescent.”“Then Mr. Roark cannot be called a full-fledged architect?”“Not in the sense in which we speak of Mr. Ralston Holcombe, Mr. Guy Francon,Mr. Gordon Prescott—no. But, of course, I want to be fair. I think Mr. Roark haddefinite potentialities, particularly in problems of pure engineering. He couldhave made something of himself. I’ve tried to talk to him about it—I’ve tried tohelp him—I honestly did. But it was like talking to one of his pet pieces ofreinforced concrete. I knew that he’d come to something like this. I wasn’tsurprised when I heard that a client had had to sue him at last.”“What can you tell us about Mr. Roark’s attitude toward clients?”“Well, that’s the point. That’s the whole point. He didn’t care what the clientsthought or wished, what anyone in the world thought or wished. He didn’t evenunderstand how other architects could care. He wouldn’t even give you that, noteven understanding, not even enough to ... respect you a little just the same. Idon’t see what’s so wrong with trying to please people. I don’t see what’s wrongwith wanting to be friendly and liked and popular. Why is that a crime? Whyshould anyone sneer at you for that, sneer all the time, all the time, day andnight, not giving you a moment’s peace, like the Chinese water torture, you knowwhere they drop water on your skull drop by drop?”People in the audience began to realize that Peter Keating was drunk. Theattorney frowned; the testimony had been rehearsed; but it was getting off therails.“Well, now, Mr. Keating, perhaps you’d better tell us about Mr. Roark’s views onarchitecture.”“I’ll tell you, if you want to know. He thinks you should take your shoes offand kneel, when you speak of architecture. That’s what he thinks. Now why shouldyou? Why? It’s a business like any other, isn’t it? What’s so damn sacred aboutit? Why do we have to be all keyed up? We’re only human. We want to make aliving. Why can’t things be simple and easy? Why do we have to be some sort ofGod-damn heroes?”“Now, now, Mr. Keating, I think we’re straying slightly from the subject. We’re...”“No, we’re not. I know what I’m talking about. You do, too. They all do. Everyone of them here. I’m talking about the Temple. Don’t you see? Why pick a fiendto build a temple? Only a very human sort of man should be chosen to do that. Aman who understands ... and forgives. A man who forgives ... That’s what you goto church for—to be ... forgiven ...”“Yes, Mr. Keating, but speaking of Mr. Roark ...”“Well, what about Mr. Roark? He’s no architect. He’s no good. Why should I beafraid to say that he’s no good? Why are you all afraid of him?”“Mr. Keating, if you’re not well and wish to be dismissed ... ?”Keating looked at him, as if awakening. He tried to control himself. After awhile he said, his voice flat, resigned:“No. I’m all right. I’ll tell you anything you want. What is it you want me tosay?”“Will you tell us—in professional terms—your opinion of the structure known asthe Stoddard Temple?”“Yes. Sure. The Stoddard Temple ... The Stoddard Temple has an improperlyarticulated plan, which leads to spatial confusion. There is no balance ofmasses. It lacks a sense of symmetry. Its proportions are inept.” He spoke in amonotone. His neck was stiff; he was making an effort not to let it dropforward. “It’s out of scale. It contradicts the elementary principles ofcomposition. The total effect is that of ...”“Louder please, Mr. Keating.”“The total effect is that of crudeness and architectural illiteracy. It shows... it shows no sense of structure, no instinct for beauty, no creativeimagination, no ...” he closed his eves, “... artistic integrity ...”“Thank you, Mr. Keating. That is all.”The attorney turned to Roark and said nervously:“Your witness.”“No questions,” said Roark.This concluded the first day of the trial. [...]In the next two days a succession of witnesses testified for the plaintiff.Every examination began with questions that brought out the professionalachievements of the witness. The attorney gave them leads like an expert pressagent. Austen Heller remarked that architects must have fought for the privilegeof being called to the witness stand, since it was the grandest spree ofpublicity in a usually silent profession.None of the witnesses looked at Roark. He looked at them. He listened to thetestimony. He said: “No questions,” to each one.Ralston Holcombe on the stand, with flowing tie and gold-headed cane, had theappearance of a Grand Duke or a beer-garden composer. His testimony was long andscholarly, but it came down to:“It’s all nonsense. It’s all a lot of childish nonsense. I can’t say that I feelmuch sympathy for Mr. Hopton Stoddard. He should have known better. It is ascientific fact that the architectural style of the Renaissance is the only oneappropriate to our age. If our best people, like Mr. Stoddard, refuse torecognize this, what can you expect from all sorts of parvenus, would-bearchitects and the rabble in general? It has been proved that Renaissance is theonly permissible style for all churches, temples and cathedrals. What about SirChristopher Wren? Just laugh that off. And remember the greatest religiousmonument of all time—St. Peter’s in Rome. Are you going to improve upon St.Peter’s? And if Mr. Stoddard did not specifically insist on Renaissance, he gotjust exactly what he deserved. It serves him jolly well right.”Gordon L. Prescott wore a turtle-neck sweater under a plaid coat, tweed trousersand heavy golf shoes.“The correlation of the transcendental to the purely spatial in the buildingunder discussion is entirely screwy,” he said. “If we take the horizontal as theone-dimensional, the vertical as the two-dimensional, the diagonal as thethree-dimensional, and the interpenetration of spaces as thefourth-dimensional-architecture being a fourth-dimensional art—we can see quitesimply that this building is homa-loidal, or—in the language of the layman—flat.The flowing life which comes from the sense of order in chaos, or, if youprefer, from unity in diversity, as well as vice versa, which is the realizationof the contradiction inherent in architecture, is here absolutely absent. I amreally trying to express myself as clearly as I can, but it is impossible topresent a dialectic state by covering it up with an old fig leaf of logic justfor the sake of the mentally lazy layman.”John Erik Snyte testified modestly and unobtrusively that he had employed Roarkin his office, that Roark had been an unreliable, disloyal and unscrupulousemployee, and that Roark had started his career by stealing a client from him.On the fourth day of the trial the plaintiff’s attorney called his last witness.“Miss Dominique Francon,” he announced solemnly. [...]The attorney had reserved Dominique for his climax, partly because he expected agreat deal from her, and partly because he was worried; she was the onlyunrehearsed witness; she had refused to be coached. She had never mentioned theStoddard Temple in her column ; but he had looked up her earlier writings onRoark; and Ellsworth Toohey had advised him to call her.Dominique stood for a moment on the elevation of the witness stand, lookingslowly over the crowd. Her beauty was startling but too impersonal, as if it didnot belong to her; it seemed present in the room as a separate entity. Peoplethought of a vision that had not quite appeared, of a victim on a scaffold, of aperson standing at night at the rail of an ocean liner.“What is your name?”“Dominique Francon.”“And your occupation, Miss Francon?”“Newspaper woman.”“You are the author of the brilliant column ‘Your House’ appearing in the NewYork Banner?”“I am the author of ‘Your House.’ ”“Your father is Guy Francon, the eminent architect?”“Yes. My father was asked to come here to testify. He refused. He said he didnot care for a building such as the Stoddard Temple, but he did not think thatwe were behaving like gentlemen.”“Well, now, Miss Francon, shall we confine our answers to our questions? We areindeed fortunate to have you with us, since you are our only woman witness, andwomen have always had the purest sense of religious faith. Being, in addition,an outstanding authority on architecture, you are eminently qualified to give uswhat I shall call, with all deference, the feminine angle on this case. Will youtell us in your own words what you think of the Stoddard Temple?”“I think that Mr. Stoddard has made a mistake. There would have been no doubtabout the justice of his case if he had sued, not for alteration costs, but fordemolition costs.”The attorney looked relieved. “Will you explain your reasons, Miss Francon?”“You have heard them from every witness at this trial.”“Then I take it that you agree with the preceding testimony?”“Completely. Even more completely than the persons who testified. They were veryconvincing witnesses.”“Will you ... clarify that, Miss Francon? Just what do you mean?”“What Mr. Toohey said: that this temple is a threat to all of us.”“Oh, I see.”“Mr. Toohey understood the issue so well. Shall I clarify it—in my own words?”“By all means.”“Howard Roark built a temple to the human spirit. He saw man as strong, proud,clean, wise and fearless. He saw man as a heroic being. And he built a temple tothat. A temple is a place where man is to experience exaltation. He thought thatexaltation comes from the consciousness of being guiltless, of seeing the truthand achieving it, of living up to one’s highest possibility, of knowing no shameand having no cause for shame, of being able to stand naked in full sunlight. Hethought that exaltation means joy and that joy is man’s birthright. He thoughtthat a place built as a setting for man is a sacred place. That is what HowardRoark thought of man and of exaltation. But Ellsworth Toohey said that thistemple was a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. Ellsworth Toohey saidthat the essence of exaltation was to be scared out of your wits, to fall downand to grovel. Ellsworth Toohey said that man’s highest act was to realize hisown worthlessness and to beg forgiveness. Ellsworth Toohey said it was depravednot to take for granted that man is something which needs to be forgiven.Ellsworth Toohey saw that this building was of man and of the earth—andEllsworth Toohey said that this building had its belly in the mud. To glorifyman, said Ellsworth Toohey, was to glorify the gross pleasure of the flesh, forthe realm of the spirit is beyond the grasp of man. To enter that realm, saidEllsworth Toohey, man must come as a beggar, on his knees. Ellsworth Toohey is alover of mankind.”“Miss Francon, we are not really discussing Mr. Toohey, so if you will confineyourself to ...”“I do not condemn Ellsworth Toohey. I condemn Howard Roark. A building, theysay, must be part of its site. In what kind of world did Roark build his temple?For what kind of men? Look around you. Can you see a shrine becoming sacred byserving as a setting for Mr. Hopton Stoddard? For Mr. Ralston Holcombe? For Mr.Peter Keating? When you look at them all, do you hate Ellsworth Toohey—or do youdamn Howard Roark for the unspeakable indignity which he did commit? EllsworthToohey is right, that temple is a sacrilege, though not in the sense he meant. Ithink Mr. Toohey knows that, however. When you see a man casting pearls withoutgetting even a pork chop in return—it is not against the swine that you feelindignation. It is against the man who valued his pearls so little that he waswilling to fling them into the muck and to let them become the occasion for awhole concert of grunting, transcribed by the court stenographer.”“Miss Francon, I hardly think that this line of testimony is relevant oradmissible ...”“The witness must be allowed to testify,” the judge declared unexpectedly. Hehad been bored and he liked to watch Dominique’s figure. Besides, he knew thatthe audience was enjoying it, in the sheer excitement of scandal, even thoughtheir sympathies were with Hopton Stoddard.“Your Honor, some misunderstanding seems to have occurred,” said the attorney.“Miss Francon, for whom are you testifying? For Mr. Roark or Mr. Stoddard?”“For Mr. Stoddard, of course. I am stating the reasons why Mr. Stoddard shouldwin this case. I have sworn to tell the truth.”“Proceed,” said the judge.“All the witnesses have told the truth. But not the whole truth. I am merelyfilling in the omissions. They spoke of a threat and of hatred. They were right.The Stoddard Temple is a threat to many things. If it were allowed to exist,nobody would dare to look at himself in the mirror. And that is a cruel thing todo to men. Ask anything of men. Ask them to achieve wealth, fame, love,brutality, murder, self-sacrifice. But don’t ask them to achieve self-respect.They will hate your soul. Well, they know best. They must have their reasons.They won’t say, of course, that they hate you. They will say that you hate them.It’s near enough, I suppose. They know the emotion involved. Such are men asthey are. So what is the use of being a martyr to the impossible? What is theuse of building for a world that does not exist?”“Your Honor, I don’t see what possible bearing this can have on...”“I am proving your case for you. I am proving why you must go with EllsworthToohey as you will anyway. The Stoddard Temple must be destroyed. Not to savemen from it, but to save it from men. What’s the difference, however? Mr.Stoddard wins. I am in full agreement with everything that’s being done here,except for one point. I didn’t think we should be allowed to get away with thatpoint. Let us destroy, but don’t let us pretend that we are committing an act ofvirtue. Let us say that we are moles and we object to mountain peaks. Or,perhaps, that we are lemmings, the animals who cannot help swimming out toself-destruction. I realize fully that at this moment I am as futile as HowardRoark. This is my Stoddard Temple—my first and my last.” She inclined her headto the judge. “That is all, Your Honor.”“Your witness,” the attorney snapped to Roark.“No questions,” said Roark.Dominique left the stand.The attorney bowed to the bench and said: “The plaintiff rests.”The judge turned to Roark and made a vague gesture, inviting him to proceed.Roark got up and walked to the bench, the brown envelope in hand. He took out ofthe envelope ten photographs of the Stoddard Temple and laid them on the judge’sdesk. He said:“The defense rests.”009 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_009_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART TWOEthicsEDITOR’S NOTE: AR’s purpose in her novels was the projection of an ideal man.“The portrayal of a moral ideal,” she wrote, is “my ultimate literary goal [...]to which any didactic, intellectual or philosophical values contained in [the]novel are only the means” (“The Goal of My Writing,” Romantic Manifesto, 1975,p. 162).To create a hero such as Howard Roark, she had to identify in detail her view ofmoral perfection. “Since my purpose,” she said, “is the presentation of an idealman [...] I had to define and present a rational code of ethics” (Introductionto The Fountainhead, 50th anniversary edition, 1993, p. vii).In this section devoted to ethics, we begin with Roark’s speech at the climax ofThe Fountainhead. Roark had agreed to design Cortlandt, a government housingproject, on definite terms—but a breach of contract by the government left himwithout legal recourse. His response was to dynamite the building while it wasstill under construction. Roark’s courtroom speech, a moral defense of hisactions, is an early statement of AR’s ethics."},{"pageContent":"1. SelfishnessFROM ROARK’S SPEECH“THOUSANDS OF years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He wasprobably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light. He wasconsidered an evildoer who had dealt with a demon mankind dreaded. Butthereafter men had fire to keep them warm, to cook their food, to light theircaves. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had lifted darknessoff the earth. Centuries later, the first man invented the wheel. He wasprobably torn on the rack he had taught his brothers to build. He was considereda transgressor who ventured into forbidden territory. But thereafter, men couldtravel past any horizon. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and hehad opened the roads of the world.“That man, the unsubmissive and first, stands in the opening chapter of everylegend mankind has recorded about its beginning. Prometheus was chained to arock and torn by vultures—because he had stolen the fire of the gods. Adam wascondemned to suffer—because he had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge.Whatever the legend, somewhere in the shadows of its memory mankind knew thatits glory began with one and that that one paid for his courage.“Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roadsarmed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all hadthis in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed,and the response they received—hatred. The great creators—the thinkers, theartists, the scientists, the inventors—stood alone against the men of theirtime. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention wasdenounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was consideredimpossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was consideredsinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they sufferedand they paid. But they won.“No creator was prompted by a desire to serve his brothers, for his brothersrejected the gift he offered and that gift destroyed the slothful routine oftheir lives. His truth was his only motive. His own truth, and his own work toachieve it in his own way. A symphony, a book, an engine, a philosophy, anairplane or a building—that was his goal and his life. Not those who heard,read, operated, believed, flew or inhabited the thing he had created. Thecreation, not its users. The creation, not the benefits others derived from it.The creation which gave form to his truth. He held his truth above all thingsand against all men.“His vision, his strength, his courage came from his own spirit. A man’s spirit,however, is his self. That entity which is his consciousness. To think, to feel,to judge, to act are functions of the ego.“The creators were not selfless. It is the whole secret of their power—that itwas self-sufficient, self-motivated, self-generated. A first cause, a fount ofenergy, a life force, a Prime Mover. The creator served nothing and no one. Hehad lived for himself.“And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are theglory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement.“Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. Hisbrain is his only weapon. Animals obtain food by force. Man has no claws, nofangs, no horns, no great strength of muscle. He must plant his food or hunt it.To plant, he needs a process of thought. To hunt, he needs weapons, and to makeweapons—a process of thought. From this simplest necessity to the highestreligious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are andeverything we have comes from a single attribute of man—the function of hisreasoning mind.“But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as acollective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreementreached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon manyindividual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act—the processof reason—must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal among manymen. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs tobreathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All thefunctions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred.“We inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel. Wemake a cart. The cart becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane.But all through the process what we receive from others is only the end productof their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes thisproduct as material, uses it and originates the next step. This creative facultycannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single,individual men. That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learnfrom one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man cangive another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means ofsurvival.“Nothing is given to man on earth. Everything he needs has to be produced. Andhere man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways—bythe independent work of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds ofothers. The creator originates. The parasite borrows. The creator faces naturealone. The parasite faces nature through an intermediary.“The creator’s concern is the conquest of nature. The parasite’s concern is theconquest of men.“The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal iswithin himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others becomehis prime motive.“The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot workunder any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated toany consideration whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and inmotive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary.“The basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order tobe fed. He places relations first. He declares that man exists in order to serveothers. He preaches altruism.“Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and placeothers above self.“No man can live for another. He cannot share his spirit just as he cannot sharehis body. But the second-hander has used altruism as a weapon of exploitationand reversed the base of mankind’s moral principles. Men have been taught everyprecept that destroys the creator. Men have been taught dependence as a virtue.“The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite inmotive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothingbut mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach to itin reality—the man who lives to serve others—is the slave. If physical slaveryis repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the spirit?The conquered slave has a vestige of honor. He has the merit of having resistedand of considering his condition evil. But the man who enslaves himselfvoluntarily in the name of love is the basest of creatures. He degrades thedignity of man and he degrades the conception of love. But this is the essenceof altruism.“Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give.Yet one cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes beforedistribution—or there will be nothing to distribute. The need of the creatorcomes before the need of any possible beneficiary. Yet we are taught to admirethe second-hander who dispenses gifts he has not produced above the man who madethe gifts possible. We praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act ofachievement.“Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the suffering ofothers. But suffering is a disease. Should one come upon it, one tries to giverelief and assistance. To make that the highest test of virtue is to makesuffering the most important part of life. Then man must wish to see otherssuffer—in order that he may be virtuous. Such is the nature of altruism. Thecreator is not concerned with disease, but with life. Yet the work of thecreators has eliminated one form of disease after another, in man’s body andspirit, and brought more relief from suffering than any altruist could everconceive.“Men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creatoris the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim withthe current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men havebeen taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the manwho stands alone.“Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness theideal of virtue. But the creator is the egotist in the absolute sense, and theselfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. These arefunctions of the self.“Here the basic reversal is most deadly. The issue has been perverted and manhas been left no alternative—and no freedom. As poles of good and evil, he wasoffered two conceptions: egotism and altruism. Egotism was held to mean thesacrifice of others to self. Altruism—the sacrifice of self to others. This tiedman irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his ownpain borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake ofself. When it was added that man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap wasclosed. Man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal—under the threat thatsadism was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated onmankind.“This was the device by which dependence and suffering were perpetuated asfundamentals of life.“The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. The choice is independence ordependence. The code of the creator or the code of the second-hander. This isthe basic issue. It rests upon the alternative of life or death. The code of thecreator is built on the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive.The code of the second-hander is built on the needs of a mind incapable ofsurvival. All that which proceeds from man’s independent ego is good. All thatwhich proceeds from man’s dependence upon men is evil.“The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He isthe man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does notfunction through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Notin his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not inthe source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man—and he asks noother man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutualrespect possible between men.“Degrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degreeof a man’s independence, initiative and personal love for his work determineshis talent as a worker and his worth as a man. Independence is the only gauge ofhuman virtue and value. What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has orhasn’t done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity. There is nostandard of personal dignity except independence.“In all proper relationships there is no sacrifice of anyone to anyone. Anarchitect needs clients, but he does not subordinate his work to their wishes.They need him, but they do not order a house just to give him a commission. Menexchange their work by free, mutual consent to mutual advantage when theirpersonal interests agree and they both desire the exchange. If they do notdesire it, they are not forced to deal with each other. They seek further. Thisis the only possible form of relationship between equals. Anything else is arelation of slave to master, or victim to executioner.“No work is ever done collectively, by a majority decision. Every creative jobis achieved under the guidance of a single individual thought. An architectrequires a great many men to erect his building. But he does not ask them tovote on his design. They work together by free agreement and each is free in hisproper function. An architect uses steel, glass, concrete, produced by others.But the materials remain just so much steel, glass and concrete until he touchesthem. What he does with them is his individual product and his individualproperty. This is the only pattern for proper co-operation among men.“The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man’s first duty is tohimself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons ofothers. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, provided his wish does notdepend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creativefaculty, his thinking, his work. But it does not include the sphere of thegangster, the altruist and the dictator.“A man thinks and works alone. A man cannot rob, exploit or rule—alone. Robbery,exploitation and ruling presuppose victims. They imply dependence. They are theprovince of the second-hander.“Rulers of men are not egotists. They create nothing. They exist entirelythrough the persons of others. Their goal is in their subjects, in the activityof enslaving. They are as dependent as the beggar, the social worker and thebandit. The form of dependence does not matter.“But men were taught to regard second-handers—tyrants, emperors, dictators—asexponents of egotism. By this fraud they were made to destroy the ego,themselves and others. The purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators. Orto harness them. Which is a synonym.“From the beginning of history, the two antagonists have stood face to face: thecreator and the second-hander. When the first creator invented the wheel, thefirst second-hander responded. He invented altruism.“The creator—denied, opposed, persecuted, exploited—went on, moved forward andcarried all humanity along on his energy. The second-hander contributed nothingto the process except the impediments. The contest has another name: theindividual against the collective.“The ‘common good’ of a collective—a race, a class, a state—was the claim andjustification of every tyranny ever established over men. Every major horror ofhistory was committed in the name of an altruistic motive. Has any act ofselfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of altruism? Doesthe fault lie in men’s hypocrisy or in the nature of the principle? The mostdreadful butchers were the most sincere. They believed in the perfect societyreached through the guillotine and the firing squad. Nobody questioned theirright to murder since they were murdering for an altruistic purpose. It wasaccepted that man must be sacrificed for other men. Actors change, but thecourse of the tragedy remains the same. A humanitarian who starts withdeclarations of love for mankind and ends with a sea of blood. It goes on andwill go on so long as men believe that an action is good if it is unselfish.That permits the altruist to act and forces his victims to bear it. The leadersof collectivist movements ask nothing for themselves. But observe the results.“The only good which men can do to one another and the only statement of theirproper relationship is—Hands off!“Now observe the results of a society built on the principle of individualism.This, our country. The noblest country in the history of men. The country ofgreatest achievement, greatest prosperity, greatest freedom. This country wasnot based on selfless service, sacrifice, renunciation or any precept ofaltruism. It was based on a man’s right to the pursuit of happiness. His ownhappiness. Not anyone else’s. A private, personal, selfish motive. Look at theresults. Look into your own conscience.“It is an ancient conflict. Men have come close to the truth, but it wasdestroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. Civilization is theprogress toward a society of privacy. The savage’s whole existence is public,ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man freefrom men.“Now, in our age, collectivism, the rule of the second-hander and second-rater,the ancient monster, has broken loose and is running amuck. It has brought mento a level of intellectual indecency never equaled on earth. It has reached ascale of horror without precedent. It has poisoned every mind. It has swallowedmost of Europe. It is engulfing our country.“I am an architect. I know what is to come by the principle on which it isbuilt. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live.“Now you know why I dynamited Cortlandt.“I designed Cortlandt. I gave it to you. I destroyed it.“I destroyed it because I did not choose to let it exist. It was a doublemonster. In form and in implication. I had to blast both. The form was mutilatedby two second-handers who assumed the right to improve upon that which they hadnot made and could not equal. They were permitted to do it by the generalimplication that the altruistic purpose of the building superseded all rightsand that I had no claim to stand against it.“I agreed to design Cortlandt for the purpose of seeing it erected as I designedit and for no other reason. That was the price I set for my work. I was notpaid.“I do not blame Peter Keating. He was helpless. He had a contract with hisemployers. It was ignored. He had a promise that the structure he offered wouldbe built as designed. The promise was broken. The love of a man for theintegrity of his work and his right to preserve it are now considered a vagueintangible and an unessential. You have heard the prosecutor say that. Why wasthe building disfigured? For no reason. Such acts never have any reason, unlessit’s the vanity of some second-handers who feel they have a right to anyone’sproperty, spiritual or material. Who permitted them to do it? No particular manamong the dozens in authority. No one cared to permit it or to stop it. No onewas responsible. No one can be held to account. Such is the nature of allcollective action.“I did not receive the payment I asked. But the owners of Cortlandt got whatthey needed from me. They wanted a scheme devised to build a structure ascheaply as possible. They found no one else who could do it to theirsatisfaction. I could and did. They took the benefit of my work and made mecontribute it as a gift. But I am not an altruist. I do not contribute gifts ofthis nature.“It is said that I have destroyed the home of the destitute. It is forgottenthat but for me the destitute could not have had this particular home. Those whowere concerned with the poor had to come to me, who have never been concerned,in order to help the poor. It is believed that the poverty of the future tenantsgave them a right to my work. That their need constituted a claim on my life.That it was my duty to contribute anything demanded of me. This is thesecond-hander’s credo now swallowing the world.“I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone’s right to one minute of mylife. Nor to any part of my energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. No matterwho makes the claim, how large their number or how great their need.“I wished to come here and say that I am a man who does not exist for others.“It had to be said. The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing.“I wished to come here and say that the integrity of a man’s creative work is ofgreater importance than any charitable endeavor. Those of you who do notunderstand this are the men who’re destroying the world.“I wished to come here and state my terms. I do not care to exist on any others.“I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom andto take no part in a slave society. To my country, I wish to give the ten yearswhich I will spend in jail if my country exists no longer. I will spend them inmemory and in gratitude for what my country has been. It will be my act ofloyalty, my refusal to live or work in what has taken its place.“My act of loyalty to every creator who ever lived and was made to suffer by theforce responsible for the Cortlandt I dynamited. To every tortured hour ofloneliness, denial, frustration, abuse he was made to spend—and to the battleshe won. To every creator whose name is known—and to every creator who lived,struggled and perished unrecognized before he could achieve. To every creatorwho was destroyed in body or in spirit. To Henry Cameron. To Steven Mallory. Toa man who doesn’t want to be named, but who is sitting in this courtroom andknows that I am speaking of him.”010 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_010_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: This excerpt from The Virtue of Selfishness explains why ARcalled her ethics “selfishness.”WHY “SELFISHNESS”?THE TITLE of this book may evoke the kind of question that I hear once in awhile: “Why do you use the word ‘selfishness’ to denote virtuous qualities ofcharacter, when that word antagonizes so many people to whom it does not meanthe things you mean?”To those who ask it, my answer is: “For the reason that makes you afraid of it.”But there are others, who would not ask that question, sensing the moralcowardice it implies, yet who are unable to formulate my actual reason or toidentify the profound moral issue involved. It is to them that I will give amore explicit answer.It is not a mere semantic issue nor a matter of arbitrary choice. The meaningascribed in popular usage to the word “selfishness” is not merely wrong: itrepresents a devastating intellectual “package-deal,” which is responsible, morethan any other single factor, for the arrested moral development of mankind.In popular usage, the word “selfishness” is a synonym of evil; the image itconjures is of a murderous brute who tramples over piles of corpses to achievehis own ends, who cares for no living being and pursues nothing but thegratification of the mindless whims of any immediate moment.Yet the exact meaning and dictionary definition of the word “selfishness” is:concern with one’s own interests.This concept does not include a moral evaluation; it does not tell us whetherconcern with one’s own interests is good or evil; nor does it tell us whatconstitutes man’s actual interests. It is the task of ethics to answer suchquestions.The ethics of altruism has created the image of the brute, as its answer, inorder to make men accept two inhuman tenets: (a) that any concern with one’s owninterests is evil, regardless of what these interests might be, and (b) that thebrute’s activities are in fact to one’s own interest (which altruism enjoins manto renounce for the sake of his neighbors).For a view of the nature of altruism, its consequences and the enormity of themoral corruption it perpetrates, I shall refer you to Atlas Shrugged—or to anyof today’s newspaper headlines. What concerns us here is altruism’s default inthe field of ethical theory.There are two moral questions which altruism lumps together into one“package-deal”: ( I ) What are values? (2) Who should be the beneficiary ofvalues? Altruism substitutes the second for the first; it evades the task ofdefining a code of moral values, thus leaving man, in fact, without moralguidance.Altruism declares that any action taken for the benefit of others is good, andany action taken for one’s own benefit is evil. Thus the beneficiary of anaction is the only criterion of moral value—and so long as that beneficiary isanybody other than oneself, anything goes.Hence the appalling immorality, the chronic injustice, the grotesque doublestandards, the insoluble conflicts and contradictions that have characterizedhuman relationships and human societies throughout history, under all thevariants of the altruist ethics.Observe the indecency of what passes for moral judgments today. An industrialistwho produces a fortune, and a gangster who robs a bank are regarded as equallyimmoral, since they both sought wealth for their own “selfish” benefit. A youngman who gives up his career in order to support his parents and never risesbeyond the rank of grocery clerk is regarded as morally superior to the youngman who endures an excruciating struggle and achieves his personal ambition. Adictator is regarded as moral, since the unspeakable atrocities he committedwere intended to benefit “the people,” not himself.Observe what this beneficiary-criterion of morality does to a man’s life. Thefirst thing he learns is that morality is his enemy; he has nothing to gain fromit, he can only lose; self-inflicted loss, self-inflicted pain and the gray,debilitating pall of an incomprehensible duty is all that he can expect. He mayhope that others might occasionally sacrifice themselves for his benefit, as hegrudgingly sacrifices himself for theirs, but he knows that the relationshipwill bring mutual resentment, not pleasure—and that, morally, their pursuit ofvalues will be like an exchange of unwanted, unchosen Christmas presents, whichneither is morally permitted to buy for himself. Apart from such times as hemanages to perform some act of self-sacrifice, he possesses no moralsignificance: morality takes no cognizance of him and has nothing to say to himfor guidance in the crucial issues of his life; it is only his own personal,private, “selfish” life and, as such, it is regarded either as evil or, at best,amoral.Since nature does not provide man with an automatic form of survival, since hehas to support his life by his own effort, the doctrine that concern with one’sown interests is evil means that man’s desire to live is evil—that man’s life,as such, is evil. No doctrine could be more evil than that.Yet that is the meaning of altruism, implicit in such examples as the equationof an industrialist with a robber. There is a fundamental moral differencebetween a man who sees his self-interest in production and a man who sees it inrobbery. The evil of a robber does not lie in the fact that he pursues his owninterests, but in what he regards as to his own interest; not in the fact thathe pursues his values, but in what he chose to value; not in the fact that hewants to live, but in the fact that he wants to live on a subhuman level (see“The Objectivist Ethics”).If it is true that what I mean by “selfishness” is not what is meantconventionally, then this is one of the worst indictments of altruism: it meansthat altruism permits no concept of a self-respecting, self-supporting man—a manwho supports his life by his own effort and neither sacrifices himself norothers. It means that altruism permits no view of men except as sacrificialanimals and profiteers-on-sacrifice, as victims and parasites—that it permits noconcept of a benevolent co-existence among men—that it permits no concept ofjustice.If you wonder about the reasons behind the ugly mixture of cynicism and guilt inwhich most men spend their lives, these are the reasons: cynicism, because theyneither practice nor accept the altruist morality—guilt, because they dare notreject it.To rebel against so devastating an evil, one has to rebel against its basicpremise. To redeem both man and morality, it is the concept of “selfishness”that one has to redeem.The first step is to assert man’s right to a moral existence—that is: torecognize his need of a moral code to guide the course and the fulfillment ofhis own life.For a brief outline of the nature and the validation of a rational morality, seemy lecture on “The Objectivist Ethics” which follows. The reasons why man needsa moral code will tell you that the purpose of morality is to define man’sproper values and interests, that concern with his own interests is the essenceof a moral existence, and that man must be the beneficiary of his own moralactions.Since all values have to be gained and/or kept by men’s actions, any breachbetween actor and beneficiary necessitates an injustice: the sacrifice of somemen to others, of the actors to the nonactors, of the moral to the immoral.Nothing could ever justify such a breach, and no one ever has.The choice of the beneficiary of moral values is merely a preliminary orintroductory issue in the field of morality. It is not a substitute for moralitynor a criterion of moral value, as altruism has made it. Neither is it a moralprimary: it has to be derived from and validated by the fundamental premises ofa moral system.The Objectivist ethics holds that the actor must always be the beneficiary ofhis action and that man must act for his own rational self-interest. But hisright to do so is derived from his nature as man and from the function of moralvalues in human life—and, therefore, is applicable only in the context of arational, objectively demonstrated and validated code of moral principles whichdefine and determine his actual self-interest. It is not a license “to do as hepleases” and it is not applicable to the altruists’ image of a “selfish” brutenor to any man motivated by irrational emotions, feelings, urges, wishes orwhims.This is said as a warning against the kind of “Nietzschean egoists” who, infact, are a product of the altruist morality and represent the other side of thealtruist coin: the men who believe that any action, regardless of its nature, isgood if it is intended for one’s own benefit. Just as the satisfaction of theirrational desires of others is not a criterion of moral value, neither is thesatisfaction of one’s own irrational desires. Morality is not a contest ofwhims.A similar type of error is committed by the man who declares that since man mustbe guided by his own independent judgment, any action he chooses to take ismoral if he chooses it. One’s own independent judgment is the means by which onemust choose one’s actions, but it is not a moral criterion nor a moralvalidation: only reference to a demonstrable principle can validate one’schoices.Just as man cannot survive by any random means, but must discover and practicethe principles which his survival requires, so man’s self-interest cannot bedetermined by blind desires or random whims, but must be discovered and achievedby the guidance of rational principles. This is why the Objectivist ethics is amorality of rational self-interest—or of rational selfishness.Since selfishness is “concern with one’s own interests,” the Objectivist ethicsuses that concept in its exact and purest sense. It is not a concept that onecan surrender to man’s enemies, nor to the unthinking misconceptions,distortions, prejudices and fears of the ignorant and the irrational. The attackon “selfishness” is an attack on man’s self-esteem; to surrender one, is tosurrender the other....011 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_011_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: These selections from “The Objectivist Ethics,” a talk given atthe University of Wisconsin in 1961, discuss the fundamental issue of ethics:why man needs values at all—and, therefore, how ethics is grounded in the factsof reality.THE OBJECTIVIST ETHICSSINCE I am to speak on the Objectivist Ethics, I shall begin by quoting its bestrepresentative—John Galt, in Atlas Shrugged:“Through centuries of scourges and disasters, brought about by your code ofmorality, you have cried that your code had been broken, that the scourges werepunishment for breaking it, that men were too weak and too selfish to spill allthe blood it required. You damned man, you damned existence, you damned thisearth, but never dared to question your code.... You went on crying that yourcode was noble, but human nature was not good enough to practice it. And no onerose to ask the question: Good?—by what standard?“You wanted to know John Galt’s identity. I am the man who has asked thatquestion.“Yes, this is an age of moral crisis.... Your moral code has reached its climax,the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish to go on living, whatyou now need is not to return to morality ... but to discover it.”What is morality, or ethics? It is a code of values to guide man’s choices andactions—the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of hislife. Ethics, as a science, deals with discovering and defining such a code.The first question that has to be answered, as a precondition of any attempt todefine, to judge or to accept any specific system of ethics, is: Why does manneed a code of values?Let me stress this. The first question is not: What particular code of valuesshould man accept? The first question is: Does man need values at all—and why?Is the concept of value, of “good or evil” an arbitrary human invention,unrelated to, underived from and unsupported by any facts of reality—or is itbased on a metaphysical fact, on an unalterable condition of man’s existence? (Iuse the word “metaphysical” to mean: that which pertains to reality, to thenature of things, to existence.) Does an arbitrary human convention, a merecustom, decree that man must guide his actions by a set of principles—or isthere a fact of reality that demands it? Is ethics the province of whims: ofpersonal emotions, social edicts and mystic revelations—or is it the province ofreason? Is ethics a subjective luxury—or an objective necessity?In the sorry record of the history of mankind’s ethics—with a few rare, andunsuccessful, exceptions—moralists have regarded ethics as the province ofwhims, that is: of the irrational. Some of them did so explicitly, byintention—others implicitly, by default. A “whim” is a desire experienced by aperson who does not know and does not care to discover its cause.No philosopher has given a rational, objectively demonstrable, scientific answerto the question of why man needs a code of values. So long as that questionremained unanswered, no rational, scientific, objective code of ethics could bediscovered or defined. The greatest of all philosophers, Aristotle, did notregard ethics as an exact science; he based his ethical system on observationsof what the noble and wise men of his time chose to do, leaving unanswered thequestions of: why they chose to do it and why he evaluated them as noble andwise.Most philosophers took the existence of ethics for granted, as the given, as ahistorical fact, and were not concerned with discovering its metaphysical causeor objective validation. Many of them attempted to break the traditionalmonopoly of mysticism in the field of ethics and, allegedly, to define arational, scientific, nonreligious morality. But their attempts consisted oftrying to justify them on social grounds, merely substituting society for God.The avowed mystics held the arbitrary, unaccountable “will of God” as thestandard of the good and as the validation of their ethics. The neomysticsreplaced it with “the good of society,” thus collapsing into the circularity ofa definition such as “the standard of the good is that which is good forsociety.” This meant, in logic—and, today, in worldwide practice—that “society”stands above any principles of ethics, since it is the source, standard andcriterion of ethics, since “the good” is whatever it wills, whatever it happensto assert as its own welfare and pleasure. This meant that “society” may doanything it pleases, since “the good” is whatever it chooses to do because itchooses to do it. And—since there is no such entity as “society,” since societyis only a number of individual men—this meant that some men (the majority or anygang that claims to be its spokesman) are ethically entitled to pursue any whims(or any atrocities) they desire to pursue, while other men are ethically obligedto spend their lives in the service of that gang’s desires.This could hardly be called rational, yet most philosophers have now decided todeclare that reason has failed, that ethics is outside the power of reason, thatno rational ethics can ever be defined, and that in the field of ethics—in thechoice of his values, of his actions, of his pursuits, of his life’s goats—manmust be guided by something other than reason. By what?Faith—instinct—intuition—revelation—feeling—taste—urge—wish—whim. Today, as inthe past, most philosophers agree that the ultimate standard of ethics is whim(they call it “arbitrary postulate” or “subjective choice” or “emotionalcommitment”) —and the battle is only over the question of whose whim: one’s ownor society’s or the dictator’s or God’s. Whatever else they may disagree about,today’s moralists agree that ethics is a subjective issue and that the threethings barred from its field are: reason—mind—reality.If you wonder why the world is now collapsing to a lower and ever lower rung ofhell, this is the reason.If you want to save civilization, it is this premise of modern ethics—and of allethical history—that you must challenge.To challenge the basic premise of any discipline, one must begin at thebeginning. In ethics, one must begin by asking: What are values? Why does manneed them?“Value” is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept “value” is not aprimary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and forwhat? It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the faceof an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no values arepossible.I quote from Galt’s speech: “There is only one fundamental alternative in theuniverse: existence or nonexistence—and it pertains to a single class ofentities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter isunconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course ofaction. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease toexist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issueof life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generatedaction. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elementsremain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity thatthings can be good or evil.”To make this point fully clear, try to imagine an immortal, indestructiblerobot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything,which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured ordestroyed. Such an entity would not be able to have any values; it would havenothing to gain or to lose; it could not regard anything as for or against it,as serving or threatening its welfare, as fulfilling or frustrating itsinterests. It could have no interests and no goals.Only a living entity can have goals or can originate them. And it is only aliving organism that has the capacity for self-generated, goal-directed action.On the physical level, the functions of all living organisms, from the simplestto the most complex—from the nutritive function in the single cell of an amoebato the blood circulation in the body of a man—are actions generated by theorganism itself and directed to a single goal: the maintenance of the organism’slife.1 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-1]An organism’s life depends on two factors: the material or fuel which it needsfrom the outside, from its physical background, and the action of its own body,the action of using that fuel properly. What standard determines what is properin this context? The standard is the organism’s life, or: that which is requiredfor the organism’s survival.No choice is open to an organism in this issue: that which is required for itssurvival is determined by its nature, by the kind of entity it is. Manyvariations, many forms of adaptation to its background are possible to anorganism, including the possibility of existing for a while in a crippled,disabled or diseased condition, but the fundamental alternative of its existenceremains the same: if an organism fails in the basic functions required by itsnature—if an amoeba’s protoplasm stops assimilating food, or if a man’s heartstops beating—the organism dies. In a fundamental sense, stillness is theantithesis of life. Life can be kept in existence only by a constant process ofself-sustaining action. The goal of that action, the ultimate value which, to bekept, must be gained through its every moment, is the organism’s life.An ultimate value is that final goal or end to which all lesser goals are themeans—and it sets the standard by which all lesser goals are evaluated. Anorganism’s life is its standard of value: that which furthers its life is thegood, that which threatens it is the evil.Without an ultimate goal or end, there can be no lesser goals or means: a seriesof means going off into an infinite progression toward a nonexistent end is ametaphysical and epistemological impossibility. It is only an ultimate goal, anend in itself, that makes the existence of values possible. Metaphysically, lifeis the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by aconstant process of action. Epistemologically, the concept of “value” isgenetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of “life.” Tospeak of “value” as apart from “life” is worse than a contradiction in terms.“It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible.”In answer to those philosophers who claim that no relation can be establishedbetween ultimate ends or values and the facts of reality, let me stress that thefact that living entities exist and function necessitates the existence ofvalues and of an ultimate value which for any given living entity is its ownlife. Thus the validation of value judgments is to be achieved by reference tothe facts of reality. The fact that a living entity is, determines what it oughtto do. So much for the issue of the relation between “is” and “ought.” [...] Man has no automatic code of survival. He has no automatic course of action, noautomatic set of values. His senses do not tell him automatically what is goodfor him or evil, what will benefit his life or endanger it, what goals he shouldpursue and what means will achieve them, what values his life depends on, whatcourse of action it requires. His own consciousness has to discover the answersto all these questions—but his consciousness will not function automatically.Man, the highest living species on this earth—the being whose consciousness hasa limitless capacity for gaining knowledge—man is the only living entity bornwithout any guarantee of remaining conscious at all. Man’s particulardistinction from all other living species is the fact that his consciousness isvolitional.Just as the automatic values directing the functions of a plant’s body aresufficient for its survival, but are not sufficient for an animal’s —so theautomatic values provided by the sensory-perceptual mechanism of itsconsciousness are sufficient to guide an animal, but are not sufficient for man.Man’s actions and survival require the guidance of conceptual values derivedfrom conceptual knowledge. But conceptual knowledge cannot be acquiredautomatically.A “concept” is a mental integration of two or more perceptual concretes, whichare isolated by a process of abstraction and united by means of a specificdefinition. Every word of man’s language, with the exception of proper names,denotes a concept, an abstraction that stands for an unlimited number ofconcretes of a specific kind. It is by organizing his perceptual material intoconcepts, and his concepts into wider and still wider concepts that man is ableto grasp and retain, to identify and integrate an unlimited amount of knowledge,a knowledge extending beyond the immediate perceptions of any given, immediatemoment. Man’s sense organs function automatically; man’s brain integrates hissense data into percepts automatically; but the process of integrating perceptsinto concepts—the process of abstraction and of concept-formation-is notautomatic.The process of concept-formation does not consist merely of grasping a fewsimple abstractions, such as “chair,” “table,” “hot,” “cold,” and of learning tospeak. It consists of a method of using one’s consciousness, best designated bythe term “conceptualizing.” It is not a passive state of registering randomimpressions. It is an actively sustained process of identifying one’simpressions in conceptual terms, of integrating every event and everyobservation into a conceptual context, of grasping relationships, differences,similarities in one’s perceptual material and of abstracting them into newconcepts, of drawing inferences, of making deductions, of reaching conclusions,of asking new questions and discovering new answers and expanding one’sknowledge into an ever-growing sum. The faculty that directs this process, thefaculty that works by means of concepts, is: reason. The process is thinking.Reason is the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided byman’s senses. It is a faculty that man has to exercise by choice. Thinking isnot an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free tothink or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focusedawareness. The act of focusing one’s consciousness is volitional. Man can focushis mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he canunfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to anychance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirectedsensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections itmight happen to make.When man unfocuses his mind, he may be said to be conscious in a subhuman senseof the word, since he experiences sensations and perceptions. But in the senseof the word applicable to man—in the sense of a consciousness which is aware ofreality and able to deal with it, a consciousness able to direct the actions andprovide for the survival of a human being—an unfocused mind is not conscious.Psychologically, the choice “to think or not” is the choice “to focus or not.”Existentially, the choice “to focus or not” is the choice “to be conscious ornot.” Metaphysically, the choice “to be conscious or not” is the choice of lifeor death.Consciousness—for those living organisms which possess it—is the basic means ofsurvival. For man, the basic means of survival is reason. Man cannot survive, asanimals do, by the guidance of mere percepts. A sensation of hunger will tellhim that he needs food (if he has learned to identify it as “hunger”), but itwill not tell him how to obtain his food and it will not tell him what food isgood for him or poisonous. He cannot provide for his simplest physical needswithout a process of thought. He needs a process of thought to discover how toplant and grow his food or how to make weapons for hunting. His percepts mightlead him to a cave, if one is available—but to build the simplest shelter, heneeds a process of thought. No percepts and no “instincts” will tell him how tolight a fire, how to weave cloth, how to forge tools, how to make a wheel, howto make an airplane, how to perform an appendectomy, how to produce an electriclight bulb or an electronic tube or a cyclotron or a box of matches. Yet hislife depends on such knowledge—and only a volitional act of his consciousness, aprocess of thought, can provide it.But man’s responsibility goes still further: a process of thought is notautomatic nor “instinctive” nor involuntary—nor infalliable. Man has to initiateit, to sustain it and to bear responsibility for its results. He has to discoverhow to tell what is true or false and how to correct his own errors; he has todiscover how to validate his concepts, his conclusions, his knowledge; he has todiscover the rules of thought, the laws of logic, to direct his thinking. Naturegives him no automatic guarantee of the efficacy of his mental effort.Nothing is given to man on earth except a potential and the material on which toactualize it. The potential is a superlative machine: his consciousness; but itis a machine without a spark plug, a machine of which his own will has to be thespark plug, the self-starter and the driver; he has to discover how to use itand he has to keep it in constant action. The material is the whole of theuniverse, with no limits set to the knowledge he can acquire and to theenjoyment of life he can achieve. But everything he needs or desires has to belearned, discovered and produced by him—by his own choice, by his own effort, byhis own mind.A being who does not know automatically what is true or false, cannot knowautomatically what is right or wrong, what is good for him or evil. Yet he needsthat knowledge in order to live. He is not exempt from the laws of reality, heis a specific organism of a specific nature that requires specific actions tosustain his life. He cannot achieve his survival by arbitrary means nor byrandom motions nor by blind urges nor by chance nor by whim. That which hissurvival requires is set by his nature and is not open to his choice. What isopen to his choice is only whether he will discover it or not, whether he willchoose the right goals and values or not. He is free to make the wrong choice,but not free to succeed with it. He is free to evade reality, he is free tounfocus his mind and stumble blindly down any road he pleases, but not free toavoid the abyss he refuses to see. Knowledge, for any conscious organism, is themeans of survival; to a living consciousness, every “is” implies an “ought.” Manis free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty ofunconsciousness: destruction. Man is the only living species that has the powerto act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of hishistory.What, then, are the right goals for man to pursue? What are the values hissurvival requires? That is the question to be answered by the science of ethics.And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why man needs a code of ethics.Now you can assess the meaning of the doctrines which tell you that ethics isthe province of the irrational, that reason cannot guide man’s life, that hisgoals and values should be chosen by vote or by whim—that ethics has nothing todo with reality, with existence, with one’s practical actions and concerns—orthat the goal of ethics is beyond the grave, that the dead need ethics, not theliving.Ethics is not a mystic fantasy—nor a social convention—nor a dispensable,subjective luxury, to be switched or discarded in any emergency. Ethics is anobjective, metaphysical necessity of man’s survival—not by the grace of thesupernatural nor of your neighbors nor of your whims, but by the grace ofreality and the nature of life.I quote from Galt’s speech: “Man has been called a rational being, butrationality is a matter of choice—and the alternative his nature offers him is:rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man—by choice; he has to holdhis life as a value—by choice; he has to learn to sustain it—by choice; he hasto discover the values it requires and practice his virtues—by choice. A code ofvalues accepted by choice is a code of morality.”The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics—the standard by which one judgeswhat is good or evil—is man’s life, or: that which is required for man’ssurvival qua man.Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the lifeof a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it isthe evil.Since everything man needs has to be discovered by his own mind and produced byhis own effort, the two essentials of the method of survival proper to arational being are: thinking and productive work. [...] [T]he Objectivist ethics is the morality of life—as against the three majorschools of ethical theory, the mystic, the social, the subjective, which havebrought the world to its present state and which represent the morality ofdeath.These three schools differ only in their method of approach, not in theircontent. In content, they are merely variants of altruism, the ethical theorywhich regards man as a sacrificial animal, which holds that man has no right toexist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of hisexistence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value.The differences occur only over the question of who is to be sacrificed to whom.Altruism holds death as its ultimate goal and standard of value—and it islogical that renunciation, resignation, self-denial, and every other form ofsuffering, including self-destruction, are the virtues it advocates. And,logically, these are the only things that the practitioners of altruism haveachieved and are achieving now.Observe that these three schools of ethical theory are anti-life, not merely incontent, but also in their method of approach.The mystic theory of ethics is explicitly based on the premise that the standardof value of man’s ethics is set beyond the grave, by the laws or requirements ofanother, supernatural dimension, that ethics is impossible for man to practice,that it is unsuited for and opposed to man’s life on earth, and that man musttake the blame for it and suffer through the whole of his earthly existence, toatone for the guilt of being unable to practice the impracticable. The Dark Agesand the Middle Ages are the existential monument to this theory of ethics.The social theory of ethics substitutes “society” for God—and although it claimsthat its chief concern is life on earth, it is not the life of man, not the lifeof an individual, but the life of a disembodied entity, the collective, which,in relation to every individual, consists of everybody except himself. As far asthe individual is concerned, his ethical duty is to be the selfless, voiceless,rightless slave of any need, claim or demand asserted by others. The motto “dogeat dog”—which is not applicable to capitalism nor to dogs—is applicable to thesocial theory of ethics. The existential monuments to this theory are NaziGermany and Soviet Russia.The subjectivist theory of ethics is, strictly speaking, not a theory, but anegation of ethics. And more: it is a negation of reality, a negation not merelyof man’s existence, but of all existence. Only the concept of a fluid, plastic,indeterminate, Heraclitean universe could permit anyone to think or to preachthat man needs no objective principles of action—that reality gives him a blankcheck on values—that anything he cares to pick as the good or the evil, willdo—that a man’s whim is a valid moral standard, and that the only question ishow to get away with it. The existential monument to this theory is the presentstate of our culture.It is not men’s immorality that is responsible for the collapse now threateningto destroy the civilized world, but the kind of moralities men have been askedto practice. The responsibility belongs to the philosophers of altruism. Theyhave no cause to be shocked by the spectacle of their own success, and no rightto damn human nature: men have obeyed them and have brought their moral idealsinto full reality.It is philosophy that sets men’s goals and determines their course; it is onlyphilosophy that can save them now. Today, the world is facing a choice: ifcivilization is to survive, it is the altruist morality that men have to reject.I will close with the words of John Galt, which I address, as he did, to all themoralists of altruism, past or present:“You have been using fear as your weapon and have been bringing death to man ashis punishment for rejecting your morality. We offer him life as his reward foraccepting ours.”012 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_012_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"2. Anti-Altruism This selection from Atlas Shrugged (published in 1957) is a more detaileddiscussion, by the novel’s hero, John Galt, of the meaning and consequences ofaltruism.FROM GALT’S SPEECH“WHOEVER IS now within reach of my voice, whoever is man the victim, not man thekiller, I am speaking at the deathbed of your mind, at the brink of thatdarkness in which you’re drowning, and if there still remains within you thepower to struggle to hold on to those fading sparks which had been yourself—useit now. The word that has destroyed you is ‘sacrifice.’ Use the last of yourstrength to understand its meaning. You’re still alive. You have a chance.“ ‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the rejection of the worthless, but of the precious.‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the rejection of the evil for the sake of the good,but of the good for the sake of the evil. ‘Sacrifice’ is the surrender of thatwhich you value in favor of that which you don’t.“If you exchange a penny for a dollar, it is not a sacrifice; if you exchange adollar for a penny, it is. If you achieve a career you wanted, after years ofstruggle, it is not a sacrifice; if you then renounce it for the sake of arival, it is. If you own a bottle of milk and gave it to your starving child, itis not a sacrifice; if you give it to your neighbor’s child and let your owndie, it is.“If you give money to help a friend, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to aworthless stranger, it is. If you give your friend a sum you can afford, it isnot a sacrifice; if you give him money at the cost of your own discomfort, it isonly a partial virtue, according to this sort of moral standard; if you give himmoney at the cost of disaster to yourself—that is the virtue of sacrifice infull.“If you renounce all personal desire and dedicate your life to those you love,you do not achieve full virtue: you still retain a value of your own, which isyour love. If you devote your life to random strangers, it is an act of greatervirtue. If you devote your life to serving men you hate—that is the greatest ofthe virtues you can practice.“A sacrifice is the surrender of a value. Full sacrifice is full surrender ofall values. If you wish to achieve full virtue, you must seek no gratitude inreturn for your sacrifice, no praise, no love, no admiration, no self-esteem,not even the pride of being virtuous; the faintest trace of any gain dilutesyour virtue. If you pursue a course of action that does not taint your life byany joy, that brings you no value in matter, no value in spirit, no gain, noprofit, no reward—if you achieve this state of total zero, you have achieved theideal of moral perfection.“You are told that moral perfection is impossible to man—and, by this standard,it is. You cannot achieve it so long as you live, but the value of your life andof your persons is gauged by how closely you succeed in approaching that idealzero which is death.“If you start, however, as a passionless blank, as a vegetable seeking to beeaten, with no values to reject and no wishes to renounce, you will not win thecrown of sacrifice. It is not a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted. It is not asacrifice to give your life for others, if death is your personal desire. Toachieve the virtue of sacrifice, you must want to live, you must love it, youmust burn with passion for this earth and for all the splendor it can giveyou—you must feel the twist of every knife as it slashes your desires away fromyour reach and drains your love out of your body. It is not mere death that themorality of sacrifice holds out to you as an ideal, but death by slow torture.“Do not remind me that it pertains only to this life on earth. I am concernedwith no other. Neither are you.“If you wish to save the last of your dignity, do not call your best actions a‘sacrifice’: that term brands you as immoral. If a mother buys food for herhungry child rather than a hat for herself, it is not a sacrifice: she valuesthe child higher than the hat; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of mother whosehigher value is the hat, who would prefer her child to starve and feeds him onlyfrom a sense of duty. If a man dies fighting for his own freedom, it is not asacrifice: he is not willing to live as a slave; but it is a sacrifice to thekind of man who’s willing. If a man refuses to sell his convictions, it is not asacrifice, unless he is the sort of man who has no convictions.“Sacrifice could be proper only for those who have nothing to sacrifice—novalues, no standards, no judgment—those whose desires are irrational whims,blindly conceived and lightly surrendered. For a man of moral stature, whosedesires are born of rational values, sacrifice is the surrender of the right tothe wrong, of the good to the evil.“The creed of sacrifice is a morality for the immoral—a morality that declaresits own bankruptcy by confessing that it can’t impart to men any personal stakein virtues or value, and that their souls are sewers of depravity, which theymust be taught to sacrifice. By his own confession, it is impotent to teach mento be good and can only subject them to constant punishment.“Are you thinking, in some foggy stupor, that it’s only material values thatyour morality requires you to sacrifice? And what do you think are materialvalues? Matter has no value except as a means for the satisfaction of humandesires. Matter is only a tool of human values. To what service are you asked togive the material tools your virtue has produced? To the service of that whichyou regard as evil: to a principle you do not share, to a person you do notrespect, to the achievement of a purpose opposed to your own—else your gift isnot a sacrifice.“Your morality tells you to renounce the material world and to divorce yourvalues from matter. A man whose values are given no expression in material form,whose existence is unrelated to his ideals, whose actions contradict hisconvictions, is a cheap little hypocrite—yet that is the man who obeys yourmorality and divorces his values from matter. The man who loves one woman, butsleeps with another—the man who admires the talent of a worker, but hiresanother—the man who considers one cause to be just, but donates his money to thesupport of another—the man who holds high standards of craftsmanship, butdevotes his effort to the production of trash—these are the men who haverenounced matter, the men who believe that the values of their spirit cannot bebrought into material reality.“Do you say it is the spirit that such men have renounced? Yes, of course. Youcannot have one without the other. You are an indivisible entity of matter andconsciousness. Renounce your consciousness and you become a brute. Renounce yourbody and you become a fake. Renounce the material world and you surrender it toevil.“And that is precisely the goal of your morality, the duty that your codedemands of you. Give to that which you do not enjoy, serve that which you do notadmire, submit to that which you consider evil—surrender the world to the valuesof others, deny, reject, renounce your self. Your self is your mind: renounce itand you become a chunk of meat ready for any cannibal to swallow.“It is your mind that they want you to surrender—all those who preach the creedof sacrifice, whatever their tags or their motives, whether they demand it forthe sake of your soul or of your body, whether they promise you another life inheaven or a full stomach on this earth. Those who start by saying: ‘It isselfish to pursue your own wishes, you must sacrifice them to the wishes ofothers’—end up by saying: ‘It is selfish to uphold your convictions, you mustsacrifice them to the convictions of others.’“This much is true: the most selfish of all things is the independent mind thatrecognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than itsjudgment of truth. You are asked to sacrifice your intellectual integrity, yourlogic, your reason, your standard of truth—in favor of becoming a prostitutewhose standard is the greatest good for the greatest number.“If you search your code for guidance, for an answer to the question: ‘What isthe good?’—the only answer you will find is ‘The good of others.’ The good iswhatever others wish, whatever you feel they feel they wish, or whatever youfeel they ought to feel. ‘The good of others’ is a magic formula that transformsanything into gold, a formula to be recited as a guarantee of moral glory and asa fumigator for any action, even the slaughter of a continent. Your standard ofvirtue is not an object, not an act, not a principle, but an intention. You needno proof, no reasons, no success, you need not achieve in fact the good ofothers—all you need to know is that your motive was the good of others, not yourown. Your only definition of the good is a negation: the good is the ‘non-goodfor me.’“Your code—which boasts that it upholds eternal, absolute, objective moralvalues and scorns the conditional, the relative and the subjective—your codehands out, as its version of the absolute, the following rule of moral conduct:If you wish it, it’s evil; if others wish it, it’s good; if the motive of youraction is your welfare, don’t do it; if the motive is the welfare of others,then anything goes.“As this double-jointed, double-standard morality splits you in half, so itsplits mankind into two enemy camps: one is you, the other is all the rest ofhumanity. You are the only outcast who has no right to wish to live. You are theonly servant, the rest are the masters, you are the only giver, the rest are thetakers, you are the eternal debtor, the rest are the creditors never to be paidoff. You must not question their right to your sacrifice, or the nature of theirwishes and their needs: their right is conferred upon them by a negative, by thefact that they are ‘non-you.’“For those of you who might ask questions, your code provides a consolationprize and booby-trap: it is for your own happiness, it says, that you must servethe happiness of others, the only way to achieve your jov is to give it up toothers, the only way to achieve your prosperity is to surrender your wealth toothers, the only way to protect your life is to protect all men exceptyourself—and if you find no joy in this procedure, it is your own fault and theproof of your evil; if you were good, you would find your happiness in providinga banquet for others, and your dignity in existing on such crumbs as they mightcare to toss you.“You who have no standard of self-esteem, accept the guilt and dare not ask thequestions. But you know the unadmitted answer, refusing to acknowledge what yousee, what hidden premise moves your world. You know it, not in honest statement,but as a dark uneasiness within you, while you flounder between guilty cheatingand grudgingly practicing a principle too vicious to name.“I, who do not accept the unearned, neither in values nor in guilt, am here toask the questions you evaded. Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others,but not your own? If enjoyment is a value, why is it moral when experienced byothers, but immoral when experienced by you? If the sensation of eating a cakeis a value, why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goalfor you to achieve in the stomach of others? Why is it immoral for you todesire, but moral for others to do so? Why is it immoral to produce a value andkeep it, but moral to give it away? And if it is not moral for you to keep avalue, why is it moral for others to accept it? If you are selfless and virtuouswhen you give it, are they not selfish and vicious when they take it? Doesvirtue consist of serving vice? Is the moral purpose of those who are good,self-immolation for the sake of those who are evil?“The answer you evade, the monstrous answer is: No, the takers are not evil,provided they did not earn the value you gave them. It is not immoral for themto accept it, provided they are unable to produce it, unable to deserve it,unable to give you any value in return. It is not immoral for them to enjoy it,provided they do not obtain it by right.“Such is the secret core of your creed, the other half of your double standard:it is immoral to live by your own effort, but moral to live by the effort ofothers—it is immoral to consume your own product, but moral to consume theproducts of others—it is immoral to earn, but moral to mooch—it is the parasiteswho are the moral justification for the existence of the producers, but theexistence of the parasites is an end in itself—it is evil to profit byachievement, but good to profit by sacrifice—it is evil to create your ownhappiness, but good to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others.“Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by oppositerules: those who may desire anything and those who may desire nothing, thechosen and the damned, the riders and the carriers, the eaters and the eaten.What standard determines your caste? What passkey admits you to the moral elite?The passkey is lack of value.“Whatever the value involved, it is your lack of it that gives you a claim uponthose who don’t lack it. It is your need that gives you a claim to rewards. Ifyou are able to satisfy your need, your ability annuls your right to satisfy it.But a need you are unable to satisfy gives you first right to the lives ofmankind.“If you succeed, any man who fails is your master; if you fail, any man whosucceeds is your serf. Whether your failure is just or not whether your wishesare rational or not, whether your misfortune is undeserved or the result of yourvices, it is misfortune that gives you a right to rewards. It is pain,regardless of its nature or cause, pain as a primary absolute, that gives you amortgage on all of existence.“If you heal your pain by your own effort, you receive no moral credit: yourcode regards it scornfully as an act of self-interest. Whatever value you seekto acquire, be it wealth or food or love or rights, if you acquire it by meansof your virtue, your code does not regard it as a moral acquisition: youoccasion no loss to anyone, it is a trade, not alms; a payment, not a sacrifice.The deserved belongs in the selfish, commercial realm of mutual profit; it isonly the undeserved that calls for that moral transaction which consists ofprofit to one at the price of disaster to the other. To demand rewards for yourvirtue is selfish and immoral; it is your lack of virtue that transforms yourdemand into a moral right.“A morality that holds need as a claim, holds emptiness—nonexistence—as itsstandard of value; it rewards an absence, a defeat: weakness, inability,incompetence, suffering, disease, disaster, the lack, the fault, .the flaw—thezero.“Who provides the account to pay these claims? Those who are cursed for beingnon-zeros, each to the extent of his distance from that ideal. Since all valuesare the product of virtues, the degree of your virtue is used as the measure ofyour penalty; the degree of your faults is used as the measure of your gain.Your code declares that the rational man must sacrifice himself to theirrational, the independent man to parasites, the honest man to the dishonest,the man of justice to the unjust, the productive man to thieving loafers, theman of integrity to compromising knaves, the man of self-esteem to snivelingneurotics. Do you wonder at the meanness of soul in those you see around you?The man who achieves these virtues will not accept your moral code; the man whoaccepts your moral code will not achieve these virtues.“Under a morality of sacrifice, the first value you sacrifice is morality ; thenext is self-esteem. When need is the standard, every man is both victim andparasite. As a victim, he must labor to fill the needs of others, leavinghimself in the position of a parasite whose needs must be filled by others. Hecannot approach his fellow men except in one of two disgraceful roles: he isboth a beggar and a sucker.“You fear the man who has a dollar less than you, that dollar is rightfully his,he makes you feel like a moral defrauder. You hate the man who has a dollar morethan you, that dollar is rightfully yours, he makes you feel that you aremorally defrauded. The man below is a source of your guilt, the man above is asource of your frustrations. You do not know what to surrender or demand, whento give and when to grab, what pleasure in life is rightfully yours and whatdebt is still unpaid to others—you struggle to evade, as ‘theory,’ the knowledgethat by the moral standard you’ve accepted you are guilty every moment of yourlife, there is no mouthful of food you swallow that is not needed by someonesomewhere on earth—and you give up the problem in blind resentment, you concludethat moral perfection is not to be achieved or desired, that you will muddlethrough by snatching as snatch can and by avoiding the eyes of the young, ofthose who look at you as if self-esteem were possible and they expected you tohave it. Guilt is all that you retain within your soul—and so does every otherman, as he goes past, avoiding your eyes. Do you wonder why your morality hasnot achieved brotherhood on earth or the good will of man to man?“The justification of sacrifice, that your morality propounds, is more corruptthan the corruption it purports to justify. The motive of your sacrifice, ittells you, should be love-the love you ought to feel for every man. A moralitythat professes the belief that the values of the spirit are more precious thanmatter, a morality that teaches you to scorn a whore who gives her bodyindiscriminately to all men—this same morality demands that you surrender yoursoul to promiscuous love for all comers.“As there can be no causeless wealth, so there can be no causeless love or anysort of causeless emotion. An emotion is a response to a fact of reality, anestimate dictated by your standards. To love is to value. The man who tells youthat it is possible to value without values, to love those whom you appraise asworthless, is the man who tells you that it is possible to grow rich byconsuming without producing and that paper money is as valuable as gold.“Observe that he does not expect you to feel a causeless fear. When his kind getinto power, they are expert at contriving means of terror, at giving you amplecause to feel the fear by which they desire to rule you. But when it comes tolove, the highest of emotions, you permit them to shriek at you accusingly thatyou are a moral delinquent if you’re incapable of feeling causeless love. When aman feels fear without reason, you call him to the attention of a psychiatrist;you are not so careful to protect the meaning, the nature and the dignity oflove.“Love is the expression of one’s values, the greatest reward you can earn forthe moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person, theemotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues ofanother. Your morality demands that you divorce your love from values and handit down to any vagrant, not as response to his worth, but as response to hisneed, not as reward, but as alms, not as a payment for virtues, but as a blankcheck on vices. Your morality tells you that the purpose of love is to set youfree of the bonds of morality, that love is superior to moral judgment; thattrue love transcends, forgives and survives every manner of evil in its object,and the greater the love the greater the depravity it permits to the loved. Tolove a man for his virtues is paltry and human, it tells you; to love him forhis flaws is divine. To love those who are worthy of it is self-interest; tolove the unworthy is sacrifice. You owe your love to those who don’t deserve it,and the less they deserve it, the more love you owe them—the more loathsome theobject, the nobler your love—the more unfastidious your love, the greater thevirtue—and if you can bring your soul to the state of a dump heap that welcomesanything on equal terms, if you can cease to value moral values, you haveachieved the state of moral perfection.“Such is your morality of sacrifice and such are the twin ideals it offers: torefashion the life of your body in the image of a human stockyard, and the lifeof your spirit in the image of a dump.“Such was your goal—and you’ve reached it. Why do you now moan complaints aboutman’s impotence and the futility of human aspirations? Because you were unableto prosper by seeking destruction? Because you were unable to find joy byworshipping pain? Because you were unable to live by holding death as yourstandard of value?“The degree of your ability to live was the degree to which you broke your moralcode, yet you believe that those who preach it are friends of humanity, you damnyourself and dare not question their motives or their goals. Take a look at themnow, when you face your last choice—and if you choose to perish, do so with fullknowledge of how cheaply so small an enemy has claimed your life....013 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_013_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: The following essay was written in 1974 for The Ayn Rand Letter,a biweekly journal published between 1971 and 1976. The essay shows theconnection between altruism and America’s moral decay, one symptom of which isthe introduction of affirmative action” programs. The ”National Day ofHumiliation“ was a 1973 Senate resolution, passed without opposition, callingfor America to ”humble [itself] before almighty God.”MORAL INFLATIONHERE ARE some of the things that men had to evade in order to think up a moralatrocity such as a “National Day of Humiliation.”Self-abasement is the antithesis of morality. If a man has acted immorally, butregrets it and wants to atone for it, it is not self-abasement that prompts him,but some remnant of love for moral values—and it is not self-abasement that heexpresses, but a longing to regain his self-esteem. Humility is not arecognition of one’s failings, but a rejection of morality. “I am no good” is astatement that may be uttered only in the past tense. To say: “I am no good” isto declare: “—and I never intend to be any better.”One can feel nothing but mistrust, disgust and contempt for a man who spits inhis own face. To drag others along into the same degradation and spit in theface of one’s own country, is as base an affront to morality as can be imagined.Yet this has been the policy of American intellectuals for many decades. That itis now adopted by a Senator and approved “with no debate or opposition” by theU.S. Senate, is a measure of the extent to which moral proclamations and moralprinciples are not taken seriously by today’s public leaders.One may disapprove of one’s country’s policies, one may disagree with most orwith all of its citizens, one may seek to change, reform or improve particularlaws, conditions or trends; and if one finds an entire country so evil that itdeserves damnation, one must leave it. But to stay here and to damn thiscountry—this country!—on such phony, trashy allegations as “acquiescence [?] tocorruption and waste [!!]” is to step out of any moral bounds.What effect did the sponsors of that resolution expect it to have on theAmerican people?There still are people in this country who lost loved ones in World War I. Thereare more people who carry the unhealed wounds of World War II, of Korea, ofVietnam. There are the disabled, the crippled, the mangled of those wars’battlefields. No one has ever told them why they had to fight nor what theirsacrifices accomplished; it was certainly not “to make the world safe fordemocracy”—look at that world now. The American people have borne it all,trusting their leaders, hoping that someone knew the purpose of that ghastlydevastation. The United States gained nothing from those wars, except thegrowing burden of paying reparations to the whole world—the kind of burden thatused to be imposed on a defeated nation.People have borne patiently the unending drain of their wealth, their effort,their standard of living—first, to help the unemployed of the New Deal era, thenthe war allies, then the former enemies, and now the unemployables of the entireglobe. People have seen and read enough to know the subhuman squalor of humanexistence in other countries and the atrocities to which men submit. In theirinnocent, foolishly overgenerous benevolence, the American people have beenwilling to help, knowing that theirs is the greatest country on this ravagedearth, a blessed oasis in a desert of bloody savagery.Then to hear a proclamation of their country’s self-abasement-in this day ofraucously chauvinistic boasting, when every racist tribe in every backyard ofthe globe, from Albania to Uganda, is proclaiming the uniquely sanctified valueof the non-achievements of its non-culture—to hear that they, the Americanpeople, have not done enough and that their reward is a “National Day ofHumiliation,” is more than human beings should be asked to bear or understand.If, under a leadership of this kind, people are losing respect for morality andcrumbling into cynicism, bitterness, helpless anger, or blind hatred—can oneblame them?Yet the altruist morality dictates such policies to the nation’s leaders. Eventhough altruism declares that “it is more blessed to give than to receive,” itdoes not work that way in practice. The givers are never blessed; the more theygive, the more is demanded of them; complaints, reproaches and insults are theonly response they get for practicing altruism’s virtues (or for their actualvirtues). Altruism cannot permit a recognition of virtue; it cannot permitself-esteem or moral innocence. Guilt is altruism’s stock in trade, and theinducing of guilt is its only means of self-perpetuation. If the giver is notkept under a torrent of degrading, demeaning accusations, he might take a lookaround and put an end to the self-sacrificing.Altruists are concerned only with those who suffer—not with those who providerelief from suffering, not even enough to care whether they are able to survive.When no actual suffering can be found, the altruists are compelled to invent ormanufacture it. Observe their admission that, compared to the rest of the world,people do not suffer from real poverty in this country—they suffer from relativepoverty (i.e., from envy). Observe that with the inflation of altruism into agovernment policy—with public cash and legislative favors pouring upon thepressure groups of newly minted sufferers—the proper, basic functions of thegovernment are crumbling, corroded by neglect and “lack of funds” (!). Yet theseare the functions required for the survival of the givers, who carry all therest on their shoulders and are the greatest victims of altruistic exploitation:the middle class.These basic functions are: the police, the law courts, the military. (Theserepresent the only moral justification for the existence of a government: theprotection of individual rights, i.e., the protection of individual citizensfrom the initiators of physical force.) What is the state of these governmentalfunctions today?Observe the conditions of an average American’s existence. He has lost the mostrudimentary form of protection: the safety of city streets. He is in danger onhis way to work in the morning, and on his way home; he is in danger if he stepsout of the house after dark; his family are in danger if they go shopping,visiting, or walking in a public park. They dare not ride the subway, yet theyare threatened with the loss of their safest transportation: their car. Criminalattacks are a daily occurrence, any time, any place: purse-snatching, mugging,burglary, rape, murder. The police are helpless: they have been brought close toimpotence by impossible rules, which protect the “rights” of the criminals. Thepolicemen struggle on as best they can, but they admit bitterly that there islittle they can do: they risk their lives to arrest a thug, but the courts sethim free.The average man cannot seek redress in court, whether in criminal or civilmatters: he cannot afford it. The cost, the length of time required, and theunpredictable outcome of non-objective laws, have made him give up the hope ofappealing to justice, whether he suffers from a neighbor’s petty chiseling orfrom some major violation of his rights. He has grown stoically—orcynically—indifferent: he knows (or senses) that the main violator is thegovernment, that no muggers can deprive him of the sums which the governmentseizes at income-tax time.The moral inflation leaves him unprotected against the financial inflation: heworks harder and harder (often in the form of “moonlighting”), but his realincome is shrinking, he is not rising in the world, he is not getting anywhere,he is running on a hopeless treadmill. Try to tell his wife—in the midst of herdesperate struggle to provide the family with decent meals, which they can’tafford—that she must bear “humiliation” for the sin of “waste”!Just as these people sense that today’s leadership does not regard them as worthprotecting, so they sense that their country, too, is regarded as not worthdefending. The military services have survived, so far—in the midst of anunrelenting campaign of attacks, vilifications, and demands that the defensebudget be cut (even though welfare projects, not defense, consume the largestshare of the national budget).To add insult to the American people’s injury, The New York Times published aneditorial (May 25, 1972), entitled “Retreat on Rights,” which said: “The SupremeCourt decisions permitting criminal convictions by less than unanimous juriesand narrowing witnesses’ immunity against self-incrimination are disquieting intheir practical effects but, even more, as portents of things to come.“In the United States and other free countries, the drift of history in thiscentury has been toward strengthening the power of government and diminishingthe liberties of the individual. One of the few countervailing pressures hasbeen the libertarian tendency of the Supreme Court to construe the Bill ofRights and the Fourteenth Amendment broadly in behalf of accused individuals,racial and religious minorities, the impoverished and ignorant, and politicalradicals and dissenters. The Court’s new majority bloc made up mostly of Nixonappointees may be bringing that tendency to an end.” After discussing thepossible consequences of the Supreme Court decision—such as: “Prosecutors willfind it easier to get convictions in cases which now end in hung juries”—theeditorial urges the country to hope that the effects will not prove “destructiveof individual rights.”This means that we must fight the world’s drift toward statism by protecting theindividual rights of criminals.(Don’t remind me that an accused person is not necessarily a criminal and thathe must be protected against unjust accusations. The rights of the accused arenot a primary—they are a consequence derived from a man’s inalienable,individual rights. A consequence cannot survive the destruction of its cause.What good will it do you to be protected in the rare emergency of a falsearrest, if you are treated as the rightless subject of an unlimited governmentin your daily life?)A mawkish sentimentality toward criminals, coupled with a brutal cruelty towardinnocent citizens, is not a new phenomenon. In my review of The Language ofDissent by Lowell B. Mason (The Objectivist Newsletter, August 1963), I wrote:“Mr. Mason makes a profoundly important observation: whenever a country’scriminal laws are more lenient than its civil laws, it means that the country isaccepting the basic principle of statism and is moving toward a totalitarianstate. (Such a trend means that crimes against individuals are regarded asnegligible, while the collectivist concept of ‘Crimes against the State’ becomesparamount and supersedes all rights.) In Soviet Russia, he points out, criminalswere treated ‘with tolerance and circumspection. On the other hand, thoseaccused of violating the state’s political and economic commands were sentencedto death or exiled to Siberia without any semblance of trial as we know the wordhere in America.’ ”Now observe the odd assortment of individuals whose rights and liberties aresingled out by the Times editorial for special protection. “Racial and religiousminorities,” as well as “political radicals and dissenters,” should find itoffensive to be lumped with “the impoverished and ignorant” and the (probably)criminal. The obvious question is: What about the rights and liberties of thehonest, the educated, the self-supporting, the majority? The answer is that theassortment is dictated by and represents a confession of altruism’s essence: itis only suffering, weakness, failure, default—real or imaginary, spiritual ormaterial or numerical or moral—that entitle men to rights, liberties and publicconcern; happiness, strength, success, virtue do not.In a cultural atmosphere of this sort, who can find any inspiration or desire topreserve his moral integrity? The signs of moral deterioration are all aroundus. But, to the great credit of this country, most people, so far, have notgiven up.The ideologues of altruism have miscalculated in regard to this country.Materially, they have obtained more than they could hope to extort from anyother, poorer nation. Spiritually, they have failed: they mistook generosity forguilt; the guilt-infection did not take hold. Men who live on an earned incomeare not likely to accept an unearned guilt.Since the inflation of altruism has not breached the American people’s basicself-esteem, the altruists are now trying to revive the grotesque, anti-moralabsurdity of original sin—i.e., of prenatal guilt—in a secular form. Havingfailed to induce personal guilt, they are struggling to induce racial guitt—byproclaiming that people must suffer and pay for the (alleged) sins of theirfathers.This prehistorical notion requires more than the destruction of morality. Itrequires the obliteration of all the concepts which centuries of growingcivilization struggled to identify: reason, individualism, personal integrity(and person), volition, choice, responsibility, language, understanding, andhuman communication.The inversion of all standards—the propagation of racism as antiracist, ofinjustice as just, of immorality as moral, and the reasoning behind it, which isworse than the offenses—is flagrantly evident in the policy of preferentialtreatment for minorities (i.e., racial quotas) in employment and education. (Seemy essay on “Racism” in The Virtue of Selfishness.) If there is a quicker way todestroy people than by preaching brotherly love while spreading blind,inter-racial hatred, you name it.The most eloquent example of that policy is the DeFunis case.In 1971, Marco DeFunis, Jr., a Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude graduate of theUniversity of Washington in Seattle, was denied admission to the University’sLaw School. The school accepted 275 out of 1600 applicants (for an eventualclass of 150). They were chosen mainly on the basis of special tests whichpurported to give a student’s “Predicted First Year Average,” estimating hisability to succeed in law school—and, in part, on the basis of various otherconsiderations. Four racial minority groups—Black, Chicano, American Indian, andFilipino—were singled out for preferential treatment; their applications wereprocessed separately and differently from all the others. I quote from JusticeDouglas’s opinion in a subsequent Supreme Court decision: “Thirty-seven minorityapplicants were admitted under this procedure. Of these, 36 had Predicted FirstYear Averages below DeFunis’ 76.23, and 30 had averages below 74.5, and thuswould ordinarily have been summarily rejected by the Chairman.... What placesthis case in a special category is the fact that the school did not choose oneset of criteria but two, and then determined which to apply to a given applicanton the basis of his race.”DeFunis sued the University of Washington, claiming that he was a victim of“reverse discrimination,” that his constitutional rights had been violated andhe had been denied the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of “equal protection ofthe laws.” The Washington trial court upheld his claim and ordered the school toadmit him. The school complied, but appealed. The Washington Supreme Courtreversed the decision. DeFunis took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court,obtaining a stay which permitted him to attend the Law School until the finaldisposition of his case.The case aroused intense public controversy. Various groups and organizationsfiled friend-of-the-court briefs, supporting DeFunis or opposing him—a greaternumber of briefs than in any other case in recent history. It was clear to bothsides that a crucially important moral issue was at stake. The Court announcedits decision on April 23, 1974. By that time, DeFunis was completing his lastterm at the Law School, and the school had agreed to let him graduate,regardless of the Court’s decision. This permitted the Supreme Court to avoidjudgment on the issue.It was the Court’s conservative majority that took advantage of a legaltechnicality and—in a brief, unsigned opinion—declared the case to be moot,since DeFunis’s rights were not affected any longer. The four liberal Justicesdissented, objecting to the avoidance of the constitutional issues. JusticeDouglas wrote a separate, dissenting opinion of an extremely confusing,inconclusive nature. The moral question was left unanswered.What is of special significance to this country’s public morale and morality, isthe kind of argumentation that this case brought forth in advance of the SupremeCourt’s ruling.The brief of the B’nai B’rith Anti-Defamation League, filed in support ofDeFunis, states: “If the Constitution prohibits exclusion of blacks and otherminorities on racial grounds, it cannot permit the exclusion of whites on racialgrounds.... discrimination on the basis of race is illegal, immoral,unconstitutional, inherently wrong and destructive of democratic society.... Aracial quota is a device for establishing a status, a caste, determiningsuperiority or inferiority for a class measured by race without regard toindividual merit.”This, of course, is unanswerable. The advocates of racial quotas do not attemptto answer it; they ignore it, or worse: they declare that their goal is to endracial discrimination eventually by means of practicing it temporarily. (This isborrowed from the methodology of Marxism, which claims that we can bring thestate to wither away eventually by means of establishing a totalitariandictatorship temporarily. In neither case are we given any indication of howsuch a trick is to be accomplished.)An article eloquently entitled “Discriminating to end discrimination” (The NewYork Times Magazine, April 14, 1974) presents a good cross section of argumentsoffered by both sides of the issue. “Advocates of affirmative action [i.e., ofpreferential treatment] like to compare the racial situation in America to tworunners, one of whom has had his legs shackled for 200 years.... Removing theshackles doesn’t make the two instantly equal in ability to compete. Thepreviously shackled runner has to be given some advantage in order to competeeffectively until he gets his legs into condition.” (How? By shackling the fastrunner, lowering the standards, and slowing down everyone’s running? No answeris given. But it must be mentioned that many intelligent blacks regard this typeof argument as a racist insult, which it is.)The article quotes a woman attorney for some anti-DeFunis groups, who said: “Itis now well understood, however, that our society cannot be completelycolor-blind in the short term if we are to have a color-blind society in thelong term.” She “argues that a racial classification can only be presumedunconstitutional if it disadvantages a group subject to a history ofdiscrimination or held down by special disabilities. She contends that the 14thAmendment was meant to help powerless, oppressed minorities, and that the whitemajority needs no such help.” (This is altruism superseding and rewriting theConstitution: if you have no special disabilities, you have no rights and noprotection of the laws.)The University of Washington, according to the article, “concedes that somewhite students may be excluded from law school because of the affirmative-actionprogram, but it maintains that its program is ‘necessary’ to achieve an‘overriding purpose’—i.e., to increase the number of minority lawyers in thestate and the nation.... And, the university notes, had it not been for thenation’s history of racial discrimination, white students would have had farmore students to compete with than they do now.”This type of argument, which modern intellectuals permit themselves to use withgrowing frequency, is a measure of their growing distance from reality: itconsists in changing one factor of a complex situation and assuming that all therest would remain unchanged. In fact, if racial discrimination hampered theintellectual development of black students, the absence of such discriminationwould not have brought more competition to white students, but less: it wouldhave created more universities to satisfy a greater demand (assuming a freeeconomy) .But if projected potentialities are to be equated with actuality, if “might havebeen” is to be the equivalent of “was,” then I submit the following argument: Ifmy grandfather had come to this country and if he had gone into the oilbusiness, he would have given stiff competition to Nelson A. Rockefeller’sgrandfather and, therefore, Mr. Rockefeller would not be as rich as he is todayand, therefore, I demand my constitutional right to half of Mr. Rockefeller’smoney.Absurd? Not by today’s standards. The grossness of such absurdity did notprevent the broadcast of an editorial which declared: “WCBS Radio endorses theargument of the University of Washington Law School—had it not been for thenation’s history of racial discrimination, white students would have far morestudents to compete with than they do today. Affirmative-action programs thatgive preference to qualified minorities over more qualified whites may seemunjust, but that injustice pales beside the monstrosities of two centuries ofsegregation.” (May 1, 1974.)Dr. Alvin Lashinsky, Vice President of the Jewish Rights Council, who broadcasta reply to that editorial, sounded like a welcome voice of sanity: “We utterlycondemn what appears to us to be a call by WCBS for retribution—to have childrenpay for acts their grandfathers committed, and for innocents of other minoritiesto also suffer only because their skin is white.... Excellence of ourprofessions has always been achieved by high standards and the only way to giveminorities self-respect is by improving the ability of the poorly qualifiedthrough remedial education beforehand, otherwise the finished product may be apoorly qualified physician or lawyer or a poorly skilled surgeon or even asemi-literate clerk or secretary. Does anyone, WCBS or the minorities, reallywant this?” (May 3, 1974.)The answer is: Yes—as far as the ideologues of altruism are concerned—that isprecisely what they want. They do not want to lift the poorly qualified, but totear down the competent; they do not want to help the weak, but to destroy thestrong. How many of them would admit such motives, even to themselves, I do notknow. Observe that the WCBS editorial did not dare openly to demand therejection of the qualified in favor of the unqualified; it fudged, it spoke of“qualified minorities” versus “more qualified whites,” making it a matter ofdegree—which does not make the injustice any the less vicious.While the altruists proclaim that the financially or racially handicapped aretheir chief concern, none of them noticed the fact that DeFunis was doublyhandicapped. The admission requirements at the University of Washington LawSchool (as at most universities) are highly arbitrary: apart from scholasticachievement, the committee considers such factors as “recommendations” fromprominent persons or groups (i.e., pull) and a student’s “extra-curricular andcommunity activities” (i.e., altruism). “Community activities” are a luxurywhich DeFunis could not have afforded: his “extra-curricular activity” consistedin working his way through college. And if the persecution suffered by astudent’s ancestors is grounds for giving him special advantages, DeFunisbelongs to the racial minority that suffered the longest, most horrendous recordof persecution in history: he is Jewish. So much for the sincerity of thealtruists’ motives.Now consider the moral import of their arguments. Observe that the commondenominator of their claims is the total absence of the concept of a person. Anindividual and a group are regarded as interchangeable—and it is instructive toobserve the switching. A group can be “shackled for 200 years,” an individualcannot—but it is individuals who collect reparations, not the group as a whole.A group, the white majority, must pay for their ancestors’ racialdiscrimination, it is alleged—but it is white individuals who pay, by beingdenied job and education opportunities, not the group as a whole. It is,allegedly, an “overriding purpose” to increase the number of minority lawyers inthe nation—but minority lawyers are individuals, and what is being “overriden”?The rights of other individuals, who are white.The crass indifference of all such tribal profiteers to the reality of anindividual human life, is their most vicious and shocking characteristic. Anindividual human life is a brief and fragile period of time. If the goal of“reverse discrimination” is a color-blind society in some indeterminate future,what good will it do to DeFunis (and to thousands like him), who is denied aprofessional education in the brief, irreplaceable years of his youth and findshis plans, his future, his life-course wrecked? Who has the right to do this tohim? For the sake of what? For the alleged future benefit of society, i.e., of alarge majority of people? But it is for the sake of a minority that he has beensacrificed.There is no such thing as a collective guilt. A country may be held responsiblefor the actions of its government and it may be guilty of an evil (such asstarting a war)—but then it is a public, not a private, matter and the entirecountry has to bear the burden of paying reparations for it. The notion ofrandom individuals paying for the sins of an entire country, is an unspeakablemodern atrocity.This country has no guilt to atone for in regard to its black citizens.Certainly, slavery was an enormous evil. But a country that fought a civil warto abolish slavery, has atoned for it on such a scale that to talk about racialquotas in addition, is grotesque. However, it is not for injustices committed bythe government that the modern racists are demanding reparations, but for racialprejudice—i.e., for the personal views of private citizens. How can anindividual be held responsible for the views of others, whom he has no power tocontrol, who may be his intellectual enemies, whose views may be the opposite ofhis own? What can make him responsible for them? The answer we hear is: The factthat his skin is of the same color as theirs. If this is not an obliteration ofmorality, of intellectual integrity, of individual rights, of the freedom ofman’s mind (and, incidentally, of the First Amendment), you take it from here; Ican’t—it turns my stomach.What I am able to discuss is the ancient notion of paying for the sins of one’sfathers, and the effect of this notion on morality. Suppose a man leads adecent, responsible life financially: he works hard, lives within his means,plans his future accordingly, and always pays his debts; then, suddenly, he isconfronted with a demand that he pay a debt of his father’s, contracted beforehe was born—and he is given to understand that other demands will be sprung onhim, for the debts of his grandfather, his great-grandfather, etc. Would heaccept it? Would he remain decent, conscientious and hard-working? Or would heblow his savings on one drunken orgy, then drift at the whim of the moment,mooching and chiseling as best he can?The same is true in the realm of morality. Morality is inseparable from personalchoice and personal responsibility. If a man lives conscientiously according toa set of moral principles, then hears that his moral rectitude does not dependon his actions, but on the actions of his ancestors, he will not remain moralfor long. He will let himself slide into that cynical, senseless, hopeless graybog which is today’s culture, where floating shapes scowl at him menacingly andhoarse voices screech about “affirmative action.”No, men are not evil by nature—and when evil ideas take over a culture, twofactors are responsible: the absence of good ideas, and force. Just as financialinflation is caused by the government, so is moral inflation. The government isdestroying the people’s morality by many forms of injustice, which include suchthings as forcing racial quotas on schools and business concerns. As the TimesMagazine article explains in regard to the DeFunis case: “H.E.W [Department ofHealth, Education and Welfare] was leaning hard on the university for allegednoncompliance with affirmative action in campus hiring. The university, like2,500 other institutions of higher learning in the United States, holdsGovernment grants and contracts and thus is required by Federal law to institute‘goals and timetables’ for hiring more women and minorities on its faculty.” (Somuch for the notion of the government granting subsidies to education withoutstrings attached, i.e., without affecting the schools’ intellectual freedom.)The next time you hear a politician deplore the moral decline of this country,remember (and, perhaps, remind him) that if one wants to preserve a nation’smorality, one must set up conditions of existence in which moral behavior isrewarded, not punished—and that this cannot be done on an altruist basis: aftercenturies of moral inflation, the balloon of altruism has burst.014 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_014_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: This passage comes from an anthology of essays published underthe title The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution. (A new, expanded andrevised edition, retitled Return of the Primitive: The Anti-IndustrialRevolution will be published in 1999.) The excerpt identifies the fundamentalmotive that drives the moralists of altruism.THE AGE OF ENVYA CULTURE, like an individual, has a sense of life or, rather, the equivalent ofa sense of life—an emotional atmosphere created by its dominant philosophy, byits view of man and of existence. This emotional atmosphere represents aculture’s dominant values and serves as the leitmotif of a given age, settingits trends and its style.Thus Western civilization had an Age of Reason and an Age of Enlightenment. Inthose periods, the quest for reason and enlightenment was the dominantintellectual drive and created a corresponding emotional atmosphere thatfostered these values.Today, we live in the Age of Envy.“Envy” is not the emotion I have in mind, but it is the clearest manifestationof an emotion that has remained nameless; it is the only element of a complexemotional sum that men have permitted themselves to identify.Envy is regarded by most people as a petty, superficial emotion and, therefore,it serves as a semihuman cover for so inhuman an emotion that those who feel itseldom dare admit it even to themselves. Mankind has lived with it, has observedits manifestations and, to various extents, has been ravaged by it for countlesscenturies, yet has failed to grasp its meaning and to rebel against itsexponents.Today, that emotion is the leitmotif, the sense of life of our culture. It isall around us, we are drowning in it, it is almost explicitly confessed by itsmore brazen exponents—yet men continue to evade its existence and are peculiarlyafraid to name it, as primitive people were once afraid to pronounce the name ofthe devil.That emotion is: hatred of the good for being the good.This hatred is not resentment against some prescribed view of the good withwhich one does not agree. For instance, if a child resents some conventionaltype of obedient boy who is constantly held up to him as an ideal to emulate,this is not hatred of the good: the child does not regard that boy as good, andhis resentment is the product of a clash between his values and those of hiselders (though he is too young to grasp the issue in such terms). Similarly, ifan adult does not regard altruism as good and resents the adulation bestowedupon some “humanitarian,” this is a clash between his values and those ofothers, not hatred of the good.Hatred of the good for being the good means hatred of that which one regards asgood by one’s own (conscious or subconscious) judgment. It means hatred of aperson for possessing a value or virtue one regards as desirable.If a child wants to get good grades in school, but is unable or unwilling toachieve them and begins. to hate the children who do, that is hatred of thegood. If a man regards intelligence as a value, but is troubled by self-doubtand begins to hate the men he judges to be intelligent, that is hatred of thegood.The nature of the particular values a man chooses to hold is not the primaryfactor in this issue (although irrational values may contribute a great deal tothe formation of that emotion). The primary factor and distinguishingcharacteristic is an emotional mechanism set in reverse: a response of hatred,not toward human vices, but toward human virtues.To be exact, the emotional mechanism is not set in reverse, but is set one way:its exponents do not experience love for evil men; their emotional range islimited to hatred or indifference. It is impossible to experience love, which isa response to values, when one’s automatized response to values is hatred.In any specific instance, this type of hatred is heavily enmeshed inrationalizations. The most common one is: “I don’t hate him for hisintelligence, but for his conceit!” More often than not, if one asks the speakerto name the evidence of the victim’s conceit, he exhausts such generalities as:“He’s insolent ... he’s stubborn ... he’s selfish,” and ends up with someindeterminate accusation which amounts to: “He’s intelligent and he knows it.”Well, why shouldn’t he know it? Blank out. Should he hide it? Blank out. Fromwhom should he hide it? The implicit, but never stated, answer is: “From peoplelike me.”Yet such haters accept and even seem to admire the spectacle of conceit put onfor their benefit by a man who shows off, boasting about his own alleged virtuesor achievements, blatantly confessing a lack of self-confidence. This, ofcourse, is a clue to the nature of the hatred. The haters seem unable todifferentiate conceptually between “conceit” and a deserved pride, yet they seemto know the difference “instinctively,” i.e., by means of their automatizedsense of life.Since very few men have fully consistent characters, it is often hard to tell,in a specific instance, whether a given man is hated for his virtues or for hisactual flaws. In regard to one’s own feelings, only a rigorously conscientioushabit of introspection can enable one to be certain of the nature and causes ofone’s emotional responses. But introspection is the mental process most fiercelyavoided by the haters, which permits them a virtually unlimited choice ofrationalizations. In regard to judging the emotional responses of others, it isextremely difficult to tell their reasons in a specific case, particularly if itinvolves complex personal relationships. It is, therefore, in the broad,impersonal field of responses to strangers, to casual acquaintances, to publicfigures or to events that have no direct bearing on the haters’ own lives thatone can observe the hatred of the good in a pure, unmistakable form.Its clearest manifestation is the attitude of a person who characteristicallyresents someone’s success, happiness, achievement or good fortune—andexperiences pleasure at someone’s failure, unhappiness or misfortune. This ispure, “nonvenal” hatred of the good for being the good: the hater has nothing tolose or gain in such instances, no practical value at stake, no existentialmotive, no knowledge except the fact that a human being has succeeded or failed.The expressions of this response are brief, casual, as a rule involuntary. Butif you have seen it, you have seen the naked face of evil.Do not confuse this response with that of a person who resents someone’sunearned success, or feels pleased by someone’s deserved failure. Theseresponses are caused by a sense of justice, which is an entirely differentphenomenon, and its emotional manifestations are different: in such cases, aperson expresses indignation, not hatred—or relief, not malicious gloating.Superficially, the motive of those who hate the good is taken to be envy. Adictionary definition of envy is: “1. a sense of discontent or jealousy withregard to another’s advantages, success, possessions, etc. 2. desire for anadvantage possessed by another” (The Random House Dictionary, 1968). The samedictionary adds the following elucidation: “To envy is to feel resentful becausesomeone else possesses or has achieved what one wishes oneself to possess or tohave achieved.”This covers a great many emotional responses, which come from different motives.In a certain sense, the second definition is the opposite of the first, and themore innocent of the two.For example, if a poor man experiences a moment’s envy of another man’s wealth,the feeling may mean nothing more than a momentary concretization of his desirefor wealth; the feeling is not directed against that particular rich person andis concerned with the wealth, not the person. The feeling, in effect, may amountto: “I wish I had an income (or a house, or a car, or an overcoat) like his.”The result of this feeling may be an added incentive for the man to improve hisfinancial condition.The feeling is less innocent, if it involves personal resentment and amounts to:“I want to put on a front, like this man.” The result is a second-hander wholives beyond his means, struggling to “keep up with the Joneses.”The feeling is still less innocent, if it amounts to: “I want this man’s car (orovercoat, or diamond shirt studs, or industrial establishment).” The result is acriminal.But these are still human beings, in various stages of immorality, compared tothe inhuman object whose feeling is: “I hate this man because he is wealthy andI am not.”Envy is part of this creature’s feeling, but only the superficial,semirespectable part; it is like the tip of an iceberg showing nothing worsethan ice, but with the submerged part consisting of a compost of rotting livingmatter. The envy, in this case, is semirespectable because it seems to imply adesire for material possessions, which is a human being’s desire. But, deepdown, the creature has no such desire: it does not want to be rich, it wants thehuman being to be poor.This is particularly clear in the much more virulent cases of hatred, masked asenvy, for those who possess personal values or virtues: hatred for a man (or awoman) because he (or she) is beautiful or intelligent or successful or honestor happy. In these cases, the creature has no desire and makes no effort toimprove its appearance, to develop or to use its intelligence, to struggle forsuccess, to practice honesty, to be happy (nothing can make it happy). It knowsthat the disfigurement or the mental collapse or the failure or the immoralityor the misery of its victim would not endow it with his or her value. It doesnot desire the value: it desires the value’s destruction.“They do not want to own your fortune, they want you to lose it; they do notwant to succeed, they want you to fail; they do not want to live, they want youto die; they desire nothing, they hate existence ...” (Atlas Shrugged).What endows such a creature with a quality of abysmal evil is the fact that ithas an awareness of values and is able to recognize them in people. If it weremerely amoral, it would be indifferent; it would be unable to distinguishvirtues from flaws. But it does distinguish them—and the essentialcharacteristic of its corruption is the fact that its mind’s recognition of avalue is transmitted to its emotional mechanism as hatred, not as love, desireor admiration.Consider the full meaning of this attitude. Values are that which one acts togain and/or keep. Values are a necessity of man’s survival, and wider: of anyliving organism’s survival. Life is a process of self-sustaining andself-generated action, and the successful pursuit of values is a precondition ofremaining alive. Since nature does not provide man with an automatic knowledgeof the code of values he requires, there are differences in the codes which menaccept and the goals they pursue. But consider the abstraction “value,” apartfrom the particular content of any given code, and ask yourself: What is thenature of a creature in which the sight of a value arouses hatred and the desireto destroy? In the most profound sense of the term, such a creature is a killer,not a physical, but a metaphysical one—it is not an enemy of your values, but ofall values, it is an enemy of anything that enables men to survive, it is anenemy of life as such and of everything living.A community of values—of some sort of values—is a necessity of any successfulrelationship among living beings. If you were training an animal, you would nothurt it every time it obeyed you. If you were bringing up a child, you would notpunish him whenever he acted properly. What relationship can you have with thehating creatures, and what element do they introduce into social relationships?If you struggle for existence and find that your success brings you, notapproval and appreciation, but hatred, if you strive to be moral and find thatyour virtue brings you, not the love, but the hatred of your fellow-men, whatbecomes of your own benevolence? Will you be able to generate or to maintain afeeling of good will toward your fellow-men?The greatest danger in this issue is men’s inability—or worse:unwillingness—fully to identify it.Evil as the hating creatures are, there is something still more evil: those whotry to appease them.It is understandable that men might seek to hide their vices from the eyes ofpeople whose judgment they respect. But there are men who hide their virtuesfrom the eyes of monsters. There are men who apologize for their ownachievements, deride their own values, debase their own character—for the sakeof pleasing those they know to be stupid, corrupt, malicious, evil. Anobsequious pandering to the vanity of some alleged superior, such as a king, forthe sake of some practical advantage, is bad enough. But pandering to the vanityof one’s inferiors—inferior specifically in regard to the value involved—is soshameful an act of treason to one’s values that nothing can be left thereafterof the person who commits it, neither intellectually nor morally, and nothingever is.If men attempt to play up to those they admire, and fake virtues they do notpossess, it is futile, but understandable, if not justifiable. But to fakevices, weaknesses, flaws, disabilities? To shrink one’s soul and stature? Toplay down—or write down, or speak down, or think down?Observe just one social consequence of this policy: such appeasers do nothesitate to join some cause or other appealing for mercy; they never raise theirvoices in the name of justice.Cowardice is so ignoble an inner state that men struggle to overcome it, in theface of real dangers. The appeaser chooses a state of cowardice where no dangerexists. To live in fear is so unworthy a condition that men have died onbarricades, defying the tyranny of the mighty. The appeaser chooses to live inchronic fear of the impotent.Men have died in torture chambers, on the stake, in concentration camps, infront of firing squads, rather than renounce their convictions. The appeaserrenounces his under the pressure of a frown on any vacant face. Men have refusedto sell their souls in exchange for fame, fortune, power, even their own lives.The appeaser does not sell his soul: he gives it away for free, getting nothingin return.The appeaser’s usual rationalization is: “I don’t want to be disliked.” By whom?By people he dislikes, despises and condemns.Let me give you some examples. An intellectual who was recruiting members forMensa—an international society allegedly restricted to intelligent men, whichselects members on the dubious basis of I.Q. tests—was quoted in an interview asfollows: “Intelligence is not especially admired by people. Outside Mensa youhad to be very careful not to win an argument and lose a friend. Inside Mensa wecan be ourselves and that is a great relief” (The New York Times, September 11,1966). A friend, therefore, is more important than the truth. What kind offriend? The kind that resents you for being right.A professor, the head of a department in a large university, had a favoritegraduate student who wanted to be a teacher. The professor had tested him as aninstructor and regarded him as exceptionally intelligent. In a privateconversation with the young man’s parents, the professor praised him highly anddeclared: “There is only one danger in his future: he is such a good teacherthat the rest of the faculty will resent him.” When the young man got his Ph.D.,the professor did not offer him a job, even though he had the power to do so.The notion that an intelligent girl should hide her intelligence in order to bepopular with men and find a husband, is widespread and well-known. Of what valuewould such a husband be to her? Blank out.In an old movie dealing with college life, a boy asks a girl to help him getgood grades by means of an actually criminal scheme (it involves the theft of atest from the professor’s office). When she refuses, the boy asks scornfully:“Are you some sort of moralist?” “Oh, no, no,” she answers hastily andapologetically, “it’s just my small-town upbringing, I guess.”Do not confuse appeasement with tactfulness or generosity. Appeasement is notconsideration for the feelings of others, it is consideration for and compliancewith the unjust, irrational and evil feelings of others. It is a policy ofexempting the emotions of others from moral judgment, and of willingness tosacrifice innocent, virtuous victims to the evil malice of such emotions.Tactfulness is consideration extended only to rational feelings. A tactful mandoes not stress his success or happiness in the presence of those who havesuffered failure, loss or unhappiness; not because he suspects them of envy, butbecause he realizes that the contrast can revive and sharpen their pain. He doesnot stress his virtues in anyone’s presence: he takes for granted that they arerecognized. As a rule, a man of achievement does not flaunt his achievements,neither among equals nor inferiors nor superiors; he does not evaluatehimself—or others—by a comparative standard. His attitude is not: “I am betterthan you,” but: “I am good.”If, however, he encounters an envious hater who gets huffy, trying to ignore,deny or insult his achievements, he asserts them proudly. In answer to thehater’s stock question: “Who do you think you are?”—he tells him.It is the pretentious mediocrity—the show-off, the boaster, the snootyposturer—who seeks, not virtue or value, but superiority. A comparative standardis his only guide, which means that he has no standards and that he has a vestedinterest in reducing others to inferiority. Decent people, properly, resent ashow-off, but the haters and enviers do not: they recognize him as a soul mate.Offensive boasting or self-abasing appeasement is a false alternative. As in allhuman relationships, the guidelines of proper conduct are: objectivity andjustice. But this is not what men are taught or were taught in the past.“Use your head—but don’t let anyone know it. Set your goals high—but don’t admitit. Be honest—but don’t uphold it. Be successful—but hide it. Be great—but actsmall. Be happy—but God help you if you are!” Such are the moral injunctions wegather from the cultural atmosphere in which we grow up—as men did in the past,throughout history.The appeasement of evi!—of an unknowable, undefinable, inexplicable evil—hasbeen the undertow of mankind’s cultural stream all through the ages. Inprimitive cultures (and even in ancient Greece) the appeasement took the form ofthe belief that the gods resent human happiness or success, because these arethe prerogatives of the gods to which men must not aspire. Hence thesuperstitious fear of acknowledging one’s good fortune—as, for instance, theritual of parents wailing that their newborn son is puny, ugly, worthless, forfear that a demon would harm him if they admitted their happy pride in hishealth and looks. Observe the contradiction: Why attempt to deceive anomnipotent demon who would be able to judge the infant’s value for himself? Theintention of the ritual, therefore, is not: “Don’t let him know that the infantis good,” but: “Don’t let him know that you know it and that you’re happy!”Men create gods—and demons—in their own likeness; mystic fantasies, as a rule,are invented to explain some phenomenon for which men find no explanation. Thenotion of gods who are so malicious that they wish men to live in chronicmisery, would not be conceived or believed unless men sensed all around them thepresence of some inexplicable malevolence directed specifically at theirpersonal happiness.Are the haters of the good that numerous? No. The actual haters are a small,depraved minority in any age or culture. The spread and perpetuation of thisevil are accomplished by those who profiteer on it.The profiteers are men with a vested interest in mankind’s psychologicaldevastation, who burrow their way into positions of moral-intellectualleadership. They provide the haters with unlimited means of rationalization,dissimulation, excuse and camouflage, including ways of passing vices off asvirtues. They slander, confuse and disarm the victims. Their vested interest ispower-lust. Their stock-in-trade is any system of thought or of belief aimed atkeeping men small.Observe the nature of some of mankind’s oldest legends.Why were the men of Babel punished? Because they attempted to build a tower tothe sky.Why did Phaëthon perish? Because he attempted to drive the chariot of the sun.Why was Icarus smashed? Because he attempted to fly.Why was Arachne transformed into a spider? Because she challenged a goddess to acompetition in the art of weaving—and won it.“Do not aspire—do not venture—do not rise—ambition is self-destruction,” dronesthis ancient chorus through the ages—through all the ages, changing its lyrics,but not its tune—all the way to the Hollywood movies in which the boy who goesto seek a career in the big city becomes a wealthy, but miserable scoundrel,while the small-town boy who stays put wins the girl next door, who wins overthe glamorous temptress.There is and was abundant evidence to show that the curse of an overwhelmingmajority of men is passivity, lethargy and fear, not ambition and audacity. Butmen’s well-being is not the motive of that chorus.Toward the end of World War II, newspapers reported the following: when Russiantroops moved west and occupied foreign towns, the Soviet authoritiesautomatically executed any person who had a bank account of $100 or ahigh-school education; the rest of the inhabitants submitted. This is a physicaldramatization of the spiritual policy of mankind’s moral-intellectual leaders:destroy the tops, the rest will give up and obey.Just as a political dictator needs specially indoctrinated thugs to enforce hisorders, so his intellectual road-pavers need them to maintain their power. Theirthugs are the haters of the good; the special indoctrination is the morality ofaltruism.It is obvious—historically, philosophically and psychologically—that altruism isan inexhaustible source of rationalizations for the most evil motives, the mostinhuman actions, the most loathsome emotions. It is not difficult to grasp themeaning of the tenet that the good is an object of sacrifice—and to understandwhat a blanket damnation of anything living is represented by an undefinedaccusation of “selfishness.”But here is a significant phenomenon to observe: the haters and enviers—who arethe most vociferous shock troops of altruism—seem to be subconsciouslyimpervious to the altruist criterion of the good. The touchy vanity of thesehaters—which flares up at any suggestion of their inferiority to a man ofvirtue—is not aroused by any saint or hero of altruism, whose moral superioritythey profess to acknowledge. Nobody envies Albert Schweitzer. Whom do they envy?The man of intelligence, of ability, of achievement, of independence.If anyone ever believed (or tried to believe) that the motive of altruism iscompassion, that its goal is the relief of human suffering and the eliminationof poverty, the state of today’s culture now deprives him of any foothold onself-deception. Today, altruism is running amuck, shedding its tatteredrationalizations and displaying its soul.Altruists are no longer concerned with material wealth, not even with its“redistribution,” only with its destruction—but even this is merely a means toan end. Their savage fury is aimed at the destruction of intelligence—ofability, ambition, thought, purpose, justice; the destruction of morality, anysort of morality; the destruction of values qua values.The last fig leaf of academic pretentiousness is the tag used to disguise thismovement: egalitarianism. It does not disguise, but reveals.Egalitarianism means the belief in the equality of all men. If the word“equality” is to be taken in any serious or rational sense, the crusade for thisbelief is dated bv about a century or more: the United States of America hasmade it an anachronism—by establishing a system based on the principle ofindividual rights. “Equality,” in a human context, is a political term: it meansequality before the law, the equality of fundamental, inalienable rights whichevery man possesses by virtue of his birth as a human being, and which may notbe infringed or abrogated by man-made institutions, such as titles of nobilityor the division of men into castes established by law, with special privilegesgranted to some and denied to others. The rise of capitalism swept away allcastes, including the institutions of aristocracy and of slavery or serfdom.But this is not the meaning that the altruists ascribe to the word “equality.”They turn the word into an anti-concept: they use it to mean, not political, butmetaphysical equality—the equality of personal attributes and virtues,regardless of natural endowment or individual choice, performance and character.It is not man-made institutions, but nature, i.e., reality, that they propose tofight—by means of man-made institutions.Since nature does not endow all men with equal beauty or equal intelligence, andthe faculty of volition leads men to make different choices, the egalitarianspropose to abolish the “unfairness” of nature and of volition, and to establishuniversal equality in fact—in defiance of facts. Since the Law of Identity isimpervious to human manipulation, it is the Law of Causality that they struggleto abrogate. Since personal attributes or virtues cannot be “redistributed,”they seek to deprive men of their consequences—of the rewards, the benefits, theachievements created by personal attributes and virtues.It is not equality before the law that they seek, but inequality; theestablishment of an inverted social pyramid, with a new aristocracy on top—thearistocracy of non-value....015 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_015_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"3. Man, the Rational Animal A theory of ethics rests on a view of man’s nature. The first two selections,written in 1969 about the Apollo 11 mission (and its antithesis, Woodstock),capture AR’s distinctive view.The first of these, from the anthology The Voice of Reason, conveys her positivevision of man; the second, from Return of the Primitive, offers her analysis ofman’s greatest enemy.APOLLO 11“NO MATTER what discomforts and expenses you had to bear to come here,” said aNASA guide to a group of guests, at the conclusion of a tour of the Space Centeron Cape Kennedy, on July 15, 1969, “there will be seven minutes tomorrow morningthat will make you feel it was worth it.”It was.The tour had been arranged for the guests invited by NASA to attend thelaunching of Apollo 11. As far as I was able to find out, the guests—apart fromgovernment officials and foreign dignitaries—were mainly scientists,industrialists, and a few intellectuals who had been selected to represent theAmerican people and culture on this occasion. If this was the standard ofselection, I am happy and proud that I was one of these guests.The NASA tour guide was a slight, stocky, middle-aged man who wore glasses andspoke—through a microphone, at the front of the bus—in the mild, gentle, patientmanner of a schoolteacher. He reminded me of television’s Mr. Peepers—until hetook off his glasses and I took a closer look at his face: he had unusual,intensely intelligent eyes.The Space Center is an enormous place that looks like an untouched wildernesscut, incongruously, by a net of clean, new, paved roads: stretches of wild,subtropical growth, an eagle’s nest in a dead tree, an alligator in a stagnantmoat—and, scattered at random, in the distance, a few vertical shafts risingfrom the jungle, slender structures of a shape peculiar to the technology ofspace, which do not belong to the age of the jungle or even fully to ours.The discomfort was an inhuman, brain-melting heat. The sky was a sunless spreadof glaring white, and the physical objects seemed to glare so that the meresensation of sight became an effort. We kept plunging into an oven, when the busstopped and we ran to modern, air-conditioned buildings that looked quietlyunobtrusive and militarily efficient, then plunging back into theair-conditioned bus as into a pool. Our guide kept talking and explaining,patiently, courteously, conscientiously, but his heart was not in it, andneither was ours, even though the things he showed us would have beenfascinating at any other time. The reason was not the heat; it was as if nothingcould register on us, as if we were out of focus, or, rather, focused toointently and irresistibly on the event of the following day.It was the guide who identified it, when he announced: “And now we’ll show youwhat you really want to see”—and we were driven to the site of Apollo 11.The “VIP’s” tumbled out of the bus like tourists and rushed to photograph oneanother, with the giant rocket a few hundred yards away in the background. Butsome just stood and looked.I felt a kind of awe, but it was a purely theoretical awe; I had to remindmyself: “This is it,” in order to experience any emotion. Visually it was justanother rocket, the kind you can see in any science-fiction movie or on any toycounter: a tall, slender shape of dead, powdery white against the white glare ofthe sky and the steel lacing of the service tower. There were sharp black linesencircling the white body at intervals—and our guide explained matter-of-factlythat these marked the stages that would be burned off in tomorrow’s firings.This made the meaning of the rocket more real for an instant. But the fact thatthe lunar module, as he told us, was already installed inside the small, slantedpart way on top of the rocket, just under the still smaller, barely visiblespacecraft itself, would not become fully real; it seemed too small, too faraway from us, and, simultaneously, too close: I could not quite integrate itwith the parched stubble of grass under our feet, with its wholesomely usualtouches of litter, with the psychedelic colors of the shirts on the touristssnapping pictures.Tomorrow, our guide explained, we would be sitting on bleachers three milesaway; he warned us that the sound of the blast would reach us some seconds laterthan the sight, and assured us that it would be loud, but not unbearable.I do not know that guide’s actual work at the Space Center, and I do not know bywhat imperceptible signs he gave me the impression that he was a man in lovewith his work. It was only that concluding remark of his, later, at the end ofthe tour, that confirmed my impression. In a certain way, he set, for me, thetone of the entire occasion: the sense of what lay under the surface of theseemingly commonplace activities.My husband and I were staying in Titusville, a tiny frontier settlement—thefrontier of science—built and inhabited predominantly by the Space Center’semployees. It was just like any small town, perhaps a little newer andcleaner—except that ten miles away, across the bluish spread of the IndianRiver, one could see the foggy, bluish, rectangular shape of the Space Center’slargest structure, the Vehicle Assembly Building, and, a little farther away,two faint vertical shafts: Apollo 11 and its service tower. No matter what onelooked at in that town, one could not really see anything else.I noticed only that Titusville had many churches, too many, and that they hadincredible, modernistic forms. Architecturally, they reminded me of the moreextreme types of Hollywood drive-ins: a huge, cone-shaped roof, with practicallyno walls to support it—or an erratic conglomeration of triangles, like a coralbush gone wild—or a fairy-tale candy-house, with S-shaped windows dripping atrandom like gobs of frosting. I may be mistaken about this, but I had theimpression that here, on the doorstep of the future, religion felt out of placeand this was the way it was trying to be modern.Since all the motels of Titusville were crowded beyond capacity, we had rented aroom in a private home: as their contribution to the great event, many of thelocal homeowners had volunteered to help their chamber of commerce with theunprecedented flood of visitors. Our room was in the home of an engineeremployed at the Space Center. It was a nice, gracious family, and one might havesaid a typical small-town family, except for one thing: a quality of cheerfulopenness, directness, almost innocence—the benevolent, unselfconsciouslyself-confident quality of those who live in the clean, strict, reality-orientedatmosphere of science.On the morning of July 16, we got up at 3 A.M. in order to reach the NASA GuestCenter by 6 A.M., a distance that a car traveled normally in ten minutes.(Special buses were to pick up the guests at that Center, for the trip to thelaunching.) But Titusville was being engulfed by such a flood of cars that eventhe police traffic department could not predict whether one would be able tomove through the streets that morning. We reached the Guest Center long beforesunrise, thanks to the courtesy of our hostess, who drove us there throughtwisting back streets.On the shore of the Indian River, we saw cars, trucks, trailers filling everyfoot of space on both sides of the drive, in the vacant lots, on the lawns, onthe river’s sloping embankment. There were tents perched at the edge of thewater; there were men and children sleeping on the roofs of station wagons, inthe twisted positions of exhaustion; I saw a half-naked man asleep in a hammockstrung between a car and a tree. These people had come from all over the countryto watch the launching across the river, miles away. (We heard later that thesame patient, cheerful human flood had spread through all the small communitiesaround Cape Kennedy that night, and that it numbered one million persons.) Icould not understand why these people would have such an intense desire towitness just a few brief moments; some hours later, I understood it.It was still dark as we drove along the river. The sky and the water were asolid spread of dark blue that seemed soft, cold, and empty. But, framed by themotionless black leaves of the trees on the embankment, two things marked offthe identity of the sky and the earth: far above in the sky, there was a single,large star; and on earth, far across the river, two enormous sheaves of whitelight stood shooting motionlessly into the empty darkness from two tiny uprightshafts of crystal that looked like glowing icicles; they were Apollo 11 and itsservice tower.It was dark when a caravan of buses set out at 7 A.M. on the journey to theSpace Center. The light came slowly, beyond the steam-veiled windows, as wemoved laboriously through back streets and back roads. No one asked anyquestions; there was a kind of tense solemnity about that journey, as if we werecaught in the backwash of the enormous discipline of an enormous purpose andwere now carried along on the power of an invisible authority.It was full daylight—a broiling, dusty, hazy daylight—when we stepped out of thebuses. The launch site looked big and empty like a desert; the bleachers, madeof crude, dried planks, seemed small, precariously fragile and irrelevant, likea hasty footnote. Three miles away, the shaft of Apollo 11 looked a dusty whiteagain, like a tired cigarette planted upright.The worst part of the trip was that last hour and a quarter, which we spentsitting on wooden planks in the sun. There was a crowd of seven thousand peoplefilling the stands, there was the cool, clear, courteous voice of a loudspeakerrasping into sound every few minutes, keeping us informed of the progress of thecountdown (and announcing, somewhat dutifully, the arrival of some prominentgovernment personage, which did not seem worth the effort of turning one’s headto see), but all of it seemed unreal. The full reality was only the vast emptyspace, above and below, and the tired white cigarette in the distance.The sun was rolling up and straight at our faces, like a white ball wrapped indirty cotton. But beyond the haze, the sky was clear—which meant that we wouldbe able to see the whole of the launching, including the firing of the secondand third stages.Let me warn you that television does not give any idea of what we saw. Later, Isaw that launching again on color television, and it did not resemble theoriginal.The loudspeaker began counting the minutes when there were only five left. WhenI heard: “Three-quarters of a minute,” I was up, standing on the wooden bench,and do not remember hearing the rest.It began with a large patch of bright, yellow-orange flame shooting sidewaysfrom under the base of the rocket. It looked like a normal kind of flame and Ifelt an instant’s shock of anxiety, as if this were a building on fire. In thenext instant the flame and the rocket were hidden by such a sweep of dark redfire that the anxiety vanished: this was not part of any normal experience andcould not be integrated with anything. The dark red fire parted into twogigantic wings, as if a hydrant were shooting streams of fire outward and up,toward the zenith—and between the two wings, against a pitch-black sky, therocket rose slowly, so slowly that it seemed to hang still in the air, a palecylinder with a blinding oval of white light at the bottom, like an upturnedcandle with its flame directed at the earth. Then I became aware that this washappening in total silence, because I heard the cries of birds wingingfrantically away from the flames. The rocket was rising faster, slanting alittle, its tense white flame leaving a long, thin spiral of bluish smoke behindit. It had risen into the open blue sky, and the dark red fire had turned intoenormous billows of brown smoke, when the sound reached us: it was a long,violent crack, not a rolling sound, but specifically a cracking, grinding sound,as if space were breaking apart, but it seemed irrelevant and unimportant,because it was a sound from the past and the rocket was long since speedingsafely out of its reach—though it was strange to realize that only a few secondshad passed. I found myself waving to the rocket involuntarily, I heard peopleapplauding and joined them, grasping our common motive; it was impossible towatch passively, one had to express, by some physical action, a feeling that wasnot triumph, but more: the feeling that that white object’s unobstructed streakof motion was the only thing that mattered in the universe. The rocket wasalmost above our heads when a sudden flare of yellow-gold fire seemed to envelopit—I felt a stab of anxiety, the thought that something had gone wrong, thenheard a burst of applause and realized that this was the firing of the secondstage. When the loud, space-cracking sound reached us, the fire had turned intoa small puff of white vapor floating away. At the firing of the third stage, therocket was barely visible; it seemed to be shrinking and descending; there was abrief spark, a white puff of vapor, a distant crack—and when the white puffdissolved, the rocket was gone.These were the seven minutes.What did one feel afterward? An abnormal, tense overconcentration on thecommonplace necessities of the immediate moment, such as stumbling over patchesof rough gravel, running to find the appropriate guest bus. One had tooverconcentrate, because one knew that one did not give a damn about anything,because one had no mind and no motivation left for any immediate action. How doyou descend from a state of pure exaltation?What we had seen, in naked essentials—but in reality, not in a work of art—wasthe concretized abstraction of man’s greatness.The meaning of the sight lay in the fact that when those dark red wings of fireflared open, one knew that one was not looking at a normal occurrence, but at acataclysm which, if unleashed by nature, would have wiped man out ofexistence—and one knew also that this cataclysm was planned, unleashed, andcontrolled by man, that this unimaginable power was ruled by his power and,obediently serving his purpose, was making way for a slender, rising craft. Oneknew that this spectacle was not the product of inanimate nature, like someaurora borealis, or of chance, or of luck, that it was unmistakably human—with“human,” for once, meaning grandeur—that a purpose and a long, sustained,disciplined effort had gone to achieve this series of moments, and that man wassucceeding, succeeding, succeeding! For once, if only for seven minutes, theworst among those who saw it had to feel—not “How small is man by the side ofthe Grand Canyon!”—but “How great is man and how safe is nature when he conquersit!”That we had seen a demonstration of man at his best, no one could doubt—this wasthe cause of the event’s attraction and of the stunned, numbed state in which itleft us. And no one could doubt that we had seen an achievement of man in hiscapacity as a rational being—an achievement of reason, of logic, of mathematics,of total dedication to the absolutism of reality. How many people would connectthese two facts, I do not know.The next four days were a period torn out of the world’s usual context, like abreathing spell with a sweep of clean air piercing mankind’s lethargicsuffocation. For thirty years or longer, the newspapers had featured nothing butdisasters, catastrophes, betrayals, the shrinking stature of men, the sordidmess of a collapsing civilization; their voice had become a long, sustainedwhine, the megaphone of failure, like the sound of an oriental bazaar whereleprous beggars, of spirit or matter, compete for attention by displaying theirsores. Now, for once, the newspapers were announcing a human achievement, werereporting on a human triumph, were reminding us that man still exists andfunctions as man.Those four days conveyed the sense that we were watching a magnificent work ofart—a play dramatizing a single theme: the efficacy of man’s mind. One afteranother, the crucial, dangerous maneuvers of Apollo 11’s fight were carried outaccording to plan, with what appeared to be an effortless perfection. Theyreached us in the form of brief, rasping sounds relayed from space to Houstonand from Houston to our television screens, sounds interspersed withcomputerized figures, translated for us by commentators who, for once, bycontagion, lost their usual manner of snide equivocation and spoke withcompelling clarity.The most confirmed evader in the worldwide audience could not escape the factthat these sounds announced events taking place far beyond the earth’satmosphere—that while he moaned about his loneliness and “alienation” and fearof entering an unknown cocktail party, three men were floating in a fragilecapsule in the unknown darkness and loneliness of space, with earth and moonsuspended like little tennis balls behind and ahead of them, and with theirlives suspended on the microscopic threads connecting numbers on their computerpanels in consequence of the invisible connections made well in advance by man’sbrain—that the more effortless their performance appeared, the more itproclaimed the magnitude of the effort expended to project it and achieveit—that no feelings, wishes, urges, instincts, or lucky “conditioning,” eitherin these three men or in all those behind them, from highest thinker to lowliestlaborer who touched a bolt of that spacecraft, could have achieved thisincomparable feat—that we were watching the embodied concretization of a singlefaculty of man: his rationality.There was an aura of triumph about the entire mission of Apollo 11, from theperfect launch to the climax. An assurance of success was growing in the wake ofthe rocket through the four days of its moon-bound flight. No, not becausesuccess was guaranteed—it is never guaranteed to man—but because a progressionof evidence was displaying the precondition of success: these men know what’theyare doing.No event in contemporary history was as thrilling, here on earth, as threemoments of the mission’s climax: the moment when, superimposed over the image ofa garishly colored imitation-module standing motionless on the televisionscreen, there flashed the words: “Lunar module has landed”—the moment when thefaint, gray shape of the actual module came shivering from the moon to thescreen—and the moment when the shining white blob which was Neil Armstrong tookhis immortal first step. At this last, I felt one instant of unhappy fear,wondering what he would say, because he had it in his power to destroy themeaning and the glory of that moment, as the astronauts of Apollo 8 had done intheir time. He did not. He made no reference to God; he did not undercut therationality of his achievement by paying tribute to the forces of its opposite;he spoke of man. “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.”So it was.As to my personal reaction to the entire mission of Apollo 11, I can express itbest by paraphrasing a passage from Atlas Shrugged that kept coming back to mymind: “Why did I feel that joyous sense of confidence while watching themission? In all of its giant course, two aspects pertaining to the inhuman wereradiantly absent: the causeless and the purposeless. Every part of the missionwas an embodied answer to ‘Why?’ and ‘What for?’—like the steps of a life-coursechosen by the sort of mind I worship. The mission was a moral code enacted inspace.”Now, coming back to earth (as it is at present), I want to answer briefly somequestions that will arise in this context. Is it proper for the government toengage in space projects? No, it is not—except insofar as space projects involvemilitary aspects, in which case, and to that extent, it is not merely proper butmandatory. Scientific research as such, however, is not the proper province ofthe government.But this is a political issue; it pertains to the money behind the lunar missionor to the method of obtaining that money, and to the project’s administration;it does not affect the nature of the mission as such, it does not alter the factthat this was a superlative technological achievement.In judging the effectiveness of the various elements involved in any large-scaleundertaking of a mixed economy, one must be guided by the question: whichelements were the result of coercion and which the result of freedom? It is notcoercion, not the physical force or threat of a gun, that created Apollo 11. Thescientists, the technologists, the engineers, the astronauts were free menacting of their own choice. The various parts of the spacecraft were produced byprivate industrial concerns. Of all human activities, science is the field leastamenable to force: the facts of reality do not take orders. (This is one of thereasons why science perishes under dictatorships, though technology may survivefor a short while.)It is said that without the “unlimited” resources of the government, such anenormous project would not have been undertaken. No, it would not have been—atthis time. But it would have been, when the economy was ready for it. There is aprecedent for this situation. The first transcontinental railroad of the UnitedStates was built by order of the government, on government subsidies. It washailed as a great achievement (which, in some respects, it was). But it causedeconomic dislocations and political evils, for the consequences of which we arepaying to this day in many forms.If the government deserves any credit for the space program, it is only to theextent that it did not act as a government, i.e., did not use coercion in regardto its participants (which it used in regard to its backers, i.e., thetaxpayers). And what is relevant in this context (but is not to be taken as ajustification or endorsement of a mixed economy) is the fact that of all ourgovernment programs, the space program is the cleanest and best: it, at least,has brought the American citizens a return on their forced investment, it hasworked for its money, it has earned its keep, which cannot be said about anyother program of the government.There is, however, a shameful element in the ideological motivation (or thepublicly alleged motivation) that gave birth to our space program: John FKennedy’s notion of a space competition between the United States and SovietRussia.A competition presupposes some basic principles held in common by all thecompetitors, such as the rules of the game in athletics, or the functions of thefree market in business. The notion of a competition between the United Statesand Soviet Russia in any field whatsoever is obscene: they are incommensurableentities, intellectually and morally. What would you think of a competitionbetween a doctor and a murderer to determine who could affect the greatestnumber of people? Or: a competition between Thomas A. Edison and Al Capone tosee who could get rich quicker?The fundamental significance of Apollo 11’s triumph is not political; it isphilosophical; specifically, moral-epistemological.The lunar landing as such was not a milestone of science, but of technology.Technology is an applied science, i.e., it translates the discoveries oftheoretical science into practical application to man’s life. As such,technology is not the first step in the development of a given body ofknowledge, but the last; it is not the most difficult step, but it is theultimate step, the implicit purpose, of man’s quest for knowledge.The lunar landing was not the greatest achievement of science, but its greatestvisible result. The greatest achievements of science are invisible: they takeplace in a man’s mind; they occur in the form of a connection integrating abroad range of phenomena. The astronaut of an earlier mission who remarked thathis spacecraft was driven by Sir Isaac Newton understood this issue. (And if Imay be permitted to amend that remark, I would say that Sir Isaac Newton was thecopilot of the flight; the pilot was Aristotle.) In this sense, the lunarlanding was a first step, a beginning, in regard to the moon, but it was a laststep, an end product, in regard to the earth—the end product of a long,intellectual-scientific development.This does not diminish in any way the intellectual stature, power, orachievement of the technologists and the astronauts; it merely indicates thatthey were the worthy recipients of an illustrious heritage, who made full use ofit by the exercise of their own individual ability. (The fact that man is theonly species capable of transmitting knowledge and thus capable of progress, thefact that man can achieve a division of labor, and the fact that large numbersof men are required for a large-scale undertaking, do not mean what some creepsare suggesting: that achievement has become collective.)I am not implying that all the men who contributed to the flight of Apollo 11were necessarily rational in every aspect of their lives or convictions. But intheir various professional capacities—each to the extent that he did contributeto the mission—they had to act on the principle of strict rationality.The most inspiring aspect of Apollo 11’s flight was that it made suchabstractions as rationality, knowledge, science perceivable in direct, immediateexperience. That it involved a landing on another celestial body was like adramatist’s emphasis on the dimensions of reason’s power: it is not of enormousimportance to most people that man lands on the moon, but that man can do it,is.This was the cause of the world’s response to the flight of Apollo 11.Frustration is the leitmotif in the lives of most men, particularly today—thefrustration of inarticulate desires, with no knowledge of the means to achievethem. In the sight and hearing of a crumbling world, Apollo 11 enacted the storyof an audacious purpose, its execution, its triumph, and the means that achievedit—the story and the demonstration of man’s highest potential. Whatever hisparticular ability or goal, if a man is not to give up his struggle, he needsthe reminder that success is possible; if he is not to regard the human specieswith fear, contempt, or hatred, he needs the spiritual fuel of knowing that manthe hero is possible.This was the meaning and the unidentified motive of the millions of eager,smiling faces that looked up to the flight of Apollo 11 from all over theremnants and ruins of the civilized world. This was the meaning that peoplesensed, but did not know in conscious terms—and will give up or betray tomorrow.It was the job of their teachers, the intellectuals, to tell them. But it is notwhat they are being told.A great event is like an explosion that blasts off pretenses and brings thehidden out to the surface, be it diamonds or muck. The flight of Apollo 11 was“a moment of truth”: it revealed an abyss between the physical sciences and thehumanities that has to be measured in terms of interplanetary distances. If theachievements of the physical sciences have to be watched through a telescope,the state of the humanities requires a microscope: there is no historicalprecedent for the smallness of stature and shabbiness of mind displayed bytoday’s intellectuals.In The New York Times of July 21, 1969, there appeared two whole pages devotedto an assortment of reactions to the lunar landing, from all kinds of prominentand semi-prominent people who represent a cross-section of our culture.It was astonishing to see how many ways people could find to utter variants ofthe same bromides. Under an overwhelming air of staleness, of pettiness, ofmusty meanness, the collection revealed the naked essence (and spiritualconsequences) of the basic premises ruling today’s culture:irrationalism-altruism-collectivism.The extent of the hatred for reason was somewhat startling. (And,psychologically, it gave the show away: one does not hate that which onehonestly regards as ineffectual.) It was, however, expressed indirectly, in theform of denunciations of technology. (And since technology is the means ofbringing the benefits of science to man’s life, judge for yourself the motiveand the sincerity of the protestations of concern with human suffering.)“But the chief reason for assessing the significance of the moon landingnegatively, even while the paeans of triumph are sung, is that this tremendoustechnical achievement represents a defective sense of human values, and of asense of priorities of our technical culture.” “We are betraying our moralweakness in our very triumphs in technology and economics.” “How can this nationswell and stagger with technological pride when it is so weak, so wicked, soblinded and misdirected in its priorities? While we can send men to the moon ordeadly missiles to Moscow or toward Mao, we can’t get foodstuffs across town tostarving folks in the teeming ghettos.” “Are things more important than people?I simply do not believe that a program comparable to the moon landing cannot beprojected around poverty, the war, crime, and so on.” “If we show the samedetermination and willingness to commit our resources, we can master theproblems of our cities just as we have mastered the challenge of space.” “Inthis regard, the contemporary triumphs of man’s mind—his ability to translatehis dreams of grandeur into awesome accomplishments—are not to be equated withprogress, as defined in terms of man’s primary concern with the welfare of themasses of fellow human beings ... the power of human intelligence which wasmobilized to accomplish this feat can also be mobilized to address itself to theultimate acts of human compassion.” “But, the most wondrous event would be ifman could relinquish all the stains and defilements of the untamed mind....”There was one entirely consistent person in that collection, Pablo Picasso,whose statement, in full, was: “It means nothing to me. I have no opinion aboutit, and I don’t care.” His work has been demonstrating that for years.The best statement was, surprisingly, that of the playwright Eugene lonesco, whowas perceptive about the nature of his fellow intellectuals. He said, in part:It’s an extraordinary event of incalculable importance. The sign that it’s soimportant is that most people aren’t interested in it. They go on discussingriots and strikes and sentimental affairs. The perspectives opened up areenormous, and the absence of interest shows an astonishing lack of goodwill. Ihave the impression that writers and intellectuals—men of the left—are turningtheir backs to the event.This is an honest statement—and the only pathetic (or terrible) thing about itis the fact that the speaker has not observed that “men of the left” are not“most people.”Now consider the exact, specific meaning of the evil revealed in thatcollection: it is the moral significance of Apollo 11 that is being ignored; itis the moral stature of the astronauts—and of all the men behind them, and ofall achievement—that is being denied. Think of what was required to achieve thatmission: think of the unself-pitying effort; the merciless discipline; thecourage; the responsibility of relying on one’s judgment; the days, nights andyears of unswerving dedication to a goal; the tension of the unbrokenmaintenance of a full, clear mental focus; and the honesty (honesty means:loyalty to truth, and truth means: the recognition of reality). All these arenot regarded as virtues by the altruists and are treated as of no moralsignificance.Now perhaps you will grasp the infamous inversion represented by the morality ofaltruism.Some people accused me of exaggeration when I said that altruism does not meanmere kindness or generosity, but the sacrifice of the best among men to theworst, the sacrifice of virtues to flaws, of ability to incompetence, ofprogress to stagnation—and the subordinating of all life and of all values tothe claims of anyone’s suffering.You have seen it enacted in reality.What else is the meaning of the brazen presumption of those who protest againstthe mission of Apollo 11, demanding that the money (which is not theirs) bespent, instead, on the relief of poverty?This is not an old-fashioned protest against mythical tycoons who “exploit”their workers, it is not a protest against the rich, it is not a protest againstidle luxury, it is not a plea for some marginal charity, for money that “no onewould miss.” It is a protest against science and progress, it is the impertinentdemand that man’s mind cease to function, that man’s ability be denied the meansto move forward, that achievement stop—because the poor hold a first mortgage onthe lives of their betters.By their own assessment, by demanding that the public support them, theseprotesters declare that they have not produced enough to support themselves—yetthey present a claim on the men whose ability produced so enormous a result asApollo 11, declaring that it was done at their expense, that the money behind itwas taken from them. Led by their spiritual equivalents and spokesmen, theyassert a private right to public funds, while denying the public (i.e., the restof us) the right to any higher, better purpose.I could remind them that without the technology they damn, there would be nomeans to support them. I could remind them of the pretechnological centurieswhen men subsisted in such poverty that they were unable to feed themselves, letalone give assistance to others. I could say that anyone who used one-hundredthof the mental effort used by the smallest of the technicians responsible forApollo 11 would not be consigned to permanent poverty, not in a free or evensemi-free society. I could say it, but I won’t. It is not their practice that Ichallenge, but their moral premise. Poverty is not a mortgage on the labor ofothers—misfortune is not a mortgage on achievement—failure is not a mortgage onsuccess—suffering is not a claim check, and its relief is not the goal ofexistence—man is not a sacrificial animal on anyone’s altar or for anyone’scause—life is not one huge hospital.Those who suggest that we substitute a war on poverty for the space programshould ask themselves whether the premises and values that form the character ofan astronaut would be satisfied by a lifetime of carrying bedpans and teachingthe alphabet to the mentally retarded. The answer applies as well to the valuesand premises of the astronauts’ admirers. Slums are not a substitute for stars.[...] As far as “national priorities” are concerned, I want to say the following: wedo not have to have a mixed economy, we still have a chance to change our courseand thus to survive. But if we do continue down the road of a mixed economy,then let them pour all the millions and billions they can into the spaceprogram. If the United States is to commit suicide, let it not be for the sakeand support of the worst human elements, the parasites-on-principle, at home andabroad. Let it not be its only epitaph that it died paying its enemies for itsown destruction. Let some of its lifeblood go to the support of achievement andthe progress of science. The American flag on the moon—or on Mars, or onJupiter—will, at least, be a worthy monument to what had once been a greatcountry.016 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_016_r1.jpg]APOLLO AND DIONYSUSON JULY 16, 1969, one million people, from all over the country, converged onCape Kennedy, Florida, to witness the launching of Apollo 11 that carriedastronauts to the moon.On August 15, 300,000 people, from all over the country, converged on Bethel,New York, near the town of Woodstock, to witness a rock music festival.These two events were news, not philosophical theory. These were facts of ouractual existence, the kinds of facts—according to both modern philosophers andpractical businessmen—that philosophy has nothing to do with.But if one cares to understand the meaning of these two events—to grasp theirroots and their consequences—one will understand the power of philosophy andlearn to recognize the specific forms in which philosophical abstractions appearin our actual existence.The issue in this case is the alleged dichotomy of reason versus emotion.This dichotomy has been presented in many variants in the history of philosophy,but its most colorfully eloquent statement was given by Friedrich Nietzsche. InThe Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music, Nietzsche claims that he observedtwo opposite elements in Greek tragedies, which he saw as metaphysicalprinciples inherent in the nature of reality; he named them after two Greekgods: Apollo, the god of light, and Dionysus, the god of wine. Apollo, inNietzsche’s metaphysics, is the symbol of beauty, order, wisdom, efficacy(though Nietzsche equivocates about this last)—i.e., the symbol of reason.Dionysus is the symbol of drunkenness or, rather, Nietzsche cites drunkenness ashis identification of what Dionysus stands for: wild, primeval feelings,orgiastic joy, the dark, the savage, the unintelligible element in man—i.e. thesymbol of emotion.Apollo, according to Nietzsche, is a necessary element, but an unreliable andthus inferior guide to existence, that gives man a superficial view of reality:the illusion of an orderly universe. Dionysus is the free, unfettered spiritthat offers man—by means of a mysterious intuition induced by wine and drugs—amore profound vision of a different kind of reality, and is thus the superior.And—indicating that Nietzsche knew clearly what he was talking about, eventhough he chose to express it in a safely, drunkenly Dionysian manner—Apollorepresents the principle of individuality, while Dionysus leads man “intocomplete self-forgetfulness” and into merging with the “Oneness” of nature.(Those who, at a superficial reading, take Nietzsche to be an advocate ofindividualism, please note.)This much is true: reason is the faculty of an individual, to be exercisedindividually; and it is only dark, irrational emotions, obliterating his mind,that can enable a man to melt, merge and dissolve into a mob or a tribe. We mayaccept Nietzsche’s symbols, but not his estimate of their respective values, northe metaphysical necessity of a reason-emotion dichotomy.It is not true that reason and emotion are irreconcilable antagonists or thatemotions are a wild, unknowable, ineffable element in men. But this is whatemotions become for those who do not care to know what they feel, and whoattempt to subordinate reason to their emotions. For every variant of suchattempts—as well as for their consequences—the image of Dionysus is anappropriate symbol.Symbolic figures are a valuable adjunct to philosophy: they help men tointegrate and bear in mind the essential meaning of complex issues. Apollo andDionysus represent the fundamental conflict of our age. And for those who mayregard them as floating abstractions, reality has offered two perfect,fiction-like dramatizations of these abstract symbols: at Cape Kennedy and atWoodstock. They were perfect in every respect demanded of serious fiction: theyconcretized the essentials of the two principles involved, in action, in a pure,extreme, isolated form. The fact that the spacecraft was called “Apollo” ismerely a coincidence, but a helpful coincidence.If you want to know fully what the conflict of reason versus irrational emotionmeans—in fact, in reality, on earth—keep these two events in mind: it meansApollo 11 versus the Woodstock festival. Remember also that you are asked tomake a choice between these two—and that the whole weight of today’s culture isbeing used to push you to the side of and into Woodstock’s mud. [...] One of the paradoxes of our age is the fact that the intellectuals, thepoliticians and all the sundry voices that choke, like asthma, the throat of ourcommunications media have never gasped and stuttered so loudly about theirdevotion to the public good and about the people’s will as the supreme criterionof value—and never have they been so grossly indifferent to the people. Thereason, obviously, is that collectivist slogans serve as a rationalization forthose who intend, not to follow the people, but to rule it. There is, however, adeeper reason: the most profound breach in this country is not between the richand the poor, but between the people and the intellectuals. In their view oflife, the American people are predominantly Apollonian; the “mainstream”intellectuals are Dionysian.This means: the people are reality-oriented, common-sense-oriented,technology-oriented (the intellectuals call this “materialistic” and“middle-class”); the intellectuals are emotion-oriented and seek, in panic, anescape from a reality they are unable to deal with, and from a technologicalcivilization that ignores their feelings.The flight of Apollo 11 brought this out into the open. With rare exceptions,the intellectuals resented its triumph. A two-page survey of their reactions,published by The New York Times on July 21, was an almost unanimous spread ofdenigrations and denunciations. (See my article “Apollo 11.”) What theydenounced was “technology”; what they resented was achievement and its source:reason. The same attitude—with rare exceptions—was displayed by the popularcommentators, who are not the makers, but the products and the weather vanes ofthe prevailing intellectual trends.Walter Cronkite of CBS was a notable exception. But Eric Sevareid of CBS wastypical of the trend. On July 15, the eve of the launching, he broadcast fromCape Kennedy a commentary that was reprinted in Variety (July 23, 1969). “InWashington and elsewhere,” he said, “the doubts concern future flights, theirnumber, their cost and their benefits, as if the success of Apollo 11 werealready assured. We are a people who hate failure. It’s un-American. It is afair guess that failure of Apollo 11 would not curtail future space programs butre-energize them.”Please consider these two sentences: “We are a people who hate failure. It’sun-American.” (In the context of the rest, this was not intended as acompliment, though it should have been; it was intended as sarcasm.) Who doesn’thate failure? Should one love it? Is there a nation on earth that doesn’t hateit? Surely, one would have to say that failure is un-British or un-French orun-Chinese. I can think of only one nation to whom this would not apply: failureis not un-Russian (in a sense which is deeper than politics).But what Mr. Sevareid had in mind was not failure. It was the Americandedication to success that he was deriding. It is true that no other nation as awhole is as successful as America, which is America’s greatest virtue. Butsuccess is never automatically immediate; passive resignation is not a typicalAmerican trait; Americans seldom give up. It is this precondition of success—the“try, try again” precept—that Mr. Sevareid was undercutting.He went on to say that if Apollo 11 succeeded, “the pressure to divert thesegreat sums of money to inner space, terra firma and inner man will steadilygrow.” He went on to discuss the views of men who believe “that this adventure,however majestic its drama, is only one more act of escape, that it is man onceagain running away from himself and his real needs, that we are approaching thebright side of the moon with the dark side of ourselves.... We know that thehuman brain will soon know more about the composition of the moon than it knowsabout the human brain ... [and] why human beings do what they do.”This last sentence is true, and one would think that the inescapable conclusionis that man should use his brain to study human nature by the same rationalmethods he has used so successfully to study inanimate matter. But not accordingto Mr. Sevareid; he reached a different conclusion: “It is possible that thedivine spark in man will consume him in flames, that the big brain will proveour ultimate flaw, like the dinosaur’s big body, that the metal plaque Armstrongand Aldrin expect to place on the moon will become man’s epitaph.”On July 20, while Apollo 11 was approaching the moon, and the world was waitingbreathlessly, Mr. Sevareid found it appropriate to broadcast the followingremark: no matter how great this event, he said, nothing much has changed, “manstill puts his pants on, one leg at a time, he still argues with his wife,” etc.Well, each to his own hierarchy of values and of importance.On the same day, David Brinkley of NBC observed that since men can now see andhear everything directly on television, by sensory-perceptual means (as hestressed), commentators are no longer needed at all. This implies that perceivedevents will somehow provide men automatically with the appropriate conceptualconclusions. The truth is that the more men perceive, the more they need thehelp of commentators, but of commentators who are able to provide a conceptualanalysis.According to a fan letter I received from Canada, the U.S. TV-commentariesduring Apollo 11’s flight were mild compared to those on Canadian television.“We listened to an appalling panel of ‘experts’ disparage the project as a ‘meretechnological cleverness by a stupid, pretentious speck of dust in the cosmos.’... They were also very concerned about the ‘inflated American ego’ if thevoyage succeeded. One almost got the impression that they would be greatlyrelieved if the mission failed!”What is the actual motive behind this attitude—the unadmitted, subconsciousmotive? An intelligent American newsman, Harry Reasoner of CBS, named itinadvertently; I had the impression that he did not realize the importance ofhis own statement. Many voices, at the time, were declaring that the success ofApollo 11 would destroy the poetic-romantic glamor of the moon, its fascinatingmystery, its appeal to lovers and to human imagination. Harry Reasoner summed itup by saying simply, quietly, a little sadly, that if the moon is found to bemade of green cheese, it will be a blow to science; but if it isn’t, it will bea blow to “those of us whose life is not so well organized.”And this is the whole shabby secret: to some men, the sight of an achievement isa reproach, a reminder that their own lives are irrational and that there is noloophole, no escape from reason and reality. Their resentment is the corneredDionysian element baring its teeth.What Harry Reasoner’s statement implied was the fact that only the vanguard ofthe Dionysian cohorts is made up of wild, rampaging irrationalists, openlyproclaiming their hatred of reason, dripping wine and blood. The bulk ofDionysus’ strength, his grass-roots following, consists of sedate little soulswho never commit any major crime against reason, who merely indulge their pettyirrational whims once in a while, covertly—and, overtly, seek a “balance ofpower,” a compromise between whims and reality. But reason is an absolute: inorder to betray it, one does not have to dance naked in the streets with vineleaves in one’s hair; one betrays it merely by sneaking down the back stairs.Then, someday, one finds oneself unable to grasp why one feels no joy at thescientific discoveries that prolong human life or why the naked dancers areprancing all over one’s own body....017 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_017_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: How can one live by reason, students often asked, when mostpeople are unreasonable? Here, in part, from The Virtue of Selfishness is AR’sanswer, written in 1962.HOW DOES ONE LEAD A RATIONAL LIFE IN AN IRRATIONAL SOCIETY?I WILL confine my answer to a single, fundamental aspect of this question. Iwill name only one principle, the opposite of the idea which is so prevalenttoday and which is responsible for the spread of evil in the world. Thatprinciple is: One must never fail to pronounce moral judgment.Nothing can corrupt and disintegrate a culture or a man’s character asthoroughly as does the precept of moral agnosticism, the idea that one mustnever pass moral judgment on others, that one must be morally tolerant ofanything, that the good consists of never distinguishing good from evil.It is obvious who profits and who loses by such a precept. It is not justice orequal treatment that you grant to men when you abstain equally from praisingmen’s virtues and from condemning men’s vices. When your impartial attitudedeclares, in effect, that neither the good nor the evil may expect anything fromyou—whom do you betray and whom do you encourage?But to pronounce moral judgment is an enormous responsibility. To be a judge,one must possess an unimpeachable character; one need not be omniscient orinfallible, and it is not an issue of errors of knowledge; one needs anunbreached integrity, that is, the absence of any indulgence in conscious,willful evil. Just as a judge in a court of law may err, when the evidence isinconclusive, but may not evade the evidence available, nor accept bribes, norallow any personal feeling, emotion, desire or fear to obstruct his mind’sjudgment of the facts of reality—so every rational person must maintain anequally strict and solemn integrity in the courtroom within his own mind, wherethe responsibility is more awesome than in a public tribunal, because he, thejudge, is the only one to know when he has been impeached.There is, however, a court of appeal from one’s judgments: objective reality. Ajudge puts himself on trial every time he pronounces a verdict. It is only intoday’s reign of amoral cynicism, subjectivism and hooliganism that men mayimagine themselves free to utter any sort of irrational judgment and to sufferno consequences. But, in fact, a man is to be judged by the judgments hepronounces. The things which he condemns or extols exist in objective realityand are open to the independent appraisal of others. It is his own moralcharacter and standards that he reveals, when he blames or praises. If hecondemns America and extols Soviet Russia—or if he attacks businessmen anddefends juvenile delinquents—or if he denounces a great work of art and praisestrash—it is the nature of his own soul that he confesses.It is their fear of this responsibility that prompts most people to adopt anattitude of indiscriminate moral neutrality. It is the fear best expressed inthe precept: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.” But that precept, in fact, isan abdication of moral responsibility: it is a moral blank check one gives toothers in exchange for a moral blank check one expects for oneself.There is no escape from the fact that men have to make choices; so long as menhave to make choices, there is no escape from moral values; so long as moralvalues are at stake, no moral neutrality is possible. To abstain from condemninga torturer, is to become an accessory to the torture and murder of his victims.The moral principle to adopt in this issue, is: “Judge, and be prepared to bejudged.”The opposite of moral neutrality is not a blind, arbitrary, self-righteouscondemnation of any idea, action or person that does not fit one’s mood, one’smemorized slogans or one’s snap judgment of the moment. Indiscriminate toleranceand indiscriminate condemnation are not two opposites: they are two variants ofthe same evasion. To declare that “everybody is white” or “everybody is black”or “everybody is neither white nor black, but gray,” is not a moral judgment,but an escape from the responsibility of moral judgment.To judge means: to evaluate a given concrete by reference to an abstractprinciple or standard. It is not an easy task; it is not a task that can beperformed automatically by one’s feelings, “instincts” or hunches. It is a taskthat requires the most precise, the most exacting, the most ruthlessly objectiveand rational process of thought. It is fairly easy to grasp abstract moralprinciples; it can be very difficult to apply them to a given situation,particularly when it involves the moral character of another person. When onepronounces moral judgment, whether in praise or in blame, one must be preparedto answer “Why?” and to prove one’s case—to oneself and to any rationalinquirer.The policy of always pronouncing moral judgment does not mean that one mustregard oneself as a missionary charged with the responsibility of “savingeveryone’s soul”—nor that one must give unsolicited moral appraisals to allthose one meets. It means: (a) that one must know clearly, in full, verballyidentified form, one’s own moral evaluation of every person, issue and eventwith which one deals, and act accordingly; (b) that one must make one’s moralevaluation known to others, when it is rationally appropriate to do so.This last means that one need not launch into unprovoked moral denunciations ordebates, but that one must speak up in situations where silence can objectivelybe taken to mean agreement with or sanction of evil. When one deals withirrational persons, where argument is futile, a mere “I don’t agree with you” issufficient to negate any implication of moral sanction. When one deals withbetter people, a full statement of one’s views may be morally required. But inno case and in no situation may one permit one’s own values to be attacked ordenounced, and keep silent.Moral values are the motive power of a man’s actions. By pronouncing moraljudgment, one protects the clarity of one’s own perception and the rationalityof the course one chooses to pursue. It makes a difference whether one thinksthat one is dealing with human errors of knowledge or with human evil.Observe how many people evade, rationalize and drive their minds into a state ofblind stupor, in dread of discovering that those they deal with—their “lovedones” or friends or business associates or political rulers—are not merelymistaken, but evil. Observe that this dread leads them to sanction, to help andto spread the very evil whose existence they fear to acknowledge.If people did not indulge in such abject evasions as the claim that somecontemptible liar “means well”—that a mooching bum “can’t help it”—that ajuvenile delinquent “needs love”—that a criminal “doesn’t know any better”—thata power-seeking politician is moved by patriotic concern for “the publicgood”—that communists are merely “agrarian reformers”—the history of the pastfew decades, or centuries, would have been different.Ask yourself why totalitarian dictatorships find it necessary to pour money andeffort into propaganda for their own helpless, chained, gagged slaves, who haveno means of protest or defense. The answer is that even the humblest peasant orthe lowest savage would rise in blind rebellion, were he to realize that he isbeing immolated, not to some incomprehensible “noble purpose,” but to plain,naked human evil.Observe also that moral neutrality necessitates a progressive sympathy for viceand a progressive antagonism to virtue. A man who struggles not to acknowledgethat evil is evil, finds it increasingly dangerous to acknowledge that the goodis the good. To him, a person of virtue is a threat that can topple all of hisevasions—particularly when an issue of justice is involved, which demands thathe take sides. It is then that such formulas as “Nobody is ever fully right orfully wrong” and “Who am I to judge?” take their lethal effect. The man whobegins by saying: “There is some good in the worst of us,” goes on to say:“There is some bad in the best of us”—then: “There’s got to be some bad in thebest of us”—and then: “It’s the best of us who make life difficult—why don’tthey keep silent?—who are they to judge?”And then, on some gray, middle-aged morning, such a man realizes suddenly thathe has betrayed all the values he had loved in his distant spring, and wondershow it happened, and slams his mind shut to the answer, by telling himselfhastily that the fear he had felt in his worst, most shameful moments was rightand that values have no chance in this world.An irrational society is a society of moral cowards—of men paralyzed by the lossof moral standards, principles and goals. But since men have to act, so long asthey live, such a society is ready to be taken over by anyone willing to set itsdirection. The initiative can come from only two types of men: either from theman who is willing to assume the responsibility of asserting rational values—orfrom the thug who is not troubled by questions of responsibility.No matter how hard the struggle, there is only one choice that a rational mancan make in the face of such an alternative."},{"pageContent":"PART THREEAtlas ShruggedEDITOR’s NOTE: The theme of Atlas Shrugged is the role of man’s mind—andspecifically of the men of ability—in human existence. “I set out to show,” saidAR, “how desperately the world needs prime movers, and how viciously it treatsthem. And I show it on a hypothetical case—what happens to the world withoutthem” (Journals of Ayn Rand, 1997, p. 392). This is the plot-theme of the novel:what happens when the world’s thinkers and producers go on strike against therule of the mindless.The first excerpt (from Chapter VI) presents the anniversary party of a leadingsteel industrialist, Hank Rearden, who is the greatest victim of the world’smistreatment. Rearden has just created—after ten years of excruciating effort—aninvaluable new type of metal. Out of the first heat, he had ordered a specialbracelet for his wife, Lillian.Dagny Taggart, the novel’s heroine, is the operating vice president of TaggartTranscontinental Railroad; her brother James is its president. Dagny has beenworking closely with Rearden to build a new railroad with track made of ReardenMetal. Francisco d’Anconia, a copper baron, is—by all appearances at thispoint—a worthless playboy who is wasting his great potential along with a hugeinherited fortune."},{"pageContent":"Rearden’s Anniversary PartyREARDEN PRESSED his forehead to the mirror and tried not to think.That was the only way he could go through with it, he told himself. Heconcentrated on the relief of the mirror’s cooling touch, wondering how one wentabout forcing one’s mind into blankness, particularly after a lifetime lived onthe axiom that the constant, clearest, most ruthless function of his rationalfaculty was his foremost duty. He wondered why no effort had ever seemed beyondhis capacity, yet now he could not scrape up the strength to stick a few blackpearl studs into his starched white shirt front.This was his wedding anniversary and he had known for three months that theparty would take place tonight, as Lillian wished. He had promised it to her,safe in the knowledge that the party was a long way off and that he would attendto it, when the time came, as he attended to every duty on his overloadedschedule. Then, during three months of eighteen-hour workdays, he had forgottenit happily—until half an hour ago, when, long past dinner time, his secretaryhad entered his office and said firmly, “Your party, Mr. Rearden.” He had cried,“Good God!” leaping to his feet; he had hurried home, rushed up the stairs,started tearing his clothes off and gone through the routine of dressing,conscious only of the need to hurry, not of the purpose. When the fullrealization of the purpose struck him like a sudden blow, he stopped.“You don’t care for anything but business.” He had heard it all his life,pronounced as a verdict of damnation. He had always known that business wasregarded as some sort of secret, shameful cult, which one did not impose oninnocent laymen, that people thought of it as of an ugly necessity, to beperformed but never mentioned, that to talk shop was an offense against highersensibilities, that just as one washed machine grease off one’s hands beforecoming home, so one was supposed to wash the stain of business off one’s mindbefore entering a drawing room. He had never held that creed, but he hadaccepted it as natural that his family should hold it. He took it forgranted—wordlessly, in the manner of a feeling absorbed in childhood, leftunquestioned and unnamed—that he had dedicated himself, like the martyr of somedark religion, to the service of a faith which was his passionate love, butwhich made him an outcast among men, whose sympathy he was not to expect.He had accepted the tenet that it was his duty to give his wife some form ofexistence unrelated to business. But he had never found the capacity to do it oreven to experience a sense of guilt. He could neither force himself to changenor blame her if she chose to condemn him.He had given Lillian none of his time for months—no, he thought, for years; forthe eight years of their marriage. He had no interest to spare for herinterests, not even enough to learn just what they were. She had a large circleof friends, and he had heard it said that their names represented the heart ofthe country’s culture, but he had never had time to meet them or even toacknowledge their fame by knowing what achievements had earned it. He knew onlythat he often saw their names on the magazine covers on newsstands. If Lillianresented his attitude, he thought, she was right. If her manner toward him wasobjectionable, he deserved it. If his family called him heartless, it was true.He had never spared himself in any issue. When a problem came up at the mills,his first concern was to discover what error he had made; he did not search foranyone’s fault but his own; it was of himself that he demanded perfection. Hewould grant himself no mercy now; he took the blame. But at the mills, itprompted him to action in an immediate impulse to correct the error; now, it hadno effect.... Just a few more minutes, he thought, standing against the mirror,his eyes closed.He could not stop the thing in his mind that went on throwing words at him; itwas like trying to plug a broken hydrant with his bare hands. Stinging jets,part words, part pictures, kept shooting at his brain.... Hours of it, hethought, hours to spend watching the eyes of the guests getting heavy withboredom if they were sober or glazing into an imbecile stare if they weren‘t,and pretend that he noticed neither, and strain to think of something to say tothem, when he had nothing to say—while he needed hours of inquiry to find asuccessor for the superintendent of his rolling mills who had resigned suddenly,without explanation—he had to do it at once—men of that sort were so hard tofind—and if anything happened to break the flow of the rolling mills—it was theTaggart rail that was being rolled.... He remembered the silent reproach, thelook of accusation, long-bearing patience and scorn, which he always saw in theeyes of his family when they caught some evidence of his passion for hisbusiness—and the futility of his silence, of his hope that they would not thinkRearden Steel meant as much to him as it did—like a drunkard pretendingindifference to liquor, among people who watch him with the scornful amusementof their full knowledge of his shameful weakness.... “I heard you last nightcoming home at two in the morning, where were you?” his mother saying to him atthe dinner table, and Lillian answering, “Why, at the mills, of course,” asanother wife would say, “At the corner saloon.” ... Or Lillian asking him, thehint of a wise half-smile on her face, “What were you doing in New Yorkyesterday?” “It was a banquet with the boys.” “Business?” “Yes.” “Of course”—andLillian turning away, nothing more, except the shameful realization that he hadalmost hoped she would think he had attended some sort of obscene stag party....An ore carrier had gone down in a storm on Lake Michigan, with thousands of tonsof Rearden ore—those boats were falling apart—if he didn’t take it upon himselfto help them obtain the replacements they needed, the owners of the line wouldgo bankrupt, and there was no other line left in operation on Lake Michigan....“That nook?” said Lillian, pointing to an arrangement of settees and coffeetables in their drawing room. “Why, no, Henry, it’s not new, but I suppose Ishould feel flattered that three weeks is all it took you to notice it. It’s myown adaptation of the morning room of a famous French palace—but things likethat can’t possibly interest you, darling, there’s no stock market quotation onthem, none whatever.” ... The order for copper, which he had placed six monthsago, had not been delivered, the promised date had been postponed threetimes—“We can’t help it, Mr. Rearden”—he had to find another company to dealwith, the supply of copper was becoming increasingly uncertain.... Philip[Rearden’s brother] did not smile, when he looked up in the midst of a speech hewas making to some friend of their mother’s, about some organization he hadjoined, but there was something that suggested a smile of superiority in theloose muscles of his face when he said, “No, you wouldn’t care for this, it’snot business, Henry, not business at all, it’s a strictly non-commercialendeavor.” ... That contractor in Detroit, with the job of rebuilding a largefactory, was considering structural shapes of Rearden Metal—he should fly toDetroit and speak to him in person—he should have done it a week ago—he couldhave done it tonight.... “You’re not listening,” said his mother at thebreakfast table, when his mind wandered to the current coal price index, whileshe was telling him about the dream she’d had last night. “You’ve never listenedto a living soul. You’re not interested in anything but yourself. You don’t givea damn about people, not about a single human creature on God’s earth.” ... Thetyped pages lying on the desk in his office were a report on the tests of anairplane motor made of Rearden Metal—perhaps of all things on earth, the one hewanted most at this moment was to read it—it had lain on his desk, untouched,for three days, he had had no time for it—why didn’t he do it now and—He shook his head violently, opening his eyes, stepping back from the mirror.He tried to reach for the shirt studs. He saw his hand reaching, instead, forthe pile of mail on his dresser. It was mail picked as urgent, it had to be readtonight, but he had had no time to read it in the office. His secretary hadstuffed it into his pocket on his way out. He had thrown it there whileundressing.A newspaper clipping fluttered down to the floor. It was an editorial which hissecretary had marked with an angry slash in red pencil. It was entitled“Equalization of Opportunity.” He had to read it: there had been too much talkabout this issue in the last three months, ominously too much.He read it, with the sound of voices and forced laughter coming from downstairs,reminding him that the guests were arriving, that the party had started and thathe would face the bitter, reproachful glances of his family when he came down.The editorial said that at a time of dwindling production, shrinking markets andvanishing opportunities to make a living, it was unfair to let one man hoardseveral business enterprises, while others had none; it was destructive to let afew corner all the resources, leaving others no chance; competition wasessential to society, and it was society’s duty to see that no competitor everrose beyond the range of anybody who wanted to compete with him. The editorialpredicted the passage of a bill which had been proposed, a bill forbidding anyperson or corporation to own more than one business concern.Wesley Mouch, his Washington man, had told Rearden not to worry; the fight wouldbe stiff, he had said, but the bill would be defeated. Rearden understoodnothing about that kind of fight. He left it to Mouch and his staff. He couldbarely find time to skim through their reports from Washington and to sign thechecks which Mouch requested for the battle.Rearden did not believe that the bill would pass. He was incapable of believingit. Having dealt with the clean reality of metals, technology, production allhis life, he had acquired the conviction that one had to concern oneself withthe rational, not the insane—that one had to seek that which was right, becausethe right answer always won—that the senseless, the wrong, the monstrouslyunjust could not work, could not succeed, could do nothing but defeat itself. Abattle against a thing such as that bill seemed preposterous and faintlyembarrassing to him, as if he were suddenly asked to compete with a man whocalculated steel mixtures by the formulas of numerology.He had told himself that the issue was dangerous. But the loudest screaming ofthe most hysterical editorial roused no emotion in him—while a variation of adecimal point in a laboratory report on a test of Rearden Metal made him leap tohis feet in eagerness or apprehension. He had no energy to spare for anythingelse.He crumpled the editorial and threw it into the wastebasket. He felt the leadenapproach of that exhaustion which he never felt at his job, the exhaustion thatseemed to wait for him and catch him the moment he turned to other concerns. Hefelt as if he were incapable of any desire except a desperate longing for sleep.He told himself that he had to attend the party—that his family had the right todemand it of him—that he had to learn to like their kind of pleasure, for theirsake, not his own.He wondered why this was a motive that had no power to impel him. Throughout hislife, whenever he became convinced that a course of action was right, the desireto follow it had come automatically. What was happening to him?—he wondered. Theimpossible conflict of feeling reluctance to do that which was right—wasn’t itthe basic formula of moral corruption? To recognize one’s guilt, yet feelnothing but the coldest, most profound indifference—wasn’t it a betrayal of thatwhich had been the motor of his life-course and of his pride?He gave himself no time to seek an answer. He finished dressing, quickly,pitilessly.Holding himself erect, his tall figure moving with the unstressed, unhurriedconfidence of habitual authority, the white of a fine handkerchief in the breastpocket of his black dinner jacket, he walked slowly down the stairs to thedrawing room, looking—to the satisfaction of the dowagers who watched him—likethe perfect figure of a great industrialist.He saw Lillian at the foot of the stairs. The patrician lines of a lemon-yellowEmpire evening gown stressed her graceful body, and she stood like a personproudly in control of her proper background. He smiled; he liked to see herhappy; it gave some reasonable justification to the party.He approached her—and stopped. She had always shown good taste in her use ofjewelry, never wearing too much of it. But tonight she wore an ostentatiousdisplay: a diamond necklace, earrings, rings and brooches. Her arms lookedconspicuously bare by contrast. On her right wrist, as sole ornament, she worethe bracelet of Rearden Metal. The glittering gems made it look like an uglypiece of dime-store jewelry.When he moved his glance from her wrist to her face, he found her looking athim. Her eyes were narrowed and he could not define their expression; it was alook that seemed both veiled and purposeful, the look of something hidden thatflaunted its security from detection.He wanted to tear the bracelet off her wrist. Instead, in obedience to her voicegaily pronouncing an introduction, he bowed to the dowager who stood beside her,his face expressionless.“Man? What is man? He’s just a collection of chemicals with delusions ofgrandeur,” said Dr. Pritchett to a group of guests across the room.Dr. Pritchett picked a canape off a crystal dish, held it speared between twostraight fingers and deposited it whole into his mouth.“Man’s metaphysical pretensions,” he said, “are preposterous. A miserable bit ofprotoplasm, full of ugly little concepts and mean little emotions—and itimagines itself important! Really, you know, that is the root of all thetroubles in the world.”“But which concepts are not ugly or mean, Professor?” asked an earnest matronwhose husband owned an automobile factory.“None,” said Dr. Pritchett. “None within the range of man’s capacity:”A young man asked hesitantly, “But if we haven’t any good concepts, how do weknow that the ones we’ve got are ugly? I mean, by what standard?”“There aren’t any standards.”This silenced his audience.“The philosophers of the past were superficial,” Dr. Pritchett went on. “Itremained for our century to redefine the purpose of philosophy. The purpose ofphilosophy is not to help men find the meaning of life, but to prove to themthat there isn’t any.”An attractive young woman, whose father owned a coal mine, asked indignantly,“Who can tell us that?”“I am trying to,” said Dr. Pritchett. For the last three years, he had been headof the Department of Philosophy at the Patrick Henry University.Lillian Rearden approached, her jewels glittering under the lights. Theexpression on her face was held to the soft hint of a smile, set and faintlysuggested, like the waves of her hair.“It is this insistence of man upon meaning that makes him so difficult,” saidDr. Pritchett. “Once he realizes that he is of no importance whatever in thevast scheme of the universe, that no possible significance can be attached tohis activities, that it does not matter whether he lives or dies, he will becomemuch more... tractable.”He shrugged and reached for another canape. A businessman said uneasily, “What Iasked you about, Professor, was what you thought about the Equalization ofOpportunity Bill.”“Oh, that?” said Dr. Pritchett. “But I believe I made it clear that I am infavor of it, because I am in favor of a free economy. A free economy cannotexist without competition. Therefore, men must be forced to compete. Therefore,we must control men in order to force them to be free.”“But, look... isn’t that sort of a contradiction?”“Not in the higher philosophical sense. You must learn to see beyond the staticdefinitions of old-fashioned thinking. Nothing is static in the universe.Everything is fluid.”“But it stands to reason that if—”“Reason, my dear fellow, is the most naive of all superstitions. That, at least,has been generally conceded in our age.”“But I don’t quite understand how we can—”“You suffer from the popular delusion of believing that things can beunderstood. You do not grasp the fact that the universe is a solidcontradiction.”“A contradiction of what?” asked the matron.“Of itself.”“How ... how’s that?”“My dear madam, the duty of thinkers is not to explain, but to demonstrate thatnothing can be explained.”“Yes, of course... only ...”“The purpose of philosophy is not to seek knowledge, but to prove that knowledgeis impossible to man.”“But when we prove it,” asked the young woman, “what’s going to be left?”“Instinct,” said Dr. Pritchett reverently.At the other end of the room, a group was listening to Balph Eubank. He satupright on the edge of an armchair, in order to counteract the appearance of hisface and figure, which had a tendency to spread if relaxed.“The literature of the past,” said Balph Eubank, “was a shallow fraud. Itwhitewashed life in order to please the money tycoons whom it served. Morality,free will, achievement, happy endings, and man as some sort of heroic being—allthat stuff is laughable to us. Our age has given depth to literature for thefirst time, by exposing the real essence of life.”A very young girl in a white evening gown asked timidly, “What is the realessence of life, Mr. Eubank?”“Suffering,” said Balph Eubank. “Defeat and suffering.”“But ... but why? People are happy... sometimes ... aren’t they?”“That is a delusion of those whose emotions are superficial.”The girl blushed. A wealthy woman who had inherited an oil refinery, askedguiltily, “What should we do to raise the people’s literary taste, Mr. Eubank?”“That is a great social problem,” said Balph Eubank. He was described as theliterary leader of the age, but had never written a book that sold more thanthree thousand copies. “Personally, I believe that an Equalization ofOpportunity Bill applying to literature would be the solution.”“Oh, do you approve of that Bill for industry? I’m not sure I know what to thinkof it.”“Certainly, I approve of it. Our culture has sunk into a bog of materialism. Menhave lost all spiritual values in their pursuit of material production andtechnological trickery. They’re too comfortable. They will return to a noblerlife if we teach them to bear privations. So we ought to place a limit upontheir material greed.”“I hadn’t thought of it that way,” said the woman apologetically.“But how are you going to work an Equalization of Opportunity Bill forliterature, Ralph?” asked Mort Liddy. “That’s a new one on me.”“My name is Balph,” said Eubank angrily. “And it’s a new one on you because it’smy own idea.”“Okay, okay, I’m not quarreling, am I? I’m just asking.” Mort Liddy smiled. Hespent most of his time smiling nervously. He was a composer who wroteold-fashioned scores for motion pictures, and modern symphonies for sparseaudiences.“It would work very simply,” said Balph Eubank. “There should be a law limitingthe sale of any book to ten thousand copies. This would throw the literarymarket open to new talent, fresh ideas and non-commercial writing. If peoplewere forbidden to buy a million copies of the same piece of trash, they would beforced to buy better books.”“You’ve got something there,” said Mort Liddy. “But wouldn’t it be kinda toughon the writers’ bank accounts?”“So much the better. Only those whose motive is not moneymaking should beallowed to write.”“But, Mr. Eubank,” asked the young girl in the white dress, “what if more thanten thousand people want to buy a certain book?”“Ten thousand readers is enough for any book.”“That’s not what I mean. I mean, what if they want it?”“That is irrelevant.”“But if a book has a good story which—”“Plot is a primitive vulgarity in literature,” said Balph Eubank contemptuously.Dr. Pritchett, on his way across the room to the bar, stopped to say, “Quite so.Just as logic is a primitive vulgarity in philosophy.”“Just as melody is a primitive vulgarity in music,” said Mort Liddy.“What’s all this noise?” asked Lillian Rearden, glittering to a stop besidethem.“Lillian, my angel,” Balph Eubank drawled, “did I tell you that I’m dedicatingmy new novel to you?”“Why, thank you, darling.”“What is the name of your new novel?” asked the wealthy woman.“The Heart Is a Milkman.”“What is it about?”“Frustration.”“But, Mr. Eubank,” asked the young girl in the white dress, blushingdesperately, “if everything is frustration, what is there to live for?”“Brother-love,” said Balph Eubank grimly.Bertram Scudder stood slouched against the bar. His long, thin face looked as ifit had shrunk inward, with the exception of his mouth and eyeballs, which wereleft to protrude as three soft globes. He was the editor of a magazine calledThe Future and he had written an article on Hank Rearden, entitled “TheOctopus.”Bertram Scudder picked up his empty glass and shoved it silently toward thebartender, to be refilled. He took a gulp from his fresh drink, noticed theempty glass in front of Philip Rearden, who stood beside him, and jerked histhumb in a silent command to the bartender. He ignored the empty glass in frontof Betty Pope, who stood at Philip’s other side.“Look, bud,” said Bertram Scudder, his eyeballs focused approximately in thedirection of Philip, “whether you like it or not, the Equalization ofOpportunity Bill represents a great step forward.”“What made you think that I did not like it, Mr. Scudder?” Philip asked humbly.“Well, it’s going to pinch, isn’t it? The long arm of society is going to trim alittle off the hors d’oeuvres bill around here.” He waved his hand at the bar.“Why do you assume that I object to that?”“You don’t?” Bertram Scudder asked without curiosity.“I don’t!” said Philip hotly. “I have always placed the public good above anypersonal consideration. I have contributed my time and money to Friends ofGlobal Progress in their crusade for the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Ithink it is perfectly unfair that one man should get all the breaks and leavenone to others.”Bertram Scudder considered him speculatively, but without particular interest.“Well, that’s quite unusually nice of you,” he said.“Some people do take moral issues seriously, Mr. Scudder,” said Philip, with agentle stress of pride in his voice.“What’s he talking about, Philip?” asked Betty Pope. “We don’t know anybody whoowns more than one business, do we?”“Oh, pipe down!” said Bertram Scudder, his voice bored.“I don’t see why there’s so much fuss about that Equalization of OpportunityBill,” said Betty Pope aggressively, in the tone of an expert on economics. “Idon’t see why businessmen object to it. It’s to their own advantage. Ifeverybody else is poor, they won’t have any market for their goods. But if theystop being selfish and share the goods they’ve hoarded—they’ll have a chance towork hard and produce some more.”“I do not see why industrialists should be considered at all,” said Scudder.“When the masses are destitute and yet there are goods available, it’s idioticto expect people to be stopped by some scrap of paper called a property deed.Property rights are a superstition. One holds property only by the courtesy ofthose who do not seize it. The people can seize it at any moment. If they can,why shouldn’t they?”“They should,” said Claude Slagenhop. “They need it. Need is the onlyconsideration. If people are in need, we’ve got to seize things first and talkabout it afterwards.”Claude Slagenhop had approached and managed to squeeze himself between Philipand Scudder, shoving Scudder aside imperceptibly. Slagenhop was not tall orheavy, but he had a square, compact bulk, and a broken nose. He was thepresident of Friends of Global Progress.“Hunger won’t wait,” said Claude Slagenhop. “Ideas are just hot air. An emptybelly is a solid fact. I’ve said in all my speeches that it’s not necessary totalk too much. Society is suffering for lack of business opportunities at themoment, so we’ve got the right to seize such opportunities as exist. Right iswhatever’s good for society.”“He didn’t dig that ore single-handed, did he?” cried Philip suddenly, his voiceshrill. “He had to employ hundreds of workers. They did it. Why does he thinkhe’s so good?”The two men looked at him, Scudder lifting an eyebrow, Slagenhop withoutexpression.“Oh, dear me!” said Betty Pope, remembering.Hank Rearden stood at a window in a dim recess at the end of the drawing room.He hoped no one would notice him for a few minutes. He had just escaped from amiddle-aged woman who had been telling him about her psychic experiences. Hestood, looking out. Far in the distance, the red glow of Rearden Steel moved inthe sky. He watched it for a moment’s relief.He turned to look at the drawing room. He had never liked his house; it had beenLillian’s choice. But tonight, the shifting colors of the evening dressesdrowned out the appearance of the room and gave it an air of brilliant gaiety.He liked to see people being gay, even though he did not understand thisparticular manner of enjoyment.He looked at the flowers, at the sparks of light on the crystal glasses, at thenaked arms and shoulders of women. There was a cold wind outside, sweeping emptystretches of land. He saw the thin branches of a tree being twisted, like armswaving in an appeal for help. The tree stood against the glow of the mills.He could not name his sudden emotion. He had no words to state its cause, itsquality, its meaning. Some part of it was joy, but it was solemn like the act ofbaring one’s head—he did not know to whom.When he stepped back into the crowd, he was smiling. But the smile vanishedabruptly; he saw the entrance of a new guest: it was Dagny Taggart.Lillian moved forward to meet her, studying her with curiosity. They had metbefore, on infrequent occasions, and she found it strange to see Dagny Taggartwearing an evening gown. It was a black dress with a bodice that fell as a capeover one arm and shoulder, leaving the other bare; the naked shoulder was thegown’s only ornament. Seeing her in the suits she wore, one never thought ofDagny Taggart’s body. The black dress seemed excessively revealing—because itwas astonishing to discover that the lines of her shoulder were fragile andbeautiful, and that the diamond band on the wrist of her naked arm gave her themost feminine of all aspects: the look of being chained.“Miss Taggart, it is such a wonderful surprise to see you here,” said LillianRearden, the muscles of her face performing the motions of a smile. “I had notreally dared to hope that an invitation from me would take you away from yourever so much weightier concerns. Do permit me to feel flattered.”James Taggart had entered with his sister. Lillian smiled at him, in the mannerof a hasty postscript, as if noticing him for the first time.“Hello, James. That’s your penalty for being popular—one tends to lose sight ofyou in the surprise of seeing your sister.”“No one can match you in popularity, Lillian,” he answered, smiling thinly, “norever lose sight of you.”“Me? Oh, but I am quite resigned to taking second place in the shadow of myhusband. I am humbly aware that the wife of a great man has to be contented withreflected glory—don’t you think so, Miss Taggart?”“No,” said Dagny, “I don’t.”“Is this a compliment or a reproach, Miss Taggart? But do forgive me if Iconfess I’m helpless. Whom may I present to you? I’m afraid I have nothing butwriters and artists to offer, and they wouldn’t interest you, I’m sure.”“I’d like to find Hank and say hello to him.”“But of course. James, do you remember you said you wanted to meet BalphEubank?—oh yes, he’s here—I’ll tell him that I heard you rave about his lastnovel at Mrs. Whitcomb’s dinner!”Walking across the room, Dagny wondered why she had said that she wanted to findHank Rearden, what had prevented her from admitting that she had seen him themoment she entered.Rearden stood at the other end of the long room, looking at her. He watched heras she approached, but he did not step forward to meet her.“Hello, Hank.”“Good evening.”He bowed, courteously, impersonally, the movement of his body matching thedistinguished formality of his clothes. He did not smile.“Thank you for inviting me tonight,” she said gaily.“I cannot claim that I knew you were coming.”“Oh? Then I’m glad that Mrs. Rearden thought of me. I wanted to make anexception.”“An exception?”“I don’t go to parties very often.”“I am pleased that you chose this occasion as the exception.” He did not add“Miss Taggart,” but it sounded as if he had.The formality of his manner was so unexpected that she was unable to adjust toit. “I wanted to celebrate,” she said.“To celebrate my wedding anniversary?”“Oh, is it your wedding anniversary? I didn’t know. My congratulations, Hank.”“What did you wish to celebrate?”“I thought I’d permit myself a rest. A celebration of my own—in your honor andmine.”“For what reason?”She was thinking of the new track on the rocky grades of the Colorado mountains,growing slowly toward the distant goal of the Wyatt oil fields. She was seeingthe greenish-blue glow of the rails on the frozen ground, among the dried weeds,the naked boulders, the rotting shanties of half-starved settlements.“In honor of the first sixty miles of Rearden Metal track,” she answered.“I appreciate it.” The tone of his voice was the one that would have been properif he had said, “I’ve never heard of it.”She found nothing else to say. She felt as if she were speaking to a stranger.“Why, Miss Taggart!” a cheerful voice broke their silence. “Now this is what Imean when I say that Hank Rearden can achieve any miracle!”A businessman whom they knew had approached, smiling at her in delightedastonishment. The three of them had often held emergency conferences aboutfreight rates and steel deliveries. Now he looked at her, his face an opencomment on the change in her appearance, the change, she thought, which Reardenhad not noticed.She laughed, answering the man’s greeting, giving herself no time to recognizethe unexpected stab of disappointment, the unadmitted thought that she wishedshe had seen this look on Rearden’s face, instead. She exchanged a few sentenceswith the man. When she glanced around, Rearden was gone.“So that is your famous sister?” said Balph Eubank to James Taggart, looking atDagny across the room.“I was not aware that my sister was famous,” said Taggart, a faint bite in hisvoice.“But, my good man, she’s an unusual phenomenon in the field of economics, so youmust expect people to talk about her. Your sister is a symptom of the illness ofour century. A decadent product of the machine age. Machines have destroyedman’s humanity, taken him away from the soil, robbed him of his natural arts,killed his soul and turned him into an insensitive robot. There’s an example ofit—a woman who runs a railroad, instead of practicing the beautiful craft of thehandloom and bearing children.”Rearden moved among the guests, trying not to be trapped into conversation. Helooked at the room; he saw no one he wished to approach.“Say, Hank Rearden, you’re not such a bad fellow at all when seen close up inthe lion’s own den. You ought to give us a press conference once in a while,you’d win us over.”Rearden turned and looked at the speaker incredulously. It was a youngnewspaperman of the seedier sort, who worked on a radical tabloid. The offensivefamiliarity of his manner seemed to imply that he chose to be rude to Reardenbecause he knew that Rearden should never have permitted himself to associatewith a man of his kind.Rearden would not have allowed him inside the mills; but the man was Lillian’sguest; he controlled himself; he asked dryly, “What do you want?”“You’re not so bad. You’ve got talent. Technological talent. But, of course, Idon’t agree with you about Rearden Metal.”“I haven’t asked you to agree.”“Well, Bertram Scudder said that your policy—” the man started belligerently,pointing toward the bar, but stopped, as if he had slid farther than heintended.Rearden looked at the untidy figure slouched against the bar. Lillian hadintroduced them, but he had paid no attention to the name. He turned sharply andwalked off, in a manner that forbade the young bum to tag him.Lillian glanced up at his face, when Rearden approached her in the midst of agroup, and, without a word, stepped aside where they could not be heard.“Is that Scudder of The Future?” he asked, pointing.“Why, yes.”He looked at her silently, unable to begin to believe it, unable to find thelead of a thought with which to begin to understand. Her eyes were watching him.“How could you invite him here?” he asked.“Now, Henry, don’t let’s be ridiculous. You don’t want to be narrow-minded, doyou? You must learn to tolerate the opinions of others and respect their rightof free speech.”“In my house?”“Oh, don’t be stuffy!”He did not speak, because his consciousness was held, not by coherentstatements, but by two pictures that seemed to glare at him insistently. He sawthe article, “The Octopus,” by Bertram Scudder, which was not an expression ofideas, but a bucket of slime emptied in public—an article that did not contain asingle fact, not even an invented one, but poured a stream of sneers andadjectives in which nothing was clear except the filthy malice of denouncingwithout considering proof necessary, And he saw the lines of Lillian’s profile,the proud purity which he had sought in marrying her.When he noticed her again, he realized that the vision of her profile was in hisown mind, because she was turned to him fullface, watching him. In the suddeninstant of returning to reality, he thought that what he saw in her eyes wasenjoyment. But in the next instant he reminded himself that he was sane and thatthis was not possible.“It’s the first time you’ve invited that ...” he used an obscene word withunemotional precision, “to my house. It’s the last.”“How dare you use such—”“Don’t argue, Lillian. If you do, I’ll throw him out right now.”He gave her a moment to answer, to object, to scream at him if she wished. Sheremained silent, not looking at him, only her smooth cheeks seemed faintly drawninward, as if deflated.Moving blindly away through the coils of lights, voices and perfume, he felt acold touch of dread. He knew that he should think of Lillian and find the answerto the riddle of her character, because this was a revelation which he could notignore; but he did not think of her—and he felt the dread because he knew thatthe answer had ceased to matter to him long ago.The flood of weariness was starting to rise again. He felt as if he could almostsee it in thickening waves; it was not within him, but outside, spreadingthrough the room. For an instant, he felt as if he were alone, lost in a graydesert, needing help and knowing that no help would come.He stopped short. In the lighted doorway, the length of the room between them,he saw the tall, arrogant figure of a man who had paused for a moment beforeentering. He had never met the man, but of all the notorious faces thatcluttered the pages of newspapers, this was the one he despised. It wasFrancisco d’Anconia.Rearden had never given much thought to men like Bertram Scudder. But with everyhour of his life, with the strain and the pride of every moment when his musclesor his mind had ached from effort, with every step he had taken to rise out ofthe mines of Minnesota and to turn his effort into gold, with all of hisprofound respect for money and for its meaning, he despised the squanderer whodid not know how to deserve the great gift of inherited wealth. There, hethought, was the most contemptible representative of the species.He saw Francisco d’Anconia enter, bow to Lillian, then walk into the crowd as ifhe owned the room which he had never entered before. Heads turned to watch him,as if he pulled them on strings in his wake.Approaching Lillian once more, Rearden said without anger, the contempt becomingamusement in his voice, “I didn’t know you knew that one.”“I’ve met him at a few parties.”“Is he one of your friends, too?”“Certainly not!” The sharp resentment was genuine.“Then why did you invite him?”“Well, you can’t give a party—not a party that counts—while he’s in thiscountry, without inviting him. It’s a nuisance if he comes, and a social blackmark if he doesn’t.”Rearden laughed. She was off guard; she did not usually admit things of thiskind. “Look,” he said wearily, “I don’t want to spoil your party. But keep thatman away from me. Don’t come around with introductions. I don’t want to meethim. I don’t know how you’ll work that, but you’re an expert hostess, so workit.”Dagny stood still when she saw Francisco approaching. He bowed to her as hepassed by. He did not stop, but she knew that he had stopped the moment in hismind. She saw him smile faintly in deliberate emphasis of what he understood anddid not choose to acknowledge. She turned away. She hoped to avoid him for therest of the evening.Balph Eubank had joined the group around Dr. Pritchett, and was saying sullenly,“... no, you cannot expect people to understand the higher reaches ofphilosophy. Culture should be taken out of the hands of the dollar-chasers. Weneed a national subsidy for literature. It is disgraceful that artists aretreated like peddlers and that art works have to be sold like soap.”“You mean, your complaint is that they don’t sell like soap?” asked Franciscod’Anconia.They had not noticed him approach; the conversation stopped, as if slashed off;most of them had never met him, but they all recognized him at once.“I meant—” Balph Eubank started angrily and closed his mouth; he saw the eagerinterest on the faces of his audience, but it was not interest in philosophy anylonger.“Why, hello, Professor!” said Francisco, bowing to Dr. Pritchett.There was no pleasure in Dr. Pritchett’s face when he answered the greeting andperformed a few introductions.“We were just discussing a most interesting subject,” said the earnest matron.“Dr. Pritchett was telling us that nothing is anything.”“He should, undoubtedly, know more than anyone else about that,” Franciscoanswered gravely.“I wouldn’t have supposed that you knew Dr. Pritchett so well, Senor d’Anconia,”she said, and wondered why the professor looked displeased by her remark.“I am an alumnus of the great school that employs Dr. Pritchett at present, thePatrick Henry University. But I studied under one of his predecessors—HughAkston.”“Hugh Akston!” the attractive young woman gasped. “But you couldn’t have, Senord’Anconia! You’re not old enough. I thought he was one of those great namesof... of the last century.”“Perhaps in spirit, madame. Not in fact.”“But I thought he died years ago.”“Why, no. He’s still alive.”“Then why don’t we ever hear about him any more?”“He retired, nine years ago.”“Isn’t it odd? When a politician or a movie star retires, we read front pagestories about it. But when a philosopher retires, people do not even notice it.”“They do, eventually.”A young man said, astonished, “I thought Hugh Akston was one of those classicsthat nobody studied any more, except in histories of philosophy. I read anarticle recently which referred to him as the last of the great advocates ofreason.”“Just what did Hugh Akston teach?” asked the earnest matron.Francisco answered, “He taught that everything is something.”“Your loyalty to your teacher is laudable, Señor d’Anconia,” said Dr. Pritchettdryly. “May we take it that you are an example of the practical results of histeaching?”“I am.”James Taggart had approached the group and was waiting to be noticed.“Hello, Francisco.”“Good evening, James.”“What a wonderful coincidence, seeing you here! I’ve been very anxious to speakto you.”“That’s new. You haven’t always been.”“Now you’re joking, just like in the old days.” Taggart was moving slowly, as ifcasually, away from the group, hoping to draw Francisco after him. “You knowthat there’s not a person in this room who wouldn’t love to talk to you.”“Really? I’d be inclined to suspect the opposite.” Francisco had followedobediently, but stopped within hearing distance of the others.“I have tried in every possible way to get in touch with you,” said Taggart,“but ... but circumstances didn’t permit me to succeed.”“Are you trying to hide from me the fact that I refused to see you?”“Well... that is ... I mean, why did you refuse?”“I couldn’t imagine what you wanted to speak to me about.”“The San Sebastián Mines, of course!” Taggart’s voice rose a little.“Why, what about them?”“But ... Now, look, Francisco, this is serious. It’s a disaster, anunprecedented disaster—and nobody can make any sense out of it. I don’t knowwhat to think. I don’t understand it at all. I have a right to know.”“A right? Aren’t you being old-fashioned, James? But what is it you want toknow?”“Well, first of all, that nationalization [by Mexico]—what are you going to doabout it?”“Nothing.”“Nothing?!”“But surely you don’t want me to do anything about it. My mines and yourrailroad were seized by the will of the people. You wouldn’t want me to opposethe will of the people, would you?”“Francisco, this is not a laughing matter!”“I never thought it was.”“I’m entitled to an explanation! You owe your stockholders an account of thewhole disgraceful affair! Why did you pick a worthless mine? Why did you wasteall those millions? What sort of rotten swindle was it?”Francisco stood looking at him in polite astonishment. “Why, James,” he said, “Ithought you would approve of it.”“Approve?!”“I thought you would consider the San Sebastián Mines as the practicalrealization of an ideal of the highest moral order. Remembering that you and Ihave disagreed so often in the past, I thought you would be gratified to see meacting in accordance with your principles.”“What are you talking about?”Francisco shook his head regretfully. “I don’t know why you should call mybehavior rotten. I thought you would recognize it as an honest effort topractice what the whole world is preaching. Doesn’t everyone believe that it isevil to be selfish? I was totally selfless in regard to the San Sebastiánproject. Isn’t it evil to pursue a personal interest? I had no personal interestin it whatever. Isn’t it evil to work for profit? I did not work for profit—Itook a loss. Doesn’t everyone agree that the purpose and justification of anindustrial enterprise are not production, but the livelihood of its employees?The San Sebastián Mines were the most eminently successful venture in industrialhistory: they produced no copper, but they provided a livelihood for thousandsof men who could not have achieved in a lifetime, the equivalent of what theygot for one day’s work, which they could not do. Isn’t it generally agreed thatan owner is a parasite and an exploiter, that it is the employees who do all thework and make the product possible? I did not exploit anyone. I did not burdenthe San Sebastián Mines with my useless presence; I left them in the hands ofthe men who count. I did not pass judgment on the value of that property. Iturned it over to a mining specialist. He was not a very good specialist, but heneeded the job very badly. Isn’t it generally conceded that when you hire a manfor a job, it is his need that counts, not his ability? Doesn’t everyone believethat in order to get the goods, all you have to do is need them? I haven’tcarried out every moral precept of our age. I expected gratitude and a citationof honor. I do not understand why I am being damned.”In the silence of those who had listened, the sole comment was the shrill,sudden giggle of Betty Pope: she had understood nothing, but she saw the look ofhelpless fury on James Taggart’s face.People were looking at Taggart, expecting an answer. They were indifferent tothe issue, they were merely amused by the spectacle of someone’s embarrassment.Taggart achieved a patronizing smile.“You don’t expect me to take this seriously?” he asked.“There was a time,” Francisco answered, “when I did not believe that anyonecould take it seriously. I was wrong.”“This is outrageous!” Taggart’s voice started to rise. “It’s perfectlyoutrageous to treat your public responsibilities with such thoughtless levity!”He turned to hurry away.Francisco shrugged, spreading his hands. “You see? I didn’t think you wanted tospeak to me.”Rearden stood alone, far at the other end of the room. Philip noticed him,approached and waved to Lillian, calling her over.“Lillian, I don’t think that Henry is having a good time,” he said, smiling; onecould not tell whether the mockery of his smile was directed at Lillian or atRearden. “Can’t we do something about it?”“Oh, nonsense!” said Rearden.“I wish I knew what to do about it, Philip,” said Lillian. “I’ve always wishedHenry would learn to relax. He’s so grimly serious about everything. He’s such arigid Puritan. I’ve always wanted to see him drunk, just once. But I’ve givenup. What would you suggest?”“Oh, I don’t know! But he shouldn’t be standing around all by himself.”“Drop it,” said Rearden. While thinking dimly that he did not want to hurt theirfeelings, he could not prevent himself from adding, “You don’t know how hardI’ve tried to be left standing all by myself.”“There—you see?” Lillian smiled at Philip. “To enjoy life and people is not sosimple as pouring a ton of steel. Intellectual pursuits are not learned in themarket place.”Philip chuckled. “It’s not intellectual pursuits I’m worried about. How sure areyou about that Puritan stuff, Lillian? If I were you, I wouldn’t leave him freeto look around. There are too many beautiful women here tonight.”“Henry entertaining thoughts of infidelity? You flatter him, Philip. Youoverestimate his courage.” She smiled at Rearden, coldly, for a brief, stressedmoment, then moved away.Rearden looked at his brother. “What in hell do you think you’re doing?”“Oh, stop playing the Puritan! Can’t you take a joke?”Moving aimlessly through the crowd, Dagny wondered why she had accepted theinvitation to this party. The answer astonished her: it was because she hadwanted to see Hank Rearden. Watching him in the crowd, she realized the contrastfor the first time. The faces of the others looked like aggregates ofinterchangeable features, every face oozing to blend into the anonymity ofresembling all, and all looking as if they were melting. Rearden’s face, withthe sharp planes, the pale blue eyes, the ash-blond hair, had the firmness ofice; the uncompromising clarity of its lines made it look, among the others, asif he were moving through a fog, hit by a ray of light.Her eyes kept returning to him involuntarily. She never caught him glancing inher direction. She could not believe that he was avoiding her intentionally;there could be no possible reason for it; yet she felt certain that he was. Shewanted to approach him and convince herself that she was mistaken. Somethingstopped her; she could not understand her own reluctance.Rearden bore patiently a conversation with his mother and two ladies whom shewished him to entertain with stories of his youth and his struggle. He complied,telling himself that she was proud of him in her own way. But he felt as ifsomething in her manner kept suggesting that she had nursed him through hisstruggle and that she was the source of his success. He was glad when she lethim go. Then he escaped once more to the recess of the window.He stood there for a while, leaning on a sense of privacy as if it were aphysical support.“Mr. Rearden,” said a strangely quiet voice beside him, “permit me to introducemyself. My name is d’Anconia.”Rearden turned, startled; d’Anconia’s manner and voice had a quality he hadseldom encountered before: a tone of authentic respect.“How do you do,” he answered. His voice was brusque and dry; but he hadanswered.“I have observed that Mrs. Rearden has been trying to avoid the necessity ofpresenting me to you, and I can guess the reason. Would you prefer that I leaveyour house?”The action of naming an issue instead of evading it, was so unlike the usualbehavior of all the men he knew, it was such a sudden, startling relief, thatRearden remained silent for a moment, studying d’Anconia’s face. Francisco hadsaid it very simply, neither as a reproach nor a plea, but in a manner which,strangely, acknowledged Rearden’s dignity and his own.“No,” said Rearden, “Whatever else you guessed, I did not say that.”“Thank you. In that case, you will allow me to speak to you.”“Why should you wish to speak to me?”“My motives cannot interest you at present.”“Mine is not the sort of conversation that could interest you at all.”“You are mistaken about one of us, Mr. Rearden, or both. I came to this partysolely in order to meet you.”There had been a faint tone of amusement in Rearden’s voice; now it hardenedinto a hint of contempt. “You started by playing it straight. Stick to it.”“I am.”“What did you want to meet me for? In order to make me lose money?”Francisco looked straight at him. “Yes—eventually.”“What is it, this time? A gold mine?”Francisco shook his head slowly; the conscious deliberation of the movement gaveit an air that was almost sadness. “No,” he said, “I don’t want to sell youanything. As a matter of fact, I did not attempt to sell the copper mine toJames Taggart, either. He came to me for it. You won’t.”Rearden chuckled. “If you understand that much, we have at least a sensiblebasis for conversation. Proceed on that. If you don’t have some fancy investmentin mind, what did you want to meet me for?”“In order to become acquainted with you.”“That’s not an answer. It’s just another way of saying the same thing.”“Not quite, Mr. Rearden.”“Unless you mean—in order to gain my confidence?”“No. I don’t like people who speak or think in terms of gaining anybody’sconfidence. If one’s actions are honest, one does not need the predatedconfidence of others, only their rational perception. The person who craves amoral blank check of that kind, has dishonest intentions, whether he admits itto himself or not.”Rearden’s startled glance at him was like the involuntary thrust of a handgrasping for support in a desperate need. The glance betrayed how much he wantedto find the sort of man he thought he was seeing. Then Rearden lowered his eyes,almost closing them, slowly, shutting out the vision and the need. His face washard; it had an expression of severity, an inner severity directed at himself;it looked austere and lonely.“All right,” he said tonelessly. “What do you want, if it’s not my confidence?”“I want to learn to understand you.”“What for?”“For a reason of my own which need not concern you at present.”“What do you want to understand about me?”Francisco looked silently out at the darkness. The fire of the mills was dyingdown. There was only a faint tinge of red left on the edge of the earth, justenough to outline the scraps of clouds ripped by the tortured battle of thestorm in the sky. Dim shapes kept sweeping through space and vanishing, shapeswhich were branches, but looked as if they were the fury of the wind madevisible.“It’s a terrible night for any animal caught unprotected on that plain,” saidFrancisco d’Anconia. “This is when one should appreciate the meaning of being aman.”Rearden did not answer for a moment; then he said, as if in answer to himself, atone of wonder in his voice, “Funny ...”“What?”“You told me what I was thinking just a while ago ...”“You were?”“... only I didn’t have the words for it.”“Shall I tell you the rest of the words?”“Go ahead.”“You stood here and watched the storm with the greatest pride one can everfeel—because you are able to have summer flowers and half-naked women in yourhouse on a night like this, in demonstration of your victory over that storm.And if it weren’t for you, most of those who are here would be left helpless atthe mercy of that wind in the middle of some such plain.”“How did you know that?”In time with his question, Rearden realized that it was not his thoughts thisman had named, but his most hidden, most personal emotion; and that he, whowould never confess his emotions to anyone, had confessed it in his question. Hesaw the faintest flicker in Francisco’s eyes, as of a smile or a check mark.“What would you know about a pride of that kind?” Rearden asked sharply, as ifthe contempt of the second question could erase the confidence of the first.“That is what I felt once, when I was young.”Rearden looked at him. There was neither mockery nor self-pity in Francisco’sface; the fine, sculptured planes and the clear, blue eyes held a quietcomposure, the face was open, offered to any blow, unflinching.“Why do you want to talk about it?” Rearden asked, prompted by a moment’sreluctant compassion.“Let us say—by way of gratitude, Mr. Rearden.”“Gratitude to me?”“If you will accept it.”Rearden’s voice hardened. “I haven’t asked for gratitude. I don’t need it.”“I have not said you needed it. But of all those whom you are saving from thestorm tonight, I am the only one who will offer it.”After a moment’s silence, Rearden asked, his voice low with a sound which wasalmost a threat, “What are you trying to do?”“I am calling your attention to the nature of those for whom you are working.”“It would take a man who’s never done an honest day’s work in his life, to thinkor say that.” The contempt in Rearden’s voice had a note of relief; he had beendisarmed by a doubt of his judgment on the character of his adversary; now hefelt certain once more. “You wouldn’t understand it if I told you that the manwho works, works for himself, even if he does carry the whole wretched bunch ofyou along. Now I’ll guess what you’re thinking: go ahead, say that it’s evil,that I’m selfish, conceited, heartless, cruel. I am. I don’t want any part ofthat tripe about working for others. I’m not.”For the first time, he saw the look of a personal reaction in Francisco’s eyes,the look of something eager and young. “The only thing that’s wrong in what yousaid,” Francisco answered, “is that you permit anyone to call it evil.” InRearden’s pause of incredulous silence, he pointed at the crowd in the drawingroom. “Why are you willing to carry them?”“Because they’re a bunch of miserable children who struggle to remain alive,desperately and very badly, while I—I don’t even notice the burden.”“Why don’t you tell them that?”“What?”“That you’re working for your own sake, not theirs.”“They know it.”“Oh yes, they know it. Every single one of them here knows it. But they don’tthink you do. And the aim of all their efforts is to keep you from knowing it.”“Why should I care what they think?”“Because it’s a battle in which one must make one’s stand clear.”“A battle? What battle? I hold the whip hand. I don’t fight the disarmed.”“Are they? They have a weapon against you. It’s their only weapon, but it’s aterrible one. Ask yourself what it is, some time.”“Where do you see any evidence of it?”“In the unforgivable fact that you’re as unhappy as you are.”Rearden could accept any form of reproach, abuse, damnation anyone chose tothrow at him: the only human reaction which he would not accept was pity. Thestab of a coldly rebellious anger brought him back to the full context of themoment. He spoke, fighting not to acknowledge the nature of the emotion risingwithin him. “What sort of effrontery are you indulging in? What’s your motive?”“Let us say—to give you the words you need, for the time when you’ll need them.”“Why should you want to speak to me on such a subject?”“In the hope that you will remember it.”What he felt, thought Rearden, was anger at the incomprehensible fact that hehad allowed himself to enjoy this conversation. He felt a dim sense of betrayal,the hint of an unknown danger. “Do you expect me to forget what you are?” heasked, knowing that this was what he had forgotten.“I do not expect you to think of me at all.”Under his anger, the emotion which Rearden would not acknowledge remainedunstated and unthought; he knew it only as a hint of pain. Had he faced it, hewould have known that he still heard Francisco’s voice saying, “I am the onlyone who will offer it... if you will accept it ....” He heard the words and thestrangely solemn inflection of the quiet voice and an inexplicable answer of hisown, something within him that wanted to cry yes, to accept, to tell this manthat he accepted, that he needed it—though there was no name for what he needed,it was not gratitude, and he knew that it was not gratitude this man had meant.Aloud, he said, “I didn’t seek to talk to you. But you’ve asked for it andyou’re going to hear it. To me, there’s only one form of human depravity—the manwithout a purpose.”“That is true.”“I can forgive all those others, they’re not vicious, they’re merely helpless.But you—you’re the kind who can’t be forgiven.”“It is against the sin of forgiveness that I wanted to warn you.”“You had the greatest chance in life. What have you done with it? If you havethe mind to understand all the things you said, how can you speak to me at all?How can you face anyone after the sort of irresponsible destruction you’veperpetrated in that Mexican business?”“It is your right to condemn me for it, if you wish.”Dagny stood by the corner of the window recess, listening. They did not noticeher. She had seen them together and she had approached, drawn by an impulse shecould not explain or resist; it seemed crucially important that she know whatthese two men said to each other.She had heard their last few sentences. She had never thought it possible thatshe would see Francisco taking a beating. He could smash any adversary in anyform of encounter. Yet he stood, offering no defense. She knew that it was notindifference; she knew his face well enough to see the effort his calm costhim—she saw the faint line of a muscle pulled tight across his cheek.“Of all those who live by the ability of others,” said Rearden, “you’re the onereal parasite.”“I have given you grounds to think so.”“Then what right have you to talk about the meaning of being a man? You’re theone who has betrayed it.”“I am sorry if I have offended you by what you may rightly consider as apresumption.”Francisco bowed and turned to go. Rearden said involuntarily, not knowing thatthe question negated his anger, that it was a plea to stop this man and holdhim, “What did you want to learn to understand about me?”Francisco turned. The expression of his face had not changed; it was still alook of gravely courteous respect. “I have learned it,” he answered.Rearden stood watching him as he walked off into the crowd. The figures of abutler, with a crystal dish, and of Dr. Pritchett, stooping to choose anothercanape, hid Francisco from sight. Rearden glanced out at the darkness; nothingcould be seen there but the wind.Dagny stepped forward, when he came out of the recess; she smiled, openlyinviting conversation. He stopped. It seemed to her that he had stoppedreluctantly. She spoke hastily, to break the silence. “Hank, why do you have somany intellectuals of the looter persuasion here? I wouldn’t have them in myhouse.”This was not what she had wanted to say to him. But she did not know what shewanted to say; never before had she felt herself left wordless in his presence.She saw his eyes narrowing, like a door being closed. “I see no reason why oneshould not invite them to a party,” he answered coldly.“Oh, I didn’t mean to criticize your choice of guests. But... Well, I’ve beentrying not to learn which one of them is Bertram Scudder. If I do, I’ll slap hisface.” She tried to sound casual. “I don’t want to create a scene, but I’m notsure I’ll be able to control myself. I couldn’t believe it when somebody told methat Mrs. Rearden had invited him.”“I invited him.”“But ...” Then her voice dropped. “Why?”“I don’t attach any importance to occasions of this kind.”“I’m sorry, Hank. 1 didn’t know you were so tolerant. I’m not.”He said nothing.“I know you don’t like parties. Neither do I. But sometimes I wonder ... perhapswe’re the only ones who were meant to be able to enjoy them.”“I am afraid I have no talent for it.”“Not for this. But do you think any of these people are enjoying it? They’rejust straining to be more senseless and aimless than usual. To be light andunimportant... You know, I think that only if one feels immensely important canone feel truly light.”“I wouldn’t know.”“It’s just a thought that disturbs me once in a while.... I thought it about myfirst ball.... I keep thinking that parties are intended to be celebrations, andcelebrations should be only for those who have something to celebrate.”“I have never thought of it.”She could not adapt her words to the rigid formality of his manner; she couldnot quite believe it. They had always been at ease together, in his office. Nowhe was like a man in a strait jacket.“Hank, look at it. If you didn’t know any of these people, wouldn’t it seembeautiful? The lights and the clothes and all the imagination that went to makeit possible ...” She was looking at the room. She did not notice that he had notfollowed her glance. He was looking down at the shadows on her naked shoulder,the soft, blue shadows made by the light that fell through the strands of herhair. “Why have we left it all to fools? It should have been ours.”“In what manner?”“I don’t know... I’ve always expected parties to be exciting and brilliant, likesome rare drink.” She laughed; there was a note of sadness in it. “But I don’tdrink, either. That’s just another symbol that doesn’t mean what it was intendedto mean.” He was silent. She added, “Perhaps there’s something that we havemissed.”“I am not aware of it.”In a flash of sudden, desolate emptiness, she was glad that he had notunderstood or responded, feeling dimly that she had revealed too much, yet notknowing what she had revealed. She shrugged, the movement running through thecurve of her shoulder like a faint convulsion. “It’s just an old illusion ofmine,” she said indifferently. “Just a mood that comes once every year or two.Let me see the latest steel price index and I’ll forget all about it.”She did not know that his eyes were following her, as she walked away from him.She moved slowly through the room, looking at no one. She noticed a small grouphuddled by the unlighted fireplace. The room was not cold, but they sat as ifthey drew comfort from the thought of a non-existent fire.“I do not know why, but I am growing to be afraid of the dark. No, not now, onlywhen I am alone. What frightens me is night. Night as such.”The speaker was an elderly spinster with an air of breeding and hopelessness.The three women and two men of the group were well dressed, the skin of theirfaces was smoothly well tended, but they had a manner of anxious caution thatkept their voices one tone lower than normal and blurred the differences oftheir ages, giving them all the same gray look of being spent. It was the lookone saw in groups of respectable people everywhere. Dagny stopped and listened.“But my dear,” one of them asked, “why should it frighten you?”“I don’t know,” said the spinster. “I am not afraid of prowlers or robberies oranything of the sort. But I stay awake all night. I fall asleep only when I seethe sky turning pale. It is very odd. Every evening, when it grows dark, I getthe feeling that this time it is final, that daylight will not return.”“My cousin who lives on the coast of Maine wrote me the same thing,” said one ofthe women.“Last night,” said the spinster, “I stayed awake because of the shooting. Therewere guns going off all night, way out at sea. There were no flashes. There wasnothing. Just those detonations, at long intervals, somewhere in the fog overthe Atlantic.”“I read something about it in the paper this morning. Coast Guard targetpractice.”“Why, no,” the spinster said indifferently. “Everybody down on the shore knowswhat it was. It was Ragnar Danneskjöld. It was the Coast Guard trying to catchhim.”“Ragnar Danneskjöld in Delaware Bay?” a woman gasped.“Oh, yes. They say it is not the first time.”“Did they catch him?”“No.”“Nobody can catch him,” said one of the men.“The People’s State of Norway has offered a million-dollar reward for his head.”“That’s an awful lot of money to pay for a pirate’s head.”“But how are we going to have any order or security or planning in the world,with a pirate running loose all over the seven seas?”“Do you know what it was that he seized last night?” said the spinster. “The bigship with the relief supplies we were sending to the People’s State of France.”“How does he dispose of the goods he seizes?”“Ah, that—nobody knows.”“I met a sailor once, from a ship he’d attacked, who’d seen him in person. Hesaid that Ragnar Danneskjöld has the purest gold hair and the most frighteningface on earth, a face with no sign of any feeling. If there ever was a man bornwithout a heart, he’s it—the sailor said.”“A nephew of mine saw Ragnar Danneskjöld’s ship one night, off the coast ofScotland. He wrote me that he couldn’t believe his eyes. It was a better shipthan any in the navy of the People’s State of England.”“They say he hides in one of those Norwegian fjords where neither God nor manwill ever find him. That’s where the Vikings used to hide in the Middle Ages.”“There’s a reward on his head offered by the People’s State of Portugal, too.And by the People’s State of Turkey.”“They say it’s a national scandal in Norway. He comes from one of their bestfamilies. The family lost its money generations ago, but the name is of thenoblest. The ruins of their castle are still in existence. His father is abishop. His father has disowned him and excommunicated him. But it had noeffect.”“Did you know that Ragnar Danneskjöld went to school in this country? Sure. ThePatrick Henry University.”“Not really?”“Oh yes. You can look it up.”“What bothers me is ... You know, I don’t like it. I don’t like it that he’s nowappearing right here, in our own waters. I thought things like that could happenonly in the wastelands. Only in Europe. But a big-scale outlaw of that kindoperating in Delaware in our day and age!”“He’s been seen off Nantucket, too. And at Bar Harbor. The newspapers have beenasked not to write about it.”“Why?”“They don’t want people to know that the navy can’t cope with him.”“I don’t like it. It feels funny. It’s like something out of the Dark Ages.”Dagny glanced up. She saw Francisco d’Anconia standing a few steps away. He waslooking at her with a kind of stressed curiosity; his eyes were mocking.“It’s a strange world we’re living in,” said the spinster, her voice low.“I read an article,” said one of the women tonelessly. “It said that times oftrouble are good for us. It is good that people are growing poorer. To acceptprivations is a moral virtue.”“I suppose so,” said another, without conviction.“We must not worry. I heard a speech that said it is useless to worry or toblame anyone. Nobody can help what he does, that is the way things made him.There is nothing we can do about anything. We must learn to bear it.”“What’s the use anyway? What is man’s fate? Hasn’t it always been to hope, butnever to achieve? The wise man is the one who does not attempt to hope.”“That is the right attitude to take.”“I don’t know... I don’t know what is right any more... How can we ever know?”“Oh well, who is John Galt?” [This was a popular expression denoting futility.]Dagny turned brusquely and started away from them. One of the women followedher.“But I do know it,” said the woman, in the soft, mysterious tone of sharing asecret.“You know what?”“I know who is John Galt.”“Who?” Dagny asked tensely, stopping.“I know a man who knew John Galt in person. This man is an old friend of agreat-aunt of mine. He was there and he saw it happen. Do you know the legend ofAtlantis, Miss Taggart?”“What?”“Atlantis.”“Why ... vaguely.”“The Isles of the Blessed. That is what the Greeks called it, thousands of yearsago. They said Atlantis was a place where hero-spirits lived in a happinessunknown to the rest of the earth. A place which only the spirits of heroes couldenter, and they reached it without dying, because they carried the secret oflife within them. Atlantis was lost to mankind, even then. But the Greeks knewthat it had existed. They tried to find it. Some of them said it wasunderground, hidden in the heart of the earth. But most of them said it was anisland. A radiant island in the Western Ocean. Perhaps what they were thinkingof was America. They never found it. For centuries afterward, men said it wasonly a legend. They did not believe it, but they never stopped looking for it,because they knew that that was what they had to find.”“Well, what about John Galt?”“He found it.”Dagny’s interest was gone. “Who was he?”“John Galt was a millionaire, a man of inestimable wealth. He was sailing hisyacht one night, in mid-Atlantic, fighting the worst storm ever wreaked upon theworld, when he found it. He saw it in the depth, where it had sunk to escape thereach of men. He saw the towers of Atlantis shining on the bottom of the ocean.It was a sight of such kind that when one had seen it, one could no longer wishto look at the rest of the earth. John Galt sank his ship and went down with hisentire crew. They all chose to do it. My friend was the only one who survived.”“How interesting.”“My friend saw it with his own eyes,” said the woman, offended. “It happenedmany years ago. But John Galt’s family hushed up the story.”“And what happened to his fortune? I don’t recall ever hearing of a Gaitfortune.”“It went down with him.” She added belligerently, “You don’t have to believeit.”“Miss Taggart doesn‘t,” said Francisco d’Anconia. “I do.”They turned. He had followed them and he stood looking at them with theinsolence of exaggerated earnestness.“Have you ever had faith in anything, Senor d’Anconia?” the woman asked angrily.“No, madame.”He chuckled at her brusque departure. Dagny asked coldly, “What’s the joke?”“The joke’s on that fool woman. She doesn’t know that she was telling you thetruth.”“Do you expect me to believe that?”“No.”“Then what do you find so amusing?”“Oh, a great many things here. Don’t you?”“No.”“Well, that’s one of the things I find amusing.”“Francisco, will you leave me alone?”“But I have. Didn’t you notice that you were first to speak to me tonight?”“Why do you keep watching me?”“Curiosity.”“About what?”“Your reaction to the things which you don’t find amusing.”“Why should you care about my reaction to anything?”“That is my own way of having a good time, which, incidentally, you are nothaving, are you, Dagny? Besides, you’re the only woman worth watching here.”She stood defiantly still, because the way he looked at her demanded an angryescape. She stood as she always did, straight and taut, her head liftedimpatiently. It was the unfeminine pose of an executive. But her naked shoulderbetrayed the fragility of the body under the black dress, and the pose made hermost truly a woman. The proud strength became a challenge to someone’s superiorstrength, and the fragility a reminder that the challenge could be broken. Shewas not conscious of it. She had met no one able to see it.He said, looking down at her body, “Dagny, what a magnificent waste!”She had to turn and escape. She felt herself blushing, for the first time inyears: blushing because she knew suddenly that the sentence named what she hadfelt all evening.She ran, trying not to think. The music stopped her. It was a sudden blast fromthe radio. She noticed Mort Liddy, who had turned it on, waving his arms to agroup of friends, yelling, “That’s it! That’s it! I want you to hear it!”The great burst of sound was the opening chords of Halley’s Fourth Concerto. Itrose in tortured triumph, speaking its denial of pain, its hymn to a distantvision. Then the notes broke. It was as if a handful of mud and pebbles had beenflung at the music, and what followed was the sound of the rolling and thedripping. It was Halley’s Concerto swung into a popular tune. It was Halley’smelody torn apart, its holes stuffed with hiccoughs. The great statement of joyhad become the giggling of a barroom. Yet it was still the remnant of Halley’smelody that gave it form; it was the melody that supported it like a spinalcord.“Pretty good?” Mort Liddy was smiling at his friends, boastfully and nervously.“Pretty good, eh? Best movie score of the year. Got me a prize. Got me along-term contract. Yeah, this was my score for Heaven’s in Your Backyard.”Dagny stood, staring at the room, as if one sense could replace another, as ifsight could wipe out sound. She moved her head in a slow circle, trying to findan anchor somewhere. She saw Francisco leaning against a column, his armscrossed; he was looking straight at her; he was laughing.Don’t shake like this, she thought. Get out of here. This was the approach of ananger she could not control. She thought: Say nothing. Walk steadily. Get out.She had started walking, cautiously, very slowly. She heard Lillian’s words andstopped. Lillian had said it many times this evening, in answer to the samequestion, but it was the first time that Dagny heard it.“This?” Lillian was saying, extending her arm with the metal bracelet for theinspection of two smartly groomed women. “Why, no, it’s not from a hardwarestore, it’s a very special gift from my husband. Oh, yes, of course it’shideous. But don’t you see? It’s supposed to be priceless. Of course, I’dexchange it for a common diamond bracelet any time, but somehow nobody willoffer me one for it, even though it is so very, very valuable. Why? My dear,it’s the first thing ever made of Rearden Metal.”Dagny did not see the room. She did not hear the music. She felt the pressure ofdead stillness against her eardrums. She did not know the moment that preceded,or the moments that were to follow. She did not know those involved, neitherherself, nor Lillian, nor Rearden, nor the meaning of her own action. It was asingle instant, blasted out of context. She had heard. She was looking at thebracelet of green-blue metal.She felt the movement of something being torn off her wrist, and she heard herown voice saying in the great stillness, very calmly, a voice cold as askeleton, naked of emotion, “If you are not the coward that I think you are, youwill exchange it.”On the palm of her hand, she was extending her diamond bracelet to Lillian.“You’re not serious, Miss Taggart?” said a woman’s voice.It was not Lillian’s voice. Lillian’s eyes were looking straight at her. She sawthem. Lillian knew that she was serious.“Give me that bracelet,” said Dagny, lifting her palm higher, the diamond bandglittering across it.“This is horrible!” cried some woman. It was strange that the cry stood out sosharply. Then Dagny realized that there were people standing around them andthat they all stood in silence. She was hearing sounds now, even the music; itwas Halley’s mangled Concerto, somewhere far away.She saw Rearden’s face. It looked as if something within him were mangled, likethe music; she did not know by what. He was watching them.Lillian’s mouth moved into an upturned crescent. It resembled a smile. Shesnapped the metal bracelet open, dropped it on Dagny’s palm and took the diamondband.“Thank you, Miss Taggart,” she said.Dagny’s fingers closed about the metal. She felt that; she felt nothing else.Lillian turned, because Rearden had approached her. He took the diamond braceletfrom her hand. He clasped it on her wrist, raised her hand to his lips andkissed it.He did not look at Dagny.Lillian laughed, gaily, easily, attractively, bringing the room back to itsnormal mood.“You may have it back, Miss Taggart, when you change your mind,” she said.Dagny had turned away. She felt calm and free. The pressure was gone. The needto get out had vanished.She clasped the metal bracelet on her wrist. She liked the feel of the weightagainst her skin. Inexplicably, she felt a touch of feminine vanity, the kindshe had never experienced before: the desire to be seen wearing this particularornament.From a distance, she heard snatches of indignant voices: “The most offensivegesture I’ve ever seen.... It was vicious.... I’m glad Lillian took her up onit.... Serves her right, if she feels like throwing a few thousand dollarsaway....”For the rest of the evening, Rearden remained by the side of his wife. He sharedher conversations, he laughed with her friends, he was suddenly the devoted,attentive, admiring husband.He was crossing the room, carrying a tray of drinks requested by someone inLillian’s group—an unbecoming act of informality which nobody had ever seen himperform—when Dagny approached him. She stopped and looked up at him, as if theywere alone in his office. She stood like an executive, her head lifted. Helooked down at her. In the line of his glance, from the fingertips of her onehand to her face, her body was naked but for his metal bracelet.“I’m sorry, Hank,” she said, “but I had to do it.”His eyes remained expressionless. Yet she was suddenly certain that she knewwhat he felt: he wanted to slap her face.“It was not necessary,” he answered coldly, and walked on.018 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_018_r1.jpg]It was very late when Rearden entered his wife’s bedroom. She was still awake. Alamp burned on her bedside table.She lay in bed, propped up on pillows of pale green linen. Her bed-jacket waspale green satin, worn with the untouched perfection of a window model; itslustrous folds looked as if the crinkle of tissue paper still lingered amongthem. The light, shaded to a tone of apple blossoms, fell on a table that held abook, a glass of fruit juice, and toilet accessories of silver glittering likeinstruments in a surgeon’s case. Her arms had a tinge of porcelain. There was atouch of pale pink lipstick on her mouth. She showed no sign of exhaustion afterthe party—no sign of life to be exhausted. The place was a decorator’s displayof a lady groomed for sleep, not to be disturbed.He still wore his dress clothes; his tie was loose, and a strand of hair hungover his face. She glanced at him without astonishment, as if she knew what thelast hour in his room had done to him.He looked at her silently. He had not entered her room for a long time. Hestood, wishing he had not entered it now.“Isn’t it customary to talk, Henry?”“If you wish.”“I wish you’d send one of your brilliant experts from the mills to take a lookat our furnace. Do you know that it went out during the party and Simons had aterrible time getting it started again?... Mrs. Weston says that our bestachievement is our cook—she loved the hors d‘oeuvres.... Balph Eubank said avery funny thing about you, he said you’re a crusader with a factory’s chimneysmoke for a plume.... I’m glad you don’t like Francisco d’Anconia. I can’t standhim.”He did not care to explain his presence, or to disguise defeat, or to admit itby leaving. Suddenly, it did not matter to him what she guessed or felt. Hewalked to the window and stood, looking out.Why had she married him?—he thought. It was a question he had not asked himselfon their wedding day, eight years ago. Since then, in tortured loneliness, hehad asked it many times. He had found no answer.It was not for position, he thought, or for money. She came from an old familythat had both. Her family’s name was not among the most distinguished and theirfortune was modest, but both were sufficient to let her be included in the topcircles of New York’s society, where he had met her. Nine years ago, he hadappeared in New York like an explosion, in the glare of the success of ReardenSteel, a success that had been thought impossible by the city’s experts. It washis indifference that made him spectacular. He did not know that he was expectedto attempt to buy his way into society and that they anticipated the pleasure ofrejecting him. He had no time to notice their disappointment.He attended, reluctantly, a few social occasions to which he was invited by menwho sought his favor. He did not know, but they knew, that his courteouspoliteness was condescension toward the people who had expected to snub him, thepeople who had said that the age of achievement was past.It was Lillian’s austerity that attracted him—the conflict between her austerityand her behavior. He had never liked anyone or expected to be liked. He foundhimself held by the spectacle of a woman who was obviously pursuing him but withobvious reluctance, as if against her own will, as if fighting a desire sheresented. It was she who planned that they should meet, then faced him coldly,as if not caring that he knew it. She spoke little; she had an air of mysterythat seemed to tell him he would never break through her proud detachment, andan air of amusement, mocking her own desire and his.He had not known many women. He had moved toward his goal, sweeping asideeverything that did not pertain to it in the world and in himself. Hisdedication to his work was like one of the fires he dealt with, a fire thatburned every lesser element, every impurity out of the white stream of a singlemetal. He was incapable of halfway concerns. But there were times when he felt asudden access of desire, so violent that it could not be given to a casualencounter. He had surrendered to it, on a few rare occasions through the years,with women he had thought he liked. He had been left feeling an angryemptiness—because he had sought an act of triumph, though he had not known ofwhat nature, but the response he received was only a woman’s acceptance of acasual pleasure, and he knew too clearly that what he had won had no meaning. Hewas left, not with a sense of attainment, but with a sense of his owndegradation. He grew to hate his desire. He fought it. He came to believe thedoctrine that this desire was wholly physical, a desire, not of consciousness,but of matter, and he rebelled against the thought that his flesh could be freeto choose and that its choice was impervious to the will of his mind. He hadspent his life in mines and mills, shaping matter to his wishes by the power ofhis brain—and he found it intolerable that he should be unable to control thematter of his own body. He fought it. He had won his every battle againstinanimate nature; but this was a battle he lost.It was the difficulty of the conquest that made him want Lillian. She seemed tobe a woman who expected and deserved a pedestal; this made him want to drag herdown to his bed. To drag her down, were the words in his mind; they gave him adark pleasure, the sense of a victory worth winning.He could not understand why—he thought it was an obscene conflict, the sigh ofsome secret depravity within him—why he felt, at the same time, a profound prideat the thought of granting to a woman the title of his wife. The feeling wassolemn and shining; it was almost as if he felt that he wished to honor a womanby the act of possessing her. Lillian seemed to fit the image he had not knownhe held, had not known he wished to find; he saw the grace, the pride, thepurity; the rest was in himself; he did not know that he was looking at areflection.He remembered the day when Lillian came from New York to his office, of her ownsudden choice, and asked him to take her through his mills. He heard a soft,low, breathless tone—the tone of admiration—growing in her voice, as shequestioned him about his work and looked at the place around her. He looked ather graceful figure moving against the bursts of furnace flame, and at the lightswift steps of her high heels stumbling through drifts of slag, as she walkedresolutely by his side. The look in her eyes, when she watched a heat of steelbeing poured, was like his own feeling for it made visible to him. When her eyesmoved up to his face, he saw the same look, but intensified to a degree thatseemed to make her helpless and silent. It was at dinner, that evening, that heasked her to marry him.It took him some time after his marriage before he admitted to himself that thiswas torture. He still remembered the night when he admitted it, when he toldhimself—the veins of his wrists pulled tight as he stood by the bed, lookingdown at Lillian—that he deserved the torture and that he would endure it.Lillian was not looking at him; she was adjusting her hair. “May I go to sleepnow?” she asked.She had never objected; she had never refused him anything; she submittedwhenever he wished. She submitted in the manner of complying with the rule thatit was, at times, her duty to become an inanimate object turned over to herhusband’s use.She did not censure him. She made it clear that she took it for granted that menhad degrading instincts which constituted the secret, ugly part of marriage. Shewas condescendingly tolerant. She smiled, in amused distaste, at the intensityof what he experienced. “It’s the most undignified pastime I know of,” she saidto him once, “but I have never entertained the illusion that men are superior toanimals.”His desire for her had died in the first week of their marriage. What remainedwas only a need which he was unable to destroy. He had never entered awhorehouse; he thought, at times, that the self-loathing he would experiencethere could be no worse than what he felt when he was driven to enter his wife’sbedroom.He would often find her reading a book. She would put it aside, with a whiteribbon to mark the pages. When he lay exhausted, his eyes closed, stillbreathing in gasps, she would turn on the light, pick up the book and continueher reading.He told himself that he deserved the torture, because he had wished never totouch her again and was unable to maintain his decision. He despised himself forthat. He despised a need which now held no shred of joy or meaning, which hadbecome the mere need of a woman’s body, an anonymous body that belonged to awoman whom he had to forget while he held it. He became convinced that the needwas depravity.He did not condemn Lillian. He felt a dreary, indifferent respect for her. Hishatred of his own desire had made him accept the doctrine that women were pureand that a pure woman was one incapable of physical pleasure.Through the quiet agony of the years of his marriage, there had been one thoughtwhich he would not permit himself to consider: the thought of infidelity. He hadgiven his word. He intended to keep it. It was not loyalty to Lillian; it wasnot the person of Lillian that he wished to protect from dishonor—but the personof his wife.He thought of that now, standing at the window. He had not wanted to enter herroom. He had fought against it. He had fought, more fiercely, against knowingthe particular reason why he would not be able to withstand it tonight. Then,seeing her, he had known suddenly that he would not touch her. The reason whichhad driven him here tonight was the reason which made it impossible for him.He stood still, feeling free of desire, feeling the bleak relief of indifferenceto his body, to this room, even to his presence here. He had turned away fromher, not to see her lacquered chastity. What he thought he should feel wasrespect; what he felt was revulsion.“... but Dr. Pritchett said that our culture is dying because our universitieshave to depend on the alms of the meat packers, the steel puddlers and thepurveyors of breakfast cereals.”Why had she married him?—he thought. That bright, crisp voice was not talking atrandom. She knew why he had come here. She knew what it would do to him to seeher pick up a silver buffer and go on talking gaily, polishing her fingernails.She was talking about the party. But she did not mention Bertram Scudder—orDagny Taggart.What had she sought in marrying him? He felt the presence of some cold, drivingpurpose within her—but found nothing to condemn. She had never tried to use him.She made no demands on him. She found no satisfaction in the prestige ofindustrial power—she spurned it—she preferred her own circle of friends. She wasnot after money—she spent little—she was indifferent to the kind of extravagancehe could have afforded. He had no right to accuse her, he thought, or ever tobreak the bond. She was a woman of honor in their marriage. She wanted nothingmaterial from him.He turned and looked at her wearily.“Next time you give a party,” he said, “stick to your own crowd. Don’t invitewhat you think are my friends. I don’t care to meet them socially.”She laughed, startled and pleased. “I don’t blame you, darling,” she said.He walked out, adding nothing else.What did she want from him?—he thought. What was she after? In the universe ashe knew it, there was no answer.019 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_019_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: About a hundred pages later, we witness the first run of the JohnGalt Line, Dagny Taggart’s new railroad, which services the wells of oil baronEllis Wyatt. The rail and a new bridge, both made of Rearden Metal, have beenwidely denounced by social critics as unsafe; the critics predict a disastrouscrash when the train reaches the bridge."},{"pageContent":"The John Galt LineREARDEN WAS in New York on the day when Dagny telephoned him from her office.“Hank, I’m going to have a press conference tomorrow.”He laughed aloud. “No!”“Yes.” Her voice sounded earnest, but, dangerously, a bit too earnest. “Thenewspapers have suddenly discovered me and are asking questions. I’m going toanswer them.”“Have a good time.”“I will. Are you going to be in town tomorrow? I’d like to have you in on it.”“Okay. I wouldn’t want to miss it.”The reporters who came to the press conference in the office of the John GaltLine were young men who had been trained to think that their job consisted ofconcealing from the world the nature of its events. It was their daily duty toserve as audience for some public figure who made utterances about the publicgood, in phrases carefully chosen to convey no meaning. It was their daily jobto sling words together in any combination they pleased, so long as the wordsdid not fall into a sequence saying something specific. They could notunderstand the interview now being given to them.Dagny Taggart sat behind her desk in an office that looked like a slum basement.She wore a dark blue suit with a white blouse, beautifully tailored, suggestingan air of formal, almost military elegance. She sat straight, and her manner wasseverely dignified, just a shade too dignified.Rearden sat in a corner of the room, sprawled across a broken armchair, his longlegs thrown over one of its arms, his body leaning against the other. His mannerwas pleasantly informal, just a bit too informal.In the clear, monotonous voice of a military report, consulting no papers,looking straight at the men, Dagny recited the technological facts about theJohn Galt Line, giving exact figures on the nature of the rail, the capacity ofthe bridge, the method of construction, the costs. Then, in the dry tone of abanker, she explained the financial prospects of the Line and named the largeprofits she expected to make. “That is all,” she said.“All?” said one of the reporters. “Aren’t you going to give us a message for thepublic?”“That was my message.”“But hell—I mean, aren’t you going to defend yourself?”“Against what?”“Don’t you want to tell us something to justify your Line?”“I have.”A man with a mouth shaped as a permanent sneer asked, “Well, what I want toknow, as Bertram Scudder stated, is what protection do we have against your Linebeing no good?”“Don’t ride on it.”Another asked, “Aren’t you going to tell us your motive for building that Line?”“I have told you: the profit which I expect to make.”“Oh, Miss Taggart, don’t say that!” cried a young boy. He was new, he was stillhonest about his job, and he felt that he liked Dagny Taggart, without knowingwhy. “That’s the wrong thing to say. That’s what they’re all saying about you.”“Are they?”“I’m sure you didn’t mean it the way it sounds and ... and I’m sure you’ll wantto clarify it.”“Why, yes, if you wish me to. The average profit of railroads has been two percent of the capital invested. An industry that does so much and keeps so little,should consider itself immoral. As I have explained, the cost of the John GaltLine in relation to the traffic which it will carry makes me expect a profit ofnot less than fifteen per cent on our investment. Of course, any industrialprofit above four per cent is considered usury nowadays. I shall, nevertheless,do my best to make the John Galt Line earn a profit of twenty per cent for me,if possible. That was my motive for building the Line. Have I made myself clearnow?”The boy was looking at her helplessly. “You don’t mean, to earn a profit foryou, Miss Taggart? You mean, for the small stockholders, of course?” he promptedhopefully.“Why, no. I happen to be one of the largest stockholders of TaggartTranscontinental, so my share of the profits will be one of the largest. Now,Mr. Rearden is in a much more fortunate position, because he has no stockholdersto share with—or would you rather make your own statement, Mr. Rearden?”“Yes, gladly,” said Rearden. “Inasmuch as the formula of Rearden Metal is my ownpersonal secret, and in view of the fact that the Metal costs much less toproduce than you boys can imagine, I expect to skin the public to the tune of aprofit of twenty-five per cent in the next few years.”“What do you mean, skin the public, Mr. Rearden?” asked the boy. “If it’s true,as I’ve read in your ads, that your Metal will last three times longer than anyother and at half the price, wouldn’t the public be getting a bargain?”“Oh, have you noticed that?” said Rearden.“Do the two of you realize you’re talking for publication?” asked the man withthe sneer.“But, Mr. Hopkins,” said Dagny, in polite astonishment, “is there any reason whywe would talk to you, if it weren’t for publication?”“Do you want us to quote all the things you said?”“I hope I may trust you to be sure and quote them. Would you oblige me by takingthis down verbatim?” She paused to see their pencils ready, then dictated: “MissTaggart says—quote—I expect to make a pile of money on the John Galt Line. Iwill have earned it. Close quote. Thank you so much.”“Any questions, gentlemen?” asked Rearden.There were no questions. “Now I must tell you about the opening of the John GaltLine,” said Dagny. “The first train will depart from the station of TaggartTranscontinental in Cheyenne, Wyoming, at four P.M. on July twenty-second. Itwill be a freight special, consisting of eighty cars. It will be driven by aneight-thousand-horsepower, four-unit Diesel locomotive—which I’m leasing fromTaggart Transcontinental for the occasion. It will run non-stop to WyattJunction, Colorado, traveling at an average speed of one hundred miles per hour.I beg your pardon?” she asked, hearing the long, low sound of a whistle.“What did you say, Miss Taggart?”“I said, one hundred miles per hour—grades, curves and all.”“But shouldn’t you cut the speed below normal rather than ... Miss Taggart,don’t you have any consideration whatever for public opinion?”“But I do. If it weren’t for public opinion, an average speed of sixtyfive milesper hour would have been quite sufficient.”“Who’s going to run that train?”“I had quite a bit of trouble about that. All the Taggart engineers volunteeredto do it. So did the firemen, the brakemen and the conductors. We had to drawlots for every job on the train’s crew. The engineer will be Pat Logan, of theTaggart Comet, the fireman—Ray McKim. I shall ride in the cab of the engine withthem.”“Not really!”“Please do attend the opening. It’s on July twenty-second. The press is mosteagerly invited. Contrary to my usual policy, I have become a publicity hound.Really. I should like to have spotlights, radio microphones and televisioncameras. I suggest that you plant a few cameras around the bridge. The collapseof the bridge would give you some interesting shots.”“Miss Taggart,” asked Rearden, “why didn’t you mention that I’m going to ride inthat engine, too?”She looked at him across the room, and for a moment they were alone, holdingeach other’s glance.“Yes, of course, Mr. Rearden,” she answered.020 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_020_r1.jpg]She did not see him again until they looked at each other across the platform ofthe Taggart station in Cheyenne, on July 22.She did not look for anyone when she stepped out on the platform: she felt as ifher senses had merged, so that she could not distinguish the sky, the sun or thesounds of an enormous crowd, but perceived only a sensation of shock and light.Yet he was the first person she saw, and she could not tell for how long a timehe was also the only one. He stood by the engine of the John Galt train, talkingto somebody outside the field of her consciousness. He was dressed in grayslacks and shirt, he looked like an expert mechanic, but he was stared at by thefaces around him, because he was Hank Rearden of Rearden Steel. High above him,she saw the letters TT on the silver front of the engine. The lines of theengine slanted back, aimed at space.There was distance and a crowd between them, but his eyes moved to her themoment she came out. They looked at each other and she knew that he felt as shedid. This was not to be a solemn venture upon which their future depended, butsimply their day of enjoyment. Their work was done. For the moment, there was nofuture. They had earned the present.Only if one feels immensely important, she had told him, can one feel trulylight. Whatever the train’s run would mean to others, for the two of them theirown persons were this day’s sole meaning. Whatever it was that others sought inlife, their right to what they now felt was all the two of them wished to find.It was as if, across the platform, they said it to each other.Then she turned away from him.She noticed that she, too, was being stared at, that there were people aroundher, that she was laughing and answering questions.She had not expected such a large crowd. They filled the platform, the tracks,the square beyond the station; they were on the roofs of the boxcars on thesidings, at the windows of every house in sight. Something had drawn them here,something in the air which, at the last moment, had made James Taggart want toattend the opening of the John Galt Line. She had forbidden it. “If you come,Jim,” she had said, “I’ll have you thrown out of your own Taggart station. Thisis one event you’re not going to see.” Then she had chosen Eddie Willers torepresent Taggart Transcontinental at the opening.She looked at the crowd and she felt, simultaneously, astonishment that theyshould stare at her, when this event was so personally her own that nocommunication about it was possible, and a sense of fitness that they should behere, that they should want to see it, because the sight of an achievement wasthe greatest gift a human being could offer to others.She felt no anger toward anyone on earth. The things she had endured had nowreceded into some outer fog, like pain that still exists, but has no power tohurt. Those things could not stand in the face of this moment’s reality, themeaning of this day was as brilliantly, violently clear as the splashes of sunon the silver of the engine, all men had to perceive it now, no one could doubtit and she had no one to hate.Eddie Willers was watching her. He stood on the platform, surrounded by Taggartexecutives, division heads, civic leaders, and the various local officials whohad been outargued, bribed or threatened, to obtain permits to run a trainthrough town zones at a hundred miles an hour. For once, for this day and event,his title of Vice-President was real to him and he carried it well. But while hespoke to those around him, his eyes kept following Dagny through the crowd. Shewas dressed in blue slacks and shirt, she was unconscious of official duties,she had left them to him, the train was now her sole concern, as if she wereonly a member of its crew.She saw him, she approached, and she shook his hand; her smile was like asummation of all the things they did not have to say. “Well, Eddie, you’reTaggart Transcontinental now.”“Yes,” he said solemnly, his voice low [...]He watched from a distance while the train’s crew was lined up in front of theengine, to face a firing squad of cameras. Dagny and Rearden were smiling, as ifposing for snapshots of a summer vacation. Pat Logan, the engineer, a short,sinewy man with graying hair and a contemptuously inscrutable face, posed in amanner of amused indifference. Ray McKim, the fireman, a husky young giant,grinned with an air of embarrassment and superiority together. The rest of thecrew looked as if they were about to wink at the cameras. A photographer said,laughing, “Can’t you people look doomed, please? I know that’s what the editorwants.”Dagny and Rearden were answering questions for the press. There was no mockeryin their answers now, no bitterness. They were enjoying it. They spoke as if thequestions were asked in good faith. Irresistibly, at some point which no onenoticed, this became true.“What do you expect to happen on this run?” a reporter asked one of thebrakemen. “Do you think you’ll get there?”“I think we’ll get there,” said the brakeman, “and so do you, brother.”“Mr. Logan, do you have any children? Did you take out any extra insurance? I’mjust thinking of the bridge, you know.”“Don’t cross that bridge till I come to it,” Pat Logan answered contemptuously.“Mr. Rearden, how do you know that your rail will hold?”“The man who taught people to make a printing press,” said Rearden, “how did heknow it?”“Tell me, Miss Taggart, what’s going to support a seven-thousand-ton train on athree-thousand-ton bridge?”“My judgment,” she answered.The men of the press, who despised their own profession, did not know why theywere enjoying it today. One of them, a young man with years of notorious successbehind him and a cynical look of twice his age, said suddenly, “I know what I’dlike to be: I wish I could be a man who covers news!”The hands of the clock on the station building stood at 3:45. The crew startedoff toward the caboose at the distant end of the train. The movement and noiseof the crowd were subsiding. Without conscious intention, people were beginningto stand still.The dispatcher had received word from every local operator along the line ofrail that wound through the mountains to the Wyatt oil fields three hundredmiles away. He came out of the station building and, looking at Dagny, gave thesignal for clear track ahead. Standing by the engine, Dagny raised her hand,repeating his gesture in sign of an order received and understood.The long line of boxcars stretched off into the distance, in spaced, rectangularlinks, like a spinal cord. When the conductor’s arm swept through the air, farat the end, she moved her arm in answering signal.Rearden, Logan and McKim stood silently, as if at attention, letting her befirst to get aboard. As she started up the rungs on the side of the engine, areporter thought of a question he had not asked.“Miss Taggart,” he called after her, “who is John Galt?”She turned, hanging onto a metal bar with one hand, suspended for an instantabove the heads of the crowd.“We are!” she answered.Logan followed her into the cab, then McKim; Rearden went last, then the door ofthe engine was shut, with the tight finality of sealed metal.The lights, hanging on a signal bridge against the sky, were green. There weregreen lights between the tracks, low over the ground, dropping off into thedistance where the rails turned and a green light stood at the curve, againstleaves of a summer green that looked as if they, too, were lights.Two men held a white silk ribbon stretched across the track in front of theengine. They were the superintendent of the Colorado Division and Nealy’s chiefengineer, who had remained on the job.Eddie Willers was to cut the ribbon they held and thus to open the new line.The photographers posed him carefully, scissors in hand, his back to the engine.He would repeat the ceremony two or three times, they explained, to give them achoice of shots; they had a fresh bolt of ribbon ready. He was about to comply,then stopped. “No,” he said suddenly. “It’s not going to be a phony.”In a voice of quiet authority, the voice of a vice-president, he ordered,pointing at the cameras, “Stand back—way back. Take one shot when I cut it, thenget out of the way, fast.”They obeyed, moving hastily farther down the track. There was only one minuteleft. Eddie turned his back to the cameras and stood between the rails, facingthe engine. He held the scissors ready over the white ribbon. He took his hatoff and tossed it aside. He was looking up at the engine. A faint wind stirredhis blond hair. The engine was a great silver shield bearing the emblem of NatTaggart.Eddie Willers raised his hand as the hand of the station clock reached theinstant of four.“Open her up, Pat!” he called.In the moment when the engine started forward, he cut the white ribbon andleaped out of the way.From the side track, he saw the window of the cab go by and Dagny waving to himin an answering salute. Then the engine was gone, and he stood looking across atthe crowded platform that kept appearing and vanishing as the freight carsclicked past him.021 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_021_r1.jpg]The green-blue rails ran to meet them, like two jets shot out of a single pointbeyond the curve of the earth. The crossties melted, as they approached, into asmooth stream rolling down under the wheels. A blurred streak clung to the sideof the engine, low over the ground. Trees and telegraph poles sprang into sightabruptly and went by as if jerked back. The green plains stretched past, in aleisurely flow. At the edge of the sky, a long wave of mountains reversed themovement and seemed to follow the train.She felt no wheels under the floor. The motion was a smooth flight on asustained impulse, as if the engine hung above the rails, riding a current. Shefelt no speed. It seemed strange that the green lights of the signals keptcoming at them and past, every few seconds. She knew that the signal lights werespaced two miles apart.The needle on the speedometer in front of Pat Logan stood at one hundred.She sat in the fireman’s chair and glanced across at Logan once in a while. Hesat slumped forward a little, relaxed, one hand resting lightly on the throttleas if by chance; but his eyes were fixed on the track ahead. He had the ease ofan expert, so confident that it seemed casual, but it was the ease of atremendous concentration, the concentration on one’s task that has theruthlessness of an absolute. Ray McKim sat on a bench behind them. Rearden stoodin the middle of the cab.He stood, hands in pockets, feet apart, braced against the motion, lookingahead. There was nothing he could now care to see by the side of the track: hewas looking at the rail.Ownership—she thought, glancing back at him—weren’t there those who knew nothingof its nature and doubted its reality? No, it was not made of papers, seals,grants and permissions. There it was—in his eyes.The sound filling the cab seemed part of the space they were crossing. It heldthe low drone of the motors—the sharper clicking of the many parts that rang invaried cries of metat—and the high, thin chimes of trembling glass panes.Things streaked past—a water tank, a tree, a shanty, a grain silo. They had awindshield-wiper motion: they were rising, describing a curve and dropping back.The telegraph wires ran a race with the train, rising and falling from pole topole, in an even rhythm, like the cardiograph record of a steady heartbeatwritten across the sky.She looked ahead, at the haze that melted rail and distance, a haze that couldrip apart at any moment to some shape of disaster. She wondered why she feltsafer than she had ever felt in a car behind the engine, safer here, where itseemed as if, should an obstacle rise, her breast and the glass shield would befirst to smash against it. She smiled, grasping the answer: it was the securityof being first, with full sight and full knowledge of one’s course—not the blindsense of being pulled into the unknown by some unknown power ahead. It was thegreatest sensation of existence: not to trust, but to know.The glass sheets of the cab’s windows made the spread of the fields seem vaster:the earth looked as open to movement as it was to sight. Yet nothing was distantand nothing was out of reach. She had barely grasped the sparkle of a lakeahead—and in the next instant she was beside it, then past.It was a strange foreshortening between sight and touch, she thought, betweenwish and fulfillment, between—the words clicked sharply in her mind after astartled stop—between spirit and body. First, the vision—then the physical shapeto express it. First, the thought—then the purposeful motion down the straightline of a single track to a chosen goal. Could one have any meaning without theother? Wasn’t it evil to wish without moving—or to move without aim? Whosemalevolence was it that crept through the world, struggling to break the twoapart and set them against each other?She shook her head. She did not want to think or to wonder why the world behindher was as it was. She did not care. She was flying away from it, at the rate ofa hundred miles an hour. She leaned to the open window by her side, and felt thewind of the speed blowing her hair off her forehead. She lay back, conscious ofnothing but the pleasure it gave her.Yet her mind kept racing. Broken bits of thought flew past her attention, likethe telegraph poles by the track. Physical pleasure?—she thought. This is atrain made of steel ... running on rails of Rearden Metal ... moved by theenergy of burning oil and electric generators ... it’s a physical sensation ofphysical movement through space ... but is that the cause and the meaning ofwhat I now feel? ... Do they call it a low, animal joy—this feeling that I wouldnot care if the rail did break to bits under us now—it won’t—but! I wouldn’tcare, because I have experienced this? A low, physical, material, degradingpleasure of the body?She smiled, her eyes closed, the wind streaming through her hair.She opened her eyes and saw that Rearden stood looking down at her. It was thesame glance with which he had looked at the rail. She felt her power of volitionknocked out by some single, dull blow that made her unable to move. She held hiseyes, lying back in her chair, the wind pressing the thin cloth of her shirt toher body.He looked away, and she turned again to the sight of the earth tearing openbefore them.She did not want to think, but the sound of thought went on, like the drone ofthe motors under the sounds of the engine. She looked at the cab around her. Thefine steel mesh of the ceiling, she thought, and the row of rivets in thecorner, holding sheets of steel sealed together—who made them? The brute forceof men’s muscles ? Who made it possible for four dials and three levers in frontof Pat Logan to hold the incredible power of the sixteen motors behind them anddeliver it to the effortless control of one man’s hand?These things and the capacity from which they came—was this the pursuit menregarded as evil? Was this what they called an ignoble concern with the physicalworld? Was this the state of being enslaved by matter? Was this the surrender ofman’s spirit to his body?She shook her head, as if she wished she could toss the subject out of thewindow and let it get shattered somewhere along the track. She looked at the sunon the summer fields. She did not have to think, because these questions wereonly details of a truth she knew and had always known. Let them go past like thetelegraph poles. The thing she knew was like the wires flying above in anunbroken line. The words for it, and for this journey, and for her feeling, andfor the whole of man’s earth, were: It’s so simple and so right!She looked out at the country. She had been aware for some time of the humanfigures that flashed with an odd regularity at the side of the track. But theywent by so fast that she could not grasp their meaning until, like the squaresof a movie film, brief flashes blended into a whole and she understood it. Shehad had the track guarded since its completion, but she had not hired the humanchain she saw strung out along the right-of-way. A solitary figure stood atevery mile post. Some were young schoolboys, others were so old that thesilhouettes of their bodies looked bent against the sky. All of them were armed,with anything they had found, from costly rifles to ancient muskets. All of themwore railroad caps. They were the sons of Taggart employees, and old railroadmen who had retired after a full lifetime of Taggart service. They had come,unsummoned, to guard this train. As the engine went past him, every man in histurn stood erect, at attention, and raised his gun in a military salute.When she grasped it, she burst out laughing, suddenly, with the abruptness of acry. She laughed, shaking, like a child; it sounded like sobs of deliverance.Pat Logan nodded to her with a faint smile; he had noted the guard of honor longago. She leaned to the open window, and her arm swept in wide curves of triumph,waving to the men by the track.On the crest of a distant hill, she saw a crowd of people, their arms swingingagainst the sky. The gray houses of a village were scattered through a valleybelow, as if dropped there once and forgotten; the roof lines slanted, sagging,and the years had washed away the color of the walls. Perhaps generations hadlived there, with nothing to mark the passage of their days but the movement ofthe sun from east to west. Now, these men had climbed the hill to see asilver-headed comet cut through their plains like the sound of a bugle through along weight of silence.As houses began to come more frequently, closer to the track, she saw people atthe windows, on the porches, on distant roofs. She saw crowds blocking the roadsat grade crossings. The roads went sweeping past like the spokes of a fan, andshe could not distinguish human figures, only their arms greeting the train likebranches waving in the wind of its speed. They stood under the swinging redlights of warning signals, under the signs saying: “Stop. Look. Listen.”The station past which they flew, as they went through a town at a hundred milesan hour, was a swaying sculpture of people from platform to roof. She caught theflicker of waving arms, of hats tossed in the air, of something flung againstthe side of the engine, which was a bunch of flowers.As the miles clicked past them, the towns went by, with the stations at whichthey did not stop, with the crowds of people who had come only to see, to cheerand to hope. She saw garlands of flowers under the sooted eaves of old stationbuildings, and bunting of red-white-and-blue on the time-eaten walls. It waslike the pictures she had seen—and envied—in schoolbook histories of railroads,from the era when people gathered to greet the first run of a train. It was likethe age when Nat Taggart moved across the country, and the stops along his waywere marked by men eager for the sight of achievement. That age, she hadthought, was gone; generations had passed, with no event to greet anywhere, withnothing to see but the cracks lengthening year by year on the walls built by NatTaggart. Yet men came again, as they had come in his time, drawn by the sameresponse.She glanced at Rearden. He stood against the wall, unaware of the crowds,indifferent to admiration. He was watching the performance of track and trainwith an expert’s intensity of professional interest, his bearing suggested thathe would kick aside, as irrelevant, any thought such as “They like it,” when thethought ringing in his mind was “It works!”His tall figure in the single gray of slacks and shirt looked as if his bodywere stripped for action. The slacks stressed the long lines of his legs, thelight, firm posture of standing without effort or being ready to swing forwardat an instant’s notice; the short sleeves stressed the gaunt strength of hisarms; the open shirt bared the tight skin of his chest.She turned away, realizing suddenly that she had been glancing back at him toooften. But this day had no ties to past or future—her thoughts were cut off fromimplications—she saw no further meaning, only the immediate intensity of thefeeling that she was imprisoned with him, sealed together in the same cube ofair, the closeness of his presence underscoring her awareness of this day, ashis rails underscored the flight of the train.She turned deliberately and glanced back. He was looking at her. He did not turnaway, but held her glance, coldly and with full intention. She smiled defiantly,not letting herself know the full meaning of her smile, knowing only that it wasthe sharpest blow she could strike at this inflexible face. She felt a suddendesire to see him trembling, to tear a cry out of him. She turned her head away,slowly, feeling a reckless amusement, wondering why she found it difficult tobreathe.She sat leaning back in her chair, looking ahead, knowing that he was as awareof her as she was of him. She found pleasure in the special self-consciousnessit gave her. When she crossed her legs, when she leaned on her arm against thewindow sill, when she brushed her hair off her forehead—every movement of herbody was underscored by a feeling the unadmitted words for which were: Is heseeing it?The towns had been left behind. The track was rising through a country growingmore grimly reluctant to permit approach. The rails kept vanishing behindcurves, and the ridges of hills kept moving closer, as if the plains were beingfolded into pleats. The flat stone shelves of Colorado were advancing to theedge of the track—and the distant reaches of the sky were shrinking into wavesof bluish mountains.Far ahead, they saw a mist of smoke over factory chimneys—then the web of apower station and the lone needle of a steel structure. They were approachingDenver.She glanced at Pat Logan. He was leaning forward a little farther. She saw aslight tightening in the fingers of his hand and in his eyes. He knew, as shedid, the danger of crossing the city at the speed they were traveling.It was a succession of minutes, but it hit them as a single whole. First, theysaw the lone shapes, which were factories, rolling across their windowpanes—thenthe shapes fused into the blur of streets—then a delta of rails spread outbefore them, like the mouth of a funnel sucking them into the Taggart station,with nothing to protect them but the small green beads of light scattered overthe ground—from the height of the cab, they saw boxcars on sidings streak pastas flat ribbons of roof tops—the black hole of the train-shed flew at theirfaces—they hurtled through an explosion of sound, the beating of wheels againstthe glass panes of a vault, and the screams of cheering from a mass that swayedlike a liquid in the darkness among steel columns—they flew toward a glowingarch and the green lights hanging in the open sky beyond, the green lights thatwere like the door-knobs of space, throwing door after door open before them.Then, vanishing behind them, went the streets clotted with traffic, the openwindows bulging with human figures, the screaming sirens, and—from the top of adistant skyscraper—a cloud of paper snowflakes shimmering on the air, flung bysomeone who saw the passage of a silver bullet across a city stopped still towatch it.Then they were out again, on a rocky grade—and with shocking suddenness, themountains were before them, as if the city had flung them straight at a granitewall, and a thin ledge had caught them in time. They were clinging to the sideof the vertical cliff, with the earth rolling down, dropping away, and gianttiers of twisted boulders streaming up and shutting out the sun, leaving them tospeed through a bluish twilight, with no sight of soil or sky.The curves of rail became coiling circles among walls that advanced to grindthem off their sides. But the track cut through at times and the mountainsparted, flaring open like two wings at the tip of the raH—one wing green, madeof vertical needles, with whole pines serving as the pile of a solid carpet—theother reddish-brown, made of naked rock.She looked down through the open window and saw the silver side of the enginehanging over empty space. Far below, the thin thread of a stream went fallingfrom ledge to ledge, and the ferns that drooped to the water were the shimmeringtops of birch trees. She saw the engine’s tail of boxcars winding along the faceof a granite drop—and miles of contorted stone below, she saw the coils ofgreen-blue rail unwinding behind the train.A wall of rock shot upward in their path, filling the windshield, darkening thecab, so close that it seemed as if the remnant of time could not let them escapeit. But she heard the screech of wheels on curve, the light came burstingback—and she saw an open stretch of rail on a narrow shelf. The shelf ended inspace. The nose of the engine was aimed straight at the sky. There was nothingto stop them but two strips of green-blue metal strung in a curve along theshelf.To take the pounding violence of sixteen motors, she thought, the thrust ofseven thousand tons of steel and freight, to withstand it, grip it and swing itaround a curve, was the impossible feat performed by two strips of metal nowider than her arm. What made it possible? What power had given to an unseenarrangement of molecules the power on which their lives depended and the livesof all the men who waited for the eighty boxcars? She saw a man’s face and handsin the glow of a laboratory oven, over the white liquid of a sample of metal.She felt the sweep of an emotion which she could not contain, as of somethingbursting upward. She turned to the door of the motor units, she threw it open toa screaming jet of sound and escaped into the pounding of the engine’s heart.For a moment, it was as if she were reduced to a single sense, the sense ofhearing, and what remained of her hearing was only a long rising, falling,rising scream. She stood in a swaying, sealed chamber of metal, looking at thegiant generators. She had wanted to see them, because the sense of triumphwithin her was bound to them, to her love for them, to the reason of thelife-work she had chosen. In the abnormal clarity of a violent emotion, she feltas if she were about to grasp something she had never known and had to know. Shelaughed aloud, but heard no sound of it; nothing could be heard through thecontinuous explosion. “The John Gait Line!” she shouted, for the amusement offeeling her voice swept away from her lips.She moved slowly along the length of the motor units, down a narrow passagebetween the engines and the wall. She felt the immodesty of an intruder, as ifshe had slipped inside a living creature, under its silver skin, and werewatching its life beating in gray metal cylinders, in twisted coils, in sealedtubes, in the convulsive whirl of blades in wire cages. The enormous complexityof the shape above her was drained by invisible channels, and the violenceraging within it was led to fragile needles on glass dials, to green and redbeads winking on panels, to tall, thin cabinets stenciled “High Voltage.”Why had she always felt that joyous sense of confidence when looking atmachines?—she thought. In these giant shapes, two aspects pertaining to theinhuman were radiantly absent: the causeless and the purposeless. Every part ofthe motors was an embodied answer to “Why?” and “What for?”—hke the steps of alife-course chosen by the sort of mind she worshipped. The motors were a moralcode cast in steel.They are alive, she thought, because they are the physical shape of the actionof a living power—of the mind that had been able to grasp the whole of thiscomplexity, to set its purpose, to give it form. For an instant, it seemed toher that the motors were transparent and she was seeing the net of their nervoussystem. It was a net of connections, more intricate, more crucial than all oftheir wires and circuits: the rational connections made by that human mind whichhad fashioned any one part of them for the first time.They are alive, she thought, but their soul operates them by remote control.Their soul is in every man who has the capacity to equal this achievement.Should the soul vanish from the earth, the motors would stop, because that isthe power which keeps them going—not the oil under the floor under her feet, theoil that would then become primeval ooze again—not the steel cylinders thatwould become stains of rust on the walls of the caves of shivering savages—thepower of a living mind—the power of thought and choice and purpose.She was making her way back toward the cab, feeling that she wanted to laugh, tokneel or to lift her arms, wishing she were able to release the thing she felt,knowing that it had no form of expression.She stopped. She saw Rearden standing by the steps of the door to the cab. Hewas looking at her as if he knew why she had escaped and what she felt. Theystood still, their bodies becoming a glance that met across a narrow passage.The beating within her was one with the beating of the motors—and she felt as ifboth came from him; the pounding rhythm wiped out her will. They went back tothe cab, silently, knowing that there had been a moment which was not to bementioned between them.The cliffs ahead were a bright, liquid gold. Strips of shadow were lengtheningin the valleys below. The sun was descending to the peaks in the west. They weregoing west and up, toward the sun.The sky had deepened to the greenish-blue of the rails, when they sawsmokestacks in a distant valley. It was one of Colorado’s new towns, the townsthat had grown like a radiation from the Wyatt oil fields. She saw the angularlines of modern houses, flat roofs, great sheets of windows. It was too far todistinguish people. In the moment when she thought that they would not bewatching the train at that distance, a rocket shot out from among the buildings,rose high above the town and broke as a fountain of gold stars against thedarkening sky. Men whom she could not see, were seeing the streak of the trainon the side of the mountain, and were sending a salute, a lonely plume of firein the dusk, the symbol of celebration or of a call for help.Beyond the next turn, in a sudden view of distance, she saw two dots of electriclight, white and red, low in the sky. They were not airplanes—she saw the conesof metal girders supporting them—and in the moment when she knew that they werethe derricks of Wyatt Oil, she saw that the track was sweeping downward, thatthe earth flared open, as if the mountains were flung apart—and at the bottom,at the foot of the Wyatt hill, across the dark crack of a canyon, she saw thebridge of Rearden Metal.They were flying down, she forgot the careful grading, the great curves of thegradual descent, she felt as if the train were plunging downward, head first,she watched the bridge growing to meet them—a small, square tunnel of metal lacework, a few beams criss-crossed through the air, green-blue and glowing, struckby a long ray of sunset light from some crack in the barrier of mountains. Therewere people by the bridge, the dark splash of a crowd, but they rolled off theedge of her consciousness. She heard the rising, accelerating sound of thewhee!s—and some theme of music, heard to the rhythm of wheels, kept tugging ather mind, growing louder—it burst suddenly within the cab, but she knew that itwas only in her mind: the Fifth Concerto by Richard Ha!!ey—she thought: did hewrite it for this? had he known a feeling such as this?—they were going faster,they had left the ground, she thought, flung off by the mountains as by aspringboard, they were now sailing through space—it’s not a fair test, shethought, we’re not going to touch that bridge—she saw Rearden’s face above her,she held his eyes and her head leaned back, so that her face lay still on theair under his face—they heard a ringing blast of metal, they heard a drum rollunder their feet, the diagonals of the bridge went smearing across the windowswith the sound of a metal rod being run along the pickets of a fence—then thewindows were too suddenly clear, the sweep of their downward plunge was carryingthem up a hill, the derricks of Wyatt Oil were reeling before them—Pat Loganturned, glancing up at Rearden with the hint of a smile—and Rearden said,“That’s that.”The sign on the edge of a roof read: Wyatt Junction. She stared, feeling thatthere was something odd about it, until she grasped what it was: the sign didnot move. The sharpest jolt of the journey was the realization that the enginestood still.She heard voices somewhere, she looked down and saw that there were people onthe platform. Then the door of the cab was flung open, she knew that she had tobe first to descend, and she stepped to the edge. For the flash of an instant,she felt the slenderness of her own body, the lightness of standing full-figurein a current of open air. She gripped the metal bars and started down theladder. She was halfway down when she felt the palms of a man’s hands slam tightagainst her ribs and waistline, she was torn off the steps, swung through theair and deposited on the ground. She could not believe that the young boylaughing in her face was Ellis Wyatt. The tense, scornful face she remembered,now had the purity, the eagerness, the joyous benevolence of a child in the kindof world for which he had been intended.She was leaning against his shoulder, feeling unsteady on the motionless ground,with his arm about her, she was laughing, she was listening to the things hesaid, she was answering, “But didn’t you know we would?”In a moment, she saw the faces around them. They were the bond-holders of theJohn Galt Line, the men who were Nielsen Motors, Hammond Cars, Stockton Foundryand all the others. She shook their hands, and there were no speeches; she stoodagainst Ellis Wyatt, sagging a little, brushing her hair away from her eyes,leaving smudges of soot on her forehead. She shook the hands of the men of thetrain’s crew, without words, with the seal of the grins on their faces. Therewere flash bulbs exploding around them, and men waving to them from the riggingsof the oil wells on the slopes of the mountains. Above her head, above the headsof the crowd, the letters TT on a silver shield were hit by the last ray of asinking sun.Ellis Wyatt had taken charge. He was leading her somewhere, the sweep of his armcutting a path for them through the crowd, when one of the men with the camerasbroke through to her side. “Miss Taggart,” he called, “will you give us amessage for the public?” Ellis Wyatt pointed at the long string of freight cars.“She has.”Then she was sitting in the back seat of an open car, driving up the curves of amountain road. The man beside her was Rearden, the driver was Ellis Wyatt.They stopped at a house that stood on the edge of a cliff, with no otherhabitation anywhere in sight, with the whole of the oil fields spread on theslopes below.“Why, of course you’re staying at my house overnight, both of you,” said EllisWyatt, as they went in. “Where did you expect to stay?”She laughed. “I don’t know. I hadn’t thought of it at all.”“The nearest town is an hour’s drive away. That’s where your crew has gone: yourboys at the division point are giving a party in their honor. So is the wholetown. But I told Ted Nielsen and the others that we’d have no banquets for youand no oratory. Unless you’d like it?”“God, no!” she said. “Thanks, Ellis.”It was dark when they sat at the dinner table in a room that had large windowsand a few pieces of costly furniture. The dinner was served by a silent figurein a white jacket, the only other inhabitant of the house, an elderly Indianwith a stony face and a courteous manner. A few points of fire were scatteredthrough the room, running over and out beyond the windows: the candles on thetable, the lights on the derricks, and the stars:“Do you think that you have your hands full now?” Ellis Wyatt was saying. “Justgive me a year and I’ll give you something to keep you busy. Two tank trains aday, Dagny? It’s going to be four or six or as many as you wish me to fill.” Hishand swept over the lights on the mountains. “This? It’s nothing, compared towhat I’ve got coming.” He pointed west. “The Buena Esperanza Pass. Five milesfrom here. Everybody’s wondering what I’m doing with it. Oil shale. How manyyears ago was it that they gave up trying to get oil from shale, because it wastoo expensive? Well, wait till you see the process I’ve developed. It will bethe cheapest oil ever to splash in their faces, and an unlimited supply of it,an untapped supply that will make the biggest oil pool look like a mud puddle.Did I order a pipe line? Hank, you and I will have to build pipe lines in alldirections to ... Oh, I beg your pardon. I don’t believe I introduced myselfwhen I spoke to you at the station. I haven’t even told you my name.”Rearden grinned. “I’ve guessed it by now.”“I’m sorry, I don’t like to be careless, but I was too excited.”“What were you excited about?” asked Dagny, her eyes narrowed in mockery.Wyatt held her glance for a moment; his answer had a tone of solemn intensitystrangely conveyed by a smiling voice. “About the most beautiful slap in theface I ever got and deserved.”“Do you mean, for our first meeting?”“I mean, for our first meeting.”“Don’t. You were right.”“I was. About everything but you. Dagny, to find an exception after years of ...Oh, to hell with them! Do you want me to turn on the radio and hear what they’resaying about the two of you tonight?”“No.”“Good. I don’t want to hear them. Let them swallow their own speeches. They’reall climbing on the band wagon now. We’re the band.” He glanced at Rearden.“What are you smiling at?”“I’ve always been curious to see what you’re like.”“I’ve never had a chance to be what I’m like—except tonight.”“Do you live here alone, like this, miles away from everything?”Wyatt pointed at the window. “I’m a couple of steps away from—everything.”“What about people?”“I have guest rooms for the kind of people who come to see me on business. Iwant as many miles as possible between myself and all the other kinds.” Heleaned forward to refill their wine glasses. “Hank, why don’t you move toColorado? To hell with New York and the Eastern Seaboard! This is the capital ofthe Renaissance. The Second Renaissance—not of oil paintings and cathedrals—butof oil derricks, power plants, and motors made of Rearden Metal. They had theStone Age and the Iron Age and now they’re going to call it the Rearden MetalAge—because there’s no limit to what your Metal has made possible.”“I’m going to buy a few square miles of Pennsylvania,” said Rearden. “The onesaround my mills. It would have been cheaper to build a branch here, as I wanted,but you know why I can’t, and to hell with them! I’ll beat them anyway. I’mgoing to expand the mills—and if she can give me three-day freight service toColorado, I’ll give you a race for who’s going to be the capital of theRenaissance!”“Give me a year,” said Dagny, “of running trains on the John Galt Line, give metime to pull the Taggart system together—and I’ll give you three-day freightservice across the continent, on a Rearden Metal track from ocean to ocean!”“Who was it that said he needed a fulcrum?” said Ellis Wyatt. “Give me anunobstructed right-of-way and I’ll show them how to move the earth!”She wondered what it was that she liked about the sound of Wyatt’s laughter.Their voices, even her own, had a tone she had never heard before. When theyrose from the table, she was astonished to notice that the candles were the onlyillumination of the room: she had felt as if she were sitting in a violentlight.Ellis Wyatt picked up his glass, looked at their faces and said, “To the worldas it seems to be right now!”He emptied the glass with a single movement.She heard the crash of the glass against the wall in the same instant that shesaw a circling current—from the curve of his body to the sweep of his arm to theterrible violence of his hand that flung the glass across the room. It was notthe conventional gesture meant as celebration, it was the gesture of arebellious anger, the vicious gesture which is movement substituted for a screamof pain.“Ellis,” she whispered, “what’s the matter?”He turned to look at her. With the same violent suddenness, his eyes were clear,his face was calm; what frightened her was seeing him smile gently. “I’m sorry,”he said. “Never mind. We’ll try to think that it will last.”The earth below was streaked with moonlight, when Wyatt led them up an outsidestairway to the second floor of the house, to the open gallery at the doors ofthe guest rooms. He wished them good night and they heard his steps descendingthe stairs. The moonlight seemed to drain sound as it drained color. The stepsrolled into a distant past, and when they died, the silence had the quality of asolitude that had lasted for a long time, as if no person were left anywhere inreach.She did not turn to the door of her room. He did not move. At the level of theirfeet, there was nothing but a thin railing and a spread of space. Angular tiersdescended below, with shadows repeating the steel tracery of derricks,criss-crossing sharp, black lines on patches of glowing rock. A few lights,white and red, trembled in the clear air, like drops of rain caught on the edgesof steel girders. Far in the distance, three small drops were green, strung in aline along the Taggart track. Beyond them, at the end of space, at the foot of awhite curve, hung a webbed rectangle which was the bridge.She felt a rhythm without sound or movement, a sense of beating tension, as ifthe wheels of the John Galt Line were still speeding on. Slowly, in answer andin resistance to an unspoken summons, she turned and looked at him.The look she saw on his face made her know for the first time that she had knownthis would be the end of the journey. That look was not as men are taught torepresent it, it was not a matter of loose muscles, hanging lips and mindlesshunger. The lines of his face were pulled tight, giving it a peculiar purity, asharp precision of form, making it clean and young. His mouth was taut, the lipsfaintly drawn inward, stressing the outline of its shape. Only his eyes wereblurred, their lower lids swollen and raised, their glance intent with thatwhich resembled hatred and pain.The shock became numbness spreading through her body—she felt a tight pressurein her throat and her stomach—she was conscious of nothing but a silentconvulsion that made her unable to breathe. But what she felt, without words forit, was: Yes, Hank, yes—now—because it is part of the same battle, in some waythat I can’t name ... because it is our being, against theirs ... our greatcapacity, for which they torture us, the capacity of happiness ... Now, likethis, without words or questions ... because we want it ...It was like an act of hatred, like the cutting blow of a lash encircling herbody: she felt his arms around her, she felt her legs pulled forward against himand her chest bent back under the pressure of his, his mouth on hers.Her hand moved from his shoulders to his waist to his legs, releasing theunconfessed desire of her every meeting with him. When she tore her mouth awayfrom him, she was laughing soundlessly, in triumph, as if saying: HankRearden—the austere, unapproachable Hank Rearden of the monklike office, thebusiness conferences, the harsh bargains—do you remember them now?—I’m thinkingof it, for the pleasure of knowing that I’ve brought you to this. He was notsmiling, his face was tight, it was the face of an enemy, he jerked her head andcaught her mouth again, as if he were inflicting a wound.She felt him trembling and she thought that this was the kind of cry she hadwanted to tear from him—this surrender through the shreds of his torturedresistance. Yet she knew, at the same time, that the triumph was his, that herlaughter was her tribute to him, that her defiance was submission, that thepurpose of all of her violent strength was only to make his victory thegreater—he was holding her body against his, as if stressing his wish to let herknow that she was now only a tool for the satisfaction of his desire—and hisvictory, she knew, was her wish to let him reduce her to that. Whatever I am,she thought, whatever pride of person I may hold, the pride of my courage, of mywork, of my mind and my freedom—that is what I offer you for the pleasure ofyour body, that is what I want you to use in your service—and that you want itto serve you is the greatest reward I can have.There were lights burning in the two rooms behind them. He took her wrist andthrew her inside his room, making the gesture tell her that he needed no sign ofconsent or resistance. He locked the door, watching her face. Standing straight,holding his glance, she extended her arm to the lamp on the table and turned outthe light. He approached. He turned the light on again, with a single,contemptuous jerk of his wrist. She saw him smile for the first time, a slow,mocking, sensual smile that stressed the purpose of his action.He was holding her half-stretched across the bed, he was tearing her clothesoff, while her face was pressed against him, her mouth moving down the line ofhis neck, down his shoulder. She knew that every gesture of her desire for himstruck him like a blow, that there was some shudder of incredulous anger withinhim—yet that no gesture would satisfy his greed for every evidence of herdesire.He stood looking down at her naked body, he leaned over, she heard his voice—itwas more a statement of contemptuous triumph than a question: “You want it?” Heranswer was more a gasp than a word, her eyes closed, her mouth open: “Yes.”She knew that what she felt with the skin of her arms was the cloth of hisshirt, she knew that the lips she felt on her mouth were his, but in the rest ofher there was no distinction between his being and her own, as there was nodivision between body and spirit. Through all the steps of the years behindthem, the steps down a course chosen in the courage of a single loyalty: theirlove of existence—chosen in the knowledge that nothing will be given, that onemust make one’s own desire and every shape of its fulfiltment—through the stepsof shaping metal, rails and motors—they had moved by the power of the thoughtthat one remakes the earth for one’s enjoyment, that man’s spirit gives meaningto insentient matter by molding it to serve one’s chosen goal. The course ledthem to the moment when, in answer to the highest of one’s values, in anadmiration not to be expressed by any other form of tribute, one’s spirit makesone’s body become the tribute, recasting it—as proof, as sanction, asreward—into a single sensation of such intensity of joy that no other sanctionof one’s existence is necessary. He heard the moan of her breath; she felt theshudder of his body, in the same instant. She looked at the glowing bands on the skin of her arm, spaced like braceletsfrom her wrist to her shoulder. They were strips of sunlight from the Venetianblinds on the window of an unfamiliar room. She saw a bruise above her elbow,with dark beads that had been blood. Her arm lay on the blanket that covered herbody. She was aware of her legs and hips, but the rest of her body was only asense of lightness, as if it were stretched restfully across the air in a placethat looked like a cage made of sunrays.Turning to look at him, she thought: From his aloofness, from his manner ofglass-enclosed formality, from his pride in never being made to feel anything—tothis, to Hank Rearden in bed beside her, after hours of a violence which theycould not name now, not in words or in daylight—but which was in their eyes, asthey looked at each other, which they wanted to name, to stress, to throw ateach other’s face.He saw the face of a young girl, her lips suggesting a smile, as if her naturalstate of relaxation were a state of radiance, a lock of hair falling across hercheek to the curve of a naked shoulder, her eyes looking at him as if she wereready to accept anything he might wish to say, as she had been ready to acceptanything he had wished to do.He reached over and moved the lock of hair from her cheek, cautiously, as if itwere fragile. He held it back with his fingertips and looked at her face. Thenhis fingers closed suddenly in her hair and he raised the lock to his lips. Theway he pressed his mouth to it was tenderness, but the way his fingers held itwas despair.He dropped back on the pillow and lay still, his eyes closed. His face seemedyoung, at peace. Seeing it for a moment without the reins of tension, sherealized suddenly the extent of the unhappiness he had borne; but it’s past now,she thought, it’s over.He got up, not looking at her. His face was blank and closed again. He picked uphis clothes from the floor and proceeded to dress, standing in the middle of theroom, half-turned away from her. He acted, not as if she wasn’t present, but asif it did not matter that she was. His movements, as he buttoned his shirt, ashe buckled the belt of his slacks, had the rapid precision of performing a duty.She lay back on the pillow, watching him, enjoying the sight of his figure inmotion. She liked the gray slacks and shirt—the expert mechanic of the John GaltLine, she thought, in the stripes of sunlight and shadow, like a convict behindbars. But they were not bars any longer, they were the cracks of a wall whichthe John Galt Line had broken, the advance notice of what awaited them outside,beyond the Venetian blinds—she thought of the trip back, on the new rail, withthe first train from Wyatt Junction—the trip back to her office in the TaggartBuilding and to all the things now open for her to win—but she was free to letit wait, she did not want to think of it, she was thinking of the first touch ofhis mouth on hers—she was free to feel it, to hold a moment when nothing elsewas of any concern—she smiled defiantly at the strips of sky beyond the blinds.“I want you to know this.”He stood by the bed, dressed, looking down at her. His voice had pronounced itevenly, with great clarity and no inflection. She looked up at him obediently.He said:“What I feel for you is contempt. But it’s nothing, compared to the contempt Ifeel for myself. I don’t love you. I’ve never loved anyone. I wanted you fromthe first moment I saw you. I wanted you as one wants a whore—for the samereason and purpose. I spent two years damning myself, because I thought you wereabove a desire of this kind. You’re not. You’re as vile an animal as I am. Ishould loathe my discovering it. I don’t. Yesterday, I would have killed anyonewho’d tell me that you were capable of doing what I’ve had you do. Today, Iwould give my life not to let it be otherwise, not to have you be anything butthe bitch you are. All the greatness that I saw in you—I would not take it inexchange for the obscenity of your talent at an animal’s sensation of pleasure.We were two great beings, you and I, proud of our strength, weren’t we? Well,this is all that’s left of us—and I want no self-deception about it.”He spoke slowly; as if lashing himself with his words. There was no sound ofemotion in his voice, only the lifeless pull of effort; it was not the tone of aman’s willingness to speak, but the ugly, tortured sound of duty.“I held it as my honor that I would never need anyone. I need you. It had beenmy pride that,I had always acted on my convictions. I’ve given in to a desirewhich I despise. It is a desire that has reduced my mind, my will, my being, mypower to exist into an abject dependence upon you—not even upon the DagnyTaggart whom I admired—but upon your body, your hands, your mouth and the fewseconds of a convulsion of your muscles. I had never broken my word. Now I’vebroken any oath I gave for life. I had never committed an act that had to behidden. Now I am to lie, to sneak, to hide. Whatever I wanted, I was free toproclaim it aloud and achieve it in the sight of the whole world. Now my onlydesire is one I loathe to name even to myself. But it is my only desire. I’mgoing to have you—I’d give up everything I own for it, the mills, the Metal, theachievement of my whole life. I’m going to have you at the price of more thanmyself: at the price of my self-esteem—and I want you to know it. I want nopretense, no evasion, no silent indulgence, with the nature of our actions leftunnamed. I want no pretense about love, value, loyalty or respect. I want noshred of honor left to us, to hide behind. I’ve never begged for mercy. I’vechosen to do this—and I’ll take all the consequences, including the fullrecognition of my choice. It’s depravity—and I accept it as such—and there is noheight of virtue that I wouldn’t give up for it. Now if you wish to slap myface, go ahead. I wish you would.”She had listened, sitting up straight, holding the blanket clutched at herthroat to cover her body. At first, he had seen her eyes growing dark withincredulous shock. Then it seemed to him that she was listening with greaterattentiveness, but seeing more than his face, even though her eyes were fixed onhis. She looked as if she were studying intently some revelation that had neverconfronted her before. He felt as if some ray of light were growing stronger onhis face, because he saw its reflection on hers, as she watched him—he saw theshock vanishing, then the wonder—he saw her face being smoothed into a strangeserenity that seemed quiet and glittering at once.When he stopped, she burst out laughing.The shock to him was that he heard no anger in her laughter. She laughed simply,easily, in joyous amusement, in release, not as one laughs at the solution of aproblem, but at the discovery that no problem had ever existed.She threw the blanket off with a stressed, deliberate sweep of her arm. Shestood up. She saw her clothes on the floor and kicked them aside. She stoodfacing him, naked. She said:“I want you, Hank. I’m much more of an animal than you think. I wanted you fromthe first moment I saw you—and the only thing I’m ashamed of is that I did notknow it. I did not know why, for two years, the brightest moments I found werethe ones in your office, where I could lift my head to look up at you. I did notknow the nature of what I felt in your presence, nor the reason. I know it now.That is all I want, Hank. I want you in my bed—and you are free of me for allthe rest of your time. There’s nothing you’ll have to pretend—don’t think of me,don’t feel, don’t care—I do not want your mind, your will, your being or yoursoul, so long as it’s to me that you will come for that lowest one of yourdesires. I am an animal who wants nothing but the sensation of pleasure whichyou despise—but I want it from you. You’d give up any height of virtue for it,while I—I haven’t any to give up. There’s none I seek or wish to reach. I am solow that I would exchange the greatest sight of beauty in the world for thesight of your figure in the cab of a railroad engine. And seeing it, I would notbe able to see it indifferently. You don’t have to fear that you’re notdependent upon me. It’s I who will depend on any whim of yours. You’ll have meany time you wish, anywhere, on any terms. Did you call it the obscenity of mytalent? It’s such that it gives you a safer hold on me than on any otherproperty you own. You may dispose of me as you please—I’m not afraid to admitit—I have nothing to protect from you and nothing to reserve. You think thatthis is a threat to your achievement, but it is not to mine. I will sit at mydesk, and work, and when the things around me get hard to bear, I will thinkthat for my reward I will be in your bed that night. Did you call it depravity?I am much more depraved than you are: you hold it as your guilt, and I—as mypride. I’m more proud of it than of anything I’ve done, more proud than ofbuilding the Line. If I’m asked to name my proudest attainment, I will say: Ihave slept with Hank Rearden. I had earned it.”When he threw her down on the bed, their bodies met like the two sounds thatbroke against each other in the air of the room: the sound of his tortured moanand of her laughter.022 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_022_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: Shortly after the successful run of the John Galt Line, Reardenand Dagny, while on vacation, happen across a revolutionary discovery—leftinside an abandoned factory in a blighted part of the country."},{"pageContent":"The Abandoned FactoryTHE EARTH went flowing under the hood of the car. Uncoiling from among thecurves of Wisconsin’s hills, the highway was the only evidence of human labor, aprecarious bridge stretched across a sea of brush, weeds and trees. The searolled softly, in sprays of yellow and orange, with a few red jets shooting upon the hillsides, with pools of remnant green in the hollows, under a pure bluesky. Among the colors of a picture post card, the car’s hood looked like thework of a jeweler, with the sun sparkling on its chromium steel, and its blackenamel reflecting the sky.Dagny leaned against the corner of the side window, her legs stretched forward;she liked the wide, comfortable space of the car’s seat and the warmth of thesun on her shoulders; she thought that the countryside was beautiful.“What I’d like to see,” said Rearden, “is a billboard.”She laughed: he had answered her silent thought. “Selling what and to whom? Wehaven’t seen a car or a house for an hour.”“That’s what I don’t like about it.” He bent forward a little, his hands on thewheel; he was frowning. “Look at that road.”The long strip of concrete was bleached to the powdery gray of bones left on adesert, as if sun and snows had eaten away the traces of tires, oil and carbon,the lustrous polish of motion. Green weeds rose from the angular cracks of theconcrete. No one had used the road or repaired it for many years; but the crackswere few.“It’s a good road,” said Rearden. “It was built to last. The man who built itmust have had a good reason for expecting it to carry a heavy traffic in theyears ahead.”“Yes...”“I don’t like the looks of this.”“I don’t either.” Then she smiled. “But think how often we’ve heard peoplecomplain that billboards ruin the appearance of the countryside. Well, there’sthe unruined countryside for them to admire.” She added, “They’re the people Ihate.”She did not want to feel the uneasiness which she felt like a thin crack underher enjoyment of this day. She had felt that uneasiness at times, in the lastthree weeks, at the sight of the country streaming past the wedge of the car’shood. She smiled: it was the hood that had been the immovable point in her fieldof vision, while the earth had gone by, it was the hood that had been thecenter, the focus, the security in a blurred, dissolving world ... the hoodbefore her and Rearden’s hands on the wheel by her side ... she smiled, thinkingthat she was satisfied to let this be the shape of her world.After the first week of their wandering, when they had driven at random, at themercy of unknown crossroads, he had said to her one morning as they started out,“Dagny, does resting have to be purposeless?” She had laughed, answering, “No.What factory do you want to see?” He had smiled—at the guilt he did not have toassume, at the explanations he did not have to give—and he had answered. “It’san abandoned ore mine around Saginaw Bay, that I’ve heard about. They say it’sexhausted.”They had driven across Michigan to the ore mine. They had walked through theledges of an empty pit, with the remnants of a crane like a skeleton bendingabove them against the sky, and someone’s rusted lunchbox clattering away fromunder their feet. She had felt a stab of uneasiness, sharper than sadness—butRearden had said cheerfully “Exhausted, hell! I’ll show them how many tons anddollars I can draw out of this place!” On their way back to the car, he hadsaid, “If I could find the right man, I’d buy that mine for him tomorrow morningand set him up to work it.”The next day, when they were driving west and south, toward the plains ofIllinois, he had said suddenly, after a long silence. “No, I’ll have to waittill they junk the Bill. The man who could work that mine, wouldn’t need me toteach him. The man who’d need me, wouldn’t be worth a damn.”They could speak of their work, as they always had, with full confidence inbeing understood. But they never spoke of each other. He acted as if theirpassionate intimacy were a nameless physical fact, not to be identified in thecommunication between two minds. Each night, it was as if she lay in the arms ofa stranger who let her see every shudder of sensation that ran through his body,but would never permit her to know whether the shocks reached any answeringtremor within him. She lay naked at his side, but on her wrist there was thebracelet of Rearden Metal.She knew that he hated the ordeal of signing the “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” on theregisters of squalid roadside hotels. There were evenings when she noticed thefaint contraction of anger in the tightness of his mouth, as he signed theexpected names of the expected fraud, anger at those who made fraud necessary.She noticed, indifferently, the air of knowing slyness in the manner of thehotel clerks, which seemed to suggest that guests and clerks alike wereaccomplices in a shameful guilt: the guilt of seeking pleasure. But she knewthat it did not matter to him when they were alone, when he held her against himfor a moment and she saw his eyes look alive and guiltless.They drove through small towns, through obscure side roads, through the kind ofplaces they had not seen for years. She felt uneasiness at the sight of thetowns. Days passed before she realized what it was that she missed most: aglimpse of fresh paint. The houses stood like men in unpressed suits, who hadlost the desire to stand straight: the cornices were like sagging shoulders, thecrooked porch steps like torn hem lines, the broken windows like patches, mendedwith clapboard. The people in the streets stared at the new car, not as onestares at a rare sight, but as if the glittering black shape were an impossiblevision from another world. There were few vehicles in the streets and too manyof them were horsedrawn. She had forgotten the literal shape and usage ofhorsepower; she did not like to see its return.She did not laugh, that day at the grade crossing, when Rearden chuckled,pointing, and she saw the train of a small local railroad come tottering frombehind a hill, drawn by an ancient locomotive that coughed black smoke through atall stack.“Oh God, Hank, it’s not funny!”“I know,” he said.They were seventy miles and an hour away from it, when she said, “Hank, do yousee the Taggart Comet being pulled across the continent by a coal-burner of thatkind?”“What’s the matter with you? Pull yourself together.”“I’m sorry ... It’s just that I keep thinking it won’t be any use, all my newtrack and all your new furnaces, if we don’t find someone able to produce Dieselengines. If we don’t find him fast.”“Ted Nielsen of Colorado is your man.”“Yes, if he finds a way to open his new plant. He’s sunk more money than heshould into the bonds of the John Gait Line.”“That’s turned out to be a pretty profitable investment, hasn’t it?”“Yes, but it’s held him up. Now he’s ready to go ahead, but he can’t find thetools. There are no machine tools to buy, not anywhere, not at any price. He’sgetting nothing but promises and delays. He’s combing the country, looking forold junk to reclaim from closed factories. If he doesn’t start soon—”“He will. Who’s going to stop him now?”“Hank,” she said suddenly, “could we go to a place I’d like to see?”“Sure. Anywhere. Which place?”“It’s in Wisconsin. There used to be a great motor company there, in my father’stime. We had a branch line serving it, but we closed the hne—about seven yearsago—when they closed the factory. I think it’s one of those blighted areas now.Maybe there’s still some machinery left there that Ted Nielsen could use. Itmight have been overlooked—the place is forgotten and there’s no transportationto it at all.”“I’ll find it. What was the name of the factory?”“The Twentieth Century Motor Company.”“Oh, of course! That was one of the best motor firms in my youth, perhaps thebest. I seem to remember that there was something odd about the way it went outof business ... can’t recall what it was.”It took them three days of inquiries, but they found the bleached, abandonedroad—and now they were driving through the yellow leaves that glittered like asea of gold coins, to the Twentieth Century Motor Company.“Hank, what if anything happens to Ted Nielsen?” she asked suddenly, as theydrove in silence.“Why should anything happen to him?”“I don’t know, but ... well, there was Dwight Sanders. He vanished. UnitedLocomotives is done for now. And the other plants are in no condition to produceDiesels. I’ve stopped listening to promises. And ... and of what use is arailroad without motive power?”“Of what use is anything, for that matter, without it?”The leaves sparkled, swaying in the wind. They spread for miles, from grass tobrush to trees, with the motion and all the colors of fire; they seemed tocelebrate an accomplished purpose, burning in unchecked, untouched abundance.Rearden smiled. “There’s something to be said for the wilderness. I’m beginningto like it. New country that nobody’s discovered.” She nodded gaily. “It’s goodsoil—look at the way things grow. I’d clear that brush and I’d build a—”And then they stopped smiling. The corpse they saw in the weeds by the roadsidewas a rusty cylinder with bits of glass—the remnant of a gas-station pump.It was the only thing left visible. The few charred posts, the slab of concreteand the sparkle of glass dust—which had been a gas station—were swallowed in thebrush, not to be noticed except by a careful glance, not to be seen at all inanother year.They looked away. They drove on, not wanting to know what else lay hidden underthe miles of weeds. They felt the same wonder like a weight in the silencebetween them: wonder as to how much the weeds had swallowed and how fast.The road ended abruptly behind the turn of a hill. What remained was a fewchunks of concrete sticking out of a long, pitted stretch of tar and mud. Theconcrete had been smashed by someone and carted away; even weeds could not growin the strip of earth left behind. On the crest of a distant hill, a singletelegraph pole stood slanted against the sky, like a cross over a vast grave.It took them three hours and a punctured tire to crawl in low gear throughtrackless soil, through gullies, then down ruts left by cart wheels—to reach thesettlement that lay in the valley beyond the hill with the telegraph pole.A few houses still stood within the skeleton of what had once been an industrialtown. Everything that could move, had moved away; but some human beings hadremained. The empty structures were vertical rubble; they had been eaten, not bytime, but by men: boards torn out at random, missing patches of roofs, holesleft in gutted cellars. It looked as if blind hands had seized whatever fittedthe need of the moment, with no concept of remaining in existence the nextmorning. The inhabited houses were scattered at random among the ruins; thesmoke of their chimneys was the only movement visible in town. A shell ofconcrete, which had been a schoolhouse, stood on the outskirts; it looked like askull, with the empty sockets of glassless windows, with a few strands of hairstill clinging to it, in the shape of broken wires.Beyond the town, on a distant hill, stood the factory of the Twentieth CenturyMotor Company. Its walls, roof lines and smokestacks looked trim, impregnablelike a fortress. It would have seemed intact but for a silver water tank: thewater tank was tipped sidewise.They saw no trace of a road to the factory in the tangled miles of trees andhillsides. They drove to the door of the first house in sight that showed afeeble signal of rising smoke. The door was open. An old woman came shufflingout at the sound of the motor. She was bent and swollen, barefooted, dressed ina garment of flour sacking. She looked at the car without astonishment, withoutcuriosity; it was the blank stare of a being who had lost the capacity to feelanything but exhaustion.“Can you tell me the way to the factory?” asked Rearden.The woman did not answer at once; she looked as if she would be unable to speakEnglish. “What factory?” she asked.Rearden pointed. “That one.”“It’s closed.”“I know it’s closed. But is there any way to get there?”“I don’t know.”“Is there any sort of road?”“There’s roads in the woods.”“Any for a car to drive through?”“Maybe.”“Well, which would be the best road to take?”“I don’t know.”Through the open door, they could see the interior of her house. There was auseless gas stove, its oven stuffed with rags, serving as a chest of drawers.There was a stove built of stones in a corner, with a few logs burning under anold kettle, and long streaks of soot rising up the wall. A white object laypropped against the legs of a table: it was a porcelain washbowl, torn from thewall of some bathroom, filled with wilted cabbages. A tallow candle stood in abottle on the table. There was no paint left on the floor; its boards werescrubbed to a soggy gray that looked like the visual expression of the pain inthe bones of the person who had bent and scrubbed and lost the battle againstthe grime now soaked into the grain of the boards.A brood of ragged children had gathered at the door behind the woman, silently,one by one. They stared at the car, not with the bright curiosity of children,but with the tension of savages ready to vanish at the first sign of danger.“How many miles is it to the factory?” asked Rearden.“Ten miles,” said the woman, and added, “Maybe five.”“How far is the next town?”“There ain’t anv next town.”“There are other towns somewhere. I mean, how far?”“Yeah. Somewhere.”In the vacant space by the side of the house, they saw faded rags hanging on aclothesline, which was a piece of telegraph wire. Three chickens pecked amongthe beds of a scraggly vegetable garden; a fourth sat roosting on a bar whichwas a length of plumber’s pipe. Two pigs waddled in a stretch of mud and refuse;the stepping stones laid across the muck were pieces of the highway’s concrete.They heard a screeching sound in the distance and saw a man drawing water from apublic well by means of a rope pulley. They watched him as he came slowly downthe street. He carried two buckets that seemed too heavy for his thin arms. Onecould not tell his age. He approached and stopped, looking at the car. His eyesdarted at the strangers, then away, suspicious and furtive.Rearden took out a ten-dollar bill and extended it to him, asking; “Would youplease tell us the way to the factory?”The man stared at the money with sullen indifference, not moving, not lifting ahand for it, still clutching the two buckets. If one were ever to see a mandevoid of greed, thought Dagny, there he was.“We don’t need no money around here,” he said.“Don’t you work for a living?”“Yeah.”“Well, what do you use for money?”The man put the buckets down, as if it had just occurred to him that he did nothave to stand straining under their weight. “We don’t use no money,” he said.“We just trade things amongst us.”“How do you trade with people from other towns?”“We don’t go to no other towns.”“You don’t seem to have it easy here.”“What’s that to you?”“Nothing. Just curiosity. Why do you people stay here?”“My old man use to have a grocery store here. Only the factory closed.”“Why didn’t you move?”“Where to?”“Anywhere.”“What for?”Dagny was staring at the two buckets: they were square tins with rope handles;they had been oil cans.“Listen,” said Rearden, “can you tell us whether there’s a road to the factory?”“There’s plenty of roads.”“Is there one that a car can take?”“I guess so.”“Which one?”The man weighed the problem earnestly for some moments. “Well, now if you turnto the left by the schoolhouse,” he said, “and go on till you come to thecrooked oak, there’s a road up there that’s fine when it don’t rain for a coupleof weeks.”“When did it rain last?”“Yesterday.”“Is there another road?”“Well, you could go through Hanson’s pasture and across the woods and thenthere’s a good, solid road there, all the way down to the creek.”“Is there a bridge across the creek?”“No.”“What are the other roads?”“Well, if it’s a car road that you want, there’s one the other side of Miller’spatch, it’s paved, it’s the best road for a car, you just turn to the right bythe schoolhouse and—”“But that road doesn’t go to the factory, does it?”“No, not to the factory.”“All right,” said Rearden. “Guess we’ll find our own way.”He had pressed the starter, when a rock came smashing into the windshield. Theglass was shatterproof, but a sunburst of cracks spread across it. They saw aragged little hoodlum vanishing behind a corner with a scream of laughter, andthey heard the shrill laughter of children answering him from behind somewindows or crevices.Rearden suppressed a swear word. The man looked vapidly across the street,frowning a little. The old woman looked on, without reaction. She had stoodthere silently, watching, without interest or purpose, like a chemical compoundon a photographic plate, absorbing visual shapes because they were there to beabsorbed, but unable ever to form any estimate of the objects of her vision.Dagny had been studying her for some minutes. The swollen shapelessness of thewoman’s body did not look like the product of age and neglect: it looked as ifshe was pregnant. This seemed impossible, but glancing closer Dagny saw that herdust-colored hair was not gray and that there were few wrinkles on her face; itwas only the vacant eyes, the stooped shoulders, the shuffling movements thatgave her the stamp of senility.Dagny leaned out and asked, “How old are you?”The woman looked at her, not in resentment, but merely as one looks at apointless question. “Thirty-seven,” she answered.They had driven five former blocks away, when Dagny spoke.“Hank,” she said in terror, “that woman is only two years older than I!”“Yes.”“God, how did they ever come to such a state?”He shrugged. “Who is John Galt?”The last thing they saw, as they left the town, was a billboard. A design wasstill visible on its peeling strips, imprinted in the dead gray that had oncebeen color. It advertised a washing machine.In a distant field, beyond the town, they saw the figure of a man moving slowly,contorted by the ugliness of a physical effort beyond the proper use of a humanbody: he was pushing a plow by hand.They reached the factory of the Twentieth Century Motor Company two miles andtwo hours later. They knew, as they climbed the hill, that their quest wasuseless. A rusted padlock hung on the door of the main entrance, but the hugewindows were shattered and the place was open to anyone, to the woodchucks, therabbits and the dried leaves that lay in drifts inside.The factory had been gutted long ago. The great pieces of machinery had beenmoved out by some civilized means—the neat holes of their bases still remainedin the concrete of the floor. The rest had gone to random looters. There wasnothing left, except refuse which the neediest tramp had found worthless, pilesof twisted, rusted scraps, of boards, plaster and glass splinters—and the steelstairways, built to last and lasting, rising in trim spirals to the roof.They stopped in the great hall where a ray of light fell diagonally from a gapin the ceiling, and the echoes of their steps rang around them, dying far awayin rows of empty rooms. A bird darted from among the steel rafters and went in ahissing streak of wings out into the sky.“We’d better look through it, just in case,” said Dagny. “You take the shops andI’ll take the annexes. Let’s do it as fast as possible.”“I don’t like to let you wander around alone. I don’t know how safe they are,any of those floors or stairways.”“Oh, nonsense! I can find my way around a factory—or in a wrecking crew. Let’sget it over with. I want to get out of here.”When she walked through the silent yards—where steel bridges still hungoverhead, tracing lines of geometrical perfection across the sky—her only wishwas not to see any of it, but she forced herself to look. It was like having toperform an autopsy on the body of one’s love. She moved her glance as anautomatic searchlight, her teeth clamped tight together. She walkedrapidly—there was no necessity to pause anywhere.It was in a room of what had been the laboratory that she stopped. It was a coilof wire that made her stop. The coil protruded from a pile of junk. She hadnever seen that particular arrangement of wires, yet it seemed familiar, as ifit touched the hint of some memory, faint and very distant. She reached for thecoil, but could not move it: it seemed to be part of some object buried in thepile.The room looked as if it had been an experimental laboratory—if she was right injudging the purpose of the torn remnants she saw on the walls: a great manyelectrical outlets, bits of heavy cable, lead conduits, glass tubing, built-incabinets without shelves or doors. There was a great deal of glass, rubber,plastic and metal in the junk pile, and dark gray splinters of slate that hadbeen a blackboard. Scraps of paper rustled dryly all over the floor. There werealso remnants of things which had not been brought here by the owner of thatroom: popcorn wrappers, a whiskey bottle, a confession magazine.She attempted to extricate the coil from the scrap pile. It would not move; itwas part of some large object. She knelt and began to dig through the junk.She had cut her hands, she was covered with dust by the time she stood up tolook at the object she had cleared. It was the broken remnant of the model of amotor. Most of its parts were missing, but enough was left to convey some ideaof its former shape and purpose.She had never seen a motor of this kind or anything resembling it. She could notunderstand the peculiar design of its parts or the functions they were intendedto perform.She examined the tarnished tubes and odd-shaped connections. She tried to guesstheir purpose, her mind going over every type of motor she knew and everypossible kind of work its parts could perform. None fitted the model. It lookedlike an electric motor, but she could not tell what fuel it was intended toburn. It was not designed for steam, or oil, or anything she could name.Her sudden gasp was not a sound, but a jolt that threw her at the junk pile. Shewas on her hands and knees, crawling over the wreckage, seizing every piece ofpaper in sight, flinging it away, searching further. Her hands were shaking.She found part of what she hoped had remained in existence. It was a thin sheafof typewritten pages clamped together—the remnant of a manuscript. Its beginningand end were gone; the bits of paper left under the clamp showed the thicknumber of pages it had once contained. The paper was yellowed and dry. Themanuscript had been a description of the motor.From the empty enclosure of the plant’s powerhouse, Rearden heard her voicescreaming, “Hank!” It sounded like a scream of terror.He ran in the direction of the voice. He found her standing in the middle of aroom, her hands bleeding, her stockings torn, her suit smeared with dust, abunch of papers clutched in her hand.“Hank, what does this look like?” she asked, pointing at an odd piece ofwreckage at her feet; her voice had the intense, obsessed tone of a personstunned by a shock, cut off from reality. “What does it look like?”“Are you hurt? What happened?”“No! ... Oh, never mind, don’t look at me! I’m all right. Look at this. Do youknow what that is?”“What did you do to yourself?”“I had to dig it out of there. I’m all right.”“You’re shaking.”“You will, too, in a moment. Hank! Look at it. Just look and tell me what youthink it is.”He glanced down, then looked attentively—then he was sitting on the floor,studying the object intently. “It’s a queer way to put a motor together,” hesaid, frowning.“Read this,” she said, extending the pages.He read, looked up and said, “Good God!”She was sitting on the floor beside him, and for a moment they could say nothingelse.“It was the coil,” she said. She felt as if her mind were racing, she could notkeep up with all the things which a sudden blast had opened to her vision, andher words came hurtling against one another. “It was the coil that I noticedfirst—because I had seen drawings like it, not quite, but something like it,years ago, when I was in school—it was in an old book, it was given up asimpossible long, long ago—but I liked to read everything I could find aboutrailroad motors. That book said that there was a time when men were thinking ofit—they worked on it, they spent years on experiments, but they couldn’t solveit and they gave it up. It was forgotten for generations. I didn’t think thatany living scientist ever thought of it now. But someone did. Someone has solvedit, now, today! ... Hank, do you understand? Those men, long ago, tried toinvent a motor that would draw static electricity from the atmosphere, convertit and create its own power as it went along. They couldn’t do it. They gave itup.” She pointed at the broken shape. “But there it is.”He nodded. He was not smiling. He sat looking at the remnant, intent on somethought of his own; it did not seem to be a happy thought.“Hank! Don’t you understand what this means? It’s the greatest revolution inpower motors since the internal-combustion engine—greater than that! It wipeseverything out—and makes everything possible. To hell with Dwight Sanders andall of them! Who’ll want to look at a Diesel? Who’ll want to worry about oil,coal or refueling stations? Do you see what I see? A brand-new locomotive halfthe size of a single Diesel unit, and with ten times the power. Aself-generator, working on a few drops of fuel, with no limits to its energy.The cleanest, swiftest, cheapest means of motion ever devised. Do you see whatthis will do to our transportation systems and to the country—in about oneyear?”There was no spark of excitement in his face. He said slowly, “Who designed it?Why was it left here?”“We’ll find out.”He weighed the pages in his hand reflectively. “Dagny,” he asked, “if you don’tfind the man who made it, will you be able to reconstruct that motor from whatis left?”She took a long moment, then the word fell with a sinking sound: “No.”“Nobody will. He had it all right. It worked—judging by what he writes here. Itis the greatest thing I’ve ever laid eyes on. It was. We can’t make it workagain. To supply what’s missing would take a mind as great as his.”“I’ll find him—if I have to drop every other thing I’m doing.”“—and if he’s still alive.”She heard the unstated guess in the tone of his voice. “Why do you say it likethat?”“I don’t think he is. If he were, would he leave an invention of this kind torot on a junk pile? Would he abandon an achievement of this size? If he werestill alive, you would have had the locomotives with the self-generators yearsago. And you wouldn’t have had to look for him, because the whole world wouldknow his name by now.”“I don’t think this model was made so very long ago.”He looked at the paper of the manuscript and at the rusty tarnish of the motor.“About ten years ago, I’d guess. Maybe a little longer.”“We’ve got to find him or somebody who knew him. This is more important—”“—than anything owned or manufactured by anyone today. I don’t think we’ll findhim. And if we don’t, nobody will be able to repeat his performance. Nobody willrebuild his motor. There’s not enough of it left. It’s only a lead, aninvaluable lead, but it would take the sort of mind that’s born once in acentury, to complete it. Do you see our present-day motor designers attemptingit?”“No.”“There’s not a first-rate designer left. There hasn’t been a new idea in motorsfor years. That’s one profession that seems to be dying—or dead.”“Hank, do you know what that motor would have meant, if built?”He chuckled briefly. “I’d say: about ten years added to the life of every personin this country—if you consider how many things it would have made easier andcheaper to produce, how many hours of human labor it would have released forother work, and how much more anyone’s work would have brought him. Locomotives?What about automobiles and ships and airplanes with a motor of this kind? Andtractors. And power plants. All hooked to an unlimited supply of energy, with nofuel to pay for, except a few pennies’ worth to keep the converter going. Thatmotor could have set the whole country in motion and on fire. It would havebrought an electric light bulb into every hole, even into the homes of thosepeople we saw down in the valley.”“It would have? It will. I’m going to find the man who made it.”“We’ll try.”He rose abruptly, but stopped to glance down at the broken remnant and said,with a chuckle that was not gay, “There was the motor for the John Galt Line.”Then he spoke in the brusque manner of an executive. “First, we’ll try to see ifwe can find their personnel office here. We’ll look for their records, ifthere’s any left. We want the names of their research staff and their engineers.I don’t know who owns this place now, and I suspect that the owners will be hardto find, or they wouldn’t have let it come to this. Then we’ll go over everyroom in the laboratory. Later, we’ll get a few engineers to fly here and combthe rest of the place.”They started out, but she stopped for a moment on the threshold. “Hank, thatmotor was the most valuable thing inside this factory,” she said, her voice low.“It was more valuable than the whole factory and everything it ever contained.Yet it was passed up and left in the refuse. It was the one thing nobody foundworth the trouble of taking.”“That’s what frightens me about this,” he answered.The personnel office did not take them long. They found it by the sign which wasleft on the door, but it was the only thing left. There was no furniture inside,no papers, nothing but the splinters of smashed windows.They went back to the room of the motor. Crawling on hands and knees, theyexamined every scrap of the junk that littered the floor. There was little tofind. They put aside the papers that seemed to contain laboratory notes, butnone referred to the motor, and there were no pages of the manuscript amongthem. The popcorn wrappers and the whiskey bottle testified to the kind ofinvading hordes that had rolled through the room, like waves washing theremnants of destruction away to unknown bottoms.They put aside a few bits of metal that could have belonged to the motor, butthese were too small to be of value. The motor looked as if parts of it had beenripped off, perhaps by someone who thought he could put them to some customaryuse. What had remained was too unfamiliar to interest anybody.On aching knees, her palms spread flat upon the gritty floor, she felt the angertrembling within her, the hurting, helpless anger that answers the sight ofdesecration. She wondered whether someone’s diapers hung on a clothesline madeof the motor’s missing wires—whether its wheels had become a rope pulley over acommunal well—whether its cylinder was now a pot containing geraniums on thewindow sill of the sweetheart of the man with the whiskey bottle.There was a remnant of light on the hill, but a blue haze was moving in upon thevalleys, and the red and gold of the leaves was spreading to the sky in stripsof sunset.It was dark when they finished. She rose and leaned against the empty frame ofthe window for a touch of cool air on her forehead. The sky was dark blue. “Itcould have set the whole country in motion and on fire.” She looked down at themotor. She looked out at the country. She moaned suddenly, hit by a single longshudder, and dropped her head on her arm, standing pressed to the frame of thewindow.“What’s the matter?” he asked.She did not answer.He looked out. Far below, in the valley, in the gathering night, there trembleda few pale smears which were the lights of tallow candles.023 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_023_r1.jpg]“God have mercy on us, ma’am!” said the clerk of the Hall of Records. “Nobodyknows who owns that factory now. I guess nobody will ever know it.”The clerk sat at a desk in a ground-floor office, where dust lay undisturbed onthe files and few visitors ever called. He looked at the shining automobileparked outside his window, in the muddy square that had once been the center ofa prosperous county seat; he looked with a faint, wistful wonder at his twounknown visitors.“Why?” asked Dagny.He pointed helplessly at the mass of papers he had taken out of the files. “Thecourt will have to decide who owns it, which I don’t think any court can do. Ifa court ever gets to it. I don’t think it will.”“Why? What happened?”“Well, it was sold out—the Twentieth Century, I mean. The Twentieth CenturyMotor Company. It was sold twice, at the same time and to two different sets ofowners. That was sort of a big scandal at the time, two years ago, and now it’sjust”—he pointed—“just a bunch of paper lying around, waiting for a courthearing. I don’t see how any judge will be able to untangle any property rightsout of it—or any right at all.”“Would you tell me please just what happened?”“Well, the last legal owner of the factory was The People’s Mortgage Company, ofRome, Wisconsin. That’s the town the other side of the factory, thirty milesnorth. That Mortgage Company was a sort of noisy outfit that did a lot ofadvertising about easy credit. Mark Yonts was the head of it. Nobody knew wherehe came from and nobody knows where he’s gone to now, but what they discovered,the morning after The People’s Mortgage Company collapsed, was that Mark Yontshad sold the Twentieth Century Motor factory to a bunch of suckers from SouthDakota, and that he’d also given it as collateral for a loan from a bank inIllinois. And when they took a look at the factory, they discovered that he’dmoved all the machinery out and sold it piece-meal, God only knows where and towhom. So it seems like everybody owns the place—and nobody. That’s how it standsnow—the South Dakotans and the bank and the attorney for the creditors of ThePeople’s Mortgage Company all suing one another, all claiming this factory, andnobody having the right to move a wheel in it, except that there’s no wheelsleft to move.”“Did Mark Yonts operate the factory before he sold it?”“Lord, no, ma’am! He wasn’t the kind that ever operates anything. He didn’t wantto make money, only to get it. Guess he got it, too—more than anyone could havemade out of that factory.”He wondered why the blond, hard-faced man, who sat with the woman in front ofhis desk, looked grimly out the window at their car, at a large object wrappedin canvas, roped tightly under the raised cover of the car’s luggagecompartment.“What happened to the factory records?”“Which do you mean, ma’am?”“Their production records. Their work records. Their ... personnel files.”“Oh, there’s nothing left of that now. There’s been a lot of looting going on.All the mixed owners grabbed what furniture or things they could haul out ofthere, even if the sheriff did put a padlock on the door. The papers and stufflike that—I guess it was all taken by the scavengers from Starnesville, that’sthe place down in the valley, where they’re having it pretty tough these days.They burned the stuff for kindling, most likely.”“Is there anyone left here who used to work in the factory?” asked Rearden.“No, sir. Not around here. They all lived down in Starnesville.”“All of them?” whispered Dagny; she was thinking of the ruins. “The ...engineers, too?”“Yes, ma’am. That was the factory town. They’ve all gone, long ago.”“Do you happen to remember the names of any men who worked there?”“No, ma’am.”“What owner was the last to operate the factory?” asked Rearden.“I couldn’t say, sir. There’s been so much trouble up there and the place haschanged hands so many times, since old Jed Starnes died. He’s the man who builtthe factory. He made this whole part of the country, I guess. He died twelveyears ago.”“Can you give us the names of all the owners since?”“No, sir. We had a fire in the old courthouse, about three years ago, and allthe old records are gone. I don’t know where you could trace them now.”“You don’t know how this Mark Yonts happened to acquire the factory?”“Yes, I know that. He bought it from Mayor Bascom of Rome. How Mayor Bascomhappened to own it, I don’t know.”“Where is Mayor Bascom now?”“Still there, in Rome.”“Thank you very much,” said Rearden, rising. “We’ll call on him.”They were at the door when the clerk asked, “What is it you’re looking for,sir?”“We’re looking for a friend of ours,” said Rearden. “A friend we’ve lost, whoused to work in that factory.”024 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_024_r1.jpg]Mayor Bascom of Rome, Wisconsin, leaned back in his chair; his chest and stomachformed a pear-shaped outline under his soiled shirt. The air was a mixture ofsun and dust, pressing heavily upon the porch of his house. He waved his arm,the ring on his finger flashing a large topaz of poor quality.“No use, no use, lady, absolutely no use,” he said. “Would be just a waste ofyour time, trying to question the folks around here. There’s no factory peopleleft, and nobody that would remember much about them. So many families havemoved away that what’s left here is plain no good, if I do say so myself, plainno good, just being Mayor of a bunch of trash.”He had offered chairs to his two visitors, but he did not mind it if the ladypreferred to stand at the porch railing. He leaned back, studying her long-linedfigure; high-class merchandise, he thought; but then, the man with her wasobviously rich.Dagny stood looking at the streets of Rome. There were houses, sidewalks,lampposts, even a sign advertising soft drinks; but they looked as if it werenow only a matter of inches and hours before the town would reach the stage ofStarnesville.“Naw; there’s no factory records left,” said Mayor Bascom. “If that’s what youwant to find, lady, give it up. It’s like chasing leaves in a storm now. Justlike leaves in a storm. Who cares about papers? At a time like this, what peoplesave is good, solid, material objects. One’s got to be practical.”Through the dusty windowpanes, they could see the living room of his house:there were Persian rugs on a buckled wooden floor, a portable bar with chomiumstrips against a wall stained by the seepage of last year’s rains, an expensiveradio with an old kerosene lamp placed on top of it.“Sure, it’s me that sold the factory to Mark Yonts. Mark was a nice fellow, anice, lively, energetic fellow. Sure, he did trim a few corners, but whodoesn’t? Of course, he went a bit too far. That, I didn’t expect. I thought hewas smart enough to stay within the law—whatever’s left of it nowadays.”Mayor Bascom smiled, looking at them in a manner of placid frankness. His eyeswere shrewd without intelligence, his smile good-natured without kindness.“I don’t think you folks are detectives,” he said, “but even if you were, itwouldn’t matter to me. I didn’t get any rake-off from Mark, he didn’t let me inon any of his deals, I haven’t any idea where he’s gone to now.” He sighed. “Iliked that fellow. Wish he’d stayed around. Never mind the Sunday sermons. Hehad to live, didn’t he? He was no worse than anybody, only smarter. Some getcaught at it and some don’t—that’s the only difference.... Nope, I didn’t knowwhat he was going to do with it, when he bought that factory. Sure, he paid mequite a bit more than the old booby trap was worth. Sure, he was doing me afavor when he bought it. Nope, I didn’t put any pressure on him to make him buyit. Wasn’t necessary. I’d done him a few favors before. There’s plenty of lawsthat’s sort of made of rubber, and a mayor’s in a position to stretch them a bitfor a friend. Well, what the hell? That’s the only way anybody ever gets rich inthis world”—he glanced at the luxurious black car—“as you ought to know.”“You were telling us about the factory,” said Rearden, trying to controlhimself.“What I can’t stand,” said Mayor Bascom, “is people who talk about principles.No principle ever filled anybody’s milk bottle. The only thing that counts inlife is solid, material assets. It’s no time for theories, when everything isfalling to pieces around us. Well, me—I don’t aim to go under. Let them keeptheir ideas and I’ll take the factory. I don’t want ideas, I just want my threesquare meals a day.”“Why did you buy that factory?”“Why does anybody buy any business? To squeeze whatever can be squeezed out ofit. I know a good chance when I see it. It was a bankruptcy sale and nobody muchwho’d want to bid on the old mess. So I got the place for peanuts. Didn’t haveto hold it long, either—Mark took it off my hands in two-three months. Sure, itwas a smart deal, if I say so myself. No big business tycoon could have done anybetter with it.”“Was the factory operating when you took it over?”“Naw It was shut down.”“Did you attempt to reopen it?”“Not me. I’m a practical person.”“Can you recall the names of any men who worked there?”“No. Never met ’em.”“Did you move anything out of the factory?”“Well, I’ll tell you. I took a look around—and what I liked was old Jed’s desk.Old Jed Starnes. He was a real big shot in his time. Wonderful desk, solidmahogany. So I carted it home. And some executive, don’t know who he was, had astall shower in his bathroom, the like of which I never saw. A glass door with amermaid cut in the glass, real art work, and hot stuff, too, hotter than any oilpainting. So I had that shower lifted and moved here. What the hell, I owned it,didn’t I? I was entitled to get something valuable out of that factory.”“Whose bankruptcy sale was it, when you bought the factory?”“Oh, that was the big crash of the Community National Bank in Madison. Boy, wasthat a crash! It just about finished the whole state of Wisconsin—sure finishedthis part of it. Some say it was this motor factory that broke the bank, butothers say it was only the last drop in a leaking bucket, because the CommunityNational had bum investments all over three or four states. Eugene Lawson wasthe head of it. The banker with a heart, they called him. He was quite famous inthese parts two-three years ago.”“Did Lawson operate the factory?”“No. He merely lent an awful lot of money on it, more than he could ever hope toget back out of the old dump. When the factory busted, that was the last strawfor Gene Lawson. The bank busted three months later.” He sighed. “It hit thefolks pretty hard around here. They all had their life savings in the CommunityNational.”Mayor Bascom looked regretfully past his porch railing at his town. He jerkedhis thumb at a figure across the street: it was a white-haired charwoman, movingpainfully on her knees, scrubbing the steps of a house.“See that woman, for instance? They used to be solid, respectable folks. Herhusband owned the dry-goods store. He worked all his life to provide for her inher old age, and he did, too, by the time he died—only the money was in theCommunity National Bank.”“Who operated the factory when it failed?”“Oh, that was some quicky corporation called Amalgamated Service, Inc. Just apuff-ball. Came up out of nothing and went back to it.”“Where are its members?”“Where are the pieces of a puff-ball when it bursts? Try and trace them all overthe United States. Try it.”“Where is Eugene Lawson?”“Oh, him? He’s done all right. He’s got a job in Washington—in the Bureau ofEconomic Planning and National Resources.”Rearden rose too fast, thrown to his feet by a jolt of anger, then said,controlling himself, “Thank you for the information.”“You’re welcome, friend, you’re welcome,” said Mayor Bascom placidly. “I don’tknow what it is you’re after, but take my word for it, give it up. There’snothing more to be had out of that factory.”“I told you that we are looking for a friend of ours.”“Well, have it your way. Must be a pretty good friend, if you’ll go to so muchtrouble to find him, you and the charming lady who is not your wife.”Dagny saw Rearden’s face go white, so that even his lips became a sculpturedfeature, indistinguishable against his skin. “Keep your dirty—” he began, butshe stepped between them.“Why do you think that I am not his wife?” she asked calmly.Mayor Bascom looked astonished by Rearden’s reaction; he had made the remarkwithout malice, merely like a fellow cheat displaying his shrewdness to hispartners in guilt.“Lady, I’ve seen a lot in my lifetime,” he said good-naturedly. “Married peopledon’t look as if they have a bedroom on their minds when they look at eachother. In this world, either you’re virtuous or you enjoy yourself. Not both,lady, not both.”“I’ve asked him a question,” she said to Rearden in time to silence him. “He’sgiven me an instructive explanation.”“If you want a tip, lady,” said Mayor Bascom, “get yourself a wedding ring fromthe dime store and wear it. It’s not sure fire, but it helps.”“Thank you,” she said. “Good-bye.”The stern, stressed calm of her manner was a command that made Rearden followher back to their car in silence.They were miles beyond the town when he said, not looking at her, his voicedesperate and low, “Dagny, Dagny, Dagny ... I’m sorry!”“I’m not.”Moments later, when she saw the look of control returning to his face, she said,“Don’t ever get angry at a man for stating the truth.”“That particular truth was none of his business.”“His particular estimate of it was none of your concern or mine.”He said through his teeth not as an answer, but as if the single thoughtbattering his brain turned into sounds against his will, “I couldn’t protect youfrom that unspeakable httle—”“I didn’t need protection.”He remained silent, not looking at her.“Hank, when you’re able to keep down the anger, tomorrow or next week, give somethought to that man’s explanation and see if you recognize any part of it.”He jerked his head to glance at her, but said nothing.When he spoke, a long time later, it was only to say in a tired, even voice, “Wecan’t call New York and have our engineers come here to search the factory. Wecan’t meet them here. We can’t let it be known that we found the motortogether.... I had forgotten all that ... up there ... in the laboratory.”“Let me call Eddie, when we find a telephone. I’ll have him send two engineersfrom the Taggart staff. I’m here alone, on my vacation, for all they’ll know orhave to know.”They drove two hundred miles before they found a long-distance telephone line.When she called Eddie Willers, he gasped, hearing her voice.“Dagny! For God’s sake, where are you?”“In Wisconsin. Why?”“I didn’t know where to reach you. You’d better come back at once. As fast asyou can.”“What happened?”“Nothing—yet. But there are things going on, which ... You’d better stop themnow, if you can. If anybody can.”“What things?”“Haven’t you been reading the newspapers?”“No.”“I can’t tell you over the phone. I can’t give you all the details. Dagny,you’ll think I’m insane, but I think they’re planning to kill Colorado.”“I’ll come back at once,” she said.025 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_025_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: This scene, from the middle of the novel, is a meeting ofWashingfon bureaucrats and businessmen who survive on government favors. Theparticipants have come together, in the midst of a national economic crisis, toformulate what they describe as “socially necessary” legislation.Wesley Mouch is chief regulator of the economy as a whole. Eugene Lawson worksunder him. Clem Weatherby is the bureaucrat in charge of the railroads. FloydFerris runs the State Science Institute. James Taggart is president of TaggartTranscontinental Railroad, and Orren Boyle-Hank Rearden’s chief competitor—ispresident of Associated Steel."},{"pageContent":"Directive 10-289“BUT CAN we get away with it?” asked Wesley Mouch. His voice was high with angerand thin with fear.Nobody answered him. James Taggart sat on the edge of an armchair not moving,looking up at him from under his forehead. Orren Boyle gave a vicious tapagainst an ashtray, shaking the ash off his cigar. Dr. Floyd Ferris smiled. Mr.Weatherby folded his lips and hands. Fred Kinnan, head of the Amalgamated Laborof America, stopped pacing the office, sat down on the window sill and crossedhis arms. Eugene Lawson, who had sat hunched downward, absentmindedlyrearranging a display of flowers on a low glass table, raised his torsoresentfully and glanced up. Mouch sat at his desk, with his fist on a sheet ofpaper.It was Eugene Lawson who answered. “That’s not, it seems to me, the way to putit. We must not let vulgar difficulties obstruct our feeling that it’s a nobleplan motivated solely by the public welfare. It’s for the good of the people.The people need it. Need comes first, so we don’t have to consider anythingelse.”Nobody objected or picked it up; they looked as if Lawson had merely made itharder to continue the discussion. But a small man who sat unobtrusively in thebest armchair of the room, apart from the others, content to be ignored andfully aware that none of them could be unconscious of his presence, glanced atLawson, then at Mouch, and said with brisk cheerfulness, “That’s the line,Wesley. Tone it down and dress it up and get your press boys to chant it—and youwon’t have to worry.”“Yes, Mr. Thompson,” said Mouch glumly.Mr. Thompson, the Head of the State, was a man who possessed the quality ofnever being noticed. In any group of three, his person became indistinguishable,and when seen alone it seemed to evoke a group of its own, composed of thecountless persons he resembled. The country had no clear image of what he lookedlike: his photographs had appeared on the covers of magazines as frequently asthose of his predecessors in office, but people could never be quite certainwhich photographs were his and which were pictures of “a mail clerk” or “awhite-collar worker,” accompanying articles about the daily life of theundifferentiated—except that Mr. Thompson’s collars were usually wilted. He hadbroad shoulders and a slight body. He had stringy hair, a wide mouth and anelastic age range that made him look like a harassed forty or an unusuallyvigorous sixty. Holding enormous official powers, he schemed ceaselessly toexpand them, because it was expected of him by those who had pushed him intooffice. He had the cunning of the unintelligent and the frantic energy of thelazy. The sole secret of his rise in life was the fact that he was a product ofchance and knew it and aspired to nothing else.“It’s obvious that measures have to be taken. Drastic measures,” said JamesTaggart, speaking, not to Mr. Thompson, but to Wesley Mouch. “We can’t letthings go the way they’re going much longer.” His voice was belligerent andshaky.“Take it easy, Jim,” said Orren Boyle.“Something’s got to be done and done fast!”“Don’t look at me,” snapped Wesley Mouch. “I can’t help it. I can’t help it ifpeople refuse to co-operate. I’m tied. I need wider powers.”Mouch had summoned them all to Washington, as his friends and personal advisers,for a private, unofficial conference on the national crisis. But, watching him,they were unable to decide whether his manner was overbearing or whining,whether he was threatening them or pleading for their help.“Fact is,” said Mr. Weatherby primly, in a statistical tone of voice, “that inthe twelve-month period ending on the first of this year, the rate of businessfailures has doubled, as compared with the preceding twelve-month period. Sincethe first of this year, it has trebled.”“Be sure they think it’s their own fault,” said Dr. Ferris casually.“Huh?” said Wesley Mouch, his eyes darting to Ferris.“Whatever you do, don’t apologize,” said Dr. Ferris. “Make them feel guilty.”“I’m not apologizing!” snapped Mouch. “I’m not to blame. I need wider powers.”“But it is their own fault,” said Eugene Lawson, turning aggressively to Dr.Ferris. “It’s their lack of social spirit. They refuse to recognize thatproduction is not a private choice, but a public duty. They have no right tofail, no matter what conditions happen to come up. They’ve got to go onproducing. It’s a social imperative. A man’s work is not a personal matter, it’sa social matter. There’s no such thing as a personal matter—or a personal life.That’s what we’ve got to force them to learn.”“Gene Lawson knows what I’m talking about,” said Dr. Ferris, with a slightsmile, “even though he hasn’t the faintest idea that he does.”“What do you think you mean?” asked Lawson, his voice rising.“Skip it,” ordered Wesley Mouch.“I don’t care what you decide to do, Wesley,” said Mr. Thompson, “and I don’tcare if the businessmen squawk about it. Just be sure you’ve got the press withyou. Be damn sure about that.”“I’ve got ’em,” said Mouch.“One editor who’d open his trap at the wrong time could do us more harm than tendisgruntled millionaires.”“That’s true, Mr. Thompson,” said Dr. Ferris. “But can you name one editor whoknows it?”“Guess not,” said Thompson; he sounded pleased.“Whatever type of men we’re counting on and planning for,” said Dr. Ferris,“there’s a certain old-fashioned quotation which we may safely forget: the oneabout counting on the wise and the honest. We don’t have to consider them.They’re out of date.”James Taggart glanced at the window. There were patches of blue in the sky abovethe spacious streets of Washington, the faint blue of mid-April, and a few beamsbreaking through the clouds. A monument stood shining in the distance, hit by aray of sun: it was a tall, white obelisk, erected to the memory of the man Dr.Ferris was quoting, the man in whose honor this city had been named. JamesTaggart looked away.“I don’t like the professor’s remarks,” said Lawson loudly and sullenly.“Keep still,” said Wesley Mouch. “Dr. Ferris is not talking theory, butpractice.”“Well, if you want to talk practice,” said Fred Kinnan, “then let me tell youthat we can’t worry about businessmen at a time like this. What we’ve got tothink about is jobs. More jobs for the people. In my unions, every man who’sworking is feeding five who aren’t, not counting his own pack of starvingrelatives. If you want my advice—oh, I know you won’t go for it, but it’s just athought—issue a directive making it compulsory to add, say, one-third more mento every payroll in the country.”“Good God!” yelled Taggart. “Are you crazy? We can barely meet our payrolls asit is! There’s not enough work for the men we’ve got now! One-third more? Wewouldn’t have any use for them whatever!”“Who cares whether you’d have any use for them?” said Fred Kinnan. “They needjobs. That’s what comes first—need—doesn’t It?—not your profits.”“It’s not a question of profits!” yelled Taggart hastily. “I haven’t saidanything about profits. I haven’t given you any grounds to insult me. It’s justa question of where in hell we’d get the money to pay your men—when half ourtrains are running empty and there’s not enough freight to fill a trolley car.”His voice slowed down suddenly to a tone of cautious thoughtfulness: “However,we do understand the plight of the working men, and—it’s just a thought—wecould, perhaps, take on a certain extra number, if we were permitted to doubleour freight rates, which—”“Have you lost your mind?” yelled Orren Boyle. “I’m going broke on the ratesyou’re charging now, I shudder every time a damn boxcar pulls in or out of themills, they’re bleeding me to death, I can’t afford it—and you want to doubleit?”“It is not essential whether you can afford it or not,” said Taggart coldly.“You have to be prepared to make some sacrifices. The public needs railroads.Need comes first—above your profits.”“What profits?” yelled Orren Boyle. “When did I ever make any profits? Nobodycan accuse me of running a profit-making business! Just look at my balancesheet—and then look at the books of a certain competitor of mine, who’s got allthe customers, all the raw materials, all the technical advantages and amonopoly on secret formulas—then tell me who’s the profiteer! ... But, ofcourse, the public does need railroads, and perhaps I could manage to absorb acertain raise in rates, if were to get—it’s just a thought—if I were to get asubsidy to carry me over the next year or two, until I catch my stride and—”“What? Again?” yelled Mr. Weatherby, losing his primness. “How many loans haveyou got from us and how many extensions, suspensions and moratoriums? Youhaven’t repaid a penny—and with all of you boys going broke and the tax receiptscrashing, where do you expect us to get the money to hand you a subsidy?”“There are people who aren’t broke,” said Boyle slowly. “You boys have no excusefor permitting all that need and misery to spread through the country—so long asthere are people who aren’t broke.”“I can’t help it!” yelled Wesley Mouch. “I can’t do anything about it! I needwider powers!”They could not tell what had prompted Mr. Thompson to attend this particularconference. He had said little, but had listened with interest. It seemed as ifthere was something which he had wanted to learn, and now he looked as if he hadlearned it. He stood up and smiled cheerfully.“Go ahead, Wesley,” he said. “Go ahead with Number 10-289. You won’t have anytrouble at all.”They had all risen to their feet, in gloomily reluctant deference. Wesley Mouchglanced down at his sheet of paper, then said in a petulant tone of voice. “Ifyou want me to go ahead, you’ll have to declare a state of total emergency.”“I’ll declare it any time you’re ready.”“There are certain difficulties, which—”“I’ll leave it to you. Work it out any way you wish. It’s your job. Let me seethe rough draft, tomorrow or next day, but don’t bother me about the details.I’ve got a speech to make on the radio in half an hour.”“The chief difficulty is that I’m not sure whether the law actually grants usthe power to put into effect certain provisions of Directive Number 10-289. Ifear they might be open to challenge.”“Oh, hell, we’ve passed so many emergency laws that if you hunt through them,you’re sure to dig up something that will cover it.”Mr. Thompson turned to the others with a smile of good fellowship. “I’ll leaveyou boys to iron out the wrinkles,” he said. “I appreciate your coming toWashington to help us out. Glad to have seen you.”They waited until the door closed after him, then resumed their seats; they didnot look at one another.They had not heard the text of Directive No. 10-289, but they knew what it wouldcontain. They had known it for a long time, in that special manner whichconsisted of keeping secrets from oneself and leaving knowledge translated intowords. And, by the same method, they now wished it were possible for them not tohear the words of the directive. It was to avoid moments such as this that allthe complex twistings of their minds had been devised.They wished the directive to go into effect. They wished it could be put intoeffect without words, so that they would not have to know that what they weredoing was what it was. Nobody had ever announced that Directive No. 10-289 wasthe final goal of his efforts. Yet, for generations past, men had worked to makeit possible, and for months past, every provision of it had been prepared for bycountless speeches, articles, sermons, editorials—by purposeful voices thatscreamed with anger if anyone named their purpose.“The picture now is this,” said Wesley Mouch. “The economic condition of thecountry was better than the year before last than it was last year, and lastyear it was better than it is at present. It’s obvious that we would not be ableto survive another year of the same progression. Therefore, our sole objectivemust now be to hold the line. To stand still in order to catch our stride. Toachieve total stability. Freedom has been given a chance and has failed.Therefore, more stringent controls are necessary. Since men are unable andunwilling to solve their problems voluntarily, they must be forced to do it.” Hepaused, picked up the sheet of paper, then added in a less formal tone of voice,“Hell, what it comes down to is that we can manage to exist as and where we are,but we can’t afford to move! So we’ve got to stand still. We’ve got to standstill. We’ve got to make those bastards stand still!”His head drawn into his shoulders, he was looking at them with the anger of aman declaring that the country’s troubles were a personal affront to him. Somany men seeking favors had been afraid of him that he now acted as if his angerwere a solution to everything, as if his anger were omnipotent, as if all he hadto do was to get angry. Yet, facing him, the men who sat in a silent semicirclebefore his desk were uncertain whether the presence of fear in the room wastheir own emotion or whether the hunched figure behind the desk generated thepanic of a cornered rat.Wesley Mouch had a long, square face and a flat-topped skull, made more so by abrush haircut. His lower lip was a petulant bulb and the pale, brownish pupilsof his eyes looked like the yolks of eggs smeared under the not fullytranslucent whites. His facial muscles moved abruptly, and the movementvanished, having conveyed no expression. No one had ever seen him smile.Wesley Mouch came from a family that had known neither poverty nor wealth nordistinction for many generations; it had clung, however, to a tradition of itsown: that of being college-bred and, therefore, of despising men who were inbusiness. The family’s diplomas had always hung on the wall in the manner of areproach to the world, because the diplomas had not automatically produced thematerial equivalents of their attested spiritual value. Among the family’snumerous relatives, there was one rich uncle. He had married his money and, inhis widowed old age, he had picked Wesley as his favorite from among his manynephews and nieces, because Wesley was the least distinguished of the lot andtherefore, thought Uncle Julius, the safest. Uncle Julius did not care forpeople who were brilliant. He did not care for the trouble of managing hismoney, either; so he turned the job over to Wesley. By the time Wesley graduatedfrom college, there was no money to manage. Uncle Julius blamed it on Wesley’scunning and cried that Wesley was an unscrupulous schemer. But there had been noscheme about it; Wesley could not have said just where the money had gone. Inhigh school, Wesley Mouch had been one of the worst students and hadpassionately envied those who were the best. College taught him that he did nothave to envy them at all. After graduation, he took a job in the advertisingdepartment of a company that manufactured a bogus corn-cure. The cure sold welland he rose to be the head of his department. He left it to take charge of theadvertising of a hair-restorer, then of a patented brassière, then of a newsoap, then of a soft drink—and then he became advertising vice-president of anautomobile concern. He tried to sell automobiles as if they were a boguscorn-cure. They did not sell. He blamed it on the insufficiency of hisadvertising budget. It was the president of the automobile concern whorecommended him to Rearden. It was Rearden who introduced him toWashington—Rearden, who knew no standard by which to judge the activities of hisWashington man. It was James Taggart who gave him a start in the Bureau ofEconomic Planning and National Resources—in exchange for double-crossing Reardenin order to help Orren Boyle in exchange for destroying Dan Conway. From thenon, people helped Wesley Mouch to advance, for the same reason as that which hadprompted Uncle Julius: they were people who believed that mediocrity was safe.The men who now sat in front of his desk had been taught that the law ofcausality was a superstition and that one had to deal with the situation of themoment without considering its cause. By the situation of the moment, they hadconcluded that Wesley Mouch was a man of superlative skill and cunning, sincemillions aspired to power, but he was the one who had achieved it. It was notwithin their method of thinking to know that Wesley Mouch was the zero at themeeting point of forces unleashed in destruction against one another.“This is just a rough draft of Directive Number 10-289,” said Wesley Mouch,“which Gene, Clem and I have dashed off just to give you the general idea. Wewant to hear your opinions, suggestions and so forth—you being therepresentatives of labor, industry, transportation and the professions.”Fred Kinnan got off the window sill and sat down on the arm of a chair. OrrenBoyle spit out the butt of his cigar. James Taggart looked down at his ownhands. Dr. Ferris was the only one who seemed to be at ease.“In the name of the general welfare,” read Wesley Mouch, “to protect thepeople’s security, to achieve full equality and total stability, it is decreedfor the duration of the national emergency that—“Point One.

All wages, prices, salaries, dividends, profits, interest ratesand forms of income of any nature whatsoever, shall be frozen at their presentfigures, as of the date of this directive.“Point Eight. All cases arising from and rules not specifically provided for inthis directive, shall be settled and determined by the Unification Board, whosedecisions will be final.”There was, even within the four men who had listened, a remnant of humandignity, which made them sit still and feel sick for the length of one minute.James Taggart spoke first. His voice was low, but it had the trembling intensityof an involuntary scream: “Well, why not? Why should they have it, if we don’t?Why should they stand above us? If we are to perish, let’s make sure that we allperish together. Let’s make sure that we leave them no chance to survive!”“That’s a damn funny thing to say about a very practical plan that will benefiteverybody,” said Orren Boyle shrilly, looking at Taggart in frightenedastonishment.Dr. Ferris chuckled.Taggart’s eyes seemed to focus, and he said, his voice louder, “Yes, of course.It’s a very practical plan. It’s necessary, practical and just. It will solveeverybody’s problems. It will give everybody a chance to feel safe. A chance torest.”“It will give security to the people,” said Eugene Lawson, his mouth slitheringinto a smile. “Security—that’s what the people want. If they want it, whyshouldn’t they have it? Just because a handful of rich will object?”“It’s not the rich who’ll object,” said Dr. Ferris lazily. “The rich drool forsecurity more than any other sort of animal—haven’t you discovered that yet?”“Well, who’ll object?” snapped Lawson.Dr. Ferris smiled pointedly, and did not answer.Lawson looked away. “To hell with them! Why should we worry about them? We’vegot to run the world for the sake of the little people. It’s intelligence that’scaused all the troubles of humanity. Man’s mind is the root of all evil. This isthe day of the heart. It’s the weak, the meek, the sick and the humble that mustbe the only objects of our concern.” His lower lip was twisting in soft,lecherous motions. “Those who’re big are here to serve those who aren’t. If theyrefuse to do their moral duty, we’ve got to force them. There once was an Age ofReason, but we’ve progressed beyond it. This is the Age of Love.”“Shut up!” screamed James Taggart.They all stared at him. “For Christ’s sake, Jim, what’s the matter?” said OrrenBoyle, shaking.“Nothing,” said Taggart, “nothing ... Wesley, keep him still, will you?”Mouch said uncomfortably, “But I fail to see—”“Just keep him still. We don’t have to listen to him, do we?”“Why, no, but—”“Then let’s go on.”“What is this?” demanded Lawson. “I resent it. I most emphatically—” But he sawno support in the faces around him and stopped, his mouth sagging into anexpression of pouting hatred.“Let’s go on,” said Taggart feverishly.“What’s the matter with you?” asked Orren Boyle, trying not to know what was thematter with himself and why he felt frightened.“Genius is a superstition, Jim,” said Dr. Ferris slowly, with an odd kind ofemphasis, as if knowing that he was naming the unnamed in all their minds.“There’s no such thing as the intellect. A man’s brain is a social product. Asum of influences that he’s picked up from those around him. Nobody inventsanything, he merely reflects what’s floating in the social atmosphere. A geniusis an intellectual scavenger and a greedy hoarder of the ideas which rightfullybelong to society, from which he stole them. All thought is theft. If we do awaywith private fortunes, we’ll have a fairer distribution of wealth. If we do awaywith genius, we’ll have a fairer distribution of ideas.”“Are we here to talk business or are we here to kid one another?” asked FredKinnan.They turned to him. He was a muscular man with large features, but his face hadthe astonishing property of finely drawn lines that raised the corners of hismouth into the permanent hint of a wise, sardonic grin. He sat on the arm of thechair, hands in pockets, looking at Mouch with the smiling glance of a hardenedpoliceman at a shoplifter.“All I’ve got to say is that you’d better staff that Unification Board with mymen,” he said. “Better make sure of it, brother—or I’ll blast your Point One tohell.”“I intend, of course, to have a representative of labor on that Board,” saidMouch dryly, “as well as a representative of industry, of the professions and ofevery cross-section of—”“No cross-sections,” said Fred Kinnan evenly. “Just representatives of labor.Period.”“What the hell!” yelled Orren Boyle. “That’s stacking the cards, isn’t it?”“Sure,” said Fred Kinnan.“But that will give you a stranglehold on every business in the country!”“What do you think I’m after?”“That’s unfair!” yelled Boyle. “I won’t stand for it! You have no right! You—”“Right?” said Kinnan innocently. “Are we talking about rights?”“But, I mean, after all, there are certain fundamental property rights which—”“Listen, pal, you want Point Three, don’t you?”“Well, I—”“Then you’d better keep your trap shut about property rights from now on. Keepit shut tight.”“Mr. Kinnan,” said Dr. Ferris, “you must not make the old-fashioned mistake ofdrawing wide generalizations. Our policy has to be flexible. There are noabsolute principles which—”“Save it for Jim Taggart, Doc,” said Fred Kinnan. “I know what I’m talkingabout. That’s because I never went to college.”“I object,” said Boyle, “to your dictatorial method of—”Kinnan turned his back on him and said, “Listen, Wesley, my boys won’t likePoint One. If I get to run things. I’ll make them swallow it. If not, not. Justmake up your mind.”“Well—” said Mouch, and stopped.“For Christ’s sake, Wesley, what about us?” yelled Taggart.“You’ll come to me,” said Kinnan, “when you’ll need a deal to fix the Board. ButI’ll run that Board. Me and Wesley.”“Do you think the country will stand for it?” yelled Taggart.“Stop kidding yourself,” said Kinnan. “The country? If there aren’t anyprinciples any more—and I guess the doc is right, because there sure aren’t—ifthere aren’t any rules to this game and it’s only a question of who robswhom—then I’ve got more votes than the bunch of you, there are more workers thanemployers, and don’t you forget it, boys!”“That’s a funny attitude to take,” said Taggart haughtily, “about a measurewhich, after all, is not designed for the selfish benefit of workers oremployers, but for the general welfare of the public.”“Okay,” said Kinnan amiably, “let’s talk your lingo. Who is the public? If yougo by quality—then it ain’t you, Jim, and it ain’t Orrie Boyle. If you go byquantity—then it sure is me, because quantity is what I’ve got behind me.” Hissmile disappeared, and with a sudden, bitter look of weariness he added, “OnlyI’m not going to say that I’m working for the welfare of my public, because Iknow I’m not. I know that I’m delivering the poor bastards into slavery, andthat’s all there is to it. And they know it, too. But they know that I’ll haveto throw them a crumb once in a while, if I want to keep my racket, while withthe rest of you they wouldn’t have a chance in hell. So that’s why, if they’vegot to be under a whip, they’d rather I held it, not you—you drooling,tear-jerking, mealy-mouthed bastards of the public welfare! Do you think thatoutside of your college-bred pansies there’s one village idiot whom you’refooling? I’m a racketeer—but I know it and my boys know it, and they know thatI’ll pay off. Not out of the kindness of my heart, either, and not a cent morethan I can get away with, but at least they can count on that much. Sure, itmakes me sick sometimes, it makes me sick right now, but it’s not me who’s builtthis kind of world—you did—so I’m playing the game as you’ve set it up and I’mgoing to play it for as long as it lasts—which isn’t going to be long for any ofus!”He stood up. No one answered him. He let his eyes move slowly from face to faceand stop on Wesley Mouch.“Do I get the Board, Wesley?” he asked casually.“The selection of the specific personnel is only a technical detail,” said Mouchpleasantly. “Suppose we discuss it later, you and I?”Everybody in the room knew that this meant the answer Yes.“Okay, pal,” said Kinnan. He went back to the window, sat down on the sill andlighted a cigarette.For some unadmitted reason, the others were looking at Dr. Ferris, as if seekingguidance.“Don’t be disturbed by oratory,” said Dr. Ferris smoothly. “Mr. Kinnan is a finespeaker, but he has no sense of practical reality. He is unable to thinkdialectically.”There was another silence, then James Taggart spoke up suddenly. “I don’t care.It doesn’t matter. He’ll have to hold things still. Everything will have toremain as it is. Just as it is. Nobody will be permitted to change anything.Except—” He turned sharply to Wesley Mouch. “Wesley, under Point Four, we’llhave to close all research departments, experimental laboratories, scientificfoundations and all the rest of the institutions of that kind. They’ll have tobe forbidden.”“Yes, that’s right,” said Mouch. “I hadn’t thought of that. We’ll have to stickin a couple of lines about that.” He hunted around for a pencil and made a fewscrawls on the margin of his paper.“It will end wasteful competition,” said James Taggart. “We’ll stop scramblingto beat one another to the untried and the unknown. We won’t have to worry aboutnew inventions upsetting the market. We won’t have to pour money down the drainin useless experiments just to keep up with overambitious competitors.”“Yes,” said Orren Boyle. “Nobody should be allowed to waste money on the newuntil everybody has plenty of the old. Close all those damn researchlaboratories—and the sooner, the better.”“Yes,” said Wesley Mouch. “We’ll close them. All of them.”“The State Science Institute, too?” asked Fred Kinnan.“Oh, no!” said Mouch. “That’s different. That’s government. Besides, it’s anon-profit institution. And it will be sufficient to take care of all scientificprogress.”“Quite sufficient,” said Dr. Ferris.“And what will become of all the engineers, professors and such, when you closeall those laboratories?” asked Fred Kinnan. “What are they going to do for aliving, with all the other jobs and businesses frozen?”“Oh,” said Wesley Mouch. He scratched his head. He turned to Mr. Weatherby. “Dowe put them on relief, Clem?”“No,” said Mr. Weatherby. “What for? There’s not enough of them to raise asquawk. Not enough to matter.”“I suppose,” said Mouch, turning to Dr. Ferris, “that you’ll be able to absorbsome of them, Floyd?”“Some,” said Dr. Ferris slowly, as if relishing every syllable of his answer.“Those who prove co-operative.”“What about the rest?” said Fred Kinnan.“They’ll have to wait till the Unification Board finds some use for them,” saidWesley Mouch.“What will they eat while they’re waiting?”Mouch shrugged. “There’s got to be some victims in times of national emergency.It can’t be helped.”“We have the right to do it!” cried Taggart suddenly, in defiance to thestillness of the room. “We need it. We need it, don’t we?” There was no answer.“We have the right to protect our livelihood!” Nobody opposed him, but he wenton with a shrill, pleading, insistence. “We’ll be safe for the first time incenturies. Everybody will know his place and job, and everybody else’s place andjob—and we won’t be at the mercy of every stray crank with a new idea. Nobodywill push us out of business or steal our markets or undersell us or make usobsolete. Nobody will come to us offering some damn new gadget and putting us onthe spot to decide whether we’ll lose our shirt if we buy it, or whether we’lllose our shirt if we don’t but somebody else does! We won’t have to decide.Nobody will be permitted to decide anything. It will be decided once and forall.” His glance moved pleadingly from face to face. “There’s been enoughinvented already—enough for everybody’s comfort—why should they be allowed to goon inventing? Why should we permit them to blast the ground from under our feetevery few steps? Why should we be kept on the go in eternal uncertainty? Justbecause of a few restless, ambitious adventurers? Should we sacrifice thecontentment of the whole of mankind to the greed of a few non-conformists? Wedon’t need them. We don’t need them at all. I wish we’d get rid of that heroworship! Heroes? They’ve done nothing but harm, all through history. They’vekept mankind running a wild race, with no breathing spell, no rest, no ease, nosecurity. Running to catch up with them ... always, without end ... Just as wecatch up, they’re years ahead? ... They leave us no chance ... They’ve neverleft us a chance? ...” His eyes were moving restlessly; he glanced at thewindow, but looked hastily away: he did not want to see the white obelisk in thedistance. “We’re through with them. We’ve won. This is our age. Our world. We’regoing to have security—for the first time in centuries—for the first time sincethe beginning of the industrial revolution!”“Well, this, I guess,” said Fred Kinnan, “is the anti-industrial revolution.”“That’s a damn funny thing for you to say!” snapped Wesley Mouch. “We can’t bepermitted to say that to the public.”“Don’t worry, brother. I won’t say it to the public.”“It’s a total fallacy,” said Dr. Ferris. “It’s a statement prompted byignorance. Every expert has conceded long ago that a planned economy achievesthe maximum of productive efficiency and that centralization leads tosuper-industrialization.”“Centralization destroys the blight of monopoly,” said Boyle.“How’s that again?” drawled Kinnan.Boyle did not catch the tone of mockery, and answered earnestly, “It destroysthe blight of monopoly. It leads to the democratization of industry. It makeseverything available to everybody. Now, for instance, at a time like this, whenthere’s such a desperate shortage of iron ore, is there any sense in my wastingmoney, labor and national resources on making old-fashioned steel, when thereexists a much better metal that I could be making? A metal that everybody wants,but nobody can get. Now is that good economics or sound social efficiency ordemocratic justice? Why shouldn’t I be allowed to manufacture that metal and whyshouldn’t the people get it when they need it? Just because of the privatemonopoly of one selfish individual? Should be sacrifice our rights to hispersonal interests?”“Skip it, brother,” said Fred Kinnan. “I’ve read it all in the same newspapersyou did.”“I don’t like your attitude,” said Boyle, in a sudden tone of righteousness,with a look which, in a barroom, would have signified a prelude to a fist fight.He sat up straight, buttressed by the columns of paragraphs on yellow-tingedpaper, which he was seeing in his mind:“At a time of crucial public need, are we to waste social effort on themanufacture of obsolete products? Are we to let the many remain in want whilethe few withhold from us the better products and methods available? Are we to bestopped by the superstition of patent rights?”“Is it not obvious that private industry is unable to cope with the presenteconomic crisis? How long, for instance, are we going to put up with thedisgraceful shortage of Rearden Metal? There is a crying public demand for it,which Rearden has failed to supply.”“When are we going to put an end to economic injustice and special privileges?Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufacture Rearden Metal?”“I don’t like your attitude,” said Orren Boyle. “So long as we respect therights of the workers, we’ll want you to respect the rights of theindustrialists.”“Which rights of which industrialists?” drawled Kinnan.“I’m inclined to think,” said Dr. Ferris hastily, “that Point Two, perhaps, isthe most essential one of all at present. We must put an end to that peculiarbusiness of industrialists retiring and vanishing. We must stop them. It’splaying havoc with our entire economy.”“Why are they doing it?” asked Taggart nervously. “Where are they all going?”“Nobody knows,” said Dr. Ferris. “We’ve been unable to find any information orexplanation. But it must be stopped. In times of crisis, economic service to thenation is just as much of a duty as military service. Anyone who abandons itshould be regarded as a deserter. I have recommended that we introduce the deathpenalty for those men, but Wesley wouldn’t agree to it.”“Take it easy, boy,” said Fred Kinnan in an odd, slow voice. He sat suddenly andperfectly still, his arms crossed, looking at Ferris in a manner that made itsuddenly real to the room that Ferris had proposed murder. “Don’t let me hearyou talk about any death penalties in industry.”Dr. Ferris shrugged.“We don’t have to go to extremes,” said Mouch hastily. “We don’t want tofrighten people. We want to have them on our side. Our top problem is, will they... will they accept it at all?”“They will,” said Dr. Ferris.“I’m a little worried,” said Eugene Lawson, “about Points Three and Four. Takingover the patents is fine. Nobody’s going to defend industrialists. But I’mworried about taking over the copyrights. That’s going to antagonize theintellectuals. It’s dangerous. It’s a spiritual issue. Doesn’t Point Four meanthat no new books are to be written or published from now on?”“Yes,” said Mouch, “it does. But we can’t make an exception for thebook-publishing business. It’s an industry like any other. When we say ‘no newproducts,’ it’s got to mean ‘no new products.’ ”“But this is a matter of the spirit,” said Lawson; his voice had a tone, not ofrational respect, but of superstitious awe.“We’re not interfering with anybody’s spirit. But when you print a book onpaper, it becomes a material commodity—and if we grant an exception to onecommodity, we won’t be able to hold the others in line and we won’t be able tomake anything stick.”“Yes, that’s true. But—”“Don’t be a chump, Gene,” said Dr. Ferris. “You don’t want some recalcitranthacks to come out with treatises that will wreck our entire program, do you? Ifyou breathe the word censorship’ now, they’ll all scream bloody murder. They’renot ready for it—as yet. But if you leave the spirit alone and make it a simplematerial issue—not a matter of ideas, but just a matter of paper, ink andprinting presses—you accomplish your purpose much more smoothly. You’ll makesure that nothing dangerous gets printed or heard—and nobody is going to fightover a material issue.”“Yes, but ... but I don’t think the writers will like it.”“Are you sure?” asked Wesley Mouch, with a glance that was almost a smile.”Don’t forget that under Point Five, the publishers will have to publish as manybooks as they did in the Basic Year. Since there will be no new ones, they willhave to reprint—and the public will have to buy—some of the old ones. There aremany very worthy books that have never had a fair chance.”“Oh,” said Lawson; he remembered that he had seen Mouch lunching with BalphEubank two weeks ago. Then he shook his head and frowned. “Still, I’m worried.The intellectuals are our friends. We don’t want to lose them. They can make anawful lot of trouble.”“They won’t,” said Fred Kinnan. “Your kind of intellectuals are the first toscream when it’s safe—and the first to shut their traps at the first sign ofdanger. They spend years spitting at the man who feeds them—and they lick thehand of the man who slaps their drooling faces. Didn’t they deliver everycountry of Europe, one after another, to committees of goons, just like this onehere? Didn’t they scream their heads off to shut out every burglar alarm and tobreak every padlock open for the goons? Have you heard a peep out of them since?Didn’t they scream that they were the friends of labor? Do you hear them raisingtheir voices about the chain gangs, the slave camps, the fourteen-hour workdayand the mortality from scurvy in the People’s States of Europe? No, but you dohear them telling the whip-beaten wretches that starvation is prosperity, thatslavery is freedom, that torture chambers are brother-love and that if thewretches don’t understand it, then it’s their own fault that they suffer, andit’s the mangled corpses in the jail cellars who’re to blame for all theirtroubles, not the benevolent leaders! Intellectuals? You might have to worryabout any other breed of men, but not about the modern intellectuals: they’llswallow anything. I don’t feel so safe about the lousiest wharf rat in thelongshoremen’s union: he’s liable to remember suddenly that he is a man—and thenI won’t be able to keep him in line. But the intellectuals? That’s the one thingthey’ve forgotten along ago. I guess it’s the one thing that all their educationwas aimed to make them forget. Do anything you please to the intellectuals.They’ll take it.”“For once,” said Dr. Ferris, “I agree with Mr. Kinnan. I agree with his facts,if not with his feelings. You don’t have to worry about the intellectuals,Wesley. Just put a few of them on the government payroll and send them out topreach precisely the sort of thing Mr. Kinnan mentioned: that the blame rests onthe victims. Give them moderately comfortable salaries and extremely loudtitles—and they’ll forget their copyrights and do a better job for you thanwhole squads of enforcement officers.”“Yes,” said Mouch. “I know.”“The danger that I’m worried about will come from a different quarter,” said Dr.Ferris thoughtfully. “You might run into quite a bit of trouble on that‘voluntary Gift Certificate’ business, Wesley.”“I know,” said Mouch glumly. “That’s the point I wanted Thompson to help us outon. But I guess he can’t. We don’t actually have the legal power to seize thepatents. Oh, there’s plenty of clauses in dozens of laws that can be stretchedto cover it—almost, but not quite. Any tycoon who’d want to make a test casewould have a very good chance to beat us. And we have to preserve a semblance oflegality—or the populace won’t take it.”“Precisely,” said Dr. Ferris. “It’s extremely important to get those patentsturned over to us voluntarily. Even if we had a law permitting outrightnationalization, it would be much better to get them as a gift. We want to leavethe people the illusion that they’re still preserving their private propertyrights. And most of them will play along. They’ll sign the Gift Certificates.Just raise a lot of noise about its being a patriotic duty and that anyone whorefuses is a prince of greed, and they’ll sign. But—” He stopped.“I know,” said Mouch; he was growing visibly more nervous. “There will be, Ithink, a few old-fashioned bastards here and there who’ll refuse to sign—butthey won’t be prominent enough to make a noise, nobody will hear about it, theirown communities and friends will turn against them for their being selfish, soit won’t give us any trouble. We’ll just take the patents over, anyway—and thoseguys won’t have the nerve or the money to start a test case. But—” He stopped.James Taggart leaned back in his chair, watching them; he was beginning to enjoythe conversation.“Yes,” said Dr. Ferris, “I’m thinking of it, too. I’m thinking of a certaintycoon who is in a position to blast us to pieces. Whether we’ll recover thepieces or not, is hard to tell. God knows what is liable to happen at ahysterical time like the present and in a situation as delicate as this.Anything can throw everything off balance. Blow up the whole works. And ifthere’s anyone who wants to do it, he does. He does and can. He knows the realissue, he knows the things which must not be said—and he is not afraid to saythem. He knows the one dangerous, fatally dangerous weapon. He is our deadliestadversary.”“Who?” asked Lawson.Dr. Ferris hesitated, shrugged and answered, “The guiltless man.”Lawson stared blankly. “What do you mean and whom are you talking about?”James Taggart smiled.“I mean that there is no way to disarm any man,” said Dr. Ferris, “exceptthrough guilt. Through that which he himself has accepted as guilt. If a man hasever stolen a dime, you can impose on him the punishment intended for a bankrobber and he will take it. He’ll bear any form of misery, he’ll feel that hedeserves no better. If there’s not enough guilt in the world, we must create it.If we teach a man that it’s evil to look at spring flowers and he believes usand then does it—we’ll be able to do whatever we please with him. He won’tdefend himself. He won’t feel he’s worth it. He won’t fight. But save us fromthe man who lives up to his own standards. Save us from the man of cleanconscience. He’s the man who’ll beat us.”“Are you talking about Henry Rearden?” asked Taggart, his voice peculiarlyclear.The one name they had not wanted to pronounce struck them into an instant’ssilence.“What if I were?” asked Dr. Ferris cautiously.“Oh, nothing,” said Taggart. “Only, if you were, I would tell you that I candeliver Henry Rearden. He’ll sign.”By the rules of their unspoken language, they all knew—from the tone of hisvoice—that he was not bluffing.“God, Jim! No!” gasped Wesley Mouch.“Yes,” said Taggart. “I was stunned, too, when I learned—what I learned. Ididn’t expect that. Anything but that.”“I am glad to hear it,” said Mouch cautiously. “It’s a constructive piece ofinformation. It might be very valuable indeed.”“Valuable—yes,” said Taggart pleasantly. “When do you plan to put the directiveinto effect?”“Oh, we have to move fast. We don’t want any news of it to leak out. I expectyou all to keep this most strictly confidential. I’d say that we’ll be ready tospring it on them in a couple of weeks.”“Don’t you think it would be advisable—before all prices are frozen—to adjustthe matter of the railroad rates? I was thinking of a raise. A small but mostessentially needed raise.”“We’ll discuss it, you and I,” said Mouch amiably. “It might be arranged.” Heturned to the others; Boyle’s face was sagging. “There are many details still tobe worked out, but I’m sure that our program won’t encounter any majordifficulties.” He was assuming the tone and manner of a public address; hesounded brisk and almost cheerful. “Rough spots are to be expected. If one thingdoesn’t work, we’ll try another. Trial-and-error is the only pragmatic rule ofaction. We’ll just keep on trying. If any hardships come up, remember that it’sonly temporary. Only for the duration of the national emergency.”“Say,” asked Kinnan, “how is the emergency to end if everything is to standstill?”“Don’t be theoretical,” said Mouch impatiently. “We’ve got to deal with thesituation of the moment. Don’t bother about minor details, so long as the broadoutlines of our policy are clear. We’ll have the power. We’ll be able to solveany problem and answer any question.”Fred Kinnan chuckled. “Who is John Galt?”“Don’t say that!” cried Taggart.“I have a question to ask about Point Seven,” said Kinnan. “It says that allwages, prices, salaries, dividends, profits and so forth will be frozen on thedate of the directive. Taxes, too?”“Oh no!” cried Mouch. “How can we tell what funds we’ll need in the future?”Kinnan seemed to be smiling. “Well?” snapped Mouch. “What about it?”“Nothing,” said Kinnan. “I just asked.”Mouch leaned back in his chair. “I must say to all of you that I appreciate yourcoming here and giving us the benefit of your opinions. It has been veryhelpful.” He leaned forward to look at his desk calendar and sat over it for amoment, toying with his pencil. Then the pencil came down, struck a date anddrew a circle around it. “Directive 10-289 will go into effect on the morning ofMay first.”All nodded approval. None looked at his neighbor.James Taggart rose, walked to the window and pulled the blind down over thewhite obelisk.026 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_026_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: By the novel’s midpoint, the economy is in a state of collapse.Dagny Taggart has quit as operating vice president of Taggart Transcontinental,and has been replaced by Clifton Locey, a man whose sole motive is to avoidresponsibility.

He slumped forward, his elbow in the puddle, and said:“God damn these railroads! What’s the matter with their track? You’d think withall the money they’ve got they’d disgorge a little, so we wouldn’t have to bumplike farmers on a hay cart!”His three companions did not take the trouble to answer. It was late, and theyremained in the lounge merely because an effort was needed to retire to theircompartments. The lights of the lounge looked like feeble portholes in a fog ofcigarette smoke dank with the odor of alcohol. It was a private car, whichChalmers had demanded and obtained for his journey; it was attached to the endof the Comet and it swung like the tail of a nervous animal as the Comet coiledthrough the curves of the mountains.“I’m going to campaign for the nationalization of the railroads,” said KipChalmers, glaring defiantly at a small, gray man who looked at him withoutinterest. “That’s going to be my platform plank. I’ve got to have a platformplank. I don’t like Jim Taggart. He looks like a soft-boiled clam. To hell withthe railroads! It’s time we took them over.”“Go to bed,” said the man, “if you expect to look like anything human at the bigrally tomorrow.”“Do you think we’ll make it?”“You’ve got to make it.”“I know I’ve got to. But I don’t think we’ll get there on time. This goddamnsnail of a super-special is hours late.”“You’ve got to be there, Kip,” said the man ominously, in that stubborn monotoneof the unthinking which asserts an end without concern for the means.“God damn you, don’t you suppose I know it?”Kip Chalmers had curly blond hair and a shapeless mouth. He came from asemi-wealthy, semi-distinguished family, but he sneered at wealth anddistinction in a manner which implied that only a top-rank aristocrat couldpermit himself such a degree of cynical indifference. He had graduated from acollege which specialized in breeding that kind of aristocracy. The college hadtaught him that the purpose of ideas is to fool those who are stupid enough tothink. He had made his way in Washington with the grace of a cat-burglar,climbing from bureau to bureau as from ledge to ledge of a crumbling structure.He was ranked as semi-powerful, but his manner made laymen mistake him fornothing less than Wesley Mouch.For reasons of his own particular strategy, Kip Chalmers had decided to enterpopular politics and to run for election as Legislator from California, thoughhe knew nothing about that state except the movie industry and the beach clubs.His campaign manager had done the preliminary work, and Chalmers was now on hisway to face his future constituents for the first time at an overpublicizedrally in San Francisco tomorrow night. The manager had wanted him to start a dayearlier, but Chalmers had stayed in Washington to attend a cocktail party andhad taken the last train possible. He had shown no concern about the rally untilthis evening, when he noticed that the Comet was running six hours late.His three companions did not mind his mood: they liked his liquor. Lester Tuck,his campaign manager, was a small, aging man with a face that looked as if ithad once been punched in and had never rebounded. He was an attorney who, somegenerations earlier, would have represented shoplifters and people who stageaccidents on the premises of rich corporations; now he found that he could dobetter by representing men like Kip Chalmers.Laura Bradford was Chalmers’ current mistress; he liked her because hispredecessor had been Wesley Mouch. She was a movie actress who had forced herway from competent featured player to incompetent star, not by means of sleepingwith studio executives, but by taking the long-distance short cut of sleepingwith bureaucrats. She talked economics, instead of glamour, for pressinterviews, in the belligerently righteous style of a third-rate tabloid; hereconomics consisted of the assertion that “we’ve got to help the poor.”Gilbert Keith-Worthing was Chalmers’ guest, for no reason that either of themcould discover. He was a British novelist of world fame, who had been popularthirty years ago; since then, nobody bothered to read what he wrote, buteverybody accepted him as a walking classic. He had been considered profound foruttering such things as: “Freedom? Do let’s stop talking about freedom. Freedomis impossible. Man can never be free of hunger, of cold, of disease, of physicalaccidents. He can never be free of the tyranny of nature. So why should heobject to the tyranny of a political dictatorship?” When all of Europe put intopractice the ideas which he had preached, he came to live in America. Throughthe years, his style of writing and his body had grown flabby. At seventy, hewas an obese old man with retouched hair and a manner of scornful cynicismretouched by quotations from the yogis about the futility of all human endeavor.Kip Chalmers had invited him, because it seemed to look distinguished. GilbertKeith-Worthing had come along, because he had no particular place to go.“God damn these railroad people!” said Kip Chalmers. “They’re doing it onpurpose. They want to ruin my campaign. I can’t miss that rally! For Christ’ssake, Lester, do something!”“I’ve tried,” said Lester Tuck. At the train’s last stop, he had tried, bylong-distance telephone, to find air transportation to complete their journey;but there were no commercial flights scheduled for the next two days.“If they don’t get me there on time, I’ll have their scalps and their railroad!Can’t we tell that damn conductor to hurry?”“You’ve told him three times.”“I’ll get him fired. He’s given me nothing but a lot of alibis about all theirmessy technical troubles. I expect transportation, not alibis. They can’t treatme like one of their day-coach passengers. I expect them to get me where I wantto go when I want it. Don’t they know that I’m on this train?”“They know it by now,” said Laura Bradford. “Shut up, Kip. You bore me.”Chalmers refilled his glass. The car was rocking and the glassware tinkledfaintly on the shelves of the bar. The patches of starlit sky in the windowskept swaying jerkily, and it seemed as if the stars were tinkling against oneanother. They could see nothing beyond the glass bay of the observation windowat the end of the car, except the small halos of red and green lanterns markingthe rear of the train, and a brief stretch of rail running away from them intothe darkness. A wall of rock was racing the train, and the stars dippedoccasionally into a sudden break that outlined, high above them, the peaks ofthe mountains of Colorado.“Mountains ...” said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, with satisfaction. “It is aspectacle of this kind that makes one feel the insignificance of man. What isthis presumptuous little bit of rail, which crude materialists are so proud ofbuilding—compared to that eternal grandeur? No more than the basting thread of aseamstress on the hem of the garment of nature. If a single one of those granitegiants chose to crumble, it would annihilate this train.”“Why should it choose to crumble?” asked Laura Bradford, without any particularinterest.“I think this damn train is going slower,” said Kip Chalmers. “Those bastardsare slowing down, in spite of what I told them!”“Well ... it’s the mountains, you know ...” said Lester Tuck.“Mountains be damned! Lester, what day is this? With all those damn changes oftime, I can’t tell which—”“It’s May twenty-seventh,” sighed Lester Tuck.“It’s May twenty-eighth,” said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, glancing at his watch.“It is now twelve minutes past midnight.”“Jesus!” cried Chalmers. “Then the rally is today?”“Yep,” said Lester Tuck.“We won’t make it! We—”The train gave a sharper lurch, knocking the glass out of his hand. The thinsound of its crash against the floor mixed with the screech of the wheel-flangestearing against the rail of a sharp curve.“I say,” asked Gilbert Keith-Worthing nervously, “are your railroads safe?”“Hell, yes!” said Kip Chalmers. “We’ve got so many rules, regulations andcontrols that those bastards wouldn’t dare not to be safe!... Lester, how farare we now? What’s the next stop?”“There won’t be any stop till Salt Lake City.”“I mean, what’s the next station?”Lester Tuck produced a soiled map, which he had been consulting every fewminutes since nightfall. “Winston,” he said. “Winston, Colorado.”Kip Chalmers reached for another glass.“Tinky Holloway said that Wesley said that if you don’t win this election,you’re through,” said Laura Bradford. She sat sprawled in her chair, lookingpast Chalmers, studying her own face in a mirror on the wall of the lounge; shewas bored and it amused her to needle his impotent anger.“Oh, he did, did he?”“Uh-huh. Wesley doesn’t want what’s-his-name—whoever’s running against you—toget into the Legislature. If you don’t win, Wesley will be sore as hell. Tinkysaid—”“Damn that bastard! He’d better watch his own neck!”“Oh, I don’t know. Wesley likes him very much.” She added, “Tinky Hollowaywouldn’t allow some miserable train to make him miss an important meeting. Theywouldn’t dare to hold him up.”Kip Chalmers sat staring at his glass. “I’m going to have the government seizeall the railroads,” he said, his voice low.“Really,” said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, “I don’t see why you haven’t done it longago. This is the only country on earth backward enough to permit privateownership of railroads.”“Well, we’re catching up with you,” said Kip Chalmers.“Your country is so incredibly naive. It’s such an anachronism. All that talkabout liberty and human rights—I haven’t heard it since the days of mygreat-grandfather. It’s nothing but a verbal luxury of the rich. After all, itdoesn’t make any difference to the poor whether their livelihood is at the mercyof an industrialist or a bureaucrat.”“The day of the industrialists is over. This is the day of—”The jolt felt as if the air within the car smashed them forward while the floorstopped under their feet. Kip Chalmers was flung down to the carpet. GilbertKeith-Worthing was thrown across the table top, the lights were blasted out.Glasses crashed off the shelves, the steel of the walls screamed as if about torip open, while a long, distant thud went like a convulsion through the wheelsof the train.When he raised his head, Chalmers saw that the car stood intact and still; heheard the moans of his companions and the first shriek of Laura Bradford’shysterics. He crawled along the floor to the doorway, wrenched it open, andtumbled down the steps. Far ahead, on the side of a curve, he saw movingflashlights and a red glow at a spot where the engine had no place to be. Hestumbled through the darkness, bumping into half-clothed figures that waved thefutile little flares of matches. Somewhere along the line, he saw a man with aflashlight and seized his arm. It was the conductor.“What happened?” gasped Chalmers.“Split rail,” the conductor answered impassively. “The engine went off thetrack.”“Off ... ?”“On it’s side.”“Anybody ... killed?”“No. The engineer’s all right. The fireman is hurt.”“Split rail? What do you mean, split rail?”The conductor’s face had an odd look: it was grim, accusing and closed. “Railwears out, Mr. Chalmers,” he answered with a strange kind of emphasis.“Particularly on curves.”“Didn’t you know that it was worn out?”“We knew.”“Well, why didn’t you have it replaced?”“It was going to be replaced. But Mr. Locey cancelled that.”“Who is Mr. Locey?”“The man who is not our Operating Vice-President.”Chalmers wondered why the conductor seemed to look at him as if something aboutthe catastrophe were his fault. “Well ... well, aren’t you going to put theengine back on the track?”“That engine’s never going to be put back on any track, from the looks of it.”“But ... it’s got to move us!”“It can’t.”Beyond the few moving flares and the dulled sounds of screams, Chalmers sensedsuddenly, not wanting to look at it, the black immensity of the mountains, thesilence of hundreds of uninhabited miles, and the precarious strip of a ledgehanging between a wall of rock and an abyss. He gripped the conductor’s armtighter.“But ... but what are we going to do?”“The engineer’s gone to call Winston.”“Call? How?”“There’s a phone couple of miles down the track.”“Will they get us out of here?”“They will.”“But ...” Then his mind made a connection with the past and the future, and hisvoice rose to a scream for the first time: “How long will we have to wait?”“I don’t know,” said the conductor. He threw Chalmers’ hand off his arm, andwalked away.The night operator at Winston Station listened to the phone message, dropped thereceiver and raced up the stairs to shake the station agent out of bed. Thestation agent was a husky, surly drifter who had been assigned to the job tendays ago, by order of the new division superintendent. He stumbled dazedly tohis feet, but he was knocked awake when the operator’s words reached his brain.“What?” he gasped. “Jesus! The Comet? ... Well, don’t stand there shaking! CallSilver Springs!”The night dispatcher of the Division Headquarters at Silver Springs listened tothe message, then telephoned Dave Mitchum, the new superintendent of theColorado Division.“The Comet?” gasped Mitchum, his hand pressing the telephone receiver to hisear, his feet hitting the floor and throwing him upright, out of bed, “Theengine done for? The Diesel?”“Yes, sir.”“Oh God! Oh, God Almighty! What are we going to do?” Then, remembering hisposition, he added, “Well, send out the wrecking train.”“I have.”“Call the operator at Sherwood to hold all traffic.”“I have.”“What have you got on the sheet?”“The Army Freight Special, westbound. But it’s not due for about four hours.It’s running late.”“I’ll be right down.... Wait, listen, get Bill, Sandy and Clarence down by thetime I get there. There’s going to be hell to pay!”Dave Mitchum had always complained about injustice, because, he said, he hadalways had bad luck. He explained it by speaking darkly about the conspiracy ofthe big fellows, who would never give him a chance, though he did not explainjust whom he meant by “the big fellows.” Seniority of service was his favoritetopic of complaint and sole standard of value; he had been in the railroadbusiness longer than many men who had advanced beyond him; this, he said, wasproof of the social system’s injustice—though he never explained just what hemeant by “the social system.” He had worked for many railroads, but had notstayed long with any one of them. His employers had had no specific misdeeds tocharge against him, but had simply eased him out, because he said, “Nobody toldme to!” too often. He did not know that he owed his present job to a dealbetween James Taggart and Wesley Mouch: when Taggart traded to Mouch the secretof his sister’s private life, in exchange for a raise in rates, Mouch made himthrow in an extra favor, by their customary rules of bargaining, which consistedof squeezing all one could out of any given trade. The extra was a job for DaveMitchum, who was the brother-in-law of Claude Slagenhop, who was the presidentof the Friends of Global Progress, who were regarded by Mouch as a valuableinfluence on public opinion. James Taggart pushed the responsibility of findinga job for Mitchum onto Clifton Locey. Locey pushed Mitchum into the first jobthat came up—superintendent of the Colorado Division—when the man holding itquit without notice. The man quit when the extra Diesel engine of WinstonStation was given to Chick Morrison’s Special.“What are we going to do?” cried Dave Mitchum, rushing, half-dressed and groggywith sleep, into his office, where the chief dispatcher, the trainmaster and theroad foreman of engines were waiting for him.The three men did not answer. They were middle-aged men with years of railroadservice behind them. A month ago, they were beginning to learn that things hadchanged and that it was dangerous to speak.“What in hell are we going to do?”“One thing is certain,” said Bill Brent, the chief dispatcher. “We can’t send atrain into the tunnel with a coal-burning engine.”Dave Mitchum’s eyes grew sullen: he knew that this was the one thought on alltheir minds; he wished Brent had not named it.“Well, where do we get a Diesel?” he asked angrily.“We don’t,” said the road foreman.“But we can’t keep the Comet waiting on a siding all night!”“Looks like we’ll have to,” said the trainmaster. “What’s the use of talkingabout it, Dave? You know that there is no Diesel anywhere on the division.”“But Christ Almighty, how do they expect us to move trains without engines?”“Miss Taggart didn’t,” said the road foreman. “Mr. Locey does.”“Bill,” asked Mitchum, in the tone of pleading for a favor, “isn’t thereanything transcontinental that’s due tonight, with any sort of a Diesel?”“The first one to come,” said Bill Brent implacably, “will be Number 236, thefast freight from San Francisco, which is due at Winston at seven-eighteen A.M.”He added, “That’s the Diesel closest to us at this moment. I’ve checked.”“What about the Army Special?”“Better not think about it, Dave. That one has priority over everything on theline, including the Comet, by order of the Army. They’re running late as itis—journal boxes caught fire twice. They’re carrying munitions for the WestCoast arsenals. Better pray that nothing stops them on your division. If youthink we’ll catch hell for holding the Comet, it’s nothing to what we’ll catchif we try to stop that Special.”They remained silent. The windows were open to the summer night and they couldhear the ringing of the telephone in the dispatcher’s office downstairs. Thesignal lights winked over the deserted yards that had once been a busy divisionpoint.Mitchum looked toward the roundhouse, where the black silhouettes of a few steamengines stood outlined in a dim light.“The tunnel—” he said and stopped.“—is eight miles long,” said the trainmaster, with a harsh emphasis.“I was only thinking,” snapped Mitchum.“Better not think of it,” said Brent softly.“I haven’t said anything!”“What was that talk you had with Dick Horton before he quit?” the road foremanasked too innocently, as if the subject were irrelevant. “Wasn’t it somethingabout the ventilation system of the tunnel being on the bum? Didn’t he say thatthe tunnel was hardly safe nowadays even for Diesel engines?”“Why do you bring that up?” snapped Mitchum. “I haven’t said anything!” DickHorton, the division chief engineer, had quit three days after Mitchum’sarrival.“I thought I’d just mention it,” the road foreman answered innocently.“Look, Dave,” said Bill Brent, knowing that Mitchum would stall for another hourrather than formulate a decision, “you know that there’s only one thing to do:hold the Comet at Winston till morning, wait for Number 236, have her Dieseltake the Comet through the tunnel, then let the Comet finish her run with thebest coal-burner we can give her on the other side.”“But how late will that make her?”Brent shrugged. “Twelve hours—eighteen hours—who knows?”“Eighteen hours—for the Comet? Christ, that’s never happened before! ”“None of what’s been happening to us has ever happened before,” said Brent, withan astonishing sound of weariness in his brisk, competent voice.“But they’ll blame us for it in New York! They’ll put all the blame on us!”Brent shrugged. A month ago, he would have considered such an injusticeinconceivable; today, he knew better.“I guess ...” said Mitchum miserably, “I guess there’s nothing else that we cando.”“There isn’t, Dave.”“Oh God! Why did this have to happen to us?”“Who is John Galt?”It was half-past two when the Comet, pulled by an old switch engine, jerked to astop on a siding of Winston Station. Kip Chalmers glanced out with incredulousanger at the few shanties on a desolate mountainside and at the ancient hovel ofa station.“Now what? What in hell are they stopping here for?” he cried, and rang for theconductor.With the return of motion and safety, his terror had turned into rage. He feltalmost as if he had been cheated by having been made to experience anunnecessary fear. His companions were still clinging to the tables of thelounge; they felt too shaken to sleep.“How long?” the conductor said impassively, in answer to his question. “Tillmorning, Mr. Chalmers.”Chalmers stared at him, stupefied. “We’re going to stand here till morning?”“Yes, Mr. Chalmers.”“Here?”“Yes.”“But I have a rally in San Francisco in the evening!”The conductor did not answer.“Why? Why do we have to stand? Why in hell? What happened?”Slowly, patiently, with contemptuous politeness, the conductor gave him an exactaccount of the situation. But years ago, in grammar school, in high school, incollege, Kip Chalmers had been taught that man does not and need not live byreason.“Damn your tunnel!” he screamed. “Do you think I’m going to let you hold me upbecause of some miserable tunnel? Do you want to wreck vital national plans onaccount of a tunnel? Tell your engineer that I must be in San Francisco byevening and that he’s got to get me there!”“How?”“That’s your job, not mine!”“There is no way to do it.”“Then find a way, God damn you!”The conductor did not answer.“Do you think I’ll let your miserable technological problems interfere withcrucial social issues? Do you know who I am? Tell that engineer to start moving,if he values his job!”“The engineer has his orders.”“Orders be damned! I give the orders these days! Tell him to start at once!”“Perhaps you’d better speak to the station agent, Mr. Chalmers. I have noauthority to answer you as I’d like to,” said the conductor, and walked out.Chalmers leaped to his feet. “Say, Kip ...” said Lester Tuck uneasily, “maybeit’s true ... maybe they can’t do it.”“They can if they have to!” snapped Chalmers, marching resolutely to the door.Years ago, in college, he had been taught that the only effective means to impelmen to action was fear.In the dilapidated office of Winston Station, he confronted a sleepy man withslack, worn features, and a frightened young boy who sat at the operator’s desk.They listened, in silent stupor, to a stream of profanity such as they had neverheard from any section gang.“—and it’s not my problem how you get the train through the tunnel, that’s foryou to figure out!” Chalmers concluded. “But if you don’t get me an engine anddon’t start that train, you can kiss good-bye to your jobs, your work permitsand this whole goddamn railroad!”The station agent had never heard of Kip Chalmers and did not know the nature ofhis position. But he knew that this was the day when unknown men in undefinedpositions held unlimited power—the power of life or death.“It’s not up to us, Mr. Chalmers,” he said pleadingly. “We don’t issue theorders out here. The order came from Silver Springs. Suppose you telephone Mr.Mitchum and—”“Who’s Mr. Mitchum?”“He’s the division superintendent at Silver Springs. Suppose you send him amessage to—”“I should bother with a division superintendent! I’ll send a message to JimTaggart—that’s what I’m going to do!”Before the station agent had time to recover, Chalmers whirled to the boy,ordering, “You—take this down and send it at once!”It was a message which, a month ago, the station agent would not have acceptedfrom any passenger; the rules forbade it; but he was not certain about any rulesany longer:Mr. James Taggart, New York City. Am held up on the Comet at Winston, Colorado,by the incompetence of your men, who refuse to give me an engine. Have meetingin San Francisco in the evening of top-level national importance. If you don’tmove my train at once, I’ll let you guess the consequences.Kip Chalmers.After the boy had transmitted the words onto the wires that stretched from poleto pole across a continent as guardians of the Taggart track—after Kip Chalmershad returned to his car to wait for an answer—the station agent telephoned DaveMitchum, who was his friend, and read to him the text of the message. He heardMitchum groan in answer.“I thought I’d tell you, Dave. I never heard of the guy before, but maybe he’ssomebody important.”“I don’t know!” moaned Mitchum. “Kip Chalmers? You see his name in thenewspapers all the time, right in with all the top-level boys. I don’t know whathe is, but if he’s from Washington, we can’t take any chances. Oh Christ, whatare we going to do?”We can’t take any chances—thought the Taggart operator in New York, andtransmitted the message by telephone to James Taggart’s home. It was close tosix A.M. in New York, and James Taggart was awakened out of the fitful sleep ofa restless night. He listened to the telephone, his face sagging. He felt thesame fear as the station agent of Winston, and for the same reason.He called the home of Clifton Locey. All the rage which he could not pour uponKip Chalmers, was poured over the telephone wire upon Clifton Locey. “Dosomething!” screamed Taggart. “I don’t care what you do, it’s your job, notmine, but see to it that that train gets through! What in hell is going on? Inever heard of the Comet being held up! Is that how you run your department?It’s a fine thing when important passengers have to start sending messages tome! At least, when my sister ran the place, I wasn’t awakened in the middle ofthe night over every spike that broke in Iowa—Colorado, I mean!”“I’m so sorry, Jim,” said Clifton Locey smoothly, in a tone that balancedapology, reassurance and the right degree of patronizing confidence. “It’s justa misunderstanding. It’s somebody’s stupid mistake. Don’t worry, I’ll take careof it. I was, as a matter of fact, in bed, but I’ll attend to it at once.”Clifton Locey was not in bed; he had just returned from a round of night clubs,in the company of a young lady. He asked her to wait and hurried to the officesof Taggart Transcontinental. None of the night staff who saw him there could saywhy he chose to appear in person, but neither could they say that it had beenunnecessary. He rushed in and out of several offices, was seen by many peopleand gave an impression of great activity. The only physical result of it was anorder that went over the wires to Dave Mitchum, superintendent of the ColoradoDivision:“Give an engine to Mr. Chalmers at once. Send the Comet through safely andwithout unnecessary delay. If you are unable to perform your duties, I shallhold you responsible before the Unification Board. Clifton Locey.”Then, calling his girl friend to join him, Clifton Locey drove to a countryroadhouse—to make certain that no one would be able to find him in the next fewhours.The dispatcher at Silver Springs was baffled by the order that he handed to DaveMitchum, but Dave Mitchum understood. He knew that no railroad order would everspeak in such terms as giving an engine to a passenger; he knew that the thingwas a show piece, he guessed what sort of show was being staged, and he felt acold sweat at the realization of who was being framed as the goat of the show.“What’s the matter, Dave?” asked the trainmaster.Mitchum did not answer. He seized the telephone, his hands shaking as he beggedfor a connection to the Taggart operator in New York. He looked like an animalin a trap.He begged the New York operator to get him Mr. Clifton Locey’s home. Theoperator tried. There was no answer. He begged the operator to keep on tryingand to try every number he could think of, where Mr. Locey might be found. Theoperator promised and Mitchum hung up, but knew that it was useless to wait orto speak to anyone in Mr. Locey’s department.“What’s the matter, Dave?”Mitchum handed him the order—and saw by the look on the trainmaster’s face thatthe trap was as bad as he had suspected.He called the Region Headquarters of Taggart Transcontinental at Omaha,Nebraska, and begged to speak to the general manager of the region. There was abrief silence on the wire, then the voice of the Omaha operator told him thatthe general manager had resigned and vanished three days ago—“over a littletrouble with Mr. Locey,” the voice added.He asked to speak to the assistant general manager in charge of his particulardistrict; but the assistant was out of town for the week end and could not bereached.“Get me somebody else!” Mitchum screamed. “Anybody, of any district! ForChrist’s sake, get me somebody who’ll tell me what to do!”The man who came on the wire was the assistant general manager of theIowa-Minnesota District.“What?” he interrupted at Mitchum’s first words. “At Winston, Colorado? Why inhell are you calling me? ... No, don’t tell me what happened, I don’t want toknow it! ... No, I said! No! You’re not going to frame me into having to explainafterwards why I did or didn’t do anything about whatever it is. It’s not myproblem! ... Speak to some region executive, don’t pick on me, what do I have todo with Colorado? ... Oh hell, I don’t know, get the chief engineer, speak tohim!”The chief engineer of the Central Region answered impatiently, “Yes? What? Whatis it?”—and Mitchum rushed desperately to explain. When the chief engineer heardthat there was no Diesel, he snapped, “Then hold the train, of course!” When heheard about Mr. Chalmers, he said, his voice suddenly subdued, “Hm ... KipChalmers? Of Washington? ... Well, I don’t know. That would be a matter for Mr.Locey to decide.” When Mitchum said, “Mr. Locey ordered me to arrange it, but—”the chief engineer snapped in great relief, “Then do exactly as Mr. Locey says!”and hung up.Dave Mitchum replaced the telephone receiver cautiously. He did not scream anylonger. Instead, he tiptoed to a chair, almost as if he were sneaking. He satlooking at Mr. Locey’s order for a long time.Then he snatched a glance about the room. The dispatcher was busy at histelephone. The trainmaster and the road foreman were there, but they pretendedthat they were not waiting. He wished Bill Brent, the chief dispatcher, would gohome; Bill Brent stood in a corner, watching him.Brent was a short, thin man with broad shoulders; he was forty, but lookedyounger; he had the pale face of an office worker and the hard, lean features ofa cowboy. He was the best dispatcher on the system.Mitchum rose abruptly and walked upstairs to his office, clutching Locey’s orderin his hand.Dave Mitchum was not good at understanding problems of engineering andtransportation, but he understood men like Clifton Locey. He understood the kindof game the New York executives were playing and what they were now doing tohim. The order did not tell him to give Mr. Chalmers a coal-burning engine—just“an engine.” If the time came to answer questions, wouldn’t Mr. Locey gasp inshocked indignation that he had expected a division superintendent to know thatonly a Diesel engine could be meant in that order? The order stated that he wasto send the Comet through “safely”—wasn’t a division superintendent expected toknow what was safe?—“and without unnecessary delay.” What was an unnecessarydelay? If the possibility of a major disaster was involved, wouldn’t a delay ofa week or a month be considered necessary?The New York executives did not care, thought Mitchum; they did not care whetherMr. Chalmers reached his meeting on time, or whether an unprecedentedcatastrophe struck their rails; they cared only about making sure that theywould not be blamed for either. If he held the train, they would make him thescapegoat to appease the anger of Mr. Chalmers; if he sent the train through andit did not reach the western portal of the tunnel, they would put the blame onhis incompetence; they would claim that he had acted against their orders, ineither case. What would he be able to prove? To whom? One could prove nothing toa tribunal that had no stated policy, no defined procedure, no rules ofevidence, no binding principles—a tribunal, such as the Unification Board, thatpronounced men guilty or innocent as it saw fit, with no standard of guilt orinnocence.Dave Mitchum knew nothing about the philosophy of law; but he knew that when acourt is not bound by any rules, it is not bound by any facts, and then ahearing is not an issue of justice, but an issue of men, and your fate dependsnot on what you have or have not done, but on whom you do or do not know. Heasked himself what chance he would have at such a hearing against Mr. JamesTaggart, Mr. Clifton Locey, Mr. Kip Chalmers and their powerful friends.Dave Mitchum had spent his life slipping around the necessity of ever making adecision; he had done it by waiting to be told and never being certain ofanything. All that he now allowed into his brain was a long, indignant whineagainst injustice. Fate, he thought, had singled him out for an unfair amount ofbad luck: he was being framed by his superiors on the only good job he had everheld. He had never been taught to understand that the manner in which heobtained this job, and the frame-up, were inextricable parts of a single whole.As he looked at Locey’s order, he thought that he could hold the Comet, attachMr. Chalmers’ car to an engine and send it into the tunnel, alone. But he shookhis head before the thought was fully formed: he knew that this would force Mr.Chalmers to recognize the nature of the risk: Mr. Chalmers would refuse; hewould continue to demand a safe and non-existent engine. And more: this couldmean that he, Mitchum, would have to assume responsibility, admit full knowledgeof the danger, stand in the open and identify the exact nature of thesituation—the one act which the policy of his superiors was based on evading,the one key to their game.Dave Mitchum was not the man to rebel against his background or to question themoral code of those in charge. The choice he made was not to challenge, but tofollow the policy of his superiors. Bill Brent could have beaten him in anycontest of technology, but here was an endeavor at which he could beat BillBrent without effort. There had once been a society where men needed theparticular talents of Bill Brent, if they wished to survive; what they needednow was the talent of Dave Mitchum.Dave Mitchum sat down at his secretary’s typewriter and, by means of twofingers, carefully typed out an order to the trainmaster and another to the roadforeman. The first instructed the trainmaster to summon a locomotive crew atonce, for a purpose described only as “an emergency”; the second instructed theroad foreman to “send the best engine available to Winston, to stand by foremergency assistance.”He put carbon copies of the orders into his own pocket, then opened the door,yelled for the night dispatcher to come up and handed him the two orders for thetwo men downstairs. The night dispatcher was a conscientious young boy whotrusted his superiors and knew that discipline was the first rule of therailroad business. He was astonished that Mitchum should wish to send writtenorders down one flight of stairs, but he asked no questions.Mitchum waited nervously. After a while, he saw the figure of the road foremanwalking across the yards toward the roundhouse. He felt relieved: the two menhad not come up to confront him in person; they had understood and they wouldplay the game as he was playing it.The road foreman walked across the yards, looking down at the ground. He wasthinking of his wife, his two children and the house which he had spent alifetime to own. He knew what his superiors were doing and he wondered whetherhe should refuse to obey them. He had never been afraid of losing his job; withthe confidence of a competent man, he had known that if he quarreled with oneemployer, he would always be able to find another. Now, he was afraid; he had noright to quit or to seek a job; if he defied an employer, he would be deliveredinto the unanswerable power of a single Board, and if the Board ruled againsthim, it would mean being sentenced to the slow death of starvation: it wouldmean being barred from any employment. He knew that the Board would rule againsthim; he knew that the key to the dark, capricious mystery of the Board’scontradictory decisions was the secret power of pull. What chance would he haveagainst Mr. Chalmers? There had been a time when the self-interest of hisemployers had demanded that he exercise his utmost ability. Now, ability was notwanted any longer. There had been a time when he had been required to do hisbest and rewarded accordingly. Now, he could expect nothing but punishment, ifhe tried to follow his conscience. There had been a time when he had beenexpected to think. Now, they did not want him to think, only to obey. They didnot want him to have a conscience any longer. Then why should he raise hisvoice? For whose sake? He thought of the passengers—the three hundred passengersaboard the Comet. He thought of his children. He had a son in high school and adaughter, nineteen, of whom he was fiercely, painfully proud, because she wasrecognized as the most beautiful girl in town. He asked himself whether he coulddeliver his children to the fate of the children of the unemployed, as he hadseen them in the blighted areas, in the settlements around closed factories andalong the tracks of discontinued railroads. He saw, in astonished horror, thatthe choice which he now had to make was between the lives of his children andthe lives of the passengers on the Comet. A conflict of this kind had never beenpossible before. It was by protecting the safety of the passengers that he hadearned the security of his children; he had served one by serving the other;there had been no clash of interests, no call for victims. Now, if he wanted tosave the passengers, he had to do it at the price of his children. He remembereddimly the sermons he had heard about the beauty of self-immolation, about thevirtue of sacrificing to others that which was one’s dearest. He knew nothingabout the philosophy of ethics; but he knew suddenly—not in words, but in theform of a dark, angry, savage pain—that if this was virtue, then he wanted nopart of it.He walked into the roundhouse and ordered a large, ancient coal-burninglocomotive to be made ready for the run to Winston.The trainmaster reached for the telephone in the dispatcher’s office, to summonan engine crew, as ordered. But his hand stopped, holding the receiver. Itstruck him suddenly that he was summoning men to their death, and that of thetwenty lives listed on the sheet before him, two would be ended by his choice.He felt a physical sensation of cold, nothing more; he felt no concern, only apuzzled, indifferent astonishment. It had never been his job to call men out todie; his job had been to call them out to earn their living. It was strange, hethought; and it was strange that his hand had stopped; what made it stop waslike something he would have felt twenty years ago—no, he thought, strange, onlyone month ago, not longer.He was forty-eight years old. He had no family, no friends, no ties to anyliving being in the world. Whatever capacity for devotion he had possessed, thecapacity which others scatter among many random concerns, he had given it wholeto the person of his young brother—the brother, his junior by twenty-five years,whom he had brought up. He had sent him through a technological college, and hehad known, as had all the teachers, that the boy had the mark of genius on theforehead of his grim, young face. With the same single-tracked devotion as hisbrother’s, the boy had cared for nothing but his studies, not for sports orparties or girls, only for the vision of the things he was going to create as aninventor. He had graduated from college and had gone, on a salary unusual forhis age, into the research laboratory of a great electrical concern inMassachusetts.This was now May 28, thought the trainmaster. It was on May 1 that Directive10-289 had been issued. It was on the evening of May 1 that he had been informedthat his brother had committed suicide.The trainmaster had heard it said that the directive was necessary to save thecountry. He could not know whether this was true or not; he had no way ofknowing what was necessary to save a country. But driven by some feeling whichhe could not express, he had walked into the office of the editor of the localnewspaper and demanded that they publish the story of his brother’s death.“People have to know it,” had been all he could give as his reason. He had beenunable to explain that the bruised connections of his mind had formed thewordless conclusion that if this was done by the will of the people, then thepeople had to know it; he could not believe that they would do it, if they knew.The editor had refused; he had stated that it would be bad for the country’smorale.The trainmaster knew nothing about political philosophy; but he knew that thathad been the moment when he lost all concern for the life or death of any humanbeing or of the country.He thought, holding the telephone receiver, that maybe he should warn the menwhom he was about to call. They trusted him; it would never occur to them thathe could knowingly send them to their death. But he shook his head: this wasonly an old thought, last year’s thought, a remnant of the time when he hadtrusted them, too. It did not matter now. His brain worked slowly, as if he weredragging his thoughts through a vacuum where no emotion responded to spur themon; he thought that there would be trouble if he warned anyone, there would besome sort of fight and it was he who had to make some great effort to start it.He had forgotten what it was that one started this sort of fight for. Truth?Justice? Brother-love? He did not want to make an effort. He was very tired. Ifhe warned all the men on his list, he thought, there would be no one to run thatengine, so he would save two lives and also three hundred lives aboard theComet. But nothing responded to the figures in his mind; “lives” was just aword, it had no meaning.He raised the telephone receiver to his ear, he called two numbers, he summonedan engineer and a fireman to report for duty at once.Engine Number 306 had left for Winston, when Dave Mitchum came downstairs. “Geta track motor car ready for me,” he ordered, “I’m going to run up to Fairmount.”Fairmount was a small station, twenty miles east on the line. The men nodded,asking no questions. Bill Brent was not among them. Mitchum walked into Brent’soffice. Brent was there, sitting silently at his desk; he seemed to be waiting.“I’m going to Fairmount,” said Mitchum; his voice was aggressively too casual,as if implying that no answer was necessary. “They had a Diesel there couple ofweeks ago ... you know, emergency repairs or something.... I’m going down to seeif we could use it.”He paused, but Brent said nothing.“The way things stack up,” said Mitchum, not looking at him, “we can’t hold thattrain till morning. We’ve got to take a chance, one way or another. Now I thinkmaybe this Diesel will do it, but that’s the last one we can try for. So if youdon’t hear from me in half an hour, sign the order and send the Comet throughwith Number 306 to pull her.”Whatever Brent had thought, he could not believe it when he heard it. He did notanswer at once; then he said, very quietly, “No.”“What do you mean, no?”“I won’t do it.”“What do you mean, you won’t? It’s an order!”“I won’t do it.” Brent’s voice had the firmness of certainty unclouded by anyemotion.“Are you refusing to obey an order?”“I am.”“But you have no right to refuse! And I’m not going to argue about it, either.It’s what I’ve decided, it’s my responsibility and I’m not asking for youropinion. Your job is to take my orders.”“Will you give me that order in writing?”“Why, God damn you, are you hinting that you don’t trust me? Are you ...?”“Why do you have to go to Fairmount, Dave? Why can’t you telephone them aboutthe Diesel, if you think that they have one?”“You’re not going to tell me how to do my job! You’re not going to sit there andquestion me! You’re going to keep your trap shut and do as you’re told or I’llgive you a chance to talk—to the Unification Board!”It was hard to decipher emotions on Brent’s cowboy face, but Mitchum sawsomething that resembled a look of incredulous horror; only it was horror atsome sight of his own, not at the words, and it had no quality of fear, not thekind of fear Mitchum had hoped for.Brent knew that tomorrow morning the issue would be his word against Mitchum’s;Mitchum would deny having given the order; Mitchum would show written proof thatEngine Number 306 had been sent to Winston only “to stand by,” and would producewitnesses that he had gone to Fairmount in search of a Diesel; Mitchum wouldclaim that the fatal order had been issued by and on the sole responsibility ofBill Brent, the chief dispatcher. It would not be much of a case, not a casethat could bear close study, but it would be enough for the Unification Board,whose policy was consistent only in not permitting anything to be studiedclosely. Brent knew that he could play the same game and pass the frame-up on toanother victim, he knew that he had the brains to work it out—except that hewould rather be dead than do it.It was not the sight of Mitchum that made him sit still in horror. It was therealization that there was no one whom he could call to expose this thing andstop it—no superior anywhere on the line, from Colorado to Omaha to New York.They were in on it, all of them, they were doing the same, they had givenMitchum the lead and the method. It was Dave Mitchum who now belonged on thisrailroad and he, Bill Brent, who did not.As Bill Brent had learned to see, by a single glance at a few numbers on a sheetof paper, the entire trackage of a division—so he was now able to see the wholeof his own life and the full price of the decision he was making. He had notfallen in love until he was past his youth; he had been thirty-six when he hadfound the woman he wanted. He had been engaged to her for the last four years;he had had to wait, because he had a mother to support and a widowed sister withthree children. He had never been afraid of burdens, because he had known hisability to carry them, and he had never assumed an obligation unless he wascertain that he could fulfill it. He had waited, he had saved his money, and nowhe had reached the time when he felt himself free to be happy. He was to bemarried in a few weeks, this coming June. He thought of it, as he sat at hisdesk, looking at Dave Mitchum, but the thought aroused no hesitation, onlyregret and a distant sadness—distant, because he knew that he could not let itbe part of this moment.Bill Brent knew nothing about epistemology; but he knew that man must live byhis own rational perception of reality, that he cannot act against it or escapeit or find a substitute for it—and that there is no other way for him to live.He rose to his feet. “It’s true that so long as I hold this job, I cannot refuseto obey you,” he said. “But I can, if I quit. So I’m quitting.”“You’re what?”“I’m quitting, as of this moment.”“But you have no right to quit, you goddamn bastard! Don’t you know that? Don’tyou know that I’ll have you thrown in jail for it?”“If you want to send the sheriff for me in the morning, I’ll be at home. I won’ttry to escape. There’s no place to go.”Dave Mitchum was six-foot-two and had the build of a bruiser, but he stoodshaking with fury and terror over the delicate figure of Bill Brent. “You can’tquit! There’s a law against it! I’ve got a law! You can’t walk out on me! Iwon’t let you out! I won’t let you leave this building tonight!”Brent walked to the door. “Will you repeat that order you gave me, in front ofthe others? No? Then I will.”As he pulled the door open, Mitchum’s fist shot out, smashed into his face andknocked him down.The trainmaster and the road foreman stood in the open doorway.“He quit!” screamed Mitchum. “The yellow bastard quit at a time like this! He’sa law-breaker and a coward!”In the slow effort of rising from the floor, through the haze of blood runninginto his eyes, Bill Brent looked up at the two men. He saw that they understood,but he saw the closed faces of men who did not want to understand, did not wantto interfere and hated him for putting them on the spot in the name of justice.He said nothing, rose to his feet and walked out of the building.Mitchum avoided looking at the others. “Hey, you,” he called, jerking his headat the night dispatcher across the room. “Come here. You’ve got to take over atonce.”With the door closed, he repeated to the boy the story of the Diesel atFairmount, as he had given it to Brent, and the order to send the Comet throughwith Engine Number 306, if the boy did not hear from him in half an hour. Theboy was in no condition to think, to speak or to understand anything: he keptseeing the blood on the face of Bill Brent, who had been his idol. “Yes, sir,”he answered numbly.Dave Mitchum departed for Fairmount, announcing to every yard-man, switchman andwiper in sight, as he boarded the track motor car, that he was going in searchof a Diesel for the Comet.The night dispatcher sat at his desk, watching the clock and the telephone,praying that the telephone would ring and let him hear from Mr. Mitchum. But thehalf-hour went by in silence, and when there were only three minutes left, theboy felt a terror he could not explain, except that he did not want to send thatorder.He turned to the trainmaster and the road foreman, asking hesitantly, “Mr.Mitchum gave me an order before he left, but I wonder whether I ought to sendit, because I ... I don’t think it’s right. He said—”The trainmaster turned away; he felt no pity: the boy was about the same age ashis brother had been.The road foreman snapped, “Do just as Mr. Mitchum told you. You’re not supposedto think,” and walked out of the room.The responsibility that James Taggart and Clifton Locey had evaded now rested onthe shoulders of a trembling, bewildered boy. He hesitated, then he buttressedhis courage with the thought that one did not doubt the good faith and thecompetence of railroad executives. He did not know that his vision of a railroadand its executives was that of a century ago.With the conscientious precision of a railroad man, in the moment when the handof the clock ended the half-hour, he signed his name to the order instructingthe Comet to proceed with Engine Number 306, and transmitted the order toWinston Station.The station agent at Winston shuddered when he looked at the order, but he wasnot the man to defy authority. He told himself that the tunnel was not, perhaps,as dangerous as he thought. He told himself that the best policy, these days,was not to think.When he handed their copies of the order to the conductor and the engineer ofthe Comet, the conductor glanced slowly about the room, from face to face,folded the slip of paper, put it into his pocket and walked out without a word.The engineer stood looking at the paper for a moment, then threw it down andsaid, “I’m not going to do it. And if it’s come to where this railroad hands outorders like this one, I’m not going to work for it, either. Just list me ashaving quit.”“But you can’t quit!” cried the station agent. “They’ll arrest you for it!”“If they find me,” said the engineer, and walked out of the station into thevast darkness of the mountain night.The engineer from Silver Springs, who had brought in Number 306, was sitting ina corner of the room. He chuckled and said, “He’s yellow.”The station agent turned to him. “Will you do it, Joe? Will you take the Comet?”Joe Scott was drunk. There had been a time when a railroad man, reporting forduty with any sign of intoxication, would have been regarded as a doctorarriving for work with sores of smallpox on his face. But Joe Scott was aprivileged person. Three months ago, he had been fired for an infraction ofsafety rules, which had caused a major wreck; two weeks ago, he had beenreinstated in his job by order of the Unification Board. He was a friend of FredKinnan; he protected Kinnan’s interests in his union, not against the employers,but against the membership.“Sure,” said Joe Scott. “I’ll take the Comet. I’ll get her through, if I go fastenough.”The fireman of Number 306 had remained in the cab of his engine. He looked upuneasily, when they came to switch his engine to the head end of the Comet; helooked up at the red and green lights of the tunnel, hanging in the distanceabove twenty miles of curves. But he was a placid, amicable fellow, who made agood fireman with no hope of ever rising to engineer; his husky muscles were hisonly asset. He felt certain that his superiors knew what they were doing, so hedid not venture any questions.The conductor stood by the rear end of the Comet. He looked at the lights of thetunnel, then at the long chain of the Comet’s windows. A few windows werelighted, but most of them showed only the feeble blue glow of night lamps edgingthe lowered blinds. He thought that he should rouse the passengers and warnthem. There had been a time when he had placed the safety of the passengersabove his own, not by reason of love for his fellow men, but because thatresponsibility was part of his job, which he accepted and felt pride infulfilling. Now, he felt a contemptuous indifference and no desire to save them.They had asked for and accepted Directive 10-289, he thought, they went onliving and daily turning away in evasion from the kind of verdicts that theUnification Board was passing on defenseless victims—why shouldn’t he now turnaway from them? If he saved their lives, not one of them would come forward todefend him when the Unification Board would convict him for disobeying orders,for creating a panic, for delaying Mr. Chalmers. He had no desire to be a martyrfor the sake of allowing people safely to indulge in their own irresponsibleevil.When the moment came, he raised his lantern and signaled the engineer to start.“See?” said Kip Chalmers triumphantly to Lester Tuck, as the wheels under theirfeet shuddered forward. “Fear is the only practical means to deal with people.”The conductor stepped onto the vestibule of the last car. No one saw him as hewent down the steps of the other side, slipped off the train and vanished intothe darkness of the mountains.A switchman stood ready to throw the switch that would send the Comet from thesiding onto the main track. He looked at the Comet as it came slowly toward him.It was only a blazing white globe with a beam stretching high above his head,and a jerky thunder trembling through the rail under his feet. He knew that theswitch should not be thrown. He thought of the night, ten years ago, when he hadrisked his life in a flood to save a train from a washout. But he knew thattimes had changed. In the moment when he thew the switch and saw the headlightjerk sidewise, he knew that he would now hate his job for the rest of his life.The Comet uncoiled from the siding into a thin, straight line, and went on intothe mountains, with the beam of the headlight like an extended arm pointing theway, and the lighted glass curve of the observation lounge ending it off.Some of the passengers aboard the Comet were awake. As the train started itscoiling ascent, they saw the small cluster of Winston’s lights at the bottom ofthe darkness beyond their windows, then the same darkness, but with red andgreen lights by the hole of a tunnel on the upper edge of the windowpanes. Thelights of Winston kept growing smaller, each time they appeared; the black holeof the tunnel kept growing larger. A black veil went streaking past the windowsat times, dimming the lights: it was the heavy smoke from the coal-burningengine.As the tunnel came closer, they saw, at the edge of the sky far to the south, ina void of space and rock, a spot of living fire twisting in the wind. They didnot know what it was and did not care to learn.It is said that catastrophes are a matter of pure chance, and there were thosewho would have said that the passengers of the Comet were not guilty orresponsible for the thing that happened to them.The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 1, was a professor of sociology who taught thatindividual ability is of no consequence, that individual effort is futile, thatan individual conscience is a useless luxury, that there is no individual mindor character or achievement, that everything is achieved collectively, and thatit’s masses that count, not men.The man in Roomette 7, Car No. 2, was a journalist who wrote that it is properand moral to use compulsion “for a good cause,” who believed that he had theright to unleash physical force upon others—to wreck lives, throttle ambitions,strangle desires, violate convictions, to imprison, to despoil, to murder—forthe sake of whatever he chose to consider as his own idea of “a good cause,”which did not even have to be an idea, since he had never defined what heregarded as the good, but had merely stated that he went by “a feeling”—afeeling unrestrained by any knowledge, since he considered emotion superior toknowledge and relied solely on his own “good intentions” and on the power of agun.The woman in Roomette 10, Car No. 3, was an elderly school teacher who had spenther life turning class after class of helpless children into miserable cowards,by teaching them that the will of the majority is the only standard of good andevil, that a majority may do anything it pleases, that they must not asserttheir own personalities, but must do as others were doing.The man in Drawing Room B, Car No. 4, was a newspaper publisher who believedthat men are evil by nature and unfit for freedom, that their basic interests,if left unchecked, are to lie, to rob and to murder one another—and, therefore,men must be ruled by means of lies, robbery and murder, which must be made theexclusive privilege of the rulers, for the purpose of forcing men to work,teaching them to be moral and keeping them within the bounds of order andjustice.The man in Bedroom H, Car No. 5, was a businessman who had acquired hisbusiness, an ore mine, with the help of a government loan, under theEqualization of Opportunity Bill.The man in Drawing Room A, Car No. 6, was a financier who had made a fortune bybuying “frozen” railroad bonds and getting his friends in Washington to“defreeze” them.The man in Seat 5, Car No. 7, was a worker who believed that he had “a right” toa job, whether his employer wanted him or not.The woman in Roomette 6, Car No. 8, was a lecturer who believed that, as aconsumer, she had “a right” to transportation, whether the railroad peoplewished to provide it or not.The man in Roomette 2, Car No. 9, was a professor of economics who advocated theabolition of private property, explaining that intelligence plays no part inindustrial production, that man’s mind is conditioned by material tools, thatanybody can run a factory or a railroad and it’s only a matter of seizing themachinery.The woman in Bedroom D, Car No. 10, was a mother who had put her two children tosleep in the berth above her, carefully tucking them in, protecting them fromdrafts and jolts; a mother whose husband held a government job enforcingdirectives, which she defended by saying, “I don’t care, it’s only the rich thatthey hurt. After all, I must think of my children.”The man in Roomette 3, Car No. 11, was a sniveling little neurotic who wrotecheap little plays into which, as a social message, he inserted cowardly littleobscenities to the effect that all businessmen were scoundrels.The woman in Roomette 9, Car No. 12, was a housewife who believed that she hadthe right to elect politicians, of whom she knew nothing, to.control giantindustries, of which she had no knowledge.The man in Bedroom F, Car No. 13, was a lawyer who had said, “Me? I’ll find away to get along under any political system.”The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 14, was a professor of philosophy who taught thatthere is no mind—how do you know that the tunnel is dangerous?—no reality—howcan you prove that the tunnel exists?—no logic—why do you claim that trainscannot move without motive power?—no principles—why should you be bound by thelaw of cause-and-effect ?—no rights—why shouldn’t you attach men to their jobsby force?—no morality—what’s moral about running a railroad?—no absolutes—whatdifference does it make to you whether you live or die, anyway? He taught thatwe know nothing—why oppose the orders of your superiors?—that we can never becertain of anything—how do you know you’re right?—that we must act on theexpediency of the moment—you don’t want to risk your job, do you?The man in Drawing Room B, Car No. 15, was an heir who had inherited hisfortune, and who had kept repeating, “Why should Rearden be the only onepermitted to manufacture Rearden Metal?”The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 16, was a humanitarian who had said, “The men ofability? I do not care what or if they are made to suffer. They must bepenalized in order to support the incompetent. Frankly, I do not care whetherthis is just or not. I take pride in not caring to grant any justice to theable, where mercy to the needy is concerned.”These passengers were awake; there was not a man aboard the train who did notshare one or more of their ideas. As the train went into the tunnel, the flameof Wyatt’s Torch was the last thing they saw on earth.027 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_027_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: Here is one more scene from Atlas Shrugged—the very opening ofPart III, set in Atlantis, a capitalist oasis hidden from the world in themountains of Colorado. Dagny, flying alone in Colorado in pursuit of amysterious stranger, has just crash-landed in a deserted meadow."},{"pageContent":"AtlantisWHEN SHE opened her eyes, she saw sunlight, green leaves and a man’s face. Shethought: I know what this is. This was the world as she had expected to see itat sixteen—and now she had reached it—and it seemed so simple, so unastonishing,that the thing she felt was like a blessing pronounced upon the universe bymeans of three words: But of course.She was looking up at the face of a man who knelt by her side, and she knew thatin all the years behind her, this was what she would have given her life to see:a face that bore no mark of pain or fear or guilt. The shape of his mouth waspride, and more: it was as if he took pride in being proud. The angular planesof his cheeks made her think of arrogance, of tension, of scorn—yet the face hadnone of these qualities, it had their final sum: a look of serene determinationand of certainty, and the look of a ruthless innocence which would not seekforgiveness or grant it. It was a face that had nothing to hide or to escape, aface with no fear of being seen or of seeing, so that the first thing shegrasped about him was the intense perceptiveness of his eyes—he looked as if hisfaculty of sight were his best-loved tool and its exercise were a limitless,joyous adventure, as if his eyes imparted a superlative value to himself and tothe world—to himself for his ability to see, to the world for being a place soeagerly worth seeing. It seemed to her for a moment that she was in the presenceof a being who was pure consciousness—yet she had never been so aware of a man’sbody. The light cloth of his shirt seemed to stress, rather than hide, thestructure of his figure, his skin was suntanned, his body had the hardness, thegaunt, tensile strength, the clean precision of a foundry casting, he looked asif he were poured out of metal, but some dimmed, soft-lustered metal, like analuminum-copper alloy, the color of his skin blending with the chestnut-brown ofhis hair, the loose strands of the hair shading from brown to gold in the sun,and his eyes completing the colors, as the one part of the casting left undimmedand hardly lustrous: his eyes were the deep, dark green of light glinting onmetal. He was looking down at her with the faint trace of a smile, it was not alook of discovery, but of familiar contemplation—as if he, too, were seeing thelong-expected and the never-doubted.This was her world, she thought, this was the way men were meant to be and toface their existence—and all the rest of it, all the years of ugliness andstruggle were only someone’s senseless joke. She smiled at him, as at a fellowconspirator, in relief, in deliverance, in radiant mockery of all the things shewould never have to consider important again. He smiled in answer, it was thesame smile as her own, as if he felt what she felt and knew what she meant.“We never had to take any of it seriously, did we?” she whispered.“No, we never had to.”And then, her consciousness returning fully, she realized that this man was atotal stranger.She tried to draw away from him, but it was only a faint movement of her head onthe grass she felt under her hair. She tried to rise. A shot of pain across herback threw her down again.“Don’t move, Miss Taggart. You’re hurt.”“You know me?” Her voice was impersonal and hard.“I’ve known you for many years.”“Have I known you?”“Yes, I think so.”“What is your name?”“John Galt.”She looked at him, not moving.“Why are you frightened?” he asked.“Because I believe it.”028 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_028_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART FOURBasic PhilosophyEDITOR’S NOTE: To create Atlas Shrugged, AR had to go beyond ethics; she had tooriginate a new system of philosophy, identifying the nature of man’s means ofknowledge and of the universe he seeks to know. “Without an understanding andstatement of the right philosophical principle,” she said in a 1946 note toherself, “I cannot create the right story; but the discovery of the principleinterests me only as the discovery of the proper knowledge to be used for mylife purpose ...” (Journals of Ayn Rand, 1997, p. 479).The first selection, from John Galt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged, identifies theaxioms of Objectivism, as against its two opposites: the mystics of spirit andthe mystics of muscle."},{"pageContent":"1. Reason and RealityAXIOMS OF OBJECTIVISM“EXISTENCE EXISTS—and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollaryaxioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessingconsciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.“If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothingto be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious ofnothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itselfas consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claimto perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.“Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two—existence andconsciousness—are axioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducibleprimaries implied in any action you undertake, in any part of your knowledge andin its sum, from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your lifeto the widest erudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shapeof a pebble or the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: thatit exists and that you know it.“To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing ofnon-existence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specificattributes. Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors—thegreatest of your philosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept ofexistence and the rule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You havenever grasped the meaning of,his statement. I am here to complete it: Existenceis Identity, Consciousness is Identification.“Whatever you choose to consider, be it an object, an attribute or an action,the law of identity remains the same. A leaf cannot be a stone at the same time,it cannot be all red and all green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burnat the same time. A is A. Or, if you wish it stated in simpler language: Youcannot have your cake and eat it, too.“Are you seeking to know what is wrong with the world? All the disasters thathave wrecked your world, came from your leaders’ attempt to evade the fact thatA is A. All the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain youhave ever endured, came from your own attempt to evade the fact that A is A. Thepurpose of those who taught you to evade it, was to make you forget that Man isMan.“Man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge, and reason is his only means togain it. Reason is the faculty that perceives, identifies and integrates thematerial provided by his senses. The task of his senses is to give him theevidence of existence, but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason; hissenses tell him only that something is, but what it is must be learned by hismind.“All thinking is a process of identification and integration. Man perceives ablob of color; by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he learnsto identify it as a solid object; he learns to identify the object as a table;he learns that the table is made of wood; he learns that the wood consists ofcells, that the cells consist of molecules, that the molecules consist of atoms.All through this process, the work of his mind consists of answers to a singlequestion: What is it? His means to establish the truth of his answers is logic,and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art ofnon-contradictory identification. A contradiction cannot exist. An atom isitself, and so is the universe; neither can contradict its own identity; nor cana part contradict the whole. No concept man forms is valid unless he integratesit without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge. To arrive at acontradiction is to confess an error in one’s thinking: to maintain acontradiction is to abdicate one’s mind and to evict oneself from the realm ofreality.“Reality is that which exists; the unreal does not exist; the unreal is merelythat negation of existence which is the content of a human consciousness when itattempts to abandon reason. Truth is the recognition of reality; reason, man’sonly means of knowledge, is his only standard of truth.“The most depraved sentence you can now utter is to ask: Whose reason? Theanswer is: Yours. No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest, it is yourown mind that has to acquire it. It is only with your own knowledge that you candeal. It is only your own knowledge that you can claim to possess or ask othersto consider. Your mind is your only judge of truth—and if others dissent fromyour verdict, reality is the court of final appeal. Nothing but a man’s mind canperform that complex, delicate, crucial process of identification which isthinking. Nothing can direct the process but his own judgment. Nothing candirect his judgment but his moral integrity.“You who speak of a ‘moral instinct’ as if it were some separate endowmentopposed to reason—man’s reason is his moral faculty. A process of reason is aprocess of constant choice in answer to the question: True or False?—Right orWrong? Is a seed to be planted in soil in order to grow—right or wrong? Is aman’s wound to be disinfected in order to save his life—right or wrong? Does thenature of atmospheric electricity permit it to be converted into kineticpower—right or wrong? It is the answers to such questions that gave youeverything you have—and the answers came from a man’s mind, a mind ofintransigent devotion to that which is right.“A rational process is a moral process. You may make an error at any step of it,with nothing to protect you but your own severity, or you may try to cheat, tofake the evidence and evade the effort of the quest—but if devotion to truth isthe hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form ofdevotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.“That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, and that whichyou call ‘free will’ is your mind’s freedom to think or not, the only will youhave, your only freedom, the choice that controls all the choices you make anddetermines your life and your character.“Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And hisbasic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of youpractice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willfulsuspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think—not blindness, but therefusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act ofunfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility ofjudgment—on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuseto identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict‘It is.’ Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, anattempt to wipe out reality. But existence exists; reality is not to be wipedout, it will merely wipe out the wiper. By refusing to say ‘It is,’ you arerefusing to say ‘I am.’ By suspending your judgment, you are negating yourperson. When a man declares: ‘Who am I to know?’—he is declaring: ‘Who am I tolive?’“This, in every hour and every issue, is your basic moral choice: thinking ornon-thinking, existence or non-existence, A or non-A, entity or zero. [...] “ ‘We know that we know nothing,’ they [skeptics] chatter, blanking out the factthat they are claiming knowledge—‘There are not absolutes,’ they chatter,blanking out the fact that they are uttering an absolute—‘You cannot prove thatyou exist or that you’re conscious,’ they chatter, blanking out the fact thatproof presupposes existence, consciousness and a complex chain of knowledge: theexistence of something to know, of a consciousness able to know it, and of aknowledge that has learned to distinguish between such concepts as the provedand the unproved.“When a savage who has not learned to speak declares that existence must beproved, he is asking you to prove it by means of non-existence—when he declaresthat your consciousness must be proved, he is asking you to prove it by means ofunconsciousness—he is asking you to step into a void outside of existence andconsciousness to give him proof of both—he is asking you to become a zerogaining knowledge about a zero.“When he declares that an axiom is a matter of arbitrary choice and he doesn’tchoose to accept the axiom that he exists, he blanks out the fact that he hasaccepted it by uttering that sentence, that the only way to reject it is to shutone’s mouth, expound no theories and die.“An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of anyfurther statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarilycontained in all others, whether any particular speaker chooses to identify itor not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact thatthey have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it. Letthe caveman who does not choose to accept the axiom of identity, try to presenthis theory without using the concept of identity or any concept derived fromit—let the anthropoid who does not choose to accept the existence of nouns, tryto devise a language without nouns; adjectives or verbs—iet the witch-doctor whodoes not choose to accept the validity of sensory perception, try to prove itwithout using the data he obtained by sensory perception—let the head-hunter whodoes not choose to accept the validity of logic, try to prove it without usinglogic—let the pigmy who proclaims that a skyscraper needs no foundation after itreaches its fiftieth story, yank the base from under his building, not yours—letthe cannibal who snarls that the freedom of man’s mind was needed to create anindustrial civilization, but is not needed to maintain it, be given an arrowheadand bearskin, not a university chair of economics.“Do you think they are taking you back to dark ages? They are taking you back todarker ages than any your history has known. Their goal is not the era ofpre-science, but the era of pre-language. Their purpose is to deprive you of theconcept on which man’s mind, his life and his culture depend: the concept of anobjective reality. Identify the development of a human consciousness—and youwill know the purpose of their creed.“A savage is a being who has not grasped that A is A and that reality is real.He has arrested his mind at the level of a baby’s, at the state when aconsciousness acquires its initial sensory perception and has not learned todistinguish solid objects. It is to a baby that the world appears as a blur ofmotion, without things that move—and the birth of his mind is the day when hegrasps that the streak that keeps flickering past him is his mother and thewhirl beyond her is a curtain, that the two are solid entities and neither canturn into the other, that they are what they are, that they exist. The day whenhe grasps that matter has no volition is the day when he grasps that he has—andthis is his birth as a human being. The day when he grasps that the reflectionhe sees in a mirror is not a delusion, that it is real, but it is not himself,that the mirage he sees in a desert is not a delusion, that the air and thelight rays that cause it are real, but it is not a city, it is a city’sreflection—the day when he grasps that he is not a passive recipient of thesensations of any given moment, that his senses do not provide him withautomatic knowledge in separate snatches independent of context, but only withthe material of knowledge, which his mind must learn to integrate—the day whenhe grasps that his senses cannot deceive him, that physical objects cannot actwithout causes, that his organs of perception are physical and have no volition,no power to invent or to distort, that the evidence they give him is anabsolute, but his mind must learn to understand it, his mind must discover thenature, the causes, the full context of his sensory material, his mind mustidentify the things that he perceives—that is the day of his birth as a thinkerand scientist.“We are the men who reach that day; you are the men who choose to reach itpartly; a savage is a man who never does.“To a savage, the world is a place of unintelligible miracles where anything ispossible to inanimate matter and nothing is possible to him. His world is notthe unknown, but that irrational horror: the unknowable. He believes thatphysical objects are endowed with a mysterious volition, moved by causeless,unpredictable whims, while he is a helpless pawn at the mercy of forces beyondhis control. He believes that nature is ruled by demons who possess anomnipotent power and that reality is their fluid plaything, where they can turnhis bowl of meal into a snake and his wife into a beetle at any moment, wherethe A he has never discovered can be any non-A they choose, where the onlyknowledge he possesses is that he must not attempt to know. He can count onnothing, he can only wish, and he spends his life on wishing, on begging hisdemons to grant him his wishes by the arbitrary power of their will, giving themcredit when they do, taking the blame when they don’t, offering them sacrificesin token of his gratitude and sacrifices in token of his guilt, crawling on hisbelly in fear and worship of sun and moon and wind and rain and of any thug whoannounces himself as their spokesman, provided his words are unintelligible andhis mask sufficiently frightening—he wishes, begs and crawls, and dies, leavingyou, as a record of his view of existence, the distorted monstrosities of hisidols, part-man, part-animal, part-spider, the embodiments of the world ofnon-A.“His is the intellectual state of your modern teachers and his is the world towhich they want to bring you.“If you wonder by what means they propose to do it, walk into any collegeclassroom and you will hear your professors teaching your children that man canbe certain of nothing, that his consciousness has no validity whatever, that hecan learn no facts and no laws of existence, that he’s incapable of knowing anobjective reality. What, then, is his standard of knowledge and truth? Whateverothers believe, is their answer. There is no knowledge, they teach, there’s onlyfaith: your belief that you exist is an act of faith, no more valid thananother’s faith in his right to kill you; the axioms of science are an act offaith, no more valid than a mystic’s faith in revelations; the belief thatelectric light can be produced by a generator is an act of faith, no more validthan the belief that it can be produced by a rabbit’s foot kissed under astepladder on the first of the moon—truth is whatever people want it to be, andpeople are everyone except yourself; reality is whatever people choose to say itis, there are no objective facts, there are only people’s arbitrary wishes—a manwho seeks knowledge in a laboratory by means of test tubes and logic is anold-fashioned, superstitious fool; a true scientist is a man who goes aroundtaking public polls—and if it weren’t for the selfish greed of the manufacturersof steel girders, who have a vested interest in obstructing the progress ofscience, you would learn that New York City does not exist, because a poll ofthe entire population of the world would tell you by a landslide majority thattheir beliefs forbid its existence.“For centuries, the mystics of spirit have proclaimed that faith is superior toreason, but have not dared deny the existence of reason. Their heirs andproduct, the mystics of muscle, have completed their job and achieved theirdream: they proclaim that everything is faith, and call it a revolt againstbelieving. As revolt against unproved assertions, they proclaim that nothing canbe proved; as revolt against supernatural knowledge, they proclaim that noknowledge is possible; as revolt against the enemies of science, they proclaimthat science is superstition; as revolt against the enslavement of the mind,they proclaim that there is no mind.“If you surrender your power to perceive, if you accept the switch of yourstandard from the objective to the collective and wait for mankind to tell youwhat to think, you will find another switch taking place before the eyes youhave renounced: you will find that your teachers become the rulers of thecollective, and if you then refuse to obey them, protesting that they are notthe whole of mankind, they will answer: ‘By what means do you know that we arenot? Are, brother? Where did you get that old-fashioned term?’“If you doubt that such is their purpose, observe with what passionateconsistency the mystics of muscle are striving to make you forget that a conceptsuch as ‘Mind’ has ever existed. Observe the twists of undefined verbiage, thewords with rubber meanings, the terms left floating in midstream, by means ofwhich they try to get around the recognition of the concept of ‘thinking.’ Yourconsciousness, they tell you, consists of ‘reflexes,’ ‘reactions,’‘experiences,’ ‘urges,’ and ‘drives’—and refuse to identify the means by whichthey acquired that knowledge, to identify the act they are performing when theytell it or the act you are performing when you listen. Words have the power to‘condition’ you, they say and refuse to identify the reason why words have thepower to change your-blank-out. A student reading a book understands it througha process of-blank-out. A scientist working on an invention is engaged in theactivity of—blank-out.

A factory is a ‘naturalresource,’ like a tree, a rock or a mud puddle....029 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_029_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: AR’s view of reason and of its fundamental role in man’s life areindicated in the following excerpt, taken from an introductory talk given atYale in 1960. The complete talk is published in Philosophy: Who Needs It.FAITH AND FORCE: THE DESTROYERS OF THE MODERN WORLD... Now THERE is one word—a single word—which can blast the morality of altruismout of existence and which it cannot withstand—the word: “Why?” Why must manlive for the sake of others? Why must he be a sacrificial animal? Why is thatthe good? There is no earthly reason for it—and, ladies and gentlemen, in thewhole history of philosophy no earthly reason has ever been given.It is only mysticism that can permit moralists to get away with it. It wasmysticism, the unearthly, the supernatural, the irrational that has always beencalled upon to justify it—or, to be exact, to escape the necessity ofjustification. One does not justify the irrational, one just takes it on faith.What most moralists—and few of their victims—realize is that reason and altruismare incompatible. And this is the basic contradiction of Western civilization:reason versus altruism. This is the conflict that had to explode sooner orlater.The real conflict, of course, is reason versus mysticism. But if it weren’t forthe altruist morality, mysticism would have died when it did die—at theRenaissance—leaving no vampire to haunt Western culture. A “vampire” is supposedto be a dead creature that comes out of its grave only at night—onty in thedarkness—and drains the blood of the living. The description applied toaltruism, is exact.Western civilization was the child and product of reason—via ancient Greece. Inall other civilizations, reason has always been the menial servant—thehandmaiden—of mysticism. You may observe the results. It is only Western culturethat has ever been dominated—imperfectly, incompletely, precariously and at rareintervals—but still, dominated by reason. You may observe the results of that.The conflict of reason versus mysticism is the issue of life or death—of freedomor slavery—of progress or stagnant brutality. Or, to put it another way, it isthe conflict of consciousness versus unconsciousness.Let us define our terms. What is reason? Reason is the faculty which perceives,identifies and integrates the material provided by man’s senses. Reasonintegrates man’s perceptions by means of forming abstractions or conceptions,thus raising man’s knowledge from the perceptual level, which he shares withanimals, to the conceptual level, which he alone can reach. The method whichreason employs in this process is logic—and logic is the art ofnon-contradictory identification.What is mysticism? Mysticism is the acceptance of allegations without evidenceor proof, either apart from or against the evidence of one’s senses and one’sreason. Mysticism is the claim to some non-sensory, non-rational, non-definable,non-identifiable means of knowledge, such as “instinct,” “intuition,”“revelation,” or any form of “just knowing.”Reason is the perception of reality, and rests on a single axiom: the Law ofIdentity.Mysticism is the claim to the perception of some other reality—other than theone in which we live—whose definition is only that it is not natural, it issupernatural, and is to be perceived by some form of unnatural or supernaturalmeans.You realize, of course, that epistemology—the theory of knowledge—is the mostcomplex branch of philosophy, which cannot be covered exhaustively in a singlelecture. So I will not attempt to cover it. I will say only that those who wisha fuller discussion will find it in Atlas Shrugged. For the purposes oftonight’s discussion, the definitions I have given you contain the essence ofthe issue, regardless of whose theory, argument or philosophy you choose toaccept.I will repeat: Reason is the faculty which perceives, identifies and integratesthe material provided by man’s senses. Mysticism is the claim to a non-sensorymeans of knowledge.In Western civilization, the period ruled by mysticism is known as the Dark Agesand the Middle Ages. I will assume that you know the nature of that period andthe state of human existence in those ages. The Renaissance broke the rule ofthe mystics. “Renaissance” means “rebirth.” Few people today will care to remindyou that it was a rebirth of reason—of man’s mind.In the light of what followed—most particularly, in the light of the industrialrevolution—nobody can now take faith, or religion, or revelation, or any form ofmysticism as his basic and exclusive guide to existence, not in the way it wastaken in the Middle Ages. This does not mean that the Renaissance hasautomatically converted everybody to rationality; far from it. It means onlythat so long as a single automobile, a single skyscraper or a single copy ofAristotle’s Logic remains in existence, nobody will be able to arouse men’shope, eagerness and joyous enthusiasm by telling them to ditch their mind andrely on mystic faith. This is why I said that mysticism, as a cultural power, isdead. Observe that in the attempts at a mystic revival today, it is not anappeal to life, hope and joy that the mystics are making, but an appeal to fear,doom and despair. “Give up, your mind is impotent; life is only a foxhole,” isnot a motto that can revive a culture.Now, if you ask me to name the man most responsible for the present state of theworld, the man whose influence has almost succeeded in destroying theachievements of the Renaissance—I will name Immanuel Kant. He was thephilosopher who saved the morality of altruism, and who knew that what it had tobe saved from was—reason.This is not a mere hypothesis. It is a known historical fact that Kant’sinterest and purpose in philosophy was to save the morality of altruism, whichcould not survive without a mystic base. His metaphysics and his epistemologywere devised for that purpose. He did not, of course, announce himself as amystic—few of them have, since the Renaissance. He announced himself as achampion of reason—of “pure” reason.There are two ways to destroy the power of a concept: one, by an open attack inopen discussion—the other, by subversion, from the inside; that is: bysubverting the meaning of the concept, setting up a straw man and then refutingit. Kant did the second. He did not attack reason—he merely constructed such aversion of what is reason that it made mysticism look like plain, rationalcommon sense by comparison. He did not deny the validity of reason—he merelyclaimed that reason is “limited,” that it leads us to impossible contradictions,that everything we perceive is an illusion and that we can never perceivereality or “things as they are.” He claimed, in effect, that the things weperceive are not real, because we perceive them.A “straw man” is an odd metaphor to apply to such an enormous, cumbersome,ponderous construction as Kant’s system of epistemology. Nevertheless, a strawman is what it was—and the doubts, the uncertainty, the skepticism thatfollowed, skepticism about man’s ability ever to know anything, were not, infact, applicable to human consciousness, because it was not a humanconsciousness that Kant’s robot represented. But philosophers accepted it assuch. And while they cried that reason had been invalidated, they did not noticethat reason had been pushed off the philosophical scene altogether and that thefaculty they were arguing about was not reason.No, Kant did not destroy reason; he merely did as thorough a job of undercuttingas anyone could ever do.If you trace the roots of all our current philosophies—such as Pragmatism,Logical Positivism, and all the rest of the neomystics who announce happily thatyou cannot prove that you exist—you will find that they all grew out of Kant.As to Kant’s version of the altruist morality, he claimed that it was derivedfrom “pure reason,” not from revelation—except that it rested on a specialinstinct for duty, a “categorical imperative” which one “just knows.” Hisversion of morality makes the Christian one sound like a healthy, cheerful,benevolent code of selfishness. Christianity merely told man to love hisneighbor as himself; that’s not exactly rational—but at least it does not forbidman to love himself. What Kant propounded was full, total, abject selflessness:he held that an action is moral only if you perform it out of a sense of dutyand derive no benefit from it of any kind, neither material nor spiritual; ifyou derive any benefit, your action is not moral any longer. This is theultimate form of demanding that man turn himself into a “shmoo”—the mysticlittle animal of the Li’l Abner comic strip, that went around seeking to beeaten by somebody.It is Kant’s version of altruism that is generally accepted today, notpracticed—who can practice it?—but guiltily accepted. It is Kant’s version ofaltruism that people, who have never heard of Kant, profess when they equateself-interest with evil. It is Kant’s version of altruism that’s workingwhenever people are afraid to admit the pursuit of any personal pleasure or gainor motive—whenever men are afraid to confess that they are seeking their ownhappiness—whenever businessmen are afraid to say that they are makingprofits—whenever the victims of an advancing dictatorship are afraid to asserttheir “selfish” rights.The ultimate monument to Kant and to the whole altruist morality is SovietRussia.If you want to prove to yourself the power of ideas and, particularly, ofmorality—the intellectual history of the nineteenth century would be a goodexample to study. The greatest, unprecedented, un-dreamed of events andachievements were taking place before men’s eyes—but men did not see them anddid not understand their meaning, as they do not understand it to this day. I amspeaking of the industrial revolution, of the United States and of capitalism.For the first time in history, men gained control over physical nature and threwoff the control of men over men—that is: men discovered science and politicalfreedom. The creative energy, the abundance, the wealth, the rising standard ofliving for every level of the population were such that the nineteenth centurylooks like a fiction-Utopia, like a blinding burst of sunlight, in the drabprogression of most of human history. If life on earth is one’s standard ofvalue, then the nineteenth century moved mankind forward more than all the othercenturies combined.Did anyone appreciate it? Does anyone appreciate it now? Has anyone identifiedthe causes of that historical miracle?They did not and have not. What blinded them? The morality of altruism.Let me explain this. There are, fundamentally, only two causes of the progressof the nineteenth century—the same two causes which you will find at the root ofany happy, benevolent, progressive era in human history. One cause ispsychological, the other existential—or: one pertains to man’s consciousness,the other to the physical conditions of his existence. The first is reason, thesecond is freedom. And when I say “freedom,” I do not mean poetic sloppiness,such as “freedom from want” or “freedom from fear” or “freedom from thenecessity of earning a living.” I mean “freedom from compulson —freedom fromrule by physical force.” Which means: political freedom.These two—reason and freedom—are corollaries, and their relationship isreciprocal: when men are rational, freedom wins; when men are free, reason wins.Their antagonists are: faith and force. These, also, are corollaries: everyperiod of history dominated by mysticism, was a period of statism, ofdictatorship, of tryanny. Look at the Middle Ages—and look at the politicalsystems of today.The nineteenth century was the ultimate product and expression of theintellectual trend of the Renaissance and the Age of Reason, which means: of apredominantly Aristotelian philosophy And, for the first time in history, itcreated a new economic system, the necessary corollary of political freedom, asystem of free trade on a free market: capitalism.No, it was not a full, perfect, unregulated, totally laissez-faire capitalism—asit should have been. Various degrees of government interference and controlstill remained, even in America—and this is what led to the eventual destructionof capitalism. But the extent to which certain countries were free was the exactextent of their economic progress. America, the freest, achieved the most.Never mind the low wages and the harsh living conditions of the early years ofcapitalism. They were all that the national economies of the time could afford.Capitalism did not create poverty—it inherited it. Compared to the centuries ofprecapitalist starvation, the living conditions of the poor in the early yearsof capitalism were the first chance the poor had ever had to survive. Asproof—the enormous growth of the European population during the nineteenthcentury, a growth of over 300 percent, as compared to the previous growth ofsomething like 3 percent per century. [...] I have said that faith and force are corollaries, and that mysticism will alwayslead to the rule of brutality. The cause of it is contained in the very natureof mysticism. Reason is the only objective means of communication and ofunderstanding among men; when men deal with one another by means of reason,reality is their objective standard and frame of reference. But when men claimto possess supernatural means of knowledge, no persuasion, communication orunderstanding are possible. Why do we kill wild animals in the jungle? Becauseno other way of dealing with them is open to us. And that is the state to whichmysticism reduces mankind—a state where, in case of disagreement, men have norecourse except to physical violence. And more: no man or mystical elite canhold a whole society subjugated to their arbitrary assertions, edicts and whims,without the use of force. Anyone who resorts to the formula: “It’s so, because Isay so,” will have to reach for a gun, sooner or later. Communists, like allmaterialists, are neo-mystics: it does not matter whether one rejects the mindin favor of revelations or in favor of conditioned reflexes. The basic premiseand the results are the same.Such is the nature of the evil which modem intellectuals have helped to letloose in the world—and such is the nature of their guilt.Now take a look at the state of the world. The signs and symptoms of the DarkAges are rising again all over the earth. Slave labor, executions without trial,torture chambers, concentration camps, mass slaughter—all the things which thecapitalism of the nineteenth century had abolished in the civilized world, arenow brought back by the rule of the neo-mystics.Look at the state of our intellectual life. In philosophy, the climax of theKantian version of reason has brought us to the point where allegedphilosophers, forgetting the existence of dictionaries and grammar primers, runaround studying such questions as: “What do we mean when we say ‘The cat is onthe mat’?”—while other philosophers proclaim that nouns are an illusion, butsuch terms as “if-then,” “but” and “or” have profound philosophicalsignificance—while still others toy with the idea of an “index of prohibitedwords” and desire to place on it such words as—Iquote—“entity—essence—mind—matter—reality—thing.”In psychology, one school holds that man, by nature, is a helpless,guilt-ridden, instinct-driven automaton—while another school objects that thisis not true, because there is no scientific evidence to prove that man isconscious.In literature, man is presented as a mindless cripple, inhabiting garbage cans.In art, people announce that they do not paint objects, they paint emotions. Inyouth movements—if that’s what it can be called—young men attract attention byopenly announcing that they are “beat.”The spirit of it all, both the cause of it and the final climax, is contained ina quotation which I am going to read to you. I will preface it by saying that inAtlas Shrugged I stated that the world is being destroyed by mysticism andaltruism, which are anti-man, anti-mind and anti-life. You have undoubtedlyheard me being accused of exaggeration. I shall now read to you an excerpt fromthe paper of a professor, published by an alumni faculty seminar of a prominentuniversity.“Perhaps in the future reason will cease to be important. Perhaps for guidancein time of trouble, people will turn not to human thought, but to the humancapacity for suffering. Not the universities with their thinkers, but the placesand people in distress, the inmates of asylums and concentration camps, thehelpless decision makers in bureaucracy and the helpless soldiers infoxholes—these will be the ones to lighten man’s way, to refashion his knowledgeof disaster into something creative. We may be entering a new age. Our heroesmay not be intellectual giants like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein, but victimslike Anne Frank, who will show us a greater miracle than thought. They willteach us how to endure—how to create good in the midst of evil and how tonurture love in the presence of death. Should this happen, however, theuniversity will still have its place. Even the intellectual man can be anexample of creative suffering.”Observe that we are not to question “the helpless decision makers inbureaucracy”—we are not to discover that they are the cause of the concentrationcamps, of the foxholes and of victims like Anne Frank—we are not to help suchvictims, we are merely to feel suffering and to learn to suffer some more—wecan’t help it, the helpless bureaucrats can’t help it, nobody can help it—theinmates of asylums will guide us, not intellectual giants—suffering is thesupreme value, not reason.This, ladies and gentlemen, is cultural bankruptcy.Since “challenge” is your slogan, I will say that if you are looking for achallenge, you are facing the greatest one in history. A moral revolution is themost difficult, the most demanding, the most radical form of rebellion, but thatis the task to be done today, if you choose to accept it. When I say “radical,”I mean it in its literal and reputable sense: fundamental. Civilization does nothave to perish. The brutes are winning only by default. But in order to fightthem to the finish and with full rectitude, it is the altruist morality that youhave to reject....030 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_030_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"2. Mind and Body Contrary to Plato and Kant, AR’s view of reason is emphatically nototherworldly. Her heroes are men of thought—and of action based on it. They aredryly logical—and intensely passionate; idealistic and practical. In short, theyrepresent the harmony or integration of mind and body. This contradicts andnullifies the age-old belief in a soul-body dichotomy. It denies both“spiritualism” and “materialism.”This excerpt, from the essay “For the New Intellectual,” identifies theinfluence of the mind-body dichotomy throughout history—and the rationalalternative to such an approach. (Attila represents the materialist; the WitchDoctor, the spiritualist; the Producer, the union of mind and body.)ATTILA AND THE WITCH DOCTOR... HISTORICALLY, THE professional intellectual is a very recent phenomenon: hedates only from the industrial revolution. There are no professionalintellectuals in primitive, savage societies, there are only witch doctors.There were no professional intellectuals in the Middle Ages, there were onlymonks in monasteries. In the post-Renaissance era, prior to the birth ofcapitalism, the men of the intellect—the philosophers, the teachers, thewriters, the early scientists—were men without a profession, that is: without asocially recognized position, without a market, without a means of earning alivelihood. Intellectual pursuits had to depend on the accident of inheritedwealth or on the favor and financial support of some wealthy protector. Andwealth was not earned on an open market, either; wealth was acquired byconquest, by force, by political power, or by the favor of those who heldpolitical power. Tradesmen were more vulnerably and precariously dependent onfavor than the intellectuals.The professional businessman and the professional intellectual came intoexistence together, as brothers born of the industrial revolution. Both are thesons of capitalism—and if they perish, they will perish together. The tragicirony will be that they will have destroyed each other; and the major share ofthe guilt will belong to the intellectual.With very rare and brief exceptions, pre-capitalist societies had no place forthe creative power of man’s mind, neither in the creation of ideas nor in thecreation of wealth. Reason and its practical expression—free trade—wereforbidden as a sin and a crime, or were tolerated, usually as ignobleactivities, under the control of authorities who could revoke the tolerance atwhim. Such societies were ruled by faith and its practical expression: force.There were no makers of knowledge and no makers of wealth; there were only witchdoctors and tribal chiefs. These two figures dominate every anti-rational periodof history, whether one calls them tribal chief and witch doctor—or absolutemonarch and religious leader—or dictator and logical positivist.“The tragic joke of human history”—I am quoting John Gait in Atlas Shrugged—“isthat on any of the altars men erected, it was always man whom they immolated andthe animal whom they enshrined. It was always the animal’s attributes, notman’s, that humanity worshipped: the idol of instinct and the idol of force—themystics and the kings—the mystics, who longed for an irresponsible consciousnessand ruled by means of the claim that their dark emotions were superior toreason, that knowledge came in blind, causeless fits, blindly to be followed,not doubted—and the kings, who ruled by means of claws and muscles, withconquest as their method and looting as their aim, with a club or a gun as solesanction of their power. The defenders of man’s soul were concerned with hisfeelings, and the defenders of man’s body were concerned with his stomach—butboth were united against his mind.”These two figures—the man of faith and the man of force—are philosophicalarchetypes, psychological symbols and historical reality. As philosophicalarchetypes, they embody two variants of a certain view of man and of existence.As psychological symbols, they represent the basic motivation of a great manymen who exist in any era, culture or society. As historical reality, they arethe actual rulers of most of mankind’s societies, who rise to power whenever menabandon reason.The essential characteristics of these two remain the same in all ages: Attila,the man who rules by brute force, acts on the range of the moment, is concernedwith nothing but the physical reality immediately before him, respects nothingbut man’s muscles, and regards a fist, a club or a gun as the only answer to anyproblem—and the Witch Doctor, the man who dreads physical reality, dreads thenecessity of practical action, and escapes into his emotions, into visions ofsome mystic realm where his wishes enjoy a supernatural power unlimited by theabsolute of nature.Superficially, these two may appear to be opposites, but observe what they havein common: a consciousness held down to the perceptual method of functioning, anawareness that does not choose to extend beyond the automatic, the immediate,the given, the involuntary, which means: an animal’s “epistemology” or as nearto it as a human consciousness can come.Man’s consciousness shares with animals the first two stages of its development:sensations and perceptions; but it is the third state, conceptions, that makeshim man. Sensations are integrated into perceptions automatically, by the brainof a man or of an animal. But to integrate perceptions into conceptions by aprocess of abstraction, is a feat that man alone has the power to perform—and hehas to perform it by choice. The process of abstraction, and ofconcept-formation is a process of reason, of thought; it is not automatic norinstinctive nor involuntary nor infallible. Man has to initiate it, to sustainit and to bear responsibility for its results. The pre-conceptual level ofconsciousness is nonvolitional; volition begins with the first syllogism. Manhas the choice to think or to evade—to maintain a state of full awareness or todrift from moment to moment, in a semiconscious daze, at the mercy of whateverassociational whims the unfocused mechanism of his consciousness produces.But the living organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness need toexercise it in order to survive. An animal’s consciousness functionsautomatically; an animal perceives what it is able to perceive and survivesaccordingly, no further than the perceptual level permits and no better. Mancannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses do notprovide him with an automatic guidance, they do not give him the knowledge heneeds, only the material of knowledge, which his mind has to integrate. Man isthe only living species who has to perceive reality—which means: to be conscious—by choice. But he shares with other species the penalty of unconsciousness:destruction. For an animal, the question of survival is primarily physical; forman, primarily epistemological.Man’s unique reward, however, is that while animals survive by adjustingthemselves to their background, man survives by adjusting his background tohimself. If a drought strikes them, animals perish—man builds irrigation canals;if a flood strikes them, animals perish—man builds dams; if a carnivorous packattacks them animals perish—man writes the Constitution of the United States.But one does not obtain food, safety or freedom—by instinct.It is against this faculty, the faculty of reason, that Attila and the WitchDoctor rebel. The key to both their souls is their longing for the effortless,irresponsible, automatic consciousness of an animal. Both dread the necessity,the risk and the responsibility of rational cognition. Both dread the fact that“nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.” Both seek to exist, not by conqueringnature, but by adjusting to the given, the immediate, the known. There is onlyone means of survival for those who do not choose to conquer nature: to conquerthose who do.The physical conquest of men is Attila’s method of survival. He regards men asothers regard fruit trees or farm animals: as objects in nature, his for theseizing. But while a good farmer knows, at least, that fruit trees and animalshave a specific nature and require a specific kind of handling, the perceptualmentality of Attila does not extend to so abstract a level: men, to him, are anatural phenomenon and an irreducible primary, as all natural phenomena areirreducible primaries to an animal. Attila feels no need to understand, toexplain, nor even to wonder, how men manage to produce the things hecovets—“somehow” is a fully satisfactory answer inside his skull, which refusesto consider such questions as “how?” and “why?” or such concepts as identity andcausality. All he needs, his “urges” tell him, is bigger muscles, bigger clubsor a bigger gang than theirs in order to seize their bodies and their products,after which their bodies will obey his commands and will provide him, somehow,with the satisfaction of any whim. He approaches men as a beast of prey, and theconsequences of his actions or the possibility of exhausting his victims neverenters his consciousness, which does not choose to extend beyond the givenmoment. His view of the universe does not include the power of production. Thepower of destruction, of brute force, is, to him, metaphysically omnipotent.An Attila never thinks of creating, only of taking over. Whether he conquers aneighboring tribe or overruns a continent, material looting is his only goal andit ends with the act of seizure: he has no other purpose, no plan, no system toimpose on the conquered, no values. His pleasures are closer to the level ofsensations than of perceptions: food, drink, palatial shelter, rich clothing,indiscriminate sex, contests of physical prowess, gambling—all those activitieswhich do not demand or involve the use of the conceptual level of consciousness.He does not originate his pleasures: he desires and pursues whatever thosearound him seem to find desirable. Even in the realm of desires, he does notcreate, he merely takes over.But a human being cannot live his life moment by moment; a human consciousnesspreserves a certain continuity and demands a certain degree of integration,whether a man seeks it or not. A human being needs a frame of reference, acomprehensive view of existence, no matter how rudimentary, and, since hisconsciousness is volitional, a sense of being right, a moral justification ofhis actions, which means: a philosophical code of values. Who, then, providesAttila with values? The Witch Doctor.If Attila’s method of survival is the conquest of those who conquer nature, theWitch Doctor’s method of survival is safer, he believes, and spares him therisks of physical conflict. His method is the conquest of those who conquerthose who conquer nature. It is not men’s bodies that he seeks to rule, butmen’s souls.To Attila, as to an animal, the phenomena of nature are an irreducible primary.To the Witch Doctor, as to an animal, the irreducible primary is the automaticphenomena of his own consciousness.An animal has no critical faculty; he has no control over the function of hisbrain and no power to question its content. To an animal, whatever strikes hisawareness is an absolute that corresponds to reality—or rather, it is adistinction he is incapable of making: reality, to him, is whatever he senses orfeels. And this is the Witch Doctor’s epistemological ideal, the mode ofconsciousness he strives to induce in himself. To the Witch Doctor, emotions aretools of cognition, and wishes take precedence over facts. He seeks to escapethe risks of a quest for knowledge by obliterating the distinction betweenconsciousness and reality, between the perceiver and the perceived, hoping thatan automatic certainty and an infallible knowledge of the universe will begranted to him by the blind, unfocused stare of his eyes turned inward,contemplating the sensations, the feelings, the urgings, the muggy associationaltwistings projected by the rudderless mechanism of his undirected consciousness.Whatever his mechanism produces is an absolute not to be questioned; andwhenever it clashes with reality, it is reality that he ignores.Since the clash is constant, the Witch Doctor’s solution is to believe that whathe perceives is another, “higher” reality—where his wishes are omnipotent, wherecontradictions are possible and A is non-A, where his assertions, which arefalse on earth, become true and acquire the status of a “superior” truth whichhe perceives by means of a special faculty denied to other, “inferior,” beings.The only validation of his consciousness he can obtain on earth is the beliefand the obedience of others, when they accept his “truth” as superior to theirown perception of reality. While Attila extorts their obedience by means of aclub, the Witch Doctor obtains it by means of a much more powerful weapon: hepre-empts the field of morality.There is no way to turn morality into a weapon of enslavement except bydivorcing it from man’s reason and from the goals of his own existence. There isno way to degrade man’s life on earth except by the lethal opposition of themoral and the practical. Morality is a code of values to guide man’s choices andactions; when it is set to oppose his own life and mind, it makes him turnagainst himself and blindly act as the tool of his own destruction. There is noway to make a human being accept the role of a sacrificial animal except bydestroying his self-esteem. There is no way to destroy his self-esteem except bymaking him reject his own consciousness. There is no way to make him reject hisown consciousness except by convincing him of its impotence.The damnation of this earth as a realm where nothing is possible to man butpain, disaster and defeat, a realm inferior to another, “higher,” reality; thedamnation of all values, enjoyment, achievement and success on earth as a proofof depravity; the damnation of man’s mind as a source of pride, and thedamnation of reason as a “limited,” deceptive, unreliable, impotent faculty,incapable of perceiving the “real” reality and the “true” truth; the split ofman in two, setting his consciousness (his soul) against his body, and his moralvalues against his own interest; the damnation of man’s nature, body and self asevil; the commandment of self-sacrifice, renunciation, suffering, obedience,humility and faith, as the good; the damnation of life and the worship of death,with the promise of rewards beyond the grave—these are the necessary tenets ofthe Witch Doctor’s view of existence, as they have been in every variant ofWitch Doctor philosophy throughout the course of mankind’s history.The secret of the Witch Doctor’s power lies in the fact that man needs anintegrated view of life, a philosophy, whether he is aware of his need ornot—and whenever, through ignorance, cowardice or mental sloth, men choose notto be aware of it, their chronic sense of guilt, uncertainty and terror makesthem feel that the Witch Doctor’s philosophy is true.The first to feel it is Attila.The man who lives by brute force, at the whim and mercy of the moment, lives ona narrow island suspended in a fog of the unknown, where invisible threats andunpredictable disasters can descend upon him any morning. He is willing tosurrender his consciousness to the man who offers him protection against thoseintangible questions which he does not wish to consider, yet dreads.Attila’s fear of reality is as great as the Witch Doctor’s. Both hold theirconsciousness on a subhuman level and method of functioning: Attila’s brain is ajumble of concretes unintegrated by abstractions; the Witch Doctor’s brain is amiasma of floating abstractions unrelated to concretes. Both are guided andmotivated—ultimately—not by thoughts, but by feelings and whims. Both cling totheir whims as to their only certainty. Both feel secretly inadequate to thetask of dealing with existence.Thus they come to need each other. Attila feels that the Witch Doctor can givehim what he lacks: a long-range view, an insurance against the dark unknown oftomorrow or next week or next year, a code of moral values to sanction hisactions and to disarm his victims. The Witch Doctor feels that Attila can givehim the material means of survival, can protect him from physical reality, canspare him the necessity of practical action, and can enforce his mystic edictson any recalcitrant who may choose to challenge his authority. Both of them areincomplete parts of a human being, who seek completion in each other: the man ofmuscle and the man of feelings, seeking to exist without mind.Since no man can fully escape the conceptual level of consciousness, it is notthe case that Attila and the Witch Doctor cannot or do not think; they can anddo—but thinking, to them, is not a means of perceiving reality, it is a means ofjustifying their escape from the necessity of rational perception. Reason, tothem, is a means of defeating their victims, a menial servant charged with thetask of rationalizing the metaphysical validity and power of their whims. Justas a bank robber will spend years of planning, ingenuity and effort in order toprove to himself that he can exist without effort, so both Attila and the WitchDoctor will go to any length of cunning, calculation and thought in order todemonstrate the impotence of thought and preserve the image of a pliableuniverse where miracles are possible and whims are efficacious. The power ofideas has no reality for either of them, and neither cares to learn that theproof of that power lies in his own chronic sense of guilt and terror.Thus Attila and the Witch Doctor form an alliance and divide their respectivedomains. Attila rules the realm of men’s physical existence—the Witch Doctorrules the realm of men’s consciousness. Attila herds men into armies—the WitchDoctor sets the armies’ goals. Attila conquers empires—the Witch Doctor writestheir laws. Attila loots and plunders—the Witch Doctor exhorts the victims tosurpass their selfish concern with material property. Attila slaughters—theWitch Doctor proclaims to the survivors that scourges are a retribution fortheir sins. Attila rules by means of fear, by keeping men under a constantthreat of destruction—the Witch Doctor rules by means of guilt, by keeping menconvinced of their innate depravity, impotence and insignificance. Attila turnsmen’s life on earth into a living hell—the Witch Doctor tells them that it couldnot be otherwise.But the alliance of the two rulers is precarious: it is based on mutual fear andmutual contempt. Attila is an extrovert, resentful of any concern withconsciousness—the Witch Doctor is an introvert, resentful of any concern withphysical existence. Attila professes scorn for values, ideals, principles,theories, abstractions—the Witch Doctor professes scorn for material property,for wealth, for man’s body, for this earth. Attila considers the Witch Doctorimpractical—the Witch Doctor considers Attila immoral. But, secretly, each ofthem believes that the other possesses a mysterious faculty he lacks, that theother is the true master of reality, the true exponent of the power to deal withexistence. In terms, not of thought, but of chronic anxiety, it is the WitchDoctor who believes that brute force rules the world—and it is Attila whobelieves in the supernatural; his name for it is “fate” or “luck.”Against whom is this alliance formed? Against those men whose existence andcharacter both Attila and the Witch Doctor refuse to admit into their view ofthe universe: the men who produce. In any age or society, there are men whothink and work, who discover how to deal with existence, how to produce theintellectual and the material values it requires. These are the men whose effortis the only means of survival for the parasites of all varieties: the Attilas,the Witch Doctors and the human ballast. The ballast consists of those who gothrough life in a state of unfocused stupor, merely repeating the words and themotions they learned from others. But the men from whom they learn, the men whoare first to discover any scrap of new knowledge, are the men who deal withreality, with the task of conquering nature, and who, to that extent, assume theresponsibility of cognition: of exercising their rational faculty.A producer is any man who works and knows what he is doing. He may function on afully human, conceptual level of awareness only some part of his time, but, tothat extent, he is the Atlas who supports the existence of mankind; he may spendthe rest of his time in an unthinking daze, like the others, and, to thatextent, he is the exploited, drained, tortured, self-destroying victim of theirschemes.Men’s epistemology—or, more precisely, their psycho-epistemology, their methodof awareness—is the most fundamental standard by which they can be classified.Few men are consistent in that respect; most men keep switching from one levelof awareness to another, according to the circumstances or the issues involved,ranging from moments of full rationality to an almost somnambulistic stupor. Butthe battle of human history is fought and determined by those who arepredominantly consistent, those who, for good or evil, are committed to andmotivated by their chosen psycho-epistemology and its corollary view ofexistence—with echoes responding to them, in support or opposition, in theswitching, flickering souls of the others.A man’s method of using his consciousness determines his method of survival. Thethree contestants are Attila, the Witch Doctor and the Producer—or the man offorce, the man of feelings, the man of reason—or the brute, the mystic, thethinker. The rest of mankind calls it expedient to be tossed by the current ofevents from one of those roles to another, not choosing to identify the factthat those three are the source which determines the current’s direction.The producers, so far, have been the forgotten men of history. With theexception of a few brief periods, the producers have not been the leaders or theterm-setters of men’s societies, although the degree of their influence andfreedom was the degree of a society’s welfare and progress. Most societies havebeen ruled by Attila and the Witch Doctor. The cause is not some innate tendencyto evil in human nature, but the fact that reason is a volitional faculty whichman has to choose to discover, employ and preserve. Irrationality is a state ofdefault, the state of an unachieved human stature. When men do not choose toreach the conceptual level, their consciousness has no recourse but to itsautomatic, perceptual, semi-animal functions. If a missing link between thehuman and the animal species is to be found, Attila and the Witch Doctor arethat missing link—the profiteers on men’s default. [. . .] The victim of the [nineteenth-century] intellectuals’ most infamous injusticewas the businessman.Having accepted the premises, the moral values and the position of WitchDoctors, the intellectuals were unwilling to differentiate between thebusinessman and Attila, between the producer of wealth and the looter. Like theWitch Doctor, they scorned and dreaded the realm of material reality, feelingsecretly inadequate to deal with it. Like the Witch Doctor’s, their secretvision (almost their feared and envied ideal) of a practical, successful man, atrue master of reality, was Attila; like the Witch Doctor, they believed thatforce, fraud, lies, plunder, expropriation, enslavement, murder were practical.So they did not inquire into the source of wealth or ever ask what made itpossible (they had been taught that causality is an illusion and that only theimmediate moment is real). They took it as their axiom, as an irreducibleprimary, that wealth can be acquired only by force—and that a fortune as such isthe proof of plunder, with no further distinctions or inquiries necessary.With their eyes still fixed on the Middle Ages, they were maintaining this inthe midst of a period when a greater amount of wealth than had ever beforeexisted in the world was being brought into existence all around them. If themen who produced that wealth were thieves, from whom had they stolen it? Underall the shameful twists of their evasions, the intellectuals’ answer was: fromthose who had not produced it. They were refusing to acknowledge the industrialrevolution (they are still refusing today). They were refusing to admit intotheir universe what neither Attila nor the Witch Doctor can afford to admit: theexistence of man, the Producer.Evading the difference between production and looting, they called thebusinessman a robber. Evading the difference between freedom and compulsion,they called him a slave driver. Evading the difference between reward andterror, they called him an exploiter. Evading the difference between pay checksand guns, they called him an autocrat. Evading the difference between trade andforce, they called him a tyrant. The most crucial issue they had to evade wasthe difference between the earned and the unearned.Ignoring the existence of the faculty they were betraying, the faculty ofdiscrimination, the intellect, they refused to identify the fact that industrialwealth was the product of man’s mind: that an incalculable amount ofintellectual power, of creative intelligence, of disciplined energy, of humangenius had gone into the creation of industrial fortunes. They could not affordto identify it, because they could not afford to admit the fact that theintellect is a practical faculty, a guide to man’s successful existence onearth, and that its task is the study of reality (as well as the production ofwealth), not the contemplation of unintelligible feelings nor a special monopolyon the “unknowable.”The Witch Doctor’s morality of altruism—the morality that damns all those whoachieve success or enjoyment on earth—provided the intellectuals with the meansto make a virtue of evasion. It gave them a weapon that disarmed their victims;it gave them an automatic substitute for self-esteem, and a chance at anunearned moral stature. They proclaimed themselves to be the defenders of thepoor against the rich, righteously evading the fact that the rich were notAttilas any longer—and the defenders of the weak against the strong, righteouslyevading the fact that the strength involved was not the strength of brutemuscles any longer, but the strength of man’s mind.But while the intellectuals regarded the businessman as Attila, the businessmanwould not behave as they, from the position of Witch Doctors, expected Attila tobehave: he was impervious to their power. The businessman was as bewildered byevents as the rest of mankind, he had no time to grasp his own historical role,he had no moral weapons, no voice, no defense, and—knowing no morality but thealtruist code, yet knowing also that he was functioning against it, thatself-sacrifice was not his role—he was helplessly vulnerable to theintellectuals’ attack. He would have welcomed eagerly the guidance of Aristotle,but had no use for Immanuel Kant. That which today is called “common sense” isthe remnant of an Aristotelian influence, and that was the businessman’s onlyform of philosophy. The businessman asked for proof and expected things to makesense—an expectation that kicked the intellectuals into the category of theunemployed. They had nothing to offer to a man who did not buy any shares of anyversion of the “noumenal” world.To understand the course the intellectuals chose to take, it is important toremember the Witch Doctor’s psycho-epistemology and his relationship to Attila:the Witch Doctor expects Attila to be his protector against reality, against thenecessity of rational cognition, and, at the same time, he expects to rule hisown protector, who needs an unintelligible mystic sanction as a narcotic torelieve his chronic guilt. They derive their mutual security, not from any formof strength, but from the fact that each has a hold on the other’s secretweakness. It is not the security of two traders, who count on the values theyoffer each other, but the security of two blackmailers, who count on eachother’s fear.The Witch Doctor feels like a metaphysical outcast in a capitalist society—as ifhe were pushed into some limbo outside of any universe he cares to recognize. Hehas no means to deal with innocence; he can get no hold on a man who does notseek to live in guilt, on a businessman who is confident of his ability to earnhis living—who takes pride in his work and in the value of his product—whodrives himself with inexhaustible energy and limitless ambition to do better andstill better and ever better—who is willing to bear penalties for his mistakesand expects rewards for his achievements—who looks at the universe with thefearless eagerness of a child, knowing it to be intelligible—who demandsstraight lines, clear terms, precise definitions—who stands in full sunlight andhas no use for the murky fog of the hidden, the secret, the unnamed, thefurtively evocative, for any code of signals from the psycho-epistemology ofguilt.What the businessman offered to the intellectuals was the spiritual counterpartof his own activity, that which the Witch Doctor dreads most: the freedom of themarket place of ideas.To live by the work of one’s mind, to offer men the products of one’s thinking,to provide them with new knowledge, to stand on nothing but the merit of one’sideas and to rely on nothing but objective truth, in a market open to any manwho is willing to think and has to judge, accept or reject on his own—is a taskthat only a man on the conceptual level of psycho-epistemology can welcome orfulfill. It is not the place for a Witch Doctor nor for any mystic “elite.”A Witch Doctor has to live by the favor of a protector, by a specialdispensation, by a reserved monopoly, by exclusion, by suppression, bycensorship.Having accepted the philosophy and the psycho-epistemology of the Witch Doctor,the intellectuals had to cut the ground from under their own feet and turnagainst their own historical distinction: against the first chance men had everhad to make a professional living by means of the intellect. When theintellectuals rebelled against the “commercialism” of a capitalist society, whatthey were specifically rebelling against was the open market of ideas, wherefeelings were not accepted and ideas were expected to demonstrate theirvalidity, where the risks were great, injustices were possible and no protectorexisted but objective reality.Just as Attila, since the Renaissance, was looking for a Witch Doctor of hisown, so the intellectuals, since the industrial revolution, were looking for anAttila of their own. The altruist morality brought them together and gave themthe weapon they needed. The field where they found each other was Socialism.It was not the businessmen or the industrialists or the workers or the laborunions or the remnants of the feudal aristocracy that began the revolt againstfreedom and the demand for the return of the absolute state: it was theintellectuals. It was the alleged guardians of reason who brought mankind backto the rule of brute force.Growing throughout the nineteenth century, originated in and directed fromintellectual salons, sidewalk cafés, basement beer joints and universityclassrooms, the industrial counter-revolution united the Witch Doctors and theAttila-ists. They demanded the right to enforce ideas at the point of a gun,that is: through the power of government, and compel the submission of others tothe views and wishes of those who would gain control of the government’smachinery. They extolled the State as the “Form of the Good,” with man as itsabject servant, and they proposed as many variants of the socialist state asthere had been of the altruist morality. But, in both cases, the variationsmerely played with the surface, while the cannibal essence remained the same:socialism is the doctrine that man has no right to exist for his own sake, thathis life and his work do not belong to him, but belong to society, that the onlyjustification of his existence is his service to society, and that society maydispose of him in any way it pleases for the sake of whatever it deems to be itsown tribal, collective good.It is only the Attila-ist, pragmatist, positivist, anti-conceptualmentality—which grants no validity to abstractions, no meaning to principles andno power to ideas—that can still wonder why a theoretical doctrine of that kindhad to lead in practice to the torrent of blood and brute, non-human horror ofsuch socialist societies as Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. Only the Attila-istmentality can still claim that nobody can prove that these had to be thenecessary results—or still try to blame it on the “imperfection” of human natureor on the evil of some specific gang who “betrayed a noble ideal,” and stillpromise that its own gang would do it better and make it work—or still mumble ina quavering voice that the motive was love of humanity.The pretenses have worn thin, the evasions do not work any longer; theintellectuals are aware of their guilt, but are still struggling to evade itscause and to pass it on to the universe at large, to man’s metaphysicallypredestined impotence.Guilt and fear are the disintegrators of a man’s consciousness or of a society’sculture. Today, America’s culture is being splintered into disintegration by thethree injunctions which permeate our intellectual atmosphere and which aretypical of guilt: don’t look—don’t judge—don’t be certain.The psycho-epistemological meaning and implementation of these three are: don’tintegrate—don’t evaluate—give up.The last stand of Attila-ism, both in philosophy and in science, is theconcerted assertion of all the neo-mystics that integration is impossible andunscientific. The escape from the conceptual level of consciousness, theprogressive contraction of man’s vision down to Attila’s range, has now reachedits ultimate climax. Withdrawing from reality and responsibility, theneo-mystics proclaim that no entities exist, only relationships, and that onemay study relationships without anything to relate, and, simultaneously, thatevery datum is single and discrete, and no datum can ever be related to anyother data—that context is irrelevant, that anything may be proved or disprovedin midair and midstream, and the narrower the subject of study, the better—thatmyopia is the hallmark of a thinker or a scientist.System-building-the integration of knowledge into a coherent sum and aconsistent view of reality—is denounced by all the Attila-ists as irrational,mystical and unscientific. This is Attila’s perennial way of surrendering to theWitch Doctor—and it explains why so many scientists are turning to God or tosuch flights of mysticism of their own as would make even an old-fashioned WitchDoctor blush. No consciousness can accept disintegration as a normal andpermanent state. Science was born as a result and consequence of philosophy; itcannot survive without a philosophical (particularly epistemological) base. Ifphilosophy perishes, science will be next to go.The abdication of philosophy is all but complete. Today’s philosophers, quaWitch Doctors, declare that nobody can define what is philosophy or what is itsspecific task, but this need not prevent anyone from practicing it as aprofession. Qua Attila-ists, they declare that the use of wide abstractions orconcepts is the prerogative of the layman or of the ignorant or of the man inthe street—white a philosopher is one who, knowing all the difficulties involvedin the problem of abstractions, deals with nothing but concretes.The injunction “don’t judge” is the ultimate climax of the altruist moralitywhich, today, can be seen in its naked essence. When men plead for forgiveness,for the nameless, cosmic forgiveness of an unconfessed evil, when they reactwith instantaneous compassion to any guilt, to the perpetrators of any atrocity,while turning away indifferently from the bleeding bodies of the victims and theinnocent—one may see the actual purpose, motive and psychological appeal of thealtruist code. When these same compassionate men turn with snarling hatred uponanyone who pronounces moral judgments, when they scream that the only evil isthe determination to fight against evil—one may see the kind of moral blankcheck that the altruist morality hands out.Perhaps the most craven attitude of all is the one expressed by the injunction“don’t be certain.” As stated explicitly by many intellectuals, it is thesuggestion that if nobody is certain of anything, if nobody holds any firmconvictions, if everybody is willing to give in to everybody else, no dictatorwill rise among us and we will escape the destruction sweeping the rest of theworld. This is the secret voice of the Witch Doctor confessing that he sees adictator, an Attila, as a man of confident strength and uncompromisingconviction. Nothing but a psycho-epistemological panic can blind suchintellectuals to the fact that a dictator, like any thug, runs from the firstsign of confident resistance; that he can rise only in a society of preciselysuch uncertain, compliant, shaking compromisers as they advocate, a society thatinvites a thug to take over; and that the task of resisting an Attila can beaccomplished only by men of intransigent conviction and moral certainty—not bychickens hiding their heads in the sand (“ostrich” is too big and dignified ametaphor for this instance).And, paving the way for Attila, the intellectuals are still repeating, not byconviction any longer, but by rote, that the growth of government power is notan abridgment of freedom—that the demand of one group for an unearned share ofanother group’s income is not socialism—that the destruction of property rightswill not affect any other rights—that man’s mind, intelligence, creative abilityare a “national resource” (like mines, forests, waterfalls, buffalo reserves andnational parks) to be taken over, subsidized and disposed of by thegovernment—that businessmen are selfish autocrats because they are struggling topreserve freedom, while the “liberals” are the true champions of liberty becausethey are fighting for more government controls—that the fact that we are slidingdown a road which has destroyed every other country, does not prove that it willdestroy ours—that dictatorship is not dictatorship if nobody calls it by thatabstract name—and that none of us can help it, anyway.Nobody believes any of it any longer, yet nobody opposes it. To oppose anything,one needs a firm set of principles, which means: a philosophy.If America perishes, it will perish by intellectual default. There is nodiabolical conspiracy to destroy it: no conspiracy could be big enough andstrong enough. Such cafeteria-socialist conspiracies as do undoubtedly exist aregroups of scared, neurotic mediocrities who find themselves pushed into nationalleadership because nobody else steps forward; they are like pickpockets whomerely intended to snatch a welfare-regulation or two and who suddenly find thattheir victim is unconscious, that they are alone in an enormous mansion offabulous wealth, with all the doors open and a seasoned burglar’s job on theirhands; watch them now screaming that they didn’t mean it, that they had neveradvocated the nationalization of a country’s economy. As to the communistconspirators in the service of Soviet Russia, they are the best illustration ofvictory by default: their successes are handed to them by the concessions oftheir victims. There is no national movement for socialism or dictatorship inAmerica, no “man on horseback” or popular demagogue, nothing but fumblingcompromisers and frightened opportunists. Yet we are moving toward full,totalitarian socialism, with worn, cynical voices telling us that such is theirresistible trend of history. History, fate and malevolent conspiracy areeasier to believe than the actual truth: that we are moved by nothing but thesluggish inertia of unfocused minds. [...] The New Intellectual will be the man who lives up to the exact meaning of histitle: a man who is guided by his intellect—not a zombie guided by feelings,instincts, urges, wishes, whims or revelations. Ending the rule of Attila andthe Witch Doctor, he will discard the basic premise that made them possible: thesoul-body dichotomy. He will discard its irrational conflicts andcontradictions, such as: mind versus heart, thought versus action, realityversus desire, the practical versus the moral. He will be an integrated man,that is: a thinker who is a man of action. He will know that ideas divorced fromconsequent action are fraudulent, and that action divorced from ideas issuicidal. He will know that the conceptual level of psycho-epistemology—thevolitional level of reason and thought—is the basic necessity of man’s survivaland his greatest moral virtue.

The men who try to replace the mind byseizing the products of the mind? Well, the man who despises himself tries togain self-esteem from sexual adventures—which can’t be done, because sex is notthe cause, but an effect and an expression of a man’s sense of his own value.”[. . .]The men who think that wealth comes from material resources and has nointellectual root or meaning, are the men who think—for the same reason—that sexis a physical capacity which functions independently of one’s mind, choice orcode of values. They think that your body creates a desire and makes a choicefor you—just about in some such way as if iron ore transformed itself intorailroad rails of its own volition. Love is blind, they say; sex is imperviousto reason and mocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a man’s sexualchoice is the result and the sum of his fundamental convictions. Tell me what aman finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.Show me the woman he sleeps with and I will tell you his valuation of himself.No matter what corruption he’s taught about the virtue of selflessness, sex isthe most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which he cannot perform for anymotive but his own enjoyment—just try to think of performing it in a spirit ofselfless charity!—an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only inself-exaltation, only in the confidence of being desired and being worthy ofdesire. It is an act that forces him to stand naked in spirit, as well as inbody, and to accept his real ego as his standard of value. He will always beattracted to the woman who reflects his deepest vision of himself, the womanwhose surrender permits him to experience—or to fake—a sense of self-esteem. Theman who is proudly certain of his own value, will want the highest type of womanhe can find, the woman he admires, the strongest, the hardest to conquer—becauseonly the possession of a heroine will give him the sense of an achievement, notthe possession of a brainless slut. [. . .]But the man who is convinced of his own worthlessness will be drawn to a womanhe despises—because she will reflect his own secret self, she will release himfrom that objective reality in which he is a fraud, she will give him amomentary illusion of his own value and a momentary escape from the moral codethat damns him. Observe the ugly mess which most men make of their sex lives—andobserve the mess of contradictions which they hold as their moral philosophy.One proceeds from the other. Love is our response to our highest values—and canbe nothing else. Let a man corrupt his values and his view of existence, let himprofess that love is not self-enjoyment but self-denial, that virtue consists,not of pride, but of pity or pain or weakness or sacrifice, that the noblestlove is born , not of admiration, but of charity, not in response to values, butin response to flaws—and he will have cut himself in two. His body will not obeyhim, it will not respond, it will make him impotent toward the woman heprofesses to love and draw him to the lowest type of whore he can find. His bodywill always follow the ultimate logic of his deepest convictions; if he believesthat flaws are values, he has damned existence as evil and only the evil willattract him. He has damned himself and he will feel that depravity is all he isworthy of enjoying. He has equated virtue with pain and he will feel that viceis the only realm of pleasure. Then he will scream that his body has viciousdesires of its own which his mind cannot conquer, that sex is sin, that truelove is a pure emotion of the spirit. And then he will wonder why love bringshim nothing but boredom, and sex—nothing but shame. [...][Y]ou’d never accept any part of their vicious creed. You wouldn’t be able toforce it upon yourself. If you tried to damn sex as evil, you’d still findyourself, against your will, acting on the proper moral premise. You’d beattracted to the highest woman you met. You’d always want a heroine. You’d beincapable of self-contempt. You’d be unable to believe that existence is eviland that you’re a helpless creature caught in an impossible universe. You’re theman who’s spent his life shaping matter to the purpose of his mind. You’re theman who would know that just as an idea unexpressed in physical action iscontemptible hypocrisy, so is platonic love—and just as physical action unguidedby an idea is a fool’s self-fraud, so is sex when cut off from one’s code ofvalues. It’s the same issue, and you would know it. Your inviolate sense ofself-esteem would know it. You would be incapable of desire for a woman youdespised. Only the man who extols the purity of a love devoid of desire, iscapable of the depravity of a desire devoid of love. But observe that mostpeople are creatures cut in half who keep swinging desperately to one side or tothe other. One kind of half is the man who despises money, factories,skyscrapers and his own body. He holds undefined emotions about non-conceivablesubjects as the meaning of life and as his claim to virtue. And he cries withdespair, because he can feel nothing for the woman he respects, but findshimself in bondage to an irresistible passion for a slut from the gutter. He isthe man whom people call an idealist. The other kind of half is the man whompeople call practical, the man who despises principles, abstractions, art,philosophy and his own mind. He regards the acquisition of material objects asthe only goal of existence—and he laughs at the need to consider their purposeor their source. He expects them to give him pleasure—and he wonders why themore he gets, the less he feels. He is the man who spends his time chasingwomen. Observe the triple fraud which he perpetrates upon himself. He will notacknowledge his need of self-esteem, since he scoffs at such a concept as moralvalues; yet he feels the profound self-contempt which comes from believing thathe is a piece of meat. He will not acknowledge, but he knows that sex is thephysical expression of a tribute to personal values. So he tries, by goingthrough the motions of the effect, to acquire that which should have been thecause. He tries to gain a sense of his own value from the women who surrender tohim—and he forgets that the women he picks have neither character nor judgmentnor standard of value. He tells himself that all he’s after is physicalpleasure—but observe that he tires of his women in a week or a night, that hedespises professional whores and that he loves to imagine he is seducingvirtuous girls who make a great exception for his sake. It is the feeling ofachievement that he seeks and never finds. What glory can there be in theconquest of a mindless body? . . .032 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_032_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: A speech given by AR in the late 1960s, “Of Living Death”(published in The Voice of Reason), identifies the connection between theCatholic Church’s basic philosophy and its view of sex.OF LIVING DEATHTHOSE WHO wish to observe the role of philosophy in human existence may see itdramatized on a grand (and gruesome) scale in the conflict splitting theCatholic church today.Observe, in that conflict, men’s fear of identifying or challengingphilosophical fundamentals: both sides are willing to fight in silent confusion,to stake their beliefs, their careers, their reputations on the outcome of abattle over the effects of an unnamed cause. One side is composed predominantlyof men who dare not name the cause; the other, of men who dare not discover it.Both sides claim to be puzzled and disappointed by what they regard as acontradiction in the two recent encyclicals of Pope Paul VI. The so-calledconservatives (speaking in religious, not political, terms) were dismayed by theencyclical Populorum Progressio (On the Development of Peoples)—which advocatedglobal statism—while the so-called liberals hailed it as a progressive document.Now the conservatives are hailing the encyclical Humanae Vitae (Of HumanLife)—which forbids the use of contraceptives—while the liberals are dismayed byit. Both sides seem to find the two documents inconsistent. But theinconsistency is theirs, not the pontiff’s. The two encyclicals are strictly,flawlessly consistent in respect to their basic philosophy and ultimate goal:both come from the same view of man’s nature and are aimed at establishing thesame conditions for his life on earth. The first of these two encyclicalsforbade ambition, the second forbids enjoyment; the first enslaved man to thephysical needs of others, the second enslaves him to the physical capacities ofhis own body; the first damned achievement, the second damns love.The doctrine that man’s sexual capacity belongs to a lower or animal part of hisnature has had a long history in the Catholic church. It is the necessaryconsequence of the doctrine that man is not an integrated entity, but a beingtorn apart by two opposite, antagonistic, irreconcilable elements: his body,which is of this earth, and his soul, which is of another, supernatural realm.According to that doctrine, man’s sexual capacity—regardless of how it isexercised or motivated, not merely its abuses, not unfastidious indulgence orpromiscuity, but the capacity as such—is sinful or depraved.For centuries, the dominant teaching of the church held that sexuality is evil,that only the need to avoid the extinction of the human species grants sex thestatus of a necessary evil and, therefore, only procreation can redeem or excuseit. In modern times, many Catholic writers have denied that such is the church’sview. But what is its view? They did not answer.Let us see if we can find the answer in the encyclical Humanae Vitae.Dealing with the subject of birth control, the encyclical prohibits all forms ofcontraception (except the so-called “rhythm method”). The prohibition is total,rigid, unequivocal. It is enunciated as a moral absolute.Bear in mind what this subject entails. Try to hold an image of horror spreadacross space and time—across the entire globe and through all the centuries—theimage of parents chained, like beasts of burden, to the physical needs of agrowing brood of children—young parents aging prematurely while fighting alosing battle against starvation—the skeletal hordes of unwanted children bornwithout a chance to live—the unwed mothers slaughtered in the unsanitary dens ofincompetent abortionists—the silent terror hanging, for every couple, over everymoment of love. If one holds this image while hearing that this nightmare is notto be stopped, the first question one will ask is: Why? In the name of humanity,one will assume that some inconceivable, but crucially important reason mustmotivate any human being who would seek to let that carnage go on uncontested.So the first thing one will look for in the encyclical, is that reason, ananswer to that Why?“The problem of birth,” the encyclical declares, “like every other problemregarding human life, is to be considered ... in the light of an integral visionof man and of his vocation, not only his natural and earthly, but also hissupernatural and eternal, vocation.” [Paragraph 7]And:A reciprocal act of love, which jeopardizes the responsibility to transmit lifewhich God the Creator, according to particular laws, inserted therein, is incontradiction with the design constitutive of marriage, and with the will of theauthor of life. To use this divine gift, destroying, even if only partially, itsmeaning and its purpose, is to contradict the nature both of man and of womanand of their most intimate relationship, and therefore it is to contradict alsothe plan of God and His will. [13]And this is all. In the entire encyclical, this is the only reason given (butrepeated over and over again) why men should transform their highest experienceof happiness—their love—into a source of lifelong agony. Do so—the encyclicalcommands—because it is God’s will.I, who do not believe in God, wonder why those who do would ascribe to him sucha sadistic design, when God is supposed to be the archetype of mercy, kindness,and benevolence. What earthly goal is served by that doctrine? The answer runslike a hidden thread through the encyclical’s labyrinthian convolutions,repetitions, and exhortations.In the darker corners of that labyrinth, one finds some snatches of argument, inalleged support of the mystic axiom, but these arguments are embarrassinglytransparent equivocations. For instance:... to make use of the gift of conjugal love while respecting the laws of thegenerative process means to acknowledge oneself not to be the arbiter of thesources of human life, but rather the minister of the design established by theCreator. In fact, just as man does not have unlimited dominion over his body ingeneral, so also, with particular reason, he has no such dominion over hiscreative faculties as such, because of their intrinsic ordination toward raisingup life, of which God is the principle. [13]What is meant here by the words “man does not have unlimited dominion over hisbody in general”? The obvious meaning is that man cannot change the metaphysicalnature of his body; which is true. But man has the power of choice in regard tothe actions of his body—specifically, in regard to “his creative faculties,” andthe responsibility for the use of these particular faculties is most cruciallyhis. “To acknowledge oneself not to be the arbiter of the sources of human life”is to evade and to default on that responsibility. Here again, the sameequivocation or package deal is involved. Does man have the power to determinethe nature of his procreative faculty? No. But granted that nature, is he thearbiter of bringing a new human life into existence? He most certainly is, andhe (with his mate) is the sole arbiter of that decision—and the consequences ofthat decision affect and determine the entire course of his life.This is a clue to that paragraph’s intention: if man believed that so crucial achoice as procreation is not in his control, what would it do to his controlover his life, his goals, his future?The passive obedience and helpless surrender to the physical functions of one’sbody, the necessity to let procreation be the inevitable result of the sexualact, is the natural fate of animals, not of men. In spite of its concern withman’s higher aspirations, with his soul, with the sanctity of married love—it isto the level of animals that the encyclical seeks to reduce man’s sex life, infact, in reality, on earth. What does this indicate about the encyclical’s viewof sex?Anticipating certain obvious objections, the encyclical declares:Now, some may ask: In the present case, is it not reasonable in manycircumstances to have recourse to artificial birth control if, thereby, wesecure the harmony and peace of the family, and better conditions for theeducation of children already born? To this question it is necessary to replywith clarity: The church is the first to praise and recommend the interventionof intelligence in a function which so closely associates the rational creaturewith his Creator; but she affirms that this must be one with respect for theorder established by God. [16]To what does this subordinate man’s intelligence? If intelligence is forbiddento consider the fundamental problems of man’s existence, forbidden to alleviatehis suffering, what does this indicate about the encyclical’s view of man—and ofreason?History can answer this particular question. History has seen a period ofapproximately ten centuries, known as the Dark and Middle Ages, when philosophywas regarded as “the handmaiden of theology,” and reason as the humblesubordinate of faith. The results speak for themselves.It must not be forgotten that the Catholic church has fought the advance ofscience since the Renaissance: from Galileo’s astronomy, to the dissection ofcorpses, which was the start of modern medicine, to the discovery of anesthesiain the nineteenth century, the greatest single discovery in respect to theincalculable amount of terrible suffering it has spared mankind. The Catholicchurch has fought medical progress by means of the same argument: that theapplication of knowledge to the relief of human suffering is an attempt tocontradict God’s design. Specifically in regard to anesthesia during childbirth,the argument claimed that since God intended woman to suffer while giving birth,man has no right to intervene. (!)The encyclical does not recommend unlimited procreation. It does not object toall means of birth control—only to those it calls “artificial” (i.e.,scientific). It does not object to man “contradicting God’s will” nor to manbeing “the arbiter of the sources of human life,” provided he uses the means itendorses: abstinence.Discussing the issue of “responsible parenthood,” the encyclical states: “Inrelation to physical, economic, psychological and social conditions, responsibleparenthood is exercised, either by the deliberate and generous decision to raisea numerous family, or by the decision, made for grave motives and with duerespect for the moral law, to avoid for the time being, or even for anindeterminate period, a new birth.” [10] To avoid—by what means? By abstainingfrom sexual intercourse.The lines preceding that passage are: “In relation to the tendencies of instinctor passion, responsible parenthood means the necessary dominion which reason andwill must exercise over them.” [10] How a man is to force his reason to obey anirrational injunction and what it would do to him psychologically, is notmentioned.Further on, under the heading “Mastery of Self,” the encyclical declares:To dominate instinct by means of one’s reason and free will undoubtedly requiresascetic practices.... Yet this discipline which is proper to the purity ofmarried couples, far from harming conjugal love, rather confers on it a higherhuman value. It demands continual effort yet, thanks to its beneficentinfluence, husband and wife fully develop their personalities, being enrichedwith spiritual values. . . . Such discipline . . . helps both parties to driveout selfishness, the enemy of true love; and deepens their sense ofresponsibility. [21]If you can bear that style of expression being used to discuss suchmatters—which I find close to unbearable—and if you focus on the meaning, youwill observe that the “discipline,” the “continual effort,” the “beneficentinfluence,” the “higher human value” refer to the torture of sexual frustration.No, the encyclical does not say that sex as such is evil; it merely says thatsexual abstinence in marriage is “a higher human value.” What does this indicateabout the encyclical’s view of sex—and of marriage?Its view of marriage is fairly explicit. “[Conjugal] love is first of all fullyhuman, that is to say, of the senses and of the spirit at the same time. It isnot, then, a simple transport of instinct and sentiment, but also, andprincipally, an act of the free will, intended to endure and to grow by means ofthe joys and sorrows of daily life, in such a way that husband and wife becomeone only heart and one only soul, and together attain their human perfection.“Then this love is total; that is to say, it is a very special form of personalfriendship, in which husband and wife generously share everything, without unduereservations or selfish calculations.” [9]To classify the unique emotion of romantic love as a form of friendship is toobliterate it: the two emotional categories are mutually exclusive. The feelingof friendship is asexual; it can be experienced toward a member of one’s ownsex.There are many other indications of this kind scattered through the encyclical.For instance: “These acts, by which husband and wife are united in chasteintimacy and by means of which human life is transmitted, are, as the councilrecalled, ‘noble and worthy.’ ” [11] It is not chastity that one seeks in sex,and to describe it this way is to emasculate the meaning of marriage.There are constant references to a married couple’s duties, which have to beconsidered in the context of the sexual act—“duties toward God, towardthemselves, toward the family and toward society.” [10] If there is any oneconcept which, when associated with sex, would render a man impotent, it is theconcept of “duty.”To understand the full meaning of the encyclical’s view of sex, I shall ask youto identify the common denominator—the common intention —of the followingquotations:[The church’s] teaching, often set forth by the Magisterium, is founded upon theinseparable connection, willed by God and unable to be broken by man on his owninitiative, between the two meanings of the conjugal act: the unitive meaningand the procreative meaning. Indeed, by its intimate structure, the conjugalact, while most closely uniting husband and wife, capacitates them for thegeneration of new lives. [12]“[The conjugal acts] do not cease to be lawful if, for causes independent of thewill of husband and wife, they are foreseen to be infecund.” [11, emphasisadded.]The church forbids: “every action which, either in anticipation of the conjugalact or its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences,proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible.”[14]The church does not object to “an impediment to procreation” which might resultfrom the medical treatment of a disease, “provided such impediment is not, forwhatever motive, directly willed,” [15, emphasis added.]And finally, the church “teaches that each and every marriage act (‘quilibetmatrimonii usus,’) must remain open to the transmission of life.” [11]What is the common denominator of these statements? It is not merely the tenetthat sex as such is evil, but deeper: it is the commandment by means of whichsex will become evil, the commandment which, if accepted, will divorce sex fromlove, will castrate man spiritually and will turn sex into a meaninglessphysical indulgence. That commandment is: man must not regard sex as an end initself, but only as a means to an end.Procreation and “God’s design” are not the major concern of that doctrine; theyare merely primitive rationalizations to which man’s self-esteem is to besacrificed. If it were otherwise, why the stressed insistence on forbidding manto impede procreation by his conscious will and choice? Why the tolerance of theconjugal acts of couples who are infecund by nature rather than by choice? Whatis so evil about that choice? There is only one answer: that choice rests on acouple’s conviction that the justification of sex is their own enjoyment. Andthis is the view which the church’s doctrine is intent on forbidding at anyprice.That such is the doctrine’s intention, is supported by the church’s stand on theso-called “rhythm method” of birth control, which the encyclical approves andrecommends.The church is coherent with herself when she considers recourse to the infecundperiods to be licit, while at the same time condemning, as being always illicit,the use of means directly contrary to fecundation, even if such use is inspiredby reasons which may appear honest and serious.... It is true that, in the oneand the other case, the married couple are concordant in the positive will ofavoiding children for plausible reasons, seeking the certainty that offspringwill not arrive; but it is also true that only in the former case are they ableto renounce the use of marriage in the fecund periods when, for just motives,procreation is not desirable, while making use of it during infecund periods tomanifest their affection and to safeguard their mutual fidelity. By so doing,they give proof of a truly and integrally honest love. [16]On the face of it, this does not make any kind of sense at all—and the churchhas often been accused of hypocrisy or compromise because it permits this veryunreliable method of birth control while forbidding all others. But examine thatstatement from the aspect of its intention, and you will see that the church isindeed “coherent with herself,” i.e., consistent.What is the psychological difference between the “rhythm method” and other meansof contraception? The difference lies in the fact that, using the “rhythmmethod,” a couple cannot regard sexual enjoyment as a right and as an end initself. With the help of some hypocrisy, they merely sneak and snatch somepersonal pleasure, while keeping the marriage act “open to the transmission oflife,” thus acknowledging that childbirth is the only moral justification of sexand that only by the grace of the calendar are they unable to comply.This acknowledgment is the meaning of the encyclical’s peculiar implication that“to renounce the use of marriage in the fecund periods” is, somehow, a virtue (arenunciation which proper methods of birth control would not require). What elsebut this acknowledgment can be the meaning of the otherwise unintelligiblestatement that by the use of the “rhythm method” a couple “give proof of a trulyand integrally honest love”?There is a widespread popular notion to the effect that the Catholic church’smotive in opposing birth control is the desire to enlarge the Catholicpopulation of the world. This may be superficially true of some people’smotives, but it is not the full truth. If it were, the Catholic church wouldforbid the “rhythm method” along with all other forms of contraception. And,more important, the Catholic church would not fight for anti-birth-controllegislation all over the world: if numerical superiority were its motive, itwould forbid birth control to its own followers and let it be available to otherreligious groups.The motive of the church’s doctrine on this issue is, philosophically, muchdeeper than that and much worse; the goal is not metaphysical or political orbiological, but psychological: if man is forbidden to regard sexual enjoyment asan end in itself, he will not regard love or his own happiness as an end initself; if so, then he will not regard his own life as an end in itself; if so,then he will not attain self-esteem.It is not against the gross, animal, physicalistic theories or uses of sex thatthe encyclical is directed, but against the spiritual meaning of sex in man’slife. (By “spiritual” I mean pertaining to man’s consciousness.) It is notdirected against casual, mindless promiscuity, but against romantic love.To make this clear, let me indicate, in brief essentials, a rational view of therole of sex in man’s existence.Sex is a physical capacity, but its exercise is determined by man’s mind—by hischoice of values, held consciously or subconsciously. To a rational man, sex isan expression of self-esteem—a celebration of himself and of existence. To theman who lacks self-esteem, sex is an attempt to fake it, to acquire itsmomentary illusion.Romantic love, in the full sense of the term, is an emotion possible only to theman (or woman) of unbreached self-esteem: it is his response to his own highestvalues in the person of another—an integrated response of mind and body, of loveand sexual desire. Such a man (or woman) is incapable of experiencing a sexualdesire divorced from spiritual values. [. . .] In other words, sexual promiscuity is to be condemned not because sex as such isevil, but because it is good—too good and too important to be treated casually.In comparison to the moral and psychological importance of sexual happiness, theissue of procreation is insignificant and irrelevant, except as a deadlythreat—and God bless the inventors of the Pill!The capacity to procreate is merely a potential which man is not obligated toactualize. The choice to have children or not is morally optional. Nature endowsman with a variety of potentials—and it is his mind that must decide whichcapacities he chooses to exercise, according to his own hierarchy of rationalgoals and values. The mere fact that man has the capacity to kill does not meanthat it is his duty to become a murderer; in the same way, the mere fact thatman has the capacity to procreate does not mean that it is his duty to commitspiritual suicide by making procreation his primary goal and turning himselfinto a stud-farm animal.It is only animals that have to adapt themselves to their physical backgroundand to the biological functions of their bodies. Man adapts his physicalbackground and the use of his biological faculties to himself—to his own needsand values. That is his distinction from all other living species.To an animal, the rearing of its young is a matter of temporary cycles. To man,it is a lifelong responsibility—a grave responsibility that must not beundertaken causelessly, thoughtlessly, or accidentally.In regard to the moral aspects of birth control, the primary right involved isnot the “right” of an unborn child, or of the family, or of society, or of God.The primary right is one which—in today’s public clamor on the subject—few, ifany, voices have had the courage to uphold: the right of man and woman to theirown life and happiness—the right not to be regarded as the means to any end.Man is an end in himself. Romantic love—the profound, exalted, lifelong passionthat unites his mind and body in the sexual act—is the living testimony to thatprinciple.This is what the encyclical seeks to destroy; or, more precisely, to obliterate,as if it does not and cannot exist.Observe the encyclical’s contemptuous references to sexual desire as “instinct”or “passion,” as if “passion” were a pejorative term. Observe the falsedichotomy offered; man’s choice is either mindless, “instinctual” copulation—ormarriage, an institution presented not as a union of passionate love, but as arelationship of “chaste intimacy,” of “special personal friendship,” of“discipline proper to purity,” of unselfish duty, of alternating bouts withfrustration and pregnancy, and of such unspeakable,Grade-B-movie-folks-next-door kind of boredom that any semi-living man wouldhave to run, in self-preservation, to the nearest whorehouse.No, I am not exaggerating. I have reserved—as my last piece of evidence on thequestion of the encyclical’s view of sex—the paragraph in which the coils andveils of euphemistic equivocation got torn, somehow, and the naked truth showsthrough.It reads as follows:Upright men can even better convince themselves of the solid grounds on whichthe teaching of the church in this field is based, if they care to reflect uponthe consequences of methods of artificial birth control. Let them consider,first of all, how wide and easy a road would thus be opened up toward conjugalinfidelity and the general lowering of morality. Not much experience is neededin order to know human weakness, and to understand that men—especially theyoung, who are so vulnerable on this point—have need of encouragement to befaithful to the moral law, so that they must not be offered some easy means ofeluding its observance. It is also to be feared that the man, growing used tothe employment of anticonceptive practices, may finally lose respect for thewoman and, no longer caring for her physical and psychological equilibrium, maycome to the point of considering her as a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment,and no longer as his respected and beloved companion. [17]I cannot conceive of a rational woman who does not want to be precisely aninstrument of her husband’s selfish enjoyment. I cannot conceive of what wouldhave to be the mental state of a woman who could desire or accept the positionof having a husband who does not derive any selfish enjoyment from sleeping withher. I cannot conceive of anyone, male or female, capable of believing thatsexual enjoyment would destroy a husband’s love and respect for his wife—butregarding her as a brood mare and himself as a stud, would cause him to love andrespect her.Actually, this is too evil to discuss much further.But we must also take note of the first part of that paragraph. It states that“artificial” contraception would open “a wide and easy road toward conjugalinfidelity.” Such is the encyclical’s actual view of marriage: that maritalfidelity rests on nothing better than fear of pregnancy. Well, “not muchexperience is needed in order to know” that that fear has never been much of adeterrent to anyone.Now observe the inhuman cruelty of that paragraph’s reference to the young.Admitting that the young are “vulnerable on this point,” and declaring that theyneed “encouragement to be faithful to the moral law,” the encyclical forbidsthem the use of contraceptives, thus making it cold-bloodedly clear that itsidea of moral encouragement consists of terror—the sheer, stark terror of youngpeople caught between their first experience of love and the primitive brutalityof the moral code of their elders. Surely the authors of the encyclical cannotbe ignorant of the fact that it is not the young chasers or the teenage slutswho would be the victims of a ban on contraceptives, but the innocent young whorisk their lives in the quest for love—the girl who finds herself pregnant andabandoned by her boyfriend, or the boy who is trapped into a premature, unwantedmarriage. To ignore the agony of such victims—the countless suicides, the deathsat the hands of quack abortionists, the drained lives wasted under the doubleburden of a spurious “dishonor” and of an unwanted child—to ignore all that inthe name of “the moral law” is to make a mockery of morality. [...] This leads us to the encyclical’s stand on the issue of abortion, and to anotherexample of inhuman cruelty. Compare the coiling sentimentality of theencyclical’s style when it speaks of “conjugal love” to the clear, brusque,military tone of the following: “We must once again declare that the directinterruption of the generative process already begun, and, above all, directlywilled and procured abortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to beabsolutely excluded as licit means of regulating birth.” [14, emphasis added.]After extolling the virtue and sanctity of motherhood, as a woman’s highestduty, as her “eternal vocation,” the encyclical attaches a special risk of deathto the performance of that duty—an unnecessary death, in the presence of doctorsforbidden to save her, as if a woman were only a screaming huddle of infectedflesh who must not be permitted to imagine that she has the right to live.And this policy is advocated by the encyclical’s supporters in the name of theirconcern for “the sanctity of life” and for “rights”—the rights of the embryo.(!)I suppose that only the psychological mechanism of projection can make itpossible for such advocates to accuse their opponents of being “anti-life.”Observe that the men who uphold such a concept as “the rights of an embryo,” arethe men who deny, negate, and violate the rights of a living human being.An embryo has no rights. Rights do not pertain to a potential, only to an actualbeing. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living takeprecedence over the not yet living (or the unborn).Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of thewoman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to beconsidered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her whatdisposition she is to make of the functions of her own body? The Catholic churchis responsible for this country’s disgracefully barbarian anti-abortion laws,which should be repealed and abolished.The intensity of the importance that the Catholic church attaches to itsdoctrine on sex may be gauged by the enormity of the indifference to humansuffering expressed in the encyclical. Its authors cannot be ignorant of thefact that man has to earn his living by his own effort, and that there is nocouple on earth—on any level of income, in any country, civilized or not—whowould be able to support the number of children they would produce if theyobeyed the encyclical to the letter.If we assume the richest couple and include time off for the periods of“purity,” it will still be true that the physical and psychological strain oftheir “vocation” would be so great that nothing much would be left of them,particularly of the mother, by the time they reached the age of forty.Consider the position of an average American couple. What would be their life,if they succeeded in raising, say, twelve children, by working from morning tillnight, by running a desperate race with the periodic trips to maternity wards,with rent bills, grocery bills, clothing bills, pediatricians’ bills,strained-vegetables bills, school book bills, measles, mumps, whooping cough,Christmas trees, movies, ice cream cones, summer camps, party dresses, dates,draft cards, hospitals, colleges—with every salary raise of the industrious,hardworking father mortgaged and swallowed before it is received—what would theyhave gained at the end of their life except the hope that they might be able topay their cemetery bills, in advance?Now consider the position of the majority of mankind, who are barely able tosubsist on a level of prehistorical poverty. No strain, no back-breaking effortof the ablest, most conscientious father can enable him properly to feed onechild—let alone an open-end progression. The unspeakable misery of stunted,disease-eaten, chronically undernourished children, who die in droves before theage of ten, is a matter of public record. Pope Paul VI—who closes his encyclicalby mentioning his title as earthly representative of “the God of holiness andmercy”—cannot be ignorant of these facts; yet he is able to ignore them. [. . .] The global state advocated in Populorum Progressio is a nightmare utopia whereall are enslaved to the physical needs of all; its inhabitants are selflessrobots, programmed by the tenets of altruism, without personal ambition, withoutmind, pride, or self-esteem. But self-esteem is a stubborn enemy of all utopiasof that kind, and it is doubtful whether mere economic enslavement would destroyit wholly in men’s souls. What Populorum Progressio was intended to achieve fromwithout, in regard to the physical conditions of man’s existence, Humanae Vitaeis intended to achieve from within, in regard to the devastation of man’sconsciousness.“Don’t allow men to be happy,” said Ellsworth Toohey in The Fountainhead.“Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient.... Happy men are free men. Sokill their joy in living.... Make them feel that the mere fact of a personaldesire is evil.... Unhappy men will come to you. They’ll need you. They’ll comefor consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’ssoul—and the space is yours to fill.”Deprived of ambition, yet sentenced to endless toil; deprived of rewards, yetordered to produce; deprived of sexual enjoyment, yet commanded to procreate;deprived of the right to live, yet forbidden to die—condemned to this state ofliving death, the graduates of the encyclical Humanae Vitae will be ready tomove into the world of Populorum Progressio; they will have no other place togo.“If some man like Hugh Akston,” said Hank Rearden in Atlas Shrugged, “had toldme, when I started, that by accepting the mystics’ theory of sex I was acceptingthe looters’ theory of economics, I would have laughed in his face. I would notlaugh at him now.”It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that in the subconscious hierarchy ofmotives of the men who wrote these two encyclicals, the second, Humanae Vitae,was merely the spiritual means to the first, Populorum Progressio, which was thematerial end. The motives, I believe, were the reverse: Populorum Progressio wasmerely the material means to Humanae Vitae, which was the spiritual end.“. . . with our predecessor Pope John XXIII,” says Pope Paul VI in HumanaeVitae, “we repeat: no solution to these difficulties is acceptable ‘which doesviolence to man’s essential dignity’ and is based only ‘on an utterlymaterialistic conception of man himself and of his life.’ ” [23, emphasisadded.] They mean it—though not exactly in the way they would have us believe.In terms of reality, nothing could be more materialistic than an existencedevoted to feeding the whole world and procreating to the limit of one’scapacity. But when they say “materialistic,” they mean pertaining to man’s mindand to this earth; by “spiritual,” they mean whatever is anti-man, anti-mind,anti-life, and, above all, anti-possibility of human happiness on earth.The ultimate goal of these encyclicals’ doctrine is not the material advantagesto be gained by the rulers of a global slave state; the ultimate goal is thespiritual emasculation and degradation of man, the extinction of his love oflife, which Humanae Vitae is intended to accomplish, and Populorum Progressiomerely to embody and perpetuate.The means of destroying man’s spirit is unearned guilt.What I said in “Requiem for Man” about the motives of Populorum Progressioapplies as fully to Humanae Vitae, with only a minor paraphrase pertaining toits subject. “But, you say, the encyclical’s ideal will not work? It is notintended to work. It is not intended to [achieve human chastity or sexualvirtue]; it is intended to induce guilt. It is not intended to be accepted andpracticed; it is intended to be accepted and broken—broken by man’s ‘selfish’desire to [love], which will thus be turned into a shameful weakness. Men whoaccept as an ideal an irrational goal which they cannot achieve, never lifttheir heads thereafter—and never discover that their bowed heads were the onlygoal to be achieved.” [. . .]033 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_033_r1.jpg]This issue is not confined to the Catholic church, and it is deeper than theproblem of contraception; it is a moral crisis approaching a climax. The core ofthe issue is Western civilization’s view of man and of his life. The essence ofthat view depends on the answer to two interrelated questions: Is man (man theindividual) an end in himself? —and: Does man have the right to be happy on thisearth?Throughout its history, the West has been torn by a profound ambivalence onthese questions: all of its achievements came from those periods when men actedas if the answer were “Yes”—but, with exceedingly rare exceptions, theirspokesmen, the philosophers, kept proclaiming a thunderous “No,” in countlessforms.Neither an individual nor an entire civilization can exist indefinitely with anunresolved conflict of that kind. Our age is paying the penalty for it. And itis our age that will have to resolve it.034 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_034_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: In a 1964 Playboy interview, AR indicated her views on issuessuch as the proper relationship between reason and emotion, the connectionbetween career and romance, and the nature of love.ON EMOTIONS, INCLUDING LOVE... LET’S DEFINE our terms. Reason is man’s tool of knowledge, the faculty thatenables him to perceive the facts of reality. To act rationally means to act inaccordance with the facts of reality. Emotions are not tools of cognition. Whatyou feel tells you nothing about the facts; it merely tells you something aboutyour estimate of the facts. Emotions are the result of your value judgments;they are caused by your basic premises, which you may hold consciously orsubconsciously, which may be right or wrong. A whim is an emotion whose causeyou neither know nor care to discover. Now what does it mean, to act on whim? Itmeans that a man acts like a zombie, without any knowledge of what he dealswith, what he wants to accomplish, or what motivates him. It means that a manacts in a state of temporary insanity. [. . .]An emotion is an automatic response, an automatic effect of man’s valuepremises. An effect, not a cause. There is no necessary clash, no dichotomybetween man’s reason and his emotions—provided he observes their properrelationship. A rational man knows—or makes it a point to discover—the source ofhis emotions, the basic premises from which they come; if his premises arewrong, he corrects them. He never acts on emotions for which he cannot account,the meaning of which he does not understand. In appraising a situation, he knowswhy he reacts as he does and whether he is right. He has no inner conflicts, hismind and his emotions are integrated, his consciousness is in perfect harmony.His emotions are not his enemies, they are his means of enjoying life. But theyare not his guide; the guide is his mind. This relationship cannot be reversed,however. If a man takes his emotions as the cause and his mind as their passiveeffect, if he is guided by his emotions and uses his mind only to rationalize orjustify them somehow—then he is acting immorally, he is condemning himself tomisery, failure, defeat, and he will achieve nothing but destruction—his own andthat of others. [. . .] The only man capable of experiencing a profound romantic love is the man drivenby passion for his work—because love is an expression of self-esteem, of thedeepest values in a man’s or a woman’s character. One falls in love with theperson who shares these values. If a man has no clearly defined values, and nomoral character, he is not able to appreciate another person. In this respect, Iwould like to quote from The Fountainhead, in which the hero utters a line thathas often been quoted by readers: “To say ‘I love you’ one must know first howto say the ‘I.’ ” [...]When you are in love, it means that the person you love is of great personal,selfish importance to you and to your life. If you were selfless, it would haveto mean that you derive no personal pleasure or happiness from the company andthe existence of the person you love, and that you are motivated only byself-sacrificial pity for that person’s need of you. I don’t have to point outto you that no one would be flattered by, nor would accept, a concept of thatkind. Love is not self-sacrifice, but the most profound assertion of your ownneeds and values. It is for your own happiness that you need the person youlove, and that is the greatest compliment, the greatest tribute you can pay tothat person....035 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_035_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"3. Theory of Concepts In 1966, AR published her seminal (and most technical) work in philosophy,Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology. Its purpose is to validate reason onthe most fundamental level—by identifying the nature, and the basis in reality,of the human mind’s unique form of knowledge: concepts. This book is AR’s answerto the nominalists and the “realists” in philosophy, i.e., to the “problem ofuniversals.”We have included in the following selections some essentials from her theory ofconcepts—along with a few excerpts from the seminars she gave on the book whenit first came out; the seminars were attended mostly by philosophers unfamiliarwith her theory.CONCEPT-FORMATIONA CONCEPT is a mental integration of two or more units which are isolatedaccording to a specific characteristic(s) and united by a specific definition.The units involved may be any aspect of reality: entities, attributes, actions,qualities, relationships, etc.; they may be perceptual concretes or other,earlier-formed concepts. The act of isolation involved is a process ofabstraction: i.e., a selective mental focus that takes out or separates acertain aspect of reality from all others (e.g., isolates a certain attibutefrom the entities possessing it, or a certain action from the entitiesperforming it, etc.). The uniting involved is not a mere sum, but anintegration, i.e., a blending of the units into a single, new mental entitywhich is used thereafter as a single unit of thought (but which can be brokeninto its component units whenever required).In order to be used as a single unit, the enormous sum integrated by a concepthas to be given the form of a single, specific, perceptual concrete, which willdifferentiate it from all other concretes and from all other concepts. This isthe function performed by language. Language is a code of visual-auditorysymbols that serves the psycho-epistemological function of converting conceptsinto the mental equivalent of concretes. Language is the exclusive domain andtool of concepts. Every word we use (with the exception of proper names) is asymbol that denotes a concept, i.e., that stands for an unlimited number ofconcretes of a certain kind.(Proper names are used in order to identify and include particular entities in aconceptual method of cognition. Observe that even proper names, in advancedcivilizations, follow the definitional principles of genus and differentia:e.g., John Smith, with “Smith” serving as genus and “John” as differentia—or NewYork, U.S.A.)Words transform concepts into (mental) entities; definitions provide them withidentity. (Words without definitions are not language but inarticulate sounds.)We shall discuss definitions later and at length.The above is a general description of the nature of concepts as products of acertain mental process. But the question of epistemology is: what precisely isthe nature of that process? To what precisely do concepts refer in reality?Let us now examine the process of forming the simplest concept, the concept of asingle attribute (chronologically, this is not the first concept that a childwould grasp; but it is the simplest one epistemologically) —for instance, theconcept “length.” If a child considers a match, a pencil and a stick, heobserves that length is the attribute they have in common, but their specificlengths differ. The difference is one of measurement. In order to form theconcept “length,” the child’s mind retains the attribute and omits itsparticular measurements. Or, more precisely, if the process were identified inwords, it would consist of the following: “Length must exist in some quantity,but may exist in any quantity. I shall identify as ‘length’ that attribute ofany existent possessing it which can be quantitatively related to a unit oflength, without specifying the quantity.”The child does not think in such words (he has, as yet, no knowledge of words),but that is the nature of the process which his mind performs wordlessly. Andthat is the principle which his mind follows, when, having grasped the concept“length” by observing the three objects, he uses it to identify the attribute oflength in a piece of string, a ribbon, a belt, a corridor or a street.The same principle directs the process of forming concepts of entities—forinstance, the concept “table.” The child’s mind isolates two or more tables fromother objects, by focusing on their distinctive characteristic: their shape. Heobserves that their shapes vary, but have one characteristic in common: a flat,level surface and support (s). He forms the concept “table” by retaining thatcharacteristic and omitting all particular measurements, not only themeasurements of the shape, but of all the other characteristics of tables (manyof which he is not aware of at the time).An adult definition of “table” would be: “A man-made object consisting of aflat, level surface and support(s), intended to support other, smaller objects.”Observe what is specified and what is omitted in this definition: thedistinctive characteristic of the shape is specified and retained; theparticular geometrical measurements of the shape (whether the surface is square,round, oblong or triangular, etc., the number and shape of supports, etc.) areomitted; the measurements of size or weight are omitted; the fact that it is amaterial object is specified, but the material of which it is made is omitted,thus omitting the measurements that differentiate one material from another;etc. Observe, however, that the utilitarian requirements of the table setcertain limits on the omitted measurements, in the form of “no larger than andno smaller than” required by its purpose. This rules out a ten-foot tall or atwo-inch tall table (though the latter may be sub-classified as a toy or aminiature table) and it rules out unsuitable materials, such as non-solids.Bear firmly in mind that the term “measurements omitted” does not mean, in thiscontext, that measurements are regarded as non-existent; it means thatmeasurements exist, but are not specified. That measurements must exist is anessential part of the process. The principle is: the relevant measurements mustexist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity.A child is not and does not have to be aware of all these complexities when heforms the concept “table.” He forms it by differentiating tables from all otherobjects in the context of his knowledge. As his knowledge grows, the definitionsof his concepts grow in complexity. (We shall discuss this when we discussdefinitions.) But the principle and pattern of concept-formation remain thesame.The first words a child learns are words denoting visual objects, and he retainshis first concepts visually. Observe that the visual form he gives them isreduced to those essentials which distinguish the particular kind of entitiesfrom all others—for instance, the universal type of a child’s drawing of man inthe form of an oval for the torso, a circle for the head, four sticks forextremities, etc. Such drawings are a visual record of the process ofabstraction and concept-formation in a mind’s transition from the perceptuallevel to the full vocabulary of the conceptual level.There is evidence to suppose that written language originated in the form ofdrawings—as the pictographic writing of the Oriental peoples seems to indicate.With the growth of man’s knowledge and of his power of abstraction, a pictorialrepresentation of concepts could no longer be adequate to his conceptual range,and was replaced by a fully symbolic code.A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the samedistinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.The element of similarity is crucially involved in the formation of everyconcept; similarity, in this context, is the relationship between two or moreexistents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure ordegree.Observe the multiple role of measurements in the process of concept-formation,in both of its two essential parts: differentiation and integration. Conceptscannot be formed at random. All concepts are formed by first differentiating twoor more existents from other existents. All conceptual differentiations are madein terms of commensurable characteristics (i.e., characteristics possessing acommon unit of measurement). No concept could be formed, for instance, byattempting to distinguish long objects from green objects. Incommensurablecharacteristics cannot be integrated into one unit.Tables, for instance, are first differentiated from chairs, beds and otherobjects by means of the characteristic of shape, which is an attribute possessedby all the objects involved. Then, their particular kind of shape is set as thedistinguishing characteristic of tables—i.e., a certain category of geometricalmeasurements of shape is specified. Then, within that category, the particularmeasurements of individual table-shapes are omitted.Please note the fact that a given shape represents a certain category or set ofgeometrical measurements. Shape is an attribute; differences of shape—whethercubes, spheres, cones or any complex combinations—are a matter of differingmeasurements; any shape can be reduced to or expressed by a set of figures interms of linear measurement. When, in the process of concept-formation, manobserves that shape is a commensurable characteristic of certain objects, hedoes not have to measure all the shapes involved nor even to know how to measurethem; he merely has to observe the element of similarity.Similarity is grasped perceptually; in observing it, man is not and does nothave to be aware of the fact that it involves a matter of measurement. It is thetask of philosophy and of science to identify that fact.As to the actual process of measuring shapes, a vast part of higher mathematics,from geometry on up, is devoted to the task of discovering methods by whichvarious shapes can be measured—complex methods which consist of reducing theproblem to the terms of a simple, primitive method, the only one available toman in this field: linear measurement. (Integral calculus, used to measure thearea of circles, is just one example.)In this respect, concept-formation and applied mathematics have a similar task,just as philosophical epistemology and theoretical mathematics have a similargoal: the goal and task of bringing the universe within the range of man’sknowledge—by identifying relationships to perceptual data.Another example of implicit measurement can be seen in the process of formingconcepts of colors. Man forms such concepts by observing that the various shadesof blue are similar, as against the shades of red, and thus differentiating therange of blue from the range of red, of yellow, etc. Centuries passed beforescience discovered the unit by which colors could actually be measured: thewavelengths of light—a discovery that supported, in terms of mathematical proof,the differentiations that men were and are making in terms of visualsimilarities. (Any questions about “borderline cases” will be answered later.)A commensurable characteristic (such as shape in the case of tables, or hue inthe case of colors) is an essential element in the process of concept-formation.I shall designate it as the “Conceptual Common Denominator” and define it as“The characteristic(s) reducible to a unit of measurement, by means of which mandifferentiates two or more existents from other existents possessing it.”The distinguishing characteristic(s) of a concept represents a specifiedcategory of measurements within the “Conceptual Common Denominator” involved.New concepts can be formed by integrating earlier-formed concepts into widercategories, or by subdividing them into narrower categories (a process which weshall discuss later). But all concepts are ultimately reducible to their base inperceptual entities, which are the base (the given) of man’s cognitivedevelopment.The first concepts man forms are concepts of entities—since entities are theonly primary existents. (Attributes cannot exist by themselves, they are merelythe characteristics of entities; motions are motions of entities; relationshipsare relationships among entities.)In the process of forming concepts of entities, a child’s mind has to focus on adistinguishing characteristic—i.e., on an attribute—in order to isolate onegroup of entities from all others. He is, therefore, aware of attributes whileforming his first concepts, but he is aware of them perceptually, notconceptually. It is only after he has grasped a number of concepts of entitiesthat he can advance to the stage of abstracting attributes from entities andforming separate concepts of attributes. The same is true of concepts of motion:a child is aware of motion perceptually, but cannot conceptualize “motion” untilhe has formed some concepts of that which moves, i.e., of entities.(As far as can be ascertained, the perceptual level of a child’s awareness issimilar to the awareness of the higher animals: the higher animals are able toperceive entities, motions, attributes, and certain numbers of entities. Butwhat an animal cannot perform is the process of abstraction—of mentallyseparating attributes, motions or numbers from entities. It has been said thatan animal can perceive two oranges or two potatoes, but cannot grasp the concept“two.”)Concepts of materials are formed by observing the differences in the constituentmaterials of entities. (Materials exist only in the form of specific entities,such as a nugget of gold, a plank of wood, a drop or an ocean of water.) Theconcept of “gold,” for instance, is formed by isolating gold objects from allothers, then abstracting and retaining the material, the gold, and omitting themeasurements of the objects (or of the alloys) in which gold may exist. Thus,the material is the same in all the concrete instances subsumed under theconcept, and differs only in quantity.Concepts of motion are formed by specifying the distinctive nature of the motionand of the entities performing it, and/or of the medium in which it isperformed—and omitting the particular measurements of any given instance of suchmotion and of the entities involved. For instance, the concept “walking” denotesa certain kind of motion performed by living entities possessing legs, and doesnot apply to the motion of a snake or of an automobile. The concept “swimming”denotes the motion of any living entity propelling itself through water, anddoes not apply to the motion of a boat. The concept “flying” denotes the motionof any entity propelling itself through the air, whether a bird or an airplane.Adverbs are concepts of the characteristics of motion (or action); they areformed by specifying a characteristic and omitting the measurements of themotion and of the entities involved—e.g., “rapidly,” which may be applied to“walking” or “swimming” or “speaking,” etc., with the measurement of what is“rapid” left open and depending, in any given case, on the type of motioninvolved.Prepositions are concepts of relationships, predominantly of spatial or temporalrelationships, among existents; they are formed by specifying the relationshipand omitting the measurements of the existents and of the space or timeinvolved—e.g., “on,” “in,” “above,” “after,” etc.Adjectives are concepts of attributes or of characteristics. Pronouns belong tothe category of concepts of entities. Conjunctions are concepts of relationshipsamong thoughts, and belong to the category of concepts of consciousness.As to concepts of consciousness, we shall discuss them later and at length. (Toanticipate questions such as: “Can you measure love?”—I shall permit myself thevery philosophical answer: “And how!”)Now we can answer the question: To what precisely do we refer when we designatethree persons as “men”? We refer to the fact that they are living beings whopossess the same characteristic distinguishing them from all other livingspecies: a rational faculty—though the specific measurements of theirdistinguishing characteristic qua men, as well as of all their othercharacteristics qua living beings, are different. (As living beings of a certainkind, they possess innumerable characteristics in common: the same shape, thesame range of size, the same facial features, the same vital organs, the samefingerprints, etc., and all these characteristics differ only in theirmeasurements.)Two links between the conceptual and the mathematical fields are worth noting atthis point, apart from the obvious fact that the concept “unit” is the base andstart of both.I. A concept is not formed by observing every concrete subsumed under it, anddoes not specify the number of such concretes. A concept is like an arithmeticalsequence of specifically defined units, going off in both directions, open atboth ends and including all units of that particular kind. For instance, theconcept “man” includes all men who live at present, who have ever lived or willever live. An arithmetical sequence extends into infinity, without implying thatinfinity actually exists; such extension means only that whatever number ofunits does exist, it is to be included in the same sequence. The same principleapplies to concepts: the concept “man” does not (and need not) specify whatnumber of men will ultimately have existed—it specifies only the characteristicsof man, and means that any number of entities possessing these characteristicsis to be identified as “men.”2. The basic principle of concept-formation (which states that the omittedmeasurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity) is theequivalent of the basic principle of algebra, which states that algebraicsymbols must be given some numerical value, but may be given any value. In thissense and respect, perceptual awareness is the arithmetic, but conceptualawareness is the algebra of cognition.The relationship of concepts to their constituent particulars is the same as therelationship of algebraic symbols to numbers. In the equation 2a = a + a, anynumber may be substituted for the symbol “a” without affecting the truth of theequation. For instance: 2 x 5 = 5 + 5, or: 2 x 5,000,000 = 5,000,000 +5,000,000. In the same manner, by the same psycho-epistemological method, aconcept is used as an algebraic symbol that stands for any of the arithmeticalsequence of units it subsumes.Let those who attempt to invalidate concepts by declaring that they cannot find“manness” in men, try to invalidate algebra by declaring that they cannot find“a-ness” in 5 or in 5,000,000.036 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_036_r1.jpg][...] Let us note, at this point, the radical difference between Aristotle’sview of concepts and the Objectivist view, particularly in regard to the issueof essential characteristics.It is Aristotle who first formulated the principles of correct definition. It isAristotle who identified the fact that only concretes exist. But Aristotle heldthat definitions refer to metaphysical essences, which exist in concretes as aspecial element or formative power, and he held that the process ofconcept-formation depends on a kind of direct intuition by which man’s mindgrasps these essences and forms concepts accordingly.Aristotle regarded “essence” as metaphysical; Objectivism regards it asepistemological.Objectivism holds that the essence of a concept is that fundamentalcharacteristic(s) of its units on which the greatest number of othercharacteristics depend, and which distinguishes these units from all otherexistents within the field of man’s knowledge. Thus the essence of a concept isdetermined contextually and may be altered with the growth of man’s knowledge.The metaphysical referent of man’s concepts is not a special, separatemetaphysical essence, but the total of the facts of reality he has observed, andthis total determines which characteristics of a given group of existents hedesignates as essential. An essential characteristic is factual, in the sensethat it does exist, does determine other characteristics and does distinguish agroup of existents from all others; it is epistemological in the sense that theclassification of “essential characteristic” is a device of man’s method ofcognition—a means of classifying, condensing and integrating an ever-growingbody of knowledge.Now refer to the four historical schools of thought on the issue of concepts,which I listed in the foreword to this work—and observe that the dichotomy of“intrinsic or subjective” has played havoc with this issue, as it has with everyissue involving the relationship of consciousness to existence.The extreme realist (Platonist) and the moderate realist (Aristotelian) schoolsof thought regard the referents of concepts as intrinsic, i.e., as “universals”inherent in things (either as archetypes or as metaphysical essences), asspecial existents unrelated to man’s consciousness—to be perceived by mandirectly, like any other kind of concrete existents, but perceived by somenon-sensory or extra-sensory means.The nominalist and the conceptualist schools regard concepts as subjective,i.e., as products of man’s consciousness, unrelated to the facts of reality, asmere “names” or notions arbitrarily assigned to arbitrary groupings of concreteson the ground of vague, inexplicable resemblances.The extreme realist school attempts, in effect, to preserve the primacy ofexistence (of reality) by dispensing with consciousness—i.e., by convertingconcepts. into concrete existents and reducing consciousness to the perceptuallevel, i.e., to the automatic function of grasping percepts (by supernaturalmeans, since no such percepts exist).The extreme nominalist (contemporary) school attempts to establish the primacyof consciousness by dispensing with existence (with reality)—i.e., by denyingthe status of existents even to concretes and converting concepts intoconglomerates of fantasy, constructed out of the debris of other, lesserfantasies, such as words without referents or incantations of soundscorresponding to nothing in an unknowable reality.To compound the chaos: it must be noted that the Platonist school begins byaccepting the primacy of consciousness, by reversing the relationship ofconsciousness to existence, by assuming that reality must conform to the contentof consciousness, not the other way around—on the premise that the presence ofany notion in man’s mind proves the existence of a corresponding referent inreality. But the Platonist school still retains some vestige of respect forreality, if only in unstated motivation: it distorts reality into a mysticalconstruct in order to extort its sanction and validate subjectivism. Thenominalist school begins, with empiricist humility, by negating the power ofconsciousness to form any valid generalizations about existence—and ends up witha subjectivism that requires no sanction, a consciousness freed from the“tyranny” of reality.None of these schools regards concepts as objective, i.e., as neither revealednor invented, but as produced by man’s consciousness in accordance with thefacts of reality, as mental integrations of factual data computed by man—as theproducts of a cognitive method of classification whose processes must beperformed by man, but whose content is dictated by reality.It is as if, philosophically, mankind is still in the stage of transition whichcharacterizes a child in the process of learning to speak—a child who is usinghis conceptual faculty, but has not developed it sufficiently to be able toexamine it self-consciously and discover that what he is using is reason.037 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_037_r1.jpg]CONSCIOUSNESS AND IDENTITY... MAN IS neither infallible nor omniscient; if he were, a discipline such asepistemology—the theory of knowledge—would not be necessary nor possible: hisknowledge would be automatic, unquestionable and total. But such is not man’snature. Man is a being of volitional consciousness: beyond the level ofpercepts—a level inadequate to the cognitive requirements of his survival—manhas to acquire knowledge by his own effort, which he may exercise or not, and bya process of reason, which he may apply correctly or not. Nature gives him noautomatic guarantee of his mental efficacy; he is capable of error, of evasion,of psychological distortion. He needs a method of cognition, which he himselfhas to discover: he must discover how to use his rational faculty, how tovalidate his conclusions, how to distinguish truth from falsehood, how to setthe criteria of what he may accept as knowledge. Two questions are involved inhis every conclusion, conviction, decision, choice or claim: What do Iknow?—and: How do I know it?It is the task of epistemology to provide the answer to the “How?”—which thenenables the special sciences to provide the answers to the “What?”In the history of philosophy—with some very rare exceptions—epistemologicaltheories have consisted of attempts to escape one or the other of the twofundamental questions which cannot be escaped. Men have been taught either thatknowledge is impossible (skepticism) or that it is available without effort(mysticism). These two positions appear to be antagonists, but are, in fact, twovariants on the same theme, two sides of the same fraudulent coin: the attemptto escape the responsibility of rational cognition and the absolutism ofreality—the attempt to assert the primacy of consciousness over existence.Although skepticism and mysticism are ultimately interchangeable, and thedominance of one always leads to the resurgence of the other, they differ in theform of their inner contradiction—the contradiction, in both cases, betweentheir philosophical doctrine and their psychological motivation.Philosophically, the mystic is usually an exponent of the intrinsic (revealed)school of epistemology; the skeptic is usually an advocate of epistemologicalsubjectivism. But, psychologically, the mystic is a subjectivist who usesintrinsicism as a means to claim the primacy of his consciousness over that ofothers. The skeptic is a disillusioned intrinsicist who, having failed to findautomatic supernatural guidance, seeks a substitute in the collectivesubjectivism of others.The motive of all the attacks on man’s rational faculty—from any quarter, in anyof the endless variations, under the verbal dust of all the murky volumes—is asingle, hidden premise: the desire to exempt consciousness from the law ofidentity. The hallmark of a mystic is the savagely stubborn refusal to acceptthe fact that consciousness, like any other existent, possesses identity, thatit is a faculty of a specific nature, functioning through specific means. Whilethe advance of civilization has been eliminating one area of magic afteranother, the last stand of the believers in the miraculous consists of theirfrantic attempts to regard identity as the disqualifying element ofconsciousness.The implicit, but unadmitted premise of the neo-mystics of modern philosophy, isthe notion that only an ineffable consciousness can acquire a valid knowledge ofreality, that “true” knowledge has to be causeless, i.e., acquired without anymeans of cognition.The entire apparatus of Kant’s system, like a hippopotamus engaged inbelly-dancing, goes through its gyrations while resting on a single point: thatman’s knowledge is not valid because his consciousness possesses identity. “Hisargument, in essence, ran as follows: man is limited to a consciousness of aspecific nature, which perceives by specific means and no others, therefore, hisconsciousness is not valid; man is blind, because he has eyes—deaf, because hehas ears—deluded, because he has a mind—and the things he perceives do notexist, because he perceives them.” (For the New Intellectual. )This is a negation, not only of man’s consciousness, but of any consciousness,of consciousness as such, whether man’s, insect’s or God’s. (If one supposed theexistence of God, the negation would still apply: either God perceives throughno means whatever, in which case he possesses no identity—or he perceives bysome divine means and no others, in which case his perception is not valid.) AsBerkeley negated existence by claiming that “to be, is to be perceived,” so Kantnegates consciousness by implying that to be perceived, is not to be.What Kant implied through coils of obfuscating verbiage, his more consistentfollowers declared explicitly. The following was written by a Kantian: “With him[Kant] all is phenomenal [mere appearance] which is relative, and all isrelative which is an object to a conscious subject. The conceptions of theunderstanding as much depend on the constitution of our thinking faculties, asthe perceptions of the senses do on the constitution of our intuitive faculties.Both might be different, were our mental constitution changed; both probably aredifferent to beings differently constituted. The real thus becomes identicalwith the absolute, with the object as it is in itself, out of all relation to asubject; and, as all consciousness is a relation between subject and object, itfollows that to attain a knowledge of the real we must go out of consciousness.”(Henry Mansel, “On the Philosophy of Kant,” reprinted in Henry Mansel, Letters,Lectures and Reviews, ed. H. W Chandler, London: John Murray, 1873, p. 171.)From primordial mysticism to this, its climax, the attack on man’s consciousnessand particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallengedpremise that any knowledge acquired by a process of consciousness is necessarilysubjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is “processedknowledge.”Make no mistake about the actual meaning of that premise: it is a revolt, notonly against being conscious, but against being alive—since in fact, in reality,on earth, every aspect of being alive involves a process of self-sustaining andself-generated action. (This is an example of the fact that the revolt againstidentity is a revolt against existence. “The desire not to be anything, is thedesire not to be.” Atlas Shrugged.)All knowledge is processed knowledge—whether on the sensory, perceptual orconceptual level. An “unprocessed” knowledge would be a knowledge acquiredwithout means of cognition. Consciousness (as I said in the first sentence ofthis work) is not a passive state, but an active process. And more: thesatisfaction of every need of a living organism requires an act of processing bythat organism, be it the need of air, of food or of knowledge.No one would argue (at least, not yet) that since man’s body has to process thefood he eats, no objective rules of proper nutrition can ever be discovered-that“true nutrition” has to consist of absorbing some ineffable substance withoutthe participation of a digestive system, but since man is incapable of “truefeeding,” nutrition is a subjective matter open to his whim, and it is merely asocial convention that forbids him to eat poisonous mushrooms.No one would argue that since nature does not tell man automatically what toeat—as it does not tell him automatically how to form concepts—he should abandonthe illusion that there is a right or wrong way of eating (or he should revertto the safety of the time when he did not have to “trust” objective evidence,but could rely on dietary laws prescribed by a supernatural power).No one would argue that man eats bread rather than stones purely as a matter of“convenience.”It is time to grant to man’s consciousness the same cognitive respect one grantsto his body—i.e., the same objectivity.Objectivity begins with the realization that man (including his every attributeand faculty, including his consciousness) is an entity of a specific nature whomust act accordingly; that there is no escape from the law of identity, neitherin the universe with which he deals nor in the working of his own consciousness,and if he is to acquire knowledge of the first, he must discover the propermethod of using the second; that there is no room for the arbitrary in anyactivity of man, least of all in his method of cognition—and just as he haslearned to be guided by objective criteria in making his physical tools, so hemust be guided by objective criteria in forming his tools of cognition : hisconcepts.Just as man’s physical existence was liberated when he grasped the principlethat “nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed,” so his consciousness will beliberated when he grasps that nature, to be apprehended , must be obeyed—thatthe rules of cognition must be derived from the nature of existence and thenature, the identity, of his cognitive faculty.038 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_038_r1.jpg]ABSTRACTION FROM ABSTRACTIONSFIRST-LEVEL CONCEPTSProf. F: I have a fundamental question about the hierarchy of concepts. On page22 you say, “The meaning of ‘furniture’ cannot be grasped unless one has firstgrasped the meaning of its constituent concepts; these are its link to reality.”Now, what about the meaning of “table”: can we say that the meaning of “table”cannot be grasped unless one has first grasped the meaning of “dining table,”“conference table,” “writing table,” and so forth? Are these its constituentconcepts? Or is the concept “table” a kind of privileged concept that comes at akind of absolute bottom in the hierarchy of concepts and has a directrelationship to reality?Or would you say that where a concept comes is determined by the context ofone’s own learning? For instance, might a person form the concept of “furniture”without having formed the concept of “table” before? Might he form the conceptof “living being” before he has formed the concept of “animal”?AR: In a sense, yes. There is a big problem here, however, whether this appliesall the way through the conceptual chain—which I would claim cannot be the case.But, on the level we are discussing, there is a certain element of the optional.Because when you first form your concepts, you might conceivably first form in avery loose way the concepts “living entity” versus “inanimate object,” and latersubdivide into “man,” “animals,” “plants,” etc. (and “tables,” “rocks,”“houses,” on the other hand). In a loose way, that can be done, but only up to acertain level. Because, suppose you started with the concept “living being.” Youwould then find that that is too generalized a category, and you would have tosay, in effect, “By living beings I mean men, animals, and plants.”Therefore, understanding what your original semi-concept “living being” meantwould depend on what you mean by the constituents, such as “man,” “animal,” and“plant.”What then is the ultimate determinant here? What I call the “first level” ofconcepts are existential concretes—that to which you can point as if it were anostensive definition and say: “I mean this.” Now, you can point to a table. Youcannot point to furniture. You have to say, “By furniture I mean ...” and youwould have to include all kinds of objects.Prof. F: Why wouldn’t one have an equal difficulty when one came, let’s say, tothe concept of “bird”? Why wouldn’t one have to say, “By bird, I mean eagles,penguins, and hummingbirds”?AR: Because, in fact, one doesn’t. And that is the difference betweensubcategories of concepts and first-level concepts. Because, you see, you couldnot arrive at the differences between eagles, hummingbirds, etc., unless you hadfirst separated birds from other animals.Even if chronologically you may learn those concepts in different orders,ultimately when you organize your concepts to determine which are basic-levelconcepts and which are derivatives (in both directions, wider integration ornarrower subdivision), the test will be: which objects you perceive directly inreality and can point to, and which you have to differentiate by means of otherconcepts.Prof. F: Then you are suggesting that metaphysically there are certain lowestspecies or infima species: certain concepts that are directly tied to concretes.Whereas, on top of them, we continually build higher-order concepts, whichrefer, in turn, to the lower.AR: Yes, if you mean, by “metaphysical,” existential objects—entities whichexist qua entities.Prof. E: I’d like to ask a follow-up question. This is the kind of question Iget all the time, which I do not fully know how to answer. I will give theexample: “table” is first-level, and then you can go up to “furniture” or downto “living-room table,” etc.AR: That’s right.Prof. E: Then I get this kind of question: Is it theoretically possible forsomeone to start by first conceptualizing living-room tables (he wouldn’t, ofcourse, be able to call it “living-room table” since he wouldn’t yet have theconcept “table”) and then “desk,” etc. and have separate concepts for all ofwhat we call subcategories of “table,” and then one day, in effect, grasp in anact of higher integration that they have something uniting them all, and reachthe concept “table”?AR: Theoretically, maybe; existentially, no. By which I mean that in order to dothat, if that is how a child starts, he would have to live in a furniture store.He would have to have observed an enormous number of certain kinds of tables sothat he isolates them first and then arrives at the overall category, which is“table.”Here, the process is directed by what is available to the child’s observationwhen he begins to form the concept.Prof. E: Would the state of his ability to discriminate also be relevant todefining what is a first-level concept? In other words, he couldn’t perhapsdiscriminate subtler distinctions before he had the gross category.AR: Exactly. And he has to have, and this is very essential, a sufficient numberof examples of a given category differentiated from other dissimilar entitiesbefore he can form a concept.Prof. E: What do you say about this objection? People say you can’t point totable, all you can point to is living-room table, or dining-room table, etc.,and, therefore, how do you distinguish “table” from “furniture” in this respect?AR: The answer is in the Conceptual Common Denominator. If you point to tableand you say “I mean this,” what do you differentiate it from? From chairs,cabinets, beds, etc. You do not mean only a dining-room table but not an endtable. What is involved here, in the act of pointing, as in everything aboutconcepts, is: from what are you differentiating it?Prof. B: Isn’t the issue then what similarities and differences you are able tobe aware of? And wouldn’t that be a function of two things: the actualproperties of the objects plus the context that you are in?AR: That’s right.Prof. B: Take the earlier question of whether you could form the concept of“furniture” before the concept “table.” In order to do that, you would have toperceive the similarities uniting all items of furniture before you perceivedthe difference between a table and, say, a bed. And the question is: how couldthat ever come up?AR: The difficulty here is that the infant or child would have to have a muchwider range of perception than is normal to a beginning consciousness. He wouldhave to consider objects outside of the room, objects moving in the street, andthen conclude: by “furniture” I mean the objects in this room. Even subverbally,if this is what he observes, he has already made an enormously wide range ofobservations, which is not likely as a beginning. In logic, there would beobjections to that, because how would he differentiate furniture from, let’ssay, moving vehicles in the street? How did he get to that wide a range withoutfirst observing the immediate differences and similarities around him?Prof. B: If he looked at a bed and a dresser, let’s, say, he would have to seethem as different before he saw them as similar.AR: That’s right. Also, remember that we use “table” as an example because thatis the object most likely to be one of the first perceived by a child in ourcivilization. But now suppose a child has to grasp the concept “coconut.” In ourcivilization that would be a much later development. He would probably firstgrasp “food,” then maybe “apple” and “pear,” until some day he discovers anunusual food—a coconut. But now take a child in a primitive society, in ajungle. He never heard of tables, and he might be bewildered when he first seesa table in the home of the local missionary. But “coconut” might be one of thefirst concepts he forms because coconuts are all around him.The overall rule for what is first-level is: those existential concretes whichare first available to your consciousness. But they have to be concretes. Afirst-level concept cannot be one which, in order to indicate what you mean byit, requires other concepts, as is the case with “furniture.” “Furniture” is nota term designating concretes directly. It is a term designating different kindsof concretes which all have to be conceptualized, as against another very broadcategory, such as moving vehicles, let us say.In other words, if, after you have acquired a conceptual vocabulary, a givenconcept cannot be understood by you or communicated by you without reference toother concepts, then it is a higher-level concept, even if maybe somehow yougrasped it first (and I question the issue of whether you could grasp it first).But the hierarchy that you will establish eventually when you are in the realmof a developed language, the hierarchy of which concept depends on the other,will not be determined by the accidental order in which you learned them,because that can have a great deal of the optional element and depends on whatis available in your immediate surroundings.It is after you are in the realm of language, when you can organize yourconcepts and say what you mean by “table,” what you mean by “furniture”—it is atthis level, logically and not chronologically, that you can determine which areconcepts of the first order and which are derivatives.039 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_039_r1.jpg]INDUCTIONProf. H: This is a common question relating to induction. Someone is boilingwater, and he notices that every time the water gets to a certain temperature,it boils. Now he wants to know: does all water boil at that temperature, or isit only due to some accidental feature about this particular water? How does hedetermine whether it’s accidental or essential?AR: By whether you can or cannot establish a causal connection between what youhave determined to be the essential characteristic of water and the fact that itboils at a certain temperature.Prof. H: I suppose what I’m asking is: how do you establish the causalconnection?AR: That’s a scientific question. But, in essence, what you do is this. Let’ssay you have to establish the molecular structure of water. How do thosemolecules act at a certain temperature? And if you see that something happens tothe molecules which causes boiling at a certain temperature, you conclude:that’s essential to the nature of water, adding the parenthesis: “within thepresent context of my knowledge.” You will later discover that water behavesdifferently at a different altitude. So you never claim water necessarily, as anabsolute, will always and everywhere boil at the same temperature. No, you say,“Within my present context, omitting elements of which I have no knowledge atpresent, water will always boil at a certain temperature, because boiling is astate depending on certain kind of molecular motions, and water’s molecules willalways reach that stage at a certain temperature.”Now, with later development, you might discover that maybe there are differencesin certain molecules of water when in an impure state. Or with atomic additions,say, something else happens. But then your context has changed. You don’t saythat water has changed. It’s only that your definition of how the essentialcharacteristic of water will function will have to include more: what water willdo at sea level, what it will do at higher altitudes, and what it will do undernew molecular or atomic influences, or in relation to some scientific phenomenonnot yet known to any of us. But the principle there is the same. Does thatanswer it?Prof. H: I have to think about it.AR: Okay, but ask again later, because I don’t want to leave you withsemi-answers. And that is the rational procedure: think it over, and if afurther question occurs to you, then ask me later. This applies to everybodyelse as well. If any answer is only partial, the right thing to do is to thinkit over, because one can’t discuss it and integrate it at the same time. If yousee that there is still an area not covered, then ask me later.Prof. A: How would you answer this common objection to your answer ? In relatingthe boiling of water to the energy required to break certain molecular bonds,you haven’t actually made any progress in regard to the induction, becauseyou’ve only got the same kind of generalization on the molecular level that youhad before on the gross, macroscopic level. You now know, “In a given number ofcases, it has always taken a certain amount of energy to break this molecularbond.” But that fact has the same sort of status as the fact you started with:“In a given number of cases, I heated the water to 212 degrees, and it alwaysboiled.” I know the objection is crazy, because in some way you do have moreknowledge when you’ve gone down to the molecular level. But I can’t see what theerror is.AR: But you see, you answered it. When you simply boil water, you do not knowthat it has molecules, nor what happens to those molecules. When you arrive atthat later stage of knowledge, you’ve discovered something about water and theconditions of its boiling which you didn’t know before. And, therefore, withinyour present context, this is a sufficient explanation, even though it’s not theexclusive and final explanation. To reach that you would have to haveomniscience. But, if you can say, “It’s in the nature of water that it’scomposed of molecules, and something happens to those molecules at a certaintemperature, this explains to me why water boils,” that is a causal explanation.It isn’t the same thing as saying, “I don’t know why it boils, but if I heat it,it bubbles up.” That’s all that you knew before. And, therefore, your knowledgeis now further advanced.Prof. A: But it seems that the certainty that you were first trying to attach tothe idea that water boils under certain conditions is derivative from the degreeof certainty you have concerning the idea that a certain amount of energydisrupts the molecules.AR: If this is supposed to be on the same level, what would the person raisingthis objection consider to be a different level?Prof. A: Yes, that’s exactly the problem.AR: That’s not the problem. No. That’s the method of ruling his objection out.Because you discover that he has no ground for his conclusion that you’re on thesame level. Look at the facts. You observe that water boils. You discoversomething in the constituent elements of water that causes it. You know morethan you did before. But he tells you, “No, you’re at the same place.” Then youask him, “What place do you want to go to? What do you regard as knowledge?”Prof. E: And then his answer would be that he wants a mystic apprehension of“necessity,” which he hasn’t yet received. All he has is “contingent” facts.AR: Yes. And you ask him what does he regard the facts of reality as: anecessity or a contingency? He’ll say, “Of course it’s a contingency, becauseGod made it this way, and he could have made it another.” And you say,“Good-bye.”Prof. F: But I am not clear why it is a significant step when one goes from themacroscopic phenomenon, boiling, to the molecular level. Why does one then say,“Aha! Now, within our present context of knowledge, we’ve made a satisfactoryadvance.”AR: Let’s ask something wider: what is knowledge? And what is study, what isobservation? It’s the discovery of properties in the nature of certain objects,existents, entities. All knowledge consists of learning more and more about thenature—the properties and characteristics—of given objects. So first you seeonly water—just that. Then you observe that it boils at a certain point. Yourknowledge is advanced. You know more about water than you did when you onlyobserved it in a lake. Then you discover such a thing as molecules, then youdiscover the molecular structure of water. Your knowledge about what water is isstill greater. Now you observe what happens to those molecules when you apply acertain amount of energy. Your knowledge is still greater. If it isn’t, what doyou mean by knowledge?Prof. F: Both you and your positivist opponents would agree that the knowledgeis greater. But they would then raise the question of whether one has to go afurther step or not—or why one should have made this step in the first place.Why does the breaking of the macroscopic down into the molecular constitute asignificant step, whereas the addition of some other type of knowledge—AR : Such as?Prof. F: Such as the knowledge of, say, the shape of the water at present, orthe electrical charges involved.AR: All that is knowledge. The knowledge of anything that can happen towater—what temperature it will freeze at, how it reflects light—anycharacteristic of a given object of study is knowledge. If you can establishthat this characteristic pertains to water, you have learned something new aboutwater.But if the problem here involves the issue of necessity vs. contingency, thenit’s a prescientific problem, a strictly philosophical problem. What do you meanby “necessity”? By “necessity,” we mean that things are a certain way and had tobe. I would maintain that the statement “Things are,” when referring tonon-man-made occurrences, is the synonym of “They had to be.” Because unless westart with the premise of an arbitrary God who creates nature, what is had tobe. We have to drop any mystical premise and keep the full context in mind.Then, aside from human action, what things are is what they had to be.The alternative of what “had to be” versus what “didn’t have to be” doesn’tapply metaphysically. It applies only to the realm of human action and humanchoice. For instance, will you wear a gray suit or a blue suit? That’s up toyou. You didn’t have to wear either one. Let’s assume you have only one suit.Even then you can’t say you had to wear it. You chose to wear it rather than benaked. Anything pertaining to actions open to human choice raises the question:“Is it necessary or is it volitional?” But in regard to facts which aremetaphysical—that is, not created by a human action—there is no such thing asnecessity—or, the fact of existence is the necessity.Prof. A: I think that was exactly my problem. I was assuming that the fact thata certain entity had always done a certain thing had no significance initself—that it could be otherwise tomorrow. But actually, something would actdifferently tomorrow only if a new factor entered in.AR: Yes.Prof. A: And by going to the molecular level, you tend to exclude any newfactor; you have more awareness of the mechanism operating, so you have moreknowledge of what is going to affect it and what isn’t; you understand what theprocess is that’s happening. I was assuming exactly what you were saying, thatthe fact that the energy required was so-and-so today, might change tomorrow,because of God knows what. So the answer lies in the point that necessity isjust identity.AR: Exactly.Prof. C: On this issue of boiling water and finding out that it must boilbecause of understanding its molecular structure: isn’t it related in some wayto the issue of unit-economy in concepts? Because in theory-formation oneattempts to condense a vast amount of knowledge into a smaller and smallernumber of principles. And when one is able to explain the boiling of water interms of the electrons and protons, not only does one explain boiling asnecessary from these few facts, but also one explains a vast number of othercharacteristics, properties, and set of behaviors for water and a whole scad ofother substances.AR: Oh yes.Prof. C: So when you go to that level, you have widened your knowledge to a muchlarger scope by integrating the data to a few simple laws, such as, in thiscase, the properties of the electrons.AR: You mean, it is also applicable to more than water, and if you discover howthe molecules of water react to heat, you then open the way to discoveriesconcerning how other elements react to heat, and you learn a great deal aboutother elements that way.Prof. C: Right.AR: Oh, of course.Prof. C: So the objection of the logical positivist would be valid only if onelearned nothing else relating water at the molecular level to other substances.Then one would say one has additional knowledge, but one doesn’t have a morefundamental knowledge.AR: No, the objection wouldn’t be valid even then. To begin with, thesupposition is impossible. Everything that you discover about one kind ofsubject or element opens the way for the same type of inquiry and discoveryabout other elements.But let’s assume for a moment that it had no other applications. Even then, youlearn something about water and how to handle it and what you can obtain fromit. If you discover that its molecules move in a certain way and that causesboiling, this can lead you to discover other things you can do with water, suchas what happens under a deep freeze or what happens with liquid oxygen—which isall derived from the same type of knowledge, from the same category of science.And don’t forget—it is important here—what the purpose of knowledge is. Thepurpose is for you to deal with that which you are studying. And if you discoverwhy water boils, you will know something more and will be able to do more thingswith water than the primitive man who knows only that if he holds it over fire acertain length of time it will boil. By discovering such issues as temperatureand molecular structure, you have made yourself infinitely more capable ofdealing with water and using it for your purposes than the primitive man whoonly made the first observation.040 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_040_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART FIVEEarly Novels and PoliticsEDITOR’S NOTE: Although AR is widely known as a champion of individualism andcapitalism, political themes were her primary concern only in her early works.Her focus changed in the 1930s when she concluded that politics rests on ethicsand, ultimately, on basic philosophy.Anthem, a novelette published in 1938, is the story of a future collectivistsociety in which the word “I” has been lost-and of the individual whorediscovers it.The first excerpt from Anthem presents the young hero on the brink of ascientific invention. The second passage, much later in time, shows the herooffering his invention to the Council of Scholars. The final excerpt is thefirst three paragraphs of the climactic Chapter Eleven."},{"pageContent":"1. The Individual vs. the StateANTHEMIT IS A SIN TO WRITE THIS. It is a sin to think words no others think and to putthem down upon a paper no others are to see. It is base and evil. It is as if wewere speaking alone to no ears but our own. And we know well that there is notransgression blacker than to do or think alone. We have broken the laws. Thelaws say that men may not write unless the Council of Vocations bid them so. Maywe be forgiven! But this is not the only sin upon us. We have committed a greater crime, and forthis crime there is no name. What punishment awaits us if it be discovered weknow not, for no such crime has come in the memory of men and there are no lawsto provide for it. It is dark here. The flame of the candle stands still in the air. Nothing movesin this tunnel save our hand on the paper. We are alone here under the earth. Itis a fearful word, alone. The laws say that none among men may be alone, everand at any time, for this is the great transgression and the root of all evil.But we have broken many laws. And now there is nothing here save our one body,and it is strange to see only two legs stretched on the ground, and on the wallbefore us the shadow of our one head. The walls are cracked and water runs upon them in thin threads without sound,black and glistening as blood. We stole the candle from the larder of the Homeof the Street Sweepers. We shall be sentenced to ten years in the Palace ofCorrective Detention if it be discovered. But this matters not. It matters onlythat the light is precious and we should not waste it to write when we need itfor that work which is our crime. Nothing matters save the work, our secret, ourevil, our precious work. Still, we must also write, for—may the Council havemercy on us!—we wish to speak for once to no ears but our own. Our name is Equality 7-2521, as it is written on the iron bracelet which all menwear on their left wrists with their names upon it. We are twenty-one years old.We are six feet tall, and this is a burden, for there are not many men who aresix feet tall. Ever have the Teachers and the Leaders pointed to us and frownedand said: “There is evil in your bones, Equality 7-2521, for your body has grownbeyond the bodies of your brothers.” But we cannot change our bones nor ourbody. We were born with a curse. It has always driven us to thoughts which areforbidden. It has always given us wishes which men may not wish. We know that weare evil, but there is no will in us and no power to resist it. This is ourwonder and our secret fear, that we know and do not resist. We strive to be like all our brother men, for all men must be alike. Over theportals of the Palace of the World Council, there are words cut in the marble,which we repeat to ourselves whenever we are tempted:“We are one in all and all in one.There are no men but only the great WE,One, indivisible and forever.”We repeat this to ourselves, but it helps us not. These words were cut long ago. There is green mould in the grooves of theletters and yellow streaks on the marble, which come from more years than mencould count. And these words are the truth for they are written on the Palace ofthe World Council, and the World Council is the body of all truth. Thus has itbeen ever since the Great Rebirth, and farther back than that no memory canreach.041 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_041_r1.jpg]But we must never speak of the times before the Great Rebirth, else we aresentenced to three years in the Palace of Corrective Detention. It is only theOld Ones who whisper about it in the evenings, in the Home of the Useless. Theywhisper many strange things, of the towers which rose to the sky, in thoseUnmentionable Times, and of the wagons which moved without horses, and of thelights which burned without flame. But those times were evil. And those timespassed away, when men saw the Great Truth which is this: that all men are oneand that there is no will save the will of all men together. All men are good and wise. It is only we, Equality 7-2521, we alone who wereborn with a curse. For we are not like our brothers. And as we look back uponour life, we see that it has ever been thus and that it has brought us step bystep to our last, supreme transgression, our crime of crimes hidden here underthe ground. We remember the Home of Infants where we lived till we were five years old,together with all the children of the City who had been born in the same year.The sleeping halls there were white and clean and bare of all things save onehundred beds. We were just like all our brothers then, save for the onetransgression: we fought with our brothers. There are few offenses blacker thanto fight with our brothers, at any age and for any cause whatsoever. The Councilof the Home told us so, and of all the children of that year, we were locked inthe cellar most often. When we were five years old, we were sent to the Home of the Students, wherethere are ten wards, for our ten years of learning. Men must learn till theyreach their fifteenth year. Then they go to work. In the Home of the Students wearose when the big bell rang in the tower and we went to our beds when it rangagain. Before we removed our garments, we stood in the great sleeping hall, andwe raised our right arms, and we said all together with the three Teachers atthe head:“We are nothing. Mankind is all. By the grace of our brothers are we allowed ourlives. We exist through, by and for our brothers who are the State. Amen.”042 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_042_r1.jpg]Then we slept. The sleeping halls were white and clean and bare of all thingssave one hundred beds. We, Equality 7-2521, were not happy in those years in the Home of the Students.It was not that the learning was too hard for us. It was that the learning wastoo easy. This is a great sin, to be born with a head which is too quick. It isnot good to be different from our brothers, but it is evil to be superior tothem. The Teachers told us so, and they frowned when they looked upon us. So we fought against this curse. We tried to forget our lessons, but we alwaysremembered. We tried not to understand what the Teachers taught, but we alwaysunderstood it before the Teachers had spoken. We looked upon Union 5-3992, whowere a pale boy with only half a brain, and we tried to say and do as they did,that we might be like them, like Union 5-3992, but somehow the Teachers knewthat we were not. And we were lashed more often than all the other children. The Teachers were just, for they had been appointed by the Councils, and theCouncils are the voice of all justice, for they are the voice of all men. And ifsometimes, in the secret darkness of our heart, we regret that which befell uson our fifteenth birthday, we know that it was through our own guilt. We hadbroken a law, for we had not paid heed to the words of our Teachers. TheTeachers had said to us all: “Dare not choose in your minds the work you would like to do when you leave theHome of the Students. You shall do that which the Council of Vocations shallprescribe for you. For the Council of Vocations knows in its great wisdom whereyou are needed by your brother men, better than you can know it in your unworthylittle minds. And if you are not needed by your brother men, there is no reasonfor you to burden the earth with your bodies.” We knew this well, in the years of our childhood, but our curse broke our will.We were guilty and we confess it here: we were guilty of the great Transgressionof Preference. We preferred some work and some lessons to the others. We did notlisten well to the history of all the Councils elected since the Great Rebirth.But we loved the Science of Things. We wished to know. We wished to know aboutall the things which make the earth around us. We asked so many questions thatthe Teachers forbade it. We think that there are mysteries in the sky and under the water and in theplants which grow. But the Council of Scholars has said that there are nomysteries, and the Council of Scholars knows all things. And we learned muchfrom our Teachers. We learned that the earth is flat and that the sun revolvesaround it, which causes the day and the night. We learned the names of all thewinds which blow over the seas and push the sails of our great ships. We learnedhow to bleed men to cure them of all ailments. We loved the Science of Things. And in the darkness, in the secret hour, when weawoke in the night and there were no brothers around us, but only their shapesin the beds and their snores, we closed our eyes, and we held our lips shut, andwe stopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers see or hear orguess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars whenour time would come. All the great modern inventions come from the Home of the Scholars, such as thenewest one, which we found only a hundred years ago, of how to make candles fromwax and string; also, how to make glass, which is put in our windows to protectus from the rain. To find these things, the Scholars must study the earth andlearn from the rivers, from the sands, from the winds and the rocks. And if wewent to the Home of the Scholars, we could learn from these also. We could askquestions of these, for they do not forbid questions. And questions give us no rest. We know not why our curse makes us seek we knownot what, ever and ever. But we cannot resist it. It whispers to us that thereare great things on this earth of ours, and that we can know them if we try, andthat we must know them. We ask, why must we know, but it has no answer to giveus. We must know that we may know. So we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars. We wished it so much thatour hands trembled under the blankets in the night, and we bit our arm to stopthat other pain which we could not endure. It was evil and we dared not face ourbrothers in the morning. For men may wish nothing for themselves. And we werepunished when the Council of Vocations came to give us our life Mandates whichtell those who reach their fifteenth year what their work is to be for the restof their days. The Council of Vocations came on the first day of spring, and they sat in thegreat hall. And we who were fifteen and all the Teachers came into the greathall. And the Council of Vocations sat on a high dais, and they had but twowords to speak to each of the Students. They called the Students’ names, andwhen the Students stepped before them, one after another, the Council said:“Carpenter” or “Doctor” or “Cook” or “Leader.” Then each Student raised theirright arm and said: “The will of our brothers be done.” Now if the Council has said “Carpenter” or “Cook,” the Students so assigned goto work and they do not study any further. But if the Council has said “Leader,”then those Students go into the Home of the Leaders, which is the greatest housein the City, for it has three stories. And there they study for many years, sothat they may become candidates and be elected to the City Council and the StateCouncil and the World Council—by a free and general vote of all men. But wewished not to be a Leader, even though it is a great honor. We wished to be aScholar. So we waited our turn in the great hall and then we heard the Council ofVocations call our name: “Equality 7-2521.” We walked to the dais, and our legsdid not tremble, and we looked up at the Council. There were five members of theCouncil, three of the male gender and two of the female. Their hair was whiteand their faces were cracked as the clay of a dry river bed. They were old. Theyseemed older than the marble of the Temple of the World Council. They sat beforeus and they did not move. And we saw no breath to stir the folds of their whitetogas. But we knew that they were alive, for a finger of the hand of the oldestrose, pointed to us, and fell down again. This was the only thing which moved,for the lips of the oldest did not move as they said: “Street Sweeper.” We felt the cords of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher to look uponthe faces of the Council, and we were happy. We knew we had been guilty, but nowwe had a way to atone for it. We would accept our Life Mandate, and we wouldwork for our brothers, gladly and willingly, and we would erase our sin againstthem, which they did not know, but we knew. So we were happy, and proud ofourselves and of our victory over ourselves. We raised our right arm and wespoke, and our voice was the clearest, the steadiest voice in the hall that day,and we said:“The will of our brothers be done.” And we looked straight into the eyes of the Council, but their eyes were as coldblue glass buttons. So we went into the Home of the Street Sweepers. It is a grey house on a narrowstreet. There is a sundial in its courtyard, by which the Council of the Homecan tell the hours of the day and when to ring the bell. When the bell rings, weall arise from our beds. The sky is green and cold in our windows to the east.The shadow on the sundial marks off a half-hour while we dress and eat ourbreakfast in the dining hall, where there are five long tables with twenty clayplates and twenty clay cups on each table. Then we go to work in the streets ofthe City, with our brooms and our rakes. In five hours, when the sun is high, wereturn to the Home and we eat our midday meal, for which one-half hour isallowed. Then we go to work again. In five hours, the shadows are blue on thepavements, and the sky is blue with a deep brightness which is not bright. Wecome back to have our dinner, which lasts one hour. Then the bell rings and wewalk in a straight column to one of the City Halls, for the Social Meeting.Other columns of men arrive from the Homes of the different Trades. The candlesare lit, and the Councils of the different Homes stand in a pulpit, and theyspeak to us of our duties and of our brother men. Then visiting Leaders mountthe pulpit and they read to us the speeches which were made in the City Councilthat day, for the City Council represents all men and all men must know. Then wesing hymns, the Hymn of Brotherhood, and the Hymn of Equality, and the Hymn ofthe Collective Spirit. The sky is a soggy purple when we return to the Home.Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to the City Theatre forthree hours of Social Recreation. There a play is shown upon the stage, with twogreat choruses from the Home of the Actors, which speak and answer all together,in two great voices. The plays are about toil and how good it is. Then we walkback to the Home in a straight column. The sky is like a black sieve pierced bysilver drops that tremble, ready to burst through. The moths beat against thestreet lanterns. We go to our beds and we sleep, till the bell rings again. Thesleeping halls are white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds. Thus we lived each day of four years, until two springs ago when our crimehappened. Thus must all men live until they are forty. At forty, they are wornout. At forty, they are sent to the Home of the Useless, where the Old Oneslive. The Old Ones do not work, for the State takes care of them. They sit inthe sun in summer and they sit by the fire in winter. They do not speak often,for they are weary. The Old Ones know that they are soon to die. When a miraclehappens and some live to be forty-five, they are the Ancient Ones, and childrenstare at them when passing by the Home of the Useless. Such is to be our life,as that of all our brothers and of the brothers who came before us. Such would have been our life, had we not committed our crime which changed allthings for us. And it was our curse which drove us to our crime. We had been agood Street Sweeper and like all our brother Street Sweepers, save for ourcursed wish to know. We looked too long at the stars at night, and at the treesand the earth. And when we cleaned the yard of the Home of the Scholars, wegathered the glass vials, the pieces of metal, the dried bones which they haddiscarded. We wished to keep these things to study them, but we had no place tohide them. So we carried them to the City Cesspool. And then we made thediscovery. [...]043 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_043_r1.jpg]IT IS DARK HERE IN THE FOREST. The leaves rustle over our head, black againstthe last gold of the sky. The moss is soft and warm. We shall sleep on this mossfor many nights, till the beasts of the forest come to tear our body. We have nobed now, save the moss, and no future, save the beasts. We are old now, yet we were young this morning, when we carried our glass boxthrough the streets of the City to the Home of the Scholars. No men stopped us,for there were none about from the Palace of Corrective Detention, and theothers knew nothing. No men stopped us at the gate. We walked through emptypassages and into the great hall where the World Council of Scholars sat insolemn meeting. We saw nothing as we entered, save the sky in the great windows, blue andglowing. Then we saw the Scholars who sat around a long table; they were asshapeless clouds huddled at the rise of the great sky. There were men whosefamous names we knew, and others from distant lands whose names we had notheard. We saw a great painting on the wall over their heads, of the twentyillustrious men who had invented the candle. All the heads of the Council turned to us as we entered. These great and wise ofthe earth did not know what to think of us, and they looked upon us with wonderand curiosity, as if we were a miracle. It is true that our tunic was torn andstained with brown stains which had been blood. We raised our right arm and wesaid: “Our greeting to you, our honored brothers of the World Council of Scholars!” The Collective 0-0009, the oldest and wisest of the Council, spoke and asked: “Who are you, our brother? For you do not look like a Scholar.” “Our name is Equality 7-2521,” we answered, “and we are a Street Sweeper of thisCity.” Then it was as if a great wind had stricken the hall, for all the Scholars spokeat once, and they were angry and frightened. “A Street Sweeper! A Street Sweeper walking in upon the World Council ofScholars! It is not to be believed! It is against all the rules and all thelaws!” But we knew how to stop them. “Our brothers!” we said. “We matter not, nor our transgression. It is only ourbrother men who matter. Give no thought to us, for we are nothing, but listen toour words, for we bring you a gift such as has never been brought to men. Listento us, for we hold the future of mankind in our hands.” Then they listened. We placed our glass box upon the table before them. We spoke of it, and of ourlong quest, and of our tunnel, and of our escape from the Palace of CorrectiveDetention. Not a hand moved in that hall, as we spoke, nor an eye. Then we putthe wires to the box, and they all bent forward and sat still, watching. And westood still, our eyes upon the wire. And slowly, slowly as a flush of blood, ared flame trembled in the wire. Then the wire glowed. But terror struck the men of the Council. They leapt to their feet, they ranfrom the table, and they stood pressed against the wall, huddled together,seeking the warmth of one another’s bodies to give them courage. We looked upon them and we laughed and said: “Fear nothing, our brothers. There is a great power in these wires, but thispower is tamed. It is yours. We give it to you.” Still they would not move. “We give you the power of the sky!” we cried. “We give you the key to the earth!Take it, and let us be one of you, the humblest among you. Let us all worktogether, and harness this power, and make it ease the toil of men. Let us throwaway our candles and our torches. Let us flood our cities with light. Let usbring a new light to men!” But they looked upon us, and suddenly we were afraid. For their eyes were still,and small, and evil. “Our brothers!” we cried. “Have you nothing to say to us?” Then Collective 0-0009 moved forward. They moved to the table and the othersfollowed.“Yes,” spoke Collective 0-0009, “we have much to say to you.” The sound of their voice brought silence to the hall and to the beat of ourheart. “Yes,” said Collective 0-0009, “we have much to say to a wretch who have brokenall the laws and who boast of their infamy! How dared you think that your mindheld greater wisdom than the minds of your brothers? And if the Councils haddecreed that you should be a Street Sweeper, how dared you think that you couldbe of greater use to men than in sweeping the streets?” “How dared you, gutter cleaner,” spoke Fraternity 9-3452, “to hold yourself asone alone and with the thoughts of the one and not of the many?” “You shall be burned at the stake,” said Democracy 4-6998. “No, they shall be lashed,” said Unanimity 7-3304, “till there is nothing leftunder the lashes.” “No,” said Collective 0-0009, “we cannot decide upon this, our brothers. No suchcrime has ever been committed, and it is not for us to judge. Nor for any smallCouncil. We shall deliver this creature to the World Council itself and lettheir will be done.” We looked upon them and we pleaded: “Our brothers! You are right. Let the will of the Council be done upon our body.We do not care. But the light? What will you do with the light?” Collective 0-0009 looked upon us, and they smiled. “So you think that you have found a new power,” said Collective 0-0009. “Do allyour brothers think that?” “No,” we answered. “What is not thought by all men cannot be true,” said Collective 0-0009.“You have worked on this alone?” asked International 1-5537. “Yes,” we answered. “What is not done collectively cannot be good,” said International 1-5537. “Many men in the Homes of the Scholars have had strange new ideas in the past,”said Solidarity 8-1164, “but when the majority of their brother Scholars votedagainst them, they abandoned their ideas, as all men must.” “This box is useless,” said Alliance 6-7349. “Should it be what they claim of it,” said Harmony 9-2642, “then it would bringruin to the Department of Candles. The Candle is a great boon to mankind, asapproved by all men. Therefore it cannot be destroyed by the whim of one.” “This would wreck the Plans of the World Council,” said Unanimity 2-9913, “andwithout the Plans of the World Council the sun cannot rise. It took fifty yearsto secure the approval of all the Councils for the Candle, and to decide uponthe number needed, and to re-fit the Plans so as to make candles instead oftorches. This touched upon thousands and thousands of men working in scores ofStates. We cannot alter the Plans again so soon.” “And if this should lighten the toil of men,” said Similarity 5-0306, “then itis a great evil, for men have no cause to exist save in toiling for other men.” Then Collective 0-0009 rose and pointed at our box. “This thing,” they said, “must be destroyed.” And all the others cried as one: “It must be destroyed!”Then we leapt to the table. We seized our box, we shoved them aside, and we ran to the window. We turned andwe looked at them for the last time, and a rage, such as it is not fit forhumans to know, choked our voice in our throat. “You fools!” we cried. “You fools! You thrice-damned fools!” We swung our fist through the windowpane, and we leapt out in a ringing rain ofglass. We fell, but we never let the box fall from our hands. Then we ran. We ranblindly, and men and houses streaked past us in a torrent without shape. And theroad seemed not to be flat before us, but as if it were leaping up to meet us,and we waited for the earth to rise and strike us in the face. But we ran. Weknew not where we were going. We knew only that we must run, run to the end ofthe world, to the end of our days. Then we knew suddenly that we were lying on a soft earth and that we hadstopped. Trees taller than we had ever seen before stood over us in a greatsilence. Then we knew. We were in the Uncharted Forest. We had not thought ofcoming here, but our legs had carried our wisdom, and our legs had brought us tothe Uncharted Forest against our will. Our glass box lay beside us. We crawled to it, we fell upon it, our face in ourarms, and we lay still. We lay thus for a long time. Then we rose, we took our box and walked on intothe forest. It mattered not where we went. We knew that men would not follow us, for theynever enter the Uncharted Forest. We had nothing to fear from them. The forestdisposes of its own victims. This gave us no fear either. Only we wished to beaway, away from the City and from the air that touches upon the air of the City.So we walked on, our box in our arms, our heart empty.We are doomed. Whatever days are left to us, we shall spend them alone. And wehave heard of the corruption to be found in solitude. We have torn ourselvesfrom the truth which is our brother men, and there is no road back for us, andno redemption. We know these things, but we do not care. We care for nothing on earth. We aretired. Only the glass box in our arms is like a living heart that gives us strength. Wehave lied to ourselves. We have not built this box for the good of our brothers.We built it for its own sake. It is above all our brothers to us, and its truthabove their truth. Why wonder about this? We have not many days to live. We arewalking to the fangs awaiting us somewhere among the great, silent trees. Thereis not a thing behind us to regret. [...]044 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_044_r1.jpg]I AM. I THINK. I WILL. My hands... My spirit ... My sky... My forest ... This earth of mine.... What must I say besides? These are the words. This is the answer. I stand here on the summit of the mountain. I lift my head and I spread my arms.This, my body and spirit, this is the end of the quest. I wished to know themeaning of things. I am the meaning. I wished to find a warrant for being. Ineed no warrant for being, and no word of sanction upon my being. I am thewarrant and the sanction.045 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_045_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: The theme of We the Living, AR’s first novel, published in 1936,is the individual versus the state. Set during the Communist Revolution, thestory shows how dictatorship—any dictatorship—suffocates human life.The following selection, from the middle of the novel, features the heroine,Kira Argounova; Leo Kovalensky, the man she loves; and Andrei Taganov, anofficer of the Soviet secret police who loves her.Kira is studying at the Technological Institute to be a builder; Leo is studyinghistory and philosophy at Petrograd State University. Kira and Leo are both“bourgeois”: her father’s business has been confiscated by the Soviets; hisfather was an admiral who had fought for the Czar. Andrei, of course, is pure“proletarian.”WE THE LIVINGThe PurgeAT FIRST there were whispers.Students gathered in groups in dark corners and jerked their heads nervously atevery approaching newcomer, and in their whispers one heard the words: “ThePurge.”In lines at co-operatives and in tramways people asked: “Have you heard aboutthe Purge?”In the columns of Pravda there appeared many mentions of the deplorable state ofRed colleges and of the coming Purge.And then, at the end of the winter semester, in the Technological Institute, inthe University and in all the institutes of higher education, there appeared alarge notice with huge letters in red pencil:THE PURGE The notice directed all students to call at the office, receive questionnaires,fill them out promptly, have their Upravdom certify to the truth of the answersand return them to the Purging Committee. The schools of the Union of SocialistSoviet Republics were to be cleaned of all socially undesirable persons. Thosefound socially undesirable were to be expelled, never to be admitted to anycollege again.Newspapers roared over the country like trumpets: “Science is a weapon of theclass struggle! Proletarian schools are for the Proletariat! We shall noteducate our class enemies!”There were those who were careful not to let these trumpets be heard too loudlyacross the border.Kira received her questionnaire at the Institute, and Leo—his at the University.They sat silently at their dinner table, filling out the answers. They did noteach much dinner that night. When they signed the questionnaires, they knew theyhad signed the death warrant of their future; but they did not say it aloud andthey did not look at each other.The main questions were: Who were your parents?What was your father’s occupation prior to the year 1917?What was your father’s occupation from the year 1917 to the year 1921?What is your father’s occupation now?What is your mother’s occupation?What did you do during the civil war?What did your father do during the civil war?Are you a Trade Union member?Are you a member of the All-Union Communist Party? Any attempt to give a false answer was futile; the answers were to beinvestigated by the Purging Committee and the G.P.U. A false answer was to bepunished by arrest, imprisonment or any penalty up to the supreme one.Kira’s hand trembled a little when she handed to the Purge Committee thequestionnaire that bore the answer:What was your father’s occupation prior to the year 1917? Owner of the ArgounovTextile Factory.What awaited those who were to be expelled, no one dared to think; no onementioned it; the questionnaires were turned in and the students waited for acall from the committee, waited silently, nerves tense as wires. In the longcorridors of the colleges, where the troubled stream of students clotted intorestless clusters, they whispered that one’s “social origin” was mostimportant—that if you were of “bourgeois descent,” you didn’t have a chance—thatif your parents had been wealthy, you were still a “class enemy,” even thoughyou were starving—and that you must try, if you could, at the price of yourimmortal soul, if you had one, to prove your “origin from the workbench or theplough.” There were more leather jackets, and red kerchiefs, and sunflower-seedshells in the college corridors, and jokes about: “My parents? Why, they were apeasant woman and two workers.”It was spring again, and melting snow drilled the sidewalks, and blue hyacinthswere sold on street corners. But those who were young had no thought left forspring and those who still thought were not young any longer.Kira Argounova, head high, stood before the Purge Committee of the TechnologicalInstitute. At the table, among the men of the committee whom she did not know,sat three persons she knew: Comrade Sonia, Pavel Syerov, Andrei Taganov.It was Pavel Syerov who did most of the questioning. Her questionnaire lay onthe table before him. “So, Citizen Argounova, your father was a factory owner?”“Yes.”“I see. And your mother? Did she work before the revolution?”“No.”“I see. Did you employ servants in your home?”“Yes.”“I see.”Comrade Sonia asked: “And you’ve never joined a Trade Union, Citizen Argounova?Didn’t find it desirable?”“I have never had the opportunity.”“I see.”Andrei Taganov listened. His face did not move. His eyes were cold, steady,impersonal, as if he had never seen Kira before. And suddenly she felt aninexplicable pity for him, for that immobility and what it hid, although heshowed not the slightest sign of what it hid.But when he asked her a question suddenly, even though his voice was hard andhis eyes empty, the question was a plea: “But you’ve always been in strictsympathy with the Soviet Government, Citizen Argounova, haven’t you?”She answered very softly: “Yes.”046 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_046_r1.jpg]Somewhere, around a lamp, late in the night, amid rustling papers, reports anddocuments, a committee was holding a conference.“Factory owners were the chief exploiters of the Proletariat.”“Worse than landowners.”“Most dangerous of class enemies.”“We are performing a great service to the cause of the Revolution and nopersonal feelings are to interfere with our duty.”“Order from Moscow—children of former factory owners are in the first categoryto be expelled.”A voice asked, weighing every word: “Any exceptions to that rule, ComradeTaganov?”He stood by a window, his hands clasped behind his back. He answered : “None.”047 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_047_r1.jpg]The names of those expelled were typewritten on a long sheet of paper and postedon a blackboard in the office of the Technological Institute.Kira had expected it. But when she saw the name on the list: “Argounova, Kira,”she closed her eyes and looked again and read the long list carefully, to makesure.Then she noticed that her brief case was open; she clasped the catch carefully;she looked at the hole in her glove and stuck her finger out, trying to see howfar it would go, and twisted an unraveled thread into a little snake and watchedit uncoil.Then she felt that someone was watching her. She turned. Andrei stood alone in awindow niche. He was looking at her, but he did not move forward, he did not saya word, he did not incline his head in greeting. She knew what he feared, whathe hoped, what he was waiting for. She walked to him, and looked up at him, andextended her hand with the same trusting smile he had known on the same younglips, only the lips trembled a little.“It’s all right, Andrei. I know you couldn’t help it.”She had not expected the gratitude, a gratitude like pain, in his low voice whenhe answered: “I’d give you my place—if I could.”“Oh, it’s all right.... Well ... I guess I won’t be a builder after all.... Iguess I won’t build any aluminum bridges.” She tried to laugh. “It’s all right,because everybody always told me one can’t build a bridge of aluminum anyway.”She noticed that it was harder for him to smile than for her. “And Andrei,” shesaid softly, knowing that he did not dare to ask it, “this doesn’t mean that wewon’t see each other any more, does it?”He took her hand in both of his. “It doesn’t, Kira, if...”“Well, then, it doesn’t. Give me your phone number and address, so I can callyou, because we ... we won’t meet here ... any more. We’re such good friendsthat—isn’t it funny?—I’ve never even known your address. All’s for the best.Maybe...maybe we’ll be better friends now.”048 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_048_r1.jpg]When she came home, Leo was sprawled across the bed, and he didn’t get up. Helooked at her and laughed. He laughed dryly, monotonously, senselessly.She stood still, looking at him.“Thrown out?” he asked, rising on a wavering elbow, his hair falling over hisface. “Don’t have to tell me. I know. You’re kicked out. Like a dog. So am I.Like two dogs. Congratulations, Kira Alexandrovna. Hearty proletariancongratulations!”“Leo, you’ve... you’ve been drinking!”“Sure. To celebrate. All of us did. Dozens and dozens of us at the University. Atoast to the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.... Many toasts to the Dictatorshipof the Proletariat.... Don’t stare at me like that.... It’s a good old custom todrink at births, and weddings, and funerals.... Well, we weren’t born together,Comrade Argounova.... And we’ve never had a wedding, Comrade Argounova.... Butwe might yet see the other.... We might ... yet ... the other ... Kira....”She was on her knees by the bed, gathering to her breast a pale face with acontorted wound of a mouth, she was brushing damp hair off his forehead, she waswhispering: “Leo ... dearest ... you shouldn’t do that.... Now’s the time youshouldn’t.... We have to think clearly now....” She was whispering withoutconviction. “It’s not dangerous so long as we don’t give up.... You must takecare of yourself, Leo.... You must spare yourself....”His mouth spat out: “For what?” [...]049 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_049_r1.jpg]Because there was no future, they hung on to the present.There were days when Leo sat for hours reading a book, and hardly spoke to Kira,and when he spoke his smile held a bitter, endless contempt for himself, for theworld, for eternity.Once, she found him drunk, leaning against the table, staring intently at abroken glass on the floor.“Leo! Where did you get it?”“Borrowed it. Borrowed it from our dear neighbor Comrade Marisha. She always hasplenty.”“Leo, why do you?”“Why shouldn’t I? Why shouldn’t I? Who in this whole damn world can tell me whyI shouldn’t?”But there were days when a new calm suddenly cleared his eyes and his smile. Hewaited for Kira to come home from work and when she entered he drew her hastilyinto his arms. They could sit through an evening without a word, their presence,a glance, the pressure of a hand drugging them into security, making them forgetthe coming morning, all the coming mornings.Arm in arm, they walked through silent, luminous streets in the white nights ofspring. The sky was like dull glass glowing with a sunless radiance fromsomewhere beyond. The could look at each other, at the still, sleepless city, inthe strange, milky light. He pressed her arm close to his, and when they werealone on a long street dawn-bright and empty, he bent to kiss her.Kira’s steps were steady. There were too many questions ahead; but here, besideher, were the things that gave her certainty: his straight, tense body, hislong, thin hands, his haughty mouth with the arrogant smile that answered allquestions. And, sometimes, she felt pity for those countless nameless onessomewhere around them who, in a feverish quest, were searching for some answer,and in their search crushed others, perhaps even her; but she could not becrushed, for she had the answer. She did not wonder about the future. The futurewas Leo.050 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_050_r1.jpg]Leo was too pale and he was silent too often. The blue on his temples lookedlike veins in marble. He coughed, choking. He took cough medicine, which did nothelp, and refused to see a doctor.Kira saw Andrei frequently. She had asked Leo if he minded it. “Not at all,” hehad answered, “if he’s your friend. Onty—would you mind?—don’t bring him here.I’m not sure I can be polite ... to one of them.”She did not bring Andrei to the house. She telephoned him on Sundays and smiledcheerfully into the receiver: “Feel like seeing me, Andrei? Two o’clock—SummerGarden—the quay entrance.”They sat on a bench, with the oak leaves fighting the glare of the sun abovetheir heads, and they talked of philosophy. She smiled sometimes when sherealized that Andrei was the only one with whom she could think and talk aboutthoughts.They had no reason for meeting each other. Yet they met, and made dates to meetagain, and she felt strangely comfortable, and he laughed at her short summerdresses, and his laughter was strangely happy.Once, he invited her to spend a Sunday in the country. She had stayed in thecity all summer; she could not refuse. Leo had found a job for Sunday: breakingthe wooden bricks of pavements, with a gang repairing the streets. He did notobject to her excursion.In the country, she found a smooth sea sparkling in the sun; and a golden sandwind-pleated into faint, even waves; and the tall red candles of pines, theirconvulsed roots naked to the sand and wind, pine cones rolling to meet the seashells.Kira and Andrei had a swimming race, which she won. But when they raced down thebeach in their bathing suits, sand flying from under their heels, spurting sandand water at the peaceful Sunday tourists, Andrei won. He caught her and theyrolled down together, a whirl of legs, arms and mud, into the lunch basket of amatron who shrieked with terror. They disentangled themselves from each otherand sat there screaming with laughter. And when the matron struggled to herfeet, gathered her lunch and waddled away, grumbling something about “thisvulgar modern youth that can’t keep their love-affairs to themselves,” theylaughed louder.They had dinner in a dirty little country restaurant, and Kira spoke English tothe waiter who could not understand a word, but bowed low and stuttered andspilled water all over the table in his eagerness to serve the first comradeforeigner in their forgotten corner. When they were leaving, Andrei gave himtwice the price of their dinner. The waiter bowed to the ground, convinced thathe was dealing with genuine foreigners. Kira could not help looking a littlestartled. Andrei laughed when they went out: “Why not? Might as well make awaiter happy. I make more money than I can spend on myself anyway.”In the train, as it clattered into the evening and the smoke of the city, Andreiasked: “Kira, when will I see you again?”“I’ll call you.”“No. I want to know now.”“In a few days.”“No. I want a definite day.”“Well, then, Wednesday night?”“All right.”“After work, at five-thirty, at the Summer Garden.”“All right.”When she came home, she found Leo asleep in a chair, his hands dust-streaked,smears of dust on his damp, flushed face, his dark lashes blond with dust, hisbody limp with exhaustion.She washed his face and helped him to undress. He coughed.The two evenings that followed were long, furious arguments, but Leosurrendered: He promised to visit a doctor on Wednesday. [...]051 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_051_r1.jpg]Kira had had a restless day. Leo had promised to telephone her at the office andtell her the doctor’s diagnosis. He had not called. She telephoned him threetimes. There was no answer. On her way home, she remembered that it wasWednesday night and that she had a date with Andrei.She could not keep him waiting indefinitely at a public park gate. She woulddrop by the Summer Garden and tell him that she couldn’t stay. She reached theGarden on time.Andrei was not there. She looked up and down the darkening quay. She peered intothe trees and shadows of the garden. She waited. Twice, she asked a militia-manwhat time it was. She waited. She could not understand it.He did not come.When she finally went home, she had waited for an hour.She clutched her hands angrily in her pockets. She could not worry about Andreiwhen she thought of Leo, and the doctor, and of what she still had to hear. Shehurried up the stairs. She darted through Marisha’s room and flung the dooropen. On the davenport, her white coat trailing to the floor, Vava was claspedin Leo’s arms, their lips locked together.Kira stood looking at them calmly, an amazed question in her lifted eyebrows.They jumped up. Leo was not very steady. He had been drinking again. He stoodswaying, with his bitter, contemptuous smile.Vava’s face went a dark, purplish red. She opened her mouth, choking, without asound. And as no one said a word, she screamed suddenly into the silence: “Youthink it’s terrible, don’t you? Well, I think so too! It’s terrible, it’s vile!Only I don’t care! I don’t care what I do! I don’t care any more! I’m rotten?Well, I’m not the only one! Only I don’t care! I don’t care! I don’t care!”She burst into hysterical sobs and rushed out, slamming the door. The two othersdid not move.He sneered: “Well, say it.”She answered slowly: “I have nothing to say.”“Listen, you might as well get used to it. You might as well get used to it thatyou can’t have me. Because you can’t have me. You won’t have me. You won’t haveme long.”“Leo, what did the doctor say?”He laughed: “Plenty.”“What is it you have?”“Nothing. Not a thing.”“Leo!”“Not a thing—yet. But I’m going to have it. Just a few weeks longer. I’m goingto have it.”“What, Leo?”He swayed with a grand gesture: “Nothing much. Just—tuberculosis.”052 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_052_r1.jpg]The doctor asked: “Are you his wife?”Kira hesitated, then answered: “No.”The doctor said: “I see.” Then, he added: “Well, I suppose you have a right toknow it. Citizen Kovalensky is in a very bad condition. We call it incipienttuberculosis. It can still be stopped-now. In a few weeks—it will be too late.”“In a few weeks—he’ll have—tuberculosis?”“Tuberculosis is a serious disease, citizen. In Soviet Russia—it is a fataldisease. It is strongly advisable to prevent it. If you let it start—you willnot be likely to stop it.”“What ... does he need?”“Rest. Plenty of it. Sunshine. Fresh air. Food. Human food. He needs asanatorium for this coming winter. One more winter in Petrograd would be ascertain as a firing squad. You’ll have to send him south.”She did not answer; but the doctor smiled ironically, for he heard the answerwithout words and he looked at the patches on her shoes.“If that young man is dear to you,” he said, “send him south. If you have ahuman possibility—or an inhuman one—send him south.”053 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_053_r1.jpg]Kira was very calm when she walked home.When she came in, Leo was standing by the window. He turned slowly. His face wasso profoundly, serenely tranquil that he looked younger; he looked as if he hadhad his first night of rest; he asked quietly: “Where have you been, Kira?”“At the doctor’s.”“Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t want you to know all that.”“He told me.”“Kira, I’m sorry about last night. About that little fool. I hope you didn’tthink that I ...”“Of course, I didn’t. I understand.”“I think it’s because I was frightened. But I’m not—now. Everything seems somuch simpler—when there’s a limit set.... The thing to do now, Kira, is not totalk about it. Don’t let’s think about it. There’s nothing we can do—as thedoctor probably told you. We can still be together—for a while. When it becomescontagious—well...”She was watching him. Such was his manner of accepting his death sentence.She said, and her voice was hard: “Nonsense, Leo. You’re going south.”054 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_054_r1.jpg]In the first State hospital she visited, the official in charge told her: “Aplace in a sanatorium in the Crimea? He’s not a member of the Party? And he’snot a member of a Trade Union? And he’s not a State employee? You’re joking,citizen.”In the second hospital, the official said: “We have hundreds on our waitinglist, citizen. Trade Union members. Advanced cases.... No, we cannot evenregister him.”In the third hospital, the official refused to see her.There were lines to wait in, ghastly lines of deformed creatures, of scars, andslings, and crutches, and open sores, and green, mucous patches of eyes, andgrunts, and groans, and—over a line of the living—the smell of the morgue.There were State Medical headquarters to visit, long hours of waiting in dim,damp corridors that smelt of carbolic acid and soiled linen. There weresecretaries who forgot appointments, and assistants who said: “So sorry,citizen. Next, please”; there were young executives who were in a hurry, andattendants who groaned: “I tell you he’s gone, it’s after office hours, we gottaclose, you can’t sit here all night.”At the end of the first two weeks she learned, as firmly as if it were somemystic absolute, that if one had consumption one had to be a member of a TradeUnion and get a Trade Union despatchment to a Trade Union Sanatorium.There were officials to be seen, names mentioned, letters of recommendationoffered, begging for an exception. There were Trade Union heads to visit, wholistened to her plea with startled, ironic glances. Some laughed; some shrugged;some called their secretaries to escort the visitor out; one said he could andhe would, but he named a sum she could not earn in a year.She was firm, erect, and her voice did not tremble, and she was not afraid tobeg. It was her mission, her quest, her crusade.She wondered sometimes why the words: “But he’s going to die,” meant so littleto them, and the words: “But he’s not a registered worker,” meant so little toher, and why it seemed so hard to explain.She made Leo do his share of inquiries. He obeyed without arguing, withoutcomplaining, without hope.She tried everything she could. She asked Victor for help. Victor said withdignity: “My dear cousin, I want you to realize that my Party membership is asacred trust not to be used for purposes of personal advantage.”She asked Marisha. Marisha laughed. “With all our sanatoriums stuffed likeherring-barrels, and waiting lists till the next generation, and comrade workersrotting alive waiting—and here he’s not even sick yet! You don’t realizereality, Citizen Argounova.”She could not call on Andrei. Andrei had failed her.For several days after the date he had missed, she called on Lydia with the samequestion: “Has Andrei Taganov been here? Have you had any letters for me?”The first day, Lydia said: “No.” The second day, she giggled and wanted to knowwhat was this, a romance? and she’d tell Leo, and with Leo so handsome! and Kirainterrupted patiently: “Oh, stop this rubbish, Lydia! It’s important. Let meknow the minute you hear from him, will you?”Lydia did not hear from him.One evening, at the Dunaevs’, Kira asked Victor casually if he had seen AndreiTaganov at the Institute. “Sure,” said Victor, “he’s there every day.”She was hurt. She was angry. She was bewildered. What had she done? For thefirst time, she questioned her own behavior. Had she acted foolishly that Sundayin the country? She tried to remember every word, every gesture. She could findno fault. He had seemed happier than ever before. After a while, she decidedthat she must trust their friendship and give him a chance to explain.She telephoned him. She heard the old landlady’s voice yelling into the house:“Comrade Taganov!” with a positive inflection that implied his presence; therewas a long pause; the landlady returned and asked: “Who’s calling him?” andbefore she had pronounced the last syllable of her name, Kira heard the landladybarking: “He ain’t home!” and slamming her receiver.Kira slammed hers, too. She decided to forget Andrei Taganov055 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_055_r1.jpg]It took a month, but at the end of a month, she was convinced that the door ofthe State sanatoriums was locked to Leo and that she could not unlock it.There were private sanatoriums in the Crimea. Private sanatoriums cost money.She would get the money.She made an appointment to see Comrade Voronov and asked for an advance on hersalary, an advance of six months—just enough to start him off. Comrade Voronovsmiled faintly and asked her how she could be certain that she would be workingthere another month, let alone six.She called on Doctor Milovsky, Vava’s father, her wealthiest acquaintance, whosebank account had been celebrated by many envious whispers. Doctor Milovsky’sface got very red and his short, pudgy hands waved at Kira hysterically, as ifshooing off a ghost: “My dear little girl, why, my dear little girl, what onearth made you think that I was rich or something? Heh-heh. Very funny indeed. Acapitalist or something—heh-heh. Why, we’re just existing, from hand to mouth,living by my own toil like proletarians one would say, barely existing, as onewould say—that’s it—from hand to mouth.”She knew her parents had nothing. She asked if they could try to help. GalinaPetrovna cried.She asked Vasili Ivanovitch. He offered her his last possession—Maria Petrovna’sold fur jacket. The price of the jacket would not buy a ticket to the Crimea.She did not take it.She knew Leo would resent it, but she wrote to his aunt in Berlin. She said inher letter: “I am writing, because I love him so much—to you, because I thinkyou must love him a little.” No answer came.Through mysterious, stealthy whispers, more mysterious and stealthy than theG.P.U. who watched them sharply, she learned that there was private money to belent, secretly and on a high percentage, but there was. She learned a name andan address. She went to the booth of a private trader in a market, where a fatman bent down to her nervously across a counter loaded with red kerchiefs andcotton stockings. She whispered a name. She named a sum.“Business?” he breathed. “Speculation?”She knew it best to say yes. Well, he told her, it could be arranged. The rateswere twenty-five per cent a month. She nodded eagerly. What security did thecitizen have to offer? Security? Surely she knew they didn’t lend it on her goodlooks? Furs or diamonds would do; good furs and any kind of diamonds. She hadnothing to offer. The man turned away as if he had never spoken to her in hislife.On her way back to the tramway, through the narrow, muddy passages between themarket stalls, she stopped, startled; in a little prosperous-looking booth,behind a counter heavy with fresh bread loaves, smoked hams, yellow circles ofbutter, she saw a familiar face: a heavy red mouth under a short nose with wide,vertical nostrils. She remembered the train speculator of the Nikolaevskystation, with the fur-lined coat and the smell of carnation oil. He hadprogressed in life. He was smiling at the customers, from under a fringe ofsalami.On her way home, she remembered someone who had said: “I make more money than Ican spend on myself.” Did anything really matter now? She would go to theInstitute and try to see Andrei.She changed tramways for the Institute. She saw Andrei. She saw him coming downthe corridor and he was looking straight at her, so that her lips moved in asmile of greeting; but he turned abruptly and slammed the door of an auditoriumbehind him.She stood frozen to the spot for a long time.When she came home, Leo was standing in the middle of the room, a crumpled paperin his hand, his face distorted by anger.“So you would?” he cried. “So you’re meddling in my affairs now? So you’rewriting letters? Who asked you to write?”On the table, she saw an envelope with a German stamp. It was addressed to Leo.“What does she say, Leo?”“You want to know? You really want to know?”He threw the letter at her face.She remembered only the sentence: “There is no reason why you should expect anyhelp from us; the less reason since you are living with a brazen harlot who hasthe impudence to write to respectable people.”056 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_056_r1.jpg]On the first rainy day of autumn, a delegation from a Club of Textile WomenWorkers visited the “House of the Peasant.” Comrade Sonia was an honorary memberof the delegation. When she saw Kira at the filing cabinet in Comrade Bitiuk’soffice, Comrade Sonia roared with laughter: “Well, well, well! A loyal citizenlike Comrade Argounova in the Red ‘House of the Peasant’!”“What’s the matter, comrade?” Comrade Bitiuk inquired nervously, obsequiously.“What’s the matter?”“A joke,” roared Comrade Sonia, “a good joke!”Kira shrugged with resignation; she knew what to expect.When a reduction of staffs came to the “House of the Peasant” and she saw hername among those dismissed as “anti-social element,” she was not surprised. Itmade no difference now. She spent most of her last salary to buy eggs and milkfor Leo, which he would not touch.057 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_057_r1.jpg]In the daytime, Kira was calm, with the calm of an empty face, an empty heart, amind empty of all thoughts but one. She was not afraid: because she knew thatLeo had to go south, and he would go, and she could not doubt it, and so she hadnothing to fear.But there was the night.She felt his body, ice and moist, close to hers. She heard him coughing.Sometimes in his sleep, his head fell on her shoulder, and he lay there,trusting and helpless as a child, and his breathing was like a moan.She saw the red bubble on Maria Petrovna’s dying lips, and she heard herscreaming: “Kira! I want to live! I want to live!”She could feel Leo’s breath in hot, panting gasps on her neck.Then, she was not sure whether it was Maria Petrovna or Leo screaming when itwas too late: “Kira! I want to live! I want to live!”Was she going insane? It was so simple. She just needed money; a life, hislife—and money.“I make more money than I can spend on myself.”“Kira! I want to live! I want to live!”058 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_058_r1.jpg]She made one last attempt to get money.She was walking down a street slippery with autumn rain, yellow lights meltingon black sidewalks. The doctor had said every week counted; every day countednow. She saw a resplendent limousine stopping in the orange cube of light at atheater entrance. A man stepped out; his fur coat glistened like his automobilefenders. She stood in his path. Her voice was firm and clear:“Please! I want to speak to you. I need money. I don’t know you. I have nothingto offer you. I know it isn’t being done like this. But you’ll understand,because it’s so important. It’s to save a life.”The man stopped. He had never heard a plea that was a command. He asked,squinting one eye appraisingly: “How much do you need?”She told him.“What?” he gasped. “For one night? Why, your sisters don’t make that in a wholecareer!”He could not understand why the strange girl whirled around and ran across thestreet, straight through the puddles, as if he were going to run after her.059 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_059_r1.jpg]She made one last plea to the State.It took many weeks of calls, letters, introductions, secretaries and assistants,but she got an appointment with one of Petrograd’s most powerful officials. Shewas to see him in person, face to face. He could do it. Between him and thepower he could use stood only her ability to convince him.The official sat at his desk. A tall window rose behind him, admitting a narrowshaft of light, creating the atmosphere of a cathedral. Kira stood before him.She looked straight at him; her eyes were not hostile, nor pleading; they wereclear, trusting, serene; her voice was very calm, very simple, very young.“Comrade Commissar, you see, I love him. And he is sick. You know what sicknessis? It’s something strange that happens in your body and then you can’t stop it.And then he dies. And now his life—it depends on some words and a piece ofpaper—and it’s so simple when you just look at it as it is—it’s only somethingmade by us, ourselves, and perhaps we’re right, and perhaps we’re wrong, but thechance we’re taking on it is frightful, isn’t it? They won’t send him to asanatorium because they didn’t write his name on a piece of paper with manyother names and call it a membership in a Trade Union. It’s only ink, you know,and paper, and something we think. You can write it and tear it up, and write itagain. But the other—that which happens in one’s body—you can’t stop that. Youdon’t ask questions about that. Comrade Commissar, I know they are important,those things, money, and the Unions, and those papers, and all. And if one hasto sacrifice and suffer for them, I don’t mind. I don’t mind if I have to workevery hour of the day. I don’t mind if my dress is old—like this—don’t look atmy dress, Comrade Commissar, I know it’s ugly, but I don’t mind. Perhaps, Ihaven’t always understood you, and all those things, but I can be obedient andlearn. Only—only when it comes to life itself, Comrade Commissar, then we haveto be serious, don’t we? We can’t let those things take life. One signature ofyour hand—and he can go to a sanatorium, and he doesn’t have to die. ComradeCommissar, if we just think of things, calmly and simply—as they are—do you knowwhat death is? Do you know that death is—nothing at all, not at all, neveragain, never, no matter what we do? Don’t you see why he can’t die? I love him.We all have to suffer. We all have things we want, which are taken away from us.It’s all right. But—because we are living beings—there’s something in each ofus, something like the very heart of life condensed—and that should not betouched. You understand, don’t you? Well, he is that to me, and you can’t takehim from me, because you can’t let me stand here, and look at you, and talk, andbreathe, and move, and then tell me you’ll take him—we’re not insane, both ofus, are we, Comrade Commissar?”The Comrade Commissar said: “One hundred thousand workers died in the civil war.Why—in the face of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics—can’t one aristocratdie?”Kira walked home very slowly and looked at the dark city; she looked at theglistening pavements built for many thousands of old shoes; at the tramways formen to ride in; at the stone cubes into which men crawled at night; at theposters that cried of what men dreamed and of what men ate; and she wonderedwhether any of those thousands of eyes around her saw what she saw, and why ithad been given her to see.060 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_060_r1.jpg]Because:In a kitchen on the fifth floor, a woman bent over a smoking stove and stirredcabbage in a kettle, and the cabbage smelt, and the woman blinked, and groanedwith the pain in her back, and scratched her head with the spoon,Because:In a corner saloon, a man leaned against the bar and raised a foaming glass ofbeer, and the foam spilled over the floor and over his trousers, and he belchedand sang a gay song,Because:In a white bed, on white sheets stained with yellow, a child slept and sniveledin its sleep, its nose wet,Because:On a sack of flour in the basement, a man tore a woman’s pants off, and bit intoher throat, and they rolled, moaning, over the sacks of flour and potatoes,Because:In the silence of stone walls slowly dripping frozen dampness, a figure kneltbefore a gilded cross, and raised trembling arms in exaltation, and knocked apale forehead against a cold stone floor,Because:In the roar of machines whirling lightnings of steel and drops of burninggrease, men swung vigorous arms, and panted, heaving chests of musclesglistening with sweat, and made soap,Because:In a public bath, steam rose from brass pans, and red, gelatinous bodies shookscrubbing themselves with the soap, sighing and grunting, trying to scratchsteaming backs, and murky water and soap suds ran down the floor into the drain——Leo Kovalensky was sentenced to die.061 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_061_r1.jpg]It was her last chance and she had to take it.A modest house stood before her, on a modest street that lay deserted in thedarkness. An old landlady opened the door and looked at Kira suspiciously:Comrade Taganov did not receive women visitors. But she said nothing andshuffled, leading Kira down a corridor, then stopped, pointed at a door andshuffled away.Kira knocked.His voice said: “Come in.”She entered.He was sitting at his desk and he was about to rise, but he didn’t. He satlooking at her, and then rose very slowly, so slowly that she wondered how longshe stood there, at the door, while he was rising, his eyes never leaving her.Then, he said: “Good evening, Kira.”“Good evening, Andrei.”“Take your coat off.”She was suddenly frightened, uncomfortable, uncertain; she lost all the bitter,hostile assurance that had brought her here; obediently, she took off her coatand threw her hat on the bed. It was a large, bare room with whitewashed walls,a narrow iron bed, one desk, one chair, one chest of drawers, no pictures, noposters, but books, an ocean of books and papers and newspapers, running overthe desk, over the chest, over the floor.He said: “It’s cold tonight, isn’t it?”“It’s cold.”“Sit down.”She sat by the desk. He sat on the bed, his hands clasping his knees. She wishedhe would not look at her like that, every second of every long minute. But hesaid calmly: “How have you been, Kira? You look tired.”“I am a little tired.”“How is your job?”“It isn’t.”“What?”“Reduction of staffs.”“Oh, Kira, I’m sorry. I’ll get you another one.”“Thanks. But I don’t know whether I need one. How is your job?”“The G.PU.? I’ve been working hard. Searches, arrests. You still aren’t afraidof me, are you?”“No.”“I don’t like searches.”“Do you like arrests?”“I don’t mind—when it’s necessary.”They were silent, and then she said: “Andrei, if I make you uncomfortable —I’llgo.”“No! Don’t go. Please don’t go.” He tried to laugh. “Make me uncomfortable? Whatmakes you say that? I’m just ... just a little embarrassed ... this room of mine... it’s in no condition to receive such a guest.”“Oh, it’s a nice room. Big. Light.”“You see, I’m home so seldom, and when I am, I just have time to fall in bed,without noticing what’s around me.”“Oh.”They were silent.“How is your family, Kira?”“They are fine, thank you.”“I often see your cousin, Victor Dunaev, at the Institute. Do you like him?”“No.”“Neither do I.”They were silent.“Victor has joined the Party,” said Kira.“I voted against him. But most of them were eager to admit him.”“I’m glad you voted against him. He’s the kind of Party man I despise.”“What kind of Party man don’t you despise, Kira?”“Your kind, Andrei.”“Kira ...” It began as a sentence, but stopped on the first word.She said resolutely: “Andrei, what have I done?”He looked at her, and frowned, and looked aside, shaking his head slowly:“Nothing.” Then he asked suddenly: “Why did you come here?”“It’s been such a long time since I saw you last.”“Two months, day after tomorrow.”“Unless you saw me at the Institute three weeks ago.”“I saw you.”She waited, but he did not explain, and she tried to ignore it, her words almosta plea: “I came because I thought ... because I thought maybe you wanted to seeme.”“I didn’t want to see you.”She rose to her feet.“Don’t go, Kira!”“Andrei, I don’t understand!”He stood facing her. His voice was flat, harsh as an insult: “I didn’t want youto understand. I didn’t want you to know. But if you want to hear it—you’ll hearit. I never wanted to see you again. Because . . .” His voice was like a dullwhip. “Because I love you.”Her hands fell limply against the wall behind her. He went on: “Don’t say it. Iknow what you’re going to say. I’ve said it to myself again and again and again.I know every word. But it’s useless. I know I should be ashamed, and I am, butit’s useless. I know that you liked me, and trusted me, because we were friends.It was beautiful and rare, and you have every right to despise me.”She stood pressed to the wall, not moving.“When you came in, I thought ‘Send her away.’ But I knew that if you went away,I’d run after you. I thought ‘I won’t say a word.’ But I knew that you’d know itbefore you left. I love you. I know you’d think kindlier of me if I said that Ihate you.”She said nothing; she cringed against the wall, her eyes wide, her glanceholding no pity for him, but a plea for his pity.“You’re frightened? Do you see why I couldn’t face you? I knew what you felt forme and what you could never feel. I knew what you’d say, how your eyes wouldlook at me. When did it start? I don’t know. I knew only that it mustend—because I couldn’t stand it. To see you, and laugh with you, and talk of thefuture of humanity—and think only of when your hand would touch mine, of yourfeet in the sand, the little shadow on your throat, your skirt blowing in thewind. To discuss the meaning of life—and wonder if I could see the line of yourbreast in your open collar!”She whispered: “Andrei ... don’t....”It was not an admission of love, it was the confession of a crime: “Why am Itelling you all this? I don’t know. I’m not sure I’m really saying it to you.I’ve been crying it to myself so often, for such a long time! You shouldn’t havecome here. I’m not your friend. I don’t care if I hurt you. All you are to me isonly this: I want you.”She whispered: “Andrei . . . I didn’t know . . .”“I didn’t want you to know. I tried to stay away from you, to break it. Youdon’t know what it’s done to me. There was one search. There was a woman. Wearrested her. She rolled on the floor, in her nightgown, at my feet, crying formercy. I thought of you. I thought of you there, on the floor, in yournightgown, crying for pity as I have been crying to you so many months. I’d takeyou—and I wouldn’t care if it were the floor, and if those men stood looking.Afterward, perhaps I’d shoot you, and shoot myself—but I wouldn’t care—becauseit would be afterward. I thought I could arrest you—in the middle of thenight—and carry you wherever I wanted—and have you. I could do it, you know. Ilaughed at the woman and kicked her. My men stared at me—they had never seen medo that. They took the woman to jail—and I found an excuse to run away, to walkhome alone—thinking of you.... Don’t look at me like that. You don’t have to beafraid that I’d do it.... I have nothing to offer you. I cannot offer you mylife. My life is twenty-eight years of that for which you feel contempt. Andyou—you’re everything I’ve always expected to hate. But I want you. I’d giveeverything I have—everything I could ever have—Kira—for something you can’t giveme!”He saw her eyes open wide at a thought he could not guess. She breathed: “Whatdid you say, Andrei?”“I said, everything I have for something you can’t....”It was terror in her eyes, a terror of the thought she had seen for a second sovery clearly. She whispered, trembling: “Andrei ... I’d better go.... I’d bettergo now.”But he was looking at her fixedly, approaching her, asking in a voice suddenlyvery soft and low: “Or is it something you ... can ... Kira?”She was not thinking of him; she was not thinking of Leo; she was thinking ofMaria Petrovna and of the red bubble on dying lips. She was pressed to the wall,cornered, her ten fingers spread apart on the white plaster. His voice, his hopewere driving her on. Her body rose slowly against the wall, to her full height,higher, on tiptoe, her head thrown back, so that her throat was level with hismouth when she threw at him:“I can! I love you.”She wondered how strange it was to feel a man’s lips that were not Leo’s.She was saying: “Yes ... for a long time ... but I didn’t know that you, too...” and she felt his hands and his mouth, and she wondered whether this was joyor torture to him and how strong his arms were. She hoped it would be quick....062 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_062_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: This scene, late in the novel, shows us the type of scum who riseto the top under collectivism. Syerov is a ranking Soviet bureaucrat; Morozov, aprivate speculator and influence-purchaser The two are engaged in a large-scalescheme to steal supplies from the state. Stepan Timoshenko is a leader in theRed Baltfleet. He is a veteran Communist fighter—once idealistic about the newgovernment, now bitterly disillusioned.THE PROFITEERS ON COLLECTIVISMPavel Syerov had a drink before he came to his office. He had another drink inthe afternoon. He had telephoned Morozov and a voice he knew to be Morozov’s hadtold him that the Citizen Morozov was not at home. He paced up and down hisoffice and smashed an inkstand. He found a misspelled word in a letter he haddictated, and threw the letter, crumpled into a twisted ball, at his secretary’sface. He telephoned Morozov and got no answer. A woman telephoned him and hersoft, lisping voice said sweetly, insistently: “But, Pavlusha darling, youpromised me that bracelet!” A speculator brought a bracelet tied in the cornerof a dirty handkerchief, and refused to leave it without the full amount incash. Syerov telephoned Morozov at the Food Trust; a secretary demanded to knowwho was calling; Syerov slammed the receiver down without answering. He roaredat a ragged applicant for a job that he would turn him over to the G.P.U. andordered his secretary to throw out all those waiting to see him. He left theoffice an hour earlier than usual and slammed the door behind him.He walked past Morozov’s house on his way home and hesitated, but saw amilitia-man on the corner and did not enter.At dinner—which had been sent from a communal kitchen two blocks away, and wascold, with grease floating over the cabbage soup—Comrade Sonia said: “Really,Pavel, I’ve got to have a fur coat. I can’t allow myself to catch a cold—youknow—for the child’s sake. And no rabbit fur, either. I know you can afford it.Oh, I’m not saying anything about anyone’s little activities, but I’m justkeeping my eyes open.”He threw his napkin into the soup and left the table without eating.He called Morozov’s house and let the telephone ring for five minutes. There wasno answer. He sat on the bed and emptied a bottle of vodka. Comrade Sonia leftfor a meeting of the Teachers’ Council of an Evening School for Illiterate WomenHouse Workers. He emptied a second bottle.Then he rose resolutely, swaying a little, pulled his belt tight across his furjacket and went to Morozov’s house.He rang three times. There was no answer. He kept his finger on the bell button,leaning indifferently against the wall. He heard no sound behind the door, buthe heard steps rising up the stairs and he flung himself into the darkest cornerof the landing. The steps died on the floor below and he heard a door openingand closing. He could not let himself be seen waiting there, he remembereddimly. He reached for his notebook and wrote, pressing the notebook to the wall,in the light of a street lamp outside: MOROZOV, YOU GOD-DAMN BASTARD! If you don’t come across with what’s due me before tomorrow morning, you’ll eatbreakfast at the G.P.U., and you know what that means.Affectionately,PAVEL SYEROV. He folded the note and slipped it under the door.Fifteen minutes later, Morozov stepped noiselessly out of his bathroom andtiptoed to the lobby. He listened nervously, but heard no sound on thestair-landing. Then he noticed the faint blur of white in the darkness, on thefloor.He picked up the note and read it, bending under the dining-room lamp. His facelooked gray.The telephone rang. He shuddered, frozen to the spot, as if the eyes somewherebehind that ringing bell could see him with the note in his hand. He crammed thenote deep into his pocket and answered the telephone, trembling.It was an old aunt of his and she sniffled into the receiver, asking to borrowsome money. He called her an old bitch and hung up.Through the open bedroom door, Antonina Pavlovna, sitting at her dressing table,brushing her hair, called out in a piercing voice, objecting to the use of suchlanguage. He whirled upon her ferociously: “If it weren’t for you and that damnlover of yours . . .”Antonina Pavlovna shrieked: “He’s not my lover—yet! If he were, do you think I’dbe squatting around a sloppy old fool like you?”They had a quarrel.Morozov forgot about the note in his pocket.063 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_063_r1.jpg]The European roof garden had a ceiling of glass panes; it looked like a blackvoid staring down, crushing those below more implacably than a steel vault.There were lights; yellow lights that looked dimmed in an oppressive haze whichwas cigarette smoke, or heat, or the black abyss above. There were white tablesand yellow glints in the silverware.Men sat at the tables. Yellow sparks flashed in their diamond studs and in thebeads of moisture on their red, flushed faces. They ate; they bent eagerly overtheir plates; they chewed hurriedly, incredulously; they were not out on acarefree evening in a gay night spot; they were eating.In a corner, a yellowish bald head went over a red steak on a white plate; theman cut the steak, smacking his fleshy red lips. Across the table, a red-headedgirl of fifteen ate hastily, her head drawn into her shoulders; when she raisedher head, she blushed from the tip of her short, freckled nose to her white,freckled neck, and her mouth was twisted as if she were going to scream.A fierce jet of smoke swayed by a dark window pane; a thin individual, with along face that betrayed too closely its future appearance as a skull, rockedmonotonously on the back legs of his chair, and smoked without interruption,holding a cigarette in long, yellow fingers, spouting smoke out of wide nostrilsfrozen in a sardonic, unhealthy grin.Women moved among the tables, with an awkward, embarrassed insolence. A head ofsoft, golden waves nodded unsteadily under a light, wide eyes in deep bluerings, a young mouth open in a vicious, sneering smile. In the middle of theroom, a gaunt, dark woman with knobs on her shoulders, holes under hercollar-bones and a skin the color of muddy coffee, was laughing too loudly,opening painted lips like a gash over strong white teeth and very red gums.The orchestra played “John Gray.” It flung brief, blunt notes out into space, asif tearing them off the strings before they were ripe, hiding the gap of anuncapturable gaiety under a convulsive rhythm.Waiters glided soundlessly through the crowd and bent over the tables,obsequious and exaggerated, and their flabby jowls conveyed expressions ofrespect, and mockery, and pity for those guilty, awkward ones who made such aneffort to be gay.Morozov did remember that he had to raise money before morning. He came to theEuropean roof garden, alone. He sat at three different tables, smoked fourdifferent cigars and whispered confidentially into five different ears thatbelonged to corpulent men who did not seem to be in a hurry. At the end of twohours, he had the money in his wallet.He mopped his forehead with relief, sat alone at a table in a dark corner andordered cognac.Stepan Timoshenko leaned so far across a white table cloth that he seemed to belying on, rather than sitting at, the table. His head was propped on his elbow,his fingers on the nape of his broad neck; he had a glass in his other hand.When the glass was empty, he held it uncertainly in the air, wondering how torefill it with one hand; he solved the problem by dropping the glass with asonorous crash and lifting the bottle to his lips. The maitre d‘hotel looked athim nervously, sidewise, frowning; he frowned at the jacket with the rabbit furcollar, at the crumpled sailor cap sliding over one ear, at the muddy shoesflung out onto the satin train of a woman at the next table. But the maitred’hotel had to be cautious; Stepan Timoshenko had been there before; everyoneknew that he was a Party member.A waiter slid unobtrusively up to his table and gathered the broken glass into adust-pan. Another waiter brought a sparkling clean glass and slipped his fingersgently over Timoshenko’s bottle, whispering: “May I help you, citizen?”“Go to hell!” said Timoshenko and pushed the glass across the table with theback of his hand. The glass vacillated on the edge and crashed down. “I’ll do asI please!” Timoshenko roared, and heads turned to look at him. “I’ll drink outof a bottle if I please. I’ll drink out of two bottles!”“But, citizen ...”“Want me to show you how?” Timoshenko asked, his eyes gleaming ominously.“No, indeed, citizen,” the waiter said hastily.“Go to hell,” said Timoshenko with soft persuasion. “I don’t like your snoot. Idon’t like any of the snoots around here.” He rose, swaying, roaring: “I don’tlike any of the damn snoots around here!”He staggered among the tables. The maitre d’hotel whispered gently at his elbow:“If you’re not feeling well, citizen ...”“Out of my way!” bellowed Timoshenko, tripping over a woman’s slippers.He had almost reached the door, when he stopped suddenly and his face meltedinto a wide, gentle smile. “Ah,” he said. “A friend of mine. A dear friend ofmine!”He staggered to Morozov, swung a chair high over someone’s head, planted it witha resounding smash at Morozov’s table and sat down.“I beg your pardon, citizen?” Morozov gasped, rising.“Sit still, pal,” said Timoshenko and his huge tanned paw pressed Morozov’sshoulder down, like a sledge hammer, so that Morozov fell back on his chair witha thud. “Can’t run away from a friend, Comrade Morozov. We’re friends, you know.Old friends. Well, maybe you don’t know me. Stepan Timoshenko’s the name. StepanTimoshenko.... Of the Red Baltfleet,” he added as an after-thought.“Oh,” said Morozov. “Oh.”“Yep,” said Timoshenko, “an old friend and admirer of yours. And you know what?”“No,” said Morozov.“We gotta have a drink together. Like good pals. We gotta have a drink. Waiter!”he roared so loudly that a violinist missed a note of “John Gray.”“Bring us two bottles!” Timoshenko ordered when a waiter bowed hesitantly overhis shoulder. “No! Bring us three bottles!”“Three bottles of what, citizen?” the waiter asked timidly.“Of anything,” said Timoshenko. “No! Wait! What’s the most expensive? What is itthat the good, fat capitalists guzzle in proper style?”“Champagne, citizen?”“Make it champagne and damn quick! Three bottles and two glasses!”When the waiter brought the champagne, Timoshenko poured it and planted a glassbefore Morozov. “There!” said Timoshenko with a friendly smile. “Going to drinkwith me, pal?”“Yes, co . . . comrade,” said Morozov meekly. “Thank you, comrade.”“Your health, Comrade Morozov!” said Timoshenko, solemnly, raising his glass.“To Comrade Morozov, citizen of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics!”They clinked their glasses. Morozov glanced around furtively, helplessly, but nohelp was coming. He drank, the glass trembling at his lips. Then he smiledingratiatingly: “This was very nice of you, comrade,” he muttered, rising. “AndI appreciate it very much, comrade. Now if you don’t mind. I’ve got to be goingand . . .”“Sit still,” ordered Timoshenko. He refilled his glass and raised it, leaningback, smiling, but his smile did not seem friendly any longer and his dark eyeswere looking at Morozov steadily, sardonically. “To the great Citizen Morozov,the man who beat the revolution!” he said and laughed resonantly, and emptiedthe glass in one gulp, his head thrown back.“Comrade ...” Morozov muttered through lips he could barely force open, “comrade. . . what do you mean?”Timoshenko laughed louder and leaned across the table toward Morozov, his elbowscrossed, his cap far back on his head, over sticky ringlets of dark hair. Thelaughter stopped abruptly, as if slashed off. Timoshenko said softly,persuasively, with a smile that frightened Morozov more than the laughter:“Don’t look so scared, Comrade Morozov. You don’t have to be afraid of me. I’mnothing but a beaten wretch, beaten by you, Comrade Morozov, and all I want isto tell you humbly that I know I’m beaten and I hold no grudge. Hell, I hold aprofound admiration for you, Comrade Morozov. You’ve taken the greatestrevolution the world has ever seen and patched the seat of your pants with it!”“Comrade,” said Morozov with a blue-lipped determination, “I don’t know whatyou’re talking about.”“Oh, yes,” said Timoshenko ruefully. “Oh, yes, you do. You know more about itthan I do, more than millions of young fools do, that watch us from all over theworld with worshipping eyes. You must tell them, Comrade Morozov. You have a lotto tell them.”“Honestly, comrade, I . . .”“For instance, you know how you made us do it. I don’t. All I know is that we’vedone it. We made a revolution. We had red banners. The banners said that we madeit for the world proletariat. We had fools who thought in their doomed heartsthat we made it for all those downtrodden ones who suffer on this earth. But youand me, Comrade Morozov, we have a secret. We know, but we won’t tell. Why tell?The world doesn’t want to hear it. We know that the revolution—it was made foryou, Comrade Morozov, and hats off to you!”“Comrade whoever you are, comrade,” Morozov moaned, “what do you want?”“Just to tell you it’s yours, Comrade Morozov.”“What?” Morozov asked, wondering if he was going insane.“The revolution,” said Timoshenko pleasantly. “The revolution. Do you know whata revolution is? I’ll tell you. We killed. We killed men in the streets, and inthe cellars, and aboard our ships.... Aboard our ships . . . I remember . . .There was one boy—an officer—he couldn’t have been more than twenty. He made thesign of the cross—his mother must’ve taught him that. He had blood running outof his mouth. He looked at me. His eyes—they weren’t frightened any more. Theywere kind of astonished. About something his mother hadn’t taught him. He lookedat me. That was the last thing. He looked at me.”Drops were rolling down Timoshenko’s jowls. He filled a glass and it tottereduncertainly in his hand, trying to find his mouth, and he drank without knowingthat he was drinking, his eyes fixed on Morozov’s.“That’s what we did in the year nineteen-hundred-and-seventeen. Now I’ll tellyou what we did it for. We did it so that the Citizen Morozov could get up inthe morning and scratch his belly, because the mattress wasn’t soft enough andit made his navel itch. We did it so that he could ride in a big limousine witha down pillow on the seat and a little glass tube for flowers by the window,lilies-of-the-valley, you know. So that he could drink cognac in a place likethis. So that he could scramble up, on holidays, to a stand all draped in redbunting and make a speech about the proletariat. We did it, Comrade Morozov, andwe take a bow. Don’t glare at me like that, Comrade Morozov, I’m only yourhumble servant, I’ve done my best for you, and you should reward me with asmile, really, you have a lot to thank me for!”“Comrade!” Morozov panted. “Let me go!”“Sit still!” Timoshenko roared. “Pour yourself a glass and drink. Do you hearme? Drink, you bastard! Drink and listen!”Morozov obeyed; his glass tinkled, shaking, against the bottle.“You see,” said Timoshenko, as if each word were tearing his throat on its wayout, “I don’t mind that we’re beaten. I don’t mind that we’ve taken the greatestof crimes on our shoulders and then let it slip through our fingers. I wouldn’tmind it if we had been beaten by a tall warrior in a steel helmet, a humandragon spitting fire. But we’re beaten by a louse. A big, fat, slow, blondlouse. Ever seen lice? The blond ones are the fattest.... It was our own fault.Once, men were ruled with a god’s thunder. Then they were ruled with a sword.Now they’re ruled with a Primus. Once, they were held by reverence. Then theywere held by fear. Now they’re held by their stomachs. Men have worn chains ontheir necks, and on their wrists, and on their ankles. Now they’re enchained bytheir rectums. Only you don’t hold heroes by their rectums. It was our ownfault.”“Comrade, for God’s sake, comrade, why tell it all to me?”“We started building a temple. Do we end with a chapel? No! And we don’t evenend with an outhouse. We end with a musty kitchen with a second-hand stove! Weset fire under a kettle and we brewed and stirred and mixed blood and fire andsteel. What are we fishing now out of the brew? A new humanity? Men of granite?Or at least a good and horrible monster? No! Little puny things that wiggle.Little things that can bend both ways, little double-jointed spirits. Littlethings that don’t even bow humbly to be whipped. No! They take the lashobediently and whip themselves! Ever sat at a social-activity club meeting?Should. Do you good. Learn a lot about the human spirit.”“Comrade!” Morozov breathed. “What do you want? Is it money you want? I’ll pay.I’ll ...”Timoshenko laughed so loudly that heads turned and Morozov cringed, trying notto be noticed. “You louse!” Timoshenko roared, laughing. “You fool,near-sighted, demented louse! Who do you think you’re talking to? Comrade VictorDunaev? Comrade Pavel Syerov? Comrade . . .”“Comrade!” Morozov roared, so that heads turned to him, but he did not care anylonger. “You . . . you . . . you have no right to say that! I have nothingwhatever to do with Comrade Syerov! I ...”“Say,” Timoshenko remarked slowly, “I didn’t say you had. Why the excitement?”“Well, I thought . . . I . . . you . . .”“I didn’t say you had,” Timoshenko repeated. “I only said you should have. Youand he and Victor Dunaev. And about one million others—with Party cards andstamps affixed. The winners and the conquerors. Those who crawl. That, pal, isthe great slogan of the men of the future: those who crawl. Listen, do you knowhow many millions of eyes are watching us across lands and oceans? They’re notvery close and they can’t see very well. They see a big shadow rising. Theythink it’s a huge beast. They’re too far to see that it’s soft and brownish andfuzzy. You know, fuzzy, a glistening sort of fuzz. They don’t know that it’smade of cockroaches. Little, glossy, brown cockroaches, packed tight, one on theother, into a huge wall. Little cockroaches that keep silent and wiggle theirwhiskers. But the world is too far to see the whiskers. That’s what’s wrong withthe world, Comrade Morozov : they don’t see the whiskers!”“Comrade! Comrade, what are you talking about?”“They see a black cloud and they hear thunder. They’ve been told that behind thecloud, blood is running freely, and men fight, and men kill, and men die. Well,what of it? They, those who watch, are not afraid of blood. There’s an honor inblood. But do they know that it’s not blood we’re bathed in, it’s pus? Listen,I’ll give you advice. If you want to keep this land in your tentacles, tell theworld that you’re chopping heads off for breakfast and shooting men by theregiment. Let the world think that you’re a huge monster to be feared andrespected and fought honorably. But don’t let them know that yours is not anarmy of heroes, nor even of fiends, but of shriveled bookkeepers with a rupturewho’ve learned to be arrogant. Don’t let them know that you’re not to be shot,but to be disinfected. Don’t let them know that you’re not to be fought withcannons, but with carbolic acid!”Morozov’s napkin was crumpled into a drenched ball in his fist. He wiped hisforehead once more. He said, trying to make his voice gentle and soothing,trying to rise imperceptibly: “You’re right, comrade. Those are very finesentiments. I agree with you absolutely. Now if you’ll allow . . .”“Sit down!” roared Timoshenko. “Sit down and drink a toast. Drink it or I’llshoot you like a mongrel. I still carry a gun, you know. Here . . .” he pouredand a pale golden trickle ran down the table cloth to the floor. “Drink to themen who took a red banner and wiped their ass with it!”Morozov drank.Then he put his hand in his pocket and took out a handkerchief to mop hisforehead. A crumpled piece of paper fell to the floor.It was the swift, ferocious jerk, with which Morozov plunged down for it, thatmade Timoshenko’s fist dart out and seize Morozov’s hand. “What’s that, pal?”asked Timoshenko.Morozov’s foot kicked the paper out of reach and it rolled under an empty table.Morozov said indifferently, little damp beads sparkling under his wide nostrils:“Oh, that? Nothing, comrade. Nothing at all. Just some scrap of waste paper.”“Oh,” said Timoshenko, watching him with eyes that were alarmingly sober. “Oh,just a scrap of waste paper. Well, we’ll let it lie there. We’ll let the janitorthrow it in the waste basket.”“Yes,” Morozov nodded eagerly, “that’s it. In the waste basket. Very well put,comrade.” He giggled, mopping his forehead. “We’ll let the janitor throw it inthe waste basket. Would you like another drink, comrade? The bottle’s empty. Thenext one’s on me. Waiter! Another bottle of the same.”“Sure,” said Timoshenko without moving. “I’ll have another drink.”The waiter brought the bottle. Morozov filled the glasses, leaning solicitouslyover the table. He said, regaining his voice syllable by syllable: “You know,comrade, I think you misunderstood me, but I don’t blame you. I can see yourmotives and I sympathize thoroughly. There are so many objectionable—er—shall wesay dishonorable?—types these days. One has to be careful. We must get betteracquainted, comrade. It’s hard to tell at a glance, you know, and particularlyin a place like this. I bet you thought I was a—a speculator, or something.Didn’t you? Very funny, isn’t it?”“Very,” said Timoshenko. “What are you looking down at, Comrade Morozov?”“Oh!” Morozov giggled, jerking his head up. “I was just looking at my shoes,comrade. They’re sort of tight, you know. Uncomfortable. Guess it’s because I’mon my feet so much, you know, in the office.”“Uh-huh,” said Timoshenko. “Shouldn’t neglect your feet. Should take a hot bathwhen you come home, a pan of hot water with a little vinegar. That’s good forsore feet.”“Oh, indeed? I’m glad you told me. Yes, indeed, thank you very much. I’ll besure and try it. First thing when I get home.”“About time you were getting home, isn’t it, Comrade Morozov?”“Oh! ... well, I guess . . . well, it’s not so late yet and . . .”“I thought you were in a hurry a little while ago.”“I . . . well, no, I can’t say that I’m in any particular hurry, and besides,such a pleasant . . .”“What’s the matter, Comrade Morozov? Anything you don’t want to leave aroundhere?”“Who, me? I don’t know what that could be, comrade . . . comrade ... what didyou say your name was, comrade?”“Timoshenko. Stepan Timoshenko. It isn’t that little scrap of waste paper downthere under the table, by any chance?”“Oh, that? Why, Comrade Timoshenko, I’d forgotten all about that. What would Iwant with it?”“I don’t know,” said Timoshenko slowly.“That’s just it, Comrade Timoshenko, nothing. Nothing at all. Another drink,Comrade Timoshenko?”“Thanks.”“Here you are, comrade.”“Anything wrong under the table, Comrade Morozov?”“Why no, Comrade Timoshenko. I was just bending to tie my shoe lace. The shoelace is unfastened.”“Where?”“Well, isn’t that funny? It really isn’t unfastened at all. See? And I thoughtit was. You know how it is, these Soviet . . . these shoe laces nowadays. Notsolid at all. Not dependable.”“No,” said Timoshenko, “they tear like twine.”“Yes,” said Morozov, “just like twine. Just, as you would say, like—liketwine.... What are you leaning over for, Comrade Timoshenko? You’re notcomfortable. Why don’t you move over here like this, you’ll be more . . .”“No,” said Timoshenko, “I’m just fine here where I am. With a fine view of thetable there. I like that table. Nice legs it has. Hasn’t it? Sort of artistic,you know.”“Quite right, comrade, very artistic. Now on the other hand, comrade, there, onour left, isn’t that a pretty blonde there, by the orchestra? Quite a figure,eh?”“Yes, indeed, comrade.... It’s nice shoes you have, Comrade Morozov. Patentleather, too. Bet you didn’t get those in a co-operative.”“No . . . that is . . . to tell you the truth . . . well, you see . . .”“What I like about them is that bulb. Right there, on the toes. Like a bump onsomeone’s forehead. And shiny, too. Yep, those foreigners sure know how to makeshoes.”“Speaking of the efficiency of production, comrade, take for instance, in thecapitalistic countries . . . in the . . . in the . . .”“Yes, Comrade Morozov, in the capitalistic countries?”It was Morozov who leaped for the letter. It was Timoshenko who caught his wristwith fingers like talons, and for one brief moment they were on their hands andknees on the floor, and their eyes met silently like those of two beasts indeadly battle. Then Timoshenko’s other hand seized the letter, and he roseslowly, releasing Morozov, and sat down at the table. He was reading the letter,while Morozov was still on his hands and knees, staring up at him with the eyesof a man awaiting the verdict of a court-martial. MOROZOV, YOU GOD-DAMN BASTARD! If you don’t come across with what’s due me before tomorrow morning, you’ll eatbreakfast at the G.P.U., and you know what that means, Affectionately,PAVEL SYEROV.Morozov was sitting at the table when Timoshenko raised his head from theletter. Timoshenko laughed as Morozov had never heard a man laugh.Timoshenko rose slowly, laughing. His stomach shook, and his rabbit fur collar,and the sinews of his bare throat. He swayed a little and he held the letter inboth hands. Then his laughter died down slowly, smoothly, like a gramophonerecord unwinding, to a low, coughing chuckle on a single dry note. He slippedthe letter into his pocket and turned slowly, his shoulders stooped, hismovements suddenly awkward, humble. He shuffled heavily, uncertainly to thedoor. At the door, the maitre d’hotel glanced at him sidewise. Timoshenkoreturned the glance; Timoshenko’s glance was gentle.Morozov sat at the table, one hand frozen in mid-air in an absurd, twistedposition, like the hand of a paralytic. He heard Timoshenko’s chuckles droppingdown the stairway; monotonous, disjoined chuckles that sounded like hiccoughs,like barks, like sobs.He jumped up suddenly. “Oh my God!” he moaned. “Oh, my God!”He ran, forgetting his hat and coat, down the long stairs, out into the snow. Inthe broad, white, silent street, Timoshenko was nowhere in sight.064 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_064_r1.jpg]Morozov did not send the money to Pavel Syerov. He did not go to his own officeat the Food Trust. He sat all the following morning and all of the afternoon athome, in his room, and drank vodka. Whenever he heard the telephone or the doorbell ringing, he crouched, his head in his shoulders, and bit his knuckles.Nothing happened.At dinner time, Antonina Pavlovna brought the evening paper and threw it to him,snapping: “What the hell’s the matter with you today?”He glanced through the paper. There were news items on the front page:In the village Vasilkino, in the Kama region, the peasants, goaded by thecounter-revolutionary hoarder element, burned the local Club of Karl Marx. Thebodies of the Club president and secretary, Party comrades from Moscow, werefound in the charred ruins. A G.PU. squad is on its way to Vasilkino.In the village Sverskoe, twenty-five peasants were executed last night for themurder of the Village Correspondent, a young comrade from the staff of aCommunist Union of Youth newspaper in Samara. The peasants refused to divulgethe name of the murderer. On the last page was a short item: The body of Stepan Timoshenko, former sailor of the Baltic Fleet, was foundearly this morning under a bridge, on the ice of Obukhovsky Canal. He had shothimself through the mouth. No papers, save his Party card, were found on thebody to explain the reason for his suicide.Morozov wiped his forehead, as if a noose had been slipped off his throat, anddrank two glasses of vodka.When the telephone rang, he swaggered boldly to take the receiver, and AntoninaPavlovna wondered why he was chuckling.“Morozov?” a muffled voice whispered over the wire.“That you, Pavlusha?” Morozov asked. “Listen, pal, I’m awfully sorry, but I havethe money and . . .”“Forget the money,” Syerov hissed. “It’s all right. Listen . . . did I leave youa note yesterday?”“Why, yes, but I guess I deserved it and . . .”“Have you destroyed it?”“Why?”“Nothing. Only you understand what it could . . . Have you destroyed it?”Morozov looked at the evening paper, grinned and said: “Sure. I have. Forgetabout it, pal.”He held the paper in his hand all evening long.“The fool!” he muttered under his breath, so that Antonina Pavlovna looked athim inquisitively, chin forward. “The damn fool! He lost it. Wandered about allnight, God knows where, the drunken fool. He lost it!”Morozov did not know that Stepan Timoshenko had come home from the European roofgarden and sat at a rickety table in his unheated garret and writtenpainstakingly a letter on a piece of brown wrapping paper, in the light of adying candle in a green bottle; that he had folded the letter carefully andslipped it into an old envelope and slipped another scrap of paper, wrinkled andcreased, into the envelope, and written Andrei Taganov’s address on it; that hehad sealed the letter and had gone, steadily, unhurriedly, down the creakingstairs into the street.The letter on the brown wrapping paper said:DEAR FRIEND ANDREI,I promised to say good-bye and here it is. It’s not quite what I promised, but Iguess you’ll forgive me. I’m sick of seeing what I see and I can’t stand to seeit any longer. To you—as my only legacy—I’m leaving the letter you will findenclosed. It’s a hard legacy, I know. I only hope that you won’t follow me—toosoon.Your friend,STEPAN TIMOSHENKO."},{"pageContent":"2. Capitalism vs. Collectivism In her defense of individualism, AR is neither a “conservative” nor a“libertarian.” Rejecting both movements, she describes herself as a “radical forcapitalism.” In other words, she identifies and defends the intellectual rootsof capitalism on the deepest level—as the following, from her 1965 essay “WhatIs Capitalism?” (published in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal), demonstrates.WHAT IS CAPITALISM?. . . MANKIND IS not an entity, an organism, or a coral bush. The entityinvolved in production and trade is man. It is with the study of man—not of theloose aggregate known as a “community”—that any science of the humanities has tobegin.This issue represents one of the epistemological differences between thehumanities and the physical sciences, one of the causes of the former’swell-earned inferiority complex in regard to the latter. A physical sciencewould not permit itself (not yet, at least) to ignore or bypass the nature ofits subject. Such an attempt would mean: a science of astronomy that gazed atthe sky, but refused to study individual stars, planets, and satellites—or ascience of medicine that studied disease, without any knowledge or criterion ofhealth, and took, as its basic subject of study, a hospital as a whole, neverfocusing on individual patients.A great deal may be learned about society by studying man; but this processcannot be reversed: nothing can be learned about man by studying society—bystudying the inter-relationships of entities one has never identified ordefined. Yet that is the methodology adopted by most political economists. Theirattitude, in effect, amounts to the unstated, implicit postulate: “Man is thatwhich fits economic equations.” Since he obviously does not, this leads to thecurious fact that in spite of the practical nature of their science, politicaleconomists are oddly unable to relate their abstractions to the concretes ofactual existence.It leads also to a baffling sort of double standard or double perspective intheir way of viewing men and events: if they observe a shoemaker, they find nodifficulty in concluding that he is working in order to make a living; but aspolitical economists, on the tribal premise, they declare that his purpose (andduty) is to provide society with shoes. If they observe a panhandler on a streetcorner, they identify him as a bum; in political economy, he becomes “asovereign consumer.” If they hear the communist doctrine that all propertyshould belong to the state, they reject it emphatically and feel, sincerely,that they would fight communism to the death; but in political economy, theyspeak of the government’s duty to effect “a fair redistribution of wealth,” andthey speak of businessmen as the best, most efficient trustees of the nation’s“natural resources.”This is what a basic premise (and philosophical negligence) will do; this iswhat the tribal premise has done.To reject that premise and begin at the beginning—in one’s approach to politicaleconomy and to the evaluation of various social systems—one must begin byidentifying man’s nature, i.e., those essential characteristics whichdistinguish him from all other living species.Man’s essential characteristic is his rational faculty. Man’s mind is his basicmeans of survival—his only means of gaining knowledge. [...]A process of thought is an enormously complex process of identification andintegration, which only an individual mind can perform. There is no such thingas a collective brain. Men can learn from one another, but learning requires aprocess of thought on the part of every individual student. Men can cooperate inthe discovery of new knowledge, but such cooperation requires the independentexercise of his rational faculty by every individual scientist. Man is the onlyliving species that can transmit and expand his store of knowledge fromgeneration to generation; but such transmission requires a process of thought onthe part of the individual recipients. As witness, the breakdowns ofcivilization, the dark ages in the history of mankind’s progress, when theaccumulated knowledge of centuries vanished from the lives of men who wereunable, unwilling, or forbidden to think.In order to sustain its life, every living species has to follow a certaincourse of action required by its nature. The action required to sustain humanlife is primarily intellectual: everything man needs has to be discovered by hismind and produced by his effort. Production is the application of reason to theproblem of survival.If some men do not choose to think, they can survive only by imitating andrepeating a routine of work discovered by others—but those others had todiscover it, or none would have survived. If some men do not choose to think orto work, they can survive (temporarily) only by looting the goods produced byothers—but those others had to produce them, or none would have survived.Regardless of what choice is made, in this issue, by any man or by any number ofmen, regardless of what blind, irrational, or evil course they may choose topursue—the fact remains that reason is man’s means of survival and that menprosper or fail, survive or perish in proportion to the degree of theirrationality.Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual,since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on theindividual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of theinterference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient norinfallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursuetheir own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment.Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.A rational mind does not work under compulsion; it does not subordinate itsgrasp of reality to anyone’s orders, directives, or controls; it does notsacrifice its knowledge, its view of the truth, to anyone’s opinions, threats,wishes, plans, or “welfare.” Such a mind may be hampered by others, it may besilenced, proscribed, imprisoned, or destroyed; it cannot be forced; a gun isnot an argument. (An example and symbol of this attitude is Galileo.)It is from the work and the inviolate integrity of such minds—from theintransigent innovators—that all of mankind’s knowledge and achievements havecome. (See The Fountainhead.) It is to such minds that mankind owes itssurvival. (See Atlas Shrugged.)The same principle applies to all men, on every level of ability and ambition.To the extent that a man is guided by his rational judgment, he acts inaccordance with the requirements of his nature and, to that extent, succeeds inachieving a human form of survival and well-being; to the extent that he actsirrationally, he acts as his own destroyer.The social recognition of man’s rational nature—of the connection between hissurvival and his use of reason—is the concept of individual rights.I shall remind you that “rights” are a moral principle defining and sanctioninga man’s freedom of action in a social context, that they are derived from man’snature as a rational being and represent a necessary condition of his particularmode of survival. I shall remind you also that the right to life is the sourceof all rights, including the right to property.In regard to political economy, this last requires special emphasis: man has towork and produce in order to support his life. He has to support his life by hisown effort and by the guidance of his own mind. If he cannot dispose of theproduct of his effort, he cannot dispose of his effort; if he cannot dispose ofhis effort, he cannot dispose of his life. Without property rights, no otherrights can be practiced.Now, bearing these facts in mind, consider the question of what social system isappropriate to man.A social system is a set of moral-political-economic principles embodied in asociety’s laws, institutions, and government, which determine the relationships,the terms of association, among the men living in a given geographical area. Itis obvious that these terms and relationships depend on an identification ofman’s nature, that they would be different if they pertain to a society ofrational beings or to a colony of ants. It is obvious that they will beradically different if men deal with one another as free, independentindividuals, on the premise that every man is an end in himself—or as members ofa pack, each regarding the others as the means to his ends and to the ends of“the pack as a whole.”There are only two fundamental questions (or two aspects of the same question)that determine the nature of any social system: Does a social system recognizeindividual rights?—and: Does a social system ban physical force from humanrelationships? The answer to the second question is the practical implementationof the answer to the first.Is man a sovereign individual who owns his person, his mind, his life, his workand its products—or is he the property of the tribe (the state, the society, thecollective) that may dispose of him in any way it pleases, that may dictate hisconvictions, prescribe the course of his life, control his work and expropriatehis products? Does man have the right to exist for his own sake—or is he born inbondage, as an indentured servant who must keep buying his life by serving thetribe but can never acquire it free and clear?This is the first question to answer. The rest is consequences and practicalimplementations. The basic issue is only: Is man free?In mankind’s history, capitalism is the only system that answers: Yes.Capitalism is a social system based on the recognition of individual rights,including property rights, in which all property is privately owned.The recognition of individual rights entails the banishment of physical forcefrom human relationships: basically, rights can be violated only by means offorce. In a capitalist society, no man or group may initiate the use of physicalforce against others. The only function of the government, in such a society, isthe task of protecting man’s rights, i.e., the task of protecting him fromphysical force; the government acts as the agent of man’s right of self-defense,and may use force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate itsuse; thus the government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of forceunder objective control.It is the basic, metaphysical fact of man’s nature—the connection between hissurvival and his use of reason—that capitalism recognizes and protects.In a capitalist society, all human relationships are voluntary. Men are free tocooperate or not, to deal with one another or not, as their own individualjudgments, convictions, and interests dictate. They can deal with one anotheronly in terms of and by means of reason, i.e., by means of discussion,persuasion, and contractual agreement, by voluntary choice to mutual benefit.The right to agree with others is not a problem in any society; it is the rightto disagree that is crucial. It is the institution of private property thatprotects and implements the right to disagree—and thus keeps the road open toman’s most valuable attribute (valuable personally, socially, and objectively):the creative mind.This is the cardinal difference between capitalism and collectivism.The power that determines the establishment, the changes, the evolution, and thedestruction of social systems is philosophy. The role of chance, accident, ortradition, in this context, is the same as their role in the life of anindividual: their power stands in inverse ratio to the power of a culture’s (oran individual’s) philosophical equipment, and grows as philosophy collapses. Itis, therefore, by reference to philosophy that the character of a social systemhas to be defined and evaluated. Corresponding to the four branches ofphilosophy, the four keystones of capitalism are: metaphysically, therequirements of man’s nature and survival—epistemologically, reason—ethically,individual rights—politically, freedom.This, in substance, is the base of the proper approach to political economy andto an understanding of capitalism—not the tribal premise inherited fromprehistorical traditions.The “practical” justification of capitalism does not lie in the collectivistclaim that it effects “the best allocation of national resources.” Man is not a“national resource” and neither is his mind—and without the creative power ofman’s intelligence, raw materials remain just so many useless raw materials.The moral justification of capitalism does not lie in the altruist claim that itrepresents the best way to achieve “the common good.” It is true that capitalismdoes—if that catch-phrase has any meaning—but this is merely a secondaryconsequence. The moral justification of capitalism lies in the fact that it isthe only system consonant with man’s rational nature, that it protects man’ssurvival qua man, and that its ruling principle is: justice.Every social system is based, explicitly or implicitly, on some theory ofethics. The tribal notion of “the common good” has served as the moraljustification of most social systems—and of all tyrannies—in history. The degreeof a society’s enslavement or freedom corresponded to the degree to which thattribal slogan was invoked or ignored.“The common good” (or “the public interest”) is an undefined and undefinableconcept: there is no such entity as “the tribe” or “the public”; the tribe (orthe public or society) is only a number of individual men. Nothing can be goodfor the tribe as such; “good” and “value” pertain only to a living organism—toan individual living organism—not to a disembodied aggregate of relationships.“The common good” is a meaningless concept, unless taken literally, in whichcase its only possible meaning is: the sum of the good of all the individual meninvolved. But in that case, the concept is meaningless as a moral criterion: itleaves open the question of what is the good of individual men and how does onedetermine it?It is not, however, in its literal meaning that that concept is generally used.It is accepted precisely for its elastic, undefinable, mystical character whichserves, not as a moral guide, but as an escape from morality. Since the good isnot applicable to the disembodied, it becomes a moral blank check for those whoattempt to embody it.When “the common good” of a society is regarded as something apart from andsuperior to the individual good of its members, it means that the good of somemen takes precedence over the good of others, with those others consigned to thestatus of sacrificial animals. It is tacitly assumed, in such cases, that “thecommon good” means “the good of the majority” as against the minority or theindividual. Observe the significant fact that that assumption is tacit: even themost collectivized mentalities seem to sense the impossibility of justifying itmorally. But “the good of the majority,” too, is only a pretense and a delusion:since, in fact, the violation of an individual’s rights means the abrogation ofall rights, it delivers the helpless majority into the power of any gang thatproclaims itself to be “the voice of society” and proceeds to rule by means ofphysical force, until deposed by another gang employing the same means.If one begins by defining the good of individual men, one will accept as properonly a society in which that good is achieved and achievable. But if one beginsby accepting “the common good” as an axiom and regarding individual good as itspossible but not necessary consequence (not necessary in any particular case),one ends up with such a gruesome absurdity as Soviet Russia, a countryprofessedly dedicated to “the common good,” where, with the exception of aminuscule clique of rulers, the entire population has existed in subhuman miseryfor over two generations.What makes the victims and, worse, the observers accept this and other similarhistorical atrocities, and still cling to the myth of “the common good”? Theanswer lies in philosophy—in philosophical theories on the nature of moralvalues.There are, in essence, three schools of thought on the nature of the good: theintrinsic, the subjective, and the objective. The intrinsic theory holds thatthe good is inherent in certain things or actions as such, regardless of theircontext and consequences, regardless of any benefit or injury they may cause tothe actors and subjects involved. It is a theory that divorces the concept of“good” from beneficiaries, and the concept of “value” from valuer andpurpose—claiming that the good is good in, by, and of itself.The subjectivist theory holds that the good bears no relation to the facts ofreality, that it is the product of a man’s consciousness, created by hisfeelings, desires, “intuitions,” or whims, and that it is merely an “arbitrarypostulate” or an “emotional commitment.”The intrinsic theory holds that the good resides in some sort of reality,independent of man’s consciousness; the subjectivist theory holds that the goodresides in man’s consciousness, independent of reality.The objective theory holds that the good is neither an attribute of “things inthemselves” nor of man’s emotional states, but an evaluation of the facts ofreality by man’s consciousness according to a rational standard of value.(Rational, in this context, means: derived from the facts of reality andvalidated by a process of reason.) The objective theory holds that the good isan aspect of reality in relation to man—and that it must be discovered, notinvented, by man. Fundamental to an objective theory of values is the question:Of value to whom and for what? An objective theory does not permitcontext-dropping or “concept-stealing”; it does not permit the separation of“value” from “purpose,” of the good from beneficiaries, and of man’s actionsfrom reason.Of all the social systems in mankind’s history, capitalism is the only systembased on an objective theory of values.The intrinsic theory and the subjectivist theory (or a mixture of both) are thenecessary base of every dictatorship, tyranny, or variant of the absolute state.Whether they are held consciously or subconsciously—in the explicit form of aphilosopher’s treatise or in the implicit chaos of its echoes in an averageman’s feelings—these theories make it possible for a man to believe that thegood is independent of man’s mind and can be achieved by physical force.If a man believes that the good is intrinsic in certain actions, he will nothesitate to force others to perform them. If he believes that the human benefitor injury caused by such actions is of no significance, he will regard a sea ofblood as of no significance. If he believes that the beneficiaries of suchactions are irrelevant (or interchangeable), he will regard wholesale slaughteras his moral duty in the service of a “higher” good. It is the intrinsic theoryof values that produces a Robespierre, a Lenin, a Stalin, or a Hitler. It is notan accident that Eichmann was a Kantian.If a man believes that the good is a matter of arbitrary, subjective choice, theissue of good or evil becomes, for him, an issue of: my feelings or theirs? Nobridge, understanding, or communication is possible to him. Reason is the onlymeans of communication among men, and an objectively perceivable reality istheir only common frame of reference; when these are invalidated (i.e., held tobe irrelevant) in the field of morality, force becomes men’s only way of dealingwith one another. If the subjectivist wants to pursue some social ideal of hisown, he feels morally entitled to force men “for their own good,” since he feelsthat he is right and that there is nothing to oppose him but their misguidedfeelings.Thus, in practice, the proponents of the intrinsic and the subjectivist schoolsmeet and blend. (They blend in terms of their psycho-epistemology as well: bywhat means do the moralists of the intrinsic school discover theirtranscendental “good,” if not by means of special, non-rational intuitions andrevelations, i.e., by means of their feelings?) It is doubtful whether anyonecan hold either of these theories as an actual, if mistaken, conviction. Butboth serve as a rationalization of power-lust and of rule by brute force,unleashing the potential dictator and disarming his victims.The objective theory of values is the only moral theory incompatible with ruleby force. Capitalism is the only system based implicitly on an objective theoryof values—and the historic tragedy is that this has never been made explicit.If one knows that the good is objective—i.e., determined by the nature ofreality, but to be discovered by man’s mind—one knows that an attempt to achievethe good by physical force is a monstrous contradiction which negates moralityat its root by destroying man’s capacity to recognize the good, i.e., hiscapacity to value. Force invalidates and paralyzes a man’s judgment, demandingthat he act against it, thus rendering him morally impotent. A value which oneis forced to accept at the price of surrendering one’s mind, is not a value toanyone; the forcibly mindless can neither judge nor choose nor value. An attemptto achieve the good by force is like an attempt to provide a man with a picturegallery at the price of cutting out his eyes. Values cannot exist (cannot bevalued) outside the full context of a man’s life, needs, goals, and knowledge.The objective view of values permeates the entire structure of a capitalistsociety.The recognition of individual rights implies the recognition of the fact thatthe good is not an ineffable abstraction in some supernatural dimension, but avalue pertaining to reality, to this earth, to the lives of individual humanbeings (note the right to the pursuit of happiness). It implies that the goodcannot be divorced from beneficiaries, that men are not to be regarded asinterchangeable, and that no man or tribe may attempt to achieve the good ofsome at the price of the immolation of others.The free market represents the social application of an objective theory ofvalues. Since values are to be discovered by man’s mind, men must be free todiscover them—to think, to study, to translate their knowledge into physicalform, to offer their products for trade, to judge them, and to choose, be itmaterial goods or ideas, a loaf of bread or a philosophical treatise. Sincevalues are established contextually, every man must judge for himself, in thecontext of his own knowledge, goals, and interests. Since values are determinedby the nature of reality, it is reality that serves as men’s ultimate arbiter:if a man’s judgment is right, the rewards are his; if it is wrong, he is hisonly victim.It is in regard to a free market that the distinction between an intrinsic,subjective, and objective view of values is particularly important tounderstand. The market value of a product is not an intrinsic value, not a“value in itself” hanging in a vacuum. A free market never loses sight of thequestion: Of value to whom? And, within the broad field of objectivity, themarket value of a product does not reflect its philosophically objective value,but only its socially objective value.By “philosophically objective,” I mean a value estimated from the standpoint ofthe best possible to man, i.e., by the criterion of the most rational mindpossessing the greatest knowledge, in a given category, in a given period, andin a defined context (nothing can be estimated in an undefined context). Forinstance, it can be rationally proved that the airplane is objectively ofimmeasurably greater value to man (to man at his best) than the bicycle—and thatthe works of Victor Hugo are objectively of immeasurably greater value thantrue-confession magazines. But if a given man’s intellectual potential canbarely manage to enjoy true confessions, there is no reason why his meagerearnings, the product of his effort, should be spent on books he cannot read—oron subsidizing the airplane industry, if his own transportation needs do notextend beyond the range of a bicycle. (Nor is there any reason why the rest ofmankind should be held down to the level of his literary taste, his engineeringcapacity, and his income. Values are not determined by fiat nor by majorityvote.)Just as the number of its adherents is not a proof of an idea’s truth orfalsehood, of an art work’s merit or demerit, of a product’s efficacy orinefficacy—so the free-market value of goods or services does not necessarilyrepresent their philosophically objective value, but only their sociallyobjective value, i.e., the sum of the individual judgments of all the meninvolved in trade at a given time, the sum of what they valued, each in thecontext of his own life.Thus, a manufacturer of lipstick may well make a greater fortune than amanufacturer of microscopes—even though it can be rationally demonstrated thatmicroscopes are scientifically more valuable than lipstick. But—valuable towhom?A microscope is of no value to a little stenographer struggling to make aliving; a lipstick is; a lipstick, to her, may mean the difference betweenself-confidence and self-doubt, between glamour and drudgery.This does not mean, however, that the values ruling a free market aresubjective. If the stenographer spends all her money on cosmetics and has noneleft to pay for the use of a microscope (for a visit to the doctor) when sheneeds it, she learns a better method of budgeting her income; the free marketserves as her teacher: she has no way to penalize others for her mistakes. Ifshe budgets rationally, the microscope is always available to serve her ownspecific needs and no more, as far as she is concerned: she is not taxed tosupport an entire hospital, a research laboratory, or a space ship’s journey tothe moon. Within her own productive power, she does pay a part of the cost ofscientific achievements, when and as she needs them. She has no “social duty,”her own life is her only responsibility—and the only thing that a capitalistsystem requires of her is the thing that nature requires: rationality, i.e.,that she live and act to the best of her own judgment.Within every category of goods and services offered on a free market, it is thepurveyor of the best product at the cheapest price who wins the greatestfinancial rewards in that field—not automatically nor immediately nor by fiat,but by virtue of the free market, which teaches every participant to look forthe objective best within the category of his own competence, and penalizesthose who act on irrational considerations.Now observe that a free market does not level men down to some commondenominator—that the intellectual criteria of the majority do not rule a freemarket or a free society—and that the exceptional men, the innovators, theintellectual giants, are not held down by the majority. In fact, it is themembers of this exceptional minority who lift the whole of a free society to thelevel of their own achievements, while rising further and ever further.A free market is a continuous process that cannot be held still, an upwardprocess that demands the best (the most rational) of every man and rewards himaccordingly. While the majority have barely assimilated the value of theautomobile, the creative minority introduces the airplane. The majority learn bydemonstration, the minority is free to demonstrate. The “philosophicallyobjective” value of a new product serves as the teacher for those who arewilling to exercise their rational faculty, each to the extent of his ability.Those who are unwilling remain unrewarded—as well as those who aspire to morethan their ability produces. The stagnant, the irrational, the subjectivist haveno power to stop their betters.(The small minority of adults who are unable rather than unwilling to work, haveto rely on voluntary charity; misfortune is not a claim to slave labor; there isno such thing as the right to consume, control, and destroy those without whomone would be unable to survive. As to depressions and mass unemployment, theyare not caused by the free market, but by government interference into theeconomy.)The mental parasites—the imitators who attempt to cater to what they think isthe public’s known taste—are constantly being beaten by the innovators whoseproducts raise the public’s knowledge and taste to ever higher levels. It is inthis sense that the free market is ruled, not by the consumers, but by theproducers. The most successful ones are those who discover new fields ofproduction, fields which had not been known to exist.A given product may not be appreciated at once, particularly if it is tooradical an innovation; but, barring irrelevant accidents, it wins in the longrun. It is in this sense that the free market is not ruled by the intellectualcriteria of the majority, which prevail only at and for any given moment; thefree market is ruled by those who are able to see and plan long-range-and thebetter the mind, the longer the range.The economic value of a man’s work is determined, on a free market, by a singleprinciple: by the voluntary consent of those who are willing to trade him theirwork or products in return. This is the moral meaning of the law of supply anddemand; it represents the total rejection of two vicious doctrines: the tribalpremise and altruism. It represents the recognition of the fact that man is notthe property nor the servant of the tribe, that a man works in order to supporthis own life-as, by his nature, he must—that he has to be guided by his ownrational self-interest, and if he wants to trade with others, he cannot expectsacrificial victims, i.e., he cannot expect to receive values without tradingcommensurate values in return. The sole criterion of what is commensurate, inthis context, is the free, voluntary, uncoerced judgment of the traders.The tribal mentalities attack this principle from two seemingly opposite sides:they claim that the free market is “unfair” both to the genius and to theaverage man. The first objection is usually expressed by a question such as:“Why should Elvis Presley make more money than Einstein?” The answer is: Becausemen work in order to support and enjoy their own lives—and if many men findvalue in Elvis Presley, they are entitled to spend their money on their ownpleasure. Presley’s fortune is not taken from those who do not care for his work(I am one of them) nor from Einstein—nor does he stand in Einstein’s way—nordoes Einstein lack proper recognition and support in a free society, on anappropriate intellectual level.As to the second objection, the claim that a man of average ability suffers an“unfair” disadvantage on a free market—Look past the range of the moment, you who cry that you fear to compete with menof superior intelligence, that their mind is a threat to your livelihood, thatthe strong leave no chance to the weak in a market of voluntary trade.... Whenyou live in a rational society, where men are free to trade, you receive anincalculable bonus: the material value of your work is determined not only byyour effort, but by the effort of the best productive minds who exist in theworld around you....The machine, the frozen form of a living intelligence, is the power that expandsthe potential of yours life by raising the productivity of your time.... Everyman is free to rise as far as he’s able or willing, but it’s only the degree towhich he thinks that determines the degree to which he’ll rise. Physical laboras such can extend no further than the range of the moment. The man who does nomore than physical labor, consumes the material value-equivalent of his owncontribution to the process of production, and leaves no further value, neitherfor himself nor others. But the man who produces an idea in any field ofrational endeavor—the man who discovers new knowledge—is the permanentbenefactor of humanity. . . . It is only the value of an idea that can be sharedwith unlimited numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one’s sacrificeor loss, raising the productive capacity of whatever labor they perform....In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man who creates a new inventionreceives but a small percentage of his value in terms of material payment, nomatter what fortune he makes, no matter what millions he earns. But the man whoworks as a janitor in the factory producing that invention, receives an enormouspayment in proportion to the mental effort that his job requires of him. And thesame is true of all men between, on all levels of ambition and ability. The manat the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes the most to all those belowhim, but gets nothing except his material payment, receiving no intellectualbonus from others to add to the value of his time. The man at the bottom who,left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing tothose above him, but receives the bonus of all of their brains. Such is thenature of the “competition” between the strong and the weak of the intellect.Such is the pattern of “exploitation” for which you have damned the strong.(Atlas Shrugged)And such is the relationship of capitalism to man’s mind and to man’s survival.The magnificent progress achieved by capitalism in a brief span of time—thespectacular improvement in the conditions of man’s existence on earth—is amatter of historical record. It is not to be hidden, evaded, or explained awayby all the propaganda of capitalism’s enemies. But what needs special emphasisis the fact that this progress was achieved by non-sacrificial means.Progress cannot be achieved by forced privations, by squeezing a “socialsurplus” out of starving victims. Progress can come only out of individualsurplus, i.e., from the work, the energy, the creative over-abundance of thosemen whose ability produces more than their personal consumption requires, thosewho are intellectually and financially able to seek the new, to improve on theknown, to move forward. In a capitalist society, where such men are free tofunction and to take their own risks, progress is not a matter of sacrificing tosome distant future, it is part of the living present, it is the normal andnatural, it is achieved as and while men live—and enjoy—their lives....065 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_065_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: The defining principle of capitalism, individual rights, isexplained more fully in the following excerpts, from AR’s 1963 essay “Man’sRights” (also published in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal).MAN’S RIGHTSIF ONE wishes to advocate a free society—that is, capitalism—one must realizethat its indispensable foundation is the principle of individual rights. If onewishes to uphold individual rights, one must realize that capitalism is the onlysystem that can uphold and protect them. And if one wishes to gauge therelationship of freedom to the goals of today’s intellectuals, one may gauge itby the fact that the concept of individual rights is evaded, distorted,perverted and seldom discussed, most conspicuously seldom by the so-called“conservatives.”“Rights” are a moral concept—the concept that provides a logical transition fromthe principles guiding an individual’s actions to the principles guiding hisrelationship with others—the concept that preserves and protects individualmorality in a social context—the link between the moral code of a man and thelegal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are themeans of subordinating society to moral law.Every political system is based on some code of ethics. The dominant ethics ofmankind’s history were variants of the altruist-collectivist doctrine whichsubordinated the individual to some higher authority, either mystical or social.Consequently, most political systems were variants of the same statist tyranny,differing only in degree, not in basic principle, limited only by the accidentsof tradition, of chaos, of bloody strife and periodic collapse. Under all suchsystems, morality was a code applicable to the individual, but not to society.Society was placed outside the moral law, as its embodiment or source orexclusive interpreter—and the inculcation of self-sacrificial devotion to socialduty was regarded as the main purpose of ethics in man’s earthly existence.Since there is no such entity as “society,” since society is only a number ofindividual men, this meant, in practice, that the rulers of society were exemptfrom moral law; subject only to the traditional rituals, they held total powerand exacted blind obedience—on the implicit principle of: “The good is thatwhich is good for society (or for the tribe, the race, the nation), and theruler’s edicts are its voice on earth.”This was true of all statist systems, under all variants of thealtruist-collectivist ethics, mystical or social. “The Divine Right of Kings”summarizes the political theory of the first—” Vox populi, vox dei” of thesecond. As witness: the theocracy of Egypt, with the Pharaoh as an embodiedgod—the unlimited majority rule or democracy of Athens—the welfare state run bythe Emperors of Rome—the Inquisition of the late Middle Ages—the absolutemonarchy of France—the welfare state of Bismarck’s Prussia—the gas chambers ofNazi Germany—the slaughterhouse of the Soviet Union.All these political systems were expressions of the altruist-collectivistethics—and their common characteristic is the fact that society stood above themoral law, as an omnipotent, sovereign whim worshipper. Thus, politically, allthese systems were variants of an amoral society.The most profoundly revolutionary achievement of the United States of Americawas the subordination of society to moral law.The principle of man’s individual rights represented the extension of moralityinto the social system—as a limitation on the power of the state, as man’sprotection against the brute force of the collective, as the subordination ofmight to right. The United States was the first moral society in history.All previous systems had regarded man as a sacrificial means to the ends ofothers, and society as an end in itself. The United States regarded man as anend in himself, and society as a means to the peaceful, orderly, voluntaryco-existence of individuals. All previous systems had held that man’s lifebelongs to society, that society can dispose of him in any way it pleases, andthat any freedom he enjoys is his only by favor, by the permission of society,which may be revoked at any time. The United States held that man’s life is hisby right (which means: by moral principle and by his nature), that a right isthe property of an individual, that society as such has no rights, and that theonly moral purpose of a government is the protection of individual rights.A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom ofaction in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (all the othersare its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his own life. Life is aprocess of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life meansthe right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated action—which means:the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational beingfor the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his ownlife. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit ofhappiness.)The concept of a “right” pertains only to action—specifically, to freedom ofaction. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interference byother men.Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positive —of hisfreedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary,uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no obligations on themexcept of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his rights.The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is theironly implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible.Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right tothe product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produceswhile others dispose of his product, is a slave.Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all theothers: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequencesof producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earnany property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is theright to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.The concept of individual rights is so new in human history that most men havenot grasped it fully to this day. In accordance with the two theories of ethics,the mystical or the social, some men assert that rights are a gift ofGod—others, that rights are a gift of society. But, in fact, the source ofrights is man’s nature.The Declaration of Independence stated that men “are endowed by their Creatorwith certain unalienable rights.” Whether one believes that man is the productof a Creator or of nature, the issue of man’s opinion does not alter the factthat he is an entity of a specific kind—a rational being—that he cannot functionsuccessfully under coercion, and that rights are a necessary condition of hisparticular mode of survival.“The source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the lawof identity. A is A—and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence requiredby man’s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth, it is rightfor him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free judgment, it isright to work for his values and to keep the product of his work. If life onearth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature forbidshim the irrational.” (Atlas Shrugged)To violate man’s right means to compel him to act against his own judgment, orto expropriate his values. Basically, there is only one way to do it: by the useof physical force. There are two potential violators of man’s rights: thecriminals and the government. The great achievement of the United States was todraw a distinction between these two—by forbidding to the second the legalizedversion of the activities of the first.The Declaration of Independence laid down the principle that “to secure theserights, governments are instituted among men.” This provided the only validjustification of a government and defined its only proper purpose: to protectman’s rights by protecting him from physical violence.Thus the government’s function was changed from the role of ruler to the role ofservant. The government was set to protect man from criminals—and theConstitution was written to protect man from the government. The Bill of Rightswas not directed against private citizens, but against the government—as anexplicit declaration that individual rights supersede any public or socialpower.The result was the pattern of a civilized society which—for the brief span ofsome hundred and fifty years—America came close to achieving. A civilizedsociety is one in which physical force is banned from human relationships—inwhich the government, acting as a policeman, may use force only in retaliationand only against those who initiate its use.This was the essential meaning and intent of America’s political philosophy,implicit in the principle of individual rights. But it was not formulatedexplicitly, nor fully accepted nor consistently practiced.America’s inner contradiction was the altruist-collectivist ethics. Altruism isincompatible with freedom, with capitalism and with individual rights. Onecannot combine the pursuit of happiness with the moral status of a sacrificialanimal.It was the concept of individual rights that had given birth to a free society.It was with the destruction of individual rights that the destruction of freedomhad to begin.A collectivist tyranny dare not enslave a country by an outright confiscation ofits values, material or moral. It has to be done by a process of internalcorruption. Just as in the material realm the plundering of a country’s wealthis accomplished by inflating the currency—so today one may witness the processof inflation being applied to the realm of rights. The process entails such agrowth of newly promulgated “rights” that people do not notice the fact that themeaning of the concept is being reversed. Just as bad money drives out goodmoney, so these “printing-press rights” negate authentic rights.Consider the curious fact that never has there been such a proliferation, allover the world, of two contradictory phenomena: of alleged new “rights” and ofslave-labor camps.The “gimmick” was the switch of the concept of rights from the political to theeconomic realm.The Democratic Party platform of 1960 summarizes the switch boldly andexplicitly. It declares that a Democratic Administration “will reaffirm theeconomic bill of rights which Franklin Roosevelt wrote into our nationalconscience sixteen years ago.”Bear clearly in mind the meaning of the concept of “rights” when you read thelist which that platform offers:“1. The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops orfarms or mines of the nation.”2. The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing andrecreation.“3. The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return whichwill give him and his family a decent living.”4. The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphereof freedom from unfair and competition and domination by monopolies at home andabroad.“5. The right of every family to a decent home.”6. The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoygood health.“7. The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age,sickness, accidents and unemployment.”8. The right to a good education.”A single question added to each of the above eight clauses would make the issueclear: At whose expense?Jobs, food, clothing, recreation (!), homes, medical care, education, etc., donot grow in nature. These are man-made values—goods and services produced bymen. Who is to provide them?If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of others, itmeans that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor.Any alleged “right” of one man, which necessitates the violation of the rightsof another, is not and cannot be a right.No man can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation, an unrewarded duty oran involuntary servitude on another man. There can be no such thing as “theright to enslave.”A right does not include the material implementation of that right by other men;it includes only the freedom to earn that implementation by one’s own effort.Observe, in this context, the intellectual precision of the Founding Fathers:they spoke of the right to the pursuit of happiness—not of the right tohappiness. It means that a man has the right to take the actions he deemsnecessary to achieve his happiness; it does not mean that others must make himhappy.The right to life means that a man has the right to support his life by his ownwork (on any economic level, as high as his ability will carry him); it does notmean that others must provide him with the necessities of life.The right to property means that a man has the right to take the economicactions necessary to earn property, to use it and to dispose of it; it does notmean that others must provide him with property.The right of free speech means that a man has the right to express his ideaswithout danger of suppression, interference or punitive action by thegovernment. It does not mean that others must provide him with a lecture hall, aradio station or a printing press through which to express his ideas.Any undertaking that involves more than one man, requires the voluntary consentof every participant. Every one of them has the right to make his own decision,but none has the right to force his decision on the others.There is no such thing as “a right to a job”—there is only the right of freetrade, that is: a man’s right to take a job if another man chooses to hire him.There is no “right to a home,” only the right of free trade: the right to builda home or to buy it. There are no “rights to a ‘fair’ wage or a ‘fair’ price” ifno one chooses to pay it, to hire a man or to buy his product. There are no“rights of consumers” to milk, shoes, movies or champagne if no producers chooseto manufacture such items (there is only the right to manufacture them oneself).There are no “rights” of special groups, there are no “rights of farmers, ofworkers, of businessmen, of employees, of employers, of the old, of the young,of the unborn.” There are only the Rights of Man—rights possessed by everyindividual man and by all men as individuals.Property rights and the right of free trade are man’s only “economic rights”(they are, in fact, political rights)—and there can be no such thing as “aneconomic bill of rights.” But observe that the advocates of the latter have allbut destroyed the former.Remember that rights are moral principles which define and protect a man’sfreedom of action, but impose no obligations on other men. Private citizens arenot a threat to one another’s rights or freedom. A private citizen who resortsto physical force and violates the rights of others is a criminal—and men havelegal protection against him.Criminals are a small minority in any age or country. And the harm they havedone to mankind is infinitesimal when compared to the horrors—the bloodshed, thewars, the persecutions, the confiscations, the famines, the enslavements, thewholesale destructions—perpetrated by mankind’s governments. Potentially, agovernment is the most dangerous threat to man’s rights: it holds a legalmonopoly on the use of physical force against legally disarmed victims. Whenunlimited and unrestricted by individual rights, a government is man’s deadliestenemy. It is not as protection against private actions, but against governmentalactions that the Bill of Rights was written. . . .066 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_066_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: This selection, written in the early 1960s and published in TheVirtue of Selfishness, is AR’s answer to the notion of “group rights.”COLLECTIVIZED “RIGHTS”RIGHTS ARE a moral principle defining proper social relationships. Just as a manneeds a moral code in order to survive (in order to act, to choose the rightgoals and to achieve them), so a society (a group of men) needs moral principlesin order to organize a social system consonant with man’s nature and with therequirements of his survival.Just as a man can evade reality and act on the blind whim of any given moment,but can achieve nothing save progressive self-destruction—so a society can evadereality and establish a system ruled by the blind whims of its members or itsleader, by the majority gang of any given moment, by the current demagogue or bya permanent dictator. But such a society can achieve nothing save the rule ofbrute force and a state of progressive self-destruction.What subjectivism is in the realm of ethics, collectivism is in the realm ofpolitics. Just as the notion that “Anything I do is right because I chose to doit,” is not a moral principle, but a negation of morality—so the notion that“Anything society does is right because society chose to do it,” is not a moralprinciple, but a negation of moral principles and the banishment of moralityfrom social issues.When “might” is opposed to “right,” the concept of “might” can have only onemeaning: the power of brute, physical force—which, in fact, is not a “power” butthe most hopeless state of impotence; it is merely the “power” to destroy; it isthe “power” of a stampede of animals running amuck.Yet that is the goal of most of today’s intellectuals. At the root of all theirconceptual switches, there lies another, more fundamental one: the switch of theconcept of rights from the individual to the collective—which means: thereplacement of “The Rights of Man” by “The Rights of Mob.”Since only an individual man can possess rights, the expression “individualrights” is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification intoday’s intellectual chaos). But the expression “collective rights” is acontradiction in terms.Any group or “collective,” large or small, is only a number of individuals. Agroup can have no rights other than the right of its individual members. In afree society, the “rights” of any group are derived from the rights of itsmembers through their voluntary, individual choice and contractual agreement,and are merely the application of these individual rights to a specificundertaking. Every legitimate group undertaking is based on the participants’right of free association and free trade. (By “legitimate,” I mean: noncriminaland freely formed, that is, a group which no one was forced to join.)For instance, the right of an industrial concern to engage in business isderived from the right of its owners to invest their money in a productiveventure—from their right to hire employees—from the right of the employees tosell their services—from the right of all those involved to produce and to selltheir products—from the right of the customers to buy (or not to buy) thoseproducts. Every link of this complex chain of contractual relationships rests onindividual rights, individual choices, individual agreements. Every agreement isdelimited, specified and subject to certain conditions, that is, dependent upona mutual trade to mutual benefit.This is true of all legitimate groups or associations in a free society:partnerships, business concerns, professional association, labor unions(voluntary ones), political parties, etc. It applies also to all agencyagreements: the right of one man to act for or represent another or others isderived from the rights of those he represents and is delegated to him by theirvoluntary choice, for a specific, delimited purpose—as in the case of a lawyer,a business representative, a labor union delegate, etc.A group, as such, has no rights. A man can neither acquire new rights by joininga group nor lose the rights which he does possess. The principle of individualrights is the only moral base of all groups or associations.Any group that does not recognize this principle is not an association, but agang or a mob.Any doctrine of group activities that does not recognize individual rights is adoctrine of mob rule or legalized lynching.The notion of “collective rights” (the notion that rights belong to groups, notto individuals) means that “rights” belong to some men, but not to others—thatsome men have the “right” to dispose of others in any manner they please—andthat the criterion of such privileged position consists of numericalsuperiority.Nothing can ever justify or validate such a doctrine—and no one ever has. Likethe altruist morality from which it is derived, this doctrine rests onmysticism: either on the old-fashioned mysticism of faith in supernaturaledicts, like “The Divine Right of Kings”—or on the social mystique of moderncollectivists who see society as a super-organism, as some supernatural entityapart from and superior to the sum of its individual members.The amorality of that collectivist mystique is particularly obvious today in theissue of national rights.A nation, like any other group, is only a number of individuals and can have norights other than the rights of its individual citizens. A free nation—a nationthat recognizes, respects and protects the individual rights of its citizens—hasa right to its territorial integrity, its social system and its form ofgovernment. The government of such a nation is not the ruler, but the servant oragent of its citizens and has no rights other than the rights delegated to it bythe citizens for a specific, delimited task (the task of protecting them fromphysical force, derived from their right of self-defense).The citizens of a free nation may disagree about the specific legal proceduresor methods of implementing their rights (which is a complex problem, theprovince of political science and of the philosophy of law), but they agree onthe basic principle to be implemented: the principle of individual rights. Whena country’s constitution places individual rights outside the reach of publicauthorities, the sphere of political power is severely delimited—and thus thecitizens may, safely and properly, agree to abide by the decisions of a majorityvote in this delimited sphere. The lives and property of minorities ordissenters are not at stake, are not subject to vote and are not endangered byany majority decision; no man or group holds a blank check on power over others.Such a nation has a right to its sovereignty (derived from the rights of itscitizens) and a right to demand that its sovereignty be respected by all othernations.But this right cannot be claimed by dictatorships, by savage tribes or by anyform of absolutist tyranny. A nation that violates the rights of its owncitizens cannot claim any rights whatsoever. In the issue of rights, as in allmoral issues, there can be no double standard. A nation ruled by brute physicalforce is not a nation, but a horde—whether it is led by Attila, Genghis Khan,Hitler, Khrushchev or Castro. What rights could Attila claim and on whatgrounds?This applies to all forms of tribal savagery, ancient or modern, primitive or“industrialized.” Neither geography nor race nor tradition nor previous state ofdevelopment can confer on some human beings the “right” to violate the rights ofothers.The right of “the self-determination of nations” applies only to free societiesor to societies seeking to establish freedom; it does not apply todictatorships. Just as an individual’s right of free action does not include the“right” to commit crimes (that is, to violate the rights of others), so theright of a nation to determine its own form of government does not include theright to establish a slave society (that is, to legalize the enslavement of somemen by others). There is no such thing as “the right to enslave. A nation can doit, just as a man can become a criminal—but neither can do it by right.It does not matter, in this context, whether a nation was enslaved by force,like Soviet Russia, or by vote, like Nazi Germany. Individual rights are notsubject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of aminority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minoritiesfrom oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is theindividual). Whether a slave society was conquered or chose to be enslaved, itcan claim no national rights and no recognition of such “rights” by civilizedcountries—just as a mob of gangsters cannot demand a recognition of its “rights”and a legal equality with an industrial concern or a university, on the groundthat the gangsters chose by unanimous vote to engage in that particular kind ofgroup activity.Dictatorship nations are outlaws. Any free nation had the right to invade NaziGermany and, today, has the right to invade Soviet Russia, Cuba or any otherslave pen. Whether a free nation chooses to do so or not is a matter of its ownself-interest, not of respect for the non-existent “rights” of gang rulers. Itis not a free nation’s duty to liberate other nations at the price ofself-sacrifice, but a free nation has the right to do it, when and if it sochooses.This right, however, is conditional. Just as the suppression of crimes does notgive a policeman the right to engage in criminal activities, so the invasion anddestruction of a dictatorship does not give the invader the right to establishanother variant of a slave society in the conquered country.A slave country has no national rights, but the individual rights of itscitizens remain valid, even if unrecognized, and the conqueror has no right toviolate them. Therefore, the invasion of an enslaved country is morallyjustified only when and if the conquerors establish a free social system, thatis, a system based on the recognition of individual rights.Since there is no fully free country today, since the so-called “Free World”consists of various “mixed economies,” it might be asked whether every countryon earth is morally open to invasion by every other. The answer is: No. There isa difference between a country that recognizes the principle of individualrights, but does not implement it fully in practice, and a country that deniesand flouts it explicitly. All “mixed economies” are in a precarious state oftransition which, ultimately, has to turn to freedom or collapse intodictatorship. There are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakablyas a dictatorship: one-party rule—executions without trial or with a mock trial,for political offenses—the nationalization or expropriation of privateproperty—and censorship. A country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moralprerogatives, any claim to national rights or sovereignty, and becomes anoutlaw.Observe, on this particular issue, the shameful end-of-trail and theintellectual disintegration of modern “liberals.”Internationalism had always been one of the “liberals’ ” basic tenets. Theyregarded nationalism as a major social evil, as a product of capitalism and asthe cause of wars. They opposed any form of national self-interest; they refusedto differentiate between rational patriotism and blind, racist chauvinism,denouncing both as “fascist.” They advocated the dissolution of nationalboundaries and the merging of all nations into “One World.” Next to propertyrights, “national rights” were the special target of their attacks.Today, it is “national rights” that they invoke as their last, feeble, fadinghold on some sort of moral justification for the results of their theories—forthe brood of little statist dictatorships spreading, like a skin disease, overthe surface of the globe, in the form of so-called “newly emerging nations,”semi-socialist, semi-communist, semi-fascist, and wholly committed only to theuse of brute force.It is the “national right” of such countries to choose their own form ofgovernment (any form they please) that the “liberals” offer as a moralvalidation and ask us to respect. It is the “national right” of Cuba to its formof government, they claim, that we must not violate or interfere with. Havingall but destroyed the legitimate national rights of free countries, it is fordictatorships that the “liberals” now claim the sanction of “national rights.”And worse: it is not mere nationalism that the “liberals” champion, butracism—primordial tribal racism.Observe the double standard: while, in the civilized countries of the West, the“liberals” are still advocating internationalism and global self-sacrifice-thesavage tribes of Asia and Africa are granted the sovereign “right” to slaughterone another in racial warfare. Mankind is reverting to a preindustrial,prehistorical view of society: to racial collectivism.Such is the logical result and climax of the “liberals’ ” moral collapse whichbegan when, as a prelude to the collectivization of property, they accepted thecollectivization of rights.Their own confession of guilt lies in their terminology. Why do they use theword “rights” to denote the things they are advocating? Why don’t they preachwhat they practice? Why don’t they name it openly and attempt to justify it, ifthey can?The answer is obvious.067 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_067_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: In a pamphlet from the 1940s, “Textbook of Americanism,” ARindicates why procapitalists should shun Utilitarianism.ON UTILITARIANISM“THE GREATEST good for the greatest number” is one of the most vicious slogansever foisted on humanity.This slogan has no concrete, specific meaning. There is no way to interpret itbenevolently, but a great many ways in which it can be used to justify the mostvicious actions.What is the definition of “the good” in this slogan? None, except: whatever isgood for the greatest number. Who, in any particular issue, decides what is goodfor the greatest number? Why, the greatest number.If you consider this moral, you would have to approve of the following examples,which are exact applications of this slogan in practice: fifty-one percent ofhumanity enslaving the other forty-nine; nine hungry cannibals eating the tenthone; a lynching mob murdering a man whom they consider dangerous to thecommunity.There were seventy million Germans in Germany and six hundred thousand Jews. Thegreatest number (the Germans) supported the Nazi govemment which told them thattheir greatest good would be served by exterminating the smaller number (theJews) and grabbing their property. This was the horror achieved in practice by avicious slogan accepted in theory.But, you might say, the majority in all these examples did not achieve any realgood for itself either? No. It didn’t. Because “the good” is not determined bycounting numbers and is not achieved by the sacrifice of anyone to anyone.The unthinking believe that this slogan implies something vaguely noble andvirtuous, that it tells men to sacrifice themselves for the greatest number ofothers. If so, should the greatest number of men wish to be virtuous andsacrifice themselves to the smallest number who would be vicious and accept it?No? Well, then should the smallest number be virtuous and sacrifice themselvesto the greatest number who would be vicious?The unthinking assume that every man who mouths this slogan places himselfunselfishly with the smaller number to be sacrificed to the greatest number ofothers. Why should he? There is nothing in the slogan to make him do this. He ismuch more likely to try to get in with the greatest number, and startsacrificing others. What the slogan actually tells him is that he has no choice,except to rob or be robbed, to crush or get crushed.The depravity of this slogan lies in the implication that “the good” of amajority must be achieved through the suffering of a minority; that the benefitof one man depends upon the sacrifice of another.If we accept the Collectivist doctrine that man exists only for the sake ofothers, then it is true that every pleasure he enjoys (or every bite of food) isevil and immoral if two other men want it. But on this basis men cannot eat,breathe or love (all of that is selfish, and what if two other men want yourwife?), men cannot live together at all, and can do nothing except end up byexterminating one another.Only on the basis of individual rights can any good—private or public—be definedand achieved. Only when each man is free to exist for his own sake—neithersacrificing others to himself nor being sacrificed to others—only then is everyman free to work for the greatest good he can achieve for himself by his ownchoice and by his own effort. And the sum total of such individual efforts isthe only kind of general, social good possible.Do not think that the opposite of “the greatest good for the greatest number” is“the greatest good for the smallest number.” The opposite is: the greatest goodhe can achieve by his own free effort, to every man living.If you are an Individualist and wish to preserve the American way of life, thegreatest contribution you can make is to discard, once and for all, from yourthinking, from your speeches, and from your sympathy, the empty slogan of “thegreatest good for the greatest number.” Reject any argument, oppose any proposalthat has nothing but this slogan to justify it. It is a booby-trap. It is aprecept of pure Collectivism. You cannot accept it and call yourself anIndividualist. Make your choice. It is one or the other.068 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_068_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART SIXRomanticism and the Benevolent Universe"},{"pageContent":"1. Romanticism EDITOR’S NOTE: AR was often asked whether she was primarily a novelist or aphilosopher. She gave her answer—and in the process indicated her view of art—ina 1963 speech at Lewis and Clark College, “The Goal of My Writing” (published inThe Romantic Manifesto).THE GOAL OF MY WRITINGTHE MOTIVE and purpose of my writing is the projection of an ideal man. Theportrayal of a moral ideal, as my ultimate literary goal, as an end in itself—towhich any didactic, intellectual or philosophical values contained in a novelare only the means.Let me stress this: my purpose is not the philosophical enlightenment of myreaders, it is not the beneficial influence which my novels may have on people,it is not the fact that my novels may help a reader’s intellectual development.All these matters are important, but they are secondary considerations, they aremerely consequences and effects, not first causes or prime movers. My purpose,first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of Howard Roark or John Galt orHank Rearden or Francisco d’Anconia as an end in himself—not as a means to anyfurther end. Which, incidentally, is the greatest value I could ever offer areader.This is why I feel a very mixed emotion—part patience, part amusement and, attimes, an empty kind of weariness—when I am asked whether I am primarily anovelist or a philosopher (as if these two were antonyms), whether my storiesare propaganda vehicles for ideas, whether politics or the advocacy ofcapitalism is my chief purpose. All such questions are so enormously irrelevant,so far beside the point, so much not my way of coming at things.My way is much simpler and, simultaneously, much more complex than that,speaking from two different aspects. The simple truth is that I approachliterature as a child does: I write—and read—for the sake of the story. Thecomplexity lies in the task of translating that attitude into adult terms.The specific concretes, the forms of one’s values, change with one’s growth anddevelopment. The abstraction “values”. does not. An adult’s values involve theentire sphere of human activity, including philosophy—most particularlyphilosophy. But the basic principle—the function and meaning of values in man’slife and in literature—remains the same.My basic test for any story is: Would I want to meet these characters andobserve these events in real life? Is this story an experience worth livingthrough for its own sake? Is the pleasure of contemplating these characters anend in itself?It’s as simple as that. But that simplicity involves the total of man’sexistence.It involves such questions as: What kind of men do I want to see in reallife—and why? What kind of events, that is, human actions, do I want to seetaking place—and why? What kind of experience do I want to live through, thatis, what are my goals—and why?It is obvious to what field of human knowledge all these questions belong: tothe field of ethics. What is the good? What are the right actions for man totake? What are man’s proper values?Since my purpose is the presentation of an ideal man, I had to define andpresent the conditions which make him possible and which his existence requires.Since man’s character is the product of his premises, I had to define andpresent the kind of premises and values that create the character of an idealman and motivate his actions; which means that I had to define and present arational code of ethics. Since man acts among and deals with other men, I had topresent the kind of social system that makes it possible for ideal men to existand to function—a free, productive, rational system, which demands and rewardsthe best in every man, great or average, and which is, obviously, laissez-fairecapitalism.But neither politics nor ethics nor philosophy are ends in themselves, neitherin life nor in literature. Only Man is an end in himself.Now observe that the practitioners of the literary school diametrically opposedto mine—the school of Naturalism—claim that a writer must reproduce what theycall “real life,” allegedly “as it is,” exercising no selectivity and novalue-judgments. By “reproduce,” they mean “photograph”; by “real life,” theymean whatever given concretes they happen to observe; by “as it is,” they mean“as it is lived by the people around them.” But observe that theseNaturalists—or the good writers among them—are extremely selective in regard totwo attributes of literature: style and characterization. Without selectivity,it would be impossible to achieve any sort of characterization whatever, neitherof an unusual man nor of an average one who is to be offered as statisticallytypical of a large segment of the population. Therefore, the Naturalists’opposition to selectivity applies to only one attribute of literature: thecontent or subject. It is in regard to his choice of subject that a novelistmust exercise no choice, they claim.Why?The Naturalists have never given an answer to that question—not a rational,logical, noncontradictory answer. Why should a writer photograph his subjectsindiscriminately and unselectively? Because they “really” happened? To recordwhat really happened is the job of a reporter or of a historian, not of anovelist. To enlighten readers and educate them? That is the job of science, notof literature, of nonfiction writing, not of fiction. To improve men’s lot byexposing their misery? But that is a value-judgment and a moral purpose and adidactic “message” —all of which are forbidden by the Naturalist doctrine.Besides, to improve anything one must know what constitutes an improvement—andto know that, one must know what is the good and how to achieve it—and to knowthat, one must have a whole system of value-judgments, a system of ethics, whichis anathema to the Naturalists.Thus, the Naturalists’ position amounts to giving a novelist full estheticfreedom in regard to means, but not in regard to ends. He may exercise choice,creative imagination, value-judgments in regard to how he portrays things, butnot in regard to what he portrays—in regard to style or characterization, butnot in regard to subject. Man—the subject of literature—must not be viewed orportrayed selectively. Man must be accepted as the given, the unchangeable, thenot-to-be-judged, the status quo. But since we observe that men do change, thatthey differ from one another, that they pursue different values, who, then, isto determine the human status quo? Naturalism’s implicit answer is: everybodyexcept the novelist.The novelist—according to the Naturalist doctrine—must neither judge nor value.He is not a creator, but only a recording secretary whose master is the rest ofmankind. Let others pronounce judgments, make decisions, select goals, fightover values and determine the course, the fate and the soul of man. The novelistis the only outcast and deserter of that battle. His is not to reason why—his isonly to trot behind his master, notebook in hand, taking down whatever themaster dictates, picking up such pearls or such swinishness as the master maychoose to drop.As far as I am concerned, I have too much self-esteem for a job of that kind.I see the novelist as a combination of prospector and jeweler. The novelist mustdiscover the potential, the gold mine, of man’s soul, must extract the gold andthen fashion as magnificent a crown as his ability and vision permit.Just as men of ambition for material values do not rummage through city dumps,but venture out into lonely mountains in search of gold—so men of ambition forintellectual values do not sit in their backyards, but venture out in quest ofthe noblest, the purest, the costliest elements. I would not enjoy the spectacleof Benvenuto Cellini making mud-pies.It is the selectivity in regard to subject—the most severely, rigorously,ruthlessly exercised selectivity—that I hold as the primary, the essential, thecardinal aspect of art. In literature, this means: the story—which means: theplot and the characters—which means: the kind of men and events that a writerchooses to portray.The subject is not the only attribute of art, but it is the fundamental one, itis the end to which all the others are the means. In most esthetic theories,however, the end—the subject—is omitted from consideration, and only the meansare regarded as esthetically relevant. Such theories set up a false dichotomyand claim that a slob portrayed by the technical means of a genius is preferableto a goddess portrayed by the technique of an amateur. I hold that both areesthetically offensive; but while the second is merely esthetic incompetence,the first is an esthetic crime.There is no dichotomy, no necessary conflict between ends and means. The enddoes not justify the means—neither in ethics nor in esthetics. And neither dothe means justify the end: there is no esthetic justification for the spectacleof Rembrandt’s great artistic skill employed to portray a side of beef.That particular painting may be taken as a symbol of everything I am opposed toin art and in literature. At the age of seven, I could not understand why anyoneshould wish to paint or to admire pictures of dead fish, garbage cans or fatpeasant women with triple chins. Today, I understand the psychological causes ofsuch esthetic phenomena—and the more I understand, the more I oppose them.In art, and in literature, the end and the means, or the subject and the style,must be worthy of each other.That which is not worth contemplating in life, is not worth re-creating in art.Misery, disease, disaster, evil, all the negatives of human existence, areproper subjects of study in life, for the purpose of understanding andcorrecting them—but are not proper subjects of contemplation for contemplation’ssake. In art, and in literature, these negatives are worth re-creating only inrelation to some positive, as a foil, as a contrast, as a means of stressing thepositive—but not as an end in themselves.The “compassionate” studies of depravity which pass for literature today are thedead end and the tombstone of Naturalism. If their perpetrators still claim thejustification that these things are “true” (most of them aren’t)—the answer isthat this sort of truth belongs in psychological case histories, not inliterature. The picture of an infected ruptured appendix may be of great valuein a medical textbook—but it does not belong in an art gallery. And an infectedsoul is a much more repulsive spectacle.That one should wish to enjoy the contemplation of values, of the good—of man’sgreatness, intelligence, ability, virtue, heroism—is self-explanatory. It is thecontemplation of the evil that requires explanation and justification; and thesame goes for the contemplation of the mediocre, the undistinguished, thecommonplace, the meaningless, the mindless.At the age of seven, I refused to read the children’s equivalent of Naturalisticliterature—the stories about the children of the folks next door. They bored meto death. I was not interested in such people in real life; I saw no reason tofind them interesting in fiction.This is still my position today; the only difference is that today I know itsfull philosophical justification.As far as literary schools are concerned, I would call myself a RomanticRealist.Consider the significance of the fact that the Naturalists call Romantic art an“escape.” Ask yourself what sort of metaphysics—what view of life—thatdesignation confesses. An escape—from what? If the projection of value-goals-theprojection of an improvement on the given, the known, the immediatelyavailable—is an “escape,” then medicine is an “escape” from disease, agricultureis an “escape” from hunger, knowledge is an “escape” from ignorance, ambition isan “escape” from sloth, and life is an “escape” from death. If so, then ahard-core realist is a vermin-eaten brute who sits motionless in a mud puddle,contemplates a pigsty and whines that “such is life.” If that is realism, then Iam an escapist. So was Aristotle. So was Christopher Columbus.There is a passage in The Fountainhead that deals with this issue: the passagein which Howard Roark explains to Steven Mallory why he chose him to do a statuefor the Stoddard Temple. In writing that passage, I was consciously anddeliberately stating the essential goal of my own work—as a kind of small,personal manifesto: “I think you’re the best sculptor we’ve got. I think it,because your figures are not what men are, but what men could be—and should be.Because you’ve gone beyond the probable and made us see what is possible, butpossible only through you. Because your figures are more devoid of contempt forhumanity than any work I’ve ever seen. Because you have a magnificent respectfor the human being. Because your figures are the heroic in man.”Today, more than twenty years later, I would want to change—or, rather, toclarify—only two small points. First, the words “more devoid of contempt forhumanity” are not too exact grammatically; what I wanted to convey was“untouched” by contempt for humanity, while the work of others was touched by itto some extent. Second, the words “possible only through you” should not betaken to mean that Mallory’s figures were impossible metaphysically, in reality;I meant that they were possible only because he had shown the way to make thempossible.“Your figures are not what men are, but what men could be—and should be.”This line will make it clear whose great philosophical principle I had acceptedand was following and had been groping for, long before I heard the name“Aristotle.” It was Aristotle who said that fiction is of greater philosophicalimportance than history, because history represents things only as they are,while fiction represents them “as they might be and ought to be.”Why must fiction represent things “as they might be and ought to be”?My answer is contained in one statement of Atlas Shrugged—and in theimplications of that statement: “As man is a being of self-made wealth, so he isa being of self-made soul.”Just as man’s physical survival depends on his own effort, so does hispsychological survival. Man faces two corollary, interdependent fields of actionin which a constant exercise of choice and a constant creative process aredemanded of him: the world around him and his own soul (by “soul,” I mean hisconsciousness). Just as he has to produce the material values he needs tosustain his life, so he has to acquire the values of character that enable himto sustain it and that make his life worth living. He is born without theknowledge of either. He has to discover both—and translate them into reality—andsurvive by shaping the world and himself in the image of his values.Growing from a common root, which is philosophy, man’s knowledge branches out intwo directions. One branch studies the physical world or the phenomenapertaining to man’s physical existence; the other studies man or the phenomenapertaining to his consciousness. The first leads to abstract science, whichleads to applied science or engineering, which leads to technology—to the actualproduction of material values. The second leads to art.Art is the technology of the soul.Art is the product of three philosophical disciplines: metaphysics,epistemology, ethics. Metaphysics and epistemology are the abstract base ofethics. Ethics is the applied science that defines a code of values to guideman’s choices and actions—the choices and actions which determine the course ofhis life; ethics is the engineering that provides the principles and blueprints.Art creates the final product. It builds the model.Let me stress this analogy: art does not teach—it shows, it displays the full,concretized reality of the final goal. Teaching is the task of ethics. Teachingis not the purpose of an art work, any more than it is the purpose of anairplane. Just as one can learn a great deal from an airplane by studying it ortaking it apart, so one can learn a great deal from an art work—about the natureof man, of his soul, of his existence. But these are merely fringe benefits. Theprimary purpose of an airplane is not to teach man how to fly, but to give himthe actual experience of flying. So is the primary purpose of an art work.Although the representation of things “as they might be and ought to be” helpsman to achieve these things in real life, this is only a secondary value. Theprimary value is that it gives him the experience of living in a world wherethings are as they ought to be. This experience is of crucial importance to him:it is his psychological life line.Since man’s ambition is unlimited, since his pursuit and achievement of valuesis a lifelong process—and the higher the values, the harder the struggle—manneeds a moment, an hour or some period of time in which he can experience thesense of his completed task, the sense of living in a universe where his valueshave been successfully achieved. It is like a moment of rest, a moment to gainfuel to move farther. Art gives him that fuel. Art gives him the experience ofseeing the full, immediate, concrete reality of his distant goals.The importance of that experience is not in what he learns from it, but in thathe experiences it. The fuel is not a theoretical principle, not a didactic“message,” but the life-giving fact of experiencing a moment of metaphysicaljoy—a moment of love for existence.A given individual may choose to move forward, to translate the meaning of thatexperience into the actual course of his own life; or he may fail to live up toit and spend the rest of his life betraying it. But whatever the case may be,the art work remains intact, an entity complete in itself, an achieved,realized, immovable fact of reality—like a beacon raised over the darkcrossroads of the world, saying: “This is possible.”No matter what its consequences, that experience is not a way station onepasses, but a stop, a value in itself. It is an experience about which one cansay: “I am glad to have reached this in my life.” There are not many experiencesof that kind to be found in the modem world.I have read a great many novels of which nothing remains in my mind but the dryrustle of scraps long since swept away. But the novels of Victor Hugo, and avery few others, were an unrepeatable experience to me, a beacon whose everybrilliant spark is as alive as ever.This aspect of art is difficult to communicate—it demands a great deal of theviewer or reader—but I believe that many of you will understand meintrospectively.There is a scene in The Fountainhead which is a direct expression of this issue.I was, in a sense, both characters in that scene, but it was written primarilyfrom the aspect of myself as the consumer, rather than the producer, of art; itwas based on my own desperate longing for the sight of human achievement. Iregarded the emotional meaning of that scene as entirely personal, almostsubjective—and I did not expect it to be shared by anyone. But that scene provedto be the one most widely understood and most frequently mentioned by thereaders of The Fountainhead.It is the opening scene of Part IV, between Howard Roark and the boy on thebicycle.The boy thought that “man’s work should be a higher step, an improvement onnature, not a degradation. He did not want to despise men; he wanted to love andadmire them. But he dreaded the sight of the first house, poolroom and movieposter he would encounter on his way.... He had always wanted to write music,and he could give no other identity to the thing he sought.... Let me see thatin one single act of man on earth. Let me see it made real. Let me see theanswer to the promise of that music.... Don’t work for my happiness, mybrothers—show me yours—show me that it is possible—show me your achievement—andthe knowledge will give me courage for mine.”This is the meaning of art in man’s life.It is from this perspective that I will now ask you to consider the meaning ofNaturalism—the doctrine which proposes to confine men to the sight of slums,poolrooms, movie posters and on down, much farther down.It is the Romantic or value-oriented vision of life that the Naturalists regardas “superficial”—and it is the vision which extends as far as the bottom of agarbage can that they regard as “profound.”It is rationality, purpose and values that they regard as naive—whilesophistication, they claim, consists of discarding one’s mind, rejecting goals,renouncing values and writing four-letter words on fences and sidewalks.Scaling a mountain, they claim, is easy—but rolling in the gutter is anoteworthy achievement.Those who seek the sight of beauty and greatness are motivated by fear, theyclaim—they who are the embodiments of chronic terror—while it takes courage tofish in cesspools.Man’s soul—they proclaim with self-righteous pride—is a sewer.Well, they ought to know.It is a significant commentary on the present state of our culture that I havebecome the object of hatred, smears, denunciations, because I am famous asvirtually the only novelist who has declared that her soul is not a sewer, andneither are the souls of her characters, and neither is the soul of man.The motive and purpose of my writing can best be summed up by saying that if adedication page were to precede the total of my work, it would read: To theglory of Man.And if anyone should ask me what it is that I have said to the glory of Man, Iwill answer only by paraphrasing Howard Roark. I will hold up a copy of AtlasShrugged and say: “The explanation rests.”069 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_069_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: This excerpt from a 1969 essay, “What is Romanticism?” (publishedin The Romantic Manifesto), offers a fuller statement of AR’s view of art—and ofits antithesis: naturalism.WHAT IS ROMANTICISM?ROMANTICISM IS a category of art based on the recognition of the principle thatman possesses the faculty of volition.Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist’s metaphysicalvalue-judgments. An artist recreates those aspects of reality which representhis fundamental view of man and of existence. In forming a view of man’s nature,a fundamental question one must answer is whether man possesses the faculty ofvolition—because one’s conclusions and evaluations in regard to all thecharacteristics, requirements and actions of man depend on the answer.Their opposite answers to this question constitute the respective basic premisesof two broad categories of art: Romanticism, which recognizes the existence ofman’s volition—and Naturalism, which denies it.In the field of literature, the logical consequences of these basic premises(whether held consciously or subconsciously) determine the form of the keyelements of a literary work.1. If man possesses volition, then the crucial aspect of his life is his choiceof values—if he chooses values, then he must act to gain and/or keep them—if so,then he must set his goals and engage in purposeful action to achieve them. Theliterary form expressing the essence of such action is the plot. (A plot is apurposeful progression of logically connected events leading to the resolutionof a climax.)The faculty of volition operates in regard to the two fundamental aspects ofman’s life: consciousness and existence, i.e., his psychological action and hisexistential action, i.e., the formation of his own character and the course ofaction he pursues in the physical world. Therefore, in a literary work, both thecharacterizations and the events are to be created by the author, according tohis view of the role of values in human psychology and existence (and accordingto the code of values he holds to be right). His characters are abstractprojections, not reproductions of concretes; they are invented conceptually, notcopied reportorially from the particular individuals he might have observed. Thespecific characters of particular individuals are merely the evidence of theirparticular value-choices and have no wider metaphysical significance (except asmaterial for the study of the general principles of human psychology); they donot exhaust man’s characterological potential.2. If man does not possess volition, then his life and his character aredetermined by forces beyond his control—if so, then the choice of values isimpossible to him—if so, then such values as he appears to hold are only anillusion, predetermined by the forces he has no power to resist—if so, then heis impotent to achieve his goals or to engage in purposeful action—and if heattempts the illusion of such action, he will be defeated by those forces, andhis failure (or occasional success) will have no relation to his actions. Theliterary form expressing the essence of this view is plotlessness (since therecan be no purposeful progression of events, no logical continuity, noresolution, no climax).If man’s character and the course of his life are the product of unknown (orunknowable) forces, then, in a literary work, both the characterizations and theevents are not to be invented by the author, but are to be copied from suchparticular characters and events as he has observed. Since he denies theexistence of any effective motivational principle in human psychology, he cannotcreate his characters conceptually. He can only observe the people he meets, ashe observes inanimate objects, and reproduce them—in the implicit hope that someclue to the unknown forces controlling human destiny may be discovered in suchreproductions.These basic premises of Romanticism and Naturalism (the volition oranti-volition premise) affect all the other aspects of a literary work, such asthe choice of theme and the quality of the style, but it is the nature of thestory structure—the attribute of plot or plotlessness— that represents the mostimportant difference between them and serves as the main distinguishingcharacteristic for classifying a given work in one category or the other.This is not to say that a writer identifies and applies all the consequences ofhis basic premise by a conscious process of thought. Art is the product of aman’s subconscious integrations, of his sense of life, to a larger extent thanof his conscious philosophical convictions. Even the choice of the basic premisemay be subconscious—since artists, like any other men, seldom translate theirsense of life into conscious terms. And, since an artist’s sense of life may beas full of contradictions as that of any other man, these contradictions becomeapparent in his work; the dividing line between Romanticism and Naturalism isnot always maintained consistently in every aspect of every given work of art(particularly since one of these basic premises is false). But if one surveysthe field of art and studies the works produced, one will observe that thedegree of consistency in the consequences of these two basic premises is aremarkably eloquent demonstration of the power of metaphysical premises in therealm of art.With very rare (and partial) exceptions, Romanticism is non-existent in today’sliterature. This is not astonishing when one considers the crushing weight ofthe philosophical wreckage under which generations of men have been brought up—awreckage dominated by the doctrines of irrationalism and determinism. In theirformative years, young people could not find much evidence on which to develop arational, benevolent, value-oriented sense of life, neither in philosophicaltheory nor in its cultural echoes nor in the daily practice of the passivelydeteriorating society around them.But observe the psychological symptoms of an unrecognized, unidentified issue:the virulently intense antagonism of today’s esthetic spokesmen to anymanifestation of the Romantic premise in art. It is particularly the attributeof plot in literature that arouses an impassioned hostility among them—ahositility with deeply personal overtones, too violent for a mere issue ofliterary canons. If plot were a negligible and inappropriate element ofliterature, as they claim it to be, why the hysterical hatred in theirdenunciations? This type of reaction pertains to metaphysical issues, i.e., toissues that threaten the foundations of a person’s entire view of life (if thatview is irrational). What they sense in a plot structure is the implicit premiseof volition (and, therefore, of moral values). The same reaction, for the samesubconscious reason, is evoked by such elements as heroes or happy endings orthe triumph of virtue, or, in the visual arts, beauty. Physical beauty is not amoral or volitional issue—but the choice to paint a beautiful human being ratherthan an ugly one, implies the existence of volition: of choice, standards,values.The destruction of Romanticism in esthetics—like the destruction ofindividualism in ethics or of capitalism in politics—was made possible byphilosophical default. It is one more demonstration of the principle that thatwhich is not known explicitly is not in man’s conscious control. In all threecases, the nature of the fundamental values involved had never been definedexplicitly, the issues were fought in terms of non-essentials, and the valueswere destroyed by men who did not know what they were losing or why.This was the predominant pattern of issues in the field of esthetics, which,throughout history, has been a virtual monopoly of mysticism. The definition ofRomanticism given here is mine—it is not a generally known or accepted one.There is no generally accepted definition of Romanticism (nor of any key elementin art, nor of art itself).Romanticism is a product of the nineteenth century—a (largely subconscious)result of two great influences: Aristotelianism, which liberated man byvalidating the power of his mind—and capitalism, which gave man’s mind thefreedom to translate ideas into practice (the second of these influences wasitself the result of the first). But while the practical consequences ofAristotelianism were reaching men’s daily existence, its theoretical influencewas long since gone: philosophy, since the Renaissance, had been retrogressingoverwhelmingly to the mysticism of Plato. Thus the historically unprecedentedevents of the nineteenth century—the Industrial Revolution, the child-prodigyspeed in the growth of science, the skyrocketing standard of living, theliberated torrent of human energy—were left without intellectual direction orevaluation. The nineteenth century was guided, not by an Aristotelianphilosophy, but by an Aristotelian sense of life. (And, like a brilliantlyviolent adolescent who fails to translate his sense of life into consciousterms, it burned itself out, choked by the blind confusions of its ownoverpowering energy.)Whatever their conscious convictions, the artists of that century’s great newschool—the Romanticists—picked their sense of life out of the culturalatmosphere: it was an atmosphere of men intoxicated by the discovery of freedom,with all the ancient strongholds of tyranny—of church, state, monarchy,feudalism—crumbling around them, with unlimited roads opening in all directionsand no barriers set to their newly unleashed energy. It was an atmosphere bestexpressed by that century’s naive, exuberant and tragically blind belief thathuman progress, from here on, was to be irresistible and automatic.Esthetically, the Romanticists were the great rebels and innovators of thenineteenth century. But, in their conscious convictions, they were for the mostpart anti-Aristotelian and leaning toward a kind of wild, freewheelingmysticism. They did not see their own rebellion in fundamental terms; they wererebelling—in the name of the individual artist’s freedom—not againstdeterminism, but, much more superficially, against the esthetic “Establishment”of the time: against Classicism.Classicism (an example of a much deeper superficiality) was a school that haddevised a set of arbitrary, concretely detailed rules purporting to representthe final and absolute criteria of esthetic value. In literature, these rulesconsisted of specific edicts, loosely derived from the Greek (and French)tragedies, which prescribed every formal aspect of a play (such as the unity oftime, place and action) down to the number of acts and the number of versespermitted to a character in every act. Some of that stuff was based onAristotle’s esthetics and can serve as an example of what happens whenconcrete-bound mentalities, seeking to by-pass the responsibility of thought,attempt to transform abstract principles into concrete prescriptions and toreplace creation with imitation. (For an example of Classicism that survivedwell into the twentieth century, I refer you to the architectural dogmasrepresented by Howard Roark’s antagonists in The Fountainhead.)Even though the Classicists had no answer to why their rules were to be acceptedas valid (except the usual appeal to tradition, to scholarship and to theprestige of antiquity), this school was regarded as the representative ofreason. (!)Such were the roots of one of the grimmest ironies in cultural history: theearly attempts to define the nature of Romanticism declared it to be an estheticschool based on the primacy of emotions—as against the champions of the primacyof reason, which were the Classicists (and, later, the Naturalists). In variousforms, this definition has persisted to our day. It is an example of theintellectually disastrous consequences of definitions by non-essentials-and anexample of the penalty one pays for a non-philosophical approach to culturalphenomena.One can observe the misapprehended element of truth that gave rise to that earlyclassification. What the Romanticists brought to art was the primacy of values,an element that had been missing in the stale, arid, third- and fourth-hand (andrate) repetitions of the Classicists’ formula-copying. Values (andvalue-judgments) are the source of emotions; a great deal of emotional intensitywas projected in the work of the Romanticists and in the reactions of theiraudiences, as well as a great deal of color, imagination, originality,excitement and all the other consequences of a value-oriented view of life. Thisemotional element was the most easily perceivable characteristic of the newmovement and it was taken as its defining characteristic, without deeperinquiry.Such issues as the fact that the primacy of values in human life is not anirreducible primary, that it rests on man’s faculty of volition, and, therefore,that the Romanticists, philosophically, were the champions of volition (which isthe root of values) and not of emotions (which are merely the consequences)—wereissues to be defined by philosophers, who defaulted in regard to esthetics asthey did in regard to every other crucial aspect of the nineteenth century.The still deeper issue, the fact that the faculty of reason is the faculty ofvolition, was not known at the time, and the various theories of free will werefor the most part of an anti-rational character, thus reinforcing theassociation of volition with mysticism.The Romanticists saw their cause primarily as a battle for their right toindividuality and—unable to grasp the deepest metaphysical justification oftheir cause, unable to identify their values in terms of reason—they fought forindividuality in terms of feelings, surrendering the banner of reason to theirenemies.There were other, lesser consequences of this fundamental error, all of themsymptoms of the intellectual confusion of the age. Groping blindly for ametaphysically oriented, grand-scale, exalted way of life, the Romanticistspredominantly, were enemies of capitalism, which they regarded as a prosaic,materialistic, “petty bourgeois” system—never realizing that it was the onlysystem that could make freedom, individuality and the pursuit of values possiblein practice. Some of them chose to be advocates of socialism; some turned forinspiration to the Middle Ages and became shameless glamorizers of thatnightmare era; some ended up where most champions of the non-rational end up: inreligion. All of it served to accelerate Romanticism’s growing break withreality.When, in the later half of the nineteenth century, Naturalism rose to prominenceand, assuming the mantle of reason and reality, proclaimed the artists’ duty toportray “things as they are”—Romanticism did not have much of an opposition tooffer.It must be noted that philosophers contributed to the confusion surrounding theterm “Romanticism.” They attached the name “Romantic” to certain philosophers(such as Schelling and Schopenhauer) who were avowed mystics advocating thesupremacy of emotions, instincts or will over reason. This movement inphilosophy had no significant relation to Romanticism in esthetics, and the twomovements must not be confused. The common nomenclature, however, is significantin one respect: it indicates the depth of the confusion on the subject ofvolition. The “Romantic” philosophers’ theories were a viciously malevolent,existence-hating attempt to uphold volition in the name of whim worship, whilethe esthetic Romanticists were groping blindly to uphold volition in the name ofman’s life and values here, on earth. In terms of essentials, the brilliantsunlight of Victor Hugo’s universe is the diametrical opposite of the venomousmuck of Schopenhauer’s. It was only philosophical package-dealing that couldthrow them in the same category. But the issue demonstrates the profoundimportance of the subject of volition, and the grotesque distortions it assumeswhen men are unable to grasp its nature. This issue may also serve as anillustration of the importance of establishing that volition is a function ofman’s rational faculty.In recent times, some literary historians have discarded, as inadequate, thedefinition of Romanticism as an emotion-oriented school and have attempted toredefine it, but without success. Following the rule of fundamentality, it is asa volition-oriented school that Romanticism must be defined—and it is in termsof this essential characteristic that the nature and history of Romanticliterature can be traced and understood.The (implicit) standards of Romanticism are so demanding that in spite of theabundance of Romantic writers at the time of its dominance, this school hasproduced very few pure, consistent Romanticists of the top rank. Amongnovelists, the greatest are Victor Hugo and Dostoevsky, and, as single novels(whose authors were not always consistent in the rest of their works), I wouldname Henryk Sienkiewicz’s Quo Vadis and Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The ScarletLetter. Among play-wrights, the greatest are Friedrich Schiller and EdmondRostand.The distinguishing characteristic of this top rank (apart from their purelyliterary genius) is their full commitment to the premise of volition in both ofits fundamental areas: in regard to consciousness and to existence, in regard toman’s character and to his actions in the physical world. Maintaining a perfectintegration of these two aspects, unmatched in the brilliant ingenuity of theirplot structures, these writers are enormously concerned with man’s soul (i.e.,his consciousness). They are moralists in the most profound sense of the word;their concern is not merely with values, but specifically with moral values andwith the power of moral values in shaping human character. Their characters are“larger than life,” i.e., they are abstract projections in terms of essentials(not always successful projections, as we shall discuss later). In theirstories, one will never find action for action’s sake, unrelated to moralvalues. The events of their plots are shaped, determined and motivated by thecharacters’ values (or treason to values), by their struggle in pursuit ofspiritual goals and by profound value-conflicts. Their themes are fundamental,universal, timeless issues of man’s existence—and they are the only consistentcreators of the rarest attribute of literature: the perfect integration of themeand plot, which they achieve with superlative virtuosity.If philosophical significance is the criterion of what is to be taken seriously,then these are the most serious writers in world literature.The second rank of Romanticists (who are still writers of considerable merit,but of lesser stature) indicates the direction of Romanticism’s future decline.This rank is represented by such writers as Walter Scott and Alexander Dumas.The distinguishing characteristic of their work is the emphasis on action,without spiritual goals or significant moral values. Their stories havewell-built, imaginative, suspenseful plot structures, but the values pursued bytheir characters and motivating the action are of a primitive, superficial,emphatically non-metaphysical order: loyalty to a king, the reclaiming of aheritage, personal revenge, etc. The conflicts and story lines are predominantlyexternal. The characters are abstractions, they are not Naturalistic copies, butthey are abstractions of loosely generalized virtues or vices, andcharacterization is minimal. In time, they become a writer’s own self-madebromides, such as “a brave knight,” “a noble lady,” “a vicious courtier”—so thatthey are neither created nor drawn from life, but picked from a kind ofready-to-wear collection of stock characters of Romanticism. The absence of anymetaphysical meaning (apart from the affirmation of volition implicit in a plotstructure) is evident in the fact that these novels have plots, but no abstractthemes—with the story’s central conflict serving as the theme, usually in theform of some actual or fictionalized historical event.Going farther down, one can observe the breakup of Romanticism, thecontradictions that proceed from a premise held subconsciously. On this level,there emerges a class of writers whose basic premise, in effect, is that manpossesses volition in regard to existence, but not to consciousness, i.e., inregard to his physical actions, but not in regard to his own character. Thedistinguishing characteristic of this class is: stories of unusual eventsenacted by conventional characters. The stories are abstract projections,involving actions one does not observe in “real life,” the characters arecommonplace concretes. The stories are Romantic, the characters Naturalistic.Such novels seldom have plots (since value-conflicts are not their motivationalprinciple), but they do have a form resembling a plot: a coherent, imaginative,often suspenseful story held together by some one central goal or undertaking ofthe characters.The contradictions in such a combination of elements are obvious; they lead to atotal breach between action and characterization, leaving the action unmotivatedand the characters unintelligible. The reader is left to feel: “These peoplecouldn’t do these things!”With its emphasis on sheer physical action and neglect of human psychology, thisclass of novels stands on the borderline between serious and popular literature.No top-rank novelists belong to this category; the better-known ones are writersof science fiction, such as H. G. Wells or Jules Verne. (Occasionally, a goodwriter of the Naturalistic school, with a repressed element of Romanticism,attempts a novel on an abstract theme that requires a Romantic approach; theresult falls into this category. For example, Sinclair Lewis’s It Can’t HappenHere.) It is obvious why the novels of this category are enormouslyunconvincing. And, no matter how skillfully or suspensefully their action ispresented, they always have an unsatisfying, uninspiring quality.On the other side of the same dichotomy, there are Romanticists whose basicpremise, in effect, is that man possesses volition in regard to consciousness,but not to existence, i.e., in regard to his own character and choice of values,but not in regard to the possibility of achieving his goals in the physicalworld. The distinguishing characteristics of such writers are grand-scale themesand characters, no plots and an overwhelming sense of tragedy, the sense of a“malevolent universe.” The chief exponents of this category were poets. Theleading one is Byron, whose name has been attached to this particular,“Byronic,” view of existence: its essence is the belief that man must lead aheroic life and fight for his values even though he is doomed to defeat by amalevolent fate over which he has no control.Today, the same view is advocated philosophically by the existentialists, butwithout the grand-scale element and with Romanticism replaced by a kind ofsub-Naturalism.Philosophically, Romanticism is a crusade to glorify man’s existence;psychologically, it is experienced simply as the desire to make lifeinteresting.This desire is the root and motor of Romantic imagination. Its greatest example,in popular literature, is O. Henry, whose unique characteristic is thepyrotechnical virtuosity of an inexhaustible imagination projecting the gaietyof a benevolent, almost childlike sense of life. More than any other writer, O.Henry represents the spirit of youth—specifically, the cardinal element ofyouth: the expectation of finding something wonderfully unexpected around all oflife’s corners.In the field of popular literature, Romanticism’s virtues and potential flawsmay be seen in a simplified, more obvious form.Popular literature is fiction that does not deal with abstract problems; ittakes moral principles as the given, accepting certain generalized, common-senseideas and values as its base. (Common-sense values and conventional values arenot the same thing; the first can be justified rationally, the second cannot.Even though the second may include some of the first, they are justified, not onthe ground of reason, but on the ground of social conformity.)Popular fiction does not raise or answer abstract questions; it assumes that manknows what he needs to know in order to live, and it proceeds to show hisadventures in living (which is one of the reasons for its popularity among alltypes of readers, including the problem-laden intellectuals). The distinctivecharacteristic of popular fiction is the absence of an explicitly ideationalelement, of the intent to convey intellectual information (or misinformation).Detective, adventure, science-fiction novels and Westerns belong, for the mostpart, to the category of popular fiction. The best writers of this category comeclose to the Scott-Dumas group: their emphasis is on action, but their heroesand villains are abstract projections, and a loosely generalized view of moralvalues, of a struggle between good and evil, motivates the action. (Ascontemporary examples of the best in this class: Mickey Spillane, Ian Fleming,Donald Hamilton.)When we go below the top level of popular fiction, we descend into a kind of noman’s land where literary principles are barely applicable (particularly if weinclude the field of movies and television). Here, the distinctivecharacteristics of Romanticism become almost indistinguishable. On this level,writing is not the product of subconscious premises: it is a mixture of elementspicked by random imitation rather than by sense-of-life creation.A certain characteristic is typical of this level: it is not merely the use ofconventional, Naturalistic characters to enact Romantic events, but worse: theuse of characters who are romanticized embodiments of conventional values. Suchembodiments represent canned values, empty stereotypes that serve as anautomatic substitute for value-judgments. This method lacks the essentialattribute of Romanticism: the independent, creative projection of an individualwriter’s values—and it lacks the reportorial honesty of the (better)Naturalists: it does not present concrete men “as they are,” it presents humanpretensions (a collective role-playing or an indiscriminate collective daydream)and palms this off as reality.Most of the “slick-magazine” fiction popular before World War II belongs to thisclass, with its endless variations on the Cinderella theme, the motherhoodtheme, the costume-drama theme, or the common-man-with-a-heart-of-gold theme.(For example, Edna Ferber, Fannie Hurst, Barry Benefield.) This type of fictionhas no plots, only more or less cohesive stories, and no discerniblecharacterizations: the characters are false journalistically, and meaninglessmetaphysically. (It is an open question whether this group belongs to thecategory of Romanticism; it is usually regarded as Romantic simply because it isfar removed from anything perceivable in reality concretely or abstractly.)As far as their fiction aspects are concerned, movies and television, by theirnature, are media suited exclusively to Romanticism (to abstractions, essentialsand drama). Unfortunately, both media came too late: the great day ofRomanticism was gone, and only its sunset rays reached a few exceptional movies.(Fritz Lang’s Siegfried is the best among them.) For a while, the movie fieldwas dominated by the equivalent of the slick-magazine Romanticism, with a stillless discriminating level of taste and imagination, and an incommunicablevulgarity of spirit.Partly in reaction against this debasement of values, but mainly in consequenceof the general philosophical-cultural disintegration of our time (with itsanti-value trend), Romanticism vanished from the movies and never reachedtelevision (except in the form of a few detective series, which are now gonealso). What remains is the occasional appearance of cowardly pieces, whoseauthors apologize for their Romantic attempts, by means of comedy—or mongrelpieces, whose authors beg not to be mistaken for advocates of human values (orhuman greatness), by means of coyly, militantly commonplace characters who enactworld-shaking events and perform fantastic feats, particularly in the realm ofscience. The nature of this type of scenario can best be encapsulated by a lineof dialogue on the order of: “Sorry, baby, I can’t take you to the pizza jointtonight, I’ve got to go back to the lab and split the atom.”The next, and final, level of disintegration is the attempt to eliminateRomanticism from Romantic fiction—i.e., to dispense with the element of values,morality and volition. This used to be called the “hard-boiled” school ofdetective fiction; today, it is plugged as “realistic.” This school makes nodistinction between heroes and villains (or detectives and criminals, or victimsand executioners) and presents, in effect, two mobs of gangsters fightingsavagely and incomprehensibly (no motivation is offered) for the same territory,neither side being able to do otherwise.This is the dead end where, arriving by different roads, Romanticism andNaturalism meet, blend and vanish: deterministically helpless, compulsively evilcharacters go through a series of inexplicably exaggerated events and engage inpurposeful conflicts without purpose.Beyond this point, the field of literature, both “serious” and popular, is takenover by a genre compared to which Romanticism and Naturalism are clean,civilized and innocently rational: the Horror Story. The modern ancestor of thisphenomenon is Edgar Allan Poe; its archetype or purest esthetic expression isBoris Karloff movies.Popular literature, more honest in this respect, presents its horrors in theform of physical monstrosities. In “serious” literature, the horrors becomepsychological and bear less resemblance to anything human; this is the literarycult of depravity.The Horror Story, in either variant, represents the metaphysical projection of asingle human emotion: blind, stark, primitive terror. Those who live in suchterror seem to find a momentary sense of relief or control in the process ofreproducing that which they fear—as savages find a sense of mastery over theirenemies by reproducing them in the form of dolls. Strictly speaking, this is nota metaphysical, but a purely psychological projection; such writers are notpresenting their view of life; they are not looking at life; what they aresaying is that they feel as if life consisted of werewolves, Draculas andFrankenstein monsters. In its basic motivation, this school belongs topsychopathology more than to esthetics.Historically, neither Romanticism nor Naturalism could survive the collapse ofphilosophy. There are individual exceptions, but I am speaking of these schoolsas broad, active, creative movements. Since art is the expression and product ofphilosophy, it is the first to mirror the vacuum at the base of a culture andthe first to crumble.This general cause had special consequences affecting Romanticism, whichhastened its decline and collapse. There were also special consequencesaffecting Naturalism, which were of a different character and their destructivepotential worked at a slower rate.The archenemy and destroyer of Romanticism was the altruist morality.Since Romanticism’s essential characteristic is the projection of values,particularly moral values, altruism introduced an insolvable conflict intoRomantic literature from the start. The altruist morality cannot be practiced(except in the form of self-destruction) and, therefore, cannot be projected ordramatized convincingly in terms of man’s life on earth (particularly in therealm of psychological motivation). With altruism as the criterion of value andvirtue, it is impossible to create an image of man at his best—“as he might beand ought to be.” The major flaw that runs through the history of Romanticliterature is the failure to present a convincing hero, i.e., a convincing imageof a virtuous man.It is the abstract intention—the grandeur of the author’s view of man—that oneadmires in the characters of Victor Hugo, not their actual characterizations.The greatest Romanticist never succeeded in projecting an ideal man or anyconvincing major characters of a positive nature. His most ambitious attempt,Jean Valjean in Les Misérables, remains a giant abstraction that neverintegrates into a person, in spite of isolated touches of profound psychologicalperceptiveness on the part of the author. In the same novel, Marius, the youngman who is supposed to be Hugo’s autobiographical projection, acquires a certainstature only by means of what the author says about him, not by means of what heshows. As far as characterization is concerned, Marius is not a person, but thesuggestion of a person squeezed into a straitjacket of cultural bromides. Thebest-drawn and most interesting characters in Hugo’s novels are thesemi-villains (his benevolent sense of life made him unable to create a realvillain): Javert in Les Misérables, Josiana in The Man Who Laughs, Claude Frolloin Notre-Dame de Paris.Dostoevsky (whose sense of life was the diametrical opposite of Hugo’s) was apassionate moralist whose blind quest for values was expressed only in thefiercely merciless condemnation with which he presented evil characters; no onehas equaled him in the psychological depth of his images of human evil. But hewas totally incapable of creating a positive or virtuous character; suchattempts as he made were crudely inept (for example, Alyosha in The BrothersKaramazov). It is significant that according to Dostoevsky’s preliminary notesfor The Possessed, his original intention was to create Stavrogin as an idealman—an embodiment of the Russian-Christian-altruist soul. As the notesprogressed, that intention changed gradually, in logically inexorable stepsdictated by Dostoevsky’s artistic integrity. In the final result, in the actualnovel, Stavrogin is one of Dostoevsky’s most repulsively evil characters.In Sienkiewicz’s Quo Vadis, the best-drawn, most colorful character, whodominates the novel, is Petronius, the symbol of Roman decadence—while Vinicius,the author’s hero, the symbol of the rise of Christianity, is a cardboardfigure.This phenomenon—the fascinating villain or colorful rogue, who steals the storyand the drama from the anemic hero—is prevalent in the history of Romanticliterature, serious or popular, from top to bottom. It is as if, under the deadcrust of the altruist code officially adopted by mankind, an illicit,subterranean fire were boiling chaotically and erupting once in a while;forbidden to the hero, the fire of self-assertiveness burst forth from theapologetic ashes of a “villain.”The highest function of Romanticism—the projection of moral values—is anextremely difficult task under any moral code, rational or not, and, in literaryhistory, only the top rank of Romanticists were able to attempt it. Given theadded burden of an irrational code, such as altruism, the majority of Romanticwriters had to avoid that task—which led to the weakness and neglect of theelement of characterization in their writing. In addition, the impossibility ofapplying altruism to reality, to men’s actual existence, led many Romanticwriters to avoid the problem by escaping into history, i.e., by choosing toplace their stories in some distant past (such as the Middle Ages). Thus, theemphasis on action, the neglect of human psychology, the lack of convincingmotivation were progressively dissociating Romanticism from reality—until thefinal remnants of Romanticism became a superficial, meaningless, “unserious”school that had nothing to say about human existence.The disintegration of Naturalism brought it to the same state, for differentreasons.Although Naturalism is a product of the nineteenth century, its spiritualfather, in modern history, was Shakespeare. The premise that man does notpossess volition, that his destiny is determined by an innate “tragic flaw,” isfundamental in Shakespeare’s work. But, granted this false premise, his approachis metaphysical, not journalistic. His characters are not drawn from “reallife,” they are not copies of observed concretes nor statistical averages: theyare grand-scale abstractions of the character traits which a determinist wouldregard as inherent in human nature: ambition, power-lust, jealousy, greed, etc.Some of the famous Naturalists attempted to maintain Shakespeare’s abstractlevel, i.e., to present their views of human nature in metaphysical terms (forexample, Balzac, Tolstoy). But the majority, following the lead of Emile Zola,rejected metaphysics, as they rejected values, and adopted the method ofjournalism: the recording of observed concretes.The contradictions inherent in determinism were obvious in this movement fromthe start. One does not read fiction except on the implicit premise ofvolition—i.e., on the premise that some element (some abstraction) of thefiction story is applicable to oneself, that one will learn, discover orcontemplate something of value and that this experience will make a difference.If one were to accept the deterministic premise fully and literally—if one wereto believe that the characters of a fiction story are as distant and irrelevantto oneself as the unknowable inhabitants of another galaxy and that they cannotaffect one’s life in any way whatever, since neither they nor the reader haveany power of choice—one would not be able to read beyond the first chapter.Nor would one be able to write. Psychologically, the whole of the Naturalistmovement rode on the premise of volition as on an unidentified, subconscious“stolen concept.” Choosing “society” as the factor that determines man’s fate,most of the Naturalists were social reformers, advocating social changes,claiming that man has no volition, but society, somehow, has. Tolstoy preachedresignation and passive obedience to society’s power. In Anna Karenina, the mostevil book in serious literature, he attacked man’s desire for happiness andadvocated its sacrifice to conformity.No matter how concrete-bound their theories forced them to be, the writers ofthe Naturalist school still had to exercise their power of abstraction to asignificant extent: in order to reproduce “real-life” characters, they had toselect the characteristics they regarded as essential, differentiating them fromthe non-essential or accidental. Thus they were led to substitute statistics forvalues as a criterion of selectivity: that which is statistically prevalentamong men, they held, is metaphysically significant and representative of man’snature; that which is rare or exceptional, is not.At first, having rejected the element of plot and even of story, the Naturalistsconcentrated on the element of characterization—and psychological perceptivenesswas the chief value that the best of them had to offer. With the growth of thestatistical method, however, that value shrank and vanished: characterizationwas replaced by indiscriminate recording and buried under a catalogue of trivia,such as minute inventories of a character’s apartment, clothing and meals.Naturalism lost the attempted universality of Shakespeare or Tolstoy, descendingfrom metaphysics to photography with a rapidly shrinking lens directed at therange of the immediate moment—until the final remnants of Naturalism became asuperficial, meaningless, “unserious” school that had nothing to say about humanexistence. [...] Such is the esthetic state of our day. But so long as men exist, the need of artwill exist, since that need is rooted metaphysically in the nature of man’sconsciousness—and it will survive a period when, under the reign ofirrationality run amuck, men produce and accept tainted scraps to satisfy thatneed.As in the case of an individual, so in the case of a culture: disasters can beaccomplished subconsciously, but a cure cannot. A cure in both cases requiresconscious knowledge, i.e., a consciously grasped, explicit philosophy.It is impossible to predict the time of a philosophical Renaissance. One canonly define the road to follow, but not its length. What is certain, however, isthat every aspect of Western culture needs a new code of ethics—a rationalethics—as a precondition of rebirth. And, perhaps, no aspect needs it moredesperately than the realm of art.When reason and philosophy are reborn, literature will be the first phoenix torise out of today’s ashes. And, armed with a code of rational values, aware ofits own nature, confident of the supreme importance of its mission, Romanticismwill have come of age.070 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_070_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"2. The Benevolent Universe EDITOR’S NOTE: Because AR advocated reason and reality in basic philosophy, sheadvocated rational values—values based on reason and reality —in ethics,politics, and esthetics. By their nature, such values are achievable by men inreality—i.e., they are achievable here and now, in this world and this life.AR, therefore, had no tolerance for the “tragic view of life” (which manyRomantic artists before her had endorsed); she rejected this idea both in lifeand in art. On the contrary, she believed that happiness, not pain—theachievement of values, not their loss—is and should be the human norm. Thus thekey statement by one of the heroes of Atlas Shrugged: “[W]e do not hold thebelief that this earth is a realm of misery where man is doomed to destruction.[...] It is not happiness, but suffering that we consider unnatural. It is notsuccess, but calamity that we regard as the abnormal exception in human life.”AR called this attitude the benevolent-universe premise. It is the deepestreason why the heroes of her novels characteristically achieve their goals;their setbacks or losses are merely temporary obstacles to be overcome bydecisive thought and action.AR’s 1962 introduction to one of her favorite pieces of fiction—a 1901 novel,Calumet “K”—discusses one key result of the benevolent-universe premise when itis applied to fiction: the portrayal of man as efficacious.INTRODUCTION TO CALUMET “K”CALUMET “K” is my favorite novel.It is not a work of great literature—it is a work of light fiction, written bytwo collaborators, that appeared originally, in the year 1901, in a popularmagazine, The Saturday Evening Post. Its style is straightforward and competent,but undistinguished. It lacks the most important ingredient of good fiction, aplot structure. But it has one element that I have never found in any othernovel: the portrait of an efficacious man.The formal hero of this novel is a grain elevator, called “Calumet ‘K’,” and thenovel tells the story of its construction, nothing more. But if you findyourself held in suspense, reading intently, hoping that the structure will bebuilt on time, if you find that two simple, descriptive paragraphs (in thechapter before last) are a gloriously triumphant experience that makes you wantto cheer aloud—it will be, like the grain elevator itself, the achievement ofCharlie Bannon.Bannon is the young superintendent in charge of building Calumet “K.” He isdescribed as follows: “He was worn thin as an old knife-blade, he was just atthe end of a piece of work that would have entitled any other man to a vacation;but MacBride made no apologies when he assigned him the new task ...” He is sentto the job because no one else is able to do it: it is virtually impossible tocomplete the elevator by a certain crucial date. The construction is the storyof Bannon’s quietly fierce struggle against powerful interests determined tosabotage the work and stop him. Behind the scenes, the fate of countless livesand enormous fortunes rests, not on Bannon’s shoulders, but on his brain.The essence of the story is Bannon’s ingenuity in solving unexpected problemsand smashing through sudden obstacles, his self-confident resourcefulness, hisinexhaustible energy, his dedication. He is a man who takes nothing for granted,who thinks long-range, who assumes responsibility as a matter of course, as away of life, knowing that there is no such thing as “luck” and if things are tobe done, he has to do them.His dominant characteristic is a total commitment to the absolutism of reality.Even though such philosophical abstractions are outside his knowledge and hisstory, his basic premise is the primacy of existence, not of consciousness—i.e.,a mind, focus and passionate concern directed outward (with its innerconcomitant: an unbreached self-esteem). This is why his story and his problemsmatter to me, as no lesser human problems can.It is not merely that Bannon is a purposeful man; there have been plenty ofpurposeful men in fiction, pursuing all sorts of goals, most of them dubious.Bannon is specifically an efficacious man: a man able to deal with reality—a manwhose characterization features, stresses and dramatizes this particular trait.In this sense, he is an American phenomenon which is not typical of any otherculture.Calumet “K” is a good example of the fact that when fiction, even light fiction,contains some element of truth about human existence, it carries philosophicalimplications wider than its specific theme. This novel is a remarkablehistorical-social-psychological document. Today, its subtitle ought to be: Thiswas America.Calumet “K” captures the atmosphere—the sense of life—of a free country: what itwas like, what it demanded of men, and, indirectly, by whom and why it would behated. The story is neither pro-business nor pro-labor, but pro-individual,i.e., pro-human ability: the enemies Bannon has to fight are a Clique of WallStreet speculators, on the one hand, and a corrupt labor leader, on the other.The story is an excellent illustration, in miniature, of the working of a freeeconomy; Bannon is pitted against the biggest evil allegedly inherent incapitalism: an attempt to establish a monopoly, a Wall Street conspiracy tocorner the wheat market. The story demonstrates that so long as men are free toact, no one will be able to cut off all avenues of action, that an attemptedevil creates its own antidotes, but one must be prepared to find them and toenlist men’s legitimate self-interests on one’s side. (In a controlled economy,Bannon would be the first victim, and the Clique would be in charge of agovernment regulatory agency.)It is interesting to note that Bannon is not an industrial tycoon, but merely anemployee of a building contractor; he is presented, not as a rare exception, butas an average man. I doubt that a man of Bannon’s stature could be average inany society; and, in a free one, he would not remain an employee for long. Buthe represents, in its purest form, the characteristic which a free societydemands of all men, on all levels of ability: competence.The story demonstrates in many skillfully subtle ways that that characteristicruns through the whole social pyramid. On the lower levels, it depends on thequality of the leadership involved in a large, cooperative undertaking. Bannon’sleadership is the decisive factor in the issue of morale or lethargicindifference on the part of all the workers on the job. His self-confidence, hisdemanding standards and his strict fairness bring out the best in them: pride intheir work, conscientiousness, energy, enthusiasm—qualities they were beginningto lose under his incompetent predecessor. Their potential virtue is like aninert, responsive mechanism that can swing either way; Bannon is the spark plug.They respond when they know that their best will be appreciated.Bannon’s predecessor, Peterson, is given an interesting characterization: he ispresented, stressedly, as a man of brawn versus Bannon, the man of brains.Peterson is not a bad person, he has merely ventured beyond his depth and foundhimself loaded with a weight beyond his capacity, a weight much greater thanthat of the timbers and sledge hammers he handles with an easy, show-offishprowess. He is on the verge of turning bad, but a job commensurate with hisability brings him back to the status of a valuable worker. “Nobody can blameme,” was, in effect, Peterson’s first concern in any emergency. “That isirrelevant,” is Bannon’s answer.On the higher levels of the pyramid, one senses—like a light flashing behind thescenes once in a while—that Bannon’s competence is recognized and appreciated byhis bosses. The same recognition greets him whenever he deals with the heads ofother companies. If he is resented, at times, it is always by the underlings,never by the big executives. One of my favorite scenes is a small incident inwhich Bannon presents to a lumber tycoon the solution to a transportationproblem the tycoon had regarded as hopeless. The scene goes as follows:“Sloan made no reply. He had allowed his wrath to boil for a few minutes merelyas a luxury. Now he was thinking seriously of the scheme. ‘It sounds likemoonshine,’ he said at last, ‘but I don’t know as it is. How are you going toget your barges?’“ ‘I’ve got one already. It leaves Milwaukee tonight.’“Sloan looked him over. ‘I wish you were out of a job,’ he said.”This is the keynote of the incredibly wonderful quality of that world which wasAmerica at the turn of the century: a world in which ability mattered.But, even within the confines of a simple, popular novel, one can see also theominous touches on the periphery of that world, the seeds of what was to destroyit.That free, violently joyous torrent of creative energy flooding a continent, wasinvisible to men: invisible intellectually. Its meaning had no conceptualidentification or moral recognition. It was cut off from all the other aspectsof men’s existence and from the formal code of values by which they lived theirlives. And that code was an ancient, ludicrously incongruous straitjacket,deforming an innocent young giant.The symptoms of that code may be seen in the novel’s lesser element: in its lovestory. Bannon’s romance with a young stenographer, the only woman on theconstruction site, is so timidly, evasively mid-Victorian that the contrast tothe rest of the novel is almost unbearable. The spectacle of men who areremaking the face of a continent, yet are supposed to pretend that a fact suchas sex does not exist, is what the mystics’ old-world morality imposed on ayoung country, along with all the rest of their “anti-materialistic” doctrines.Bannon is quite obviously a represser, who has never taken a first-hand look atanything outside his work. His work is his only happiness; everything else iscut off, as alien territory. But even the extent of his love for his work is notgiven a fully conscious recognition in his mind, nor does he consciously regardhis own competence as a virtue; he simply takes both for granted. He is notanti-intellectual, but un-inteHectual—as a man of action, too busy toconceptualize. In this respect, also, he is the typical representative ofAmerican culture—at its best and worst.The penalty for that particular flaw is indicated in the story—in an ugly littletouch that reads as if the authors, who admire Bannon tremendously, felt,nevertheless, obliged to pay lip-service to altruism. The heroine’s attitudetoward Bannon changes on the day when she discovers that he has been sendingsmall gifts to a hospitalized worker who was hurt in an accident on theconstruction site. She confesses to Bannon that: “well, some people think youdon’t think very much about the men, and that if anybody’s hurt, or anythinghappens, you don’t care as long as the work goes on”—and she apologizes to himfor having thought so, too.In other words, the feats of productive energy which he was performing wereirrelevant (or even made him an object of suspicion), but the fact that he senttobacco to a man in a hospital, was required to establish his personal virtue.Today, we can see what that little cloud of altruism, hovering on the edge of asunlit sky, has grown into—and what that cultural split has accomplished.But, as far as Calumet “K” is concerned, these are only its peripheral elements,its sky is still sunlit, brilliantly sunlit—and that is its paramount value.Culturally, Calumet “K” can serve as a gauge of the distance we have traveleddownward. It was written for a wide popular audience, and reflects the dominantsense of life of its time. It was a time when people were capable of admiringproductive achievement, when they saw man as strong, confident, cheerfullyefficacious—and the universe as a place where victory and fulfillment arepossible. Observe the extent to which this novel is “unmodern.” It is entirelydevoid of neurotic soul-searching, of bitterness, of cynicism, of that maudlinpreoccupation with depravity which is characteristic of today’s novels. What itprojects predominantly is a quality of innocence and of magnificent health. Ifyou want to feel frightened—in regard to the nature of today’s dominant sense oflife—compare Calumet “K” to any novel from any current issue of the samemagazine, The Saturday Evening Post....071 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_071_r1.jpg]EDITOR’S NOTE: This 1960 answer to a fan included in Letters of Ayn Rand is aneloquent summary of the benevolent-universe attitude.LETTER TO A FANAugust 29, 1960Dear Mr. Williams: Thank you for your letter of August 10. I will tell you frankly that yours isone of the few letters that I liked very much.I am glad that Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead have helped vouphilosophically. I hope that you will understand and accept my philosophy fully,and—if I understand you correctly—that you will never give up the values you hadonce held.You ask me about the meaning of the dialogue on page 702 of Atlas Shrugged:“ ‘We never had to take any of it seriously, did we?’ she whispered. ” ‘No, wenever had to.’ ”Let me begin by saying that this is perhaps the most important point in thewhole book, because it is the condensed emotional summation, the keynote orleitmotif, of the view of life presented in Atlas Shrugged.What Dagny expresses here is the conviction that joy, exaltation, beauty,greatness, heroism, all the supreme, uplifting values of man’s existence onearth, are the meaning of life—not the pain or ugliness he may encounter—thatone must live for the sake of such exalted moments as one may be able to achieveor experience, not for the sake of suffering—that happiness matters, butsuffering does not—that no matter how much pain one may have to endure, it isnever to be taken seriously, that is: never to be taken as the essence andmeaning of life—that the essence of life is the achievement of joy, not theescape from pain. The issue she refers to is the basic philosophical issue whichJohn Galt later names explicitly in his speech: that the most fundamentaldivision among men is between those who are pro-man, pro-mind, pro-life—andthose who are anti-man, anti-mind, anti-life.It is the difference between those who think that man’s life is important andthat happiness is possible—and those who think that man’s life, by its verynature, is a hopeless, senseless tragedy and that man is a depraved creaturedoomed to despair and defeat. It is the difference between those whose basicmotive is the desire to achieve values, to experience joy—and those whose basicmotive is the desire to escape from pain, to experience a momentary relief fromtheir chronic anxiety and guilt.It is a matter of one’s fundamental, overall attitude toward life—not of any onespecific event. So you see that your interpretation was too specific and toonarrow; besides, the Looters’ World had never meant anything to Dagny and shehad realized its “sham and hypocrisy” long before. What she felt, in thatparticular moment, was the confirmation of her conviction that an ideal man andan ideal form of existence are possible.EDITOR’S NOTE: “Don’t Let It Go,” a 1971 essay published in Philosophy: WhoNeeds It identifies what will happen to America if it does not translate itsimplicitly benevolent view of life into an explicit, rational philosophy.DON’T LET IT GOIN ORDER to form a hypothesis about the future of an individual, one mustconsider three elements: his present course of action, his consciousconvictions, and his sense of life. The same elements must be considered informing a hypothesis about the future of a nation.A sense of life is a pre-conceptual equivalent of metaphysics, an emotional,subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence. It represents anindividual’s unidentified philosophy (which can be identified—and corrected, ifnecessary); it affects his choice of values and his emotional responses,influences his actions, and, frequently, clashes with his conscious convictions,(For a detailed discussion, see “Philosophy and Sense of Life” in my book TheRomantic Manifesto.)A nation, like an individual, has a sense of life, which is expressed not in itsformal culture, but in its “life style”—in the kinds of actions and attitudeswhich people take for granted and believe to be self-evident, but which areproduced by complex evaluations involving a fundamental view of man’s nature.A “nation” is not a mystic or supernatural entity: it is a large number ofindividuals who live in the same geographical locality under the same politicalsystem. A nation’s culture is the sum of the intellectual achievements ofindividual men, which their fellow-citizens have accepted in whole or in part,and which have influenced the nation’s way of life. Since a culture is a complexbattleground of different ideas and influences, to speak of a “culture” is tospeak only of the dominant ideas, always allowing for the existence ofdissenters and exceptions.(The dominance of certain ideas is not necessarily determined by the number oftheir adherents: it may be determined by majority acceptance, or by the greateractivity and persistence of a given faction, or by default, i.e., the failure ofthe opposition, or—when a country is free—by a combination of persistence andtruth. In any case, ideas and the resultant culture are the product and activeconcern of a minority. Who constitutes this minority? Whoever chooses to beconcerned.)Similarly, the concept of a nation’s sense of life does not mean that everymember of a given nation shares it, but only that a dominant majority shares itsessentials in various degrees. In this matter, however, the dominance isnumerical: while most men may be indifferent to cultural-ideological trends, noman can escape the process of subconscious integration which forms his sense oflife.A nation’s sense of life is formed by every individual child’s early impressionsof the world around him: of the ideas he is taught (which he may or may notaccept) and of the way of acting he observes and evaluates (which he mayevaluate correctly or not). And although there are exceptions at both ends ofthe psychological spectrum—men whose sense of life is better (truerphilosophically) or worse than that of their fellow-citizens—the majoritydevelop the essentials of the same subconscious philosophy. This is the sourceof what we observe as “national characteristics.”A nation’s political trends are the equivalent of a man’s course of action andare determined by its culture. A nation’s culture is the equivalent of a man’sconscious convictions. Just as an individual’s sense of life can clash with hisconscious convictions, hampering or defeating his actions, so a nation’s senseof life can clash with its culture, hampering or defeating its political course.Just as an individual’s sense of life can be better or worse than his consciousconvictions, so can a nation’s. And just as an individual who has nevertranslated his sense of life into conscious convictions is in terrible danger—nomatter how good his subconscious values—so is a nation.This is the position of America today.If America is to be saved from destruction—specifically, from dictatorship—shewill be saved by her sense of life.As to the two other elements that determine a nation’s future, one (ourpolitical trend) is speeding straight to disaster, the other (culture) isvirtually nonexistent. The political trend is pure statism and is moving towarda totalitarian dictatorship at a speed which, in any other country, would havereached that goal long ago. The culture is worse than nonexistent: it isoperating below zero, i.e., performing the opposite of its function. A cultureprovides a nation’s intellectual leadership, its ideas, its education, its moralcode. Today, the concerted effort of our cultural “Establishment” is directed atthe obliteration of man’s rational faculty. Hysterical voices are proclaimingthe impotence of reason, extolling the “superior power” of irrationality,fostering the rule of incoherent emotions, attacking science, glorifying thestupor of drugged hippies, delivering apologies for the use of brute force,urging mankind’s return to a life of rolling in primeval muck, with grunts andgroans as means of communication, physical sensations as means of inspiration,and a club as means of argumentation.This country, with its magnificent scientific and technological power, is leftin the vacuum of a pre-intellectual era, like the wandering hordes of the DarkAges—or in the position of an adolescent before he has fully learned toconceptualize. But an adolescent has his sense of life to guide his choices. Sohas this country.What is the specifically American sense of life?A sense of life is so complex an integration that the best way to identify it isby means of concrete examples and by contrast with the manifestations of adifferent sense of life.The emotional keynote of most Europeans is the feeling that man belongs to theState, as a property to be used and disposed of, in compliance with his natural,metaphysically determined fate. A typical European may disapprove of a givenState and may rebel, seeking to establish what he regards as a better one, likea slave who might seek a better master to serve—but the idea that he is thesovereign and the government is his servant, has no emotional reality in hisconsciousness. He regards service to the State as an ultimate moral sanction, asan honor, and if you told him that his life is an end in itself, he would feelinsulted or rejected or lost. Generations brought up on statist philosophy andacting accordingly, have implanted this in his mind from the earliest, formativeyears of his childhood.A typical American can never fully grasp that kind of feeling. An American is anindependent entity. The popular expression of protest against “being pushedaround” is emotionally unintelligible to Europeans, who believe that to bepushed around is their natural condition. Emotionally, an American has noconcept of service (or of servitude) to anyone. Even if he enlists in the armyand hears it called “service to his country,” his feeling is that of a generousaristocrat who chose to do a dangerous task. A European soldier feels that he isdoing his duty.“Isn’t my money as good as the next fellow’s?” used to be a popular Americanexpression. It would not be popular in Europe: a fortune, to be good, must beold and derived by special favor from the State; to a European, money earned bypersonal effort is vulgar, crude or somehow disreputable.Americans admire achievement; they know what it takes. Europeans regardachievement with cynical suspicion and envy. Envy is not a widespread emotion inAmerica (not yet); it is an overwhelmingly dominant emotion in Europe.When Americans feel respect for their public figures, it is the respect ofequals; they feel that a government official is a human being, just as they are,who has chosen this particular line of work and has earned a certaindistinction. They call celebrities by their first names, they refer toPresidents by their initials (like “F.D.R.” or “J.F.K.”), not in insolence oregalitarian pretentiousness, but in token of affection. The custom of addressinga person as “Herr Doktor Doktor Schmidt” would be impossible in America. InEngland, the freest country of Europe, the achievement of a scientist, abusinessman or a movie star is not regarded as fully real until he has beenclunked on the head with the State’s sword and declared to be a knight.There are practical consequences of these two different attitudes.An American economist told me the following story. He was sent to England by anAmerican industrial concern, to investigate its European branch: in spite of thelatest equipment and techniques, the productivity of the branch in England keptlagging far behind that of the parent-factory in the U.S. He found the cause: arigidly circumscribed mentality, a kind of psychological caste system, on allthe echelons of British labor and management. As he explained it: in America, ifa machine breaks down, a worker volunteers to fix it, and usually does; inEngland, work stops and people wait for the appropriate department to summon theappropriate engineer. It is not a matter of laziness, but of a profoundlyingrained feeling that one must keep one’s place, do one’s prescribed duty, andnever venture beyond it. It does not occur to the British worker that he is freeto assume responsibility for anything beyond the limits of his particular job.Initiative is an “instinctive” (i.e., automatized) American characteristic; inan American consciousness, it occupies the place which, in a European one, isoccupied by obedience.As to the differences in the social atmosphere, here is an example. An elderlyEuropean woman, a research biochemist from Switzerland, on a visit to New York,told me that she wanted to buy some things at the five-and-ten. Since she couldbarely speak English, I offered to go with her; she hesitated, lookingastonished and disturbed, then asked: “But wouldn’t that embarrass you?” Icouldn’t understand what she meant: “Embarrass—how?” “Well,” she explained, “youare a famous person, and what if somebody sees you in the five-and-ten?” Ilaughed. She explained to me that in Switzerland, by unwritten law, there aredifferent stores for different classes of people, and that she, as aprofessional, has to shop in certain stores, even though her salary is modest,that better goods at lower prices are available in the workingmen’s stores, butshe would lose social status if she were seen shopping there. Can you conceiveof living in an atmosphere of that kind? (We did go to the five-and-ten.)A European, on any social level, lives emotionally in a world made by others (henever knows clearly by whom), and seeks or accepts his place in it. The Americanattitude is best expressed by a line from a poem: “The world began when I wasborn and the world is mine to win.” (“The Westerner” by Badger Clark.)Years ago, at a party in Hollywood, I met Eve Curie, a distinguishedFrenchwoman, the daughter of Marie Curie. Eve Curie was a best-selling author ofnon-fiction books and, politically, a liberal; at the time, she was on a lecturetour of the United States. She stressed her astonishment at American audiences.“They are so happy,” she kept repeating, “so happy....” She was saying itwithout disapproval and without admiration, with only the faintest touch ofamusement; but her astonishment was genuine. “People are not like that inEurope.... Everybody is happy in America—except the intellectuals. Oh, theintellectuals are unhappy everywhere.”This incident has remained in my mind because she had named, unwittingly, thenature of the breach between the American people and the intellectuals. Theculture of a worn, crumbling Europe—with its mysticism, its lethargicresignation, its cult of suffering, its notion that misery and impotence areman’s fate on earth, and that unhappiness is the hallmark of a sensitivespirit—of what use could it be to a country like America?It was a European who discovered America, but it was Americans who were thefirst nation to discover this earth and man’s proper place in it, and man’spotential for happiness, and the world which is man’s to win. What they failedto discover is the words to name their achievement, the concepts to identify it,the principles to guide it, i.e., the appropriate philosophy and itsconsequence: an American culture.America has never had an original culture, i.e., a body of ideas derived fromher philosophical (Aristotelian) base and expressing her profound differencefrom all other countries in history.American intellectuals were Europe’s passive dependents and poor relativesalmost from the beginning. They lived on Europe’s drying crumbs and discardedfashions, including even such hand-me-downs as Freud and Wittgenstein. America’ssole contribution to philosophy—Pragmatism—was a bad recycling ofKantian-Hegelian premises.America’s best minds went into science, technology, industry—and reachedincomparable heights of achievement. Why did they neglect the field of ideas?Because it represented Augean stables of a kind no joyously active man wouldcare to enter. America’s childhood coincided with the rise of Kant’s influencein European philosophy and the consequent disintegration of European culture.America was in the position of an eager, precocious child left in the care of ascruffy, senile, decadent guardian. The child had good reason to play hooky.An adolescent can ride on his sense of life for a while. But by the time hegrows up, he must translate it into conceptual knowledge and consciousconvictions, or he will be in deep trouble. A sense of life is not a substitutefor explicit knowledge. Values which one cannot identify, but merely sensesimplicitly, are not in one’s control. One cannot tell what they depend on orrequire, what course of action is needed to gain and/or keep them. One can loseor betray them without knowing it. For close to a century, this has beenAmerica’s tragic predicament. Today, the American people is like a sleepwalkinggiant torn by profound conflicts. (When I speak of “the American people,” inthis context, I mean every group, including scientists and businessmen—exceptthe intellectuals, i.e., those whose professions deal with the humanities. Theintellectuals are a country’s guardians.)Americans are the most reality-oriented people on earth. Their outstandingcharacteristic is the childhood form of reasoning: common sense. It is theironly protection. But common sense is not enough where theoretical knowledge isrequired: it can make simple, concrete-bound connections—it cannot integratecomplex issues, or deal with wide abstractions, or forecast the future.For example, consider the statist trend in this country. The doctrine ofcollectivism has never been submitted explicity to the American voters; if ithad been, it would have sustained a landslide defeat (as the various socialistparties have demonstrated). But the welfare state was put over on Americanspiecemeal, by degrees, under cover of some undefined “Americanism”—culminatingin the absurdity of a President’s declaration that America owes its greatness to“the willingness for self-sacrifice.” People sense that something has gonewrong; they cannot grasp what or when. This is the penalty they pay forremaining a silent (and deaf) majority.Americans are anti-intellectual (with good grounds, in view of currentspecimens), yet they have a profound respect for knowledge and education (whichis being shaken now). They are self-confident, trusting, generous, enormouslybenevolent and innocent. “... that celebrated American ‘innocence’ [is] aquality which in philosophical terms is simply an ignorance of how questionablea being man really is and which strikes the European as alien ...” declares anexistentialist (William Barrett, Irrational Man). The word “questionable” is aeuphemism for miserable, guilty, impotent, groveling, evil—which is the Europeanview of man. Europeans do believe in Original Sin, i.e., in man’s innatedepravity; Americans do not. Americans see man as a value—as clean, free,creative, rational. But the American view of man has not been expressed orupheld in philosophical terms (not since the time of our first Founding Father,Aristotle; see his description of the “magnanimous man”).Barrett continues: “Sartre recounts a conversation he had with an American whilevisiting in this country. The American insisted that all international problemscould be solved if men would just get together and be rational; Sartre disagreedand after a while discussion between them became impossible. ‘I believe in theexistence of evil,’ says Sartre, ‘and he does not.’ ” This, again, is aeuphemism: it is not merely the existence but the power of evil that Europeansbelieve in. Americans do not believe in the power of evil and do not understandits nature. The first part of their attitude is (philosophically) true, but thesecond makes them vulnerable. On the day when Americans grasp the cause ofevil’s impotence—its mindless, fear-ridden, envy-eaten smallness—they will befree of all the man-hating manipulators of history, foreign and domestic.So far, America’s protection has been a factor best expressed by a sayingattributed to con men: “You can’t cheat an honest man.” The innocence and commonsense of the American people have wrecked the plans, the devious notions, thetricky strategies, the ideological traps borrowed by the intellectuals from theEuropean statists, who devised them to fool and rule Europe’s impotent masses.There have never been any “masses” in America: the poorest American is anindividual and, subconsciously, an individualist. Marxism, which has conqueredour universities, is a dismal failure as far as the people are concerned:Americans cannot be sold on any sort of class war; American workers do not seethemselves as a “proletariat,” but are among the proudest of property owners. Itis professors and businessmen who advocate cooperation with SovietRussia—American labor unions do not.The enormous propaganda effort to make Americans fear fascism but not communism,has failed: Americans hate them both. The terrible hoax of the United Nationshas failed. Americans were never enthusiastic about that institution, but theygave it the benefit of the doubt for too long. The current polls, however,indicate that the majority have turned against the U.N. (better late thannever).The latest assault on human life—the ecology crusade—will probably end in defeatfor its ideological leadership: Americans will enthusiastically clean theirstreets, their rivers, their backyards, but when it comes to giving up progress,technology, the automobile, and their standard of living, Americans will provethat the man-haters “ain’t seen nothing yet.”The sense-of-life emotion which, in Europe, makes people uncertain, malleableand easy to rule, is unknown in America: fundamental guilt. No one, so far, hasbeen able to infect America with that contemptible feeling (and I doubt thatanyone ever will). Americans cannot begin to grasp the kind of corruptionimplied and demanded by that feeling.But an honest man can cheat himself. His trusting innocence can lead him toswallow sugar-coated poisons—the deadliest of which is altruism. Americansaccept it—not for what it is, not as a vicious doctrine of self-immolation—butin the spirit of a strong, confident man’s overgenerous desire to relieve thesuffering of others, whose character he does not understand. When such a manawakens to the betrayal of his trust—to the fact that his generosity has broughthim within reach of a permanent harness which is about to be slipped on him byhis sundry beneficiaries—the consequences are unpredictable.There are two ways of destroying a country: dictatorship or chaos, i.e.,immediate rigor mortis or the longer agony of the collapse of all civilizedinstitutions and the breakup of a nation into roving armed gangs fighting andlooting one another, until some one Attila conquers the rest. This means: chaosas a prelude to tyranny—as was the case in Western Europe in the Dark Ages, orin the three hundred years preceding the Romanoff dynasty in Russia, or underthe war lords regime in China.A European is disarmed in the face of a dictatorship: he may hate it, but hefeels that he is wrong and, metaphysically, the State is right. An Americanwould rebel to the bottom of his soul. But this is all that his sense of lifecan do for him: it cannot solve his problems.Only one thing is certain: a dictatorship cannot take hold in America today.This country, as yet, cannot be ruled—but it can explode. It can blow up intothe helpless rage and blind violence of a civil war. It cannot be cowed intosubmission, passivity, malevolence, resignation. It cannot be “pushed around.”Defiance, not obedience, is the American’s answer to overbearing authority. Thenation that ran an underground railroad to help human beings escape fromslavery, or began drinking on principle in the face of Prohibition, will not say“Yes, sir,” to the enforcers of ration coupons and cereal prices. Not yet.If America drags on in her present state for a few more generations (which isunlikely), dictatorship will become possible. A sense of life is not a permanentendowment. The characteristically American one is being eroded daily all aroundus. Large numbers of Americans have lost it (or have never developed it) and arecollapsing to the psychological level of Europe’s worst rabble.This is prevalent among the two groups that are the main supporters of thestatist trend: the very rich and the very poor—the first, because they want torule; the second, because they want to be ruled. (The leaders of the trend arethe intellectuals, who want to do both.) But this country has never had anunearned, hereditary “elite.” America is still the country of self-made men,which means: the country of the middle class—the most productive and exploitedgroup in any modern society.The academia—jet set coalition is attempting to tame the American character bythe deliberate breeding of helplessness and resignation—in those incubators oflethargy known as “Progressive” schools, which are dedicated to the task ofcrippling a child’s mind by arresting his cognitive development. (See “TheComprachicos” in my book Rise of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution).It appears, however, that the “progressive” rich will be the first victims oftheir own social theories: it is the children of the well-to-do who emerge fromexpensive nursery schools and colleges as hippies, and destroy the remnants oftheir paralyzed brains by means of drugs.The middle class has created an antidote which is perhaps the most helpfulmovement of recent years: the spontaneous, unorganized, grass-roots revival ofthe Montessori system of education—a system aimed at the development of achild’s cognitive, i.e., rational, faculty. But that is a long-range prospect.At present, even so dismal a figure as President Nixon is a hopefulsign—precisely because he is so dismal. If any other country were in asdesperately precarious a state of confusion as ours, a dozen flamboyant Führerswould have sprung up overnight to take it over. It is to America’s credit thatno such Führer has appeared, and if any did, it is doubtful that he would have achance.Can this country achieve a peaceful rebirth in the foreseeable future? By allprecedents, it is not likely. But America is an unprecedented phenomenon. In thepast, American perseverance became, on occasion, too long-bearing a patience.But when Americans turned, they turned. What may happen to the welfare state iswhat happened to the Prohibition Amendment.Is there enough of the American sense of life left in people—under the constantpressure of the cultural-political efforts to obliterate it? It is impossible totell. But those of us who hold it, must fight for it. We have no alternative: wecannot surrender this country to a zero—to men whose battle cry is mindlessness.We cannot fight against collectivism, unless we fight against its moral base:altruism. We cannot fight against altruism, unless we fight against itsepistemological base: irrationalism. We cannot fight against anything, unless wefight for something—and what we must fight for is the supremacy of reason, and aview of man as a rational being.These are philosophical issues. The philosophy we need is a conceptualequivalent of America’s sense of life. To propagate it, would require thehardest intellectual battle. But isn’t that a magnificent goal to fight for?072 [rand_9781101137253_oeb_072_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"RECOMMENDED READINGSAYN RAND’S NOVELSWe the Living (1936).
