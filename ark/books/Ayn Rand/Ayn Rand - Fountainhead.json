Only Man is an end in him- self.\" Are there any substantial changes I would want to make in The Fountainhead? No-and. therefore, I have left its text untouched. I want it to stand as it was wiitten. But there is one ·minor error and one possibly misleading sentence which I should like to clar- ify, so I shall mention them here. · The error is semantic: the use of the word \"egotist\" in Roark's courtroom· speech, while actually the word should have been \"egoist.\" The error was caused by my reliance on a dictionary which gave such misleading definitions of these two words that \"egotist\" seemed cwser to the meaning I intended .(Websters Daily Use Dictionary, 1933). (Modern philosophers, however, are guiltier than lexicographers in regard to these two terms.) The possibly misleading sentence is in'Roark's speech: \"From this simpl~ necessity to the highest religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man-the function of his reasoning mind.\" · · This ((ould be misinterpreted to mean an endorsement of reli- gion or religious ideas. I remember hesitating over that sentence, when I wrote it, and deciding that Roark's and my atheism, as well as the averall spirit of the book, were so clearly established that no one would misunderstand it, particularly since I said that religious abstractions are the product of man's mind, not of su- pernatural revelation. But an issue of this sort should not be left to implications. What I was referring to was not religion as such, but a special category of abstractions, the most exalted one, which, for centu- ries, bad been the near-monopoly of religion: ethics-not the par- ticular content of religious ethics, but the abstraction \"ethics,\" the realm of values, man's code of good and evil,.with the emotional conno~ations of height, uplift, nobility, reverence, grandeur, which pertain to the realm of man's values, but which religion bas arrogated to itself. The same meaning and considerations were intended and are applicable to another passage of the book, a brief dialogne be- tween Roark and Hopton StOddard, which may be misunderstood if taken out of context: · \"'You're a profoundly religious man, Mr. Roark-in your own way. I can see that in your buildings.' \"'That's true,' said Roark.\" In the context of that scene, however, the meaning is clear: it is Roark's profound dedication to values, to the highest and best, to the ideal, that Stoddard is referring to (see his explanation of the nature of the proposed temple). The erection of the Stoddard Temple arid the subsequent trial state the issue explicitly. This leads me to a wider issue which is involved in every line viii"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"of The Fountainhead and which has to be ·understood if one wants to understand the causes of its. lasting appeal. · Religion's monopoly in the field of ethics has made it ex- tremely difficult to communicate the emotional meaning and con- notations of a rational view of life. Just as religion has preempted the . field of ethics, turning morality against man, so it has usurped the highest moral concepts of our language, placing them. outside this earth and beyond man's reach. \"Exaltation\" is _ usually taken to mean ari emotional state evoked by contemplat-· ing the supernatural. \"Worship\" means _the emotional experience of loyalty and dedication to something higher than man. \"~ever­ ence\" means the emotimr of a sacred respect, to be experienced - on one's knees. \"Sacred\" means superior to and not-to-6e'- touched-by any coneems of man or of this earth.

The man-worshipers, in my sense of the term, are those who see milQ's highest potential and strive to actualize it. The man- haters are those who regard man as a helpless, depraved, con- temptible creature-and struggle never to let him discover otherwise. It is important here to remember that the only direct, introspective knowledge of man anyone possesses is of himself. More specifically, the essential division bet\\Yeen these two camps is: those dedicated to the exaltation of man's self-esteem and the sacredness of his happiness on earth-and those deter- mined not to allow either to become possible. The majority of mankind spend their lives and psychological energy in the mid- dle, swinging between these two, struggling not to allow the is- sue to be named. This does not change the nature of .the issue. Perhaps the. ·best way to communicate The Fountainhead's sense of life is. by means of the quotation which had stood at the head. of my manuscript, but which I removed from tlie final, pub- lished book. With this opportunity to explain it, I am glad to bring· it back. · · · I removed· it, becaUse of my profound disagreement With the philosophy Of its author, Friedrich Nietzsche. Philosophically, Nietzsche is a mystic and an irrationalist. His metaphysics con- sists {Jf a somewhat \"Byronic\" and mystically \"malevolent\" uni- verse; his epistemology .subordinates reason to \"will,\" or feeling or instinct or blood or innate virtUes of character. But, as a poet, he projects'at times (not consistently) a_magnificent feeling for ·man's. greatness, expressed in emotional, not intellectual terms. This is especially true. Of tile quotati()n I had chosen. I could not endorse its ·literal meaning: it proclaims an indefensible tellet-PsYchological.determinism. But if one takes it as a.poetic projection of an emotional experience (and if, intenectually, one substitutes .the. concept of ali acquired ''basic premise\"· for the concept of ail innate \"fUildamenta:I certainty\"), then that quotation communicates the innet state of an exalted self-esteem-:-and sums ~p the emotional conseque~ces for which ~ FoUritain- head p.-ovides the rational, philosophical base: . \"It is not the works, bot the belief which is here deciSive alld determines . the order of rank-to. employ once more ali old reli- gious formlila with a new and deeper meaning,-it is some ·fun- damental certaiD.ty which a noble solil bas about i~lf. s,Oinething whic}J. is not to be sought, is not to be found, and. perhaps, also, is not to be lost.-71ze noble soul has reverence for itself.-\" (Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil.) .

It is not even a view, for most of them, but a foggy, groping, un- defined sense made of raw pain and incommunicable happiness. It is a sense of enormous expectation, the sense that one's life is important, that great achievements are wi~ one's capacity, and that great things lie ahead. · It is not in the nature of man-nor of any living entity-to start out by giving up, by spitting in one's own face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption who8e rapidity differs from man to man. Some give up at the first touch of pres- sure; some sell out; some run down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their elders who tell them persistently that matUrity consists of abandoning one's mind;· se- curity, of abandoning one's values; practicalitr,, of losing . self- esteem. Yet a few hold on and move OQ. knowing that that fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek a noble vision of man's nature and of life's potential. There are very few guideposts to find. The Fountainhead iS ( one of them. This is one of· the cardinal reasons of The Fountainheilil's laSt- ing appeal: it is a confirmation of the spirit of youth, proclaiming man's glory, showing how much is possible. It does not matter th~t only a few in each generation will grasp and achieve the full reality of man's proper statllre-'-and that the rest will betray it. It is 1ho8e few that move the world and give life its meaning-and it is those few that I have always sought to address.

The stone glowed, wet with sumays. The lake below was only a thin steel ring that cut the ~ks in half. The rocks went on into the depth, unchanged. They began and ended in the sky. So that the world seemed susj)en~ in space. an island floating -on nothing, anchored to the feet of the man on the cliff. · · His body leaned back against the sky.

He felt his shoulder blades drawn tight together, the ctirve of his neck, and the weight of the blood in his. hands. He felt the wind behind him, in the hollow of his spine.

It had high ((heekbones over gaunt, hollow cheeks; gray eyes, cold and steady; a contemptuous mouth, shut tight, the mouth of an executioner or a saint. He looked at tbe granite. To be cut, he thought, and made into walls. He looked at a tree. To be·split and made into rafters. He looked at a streak of rust on the stone and thought of ·iron ore under the ground. To be melted and to emerge as girders against the sky. These rocks, he thought; are here for me; waiting for the drill, the dynamite and my voice; waiting to be split, ripped, pounded, reborn; waiting for the shape my hands will give them. Then he shook his head, because he remembered that morning and that there were many things to. be done. He stepped to the edge, raised his arms,. and dived down into the sky below. He cut straight across the lake to the shore ahead. He reached the rocks where he had left his clothes. He looked regretfully about him. For thtee years, ever since he had lived in Stanton, he had come here for his only relaxation, to swim, to rest, to think, to be alone. and alive, whenever he could find one hour to spare, which had not been often. In his new freedom the first thing he . had wanted to do was to come here, because he knew that he was coming for the last time. That morning he had been expelled from the Architectural School of the Stanton Institute of Technol- ogy. . . . He pulled his clothes on: old denim trousers, sandals, a shirt with short sleeves and most of its buttons missing. He swung down a narrow trail among the boulders, to a path running through a green slope, to the road below. He walked swiftly, with a loose, lazy expertness of motion. He walked down the long road, in the sun. Far ahead Stanton lay sprawled on. the coast of Massachusetts, a little town as a setting for the gem of its existence-the great institute rising on a hill beyond. The township of Stanton began with a dump. A gray mound of refuse rose in the grass. It smoked faintly. Tin cans glittered in the sun. 'the road led past the first houses to a church. The church was a Gothic monument of shingles painted pigeon blue. It had stout wooden buttresses supporting nothing. It .had stained- glass windows with heavy traceries of imitation stone. It opened the way into long streets edged by tight, exhibitionist lawns. Be- hind the lawns stood wooden piles tortured out of all shape: twisted into gables, · turrets, dormers-; bulging with porches; crushed under huge, sloping roofs. White curtains floated at the windows. A garbage can stood at a side door, flowing over. An old Pekinese sat upon a cushion· on a door step, its mouth drooling. A line of diapers fluttered in the wind between the col- umns of a porch. People turned to look at Howard Roark as he passed. Some re- 16"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"mained staring after him with sudden resentment. They could_ give no reason for it: it was an instinct his presence awakened in most people. Howard Roark saw no one. For· him, the streets were empty: He could have walked there naked without concern. He crossed the heart of Stanton, a broad green_ edged by shop windows. The windows displayed new placards announcing: WEl.COME TO THE CLASS OF '22! GOOD LUCK, CLASS OF '22! The Class .of '22 of the Stanton Institute of Technology· was holding its cOmmencement exercises that afternoon. · Roark swung into a side street, where at the end of a long row, on a knoll over a green. ravine, stOQd the hou$e of Mrs. Keating. He had bOarded at _that house for three years. Mrs. Keating was out on the porch. She was feeding a couple of canaries in a cage suspended over the railing. Her P-udgy little hand stopped in mid-air when she ~aw him. She watched lilin with curiosiiy.

But it boasted green marble dadoes, Corinthian columns of cast iron painted. gold, and gar- . lands of gllded fruit on the walls; the pineapples particularly, thought Guy Francon, had stood the test of years very well. It is, thought Guy Francon, touching; it was I who built this imnex and this. very hall,· twenty years ~go; and here I am. . The hall was packed with bodies and fjlees, so tightly that one could not distinguiSh at .a glance which faces belonged to which bodies. It was like a soft, Shivering aspic made of mixed arms, shoulders, chests and sromaehs; ·One of the heads,· pale, dark haired and beautiful, belonpi to Peter Keating. He sat, well in front, trymg to keep his eyes on the platform, because he knew that many people were looking at bini and would Jook at him later. He did not glance back, but· the con- s_ciou~ness of those centered glances never left him. H~s eyes were dark, alert, intelligent. His mouth, a small upturned cres- cent faultlessly traced, was gentle and generous, and warm with 28"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the faint promise of a smile. His head had a certain classical perfection in the shape of the skull, in the natural wave of black ringlets about finely hollowed temples. He held his head in the manner of one who takes his beauty for granted, but knows that others do -not. He was Peter Keating, star student of Stanton, president of the student body, captain of the track team; mem- ber of the most important fraternity, voted the most popular man on the campus. __ - - _ , __ The crowd wali there; thought Peter Keating,. to see bini grad- uate, and be tried to estimate the capacity of the hall. They knew of his scholastic record arid no one would beat his record today. Oh, well~ there was Shlinker. Shlinker had given him stiff com- petition, but he had beaten Shlinker this last year. He had worked like a dog; beCause he bad wanted to beat Shlinker. fle·IWf)lo ri~ vals today .... Then he felt suddenly as if S()m!'tbing had fallen down, inside his throat, to his stomach; 0 something co~d _-and empty, a blank hole rolling down_ and leaVing that feeling on itS way: not a thought, just the· hint- of a question asking -him whether he· was really as great as this day would proclaim him to be. He looked for Shlinker in the crowd;_ he saw his yellow face and gold-rimmed glasses. He stared at Shlinker warmly, in relief; in reassunmee, in gratitude. It was_ obvious that Shlinker could never hope to equal his own appearance or ability; he gad noth- ing to doubt; he would aiways beat Shlinker and all the. Shlinkei'S of the woi'ld; he would let no one achieve what he could not achieve.· Let them all watch ·him. He would give them good rea- son to sta:re; He felt the hot breaths 'about him and the expecta- tion, like a: tonic. It was wondeiful, thought Peter Keating, to be a:live. - - · His head was begimfing to reel a little.' It was a pleasant feel- ing. The feeling carried him, unresisting and unremembering, to the platform in front ofall those faces. He stood-slender,·trim, athleti~and_ let the deluge break upon his head. He gathered from its roar that he had graduated with honors, that the Archi- tects'_ Guild of America had presented bini with a gold medal and dlat he bad ~n awarded the Prix de Paris by the Society for Ar- chitectural Enlightenment of the U.S.A.-a four-year scholarship at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. · Then he- WaS shaking bands, scratching the perspiration off his face with the end of a rolled parchment, nodding, smiling, suffo- cating in his black gowB and hoping that people would not notice his mother sobbing with her arms about him._ The PreSident of the fustitute shook his hand, booming: \"Stanton will be proud of you, my boy.\" The Dean Shook his hand, repeating: \" ... a glo- rious futUre ... a glorioUs future ... a glorious future ... \"Pro- fessor Peterkin shook his hand, and patted his shoulder, saying: \", .. and you'll find it absolutely essential; for example, I had the experience when.

It was the only structUre .ariyone had ever known Pr:ofessor Peterkin .to have erected, before he sacrificed his practice to the responsibilities of teaching. A great deal was said about Keating's final project-a Palace of Fine Arts. For the life ofhim, Keating· could not remember at the mo- ment what. that project was. . . . . . . .. · Through all this, his eyes held the vision of Guy Francon shak- ing his hand, and his ears held the sounds of Francon's mellow voice: \"... as I have. told you, it is still open, my boy. Of course •. now that you have this scholarship . . . you will have to decide ... a Beaux-Arts diploma js very. impqrtant to a young man ... but I should be delighted to have you in our office .... \" The banquet of the Class of '22 'was long and solemn. Keating listened· to the speeches with in~rest; when he heard the endless sentences aboUt ''young men as the hope of Alperican Architec- ture\" and \"the future opening its golden gates,\" he knew that he was the bope.and })is WaS the future, and it was pleasant to bear this confirmation from so many ,eminent lips. lie looked at the gray-haired orators and thought of bow much y()unger he would be when he reached their positions, theirs aitd beyond them. Then he thought s1,1ddenly of lloward Roark. lie was surprised to find that the flash of that name in his memory gave him a sharp little twinge· of pleasure, before he could know why. Then he remembered: lloward Roark had been· expelled this morning. lie reproached himself silently; he made a determined effort to feel sorry. But the secret glow came. back,. whenever he thought of that expulsion. The event proved conclusively that he had been a fool to imagine Roark a dangerous iival; at one time, he had worried about Roark more than about Shlinker, even though Roark was two .years younger and one class below him. If he had ever entertained any doubts on their respective gifts,. hadn't this day settled it all? And, he remembered, Roark had been very nice ·. to him, helping him whenever be was stuck on a problem ... not stuck, really, just did not have the time to thinkJt out, a plan or ~omething. Christ! how Roark could untangle a plan, like pulling a string and it was open ... well, what if he coUld? What did it get him? He was done for now. And knowing this, Peter Keating experienced at last ~ satisfying . pang of sympathy for ·Howard Roark. · . . .. When Keating was called upon to speJik, he rose confidently. He could not show that he was terrified. He had nothing to say -about architecture. But he spoke, his head high, as 1jn equal among equals, just sUbtly diffident, so that no great name .present could take offense. He remembered saying: . \"ArchitectUre is a great art .. , with our eyes .to the future and the reverence of the past in our hearts ... of all the crafts, the most important one so- ciologically . . . and, as the man who is an inspiration to us all 30"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"has said today, the three eternal entities are: Truth, Love and Beauty.: •. \" . The11, in the corridors outside~ in the noisy confusion ofleave- taking, a boy had thrown an arm about Keating's shoulders and · whispered: \"Run on home and get out of the soup-and-fish, Pete, and it's Boston for us tonight, just our own gang; I'll pick you up • fu an hour.\" Ted Shlinker had ilrged: \"Of course you're coming, Pete. No fun without you. Aitd, by the way, congratulations and all that sort of tliing. No hard feelings. May the best man win.\" Keating had thrown .his ann about Shlink~?r's shoulders; Keating's eyes had glowed with an insistent kind of warmth, as if Shlfuker were his most precious friend; Keating's eyes glQw~ ·like that on everybody. He had said: \"Thanks, Ted, old man. I re- ally do feel awful about the A.G.A. medal-I think you were the one for it, but ypu never· can tell what possesses those old fo- gies.\" And now Keating was oil his way home through the soft darkness, wondering how to get away from his mother for the night. . . His mother, .he thought; had done a great deal for him. As she pointed out frequently, she was a lady and had gt'llduated from high school; yet she had wo~ed ·hard, had taken. boarders into their home, a concession unprecedented in her family. His father had owned a stationery store in Stanton. Changing times had ended the business and a hernia had ended Peter Keating, Sr., twelve years ago. Louisa Keating had been left with the home that stOod at the end. of a respectable street, an annuity from an insurance kept up accurately-she had seen to that-:-ail.d her son. The annuity .was a modest one, but with.the help of the boarders and of a tenacious . purpose Mrs. Keating had managed. In the summerS her son helped; clerking in hotels or prising for hat advertisements. Her son, Mrs. Keating bad deCided, would assume his rightful place in the world, and she had clung to this as softly, as inexorably as a leech .... It's funny, Keating remem- bered, at one titne he had wanted to be an artist. It was his mother who had chosen a better field in which to exeicise his tal- ent for drawing. \"Architecture,\" she had said, \"is such a respect- able profession. Besides, you meet the best people in it.\" She had pushed him into his career, he had never known when or how. It's funny, thought Keating, he had not remembered that youthful ambition of his for years. It's funny that it should hurl: him now-to remember. Well, this was the night to remem~r it-and to forget it forever. · Architects, he thought, always made brilliant careers. And once on top, did they ever fail? Suddenly, he recalled Henry Cameron; builder of skyscrapers twenty years ago; old drunkard with offices on some waterfront today. Keating shuddered and walked faster. · . He wondered, as he walked, whether people were looking at 31"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"him. He watched the rectangles of lighted win<Jows; when a cur- . tain fluttered and a head leaned out, he tried to guess ~whether it had leaned to watch his passing; if it hadn't, some day it would; some day, they all would~ . Howard Roark was- sitting on the porch steps when Keating approached the house. He was leaning back against the steps, propped up on his elbows, his long· legs stretched out. A morning-glory climbed over the porch pillars, as a curtain be- tween the house and the light of a lamppost on the comer. It was strange to see an electric globe in the air of a spring night. It made . the street darker and softer;· it hung alone, like a . gap, and left nothing to be seen but a Jew branches heavy with leaves, standing still at the gap's edges. The small hint became immense, as if the darkness held nothing but a flood of leaves. The mechanical ball of glass made the leaves seem more living; it took away their color and gave the promise that in daylight they would be .a brighter green than had ever existed; it took a.way one's sight and left a new sense instead, neither smell nor touch, yet bOth, a sense of spring and space. Keating stopped when he recognized the preposterous orange hair in the darkness of the porch. It was the one person whom he had wanted to see tonight.· He was glad to find Roark alone, and a little afraid .of it. · \"Congratulations, Peter,\" said Roark. ''Oh •.. Oh, thanks .... \" Keating was surprised to find that he felt more pleasure than from any other compliment he had re- ceived today. He was timidly glad that Roark approved, and he called himself inwardly a fool for it. \" ... I mean ... do you know or ... \" He added sharply: \"Has mother been telling you?'' \"She has.\" \"She shouldn't have!\" \"Why not?'' \"Look, Howard, you know that I'm terribly sorry about your being .... \". . . · . Roark threw his head back and looked up at him. ''Forget it,\" said Roark. ''I .... there's something I want to speak to you about, Howard, to ask your advice. Mind if I sit down?'' · ''What is it?'' . . Keating sat down on the steps beside him. There was no part that he could ever.play in Roark's presence. Besides, he did not feel like playing a part now. He heard a leaf rustling in its fall to the earth; it was a thin, glassy, spring sound. He knew, for the moment, that he felt affection for Roark; an affection that held pain, astonishment and helplessness. \"You won't think,\" said Keating gently, in -complete sincerity, ''that it's awful of me to be asking about my business, when you've just been ... ?\" 32"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\"I said forget about that. What is it?\" \"You know,\" said Keating. honestly and unexpeetedly even to himself, \"I've often thought that you're crazy. aut I know that you know many things about it.:.....architecture, I mean-which those fools never knew. And I know that you love it as they never will.\" . - ''Well?\" _ . ''Well, I don't know w~y I should come to you, but-Howard, I've never said it before, but you see, l'd rather have your opi~- . ion on things than ilie Dean's--I'd probably follow the Dean's, but it's just that yours means more to :me myself, I don't know why. I don'.t know- why I'm saying this, either.\" · Roark turned over on his. side, looked at him, and laugh~. It was a young, .kind, friendly laughter, a thing so rare to hear from· Roark_ that_ Keating felt ill;- if someone had taken his hand in re- assurance; and he forgot that he had a party in Boston waiting for him. _ .- _ . - · \"Come on,\" said Roark, ''you're not being afraid. of me, are you? What do you want to ask about?\" \"It's about my scholarship. The Paris prize I got.\" \"Yes?\" · \"It's for four years. But, on the other hand, Guy Francon of- fered me a job with him some time ago. Today he said it's still · open. And l:don't know which to take.\" · Roark looked at him; Roark's fingers-moved in' slow rotation, beating against the steps. · . · ''H you want my advice, Peter,\" he said at last, ''you've made a mistake already.

But he rose to his feet. · She seemed not to have heard. She walked into the house. Keating followed. . Roark looked after them, slitugged, rose and went in also. Mrs. Keating settled down in an armchair, her stiff skirt crack- ling. \"Well?\" she asked. \"What were you two discussing out there?\" Keating fingered an ash tray, picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then, ignoring her, turned to Roark. \"Look, Howard, drop the pose,\" he said, his voice high. \"Shall I junk the scholarship and go to work, or let Francon wait and grab the Beaux-Arts to impress the yokels? What do you think?\" Something was gone. The one moment was lost. ''Now, Petey, let me ge~ this straight ..• \" began Mrs. Keating. \"Oh, wait a minute, Mother! ... Howard, I've got to weigh it carefully.It isn't everyone who can get a scholarship like that. You're pretty good when you rate that.

Ideals aside for a moment, it certainly is •.. \" \"You don't want my advice,\" said Roark. \"Of course I do! I'm asking you!\" But Keating could never be the same when he had an audi- ence, any audience. Something was gone. He did not know it, but he felt that Roark knew; Roark's eyes made him uncomfortable and that made him angry. \"I want to practice architecture,\" snapped Keating, \"not talk about it! Gives you a great prestige-the old Ecole. Puts you above the rank and file of the ex-plumbers who think they can build. On the other hand, an opening with Francon-Guy Francon himself offering it!\" Roark turned away. \"How many boys will match· that?\" Keating went on blindly. \"A year from now they'll be boasting they're working for Smith or Jones if they find work at all. While I'll be with _!rancon & Heyer!\" ' \"You're quite right, Peter,\" said Mrs. Keating, rising. \"On a question like that you don't want to consult your mother. It's too important. I'll leave you to settle. it with Mr. Roark.\" He looked at his mother. He did not want to hear what she thought of this; he knew that his only . chance to decide was to make the decision before he heard her; she had stOpped, _looking at him, ready to tum and leave the room; he knew it was not a pose-she would leave if he wished it; he wanted her to go; he wanted it desperately. He said: 34"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"- \"Why, Mother, how can you say that? Of course I want your opinion. What . . . what do you think?\" She ignored the raw irritation in his voice.

It's nothing to -me.'' \"Mother, you want me to take the job with Francon?\" \"I don't want anything, Petey. You're the boss.\" He wondered whether he really liked his mother. But she was his mother and this fact was reeogaized by everybody_ as mean- ing automatically that he loved her, and so he took for granted that whatever he felt for her was love. He did not know whether there was any reason why he should respect her judgment. She was his mother; _this was supposed to take the place ofteasons. \"Yes, of course, Mother .... But ... Yes, I know, but . ·.'.How- ard?\" ' It was a plea for help. Roark was there, on a davenport in the comer, half lying, sprawled limply like a kitten. It had often as- tonished Keating; he had seen Roark moving· wii:h the soundless tension, the .control, the precision of a cat; he had seen'him re- laxed, like a cat, in shapeless ease, as if his body held no single solid bone. Roark glanced up at him. He said: _ \"Peter, you know how I feel about either one of your- opportu- nities. Take your choice of the lesser evil. Wbat·will you learn at the Beaux-Arts?

It .was a miniature Doric portico, every inch of it scal.ed down to the ex- act proportions decreed by the IU\"tists who had worn flowing Gre- cian tunics; . between the marble perfection of the coluiDDs ·a revolving door sparkled with nickel-plate, reflecting the streats .n"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"of automobiles flying past. Keating walked through· the revolving door, through the lustrous marble lobby, to an elevator of gilt and red lacquer that brought him, thirty floors later, to a mahogany door. He saw a slender brass plate with delicate letters: FRANCON & HEYER, ARCHITECfS. The reception room of the office of Fi'ancon & Heyer, Archi- tects, looked like a cool, intimate ballroom in a Colonial man- sion. The silver white walls were paneled with flat pilasters; the pilasters were fluted and curved into Ionic snails; they supported little pediments broke·n in the middle to make room for half a Grecian urn plastered against the wall. Etehings of Greek temples ado~ed the panels, too small to be distinguished, but presenting the unmistakable columns, pediments and crumbling stone. Quite in~ongruously, Keating felt as if a conveyor belt was under his feet, from the moment he crossed the threshold. It car- ried him to~ the reception clerk who sat at a telephone switchboard behind the white balustrade of a Florentine balcony. It transferred him to the threshold of a huge drafting rooni. He saw long, flat tables, a forest of twisted rods descending from the ceiling to end in. green-shaded _lamps, enormous blueprint files,· towers of yel- low drawers, p~pets, tin boxes, sample bricks, pots of glue and calendars from conlltruc~on companies; most of them bearing pictures qf naked women. The chief draftsman snapped at Keating, without guite seeing him. He was bored and crackling with purpose simultaneously: He jerked his thumb in the direc- tion of a locker room, thrust his chin out toward the door of a locker,. and stood, rocking from heels to toes, while Keating pulled a pearl-gray smock over his stiff, uncertain body. Francon had insisted on that smock. The conveyor belt stopped at a table in a corner of the drafting room, where Keating found himself with a set of plans to expand, the scaggy back of the chief · draftsman retreating from him in the unmistakable manner of having forgotten his existence. Keating bent over his task at once, his eyes· fixed, his throat· rigid. He saw nothing but the pearly shimmer of the paper before him. The steady lines he drew silrprised him, for he felt certain that his hand was jerking an inch back and forth across the sheet. He followed the lines, not knowing where they led or why. He knew only that the plan was someone's tremendous achievement which he could neither question nor. equal. He wondered why he bad ever thought of himself as a potential architect. · Much later, he noticed the wrinkles Qf a gray smock sticking to a pair of shoulder blades over the next table. He glanced about him, cautiously at first, then with curiosity, then with pleasure, then with contempt. When he reached this last, Peter Keating be- came himself again and felt love for mankind. He noticed sallow 38"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"cheeks, a funny nose, a wart on a receding chin, a stomach squashed11gainst the edge of a table. He loved these sights. What these could do, he could do better. He smiled. Peter Keating needed his fellow men. · When he glanced at his plans again, he noti~ed the flaws glar- ing at him from the masterpiece. It was. the floor of a private res- idence, and he noted the twisted hallways that sliced great hunks of space for no apparent reason, the long, rectangular sausages of rooms doomed to darkness. Jesus, he thought, they'd have flunked me for this in the first-term. After which, he proceeded · with his work swiftly, easily, expertly-and happily. Before lunchtime. Keating had made friends.in the room, not · any definite friends, I?ut a vague soil spread and ready from which friendship would spring. He had smiled at his neighbors and winked in understanding over nothing at all. He had used each trip to the water cooler to caress those he passed with the soft, cheering glow of his eyes, the brilliant eyes that seemed to pick each man in turn out of the room, out of the uni~erse, as the most important specimen of humanity and as Keating's dearest friend There goes-there seemed to be left in his wake-a smart boy and a hell of a .good fellow. · _ Keating noticed that a tall blond youth at the ne~ table was doing the elevation of an office building. KeatingJeaned :with chummy respect against the boy's shouJ4erand looked at the lau- rel garlands entwined about fluted c:Qlumns three ftoors high. \"Pretty good for the old man,\" said Keating with admiration. \"Who?\" asked the boy. _ \"Why, Francon,\" said Keating. \"Francon hell,\" said the boy placidly: \"He hasn't designe4 a doghouse in eight years.\" He jerked his thumb over his shoulder, at a glass door behind them. \"Him.\" ·, . \"What?\" asked Keating, turning. . . \"Him/' said the boy. \"Stengel. He does_all these things.\" Behind the glass door Keating saw a pair of bony shoUlders above the edge .of a desk, a small, triangular he~td bc;nt intently, and two blank pools of-light in the round fr!lJDes of glasses. It was late in the afternoon when a presence seemed to have passed beyond the closed door, and Keating learned from the rus- tle of whispers around him that Guy Francon bad arrived and bad risen to his office on the ftoor above. Half an hour later the glass door opened and Stengel came out, a huge piece of cardboard dangling between his fingers. . \"Hey, you,\" be said, his glasses stopping .on Keating's face. \"You doing the plans for this?\" He swung the cardboard forward. ''Take this up to the boss for the okay. Try to listen to what he'll say and try to look intelligent Neither of which matters anyway.\" He was short and his arms seemed to bang down to his ankles; arms swinging like ropes in the long sleeves, with big, efficient 39"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"hands. Keating's eyes froze, darkening, for one-tenth of a second, gathered in a tight stare at the blank lenses. Then Keating smiled and said pleasantly: \"Yes, sir.\" He carried the cardboard on the tips of his ten fingers, up the crimson-plushed stairway to Guy Francon's office. The cardboard displayed a water-color perspective of a gray granite mansion with three tiers of dormers, five balconies, four bays, twelve columns, one flagpole and tWo lions at the entrance. In the comer, neatly printed by hand, stood: \"Residence of Mr. and Mrs. James S. Whattles. Francon & Heyer, Architects.\" Keating whistled softly: James S. Whattles was the multimillionaire manufacturer of shav- ing lotions. Guy Fr~con's office was polished. No, thought Keating, not polished; but shellacked; no, not shellacked, but liquid with mir- rors melted and poured over every object. He saw splinters of his own reflection let loose like a swarm of butterflies, following him across. the room, on the Chippendale cabinets, on the Jaco- bean chairs, on the Louis XV mantelpiece. He had time to note a genuine Roman statue in a comer, sepia photographs of the Parthenon, .of Rheims Cathedral, of Versailles and of the Frink National Bank Building with the eternal torch. He saw his own legs approaching him in the side of the mas- sive mahogany desk. Guy Francon sat behind the desk. Guy Francon's face was yellow and his cheeks sagged. He looked at Keating for an instant as if he had never seen him before, then remembered and smiled expansively. \"Well, well, well, Kittredge, my boy, here we are, all set and at home! So glad to see you. Sit down, boy, sit down, what have you got there? Well, there's .no hurry, no hurry at all. Sit down. How do you like it here?\" . \"I'm afraid, sir, that I'm a little too happy,\" said Keating, with an expression of frank, boyish helplessness. \"I thought I could be I,Jusinesslike on my first job, but starting in a place IiJce this . · ..

But ... but look, it would mean diminishing the fen- ·estration, wouldn't it?\" \"Yes,\" said Keating, a fairit coating of diffidence over the tone he had used in discussions with his classmates, \"but wiridows are less important than the dignity of a building's fa~ade.\" \"That's right.

Sometimes, a rare country vis- itor would come upon it unexpectedly i~ the moonlight and stop and wonder from what dream'that vision had come. But such vis- . itors were rare. The tenants of the Dana Building said that they would not exchange it for any structure on earth; they appreci- ated the light, the air, the beautiful logic of the plan in their halls · and offices. But the tenants of the Dana Building were not nu- merous; no prominent man wished his business to be located in a building that looked \"like a warehouse.\" The Dana Building had been designed by Henry Cameron. In the eighteen-eighties, the architects of New York fought one another ·for second place in their profession. No one aspired to the first. The frrst was held by Henry Cameron. Henry Cameron was hard to get in those days. He had a waiting list two years in advance; he designed personally every structure that left his of- fice. He chose what he wished to build. When he built, a client kept his mouth shut. He demanded of all people the one thing he had never granted anybody: obedience. He went through the years of his fame like a projectile flying to a goal no one could guess. People called him crazy. But they took what he gave them, whether they understood it or not, because it was a building \"by Henry Cameron.\" At frrst, his buildings were merely a little different, not enough to frighten anyone. He made startling experiments, once in a while, but people expected it and one did not argue with Henry Cameron. Something was growing in him with each· new build- ing, struggling, taking shape, rising dangerously to an explosion. The explosion came with the birth of the skyscraper. When struc- . tures began to rise not in tier on ponderous tier of masonry, but as arrows of steel shooting upward without weight or limit, Henry Cameron was among the first to understand this new mir~ . acle and to give it form. He was among the frrst and the few \\YPO accepted the truth that a tall building must look tall.

While architects drew friezes and pediments, Henry Cameron decided that the sky- scraper must not copy the Greeks. Henry Cameron decided that no building must copy any other. - He was thirty-nine years old then, short, stocky, unkempt; he worked- like a dog, missed his sleep and meals, drank seldom but then brutally, called his clients unprintable names, laughed at ha- tred and fanned it deliberately, behaved like a feudal lord and a longshoreman, and lived in a passionate tension that stung men 44"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"in any room he entered, a fire neither they nor .he could endure much longer. ·n was the year 1892. .

Yes, quite possible. • . • You're a smart boy, Peter.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Francon.\" Keating made a movement to rise. ''Wait Don't go. One more cigarette and then we'll both return to the drudgery.\" Francon was smiling over the. article, reading it again. Keating had never seen him so pleased; no drawing in the office, no work accomplished had ever made him as Juwpy as these words from another man on a printed page to be read by !)ther eyes. Keating sat easily in .a comfortable chair. His month with the firm had .been well spent. He had said nothing and done nothing, but the impression had spread through the office that Guy Francon liked to see this particular boy sent to him whenever . anyone had to be sent. Hardly a day passed without the pleasant interlude of sitting across the desk from. Guy Francon, in a re- spectful. growing intimacy, listening to Francon's sighs about.the necessity of ~ing surrounded by men who understood him. Keating had learned all he could learn about Guy Francon, from his fello:w draftsmen. He had learned that Guy Francon ate moderately and exquisitely, and prided· himself on the title of gourmet; that he had graduated with distinction from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts; that he had married a great deal of money and that the marriage had not been a happy one; that he matched me- ticulously his socks with his handkerchiefs, but never with his neckties; that he had a great preference for designing buildings of gray granite; that he owned a quarry of gray granite in Connect- icut, which did a thriving business; that he maintained a magnif- icent bachelor apartment done in plum-colored Louis XV; that . his wife, of a distinguished old name, had died, leaving her for- tune to their only daughter; that the daughter, now nineteen, was away at college. These last facts in~rested Keating a great deal. He mentioned to. Francon, tentatively in passing, the. subject of his daughter. \"Oh, yes ... \" Francon said thinly. \"Yes, indeed ... \" Keating abandoned all· further research into the matter, for the time being; Francon's face had declared that the thought of his daughter was painfully annoying tl;) him, for some reason which Keating could not discover. Keating had met Lucius N. Heyer, Francon's partner, and had seen him come to the office twice in three weeks, but had been unable to learn what service Heyer rendered to the firm. Heyer did not have haemophilia, but looked as though he should have it. He was a withered aristocrat, with a. long, thin neck, pale, bulging eyes and a manner of frightened sw~tness toward every- one. He was the relic of an ancient family, and it was suspected that Francon had taken him into partnership for the sake of his social connections. People felt sorry for poor dear Lucius, ad- 52"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"mired him for the effort of undertaking a professional career, and thought it would be nice to let him build their homes. Francon built them and required no further service from Lucius; This sat- isfied everybody. _ The men in the drafting rooms· loved Peter K~ating. He made them feel as if he had been there for a long time; he had always known how to become part of any place he entered; he·oame·soft ana bright as. a sponge to be fdled, unresisting, with the air and the mood of the place. ~ warm smile, hi~ gay voice, the easy shrug _of hiS shoulders seemed to say that nothing weighed_ too much within his soul and so he was not one to blame, to dellilllld; to accuse anything. _ . . · _ · As he sat now; watching Francon read the article; Francon raised his head to glance at him. Francon saw two eyes loo.ldng at him with immense approval-and two bright little points of contempt in the comers of Keating's mouth, like two musical notes of laughter visible the second before they were to be heard. Francon 'felt a great wave of comfort. The comfort ~e from the contempt. The approval;- together. with that wise half-smile,_ granted him a grandeur he did not have to ~; a blind admira- tion would ·have been precarious; a deserved ·admiration•would have been a responsibility; an undeserved admiration-was pre- cious. · · ''When you go, Peter; give this to Miss Jeffers to- put in my scrapbook.\" · On his way down the stairs, Keating flung the magazine high in the air and caught it sinartly, -his lips· pursed tp whistle without sound. · - - · · · - · ··. In the drafting room be found Tim Davis, ·his best friend.- slouched despondently over a drawing. Tim Davis was the tall, blond boy at ·the next table; whom Keating ba\"d noticed long ago, because he had known, with no tangible ·evidence, bot with · certainty; as Keating always knew· such things, that this was tbe favored draftsman of· the office.

Soon they were going out to ·lunch to- gether, and to a quiet little speak-easy after the day's work, and Keating- was listening with breathless attention to Davis' talk .. _ about his love for one Elaine Duffy, not a word of which Keating. ever remembered afterward. He found· Davis now in black gloom; his mouth chewing furi- ously a cigarette and a pencil at once. Keating did not have to question him. He merely bent his friendly ·face over Davis' shoulder. Davis spit out the cigarette and exploded. He had just been told that be would have to . work overtime tonight, for the third time this week. \"Got to stay late, God knows bow late!

She won't believe me! She told me so las.t time! That's the end! I'm going up to Guy the Mighty and tell him where he can put his plans and his job! l\"m through!\" \"Wait,\" said Keating, and leaned closer to him. \"Wait! There's another way.

You're too new for this kind of job.\" ''They won't find out\" · \"I can't lose my job, Pete. You know I can't Elaine and I are going. to be. married soon. If anything happens ... \" \"Nothing will happen.\" Shortly after six, Davis departed furtively from the empty drafting room, leaving Keating at his table . . Bending under-a solitary green lamp. Keating glanced at the desolate expllilSe of three long rooms~ oddly silent after the day's rush, and he felt that he owned them, that he would own them, as surely as the pencil mo;ved in .his hand. It was h8lf past nine when be finished the plans, stacked them neatly on Davis' table, and left the office. He walked down the street, glowing with a comfortable; undignified feeling, as though after a good meal. Then the realization of his loneliness struck him suddenly. He ·bad to. share this with someone tonight. He had no one. For·the first. time. he wished his mother. were in New York. But she had remained in Stali.ton,. awaiting the day when h~;~ would be able to send for her. He had nowhere to go tonight, save to the respectable little.: boardinghouse ·on West Twenty- Eighth Street, where he could.cliJnb three· flightS ()f stairs to his clean, airless little room: He had met people in' New York, many people,. many girls, with one of whom he remembered spending a pleasant night, though he could not remember herJ.ast name; but be wished to see none of them. And theh he .thought of Cath- erine Halsey. · He had sent her a wire. on the nightof his graduation and for- gotten her ever since. Now he wanted to see her; the desire was intense and immediate with the first ·sound of her name in his memory. He leaped into a bus for the long ride to Greenwich Vtl- 54"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"lage, climbed to the deserted top and, sitting alone on the front bench, cursed the traffic lights whenever they turned to red. It had always been like this where Catherine was concerned; and he wondered dimly what was the matter with him. He had met her a year ago in Boston, where she had lived with her widowed mother. He had found Catherine homely and dull, on that first meeting, with nothing to her credit but her lovely smile, not a sufficient reason ever to see her again. He had tele- phoned her the next evening. Of the countless girls he had known in his stUdent years she was the only one with whom he had never progressed beyond a few kisses. He could have any girl he met and he knew it; he knew that he could have Catherine; he wanted her; she loved him and had admitted it simply, openly, without fear or shyness, asking nothing of him, expecting noth- ing; somehow, he had never taken advantage of it. fie had felt proud of the girls whom he escorted in those days, the lll()st beautiful girls, the most ·popular, the_ best dressed, and he had de- lighted in the envy of his schoolmates. He had been ashamed of Catherine's thoughtless sloppiness and of the fact that no- other boy would look at her twice. But he had never _been as happy as when he took her to fraternity dances. He had had many violent loves, when he swore be could not live without this girl or that; he forgot Catherine for weeks at a time and she never reminded him. He had always come back to her, suddenly,. inexplicably, as be did tonight. . . Her mother, a gentle little schoolteacher, had died last winter. Catherine had gone to live with an uncle in New York. Keating bad answered some of her letters immediately, others-months later. She had always replied at once, and never written during his long silences, waiting patiently: He had felt, when he thought of her, that nothing would ever replace her. Then, in New York, within reach of a bus or a telephone, he bad forgotten h~r again for a month. He never. thought, as he hurried to her now, that he should have announced his visit. He never wondered whether he would find her at home. He had always come back like this and she had always been there. She was there again tonight. She opened the door for him, on the top floor of a shabby, pre- tentious brownstone house. \"Hello, Peter,\" she said, as if she had seen him yesterday. She stood before him, too small, too thin for her. clothes. The short black skirt flared out from the slim band of her waist; the boy- ish shirt collar hung loosely, pulled to one side, revealing the knob of a thin collarbone; the sleeves were too long over the -fragile hands. She looked at him, her head bent to one side; bet chestnut hair was gathered carelessly at the back of her neck, but it looked as though it. were bobbed, standing; light and fuzzy, as a shapeless 55 .."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"halo about her face. Her eyes were gray, wide and nearsighted; her mouth smiled slowly, delicately, enchantingly, her lips glistening. \"Hello, Katie,\" he said. He felt at peace. He felt he had nothing to fear, in this house or anywhere outside. He had prepared himself to explain how busy he'd been in New York; but explanations seemed irrelevant now. · ' \"Give me your hat,\" she said, \"be careful of that chair, it's not very steady, we have better ones in the living room, come in.\" The liVing room, he noticed, was modest but somehow distin- guished, and in surprisingly good taste. He noticed the books; cheap shelves rising to the ceiling, loaded with precious volumes; the volumes stacked carelessly, actually being used. He noticed, over a neat, shabby desk, a Rembrandt etching, stained and yel- low, found, perhaps, in some junk shop by the eyes of a connois- seur who had never parted with it, though its price would have obviously been of help to him. He wondered what business her uncle could be in; he had never asked. · · He. stood l()()king vaguely at the room, feeling her presence be- hind him, enjoying that sense of certainty which he found so rarely. Then he turned and took her in his arms and kissed her; her lips met his softly, eagerly; but she was neither frightened nor excited, too happy to accept this in any way save by taking it for granted. ''God, I've missed you!\" he said, and knew that he had, every day since he'd seen her last and most of all, perhaps. on the days when he had not thought of her. \"You haven't changed much,\" she said. ''You look a little thin- ner. It's becoming. You'll be very attractive when you're fifty, Peter.\" ''That's not very complimentary-by implication.\" . \"Why? Oh, you mean I think you're not attractive now? Oh, but you are.\" \"You shouldn't say that right out to me like that.\" . \"Why not? You know you are. But I've been thinking of what you'll look like at fifty. You'll have gray temples and you'll wear a gray suit-I saw one in a window last week and I thought that would be the one-and you'll be a very great architect.\" \"You really think so?\" . \"Why, yes.\" She was not flattering him. She did not seem'to realize that it could be flattery. She was merely stating a fact, too certain to need emphasis. He waited for the inevitable questions. But instead, they were talking suddenly of their old Stanton days together, and he was laughing, holding her across his knees, her thin shoulders leaning against the circle of his arm, her eyes soft, contented. He was speaking of their old bathing suits, of the runs in her stockings, of their favorite ice-cream parlor in Stanton, where they had 56"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"spent so many summer evenings together-and he was thinking dimly that it made no sense at all: he had more pertinent things to tell and to ask her; people did not talk like that when they hadn't seen each other for months. But it seemed quite normal to her; she did not appear to know that they had been parted. He was first to ask finally: \"Did you get my wire?\" \"Oh, yes. Thanks.\" \"Don't you want to know how I'm getting along in the city?\" \"Sure. How are you getting aiong in the city?'' \"Look here, you're not terribly interested.\" ''Oh, but I am! I want to know everything about you.\" ''Why don't you ask?'' · \"You'll tell me when you. want to.\" ''It doesn't matter much to you, does it?'' ''What?'' . ''What I've been doing.\" \"Oh ...

After work he walked the long distance to his home, a tene- ment near the East River. He had chosen that tenement because he had been able to get, for two-fifty a week, its entire top floor, a huge room that had been used for storage: it had no ceiling and the roof leaked between its naked beams. But it had a long row of windows, along two of its walls, some panes filled with glass, others with cardboard, and the windows opened high over the river on one side and the City on the other. A week ago Cameron had come into the drafting room and had thrown down on Roark's table a violent sketch of a country residence. \"See if you can make a house out of this!\" he had snapped and gone without further explanation. He had not ap- proached Roark's table during the days that followed. Roark had finished the drawings last night and left them on Cameron's desk. This morning, Cameron had come in, thrown some sketches of steel joints to Roark, ordered him to appear in his office later and had not entered the drafting room again for the rest of the day. The others were gone. Roark pulled an old piece ·of oilcloth over his table and went to Cameron's office. His drawings of the country house were spread on the desk. The light of the lamp fell on Cameron's cheek, on his beard, the white threads glistening, on his fist, on a comer of the drawing, its black lines bright and hard as if embossed on the paper. \"You're fired,\" said-Cameron. Roark stood, halfway acn)ss the long room, his weight on one le~, his arms hanging by his sides, one shoulder raised. \"Am I?\" he asked quietly, without moving. \"Come here,\" said Cameron. \"Sit down.\" Roark obeyed. . \"You're too good,\" said Cameron. \"You're too good for what you want to do with yourself. It's no use, Roark. Better now than later.\" ''What do you mean?'' \"It's no use wasting what you've got on an ideal that you'll never reach, that they'll never let you reach.

You've got what they'll pay you for, and pay plenty, if you use it their way. Accept them, Roark. Compromise. Compromise now,- because you'll have to later, anyway, only then you'll have gone through things you'll wish you hadn't. You don't know. I do. Save yourself from that. Leave me.

Still only a draftsman, he was Francon's reigning favorite. Francon took him out to lunch-an unprecedented honor for an employee. Fnuicon called him to be present at interviews with .clients. The clients seemed ta like seeing so decorative a young man in an architect's office. Lucius N. Heyer had the annoying habit of asking francon suddehly: \"When did you get the new man?'' and pointiiig to an employee who had been there for three years. But Heyer sur- prised everybody by remembering Keating's name and by greet- ing him, whenever they met, with a smile of positive recognition. Ke\"-ting had had a long conversation with him, ono dreary No- vember lj.ftemoon, on the subject of old porcelain. It was Heyer's hobby; he owned a famous collection, passionately gathered. Keating displayed an earnest knowledge of the subject, though he had never heard of old· porcelain till the night before, which he . had spent at the public library; Heyer was delighted; nobody in the office cared about his hobbx,; few ever notiCed his presence. Heyer remarked to his partner: 'You're certainly goOd at picking your men, Guy. There's one boy I wish we wouldn't lose, what's his name?-Keating.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" Fran.con answered, smiling, \"yes, indeed.\" · . · · In the drafting room, Keating concentrated on 11m Davis. Work and drawings were only unavoidable details on the surface of his days; .Tim Davis .was the substimee and the shape of the first step in his career. · · · Davis let him do most of his own work; only night work, Ill - ft(St, then parts of his daily assignments as well; secretly, at fust, then opeDJ.y. Davis had not wanted it to be known. Keating made it known, with .an air of naive confidence which implied that he was only a tool, no more than Tim's pencil or T-square, that his help enhanced Tim's importance rather than diminished it and, therefore;. he did not wish to conceal it. . At fust, Davis relayed instructions to Keating; then the chief draftsman took the arrangement for granted and began comi.Jig to Keating with orders intended for Davis. Keating was always there, smiling; saying: \"I'll do it; don't bother Tim with those Iit- 66"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"tle things, I'll take care of it.\" Davis relaxed and let himself be carried along; he smoked a great deal, he lolled about, his legs twisted loosely over the rungs of a stool, his eyes closed, dream- ing of Elaine; he uttered once in a while' \"Is the stuff ready, . Pete?\" Davishad married Elaine that spring. He was frequently. late for work. He had whispered to Keating: ~·You're in with the old man, Pete, slip a good word for me, once in a while, will you?-so they'll overlook a few things. God, do I hate to have to be working right now!\" Keating would say to Fnmcon: \"I'm sorry, Mr. Francon, that the Murray job sub-basement plans were so late, but Tim Davis had a quarrel with his wife last njght, and you know how newlyweds are, you don't want to be too hard on them,\" or \"It's Tim Davis again, Mr. Francon, do forgive him,.be can't help it, he hasn't got his mind on his work at .all!\" When Francon glanced at the list of his employees' salaries, he noticed that his most expensive draftsman was the man least needed in the office. . When Tim Davis lost his job, no one in the drafting room was surprised but Tim Davis. He could not understand it. He. set his lips defiantly in bitterness against a world he would hate ·forever. He felt he had no friend on earth save Peter Keating. Keating consoled him, cursed Francon, cursed the injustice of humanity, spent six dollars in a speak-easy, entertaining the sec- retary of an obscure architect of his acquaintance and arranged a new job for Tim Davis. · · Whenever he thought of Davis afterward, Keating felt a warm pleasure; he had influenced the course of a human being, had thro\\Yfi him off one path and pushed him into another; a human being-it. was· not Tun Davis to him any longer, it was· a living frame and a mind, a conscious mind-why had he always feared that mysterious entity of consciou.sness. within others?-aBd he had twisted that frame and that mind to his own will. By a unan- imous decision ofFrancon, Heyer and.the chief draftsman, Tim's table,. position and salary were given:. to Peter Keating. But this was only part of his satisfaction; there was another sense of it, warmer and less real-and. more dangerous: He said brightly and often: \"Tun Davis? Oh yes, I got him his present job.\" He wrote to his mother about it. She said to her friends: \"Petey is such an unselfish boy.'' · .. He wrote to ll.er dutifully each week; his letters were short and respect:fiil; hers, long, detailed and full of advice which he sel- dom finished reading. He. saw Catherine Halsey occasionally. He had not gone to her on that fallowing evening, as he had promised. He had awakened in the morning and remembered the things he had said to her, and hated her for his .having .said them. But he had gone to her again, a week later;. she had not reproached him and they had not 67 ---------::.:.."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"mentioned her uncle. He saw ber after that every. month or two; be was happy when be saw· her,· but be never spoke to her of his career. He tried to speak of it to Howard Roark; the attempt failed.

He gr!leted Roark eagerly; he waited for . reassmanee, not knowing what sort of reassurance be needed nor why it could come only frolll Roark. He spoke of his job and be questioned Roark, with sincere concern, about Cameron's office. Roark listened to him, answered all his questions willingly, but Keating felf that he was knocking against a sheet of iron in RoiU'k:'s linmoving eyes, and that they were not speaking ·about the saine things at all. Before the visit was over, Keating was tak- ing notice of Roark's frayed cuffs, of his shoes, of_the patch on the knee of his· trousers, and he felt satisfied. He went away chuckling, but he went away miserably uneasy, and wondered why, and swore never to see Roark again, and wondered why be kneYI that he would have to see him. \"Well,'' said K~g>.

Through the open door of the bathroom he saw Francoli stand- ing at the washstand, his stomach pressed to its shining edge, brushing his teeth. - \"That's splendid,'' said Fnincon, munching through a thick foam of toothpaste. ''That'll do just as well. Don't you seeT' \"No.\" \"Lord, Pete, I explained it to you yesterday before we started. Mrs. Dunlop's husband's planning to build a home for her.\" . \"Oh, yeah,\" -said Keating weakly, brushing the matted black curls off bis face. ''Oh, yeah.~ ..

You're to see where that commission ends up, Pete. Can I count on you, Pete?'' \"Sure,\" said Keating, his head drooping. \"You can always count on me, Guy .... \" He sat still, watching his bare toes and thinking of Stengel, Francon's designer. He did not want to think, but his mind leaped to Stengel automatically, as it always did, because Stengel repre- sented his next step. Stengel was impregnable to friendship. For two years, Keating's attempts had broken against the ice of Stengel's glasses. What Stengel thought of him was whispered in the draft- ing rooms, but few.dared to repeat-it save in quotes; Stengel.said it aloud, even though he knew that the corrections his sketclles bore, when they returned to him from ·Francon's office, were made by Keating's hand. But Stengel had a vulnerable point: he had been planning for some time to leave Francon and open an office of his ~wn. He had selected a partner, a young architect of no talent but of great inherited wealth,-Stengel was Waiting only for a chance. Keating- had thought about this a great deal. He could think of nothing else. He thought of it again,' si~g there on the floor of Francon's bedroom. · TWo days later; when he escorted Mrs. Punlop through the gal- lery exhibiting the paintings of one Frederic Mawson, his coUI'se of action was set. He piloted her thro.ugh the sparse crowd; his fingers closing over her elbow once in a while, letting her, catch his eyes directed at her young face more often· than at the paint- ings. . . ·· . \"Yes,\" he said as she stared obediently at a landscape featuring an auto dump and tried to compose her face into the look of ad- miration expected of her;. ''magnificent_ work. Note the colors, Mrs. Dunlop .... They say this fellow Mawsop had a ~bly hard time. It's an old story-trying to get recognition. :Old and heartbreaking. It's the same in ail the arts. My own profession in- cluded.\" · · _\"Oh, indeed?'' said Mrs. Dunlop, who quite seemed to i>refer architecture at the moment. , ''Now this,'' said Keating, stopping ~fore the depiction of an · old hag picking at her bare toes on a street curb, \"this is art as a social document. It takes a person of courage to appreciate this.\" - · · ''It's simply wonderful,\" said Mrs. Dunlop. . , \"Ah, yes, courage. It's a rare quality. . . .

Then be jerked his head and snapped: \"What's in it for you?'' Before -Keating could answer, Stengel threw his head back suddenly. . \"''Ob/' said Stengel. \"Oh, I see.~· Then he leaned forward, his mouth drawn thin in contempt: \"Okay. I'll go to that lunch.\" When Stengel left the finn of Francon & Heyer to open his own office and proceed with the construction of the Dunlop house, his first commission, Guy Francon smashed a. ruler against the edge of his desk and roared to Keating: . \"The bastard! The ·abysmal bastard! After all I've done for hi \" . m • . ''What did you expect?'' said Keating, sprawled in a low arm- cbair'befote him. \"Such is life.'' - ''But what beats me is bow did that little skunk ever hear of it? To snatch it right .from under our nose!\" · \"Well, I've never trusted him anyway.\" Keating shrugged . .. Human nature .. .''.: . · . . The bitter.ness in his voice was sincere. He had received no gratitude from. Stengel. Stengel's parting remarJc. to bim had been only; \"You're; a worse bastard than I thought you were. Good luck. You~.ll be ·a great architect some .day.\" Thus Keating achieved the position of chief designer for Francon .& Heyer. _ · Francon celebrated -the occasion with a modest little orgy at one of the· quieter and costlier restaurants. \"In. a coupla years,\" be kept repeating, '';in a, coupla years you'll see things bappenin', Pete ....

It was a triumphant feeling. It was a tangible affirmation of his· greatness. Then be found himself _suddenly in his gb1ss-enclosed office, looking down at a blank sheet of paper-alone. Something rolled in. his throat down to his stomach, cold and empty, his old feeling of the .dropping hole. He leaned against the table, closing his eyes. It had never been quite real to him before that this was the thing actually expected of him:-to fill a sheet of paper, to ~te some- thing on a-sheet of paper •. 71"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"It was only a small residence. But instead of seeing it rise be- fore him, he saw it sinking; he saw its shape as a pit in the ground; and as a pit within him; as emptiness,, with only Davis and Stengel rattling uselessly within it. Francon had said to him about the building: \"It must have dignity, you know, dignity ... nothing freaky :. : a structure of elegance ... and stay within the budget,\" which was Francon's conception of giving his designer ideas and letting him work them out. Through a cold stupor, Keating thought of the clients laughing in his face; he heard the thin, omnipotent voice of Ellsworth Toohey calling his attention to the opportunities open to him in the field of plumbing. He hated every piece of stone on the face of the earth. He hated him- self for having chosen to be an architect. When he began to draw, he tried not to think of the job he was doing; he thought only that Francon had done it, and Stengel, . even Heyer, and all the others, and that he could do it, if they could. He spent many days on his prel.iniinary sketches. He spent long hours in the library of Francon & Heyer, selecting from Classic photographs the appearance of his house. He felt the ten- sion melting in his mind. It was right and it wa8 good, that bouse growing under his hand, because men were still worshiping the masters who had done it before him. He did not have to wonder, to fear or to take chances; it had been done for him. When the.drawings were ready, he stood looking at them :un- certainly. Were he to be told that this was the best or the ugliest house in the world, he would agree with either. He was not sure. He had to be sure. He thought of Stanton and of what be had re- lied upon when working on his assignments there. He telephoned Cameron's office and asked for Howard Roark. He came to Roark's room. that night, and spread before him the plans, the elevations, the perspective of his first building. Roark stood over it, his arms spread wide, his hands holding.the edge of the table, and he said nothing for a long time. . · Keapng waited anxiously; he felt anger growing with his anxiety-because he could see no· reason for being so anxious. When he couldn't stand it, he spoke:· \"You know, Howard, everybody says Stengel's the best de- signer in town, and I don'ttbink he was really ready to quit, but I made him and I took his place. I had to do some pretty fine thinking to work that, I ... \" . He stopped. It did not sound bright and proud, as it would have sounded anywhere else. It sounded like begging .. Roark turned and looked at him. Roark's eyes were not con- temptuous; only a little wider than usual, attentive and puzzled. He said nothing and turned· back to the drawings. . · Keating felt naked. Davis, Stengel, Francon meant nothing here. People were his protection against people. Roark had no 72"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"sense of people. Others gave Keating a feeling of his own value. Roark gave him nothing. He 1hought that he should seize his drawings and run. The danger was not Roark. The danger was that he, Keating, remained. Roark turned to him. \"Do you enjoy doing this sort of thing, Peter?\" he asked. ''Oh, I know,\" said Keating, his voice shrill, \"I know you don't approve of it, but this is business, I just want to know what you think.of this practically,. not philosophically, not ... \" ''No, I'm not going to preach to you.

He picked up . the plans. He took a sheet of tracing paper; threw it over the plan and began to. draw. Keating stood watching the pencij.. in Roark's hand.

What an imagination you have, Peter ... I wonder ...

And Keating thought suddenly that Francon did not really believe it and knew that Keating did not believe it, and yet they were both contented, bound tighter together by a common method and a common guilt.

A check was attached to the letter, in payment for his preliminary drawings, as agreed; the amount was not enough to cover the expense of making those drawings. The letter lay spread out on the desk.

He · and Roark bad worked savagely-to have the plans ready on time, before time, before Gould & Pettingill could submit theirs. Pettingill was a cousin of the Bank president's wife and a famous authority on the ruins of Pompeii; the Bank president was an ardent admirer of Julius Cae- sar and had once, while i~ Rome, spent an hour and a quarter in reverent inspection of the Colosseum. Cameron and Roark and a pot of black coffee bad lived in the office from dawn till frozen dawn for..Jllany days, and Cameron had thought involuntarily of the electric bill, but made himself forget it. The lights still bunied in the drafting room in the early hours when he sent Roark out for sandwiches, and Roark found gray morning in the streets while it was still night in the office, in the windows facing a high brick wall. On the last day, it was Roark who had ordered Cameron home after midnight, because Cameron's hands were jerking and his knees kept seeking the tall drafting stool for support, leaning against it with a slow, cautious, sickening precision. Roark had taken him down to a taxi and in the light of a street lamp Cameron had seenRoark's face, drawn, the eyes kept wide artificially, the lips dry.

Toohey was- published iQ. January of the year 1925. . · It had a fastidious jacket of midnight blue with plain silver let- . ters and a silver pyramid in one comer. It was subtitled \"Archi- tecture for Everybody\" and its success was sensa:jional. It presented. the entire history of architecture, from mud hut tO sky- scraper, in the terms of the man in the street, but it made these terms appear st;ientific. Its author stated in his preface that it was an attempt ''to bring architecture where it belongs-'-to ·the peo..· pie.\" He stated further that he wished to see the average man ''think and speak of architecture as he speaks of baseba:Il.\" He did not bOre his readers with the technic3Iities of the Five Orders, the pcist and lintel, the flying buttress or reinforced conC:rete~ He filled his pages with homey ·accounts of the daily life of tile Egyptian housekeeper, the Roman shoe--cobbler;. the. mistress of Louis XIY, what they ate, how they washed, where they shopped and what effeet their buildings had upon their existence. But he gave his readers the impression that they · vere learning all they had to know about the Five Orders and the reinforced concrete. He gave. his readers the impression· that there were no problems, no achieve.ments, no ·reaches of thought beyond the common daily routine of people nameless in the past as they were in the present; that science had no goal and no expression beyond its influence on this routine; that merely by living through their own obscure days his readers were rel?resenting an(,l achieving all the highest objectives of any civilization. His scientific precision w~ impeccable and his erudition astounding; no one could refute him on the cooking utensils of Babylon. or the doormats of Byzantium. He wrote with the flash and the color of a first-hand observer. He did not plod .laboriously through the centuries; he danced, said the critics, down the road of the ages, as a jester; a friend and a prophet. He said that architecture was truly the greatest of the arts, be- cause it was anonymous, as all greatness. He said that the world had many famous buildings, but few renowned builders, which was as it should be, since no one man had ever created anything of importance in architecture, or elsewhere, for that matter. The 77"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"few whose names had lived were really impPstors, expropriating the glory of the people as others expropriated its wealth. \"When we gaze at the magnificence of an ancient monument and ascribe its achieveme~t to one man, we are guilty of spiritual embezzle- ment. We forget the army of craftsmen, unknown and unsung, who preceded him in the darkness of the ages, who. toiled humbly-an· heroism is humble-each contributing his small share to the common treasure of his time. A great building is not the private invention of some genius or other. It is merely a con- densation of the spirit of a people.\" He. explained that the decadence of architecture had come when. private property replaced the communal spirit of the Mid~ die Ages, and that the selfishness of individual owners-who · built for ·no purpose save to satisfy their own bad taste, \"all_ claim to an individual taste is bad taste\"-had ruined the planned effect of cities. He demonstrated that there was no such thing as free will, since men's creative impulses were determined, as all else, by the economic structure of the epoch in which they lived. He expressed admiration for all the. great historical styles, but ad- monished against their wanton mixture. He dismissed modem ar- chitecture, stating that: \"So far, ·it has represented nothing but the whim of isolated im:lividuals, has borne no relation to any great, spontaneous ma8s movement, and as such is of no consequence.\" He predicted a better world to come, where all men would be brothers and their buildings would become harmonious and all alike, in the great tradition of Greece, \"the Mother of Democ- racy.\" When he wrote this, he managed to convey-:-with no tan- gible break in the detached· c_alm of his style-that the words now seen in ordered print bad been blurred in manuscript by a hand unsteady· with emotion. He called upon architects to aban- don their selfish quest for individual glory and dedicate them- selves to the embodiment of tbe mood of their people. \"Architects are servants, not leaders. They are not to assert their little- egos, but to express the soul of their country and the rhythm of their time. They are not to follow the delusions of their per- · sonal fancy, but to seek the common denominator, which will bring their work close to the heart of the -masses. Architects-ab, my friends; theirs is not to. reason why. _Theirs is not to com- mand, but to be commande<t.\" The advertisements for Sermons in Stone carried quotations from critics: \"Magnificent!\" \"A stupendous achievement!\" '.'Un- · equaled in all art history!\" \"Your chance to get acquainted with a charming man and a profound thinker.\" \"Mandatory reading for anyone aspiring to the title of intellectual.\" . There seemed to be a great many aspiring to that title. Readers acquired erudition without study, authority without cost, judg- ment without effort. It was pleasant to look .at buildings and crit- icize them with a professional manner and with the memory of 78"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"page 439; to hold artistic discussions and exchange the same sen- tences from the same paragraphs.

Then, one day in February, when Cameron had touched no. al- . cobol for weeks, he reached for· a book on a shelf and collapsed at Roark's feet, suddenly, simply, finally. Roark took IUlii home and the doctor staled that .an attempt to leave. his bed would be all the ~th sentence Cameron needed.

Tlum he said: · . \"You'll close the office for me, Howard, will you?'' ''Yes,\" ~d Roark. . · . Ciuneron closed his eyes, and would say nothing else, and Roark sat all night by his bed, not knowing whether the old man slept or not. . A sister of Cameron's appeared from somewhere in New Jer- sey. She . was a meek little old lady with· white hair, trembling hands and a face one could never .remembe.r, quic:t, resigned and gently hopeless. She had a meager little in!,:O!Jle and she assumed the responsibility of taking her brother to her home in New Jer~ sey; she had never been married and had no one else· in the · world; she was neither glad nor sorry of the burden; she had lost all capacity for emotion many years ago. . · 79"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"On the day of his departure Cameron handed to Roark a letter he had written in the night, written painfully, an old drawing board on his knees, a pillow propping his back. The letter was addressed to a prominent architect; it was Roark's introduction to a job. Roark read it and, looking at Cameron, not at his OVI(n hands, tore the letter· across, folded the pieces and tore it again. \"No,\" said Roark. \"You're not going to ask them for anything. Don't worry about me.\" Cameron nodded and kept silent for a long time. · Then he said: . \"You'll close up the office, Howard. You'll let them keep the furniture for their rent. But you'll take the drawing that's on the wall in my room there and you'll ship it to me. Only that. You'll bum everything else. All .the papers, the files, the drawings, the contracts, everything.\" \"Yes,\" said Roark. . Miss Cameron came with the orderlies and the stretcher, and they rode in an ambulance to the ferry. At the entrance to the ferry, Cameron said to Roark: \"You're going back now.\" He added: \"You'll come to see me, Howard .... Not too often •.. \" . Roark turned and walked away, while they were carrying Cameron to the pier. It was a gray morning and there was the cold, rotting smell of the sea in the air. A gull dipped low over the street, gray like a floating piece of newspaper, against a· cor- ner of damp, streaked stone. . That evening, Roark went to Cameron's closed office. He did not tum on the lights. He made a fire in the Franklin heater in Cameron's room, and emptied drawer after drawer into the fire, not looking down at them.- The papers rustled dryly in the si- lence, a thin odor of mold rose through the dark room, and the frre hissed, crackling, leaping in bright streaks. At times a white .,... flake with charred edges would flutter out of the flames. He pushed it back with the end of a steel ruler. There were drawings of Cameron's famous buildings and of buildings unbuilt; there were blueprints with the thin white lines tl)at were girders still standing somewhere; there were contracts with famous signatures; and at times, from out of the red glow, there flashed a sum of seven figures written on yellowed paper, flashed and went down, in a thin burst of sparks. From among the letters m an old folder, a newspaper clipping fluttered to the floor. Roark picked it up. It was dry, brittle and yellow, and it broke at the folds, in his fingers. It was an inter- view given by Henry Cameron, dated May 7, 1892. It said: \"Ar- chitecture is not a business, not a career, but .a crusade and a consecration to a joy that justifies the existence of the earth.\" He dropped the clipping ipto the fire and reached for another folder. 80"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"He gathered every stub of pencil from Cameron's desk. and threw them in also. _ He stood. over the heater.

He carried_ his head high, his body erect with stUdied up- rightness; he looked like the picture of a successful young mari in advertisements for high-priced razors or medium-priced cars.

He had learned to accept his new job. The lines he drew were to be the clean lines of steel beams, -and be tried not to think of what these beams would carry. It wa8 difficult; at times. Between him and-the plan of the building on which he was working stood the plan of that building as it should have been.

He had to obey and draw the lines as instructed. It hurt hiin so much that he shrugged at himself in cold anger. He thought: difficult?-well, learn· it. But the pain remained-1llld a helpless wonder. The thing he saw was so much more real than the reality of paper, office and commission. He could not understand what made others blind to it, and what made their indifference possible. He looked at the paper before him.- He wondered ·why ineptitude should exist and have its say. He had-never known that. And the reality which per- mitted it could never become quite real to him.

Then he worked for hours, sometimes all night, while Keating saf and watched. He forgot Keating's presence. He saw only a building and his chance to shape it.

Roark walked through the shell of what was to be a gigantic apartment hotel, and stopped · before an electrician at work. The man was toiling assiduously, bending conduits around a beam. It was a task for hours of strain and patience, in a ·space overfilled against all calculations. Roark stood;- his hands in his pockets, watching the man's slow, painful progress.

The man stood wa,tching billl. Roiut's arm w~ steady, holding the tense, hissing streak of flame in leash, shuddering faintly with its violence, but holding it aimed straight. There was no strain, no eff~ in the easyposture of his body, only in his arm. And it 'seemed as if the blue tension eating slowly through metal came not from the flame but from the haild holding it. He finished, put the torch down, and rose. \"Jesus!!' 'iaid the' electrician. \"Do you know how to handle a -torch!\" · \"Looks like it, doesn't it'?'' He removed the gloves, the gog- gles, and hailded them back. \"DO it that way from now on. Tell the foreman I said so.\" The electrician was staring reverently at the . neat hole cut through the beam. He muttered: \"Where did you learn to haildle it like that, Red?'' · · Roarlc's slow, amused smile acknowledged this concession of victory. \"Oh, I've been an electrician, and a plumber, and a rivet catcher, and many other things;\" \"And went to school besides?'' 92"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"\"Well, in a way.\" \"Gonna be an architect?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, you'll be the first one that knows something besides pretty pictures and tea parties.

So long.\" \"So long, Red.\" The next time Roark appeared on that job, the blue-eyed elec- trician waved to him from afar, and called him over, and asked advice about his wc;>rk which he did not need; he stated that his name was Mike and that he had missed Roark for several days. On the next visit the day shift was just leaving, and Mike waited outside for Roark to finish the inspection. \"How about a glass of beer, Red?\" he invited, when Roark came out. \"Sure,\" said Roark, ''thanks.\" They sat together af a table in the comer of a basement speak- easy, and they drank beer, and Mike related his favorite tale of how he had fallen five stories when a scaffolding gave way. under him, how he had 'broken three ribs but lived to tell it, and Roark spoke of his days in the building trades .. Mike did' have a re~ name, which was Sean Xavier Donnigan, but everyone:had for- gotten it long ago; he owned a set of tools and ail ancient Ford, and existed for the sole purpose of traveling around the country from one big construction job to another. People meant very little .to Mike, but their performance a great deal. He worshiped ex- pertness of any kind. He·Joved his work passionately and had no tolerance for anything save for other single-track devotions. He was a master in his own field and· he felt no sympathy except for mastery. His view of the world was simple: there were the able and there were the incompetent; he was not concerned with the latter. He loved buiJdings. He despised, howev~r. all architects. ''There was one, Red,\" he said earnestly, over his fifth beer, \"one only and you'd be too young to know about him, but that was the only man that knew building. I worked for him when I was your age.\" \"Who was that?\" \"Henry Cameron was his name. He's dead, I guess; these many years.\" . . · Roark looked at him for a long time, then said: \"He's not dead, Mike,\" and added: ''I've worked for him.\" \"You did?\" ' \"For almost three years.\" They looked at each .other silently, and that was the final seal on their friendship.

Mike looked at him, shrugged and griniled. \"No,\" said Mike. 8 EARLY IN May,- Peter Keating departed ·for Washington, to super- . vise the construction of a museum donated· to the city by a great · philanthropist easing his. conscience. The museum building; Keating pointed out proudly, was to be decidedly different: it was not a 'reproduction of the Parthenon, but of the Maison Carree at Nimes. · Keating had been away for some time when an office boy ap- proached Roark's table and informed him that Mr. Francon wished to see him in his office. When Roark entered the sanctu- ary, Francon _smiled from behind the desk and said cheed'ully: \"Sit do1ND, my friend. Sit down •••• \" but something in Roark's eyes; which he had never .seen at close range before, made Francon's voice shrink and· stop, and he added dryly: \"Sit down.\" Roark obeyed. Francon studied him· for a second, but could reach no conclusion beyond deciding that !he man had a most unpleasant face; yet ·looked quite correctly attentive. · _ \"You're the one who's worked for Cameron, aren't you?\" Francon asked. \"Yes,\" said Roark. \"Mr. Keating.has been telling me very nice things about you,\" Fralicoil tried pleasantly and stopped. It was wasted courteliy; Roark just sat looking at him, waiting. : · \"Usten •.. what's yoilr name?'' ''Roari.C.\" ''Listen, Roark. We have a client who is a little ... odd, but he's an important man, a very ~portant man, and ~ve to sat- isfy him.

It was a photograph of.the Dana Building. - Roark sat quite still, -the photograph hanging between his fin- gers._ · \"Do you know that building?'' asked Francon. 94"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"\"Yes.\" ''Well, that's what he wantS. And Mr. Keating's away. I've had Bennett and Cooper and Williams make sketches, but he's turned them down. So I thought I'd give you a chance.\" Francon looked at him, impressed by the magnanimity of his own offer. There was no reaction. There was only a man who still looked as if he'd been struck on the head. \"Of course,\" said Francon, \"it's quite a jump for you, quite an assignment, but I thought I'd let you try. Don't-be afraid. Mr. Keating and I· will go over it afterward. Just draw up the plans and a good sketch of it. You must have an idea of what the man wants. You know Cameron's tricks. But of course, we can't let a crude thing like this come out of our office. We must please him, . but we must also preserve our reputation and not frighten all our other clients away. The point is to make it simple and in the gen- eral mood of this, but also artistic. You know, the more severe kind of Greek. You don't have to use the Ionic. order, use the Doric.

Th cheat him and to give him the same old trash, when you have so many others asking for it, and. one, only o~e. who comes with a request like this?'' . \"Aren't you forgetting yourself?\" asked Francon, coldly. \"What· difference would it make to you? Just let me do it my way and show it to him. Only show it to him. He's already turned down three sketches, what if he turns down a fourth? But if he doesn't ... if he doesn't ... \" Roark had never known how to entreat and he was not doing 95"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"it well; his voice was hard, toneless, revealing the effort, so that the plea became an insult to the man who was making him plead. Keating would have given a great deal· to see Roark in that mo- ment. But Francon could not appreciate the triumph he ·was the first ever to achieve; he recognized oilly the insult. · \"Am I correct in gathering,\" Francon asked, ''that you are crit- icizing me and teaching me something about architecture?\" · · ·\"I'm begging you,\" said Roark, closing his eyes. \"H you weren't a protege of Mr. Keating's, I wouldn't bother . to discuss the matter with you any further.

You will kindly take this photograph-and I do not wish any building as Cameron might/have designed it, I wish the scheme of this adapted to our site-and you will follow my instructions as to the Classic treatinent of the f~ade.\" \"I can't do it,\" said Roark, very quietly. \"What? Are you speaking to me? Are you actually saying: 'Sorry, I can't do it'?'' · \"l haven't said. 'sorry;' Mr. Francon.\" \"What did you say?'' ''That I can't do it.\" \"Why?\" \"You don't want to know why.·Don't ask me to do any design- ing. I'll do any other kind of job you wish, But hot that.

Mr. Francon?'' \"In all my· life,\" roared Francon, 1 'in all my experience, I've never seen anything like it! Are you here to tell me what you'll do 'and what you won't do? Are you bere to give me lessons and criticize. my taste and pass judgment?'' . \"I'm not criticizing anything,\" said Roark quietly. \"I'm not passing jud~nt. There are some things that I can't do. Let it go at that. ·May I leave now?'' \"You may leave this room and this firm now and from now on! You may go straigiU to the devil! Go and find yourself an- other employer! Try and find him!· Go get your check and get out!\" \"Yes, Mr. Francon.\" That evening Roark walked to· the. basement speak-easy where he could always find Mike after the day's work.

When Keating returned from Washington he went straight up to Francon's office. He h8d not stopped in the drafting room and had heard no news. Francon greeted him expansively: \"Boy, it's great to see you back! What'll you have? A whisky- and-soda or a little brandy'r' \"No, thanks. Just give me a cigarette.\" \"Here. . . . Boy, you look fine! Better than ever, How do you do it, you lucky bastard? I have so many things to tell you! How did it go down in Washington? Everything all right'r' And before Keating could answer, Francon rushed on: \"Something dreadful's happened to me. Most disappointing. Do you remember Lili Lan- dau? I thought I was all set with her, but last time I saw her, did I get the cold shoulder! Do you know who's got her? You'll be surprised. Gail Wynand, no less! The girl's flying high. You should see her pictures and her legs all over his newspapers. Will it help her show or won't it! What can I offer against that? And · do you know what he's done? Remember how she always said that nobody could give her what she wanted most-her child- hood home, the dear little Austrian village where she was .born? Well, Wynand ·bought it, long ago, the whole damn village,· and had it shipped here-every bit of it!--and had it assembled again down on the Hudson, and there it stands now, cobbles, chUICh, apple trees, pigsties and all!

So I showed him the gate .... What's the matter? What are you smiling at?'' \"Nothing. I can just see it.\" \"Now. don't you ask me to take him back!\" ''No, of course not.\" For 8everal days, Keating thought that he should call on Roark. He did not know what he would say, bu~ felt dimly that he should say something. He kept postponing it. He was gaining assurance in his work. He felt that he did not need Roark, after all. The days went by, and he did not call on Roark, and he felt relief in being free to forget him. Beyond the windows of his room Roark saw the roofs, the wa- ter tanks, the chimneys, the cars speeding far below. There was a threat in the silence of his room, in the empty days, in his hands hariging idly by his sides. And he felt another threat rising from the city' below, as if each window, each strip of pavement, had set itself closed grimly, in wordless resistance. It did not-dis- turb him. He had known and accepted it long ago. He made a list of the architects whose work he resented least, in the order of their lesser evil, and he set out upon the search for a job, coldly, systematically, without anger or hope. He never knew whether these days hurt him; he· knew only ttiat it was a thing which had to· be done. The architects he saw differed from one another. Some looked 98"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"at him across the desk, kindly and vaguely, and their manner seemed to say that it was touching, his ambition to be an archi- tect; touching and laudable and strange and attractively sad as all the delusions of youth. Some smiled at him with thin, drawn lips. and seemed to enjoy his presence in the room, because it made them conscious of their own accomplishment. Some spoke coldly, as if his ambition .were a personal insult. Some were ' brusque, and the sharpn~ss of their voices seemed to say that they needed good dJ'aftsmen, they always needed good drafts- men, but this qualification could not possibly apply to him, . and would he please refrain from being rude enough to force them to express it more plainly. . It was not malice. It was not a judgment passed upon his merit. They did not think he was worthless. They simply did not care to find out whether he was good. Sometimes, he was asked to show .his sketches; he extend,ed .them across a desk, feeling a conti:action of shame in the muscles of his hand; it was like hav- ing the clothes tom off his body, and the shame was not, that his body was exposed, but that it was exposed to indifferent eyes. Once in a while he made a trip to New Jersey, to see ·auneron. They sat together on the porch of a house on a hill,. Cameron in a wheel chair, his hands on an old blanket spread over his knees. \"How is it, Howard? J.>retty hard'?'' \"No.\" ''Want me to give you a letter to one of the bastards'?'' \"No.\" Then Cameron would not speak of it any JllOre, he .did not want to speak of it, he did not want the thought of Roark rej~ted by their city to become real. When Roark came t<,> him, Camero~ spoke of architecture with the Simple corifidence of a private pos- session. They sat together, looking at he city in the distance,. on the edge of the sky, beyond the river. The sky was growing dark and luminous as blue-green glass; the buildings looked like clouds condensed on the glass, gray-blue clouds frozen fqr an in- stant in straight angl~ and vertical shafts, with· the sunset caught . in the spires ..•. As the summer months passed, as his list was exhausted and he returned again to the places that had refused bioi once, Roark fourid that a few things were known· about him and he heard the same words-spoken bluntly or timidly lJr angrily or apologetically-\"You were kicked out of Stanton. You were kicked out of Francon's office.\" All the different voices saying it had one note in common: a note of relief in the certainty that the decision had been made for them. He sat on the window sill, in the evening, smoking, his hand spread on the pane, the city under his fingers, the glass cold against his skin. In September, he read an article entitled ''Make Way For To- morrow\" by Gordon L. Prescott; A.G.A. in the Architectural. Tribune. The article stated that the tragedy of the profession was 99"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"--- the hardships placed in the way of its talented beginners; that great gifts had been lost in the struggle, unnoticed; that architec- ture was perishing from a lack of new blood and new thought, a lack of originality, vision and courage; that the author of the ar- ticle made it his aim to search for promising beginners, to en- courage them, develop them and give . them the chance they deserved. Roark had never heard of Gordon L. Prescott, but there was a tone of honest conviction in the article. He allowed himself to start for Prescott's office with the first hint of hope. The reception room of Gordon L. Prescott's office was done in gray, black and searlet; it was correct, restrained and daring all at once. A young and very pretty secretary informed Roark that one could not see Mr. Prescott without an appointment, but that she would be very glad to make an appointment for next Wednesday at two-fifteen. On Wednesday at two-fifteen, the secretary smiled at Roark IUld asked him please to be seated for just a moment. At four forty-five he was admitted into Gordon L. Prescott's office. Gordon L. Prescott wore a brown checkered tweed jacket and a white turtle-neck sweater of angora wool. He was tall, athletic and thirty-five, but· his face combined a crisp air of sophisticated wisdom with the soft skin,. the button nose, the small, puffed mouth of a .college hero. ·His face was sun-scorched, his blond hair clipped ~rt, in a military Prussian haircut He was frankly masciJline, frankly uneoncerned about elegance and frankly con- scious of the effect. · He listened to R,oark silently, and his eyes were like. a stc;>p watch registering each separate second consumed by each sepa- rate word of Roark's. He let the first sentence go by; on the sec- . ond he interrupted to say curtly: ''Let me see your drawings,\" as if to make it clear that anything Roark might say was quite well known· to him already. . He held the drawings in his bronzed hands. Before he looked down at them, he said: \"Ah, yes, so many young ·men come to · me for advice, 5o many.\" He glanced at the first sketch, but . raised his head before· he had seen it. \"()( colll'8e, it's the combi- nation of the practical and the transcen~ntal that is so hard for beginners to grasp.\" He slipped the sketch to the bottom of the pile. \"Architecture is primarily a utilitarian conception, and the problem is to elevate the principle of pragmatism into the realm of esthetic absttaction. AU else is nonsense.'' He glanced at two sketches and slipped them to. the bottom. \"I have no patience with visionaries who see a holy crusade in architecture for archi- tecture's sake. The great dynamic principle is. the common prin- ciple of the human equation.\" He glanced at a sketch and slipped it under. ''The public taste and the public heart are the final cri- teria of the artist. The genius is the one who knows how to ex- press the general. The exception is to tap the unexceptional.\" He 100"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"weighted the pile of sketches in his hand, noted that he had gone through half of them and dropped them down on the desk. . \"Ah, yes,\" he said, ''your work. Very interesting.· But not prac- tical. Not mature. Unfocused and undisciplined. Adolescent. Originality for originality's sake. Not at all in the spirit of the present day. If you want an idea of the sort of .thing for which there is a crying need-here-let me show you.\" He took a sketch out of a drawer of the desk. \"Here's a young man who came to me totally unrecommended, a beginner who had never worked before. When you can produce stuff like this, you won't find it necessary to look for a job. I saw this one sketch of his and I took him on at once, started him at twenty-five a week, too. There's no question but that he is a potential genius.\" He ex- tended the sketch to Roark. The sketch represented a house in the shape of a grain silo incredibly merged with the simplified, ema- ciated shadow of the Parthenon. ''That.\" said Gordon L. Prescott, \"is originality, the new in the eternal. Try toward something like this. I can't really say that I predict a great deal for your future. We must be frank, I wouldn't want to give you illusions based on my authority. You have a great deal to learn. I couldn't venture a guess on what tll.lent you might possess or develop later. But with hard work, perhaps ... Architecture. is a difficult profession, however, and the competi- tion is stiff, you know, very stiff ... And now, if you'll excuse me, my secretary has an appointment waiting for me .... \" Roark walked home late on an evening in October. It had been another of the many days that stretched into months behind him, and he could not tell what had taken place in the hours of that day, whom he had seen, what form the words of refusal had taken. He concentrated fiercely on the few minutes at hand, when he was in an office, ·forgetting everything else; he forgot these minutes when he left the office; it had to be done, it had been done, it concerned him no longer. He was free once more on·his way home. A long street stretched before him, its high banks, coming close together ahead, so narrow that he felt as if he could spread his arms, seize the spires and push them apart. He walked swiftly, the pavements as a springboard throwing his steps for- ward. He saw a lighted triangle of concrete suspended somewhere hundreds of feet above the ground. He could not see what stood below, supporting it; he was free to think of what he'd want to see there, what he would have made to be seen. Then he thought suddenly that now, in this moment, according to the city, accord- ing to everyone save that hard certainty within .him, he would never build again, never-before he had begun. He shrugged. Those things happening to him, in those offices of strangers, 101"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"were only a kind of sulrreality, unsubstantial incidents in the path of a substance they colikt not. reach or touch. He turned into side streets leading to the East River. A lonely traffic light hung far ahead, a spot of red in a bleak darkness. The old houses crouched low to the ground, hunched under the weight of the sky. The street was. empty and hollow, echoing to his footsteps. He went on,. his collar np.sed, his hands in his pock- ets. His shadow rose from under his heels, when he passed a light, and brushed a wall in a long .black arc, like the sweep of a windshield wiper. JoHN ERIK SNYTE looked through Roark's sketches, flipped three of them aside, gathered the rest into an even pile; glanced again at the three, tOssed them down one after another on top of the pile, with three sharp thuds, and said: · \"Remarkable. Radical, but remarkable. What are you doing to- night?\" · ' \"Why?\" asked Roark, stupefied. \"Are you free? Mind starting in at once? Take your coat off, go to the drafting room, borrow tools from somebody and do me up a sketch for a department store we're remodeling. Just a quick sketch, just a general idea, but I must have it tomorrow. Mind staying late tonight? The heat's on and I'll have Joe send you up some dinner. Want black coffee or Scotch or what? Just tell Joe. Can you stay?'' · \"Yes,\" said· Roark, incredulously. \"I can work all night.\" \"Fine! Splendid! that's just what I've always needed-a Cameron man. I've got every other kind. Oh, yes, what did they pay you at Francon's?'' \"Sixty-five.'' · \"Well, I can't splurge like Guy the Epicure. Fifty's tops. Okay? Fine. GO right in. l'll have Billings explain about the store to you. I want something modem. Understand? Modem, violent, crazy, to knock their eye out. Don't restrain yourself. Go the limit. Pull any stunt you can think of, the· goofier the better. Come on!\" John Erik Snyte shot to his feet, flung ·a door open into a huge draftina room, flew in, skidded agaipst a table, stopped, and said . to a stout man with a grim moon-face: \"Billings-Roark. He-'s our modernist. Give him the Benton store. Get him some instru:. ments. Leave him your keys and show him what to lock up to- night. Start him as of this morning. Fifty. What time was my appointment with Dolson Brothers? I'm late already. So long, I won't be back tonight.\" 102"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"He skidded out, slamming the door. Billings evinced no sur- prise. He looked at Roark as if Roark had always been there. He spoke impassively, in a weary drawl. Within twenty minutes he left Roark at a drafting table with paper, pencils, instruments, a set of plans and photographs of the department store, a set of charts and a long list of instructions. Roark looked at the clean white sheet before bim, his fist closed tightly about the thin stem of a pencil. He put the pencil down, and picked it up again, his thumb running softly up and down the smooth shaft; he saw that the pencil was trembling. He put it down quickly, and he felt anger at himself for the weakness of allowing this job to mean so much to him, for the sudden knowledge of what the months of idleness behind him had really meant. His fingertips were pressed to the paper, as if the paper held them, as a surface charged with electricity will hold the ·flesh of a man who has brushed against it, hold and hurt. He tore his fingers off the paper. Thim he went to work .... John Erik Snyte was fifty years old; he wore an expression of quizzical amusement, shrewd and unwholesome, as if he shared with .each man he contemplated a lewd secret which he would not mention because it was so obvious to them both. He was a prominent architect; his expression did not change when he spoke of this fact. He considered Guy Francon an· impractical idealist; he was nof restrained by an Classic dogma; he was .much more skillful and liberal: he built anything. He had no distaste for modem architecture and built cheerfully, when a rare client asked for it, bare boxes with flat roofs, which he called progressive; he built Roman mansions which he called fastidious; he built Gothic churches which he called spiritual. He saw no difference among any of them. He never became angry, except when somebody called him eclectic. He had a system of his own. He employed five designers of various types and·he staged a contest among them on each com- mission he received. He chose the winning design and improved it with bits of the four others. \"Six minds,\" he said, \"are better than one.\" When Roark saw the final drawing of the Benton Department Store, he understood why Snyte had not been afraid to hire him. He recognized his own planes of space, his windows, his system of circulation; he saw, added to it, Corinthian capitals, Gothic vaulting, Colonial chandeliers and incredible moldings, vaguely Moorish. The drawing was done in water-color, with miraculous delicacy, mounted on cardboard, covered with a veil of tissue pa- per. The men in the drafting room were not allowed to look at it, except from a safe distance; all hands had to be washed, all cig- arettes discarded. John Erik Snyte attached a great importance to the proper appearance of a drawing for submission to clients, and 103"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"kept a young Chinese student of architecture employed solely upon the execution of these masterpiee~. Roark knew what to expect of his job. He would never see his work erected, only pieces of it, which he preferred not to see; but he would be .free to design as he wished and he would have the experience of solving actual problems. It was less than he wanted and more than he could expect. He accepted it at that. He met his fellow designers, the four other contestants, and learned that they were unofficially nicknamed in the drafting room as \"Classic,\" \"Gothic,\" \"Renaissance\" and ·\"Miscellaneous.\" He winced a little when he was addressed as \"Hey, Modernistic.\" The strike of the building-trades unions infuriated Guy Francon. The strike had started against the contractors who were erecting the Noyes-Belmont Hotel, and had spread to all the new structures· of the city. It had been mentioned in .the press that the architects of the Noyes-Belmont were the firm of F{llllcon & Heyer. . Most of the press helped the fight along, urging the contractors not to surrender. The loudest attacks against the strikers came from ·the powerful papers of the great Wynand chain. ''We have always stood,\" said the Wynand editorials, \"for the rights of the common 1nan against the yellow sharks of privilege, but we cannot give our support to the destruction of law and or- der.\". It had never .been discovered whether the Wynand papers led the public or the public led the Wynand papers; it was known only that the nyo kept remarkably in step. It was not known to anyone, however, save to Guy Francon and a very few others, that Gail Wynand owned the corporation which owned the corpo- ration which owned the Noyes-Belmont Hotel. This added greatly to Francon's discomfort. Gail Wynand's real-estate operations were rumored to be vaster than his journal- istic empire. It was the first chance Francon .had ever had at a Wynand commission and he grasped it avidly, thinking of the possibilities which it could open. He and Keating had put their best efforts into designing the most ornate of all Rococo palaces for future patrons who could pay twenty-five dollars per day per room and who were fond of plaster flowers, marble cupids and open elevator cages of bronze lace. The strike had shattered the future possibilities; Francon could not be blamed for it, but one could never tell whom Gail Wynand would blame and for what reason. The unpredictable, unaccountable shifts of Wynand's fa- vor were famous, and it was well known that few architects he employed- once were ever employed by him again. Francon's sullen mood led him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in particular at the one person who had al- ways been immune from it-Peter Keating. Keating shrugged, and turned his back· to him in silent insolence. Then Keating 104"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"wandered aimlessly through the halls, snarling at young drafts- men without provocation. He bumped into Lucious N. Heyer in a doorway and snapped: \"Look where you're going!\" Heyer stared after him, bewildered, blinking. There was little to do in the office, nothing to say and every- one to avoid. Keating left early and walked home through a cold December twilight. At home, he cursed aloud the thick smell of paint from the overheated radiators. He cursed the chill, when his mother opened a window. He could fmd no reason for his restlessness, unless it was the sudden inactivity that_ left him alone. He could not bear to be left alone. He snatched· up the telephone receiver and called Catherine Halsey. The sound of her clear voice was like a hand pressed soothingly against his hot forehead. He said: \"Oh, nothing impor- tant, dear, I just wondered if you'd be home tonight. I thought I'd drop in after dinner.\" \"Of course, Pe~r. I'll be home.\" \"Swell. About eight-thirtyT' \"Yes ... Oh, Peter, have you heard about Uncle Ellsworth?\" \"Yes, God damn it, I've heard about your Un- cle Ellsworth! ... I'm sorry, Katie ... Forgive me, darling, I didn't mean to be rude, but I've been hearing about your uncle all day long. I know, it's wonderful and all that, only look,- we're not going to talk about him again tonight!\" \"No, of course not. I'm ·sorry. I understand. I'll be waiting for you.!' \"So long, Katie.'' He had heard the latest story about Ellsworth Toohey, but he did -not want to think of it because it brought him back to the an- noying subject of the strike. Six months ago, on the wave of his success with Sermons in Stone, Ellsworth Toohey had been signed to write \"One Small Voice,\" a daily syndicated column for the Wynand.papers. It appeared in the Banner and had started as a department of art criticism, but grown into an infonnal tri- bune from which Ellsworth M. Toohey pronounced verdicts on art, literature, New York restaurants, international- crises and sociology-mainly sociology. It had been a great success. But the , building strike had placed Ellsworth M. Toohey in a difficult po- sition. He made no secret of his sympathy with the strikers, but he had said nothing in his column, for no one could say what he pleased on the papers owned by Gail Wynand save Gail Wynand. However, a mass meeting of strike sympathizers had been called for this 'evening. Many famous men were to speak, Ellsworth Toohey among them. At least, Toohey's name had been an- nounced. The event caused a great deal of curious speculation and bets were made on whether Toohey would dare to appear. \"He will,\" Keating had heard a draftsman insist vehemently, \"he'll sacrifice himself. He's that kind. He's the only honest man in print.\" \"He won't,\" another had said. \"Do you realize what it means to pull 105"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"a stunt like that on Wynand? Once Wynand gets it in for a man, he'll break the guy for sure as hell's fire. Nobody knows when he'll do it or how he'll do it, but he~ll do it, and nobody'llprove a thing on him, and you're done for once you get Wynand after you.\" Keating did, not care about the issue one way or another, and the whole matter annoyed him. He ate his dinner, that evening, in grim silence and when Mrs. Keating began, with an \"Oh, by the way ... \" to lead the conver- sation in a direction he recognized, he snapped: \"You're not go- ing to talk about Catherine. Keep still.\" Mrs. Keating said nothing further and concentrated on forcing more food on his plate. He took a taxi to Greenwich Village. He hurried up the stairs. He jerked at the bell. He waited. There was no answer. He stood, leaning against the wall, ringing, for a long time. Catherine wouldn't be out when she knew he was coming; she couldn't be. He walked incredulously down the stairs, out to the street, and looked up at the windows_ of her apartment. The windows were dark. · He stood, looking up at the windows as at a tremendous be- trayal. Then came a sick . feeling of loneliness, as if he were homeless in a great city; for the moment, he forgot his own ad- dress or its existence. Then he thought of the meeting, the great mass meeting where her uncle was publicly to make a martyr of himself tonight. That's where she went, he thought, the damn lit- tle fool! He said aloud: ''To hell with her!\" ... And he was walk- ing rapidly in the direction of the meeting hall. . There was one naked bulb of light over the square frame of the hall's entrance, a small, blue-white lump glowing ominously, too cold and too bright. It leaped out of the dark street, lighting one thin trickle of rain from some ledge above, a glistening needle of glass, so thin and smooth that Keating thought crazily of stories where .men had been killed by being pierced with an icicle. A few curious loafers stood indifferently in the rain around the en- trance, and a few policemen. The door was open. The dim lobby was crowded with people who could not get into the packed hall, they were listening to a loud-speaker installed there for the occa- sion. At the door three vague shadows were handing out pam- phlets to passers-by. One of the shadows was a consumptive, unshaved young man with a.long, bare neck; the other was a trim youth with a fur collar on an expensive coat; the third was Cath- erine Halsey. She stood in the rain, slumped, her stomach jutting forward in weariness, her nose shiny, her eyes bright with excitement. Keating stopped, staring at her. . Her hand shot toward him mechanically with a pamphlet, then she raised her eyes and saw him. She smiled without astonish- ment and said happily: 106"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"\"Why, Peter! How sweet of you to come here!\" \"Katie ... \" He choked a little. \"Katie, what the hell ... \" \"But I had to, Peter.\" Her voice had no trace of apology. \"You don't understand, but I ... \" \"Get out of the rain.

I have to ... \" \"Get out of the rain at least, you fool!\" He pushed her roughly through the door, into a corner of the lobby. \"Peter darling, you're not angry, are you? You see,.it was like this: I didn't think Uncle would let me come here tonight, but at the last minute he said I could if I wanted to, and that I could help with the pamphlets. I knew you'd understand, and I left you a note on the living room table, explaining, and ... \" \"You left me a note? Inside?\" \"Yes . . . Oh . . .

Don't you know what he's sacrificing by coming here? And I knew he would. 'I told them so, those people who said not a chance, it'll be the end of him-and it might be, but he doesn't care.

I want to hear him and ... \" \"Shut up over there!\" someone hissed at them from the CTO)VQ·' \"We're missing it all,\" she whispered. \"That's Austen Heller speaking. Don't you want to hear Austen Heller?\" · Keating looked up at the loud-speaker with a certain respect, which he felt for all famous names. He had not read much of Austen Heller, but he knew that Heller was the star columnist of the Chronicle, a brilliant, independent newspaper, arch-enemy of the Wynand publications; that Heller came from an old, dis- tinguished family and had graduated from Oxford; that he had started as a literary critic and ended by becoming a quiet fiend devoted to the destruction of all forms of compulsion, private or public, in heaven or on earth; that he had been cursed by preachers, bankers, club-women and labor organizers; that he had better manners than the social elite whom he usually mocked, and a tougher constitution than the laborers whom he usually defended; that he could discuss the latest pJay on Broad- way, medieval poetry or international finance; that he never do- nated. to charity, but spent more of his own money than he could afford, on defending political prisoners anywhere. 107"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The voice coming from the loud-speaker was dry, precise, with the faint trace of a British accent. \" ... and we must con8ider,\" Austen Heller was saying unemo- tionally, ''that since-unfortunately-we are forced to live to- gether, the rriost important tiring for us to remember is that the only way in which we can have any law at all is to have as little of it as possible. I see no· ethical standard to which to measure the whole unethical conception of a State, except in the amount of time, of thought, of money, of effort and of obedience, which a society extorts from its every inember. Its value and its civili- zation are in inverse ratio to that extortion. There is no conceiv- able law by which a man can be forced to work on any terms except those he chooses to set. There is no conceivable law to prevent him from setting them-e-just as there is none to force his· employer to accept them. The freedom to agree or disagree is the foundation of our kind of society-and the freedom to strike is a part of it. I am mentioning this as a reminder to a certain Petronius from Hell's Kitchen, an exquisite bastard who has been rather noisy lately about telling us that this strike represents a de- struction of ·law and order.\" The loud-speaker poughed out a high, shrill sound of approval and a clatter of applause. There were gasps among the people in the lobby. Catherine grasped Keating's arm. \"Oh, Peter!\" she whispered. \"He means Wynand! Wynand was born in Hell's ·Kitchen. He can afford to say that, but Wynand will take it out on Uncle Ellsworth!\" Keating could not listen to the rest of Heller's speech, because his head w~ swimming in so violent an ache that the sounds hurt his eyes and he had to keep his eyelids shut tightly. He leaned against the wall. He opened his eyes with a jerk, when he became aware of the peculiar silence around him. ·He had not noticed the end of Hel- ler's speech. He saw the people in the lobby standing in tense, solemn expectation, and the blank rasping of the loud-speaker pulled every glance into its dark funnel. Then a voice came through the silence, loudly and slowly: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the great honor of presenting to you now Mr. Ellsworth Monkton Toohey!\" · Well, thought Keating, Bennett's won his six bits down at the office. There were a few seconds of silence. Then the thing which happened hit Keating on the back of the head; it was not a sound nor a blow, it was something that ripped time apart, that cut. the moment from the normal one preceding it. He knew only the shock, at frrst; a distinct, conscious second was gone before he realized what it was and that it was applause. It was such a crash of applause that he waited for the loud-speaker to explode; it went on and on and on, pressing agl!inst the walls of the lobby, and he thought he could feel the walls buckling out to the street. 108"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The people around .him were cheering. Catherine stood, her lips parted, and he felt certain that she was not breathing at all. It was a long time before silence came suddenly, as abrupt and shocking as the roar; the loud-speaker died, choking on a high note.

But I realize--:-and in that spirit I accept it-that this tribute was paid not to my pet- son, but to. a principle which chance has granted me to represent in all humility tonight.\" . It was not a voice, it was a miracle. It unrolled as a velvet ban- ner. It spoke English words, but the resonant clarity of each syl- lable made it sound like a new language spoken for the first time. It was the voice of a giant. · Keating stood, his mouth open. He did not hear what the voice was saying. He heard-the beauty of the sounds without mea:iling. He felt no need to know the meaning; he could accept anything, he wo.uld be led blindly· anywhere, · \" ... and so, my friends,\" the voice was saying, ''the lesson to be learned from our tragic struggle is the lesson of Ullity; We shall Ullite or we smtll be defeated.

It was cold, but they went on. to move, to feel the movement, to know the sensation of their own muscles :moving. \"We're getting drenched,\" Keating said atlast, as bluntly and naturally as he could; their silence frightened liim; it proved that they both ~ew the same thing and that the thing bad been real .. \"Let's find. some place where we can have a drink.\" \"Yes,\" said Catherine, \"let's.

She had men- tioned it quite naturally, with a healthy amount of proper regret. The thing was gone. \"But I wanted to be with you, Peter ... I want to be with you always.\" The thing gave a last jerk, not in the meaning of what she said, but in the reason that had prompted her to say it. Then it was gone, and Keating smiled; his fingers sought her bare wrist between her sleeve and glove, and her skin was warm against his. . . . · Many days later Keating beard the story that was being told all over town. It was said that on the day after the mass meeting Gail. Wynand bad given Ellsworth Toohey a raise in salary. Toohey bad been furious and bad tried to refuse it. \"You cannot bribe me, Mr. Wynand,\" be said. \"I'm not bribing you,\" Wynalid had answered; \"don't flatter yourself.\" When the strike was settled, interrupted construction went for- ward with a spurt throughout the city, and Keating found himself spendjng days arid nights at work, with new conunissions pour- ing into the office. Francon smiled happily at everybody and gave a small party for his staff, to erase the memory of anything he might·have said. The palatial residence of Mr. ·and Mrs. Dale . Ainsworth on ·Riverside Drive, a pet project of Keating's, done in Late Renaissance and gray granite, was complete at last. Mr. and . Mrs. Dale Ainsworth gave a formal reception as a housewarm- ing, to which Guy Francon and Peter Keating were invited, but Lucius N. Heyer was ignored, quite accidentally, as ~ways hap- pened to .him of late. Francon enjoyed the reception, because ev- ery square foot of granite in the house reminded him of the stupendous payment received by a certain tvanite quarry in Con- necticut. Keating enjoyed the reception, because the stately Mrs. Ainsworth said to him with a disarming smile: \"But I was cer- tllin that you were Mr. Francon's partner! It's Francon and Heyer, of course! How perfectly careless of mel All I can offer by way of excuse is that if you aren't his partner, one would certainly say you were entitled to be!\" Life in the office rolled on smOQthly, in one of those periods when everything seemed to go well. Keating was astonished, therefore, one morning shortly after the Ainsworth reception, to see Francon arrive at the office with a countenance of nervous irritation. \"Ob, nothing,\" be waved his hand at Keating impatiently, \"nothing at all/' In the drafting 110"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"room Keating noticed three draftsmen, their heads close together, bent over a section of the New York Banner, reading with a guilty kind of avid interest; he heard an unpleasant chuckle from one of them. When they saw him the paper disappeared, too quickly. He had no time to inquire into this; a contractor's job runner was waiting for him in his office, also a stack of mail and drawings to be approved. He had forgotten the incident three hours later in a rush of ap- pointments. He felt light, clear-headed, exhilarated by his own energy. When he had lo consult his library on a new drawing which he wished to compare with its best prototypes, he walked out of his office, whistling, swinging the drawing gaily . . His motion had propelled him halfway across the reception room, when he stopped short; the drawing swung forward and · flapped back against his knees. He forgot that it was quite· improper for him to P.ause there like that in the circumstances. A young woman stood before the railing, speaking to the re- ception clerk. Her slender body seemed out of all ~e in rela- tion to a normal human body; its lines were so long, so fragile, so exaggerated that she looked like a stylized drawing of- a woman and· made the correct proportions of a normal being ap~ pear heavy and awkward beside her. She wore a plain gray suit; the contrast between its tailored severity and her appearance was deh1Jerately exorbitant-and strangely elegant. She let the finger- tips of one hand rest on the railing, a narrow hand ending the straight imperious line of her arm. She had gray eyes that were not ovals, buttwo long, rectangular cuts edged by parallel lines of lashes; she had an air of cold serenity and an exqulsitely vi- cious mouth. Her face, her pale gold hair, her suit ~eemed to have no color,.but only a hint, just on the verge of the re~ty of col01:, making the full reality seem vulgar. Keating stood still, be- cause he understood for the first time ·what it was that artists spoke about when they spoke of beauty. \"I'll see him now, if I see him at all,\" she was Saying to the reception clerk. \"He asked me .to come and this is the only time I have.\" It was not a command; she spoke as if it were not nec- essary for her voice to assume the tones of commanding. \"Yes; but ... \" A light buzzed on the clerk's switchboard; she plugged the connection through, hastily. \"Ye5, Mr. Francon ... \" She lislened and nodded with relief. \"Yes, Mr. Francon.\" She turned to the visitor: \"Will you go right in; please?\" The young woman turned and looked at Keating as she passed him on her way to the stairs. Her eyes went past him without stopping. Something ebbed from his stunned admiration. He had had time to see her eyes; they seemed weary and a little con- temptuoUs, but they left him with a sense of cold cruelty . . He heard her walking up·the stairs, and the feeling vanished, 111"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"but th~ admiration remained. He approached· the reception clerk eagerly. · \"Who was thatT' he asked. The clerk shrugg~: \"That's the boss's little girl.\" · ''Why, the lucky stiff!\" said Keating; \"He's been holding out on me.\" \"You misunderstood me,\" the clerk said coldly. \"It's his daughter. It's Dominique Francon.\" \"Oh,\" said Keating. \"'h, Lord!\" ''YeahT' the girl looked at him sarcastically. \"Have you read this morning's BannerT' \"No. WhyT' ''Read it.\" Her switchboard buzzed and she turned away from him. He sen~ a boy for a copy of the Banner. and turned .anxiously to the column, \"Your l:louse,\" by Dominique Franeon. He had heard that she~d been quite successful lately with descriptions of the homes of prominent New Yorkers. Her field was confined to home decoration, but she ventured occasionally into architectural criticism. Today her subject· was the new residence of Mr. and Mrs. Dale Ainswortn on Riverside Drive. He read, among many other things, the following: · \"You enter a magnificent lobby of golden marble and you think that this is the City Hall or the Main Post Office, but it isn't It has, however, everything: the mezzanine with the colon- nade and the stairway with a· goitre and the cartouches in the form of looped leather belts. Only it's not leather, it's marble. The dining room has a splendid bronze gate, placed by mistake on the ceiling, in the shape of a trellis entwined with fresh bronze grapes. Theie are dead ducks and rabbits hanging on the wall panels, in bouquets of carrots, petunias and string beans. I do not think these would have been very attractive if real, but since they are bad plaster imitations, it is all right •.. The bedroom win- dows face a brick wall, not a very neat wall, but nobody needs to see the bedrooms .... The front windows are large enough and admit plenty of light, as well as the feet of the marble cupids that roost on the outside. The cupids are well fed and present a pretty pictul'e to the street, against the severe granite of the f~ade; they are quite commendable, unless you· just can't stand to look at dimpled soles every time you glance out to see whether it's raining. If you get tired of it, ·you can always look out of the cen- tral windows of the third floor, and into the cast-iron rump of Mercury who sits on top of the pediment over the entrance. It's a very beautiful entrance. Tomorrow, we shall visit the home of Mr. and Mrs. Smythe-Pickering.\" Keating had designed the house. But he could not help chuck- ling through his fury when he thought of what Francon must 112"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"have felt reading this, and of how Francon was going to face Mrs. Dale Ainsworth. Then he forgot the house and the article. He remembered only the girl who had written it. He picked three sketches at random from his table and started for Francon's office to ask his approval of the sketches, which he did .not need. On the stair landing outside Francon's closed door he stopped. He heard Fr:ancon's voice behind the door, loud, angry and help- less, the voice he always heard when Francon was beaten. \" •.• to expect such an outrage! From my own daughter! I'm used to anything from you, but this beats it all. What am l going to do? How am I going to explain? Do you have any kind of a vague idea of my position?\" . . Then Keating heard her laughing; it was a sound so gay and so cold that he knew it was best not to go in. He knew he did ilot want to go in, because he was afraid again; as he had been when he'd seen her eyes. He turned and descended the stairs. When he had reached the floor below, he was thinking that he would meet· her, that he would meet her soon and that Francon would not be able to pre- vent it now: He thought of it eagerly, laughing in relief at the pic- ture of Francon's daughter as he had imagined her for years, revising his vision of his future; even though he felt dimly that it would be better if he never met her again. 10 RALsroN HoLCOMBE had no visible neck, but his chin took care of that. His chin and jaws formed an unbroken arc, resting on his chest. His cheeks were pink, soft to. the touch, with the irresilient softness of age, like the skin of a peach that has been scalded. l£s rich white hair rose over his forehead and fell to his shoul- ders in the sweep of a medieval mane. It left .dandruff on the back of his collar. He walked through the streets of New York, Wearing a broad- brimmed bat, a dark business suit, a pale green satin shirt, a vest of white brocade, a huge black bow emerging from under his chin, and he carried a staff, not a cane, but a tall ebony staff sur- mounted by a bulb of solid gold. It was as if his huge body were resigned to the conventions of a prosaic civilization and to its drab garments, but the oval of his chest and stomach sallied forth, flying the colors of his inner soul. These things were permitted to him, because he was a genius. He was also president of the Architects' Guild of America. Ralston Holcombe did not subscribe to the views of his col- 113"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"leagues in the organization. He was not a grubbing builder nor a businessman. He was, he stated fihnly, a mlin of ideals. He denounced the deplorable state of American architecture and the unprincipled eclecticism of its practitioners. In any pe- riod of history, he declared, arclii.tects built in the spirit of their own time, and did not pick designs from the past; we could be · true to history only in heeding her law, which demanded that we plant the roots of our art firmly in the reality of our own life. He decried the_ stupidity of erecting buildings that were Greek, Gothic or Ronianesque; let us, he begged, be modern and build in the style that belongs to our days. He had found that style. It was Renaissance. · He stated his reasons clearly. Inasmuch, he pointed out, as nothing of great historical importance had happened in the world since the Renaissance, we should consider ourselves still living in that period; and all the outward fom'ls of our existence should remain faithful to the eJqUDples of the great masters of the six- teenth century. He had no patience with the few who spoke of a modern archi- tecture in terms quite different from his own; he ignored them; he stated only that men who wanted to break with all of the past were lazy ipOI'aJQuses, and that one could not put originality above ·Beauty. His voiCe trembled reverently on that last word.- He accepted nodiing but stupendous commissions. He specialized in the eternal and the monumental. He built a great many memori- als and capitols. He designed for International Expositions. He built like a composer improvising under the spur of a mys- tic guidance. He had sudden inspirations. He would add an enor- mous dome to the flat roof of a finished structure, or encrust a long vault with gold-leaf mosaic; Or rip off a f~ ofli~tone to replace it with marble. His clients turned pale, stuttered-and paid. His imperial perSonality carried him to victory in any en- counter with a client's thrift; behind him stood the stern, un- spoken, overwhelming assertion that he was an Artist. His prestige was enormous. .• · He came frOm a family listed in the. Social Register. In his middle years he had married a young lady whose family had not made the Social, Register, but Dlade piles of money instead, in a chewing-gum empire left to an only daughter. Ralston Holcombe was now sixty-five, to which he added a few years. for the sake of his friends' compliments on his won- derful physique; Mrs. Ralston Holcombe was forty-two, from which she deducted considerably. Mrs. Ralston Holcombe maintained a salon that met informally every Sunday afternoon. ''Everybody who is anybody in architec- .ture drops in on us,\" she told her friends. ''They'd better,\" she added. 114"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"On a Sunday afternoon in March, Keating drove to the H.olcombe mansion-a repi'Qduction of a Florentine palazzo- dutifully, but a little reluctantly.

The flames · of tall candles clashed desolately with the gray of the light from the street; the light made the candles seem dimmer, the candles gave to the day outside .. a premonitory tinge ·of dusk. A scale model of the new state capitol stood displayed on a pedestal in the middle of the room, ablaze with tiny electric bulbs. Mrs. Ralston Holcombe presided 9ver the tea table.- Each guest ~ted a fragile cup. of transparent porcelain; tQok two <re.Ucate sips and vanished in Ute direction of the bar. Two stately butlers went. about collecting the abandoned 'Cups. Mrs. Ralston Holcombe, as an enthusiastic girl friend had de- . scribed her, was \"petite, but intellectual,\" Her dimin11tive stature was her secret sorrow, but she ha4 learned to fina compensations. She could talk, and did, of wearing dresses size ten and of shop- ping in the junior department$. She wore high-school garments and short socks in summer, displaying spindly le~s with hard blue veins. She adored celebrities. That was her nussion in life. She hunted them grimly; she faced them with wide-eyed 8dmira- tion and spoke of her own insignificance, of her humility before · achievement; she shrugged, tight-lipped and rancorous, whenever one of them did not seem to take sufficient account of her own views on life anei: death, the theory of relativity, /U#c. archiiec- ture, birth control and the movies. She had a great many poor friends and advertised the fact. H a ,friend happened to improve his financial position, she dropped hiiD, feeling that he had com- mitted an act of treason. She hated the wealthy in all sincerity: they shared her only badge of distinction. She considered archi- tecture her private domain. She bad been christened Constance and found it awfully clever to be known as \"Kiki,'' a nickname she bad forced on her friends when she. was well past thirty. Keating had never felt .comfortable in Mrs. Holcombe's pres- ence, because she snilled at him too insistently and commented on his remarks by winking and saying: \"Why, Peter, how naughty of you!\" when no such intention had been in his mind at all. He bowed over her hand, however, .. tbis afternoon as usual, and she smiled from behind the silver teapot. She wore a regal 115"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"gown of emerald velvet, and a magenta ribbon in her bobbed hair with a cute little. bow in front. Her sJdil. was tanned and dry, with enlarged pores showing on her nosttils. She handed a cup to Keating, a square-cut emerald glittering on her finger in the can.- dlelighl · Keating expressed his admiration for the capitol and escaped to examine the model. He stood before it for a correct number of minutes, scalding his lips with the hot liquid that smelled of cloves. Holcombe, who never looked in the direction of the model and never missed a guest stopping before it, slapped Keating's shoulder and said sOmething _appropriate about young fellows learning the beauty of the style of the Renaissance. Then Keating wandered off, shook a few hands without enthusiasm, and glanced at his wrist watch, calculating the time when it would be permissible to leave. Then he stopped. · Beyond a broad arch, in a small library, with three young men beside her, he saw Dominique Francon: She stood leaning against a column, a cocktail ·glass in her hand. She wore a suit of black velvet; the heavy cloth, which transmitted no light rays, held her anchored to reality by stopping the light that flowed too freely through the flesh of her hands, her neck, her face. A white spark of fire flashed like a cold metallic cross in. the glass she held, as if it were a lens gathering the dif- fused radiance of her skin. Keating tore forward and found Francon in the crowd. ''Well, Peter!\" said Francon brightly. ''Want me to get you a drink?· Not so hot,\" he added, l9wering his voice, \"but the Man- hattans aren't too bad.\" \"No,'' said Keating, ''thanks!' \"Entre nous,\" said Francon, winking at the model of the cap- itol, \"it's a holy mess, isn't it?'' \"Yes,\" said Keating. \"Miserable proportions. . . . That dome · looks like Holcombe's face imitating a sunrise on the roof .... \" They had stopped in full view of the library and Keating's eyes were fixed on the girl in black, inviting Francon to notice it; he enjoyed having Francon in a trap; \"And the plan! The plan! Do you see that on the second floor ... oh,\" said Francon, noticing. · He looked at Keating, then at the library, then at Keating again. ''Well,'' said Francon at last, \"don't blame me afterward. You've asked for it Come on.\" They entered the library together. Keating stopped, correctly; but allowing his eyes an improper· intensity, while Fiancon beamed with unconvincing cheeriness: . '1>ominique, my deaf! May I present?-this is Peter Keating, my own right hand. Peter-my daughter.\" \"How do you do,\" said Keating, his voice soft. 116"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Dominique bowed gravely. \"I have waited to meet you foi: such a long time, Miss Francon.\" \"Tbis will be interesting,\" said Dominique. \"You will want to be nice to me, of course, and yet that won't be diplomatic.\" \"What do you mean, Miss Francon?'' \"Father would prefer you to be horrible with me.

You asked him for the introduction,. but he shouldn't have let me notice that How- ever, it's quite all right, since we both admit it. Sit down.\" She·slipped into a chair and he sat down obediently beside her. The young men :whom he did not know- stood about for a few minutes, trying -to be included in the conversation by smiling bl.ankly, then wandered off. Keating thought with relief that t(lere was nothing frightening about her; there was only a disquieting contrast between her words and ~candid innocence of the man- ner she used to utter them; he did not know which to trust ''I admit I itsked for the int:r9duction,\" he said.

But when he turned to her, she asked sweetly: ''What was it we were talking about, Mr. Keating?\" And then she was staring with too great an interest across the room, at the wizened figure of a little man coughing over a whisky glass.

He watched Domlnique Francon as she moved through the crowd, as she stopped in con- versation with others. She never· glanced at him again. He could not decide whether he had succeeded with her or failed misera- bly. . He managed to be at the door when she was leaving.

Keating followed him silently, amused, and said nothing when they were alone in the comfortable twilight of Francon's car. \"Well?\" Francon asked ominously. Keating smiled. \"You're a pig, Guy. You don't know how to appreciate what you've got. Why didn't you tell me?

He admitted he knew nothing about architecture. He didn't say whether he wanted it modernistic or period or what. He said something to the· effect that he wanted a house of his own, but he's hesitated for a long time about building one because all houses look alike to him and they all look like hell ~d he doesn't see how anyone can become enthusiastic about any house, and yet he has the idea that he wants a building he could love.

But I grant you that it d~sn't make sense ..•. · What's the matter, Roark?~' \"Nothing,\" said Roark. . This ended the first conference on the subject of a residence for Austen Heller. Later that day Snyte erowded his five designers into a train, and they went to Connecticut to see the site Heller had chosen. They stood on a lonely, rocky stretch of shore, three miles be- yond an unfashionable little town; they munched sandwiches and peanuts, and they looked at a cliff rising in broken ledges from the ground to end in a straight, brutal, naked drop over the sea, a vertical shaft of rock forming a cross with the long, pale hor;, izontal of the sea. ''There,\" said Snyte. ''That's it.\" He twirled a pencil in his hand. ''Damnable, ehT' He sighed. \"I tried to suggest a more re- spectable location, but he didn't take it so well so I had to shut up.\" He twirled the pencil, ''That's where he wants the house, 123"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"right on top of that rock.\" He scratched the tip of his nose with the point of the pencil. \"I tried to. su~t setting _it farther. back from the shore and keeping the dainn rock for a view, but that didn't go so well either.\" He bit the eraser between the tips of his teeth. \"Just think of the blasting, the leveling one's got to do on that top.\" He cleaned his fingernail with the lead, leaving a black mark. \"Well, that's that ....

Well, I think that's about all •... I'll help you with suggestions anytime .... Wen· . . . What time is that damn train backT' · Thus the five designers were started on their task. Four of them proceeded immediately at their drawing boards. Roark re- turned alone to the site, IJUillY times. Roarlc's five months wi~ Snyte stretched behind him like a blank. Had he wished to ask himself what he had felt, he would have found no answer, save in the fact that be remembered noth- ing of these months. He could remember each sketch he had made. He could, if he tried, remember what had happened to those sketches; he did not try. _ But he had not loved any .of .them as he loved the house of Austen Heller. He stayed in .tile drafting room through evening after evening, alone with a sheet of paper and the thought of a cliff over the sea. No one saw his. sketches until they were fin- ished. When they were finished, late one night, he sat at his table, with the sheets spread _before him, ·sat for many hours, one hand propping his forehead, the other hanging by his side, blood gath- ering in the .fingers, numbing them, while the street beyond the· window became deep blue, then pale gray. He did not look at the sketches. He felt empty and very tired. The house on the sketches had been !ksigned not by Roark, but by the cliff on which it stood. It was as if the cliff had grown and co~leted itself and proclaimed tbe PUIJX!Se for which ·it had been waiting. The house was broken into many levels, following the ledges of the rock, rising as it rose, in gradual masses, in planes flowing together up into one consummate harmony. The walls, of the same granite as the rock, continued its vertical lines upward; the wide, projecting terraces of concrete. silver· as the sea, followed the line of the waves, of the straight horizon. Roark was still sitting at his table when the men retuined to begin their day in the drafting room. Then the sketches were sent to Snyt¢'s office. - 1\\vo days later, the final version of the house to be submitted to Austen Heller, the version chosen and edited by John Erik Snyte, executed by the Chinese.artist, lay swathe<J in tissue paper on a table. It was Roark's bouse. His competitors had been elim- 124"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"inated. It was Roark's house. but its walls were now of red brick, its windows were cut to conventional size and equipped with green shutters, two of its projecting wings were omitted, the great cantilevered terrace over the sea was replaced by a little wrought- iron balcony, and the house was provided with an entrance of Ionic columns supporting a broken pediment, and with a little spire supporting a weather vane. · John Erik Snyte stood by the table, his two hands spread in the air over. the sketch, without touching the' virgin purity of its del- icate colors. \"That is what Mr. Heller bad in mind, I'm sure,'' be said ''Pretty good ... Yes, pretty good .•. Roark, bow many times do I have to ask you not to smoke around a final sketch? Stand away. You'll get ashes on it.\" Austen Heller was expected at twelve o'clock. But at half past eleven Mrs. Symington arrived unannounced and demanded to see Mr .. Snyte immediately. Mrs. Symington was an imposing dowager who had just moved into her new residence designed by Mr. Snyte; besides, Snyte expected a commission for an apart- ment bouse from her brother. He could not refuse to see her and be bowed her into his office, where she proceeded to state with- out reticence of expression that ·the ceiling of her library bad cracked and the bay windows of her dra\\Ving room were hidden under a perpetual veil of moisture which she could not combat. Snyte summoned his chief engineer and they launched together into _detailed explanations, apologies and damnations of contrac- tors. Mrs. Symington showed no sign of relenting when a signal buzzed on· Snyte's desk and the reception clerk's voice an- nounced Austen Heller. It would. have been impossible to ask Mrs. Symington to leave or Austen Heller to wait. Snyte solved the problem by abandon- jng her to the soothing speeeb ofhis engineer and excusing him- self for a moment. Then be emerged into the reception room, shook Heller's bancl and suggeste<t. ''Would yC)u mind stepping into the drafting room. Mr. Heller? Better light in there,· you know, and the sketch is all ready for you, and I didn't want to take the cbance of moving it.\" · Heller did not seem to mind. He followed Snyte obediently into the drafting room, a tall, broad-shouldered figure in English tweeds, with sandy hair and a square face drawn in countleSs creases lll'Qund the ironical calm ·or the eyes. The sketch lay on the Chinese artist's table, and the ·artist stepped aside diffidently, in silence. The next table ·was Roark's; He stood with his back to Heller; be went on with his drawing, and did not turn. The employees Had been trained not to intrude on the occasions when Snyte brought a client into the drafting room. · Snyte's fingertips lifted the tissue paper, as if raising the· veil 125"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"of a bride. Then he stepped back and watched Heller's face. Hel- ler bent down and stood hunched, drawn, intent, saying nothing for a long time. \"Listen, Mr. Snyte,\" he began at last. \"Listen, I think ... \" and stopped. , Snyte waited patiently, pleased, sensing the approach of some- th~ng he didn't want to disturb. ''This,\" said Heller suddenly, loudly, slamming his fist down on the drawing, and Snyte winced, \"this is the nearest anyone's ever come to it!\" \"I knew you'd like it, Mr. Heller,\" said Snyte. \"I don't,\" said Heller. Snyte blinked and waited. \"It's so near somehow,\" said Heller regretfully, \"but it's not right. I don't know where, but it's not. Do forgive me, if this sounds vague, but I like things at once or I don't. I know that I wouldn't be comfortable, for instance, with that entrance. It's a lovely entrance, but you won't even notice it because you've seen it so often.\" \"Ah, but allow me to point out a few considerations, Mr. Hel- ler. One wants to be modern, of course, but one wants to preserve the appearance of a home. A combination of stateliness and co- ziness, you understand, a very austere house like this must have a few softening touches. It is strictly correct architecturally.\" \"No doubt,\" said Heller. \"I wouldn't know about that. I've never been strictly correct in my life.\" \"Just let me expl$ this scheme and you'll see that it's ... \" \"I know,'' said Heller wearily. \"I know. I'm sure you're right. Only ... \" His voice had a sound of the eagerness he wished he could feel. \"Only, if it had some unity, some . . . some central idea ... which is there and isn't .... if it seemed to live .. . which it doesn't ... It lacks something and it has too. much ... . If it were cleaner, more clear-cut ... what's the word I've heard used?-if it were integrated .... \" . Roark turned. He was at the other side of the table. He seized the sketch, his hand flashed forward and a pencil ripped across the drawing, slashing raw black lines over the untouchable water- color. The lines blasted off the Ionic columns, the pediment, the entrance, the spire, the blinds, the bricks; they flung up two wings of stone; they rent the windows wide; they splintered the balcony and hurled a terrace over the sea. It was being done before the others had grasped the moment when it began. Then Snyte jumped forward, b11t Heller seized his wrist and stopped him. Roark's hand went on razing walls, split- ting, rebuilding in furious strQkes. Roark threw his head up once, for a flash of a second, to look at Heller across the table. It was all the introduction they needed; it was like a handshake. Roark went .on, and when he threw the 126"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"pencil doW~!_. the house-as he had designed it-stood completed in an ordered pattern of black streaks. The performance had not lasted five minutes. Snyte made an attempt at a sound. As Heller said nothing, Snyte felt free to whirl on Roark and scream: ''You're fired, God damn you! Get out of here! You're fired!\" ''We're both fired,\" said Austen Heller, winking to Roark. ''Come on. Have you had any lunch? Let's go some place. I want to talk to you.\" Roark went to· his locker to get his hat and coat. The drafting room witnessed a stupefying act and. all work stopped to watch it: Austen Heller picked up the sketch, folded it over four times, cracking the sacred cardboard, and slipped it into his pocket. ''But, Mr. Heller ... \" Snyte stammered, \"let me explain ... It's perfectly all right if that's what you want, we'll do the sketch over ... let me explain ... \" ''Not now,\" said Heller. \"Not now.\" He added at the door: ''I'll send you a check.\" · Then Heller was gone, and Roark with him; and the· door, as Heller swung it shut behind them, sounded like the closing para- graph in one of Heller's articles. Roark had not said a word. In the softly lighted booth of the most expensive restaurant that Roark had ever entered, across the crystal and silver glitter- ing between them, Heller·was saying: \" ... because that's the house I want, because that's the house I've always wanted. Can you build it for me, draw up the plans and supervise the construction?\" ·\"Yes,\" said ROark. ''How long Will it take if we start at once?'' \"About eight months.\" \"I'll have the house by late fall?\" \"Yes.\" \"Just like that sketch?'' \"Just like that.\" . ''Look, I have no idea what kind of a contract one makes with an architecf and you must know, so draw up one and let my law- yer okay it this afternoon, will you?'' \"Yes.\" Heller studied the man who sat facing him. He saw the hand lying on the table before him. Heller's awareness became focused on that hand. He saw the long fingers, the sharp joints, the prom- inent veins. He had the feeling that he was not hiring this man, but surrendering himself into his employment. \"How old are you,\" asked Heller, ''whoever you are?'' . ''Twenty-six. Do you want any references?'' \"Hell, no. I have them, here in my pocket. What's your name?\" 127"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"\"Howard Roark.\" Heller produced a checkbOok, spread it open on the table and reached for his fountain pen. \"Look,\" he said, writing, \"I'll give you five hundred dollars on account. Get your!ielf an office or whatever you have to get, and go ahead.\" . He tore off the check and handed it to Roark, between the tips of two straight fingers, leaning forward on his elbow. swinging his wrist in a sweeping curve. His eyes were narrowed, amused, watching Roark quizzically. But the gesture had the air of a sa- lute. The check was made out to \"Howard Roark, Architect.\" 11 HowARD RoARK opened his own office. It was one large room on the top of an old building, with a broad window high over the roofs. He could see the distant band of the Hudson at his window sill, with the small streaks of ships moving under his fingertips when he pressed them to the glass. He had a desk, two chairs, and a huge drafting table. The glass entrance door bore the words: \"Howard Roark, Architect.\" He stood in the hall for a long time, looking at the words. Then he went in, and slammed his door; he picked up a T-square from the table and flung it down again, as if throwing an anchor. John Erik Snyte had objected. When Roark came to the office for his drawing instruments Snyte emerged into the reception room, shook his hand warmly and said: \"Well, Roark! Well, how are you? Come in, come right in, I want to speak to you!\" And with Roark seated before his desk Snyte proceeded loudly: \"Look, fellow, I hope you've got sense enough not to hold it against me, anything that I might've said yesterday. You .Jcnow how it is, I lost my head a little, and it wasn't what you did, but that you had to go and do it on that sketch, that sketch ... well, never mind. No hard feelings?\" \"No,\" said Roark. \"None at all.\" \"Of course, you're not fired. You didn't take me seriously, did you? You can go right back to work here this very minute.\" ''What for, Mr. Snyte?\" . ''What do you mean, what for? Oh, you're thinking of the Hel- ler house? But you're not taking Heller seriously, are you? You saw how he is, that mach1um can change his mind sixty times a minute. He won't really give you that commission, you know, it isn't as simple as that, it isn't being done that way.\" \"We've signed the contract .yesterday.\" 128"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"\"Oh, you have? Well, that's splendid! Well, look, Roark, I'll tell you what we'll do: you bring the commission back to us and I'll let you put your name on it with mine-'John Erik Snyte & Howard Roark.' And we'll split the fee. That's in addition to your salary-and you're getting a raise, incidentally. 1'ben we'll have the same arrangement on any other commission you bring in. And . . . Lord, man, what are you laughing at?'' \"Excuse me, Mr. Snyte. I'm sorry.\" \"I don't believe you understand,\" said Snyte, bewildered. \"Don't you see? It's your insurance. You don't want to break- loose_ just yet Commissions won't fall into your lap like this. Then what will you do? This way, you'll have a steady job and you'll be building toward independent practice, if that's what you're after. In four or fiv~ years, you'll be ready to take the leap. That's the way everybody does it. You see?'' \"Yes.\" \"Then you agree?'' \"No.\" \"But, good Lord,·man, you've lost your mind! To set up alone now? Without experience, without connections, without - ... well, without anything at all! I never heard of such a thing. Ask any- body in the profession. See what they'll tell you. It's preposter- ous!\" \"Probably.'' \"Listen. Roark, won't you please 1isten7\" \"I'll listen if you want me to, Mr. Snyte. But I think I should tell you now that nothing you can say will make any difference. If you don't mind that, I don't mind listening.'' Snyte went on speaking for a long time and. Roark listened, without objecting; explaining or answering. \"Well, if that's how you are, don't expect me to take you back when you find yourself on the pavement.\" - \"I don't expect it, Mr. Snyte.'' \"Don't expect anyone else in the profession to take you in, af- ter they hear what you've done to me.\" \"I -don't expect that either.\" For a few days Snyte thought of suing Roark and Heller. But he decided against it, because there ·was no precedent. to follow under the circumstances: because Heller had paid him for his ef- forts, and the house hai:l been actually desiped by Roark; and because no one ever sued Austen Heller. The first visitor to Roark's office was Peter Keating. He walked in, without warning, one noon, walked strai~t across the room and sat down on Roark's desk, smiling gaily, spreading his arms wide in a sweeping gesture: \"Well, Howard!\" he said. \"Well, fancy that!\" He had not seen Roark for a year. \"Hello, Peter,\" said Roark. 129'"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"\"Your own office, your own name 81¢ eyerything! ~y!

I thought, when I heard the story, that you'd surely tum it over to Snyte. and make a smart deal with him.\" \"I. didn't.\" \"Aren't you really going to?\" \"No.\" Keating wondered why be should experience that sickening feeling of resentment; why be bad come here hoping to find the story untrue, hoping to find Roark uncertain and willing to sur- render. That feeling bad haunted him ever since he'd heard the news about Roark; the sensation of something unpleasant that re- mained after he'd forgotten the cause. The feeling w.ould come back to him, without reason, a blank wave of anger, and he would ask himself: now what the bell?-wbat was it I beard to- day? Then lie would remember: Ob, yes, Roark-Roark's opened his own office. He would ask himself impatiently: So wbat?- and know at the same time that the words were painful to face, and humiliating like an insult. . \"You know, Howard, I admire your courage. Really, you know, I've bad much more expefience and I've got more of a standing in the profession, don't mind my saying it-I'm only speaking objectively-but I wouldn't dare take such a step.\" ''No, you wouldn't.\" \"So you've made the jump first. Well,. well. Who would have thought it? ... I wish you all the luck in the world.'' \"Thank you, Peter.\" \"I know you'll succeed. I'm sure of it.\" \"Are you?\" . \"Of course! Of course, I am. Aren't you?'' ''I haven't thought of it.\" 130"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"\"You haven~t thought of it?'' \"Not much.\" \"Then you're not sure, Howard? You aren't?\" \"Why do you ask that so eagerly?\" ''What? Why ... no, not eagerly, but of course, I'm concerned, Howard, it's bad psychology not to be certain now, in your posi- tion. So you have doubts?\" \"None at all.\" \"But you said ... \" \"I'm quite sure of things, Peter.\" \"Have you thought about getting your_ registration?\" \"I've applied for it.\" \"You've got no college degree, you know. They'll make it dif- ficult for you at the examination.\" \"Probably.\" ''What are you going to do if you don't get the license?'' \"I'll get it.\" \"Well, I guess I'll be seeing you now at the A.G.A., if you don't go high hat on me, because you'll be a full-fledged mem- ber and I'm only a junior.\" ''I'm not joining the A.G.A.\" \"What do you mean, you're not joining? You're eligible now.\" \"Possibly.\" \"You'll be invited to join.\" \"Tell them not to bother.\" ''What!\" \"You know, Peter, we had a conversation just like this seven years ago, when you tried to talk me into joining your fraternity at Stanton. Don't start it again.\" \"You won't join the A.G.A. when you have a chance to?\" ''I won't join anything, Peter, at any time.\" \"But don't you realize how it helps?\" \"In what?'' \"In being an architect.\" ''I don't like to be helped in being an architect.\" \"You're just making things harder for yourself.\" \"I am.\" \"And it will be plenty hard, you know.\" \"I know.\" \"You'll make enemies of them if you refuse such an invita- tion.\" \"'I'll make enemies of them anyway.\" The first person to whom Roark had told the news was Henry Cameron. Roark went to New Jersey the day after he signed the contract with Heller. It had rained and he found Cameron in the garden, shuffling slowly down the damp paths, leaning heavily on a cane. In the past winter, Cameron had improved enough to walk a few hours each day. He walked with effort, his body bent. 131"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"He looked at the first shoots of green on the earth under his feet. He lifted his cane, once in a while, bracing his legs to stand finn for a inoment; with the tip of the cane, he touched a folded green cup and watched it spill a glistening drop, in the twilight. He.· saw Roark criming up the bill, and frowned. He had seen Roark only a .week ago, and becan!le these visits meant too much to both of them, neither wished the occasion to be too frequent \"Well?\" Cameron asked gruffly. \"What do you want here again?'' \"I have something to tell you.\" \"It can wait.\" ·\"I don't think so.\" ''Well?'' \"I'm opening my own office. I've just signed for my first building.\" Cameron rotated his cane, the tip pressed into the earth, the shaft describing a wide circle, his two hands bearing down on the handle, the palm of one on the back of the other. His head nod- ded slowly, in rhythm with the motion, for a long tiine, his eyes closed. Then he looked at Roark and said: . · ''Well, don't brag about it.\" He added:. \"Help me to sit down.\" It was the first time Cameron had ever pronounced this sentence; his sister and Roark had long since learned that the one outrage forbidden in his pres- ence was any intention of helping hitn to move. Roark took his elbow and led him to a bench. Cameron asked harshly, staring ~ at the sUJl&et: ·~t? For \\Vhom?llow much?'' . He listened silently to Roark's story. He looked for a long time at the. sketch on cracked cardboard with the pencil lines over the watercolor. Then he asked many questions about the stone, the steel, the roads, the contractQrs, the costs. He .offered no congrat- ulations. He made no· comment. Only when Roark was leaving, Cameron said suddenly: ''Howard, wh~ you open your office, • snapshots of it- and show them. to me.\" · Tium he shook his head, looked away guiltily, and swore. ''I'm being senile. Forget it.\" Roark said nothing. Three days later be came back, \"You're getting to be a nui- sance,\" said Cameron. Roark handed him an envelope, without a word. Cameron looked at the snapshots, at the one of the broad, bare office, of the wide window. of the entrance door. He dropped the others~ and held the one of the entrance door for a long tiine. · ''Well,'' he said at last, ''I did live. to see it.\" He dropped the snapShot. \"Not quite exactly,\" he added. ''Not in the way I had wanted 132"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"to, but I did. It's like the shadows some say we'll see of the earth in that other world. Maybe that's how I'll see the rest of it. I'm learning.\" He picked up the snapshot. \"Howard,\" he said. \"Look at it.\" He held it between them. \"It doesn't say much. Only 'Howard Roark, Architect.' But it's like those mottoes men carved over the entrance of a castle and died for. It's a challenge in the face ~f something so vast and so dark, that all the pain on earth-and do you know how much suf- fering there is on earth?~all the pain comes from that thing you are going to face. I don't know what it is, I don't know why it should be unleashed against you. I know only that it will be. And I know that if you carty these words through to the end, it will be a victory, Howard, not just for you, but for something that should win, that moves the world-and never wins acknowledg- ment. It will vindicate so many who have fallen before you, who have suffered as you will suffer. May God bless you-or who- ever it is that is alone to see the best, the highest possible to hu- man hearts. You're on your way into hell, Howard.'' Roark walked up the path to the top of the cliff where the steel hulk of the Heller house rose into a blue sky. The skeleton was up and the concrete was being poured; the great mats of the ter- races hung over the silver sheet of water quivering far below; plumbers and electricians had started laying their conduits. He looked at the squares of sky delimited by the slender lines of .girders and columns, the empty cubes of space he had tom out of the sky. His hands moved involuntarily; filling in the planes of walls to come, enfolding the future rooms. A stone. clattered from under his feet and went bouncing down the bill, .resonant drops of sound rolling in the sunny clarity of .the summer air. He stood on .the summit, his legs planted wide apart,. leaning back against space. He looked at the materials before him, the knobs of rivets in steel, the sparks in blocks of stone, the weav- ing spirals in fresh, yellow planks. . Then he saw a husky figure enmeshed in electric wires, a bull- dog face spreading into a huge grin and china-blue eyes gloating in a kind of unholy triumph. ''Mike!\" he said incredulously. Mike had left for a big job in Philadelphia months ago, long before the appearance of Heller in Snyte's office, and Mike had never heard the news-or so he supposed. . \"Hello, Red,\" said Mike,. much too casually, and added: \"Hello, boss.'' · . \"Mike, how did you ... ?\" \"You're a hell of an architect. Neglecting the job like that. It's my third day here, waiting for you to show up.\" 133"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"\"Mike, how did you get here? Why such a come-down?'' He bad never known Mike to bother with small private residences. \"Don't play the sap. You know how I got here. You didn't think I'd miss it, your first house, did you? And you think it's a come-down? Well, maybe it is. And maybe it's the other way around.\" Roark extended his hand and Mike's grimy fingers closed about it ferociously, as if the smudges he left implanted in Roark's skin said everything ·he wanted to say. And because he was afraid that he might say it, Mike growled: \"Run along, boss, run along. Don't clog up the works like that.\" Roark walked through the house. The~ were moments when he could be precise, impersonal, and stop to give instructions as if this were not his house but only a mathematical problem; when he felt the existence of pipes and rivets, while his own person vanished. There were moments when something rose within him, not a thought nor a feeling, but a wave of some physical violence, and then he wanted to stop, to lean back, to feel the reality of his per• son heightened by the frame of steel that rose dimly about the bright, outstanding existence of his body as its center. He did not stop. He went on calmly. But his hands betrayed what he wanted to hide. His hands reached out, ran slowly down the beams and joints. The workers in the house had noticed it. They said: ''That guy's in love with the thing. He can't keep his hands off.\" The workers liked him. The contractor's superintendents did not. He had bad trouble in finding a contractor to erect the house. Several of the better firms bad refuSed the commission. ''We don't do that kinda stuff.\" ''Nah, we won't bother. Too compli- cated for a small job like that.\" \"Who the hell wants that kind of house? Most likely we'll never'-collect from the crank afterwards; To hell with it.\" \"Never did anything like it. Wouldn't know how to go about it I'll stick to construction that is construction.\" One contractor bad looked at the plans briefly and thrown them aside, declaring with finality: \"It won't stand.\" \"It will,\" said Roark. The contractor drawled indifferently. \"Yeah? And who are you to tell me, Mister?'' He had found a small firm that needed the work and undertook it, charging more than the job warranted-on the. ground of the chance they were taking with a queer experiment The construc- tion went on, and the foremen obeyed sullenly; in disapproving silence, as if they were waiting for their predictions to come true and would be glad when the house collapsed about their heads. Roark had bought an old Ford and drove down to the job more often than was necessary. It was difficult to sit at a desk in his of- fice, to stand at a table, forcing himself to stay away from the construction site. At the site there were moments whep he wished 134"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"to forget his office and his drawing board, to seize the men's tools and go to· work on the actual erection ·of the house, as he had worked in his childhood, to build that house with his own hands. · He walked through the structure, stepping lightly over piles of planks and coils of wire, he made notes, he gave brief orders in a harsh voice. He avoided looking in Mike's direction. But Mike was watching him, following his progress through the bouse. Mike winked at him in understanding,· whenever he passed by. Mike said once: \"Control yourself, R,ed. You're open like a book. God, it's in~ decent to be so happy!\" Roark stood on the cliff, by the structure, and looked at the countryside,. at the ·tong, gray ribbon of the road twisting past along the shore. An open car drove by, fleeing into the country. The car was overfilled with people bound for a picnic, There was a jumble of bright sweaters, and scarfs fluttering in the wind; a jumble of voices shrieking without purpose over the roar of the motor, and overstressed hiccoughs of laughter; a girl sat sidewise, her legs flung over the side of the car; she wore.a man's straw hat slipping down to her nose and she yanked savagely at the strings of a ukulele, ejecting raucous sounds, yelling \"Hey!\" These people were enjoying a· day of their existence; they were shrieking to the sky their release from the work and the burdens of the days behind them; they had worked and carried the bur~ dens in order to reach a goal-and this was• the goal. He looiCed at·the car as it streaked past. He thought that there was a difference, some important difference, between the con- sciousness of this day . in him and in them. He thought that he should try to grasp it. But he forgot. He was looking at a truck ·panting up the hill, loaded with a glitterib.g mound of cut granite. Austen Heller came to look at the house frequently, and . watched it grow, curious, still a little astonished. He studied Roark and the house with the same meticulous scrutiny; he felt as if he could not quite tell them apart. · Heller, the fighter against compulsion~ was baftled by Roark, a man so impervious to complJ}sion that he became a kind of com- pulsion himself, an ultimatum against things Heller COIJld not de- fine. Within a week, Heller knew that ·he had found the best friend he would ever have; and he knew that the friendship came from Roark's fundamental indifference. In the deeper J,llality of Roark's existence there was no consciOUSJlel!S of Heller, no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. Heller felt a line drawn, which he could not touch; beyond that line, Roark asked nothing of him and granted him nothing. But when Roark looked at hitD with ap- proval, when Roark smiled, when Roark praised one of his arti- 135"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"cles, Heller felt the strangely clean joy of a sanction that was neither a bribe nor alms. · · In the summer evenings they sat together on a ledge halfway up the hill, and talked while darkness mounted slowly .up the beams of the bouse above them, the last slinrays retreating to the tips of the steel uprights. \"What is it that I like so much about the bouse you're building for me, Howard?'' \"A bouse can have integrity, just like a person,\" said Roarlc, \"and just as seldom.\" · \"In what way?'' ''Well, look at it. Every piece of it is there because the bouse needs it-and for no other reason. You see it from here as it is inside. The rooms in which you'll live made the shape. There- lation of masses was determined by the distribution of space within. The ornament was determined by the method of construc- tion, an emphasis of the principle that makes it stand. You can see each stress, each support that meets it. Your own· eyes go through a structural process when you look at the bouse, you· can follow each step, you see it rise, you know what made it and why it stands. But you've seen buildings with columns that support nothing, with purposeless cornices; with pilasters, moldings, false arches, false windows. You've seen buildings that look as if they contained a single large hall, they have solid columns and single, solid windows six floors high. But you enter and find six stories inside. Or buildings that contain a single hall, but with a f~ade cut up into floor lines, band courses, tiers of windows. Do. you understand .the difference? Your bouse is made by its owri needs. Those others are made by ~ need to impress. The determining motive of your bouse is in the bouse. The determining motive of the others is in the audience.\" \"Do you know that that's what I've felt.in a way? I've felt that when I move into this house, I'll have a new sort of existence, and even my simple daily routine will have a kind of honesty or dignity that I can't quite define. Don't be astonished if I tell you that I feel as if I'll have to live up to that bouse.\" \"I intended that,\" said Roark. . \"And, incidentally, thank you for all the thought you seem to -..have. taken about my comfort. There are so many things I notice that bad never occurred to me before, but you've planned them as if you knew all my needs. For instance, my study is the room I'll need most and you've given it the dominant spot-and, inci- dentally, I see where you've made it the dominant mass frOm the outside, too. And· then the way it connects with the libriuy, and the living room well out of my way, and the guest rooms where I won't bear too much of them-and all that. You were very con- siderate of me.\" \"You know,\" said Roark. \"I haven't thought of you at all. I 136"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"thought of the house.\" He added: \"Perhaps that's why I knew how to be considerate of you.\" · The Heller house was completed in November of 1926. In January of 1927 the Architectural Tribune published a sur- vey of the best American homes erected during the past year. It devoted twelve large, glossy pages to photographs of the twenty- four houses its editors had selected as the worthiest architectural achievements. The Heller house was not mentioned. The real-estate sections of the New York papers presented, each Sunday, brief accounts of the notable new residences in the vicinity. There was no account of the Heller house. The year book of the Architects' Guild of America, which pre- sented magnificent reproductions of what it chose · as the best buildings of the country, under the title \"Looking Forward,\" gave no reference to the Heller house. There were many occasions when lecturers rose to platforms and addressed trim audiences on the subject of the progress of American architecture. No one spoke of the Heller house. In the club rooms of the A.G.A. some opinions· were ex- pressed. \"It's a disgrace to the country,\" said Ralston Holcombe, \"that a thing like that Heller house is allowe(f to ~ erected. It's a blot on the profession. There ought to be a law.\" ''That's what drives clients away,\" said John Erik Snyte. \"They see a house like that and they think all architects are crazy.\" · ''I see no cause_ for indignation,\" said Gordon L. Prescott. '1 think it's screatl)ingly funny. It looks like a cross between a fill- ing station and a comic-strip idea of a rocket ship to the moon.\" \"You watch it in a couple of years,\" said Eugene Pettingill, \"and see what' happens. The thing'll collapse like a house of cards.\" ''Why speak in terms of years?'' said Guy Francon, ''Those modernistic stunts never last more than a season. The owner will get good and sick of it and he'll come running home to a good old early Colonial.\" The Heller house acquired fame throughout the countryside surrounding it. People drove out of their way to park on the road before it, to stare, point and mggle. Gas-station attendants snick- ered when Heller's car drove past. Heller's cook had to endure th~ derisive glances of shopkeepers when she went on her ·er- rands. The Heller house was known in the neighborhood as ''The Booby Hatch.\" Peter Keating told his frierids in the profession, with an indul- gent smile: \"Now, now, you shouldn't say that about him. I've known Howard Roark for a long time, and he's got quite a talent, quite. He's even worked for me _once. He's just gone haywire on 137"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"that house. He'll learn.

It was a trusteci guide, a source of inspiration and a molder of public philosophy in small towns throughout the country. In this column there had appeared, yelll'S ago, the famous statement: \"We'd all be a heaP sight better off if we'~ forget the highfalutin notions of our fancy civilization and mind more what the savages knew long before us: to honor our mother.\" Alvah Scarret was a bachelor, had made two millions dollars, played golf expertly and was editor-in-chief of the Wynand papers. It was Alvah Scarret who conceived the idea of the campaign against living conditions in the slums and \"Landlord Sharks,\" which ran in the Banner for three weeks. This· was material such as Alvah Scarret relished. It had human appeal and social impli- cations. It lent itself to Sunday-supplement illustrations of girls leaping into rivers, their skirts flaring well above their knee8. It boosted circulation. It embarrassed the sharks who owned a stretch of blockS by the East River, selected as the dire example of the campaign.\" The sharks had refused to sell these blocks to an obscure real-estate company; at the end of the campaign they .surrendered and sold. No one eould prove that the real-estate company was owned by a company owned by Gail Wynand. The Wynand papers could not be left without a campaign for long. They had just concluded one on the subject of modern avi- ation. They had run scientific accounts of the history of aviation in the Sunday Family Magazine supplement, with pictures rang- ing from Leonardo da Vmci 's drawmgs of flying machines to the latest bomber; with the added attraCtion of Icarus writhing in scarlet flames, his nude body· blue-green, his wax wings yellow and the smoke purple;· also of a leprous hag with flaming eyes and a crystal ball, who had predicted in the Xlth century that man would fly; also of bats, vampires and werewolves. They had run a model plane coristruction contest; it was open to all boys under the age of ten who wished to send in three new subscriptions to the Banner. Gail Wynand, who was a licensed pi- lot, had made a solo flight from .Los Angeles to New York, estab- 138"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"lishing a transcontinental speed record, in a small, specially built craft costing one hundred thousand dollars. He had made a slight miscalculation on reaching New York and had been forced to land in a rocky pasture; it had been a hair-raising landing, fault- lessly executed; it had just so happened that a battery of photog- raphers from the Banner were present in the neighborhood. Gail Wynand had stepped out of the plane. An ace pilot would have been shaken by the experience. Gail Wynand had stood before the cameras, an immaculate gardenia in the lapel of his flying jacket, his hand raised with a cigarette held between two fingers that did not tremble. When questioned about his first wish on re- turning to earth, he had expressed the desire to kiss the most at- tractive woman present, had ch9sen the dowdiest old.hag from the crowd and bent t<l kiss her gravely on the forehead, ex- plaining that she reminded him of his mothet:. Later, at the-start of the slum campaign, Gail Wynand had said to Alvah Scarret; \"Go ahead. Squeeze all you can out of the thing,\" aad had departed on his yacht for a world cruise, accom- panied by an enchanting aviatrix of twenty~four to whom he had made a present of his transcontinental plane. ·.Alvah Scarret went .ahead. Among many other steps of his campaign he assigned Dominique Franeon to investigate the con- dition of homes in the slums and to gather human material. Do- minique Francon ·had just returned from a summer in Biarritz; she always took a whole summer's vacation and _Alvah Scarret granted .it, because she was one of his favorite employees, be- cause he ·was baffled by her and because he knew that she could quit her·job whenever she please4. Dominique Francon went to live for two weeks in the hall bed- room of an East-Side tenement The room .had a skylight, but no windows; there were five flights of stairs to climb and no run- ning water. She cooked her own meals in the kitchen of a numer- ous family on the floor below; she visited neighbors, she sat on the landings of fire escapes in the evenings and went to dime movies with the girls of the neighborhood. She wore frayed skirts and blouses. The abno~ fragility of her normal appearance made her look exhausted with privation in these surroundings; the neighbors felt certain that she had TB. But she moved as she had moved in the drawing room of Kiki Holcombe-with the same cold poise and confidence. She scrubbed. the floor of. her room, she peeled potatoes, she bathed in a tin pan of cold water. She had never done these things. be- fore; she did them expertly. She had a capacity for action, a com- petence that clashed incongruously with her appearance. She did not mind this new background; she was indifferent to the shims as sbe .had been indiffel'!mt to the drawing rooms. At the end of two weeks she returned to her penthouse apart- ment on the roof of a hotel over Central Park, and her articles on 139"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"life in the slums appeared in the Banner. They were a merciless, brilliant account. She heard baffled .questions at a dinner party. \"My dear,. you didn't actually write those thingsT' ''Dominique, you didn't re- ally live in that placeT' \"Ob, yes,\" she answered. \"The bouse you own on East Twelfth Street, Mrs. Palmer,\" she said, her band cin:ling lazily from under the cuff of an emerald bracelet too broad and heavy for her thin wrist, \"bas a sewer that gets clogged every other day and runs over, all through the eourtyard. It looks blue and purple in the sun, like a rainbow.\" \"The block you control for the Claridge estate, Mr. Brooks, bas the most at- tractive stalactites groWing on all the ceilings,\" she said, her golden bepd leaning to her corsage of white gardenias with drops of water sparkling on the lusterless petals. She was asked to speak at a meeting of social workers. It was an important meeting, with a militant, radical mood, led by some of the most prominent women in the field. Alvah Scarret was pleased and gave her his blessing. \"Go to it, kid,\" be said, \"lay it on thick. We want the social workers.\" She stood in. the speak- er's pulpit of an unaired ball and looked at a flat sheet of faces, faces lecherously eager with the sense of their own virtue. She spoke evenly, without inflection. She said, among many other things: \"'The family on the first floor rear do not bother to pay their rent, and the children cannot go to school for lack of clothes. The father bas a charge account at a comer speak-easy. He is in good health and bas a good job, ... The couple on the second floor have just purchased a radio for sixty-nine dollars and ninety-five cents cash. In the fourth floor front, the father of the family bas not done a whole day's work in his life, and does not intend to. There are nine children, supported by the local par- ish. There is a tenth one on its way ... \" When she finished there were a few claps of angry applause. She· raised her band and s&id: \"You don't lulve to applaud. I don't expect it.\" She asked politely: \"Are there any questionsT' There were no questions. When she returned home she found Alvah Scarret waiting for her. He look¢ incongruous in the drawing room of her pent- bouse, his huge bulk perched on the edge of a delicate chair, a bunched gargoyle against the glowing spread of the 'city beyond a solid wall of glass. The city wils like a mural designed to illu- minate and complete the room: the fragile lines of spires on a black sky continued the. fragile lines of the furniture; the lights glittering in distant windows threw reflections on the bare, lus- trous floor;· the cold precision of .the angular structures outside answered the-cold, inflexible grace of every object within. Alvah Scarret brOke the harmony .. He looked like a kindly country doc- tor and like a cardsharp. His heavy face. bore the benevolent, pa- ternal smile that bad always been his passkey and his trademark. He bad the knack of making the kindliness of his smile add to, 140"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"not detract from his solemn appearance of dignity; his long, thin, hooked nose did detract from the kindliness, but it added to the dignity; his stomach, cantilevered over his legs, did detract from the dignity, but it added to the kindliness. He rose, beamed and held Dominique's hand. ''Thought I'd drop in on my way home,\" he said. \"I've got something to tell you. How did it go, kid?\" \"As I expected it.\" She tore her hat off and threw it down on the first chair in sight. Her hair slanted in a flat curve across her forehead and fell in a straight line to her shoulders; it looked smooth and tight. like a bathing cap of pale, polished metal. She walked to the window and stood looking out over the city. She asked without turning: \"What did you want to tell me?\" Alvah Scarret watched. her pleasurably. He had long since given up any attempts beyond holding her hand when not neces- sary or patting her shoulder; he had stopped thinking of the sub- ject, but he had a dim, half -conscious feeling which lte summed up to himself in the words: You never can tell. \"I've got good news for you, child,\" he said. ''I've. been work- ing out a little scheme, just a bit of reorganization, and I've fig- ured where I'll consolidate a few things together into a Women's Welfare Department. You know, the schools, the home econom- ics, the care of babies, the juvenile delinquents and all the rest of it-all to be under one head. And I see no better woman. for the job than my little girl.\" \"Do you mean me?\" she asked, without turning. \"No one else but. Just as soon as Gail comes back, I'll get his okay.\" She turned and looked at him, her arms crossed, her hands holding her elbows. She said: ''Thank you, Alvah. But I don't want it.\" \"What do you mean, you don't want it?\" ''I mean that I don't want it.\" ''For heaven's sake, do you realize what an advance that would be?'' \"Toward what?\" ''Your career.\" \"I never said I ·was planning a career.\" \"But you don't want to be running a dinky back-page column forever!\" · \"Not forever. Until I get bored with it.\" \"But think of what you could do in the real game! Think of what Gail could do for you once you come to his attention!\" \"I have no desire to come to his attention.\" \"But. Dominique, we need you. The women will be for you solid after tonight.\" \"I don't think so.\" 141"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"\"Why, I've ordered two columns held for a yarn on the meeting and your speech.\" She reached for the telephone and handed the receiver to him.

He said nothing, but clasped· his fore- head once.

Later, on a . bench in front of 1he garage whet'!' he. worked, Jimmy Gowan. explained in detail. He added: \"And how·I hap- pened to think of you.

People voiced indignant objec- tions to his choice of arehitect; Jimmy uttered .no word of expla- nation or self-defense;.he said politely: ''Maybe so, fOlks, maybe so,'' and Proceeded to have Roark-build his station. The station opened on a day in late Dece~ber. It stood on the edge of the aoston Post Road, two $D18ll structures of glass and concrete forming .a semicircle among the .trees: the cylinder of th~ office. and !he long. low oval of the diner, with the gasoline pumps as the colonnade of a forecourt between them ..

He drank coffee in a clean, white mug, at the counter of the diner, and he _ watched the cars stopping at the' door. He left late at night. He _ looked back once, driving down the long, empty road. The lights of the station winked, flowing away from. him. There it stood, at the crossing of two roads, and cars would be streaming past it day and night, cars coming from cities in which tltere was no room for buildings such as this, going to cities in which there would be no buildings such as this. He turned his face to the road before him, and he kept his eyes off the mirror which still held, glittering softly, dots of light that moved away far- behind him .... He drove back to months of idleness. He sat in his office each morning, because he knew that he had to sit there, looking at a door that never opened, his fingers forgotten on a telephone that never rang. _The ash· trays he emptied each day, before leaving, contained nothing but the stubs of his own cigarettes. \"What are you doing about it, Howard?''

At five o'clock, he walked home. He had moved to a better room, near the office; he spent little; he had enough money for a long time · to come. On a morning in February the telephone rang in his office. A brisk,. emphatic feminine- voice asked for an appointment with Mr. Roark, the architect. That afternoon, a brisk, small, dark- skinned woman entered the office; she wore a mink coat and ex- otic earrings that tinkled when she moved her head. She moved her head a great deal, in sharp little birdlike jerks. She was Mrs. Wayne Wilmot of Long Island and she wished to build a country . house. She had selected Mr. Roark to build it, she explained, be- cause he had designed the home of Austen Heller.- She adored Austen Heller; he was, she stated, an oracle to all those pre- tending just the tiniest bit to the title of progressive intellectual, she thought-\"don't you?\"-and -she followed Heller like a zealot, \"yes, literally, like a zealot.\" Mr. Roark was very young, wasn't he?-but she diiln't mind that, she was very liberal and glad to help youth. She wanted a large house, she had two chil- dren, she believed in expressing their individuality-'\"don't you?''-and each had to have a separate nursery, she had to have a libtary-\"I read. to distraction\"-a music room, a conservatory-\"we ~w lilies-of-the-valley, my friends tell me it's my flower''-a den for her husband, who trusted her implic- itly and let her plan the house-\"because I'm so good at it, if I weren't a woman I'm sure I'd be an architect\"-servants' rooms and all that, 'and a three-car garage. After an hour and a half of details ~and explanations, she said: \"And of course, as to the style of the house, it will be English Thdor.: I adore English Thdor.\" He rooked at her. He asked slowly: \"Have _you seen Austen Heller's ·house?\" \"No, though I did want to see it, but how could 1?:-I've· never met Mr. Heller, I'm only his fan, just that, a plain; ordinary fan, what is he like in person?-you must leU me, I'm dying to hear it-no, I haven't seen his house, it's somewhere up in Maine, isn't it?\" Roark took photographs out of the desk drawer and handed them to· her. · \"This,\" he said, \"is the Heller house.\" She-looked at the photographs, her glanc_e like water skimming off their glossy surfaces, and threw them .down on the desk. \"Very interesting,\" she said. \"Most unusual. Quite stunning. But, of course, that's not what I want. That kind of a house wouldn't express my personality.

He knew, wliile he spoke, that it was U$eless, beCause his words sounded as if they were hitting a vacuum. There Wit$ no such person as Mrs. Wayne Wdmot; there was only a shell containing lhe opinions of her friends; the picture post cards she had seen, the novels of country squires she had read; it was this that be had to address, this im- niareriality which could not hear him ot answer, deaf and imper- sonal like a wad of cotton. · ''I'm sorry,\" said Mrs. Wayne Wilmot, ''but rm not' accustomed to dealing With a person utterly ilicapable of reason. l'lri quire sure I shall find plenty of bigger men who'll be glad to work for me.

The first thing Keating felt was relief to see that the body had followed the head and lay crumpled in a heap on the floor, intact. There had been no sound; only the mufiled, musical bursting of porcelain. He'll be furious, thought Keating, looking down at the cups. He had jumped to his feet, he was kneeling, gathering the pieces pointlessly; he saw that they . were broken beyond repair. He knew he was tbinking also, at the same time, that it had come, that second stroke they had been expecting, and that be would have to do something about it in. a moment, but that it was all right, because Heyer would have to. retire now. · Then he moved on ·his knees closer to Heyer's body. He won- dered why he· did not want to touch it. \"Mr. Heyer,\" he called. His voice was soft, almost respectful. He lifted Hey!;ll\"'s head, . cautiously. He let it drop. He heard no sound. of its falling. He heard the hiccough in his own throat. Heyer was dead. He sat beside the body, his buttocks against his heels, his bands spread on his knees. He looked straight ahead; his glance stopped on the foldscof the hangings by the door; he wondered whether the gray sheen was dust or the nap of velvet and. was it velvet and how old-fashioned it was to have hangings by a door. Then be felt himself shaking. He wanted to vomit. He rose, walked_ across the room and threw the door open, because.he re- membered that there was the rest of the apartment somewhere and a valet in it, and he called, trying to scream for help. Keating came to the office as usual. He answered questions, he explained that Heyer had askec;l him, that day, to come to his house after dinner; Heyer had wanted to discuss the matter of his retirement. No one doubted the story and Keating knew that no one ever would. Heyer's end had come as everybody had ex- pected it to come. Francon felt nothin_g but relief. ''We knew he would, sooner or later,\" said Francon. ''Why regret that he spared himself and all of us a prolonged agony?\" . Keating's manner was calmer than it had been for weeks. It was the calm of blank stupor. The thought followed him, gentle, unstressed, monotonous, at his work, at home, at night: he was a murderer . . . no, but almost a murderer . . . almost a murderer ... He knew that it had not been an accident; he knew - . he had counted on the shock and• the terror; he had counted on that second stroke which would send Heyer to the hospital for 135"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"· the rest of his days. Bqt was that all he had expected?. Hadn't he known what elSe a second strol!;e oould mean? Had he counted on that? He tried to remember. He tried, wringing his mind dry. He felt nothing. He expected to feel nothing, one way or another. Only he wanted to· know. He did not notice what · went on in the office around him. He forgot that he had but a short time left to close the deal with Francon about the partner- ship. - . . A few days after Heyer's death Francon called him to his (!ffice. \"Sit down, Peter,\" he said with a: brighter smile than usual. \"Well, I have some good news for you, kid. They read Lucius's ·will this morning. He had no. relatives left, you know. Well, I was surprised, I didn't giye him ·enough credit, I guess, but it seems he.could make a nice gesture on occasion. He's left everything to you.:. • Pretty grand, isn't it? Now you won't have to worry abaut iriveStinent when we make arrangements for ... What's the matter, Peter? ... Peter, my boy, are y_ou sick?''. . Keating's face fell upon his arm on the comer ofthe desk: He could not let Fr~ptcon see his face~ He was going to be sick; sick 1 beeause through the horror, he had caught himself wondering how much Heyer had actually left .... The. will had- been made out five years ago; perhaps in a sense- less spurt ofaffectiori for the only person who had shown Heyer consideration in the office; perhajls as a gesture against his part- ner; it had been made and forgotten. The estate ainounted to two · hundred thousand dollars, plus Heyer's interest in the firm.and his porcelain collection. - Keating left the office early, that day, not hearing the congrat- ulatioll$. He went home, told the news to his mother, left her gasping in the middle of the living room, and lacked himself in his bedroom. He went out, saying nothing, before dinner. He had no dinner that night, but he drank blmself into a ferocious lucid- ity, at his favorite speak-easy. And in that heightened state oflu- minous vision; his head noddipg over a glass but his mind steady, he told hiiilself that he had nothing to regtet; he had done what anyone would have done; CaUterine had said it, he was selfish; . · everybody was selfish; it was. not a pretty thing, to be selfislt, but he was notak>ne.in it; he had merely been luckier than most; he had beell, because he was ·better than most; he felt fine; he ·hoped the Useless questioils would never come back to him again; every man for himself, he muttered, falling asleep on the table. The useless-questions never came back to him again. He had no time for them in the days .that followed. He had won the Cosmo-Slotnick competition. · Peter Keating had known it would be a ·triumph, but he had not expected the thing that happeded. He had dreamed of a sound of . trumpets; he had not foreseen a symphonic explosion. 186"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"•<..

The telephone rang late ·on Monday afternoon._ ''Mr. Roark?\" said Weidler. \"Can you c6me right over?

There was a long conference table in -the room, and Roark's drawings were spread upon it Weidler rose when he en- tered and walked to meet him, his' band outstretched. It was in the air of the room, like an overture to the words Weidler uttered, and · 194"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Roark .was not certain of the moment when he heard them, because he thought he had heard them the instant he entered. \"Well, Mr. Roark, the commission's yours,\" said Weidler. Roark bowed. It was best not to trust his voice for a few min- utes. The chairman smiled amiably, inviting him to sit down. Roark sat down by the side of the table that supported his drawings. His hand rested on the table. The polished mahogany felt warm and living under his fingers; it was almost as if he were pressing his hand against the foundations of JUs building; his greatest build- ing; fifty stories to rise in the center of Manhattan. . \"I must tell you,\" the chairman was saying, ''that we've had a· hell of a fight over that building of yours. Thimk God it's over. Some of our members just couldn't swallow your radical innova- tions. You know how stupidly conservative some people are: But we've found a way to please them, and we got their consent. Mr. Weidler here was really magnificently convincing on your be- half.\". A great deal more was said by the three men. Roark ba{ely heard it. He was thinking of the first bite of machine into earth thaf begins an excavation. l'hen he heard the chairman saying: \". . . and so it's yours, on one minor condi9<>n.\" He heard that and looked at the chairman. \"It's a small compromise, and when you agree to it we can sign the contract. It's only an inconsequential matter of the build- ing's appearance. I understand that you modernists attach no great importance to a mere fa~e. it's the plan that counts with you, quite rightly, and we wouldn't think of altering your plan in any way, it's the logic of the plan that sold us on the building. So I'ni sure you won't miild.\" ''What do you wantT' \"It's only a matter of a slight alteration in t)le fa~ade. I'll show you. Our Mr. Parker's son is studying architeCture and_ we had him draw us up a sketch, just a rough sketch to illustrate what we had in mind and to show the members of the board, because they couldn't have visualized the compromise we offered: Here it is.\" He pulled a sketch from under the drawings on the table and handed it to Roark. It was Roark's building -on the sketch, very neatly drawn. It was his building, but it had a simplified Doric portico in front, a cornice on tc:lp, and his . ornament was replaced by a stylized Greek ornament. Roark got up. He had to stand. He concentrated on the effort of standing. It made the rest easier. He leaned on one straight arm, his hand closed over the edge of the table, the tendons · showing under the skin of his wrist. · · \"You see the pointT' said the chairman soothingly. \"Our con- servatives sunply refu!led to accept a queer stark building like 195"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"yours, And they claim that the public won't accepi it t~i~er. So we hit upon the middle course. In this way, though it's not tradi- tional architecture of c;oilrse, it will gi'!e the public the impres- sion of what they're accustomed to. It adds a certain air of sound, stable dignity-and that's what we want in a bank, isn't it? It does seem to be an unwritten law that a bank must have a Classic portico-,.-and a bank is not exactly the right institution to parade law-breaking and rebellion. Undermines that intangible feeling of confidence, you know. People don't trust novelty. But this is the scheme that pleased everybody. Personally, I wouldn't insist on it, but I really don't see that it 'spoils anything. And _that's what the board has decided. Of course, we don't mean that we want you to follow this sketch. But it gives you our general idea and you'll work it out yourself, make your own adaptation of the Classic motive to the fa~de.\" · Then. Roark answered. The men could not classify the tone of his voice; they could not decide whether it was too great a calm or too great an emotion. They concluded that it was calm, be- cause the voice moved forward evenly, without stress, without color, each syllable spaced as by a machine; only the air in the room was not the air that vibrates to a calm voice. They concluded that there was nothing abnormal in the manner of the man who was speaking, except the fact that his right hand would not leave the edge of the table, and when he had to move · the drawings, he did it With his left hand, like a man with one arm paralyzed. · . He spoke for a long time. He exjilained why this structure could not have a Oassic motive on its fa~ade. He explained why an honest building, like an honest man, had to be of one piece and orie faith; what constituted the life so1lrce, the idea in any ex- isting thing or creature, and why-if one smallest part committed treason to that idea-the thing of the creature was dead; and why the good; the high and the noble on earth was only that which kept its integrity. , The chairman interrupted him: \"Mr. Roark, I agree. with you. There's no answer to what you're saying. But uufortunately, in practical life, one can't al- ways be so flawlessly consistent. ·There's always the incalcnlable human element of emotion. We can't fight that with cold logic. This discussion is actually superfluous. I can agree with you, but I can't help you. The matter is closed. It was the board's final decision-after more than usually prolonged consideration, as you know.\" . \"Will you let me appear before the board and speak to-them?\" \"I'm sorry, Mr. Ro~k. but the board will not re-open the ques- tion for further debate. It was final. I can only ask you to state · whether you agree to accept the commission on our terms or not.

Prescott, has been mentioned most favorably as an alternative. But I told the board that I felt ~rtain 'YOU would accept.\" He waited. Roark said nothing. \"You understand the situation, Mr. Roark?\" \"Yes,\" said Roark. His eyes were lowered. l:le was looking down at the drawings. \"Well?\" Roark did not answer. \"Yes or no, Mr. Roark?\" Roark's head. leaned back. He closed his eyes. \"No,\" said Roark. . After a while the chairman asked: \"Do you realize what you're doing?\" \"Quite,\" said Roark. \"Good God!\" Weidler cried suddenly .. \"Don't you laiow how big a commission this is? You're a young man, you won'tgetan- other chance like this. And . . . all right, damn it, I'll say it! You need this! I know how badly you need it!\" . Roark gathered the drawings from the table, rolled them to- gether ·and put them 'under his arm. \"It's sheer insanity!\" Weidler moaned. \"I warit you. We want your building. You need the commission. Do .you have ta be quite so fanatical and selfless about it?\" \"What?'' Roark asked incredulously. \"Fanatical and selftess.\" . Roark smiled. He looked down at his draWings. His elbow moved a little, pressing them to his-body. He said: · \"That was the most selfish thing you've ever seen a man do.\" He walked back to his office. He gathered. his drawing instru- ments and the few things he had there. It made one package and he carried it under his arm. He locked the door and gave the key to the rental agent. He told the agent that he was closi~g his of- fice. He walked home and left the package there. Then he went to Mike Donnigan's house.

But in a trash bas- ket on a comer a crumpled sheet of newspaper was rustling, beat- ing convulsively against the wire mesh. It made the wind real. In the evening, two days later, Roark left for Connecticut. From the train, he looked back once at the skyline of the city as it flash~ into sight and was held for some mom.ents beyond the windows. The twilight bad washed off the details of the buildings. They rose in thin shafts of a soft, porcelain blue, a color not of real things, but of evening and distance. They rose in bare outlines, like empty molds waiting to be filled. The ais- tance bad flattened the city. The single shafts· stood immeasur- ·ably tall, out of scale to the rest of the earth. They were of their own world, and they held up to the sky the statement of what man bad. conceived and made .possible. They were empty molds. But man had come so far; be could go farther.

Then the train swerved ,around a bend ad the city vanished. · That evening, in the banquet hall of the Star Roof Restaurant, a dinner !'as held to celebrate the admittance of Peter Keating to partnership in the firm to be known l:lenceforward as Francon & Keating. At the long table that seemed covered, not with a tablecloth, but with a sheet of light, sat Guy Francon. Somehow, tonight, he did not mind the streaks of silver that appeared on his temples; ~ sparkled crisply against the black of his hair and they gave . him an air of cleanliness and elegance, like the rigid white of hiS shirt against his black evening clothes. In the place of honor sat Peter Keating. He leaned back, his shoulders straight, his hand cloSed about the stem of a glass. His black curls glistened against his white forehead; In that one moment of silence, the guests felt no envy, no resentment, no malice. There was a grave feeling of brotherhood in the room, in the presence of the pale, handsome boy who looked solemn as at his first COIJI.Dlunion. Ralston Holcombe had risen to speak. He stood, his glass in hand. He had prepared his· speech, but he was astonished to hear himself saying something quite different, in a voice of complete sincerity. He said: . \"We are the guardians of a great human function. Perhaps of the greatest function among the endeavors of man. We have achieved. mucb and we have erred often. But we.are willing in all humility to make way for our heirs. We are only me~ and we are only seekers .. But we seek for truth with the best there is in our hearts.

The earth of the woods he- crossed was soft and warm under his feet; it was strange, after a day spent on the granite ridges; he smiled as at a new pleasure, each evening, and looked down to watch his feet crushing a sur- face that responded, gave way and conceded faint prints to be left behind.. . . There was a bathroom in the garret of the house where he roomed; the paint had peeled off the floor long ago an~ the naked boards were gray-white. He lay in the tub for a long time and let the cool water soak the stone dust out of his skin. He let his head hang back, on the edge of the tub, his eyes closed. The greatness of the weariness was its own relief: it iillowed no sensation but the slow pleasure of the tension leaving his musCles. He ate his dinner in a kitchen, with other quarry workers. He sat alone at a table in a.comer; the fumes of the grease, crackling eternally on the vast gas range, hid the rest of the room in a sticky haze. He ate little'. He d(ank a great deal of water; the cold, glittering liquid in a clean· glass was intoxicating.· He slept in a small wooden cube under the roof. The boards of the ceiling slanted down over his bed. When it rained, he could hear the burst of each drop against the roof, and it .took an effort to realize why he .did not feel the rain beating against his body. Sometimes, after dinner, he would walk into the woods that began behind the house. He would stretch down· on the ground, on his stomach, his elbows planted before him, his hands prop- ping his chin, and he would watch the patterns of. veins on the green blades of grass under his face; he wou~d &low at them and watch the blades tremble then stop again. He would roll over on his back and lie .still, feeling the warmth of .the earth under him. Far above, the leaves were still green, but it was a thick, com- pressed green, as if the· color were condensed in one last effort before the dusk coming to dissolve it. The leaves hung without motion against a sky of polished lemon yellow; its luminous pal- lor emphasized that its light was failing, He pressed his hips, his back into the earth under him; the earth resisted, but it gave way; it was a silent victory; he felt a dim, sensuous pleasure in the muscles· of his legs. · Sometimes, not often, he sat up and did not move ·for a long time; then he. smiled, the slow smile of an executioner watching a victim. He thought of his days going by, of the buildings he could have been doing, should have been doing and, perhaps, never would be doing again. He watched the pain's unsummoned appearance with a cold, detached curiosity; he said to. himself: . Well, here it is again. ·He waited to see how long it would last. It gave him a strange, hard pleasure to watch his fight against it, and he could forget that it was his own suffering; he could smile in contempt, not realizing that he smiled at his own agony. Such 202"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"moments were rare. But when they came, he felt as he did in the quarry:· that he had to drill through granite. that he had to drive a wedge and blast the thing within him whic..il persisted in calling to his pity. Dominique Francon lived alone, that summer, in the great Co- lonial mansion of her father's estate, three miles beyond the quarry town. She received no visitors. An old caretaker and his wife were the only human beings she saw, not too often and . merely of necessity; they lived some distance from the mansion,_ near the stables;- the caretaker attended to the gro1lllds and the horses;. his wife attended to the house and cooked Dominique's meals. · The meals were served with the gracious severity the old woman had learned' in .the days when Dominique's mother lived lind presided over the guests in that great dining room. At night DQminiq~e foun'd her solitary place at the·table laid out as for a formal banquet, the candles lighted, the tongues of yellow flame standing motionless like the shining metal Speal'll of a guard of honor. The darkness stretched the room into a ~1, tbe big. win~ dows rose like a flat colonnade of sentinels. A shallow crystal bowl stood in a pOOl of light in the center of the long table, with a single water lily spreading white petals about a heart yellow like a drop of candle fire. · The old woman served the meal in unobtrusive silence, an~ disappeared from the house. as soon as she could afterward. When Dominique walked up the staks to tier bedroom, she found the fragile lace folds of her nightgown laid out on the bed. In the morning she entered her bathroom and fll·m~ water in the sunken bathtub,· the- hyacinth odor of her bath wts,. the aquamarine tiles polished, shining' under her feet, her huge towels spread out like snowdrifts to swallow her body-yet she heard no steps and felt - no livin~ presence in· the house. The old woman's treatment of Dominique had .the s~e reverent caution with which she han- dled the pieces .of Venetian glass in the drawing-room cabinets. Dominique had spent sp many summers and winters, surround- . ing herself with. people in order to feel alone, that the experiment of actual solitude was an encbantment to' her and a betrayal into a weakness she had never allowed herself: the. weakness of en- joying it. She stretche<t her arms and 'let them drop lazily, feeling - a sweet, drowsy heaviness above her elbows, as . after a first drink. She was conscious of her summer dresses, she felt her knees, her • thighs encountering the faint resistance· of cloth when she moved, and it made her conscious not of the cloth, but of her knees and thighs, The house stood alone amidst vast grounds, and the woods stretched beyond; there. were no neighbors for miles. She rode on .horseback down long, deserted roads, down· hidden paths leading 203."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"nowhere;. Leaves glittered. in the sun .and twigs snapPed in th.e wind of her flying passage.

Sometimes she started on foot from the bouse and walked for miles, setting herself no goal and no hour of return. Cars passed her on the road; the people of the quarry town knew her and bowed to her; sbe was considered the chatelaine of the country- side, as her mother .had been long ago. She turned off the road into the woods and walked on, her arms swinging loosely, her head thrown back, watching the tree tops. She saw clouds swim- ming behind the leaves; it looked .as if a giant tree before her were moving, slanting, ready to fall and and crush her; . she stopped; she waited, her head thrown back, her throat pulled tight; she felt as if she wanted to be crushed~ Then she shrugged and went on. She flung thick branches impatiently out of her way and let them scratch her bare arms. She walked on long after she was exhausted, she drove herself forward ag~st the weariness of her muscles. Then she fell down on her back and lay still, her arms and legs flung out like a cross on the ground, breathing in release, feeling empty and flattened, feeling the weight of the air like a pressure against her breasts. . · Some mornings, when she awakened in her bedroom, ·she beard the explosions of blasting at the granite quarry.

She saw one strand of red hair that fell over his face and swayed with the trembling of the drill. She thought-hopefully- that the vibrations of the drill hurt him, hurt his body, everything inside his body. When she was on the rocks above him, he raised his head and looked at her; she had not caught him noticing her approach; he looked up as if he expected her to be there, as if he knew she would be back. She saw the hint of a smile, more insulqng than words. He sustained the insolence of looking straight at her, he would not move, he would not grant the concession of turning away-of acknowledging that he had no right to look at. her in such manner. He had not merely taken that right, he was saying silently- that she had given it to him. . She turned 'sharply and walked on, down the rocky slope, away from the quarry. It was not his eyes, not his mouth that she remembered, but his hands. The ·meaning of that day seemed held in a sipgle picture she had noted: the simple instant of his one hand resting against granite. She saw it ·again: hiS fingertips pressed to the stone, his long fingers continuing the straight lines of the tendons that spread in a fan from his wrist to his knuckles. She thought of him, but the vision present through all her thoughts was the pic- ture of that hand on the granite. It frightened her; she could not understand it. . · He's 'only a common worker, she thought, a _hired man doing a convict's labor. She thought of that, sitting before' the glass shelf of her dressing table. She looked at the crystal objects spread before her; they were like sculptures in ice-they pro- claimed her own cold, -luxUrious fragility; and she thought of his strained body, of his clothes drenched in dust and sweat, of his hands. She ,stressed the contrast, because it degraded her. She· leaned back; closing her' eyes. She thought of the many distin- guished men whom she had refused. She· thought of the quarry worker. She thought of being broken-not by a man she admired, but by a man she loathed. She let her head fall down on her arm; the thought left her weak with pleasure. · For two. days she made herself believe that she would escape from this place; she found old travel folders in her trunk, studied them, chose the resort, the hotel and the particular room in· that hotel, selected the trairi she- would take, the boat and the ·number of the stateroom.

The sound became motion, a jolt running down her throat to her stomach. It flung her up, she stood awkwardly, bent over, her forearms pressed to her stomach. She heard the small table by the bed rattling in the darkness, and she looked at it, in empty astonishment that a table should move without reason. Then she understood that she was shaking. She was not frightened; it seemed foolish to shake like that, in shdrt, separate jerks, like soundless hiccoughs. She thought she must take a bath. The need was unbearable, as if she had felt it for a long time. Nothing mat- tered, if only she would take a bath. She dragged her feet slowly to the door of her bathroom. She turned the light on in the bathroom. She saw herself in a tall mirror. She saw the purple bruises left on her body by his mouth. She heard a moan muffled in her throat, not very loud. It was not the sight, but the sudden flash of knowledge. She knew that she would not take a bath. She knew that she wanted to keep 217"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":".the feeling of his· body, the ttaces of his body on hers, knowing also what such a desire implied. She fell on her knees, clasping the edge of. the bathtub. She could not make herself crawl over that edge. Her bands slipped. she lay still on the floor. The tiles were hard and cold under her body. She lay there till. morning. Roark awakened in the morning and thought that last night had been like a point reached, like a stop in the movement of his life. He was moving forward for the sake of such stops; like the mo- ments when he had walked through the half-finished Heller hou8e; like last nig)lt. In some unstated way, last night had been what building was to him; in soine quality of reaction within him, in what it gave to his consciousness of existence. They had been united in an understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deh'berate obscenity of his action; had she meant leSs to him, he woUld not have takeD her as he did; had he meant less to her, She. would not have fought sa desperately. The unrepeatable ex- ultation was· in knowing that they· both understood this. He went to the quarry and he worked that day as usual. She did not come .to the quarry and he did not expect her to come. But the thought of her remained. He· watched it with curiosity. It was strange to be conscious of another person's existence, to feel it as a close, urgent necessity; a necessity without qualifications, neither pleasant nor . painful, merely final like an ultimatum. It was importal)t to know that she existed in the world; it was im- portant to think of her, of how she had awakened this morning, of how she moved, with ·her body still his, now his forever, of what she thought. That evening, at dinner in the sooted kitchen, he opened a newspaper and saw the name of Roger Enright in the lines of a gossip column. He read the short paragraph: \"It looks like another grand project on its way to the wastebas- ket.. Roger Enright, ~e oil.king, seems to be stumped this time. He'll have to call a halt to his latest pipe dream of an Enright House. Architect trouble, we are told. Seems as if half a dozen of the big building boys have .been shown the gate by the unsatisfi- able Mr. Enright. Top-notchers, all of them.\" Roark felt the wrench he had tried so often to fight, not to let it hurt him too much: -the wrench of helplessness before the vi- sion of· what he could do, what should have been possible and was closed to him. Then, without reason, he thought of Domi- nique Francon. She had no relation to the things in .his mind; he was shocked only to know· that she could remain present even among these things. A week passed. Then, one· evening, he found a letter waitiug for him at home: It had· been forwarded from his former office to his last New York address, from there to Mike, from Mike to 218"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Connecticut. The engraved address of an oil company on the en- velope meant nothing to him. He opened the letter. He read: \"Dear Mr. Roark, \"I have been endeavoring for some time to get in touch with you, but have been unable to locate you. Please communicate with me at your earliest convenience. I should like to discuss with you my proposed Enright House, if you are the man who built the Fargo Store .. \"Sincerely yours, \"Roger Enright.\" Half an hour later Roark was on a train. When the train started moving, he remembered Dominique and that he was leaving her behind. The thought seemed distant and unimportant. He was as- tonished only to know that he still thought of her, even now. She could accept, thought Dominique, and come to forget in time everything that had happened to her, save one memory: that she had found pleasure in the thing which had happened, that he had known it, and more: that he had known it before he came to her and that he would not have come but for that knowledge;·She had not given him the one answer that would have saved her: an answer of simple revulsion-she had found joy in her revulsion, in her terror and in his strength. That was the degradation she had wanted and she hated him for it. She found a letter one morning, waiting for .her on the break- fast table. It was from Alvah Scarre~. \" ... When are you coming back, Dominique? I can't tell you how much we miss you here. You're not a comfortable person to have around, I'm actually scared ·of you, but I might as well inflate your inflated ego some more, at a distance, and confess that we're all waiting for you impatiently. It will be like the hOmecoming of an Empress.\" She read it and smiled. She thought, if they knew ... those people . . . that old life and that awed reverence before her person ... I've been raped · ... I've been raped by some red- headed hoodlum from a stone quarry. . . . I, Dominique Franeon .... Through the fierce sense of humiliation, the words gave bet the same kind of pleasure she had felt in his arms. She thought of it when she walked through the countryside, when she passed people on the road and the people bowed to her, the chatelaine of the town. Sh~ ·wanted to scream it to the hearing of all. She was not conscious of the days that passed. She felt content in a strange detachment, alone with the words she kept repeating to herself. Then, one morning, standing on the lawn in her gar- den, she understood that a week had passed and that she had not 219"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"·seen him for a week.

The door flew for- ward as if it had opened of itself to· the approach of a man before whom all doors were to open in such manner.· His day in the office began with the newspapers. There was a neat pile of them waiting, stacked on his desk by his secretary. He liked to see what new mentions appeared in print about the progress of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building or the ftrm of Francon & Keating. There were no mentions in the papers this morning, and Keating frowned. He saw, however, a story about Ellsworth M. Toohey. It was a startling story. Thomas L. Foster, noted philan- thropist, had died and had left, among .larger bequests; the modest sum of one hundred thousand dollars to Ellsworth M. Toohey, \"my friend and spiritual guide-in appreciation . of his· noble mind and true devotion to humanity.\" Ellsworth M. Toohey had accepted the legacy and had turned it over, intact, 'to the ''Work- shop of Social Study,\" a progressive institute of learning where he held the post of lecturer on \"Art as a Social Symptom.\" He had given the simple explanation that he \"did not believe in the institution of private inheritance.\" He had refused all further comment. \"No, my friends,\" he had said, ''not about this.\" And had added, with his charmin~ knack for destroying the earnest- ness of his own moment: \"I like to indulge in the luxqry of com- menting solely upon interesting subjects. I do not consider myself one of these.\" Peter Keating read the story. And because he knew that it was an action which he would never have committed, he admired it tremendously. Then he thought, with a familiar twinge of annoyance, that he had not been able to meet Ellsworth Toohey. Toohey had left on a lee~ tour shortly after the award in the Cosmo-Slotnick com- petition, and the brilliant gatherings Keating had attended ever since were made empty by the absence of the one man he'd been most eager to meet. No mention of Keating's name had appeared . in Toohey's column. Keating turned hopefully, as he did each morning, to \"Oite Small Voice\" in the Banner. But \"One Small Voi~e\" was subtitled \"Songs and Things\" today, and was devoted to proving the superiority of folk songs over any other forms of 221"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"musical art, and of choral singing over any other manner of mu- sical rendition. Keating dropped the Banner. He got up and paced viciously across the office, because he had to tum now to a disturbing problem, He had been postponing it for several mornings. It was the matter of choosing a sculptor for the Cosmo-Slotn.ck Build- ing. Months ago the commission for the giant statue of \"Indus- try\" to stand in the main lobby of the building had been awarded-tentatively-to SteVen Mallory. The award had puz- zled Keating; but it had been made by Mr. Slotnick, so Keating had approved of it. He had interviewed Mallory and said: \" ... in recognition of_ your unusual ability . . . of course you have no name, but you Will have, after a commission like this .. ; they don't come every day like this building of mine.\" , He had not liked Mallory. Mallory's eyes were like black holes left after a fire not quite put out, and Mallory had not smiled once. He was twenty-four years old, had had one show of his work, but not many commissions. His work was strange and too violent. Keating remembered that Ellsworth Toohey had said once, long ago, in \"One Small Voice.\" \"Mr. Mallory's human figures would have been very fine were it not for the hypothesis that God created the world and the human form. Had Mr. Mallory been entrusted with the job, he might, perhaps, have done better than the Almighty, if we are to judge by what he . passes as human bodies in stone. Or would be?\" Keating had been_ baffled by Mr. Slotnick's choice, until he heard that Dimples Williams had once lived in the same Green- wich Village tenement with Steven Mallory, and Mr. Slotnick could refuse nothing to Dimples Williams at the moment. Mallory had been hired, had worked and had submitted a model of his statue of ... Industry.\" When he saw it, Keating knew that the statue would look like a raw gash, like a smear of fire in the neat eleg~ce of his lobby. It was a slender naked body of a man who looked as if he could break through the steel plate of a bat- tleship and through any barrier whatever. It stood like a chal- lenge. It left a strange stamp on one's eyes. It made the people around it seem smaller and sadder than usual. For the first time in his life, looking at that statue, Keating thought he understood what was meant by the word \"heroic.\" He said nothing. But the model was sent on to Mr. Slotnick and many people said, with indignation, what Keating had felt. Mr. Slotnick ·asked him to select another sculptor and left the choice in his hands. Keating flopped down in an armchair, leaned back and clicked his tongue against his palate. He wondered whether he should give the commission to Bronson, the sculptor who was a friend of Mrs. Shupe, wife of the president of Cosmo; or to Palmer, who had been recommended by Mr. Huseby who was planning 222"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"the erection · Qf a ne:w five-million-dollar cosmetic factory. Keating· discovered that he liked this process of hesitation; he held the fate of two men and of many potential others; their fate, their work, their hope, perhaps even the amount of food in their stomachs. He could choose as he pleased, for any reason, without reasons; he could ftip a eoin, he could count them off on the but- tons of his vest. He.was a great man-by the grace ofthose who depended on him. · · Then he noticed the envelope. · it -lay on top of a pile of letterS on his desk. It was a plain,. thin, narrow envelope, but it bore the small masthead of the Ban- ner in one comer: He reached for it hastily. It contained no letter; only a strip of proofs for tomolT()w's Banner. He saw the familiar \"One Small Voice\" by Ellsworth M. Toohey, and under it a single word as subtitle, in large, spaced letters, a single word, blatant in its singleness, a salute by dfut of omission: \"KEATING\" He dropped the paper strip and seized it agaiti and read, chok- ing upon great unchewed.hunks of sentences, the paper trembling in .his hand, the skin on his forehead drawing into tight pink spots. Toohey had written: \"Greatness is an exaggeration, and like all eXaggerations of dimension it connotes at once the necessary corollary of emptiness. One thinks of an inflated toy balloon, does one not? There are, however' 9CC8Sions when we are forced to acknowledge the promise of an approach-brilliantly close-to what we designate loosely by the term of great- ness. Such a promise is looming on our architectural horizon in the pmon of a. mere bOy named Peter Keating. \"We have heard a great deaJ....:and with justice-about the superb Cosma-Slotnick -Building which he has designed.

And if Pete Keating should chance to read these lines, we expect no gratitude from him. The grat- itude is ours.\" · It was when Keating began to read the article for the third time that he noticed a f~w lines written in red pencil across the space by its title: . \"Dear Peter Keating, \"Drop in to see me at my office one of these days. Would love to discover wliat you look like. \"E.M.T.\" He let the clippi11g flutter down to his desk, and he stood over it; running a strand of hair between his fingers, in a kind of happy stupor. Then he whirled around to ·his drawing of the Cosma-Slotnick Building, that hung on the wall between a huge photograph of the Parthenon and one of the Louvre. He looked at the pilasters of his building. He had never thought of them as . Culture flowering from out of the broad masses, but .he decided that one could very well think that and all the rest of the .beau- tiful stuff. ~en he seized the telephone, he spoke to a high, flat voice which belonged to Ellsworth Toohey's secretary. and he made an appointment to see Toohey at four-thirty -of the •next afternoon. In the hours that followed, his daily work ass~ed a new rel- ish. It was as if his usual activity had been only a bright, flat mu- ral an_d had now become a noble bas-relief, pushed forward, given a three-dimensional reality by the words of Ellsworth Toohey. Guy Francon descended from his office once in a while, for no ascertainable p1,1rpose. The subtler shades of his shirts and socks . matched the gray of his temples. He stood smiling benevolently in silence. Keating flashed past him in the drafting room and ac- 224"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"knowledged his presence, not stopping,. but slowing his steps long enough to plant a crackling bit of newspaper into the folds of the mauve handkerchief in Francon's breast-pocket, with \"Read that when you have time, Guy.\" He added, his steps half- way across the next room: \"Want to have lunch with me today, Guy? Wait for me at the Plaza.\" When he came back from lunch, Keating was stopped by a young draftsman who asked, his voice high with excitement:· \"Say, Mr. Keating, who's it took a shot at Ellsworth Toohey?'' Keating managed to gasp out: \"Who is it did what?\" \"Shot Mr. Toohey.\" \"Who?\" ''That's what I want to know, who.\" \"Shot •.. Ellsworth Toohey?\" \"That's what I saw in the paper in the restaurant a guy had. Didn't have time to get one.\" \"He's ... killed?'' \"That's what I don't know. Saw only it said about a shot.\" \"If h~'s dead, does that mean they won't publish his column tomorrow?'' \"Dunno. Why, Mr. Keating?\" \"Go get me a paper.\" \"But I've got to ... \" \"Get me that paper, you damned idiot!\" The story was there, in .the afternoon papers. A shot had been fired at Ellsworth Toohey that morning, as he stepped out of his car in front of a radio station where he was to deliver an address . on ''The Voiceless and the Undefended.\" The shot had ririssed him. Ellsworth Toohey had remained calm and sane throughout. His behavior had been theatrical only in too complete an absence of anything theatrical. He had said: \"We cannot keep a radio au- dience waiting,\" and had hurried on upstairs to the microphone where, never mentioning the incident, he delivered a half-hour's speech from memory, as he always did. The assailant had said nothing when arrested. · · Keating stared\"\"\"\"'-hls throat dry-at the name of the assailant. It was Steven Mallory. Only the inexplicaole frightened Keating, particularly when the inexplicable lay, not in tangible facts, but in that causeless feeling of dread within him. There was nothing to concern him directly in what had happened, except his wish that it had been someone else, anyone but Steven Mallory; and that he didn't know why he should wish this. Steven Mallory had remained silent. He had given no explana- tion of his act. At first', it was supposed that·he might have been prompted by despair at the loss of his commission for the Cosmo-Siotnick Building, since·it was learned that he lived in re- . 225"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"volting poverty. But it was learned, beyond any' doubt, that Ellsworth Toohey had had no conn~on whatever with. bis loss~ Toohey had neyer spoken to Mr. Slotnick about Steven MallOJY. Toohey had not seen the statue of ''Industry.\" On this point Mallory had broken his silence to admit that he had never met Toohey nor seen him in person before, nor known any of Toohey's friends. \"Do you think that Mr. Toohey was in some way responsible for your losing that commission'J\".IJe was asked. Mallory had answered: \"No.'; \"Then whr?'' Mallory said noth- ing. .. Toohey had not recognized his assailant when he saw him seiZed by· policemen on the sidewalk outside the radio station. He did not learn his name until a(ter the broadcast Then, stepping out of the studio into an anteroom full of waiting newsmen, ·Toohey said: \"No, of course I won't press any charges. I wish they'd let llim go. Who is he, by the way?'' When he heard the name; Toohey's glance remained fixed somewhere· between the shoulder of one man and ~e hat brim of another. Then Too~y­ who had stood calmly while a bullet .struck an.inch from bisface against the glass of the entrance door below-uttered one word and the word seemed to fall at bis feet, heavy with fear: \"Why?\" No one could answer. Presently, Toohey shrugged, smiled, and said: \"If it was an attempt at free publicity-well, what atrocious taste!\" But nobody believed this explanation, because all felt that Toohey. did not believe it either. Through the interviews that fol- lowed, Toohey answeted questions gaily. He said: ''I had never thought myself important enough to warrant assassination. It . would be the· greatest tribute one could possibly expect-if it weren't so much fu the style of an operetta.'' He ~ to con- vey the charming impression that nothing of i,mportance had hap- pened becaUse nothing of importance ever happened on ·earth. Mallory was sent to j~ to await trial. All .efforts to question ·him failed. The thogght that kept Keating uneasily awake foi many hours, that night, was· the groundless certainty that Toohey felt exactly as he did. He knows, thought Keating, and I know, that there is--in Steven Mallory's motive-a greater danger than in his murderous attempt But we shall never know bis motive. Or shall we? ... And then he touched the core of fear: it was the sudden wisbthat he~might be guarded, through the years to come, to the end of bis life, from ever .l~g that motive. 'Ellsworth Toohey's secretary rose in a leisurely manner, when Keating entered, and opened for him the door into Ellsworth Toohey's o~. Keating had grown past the stage of experiencing anxiety at the prospect of. meeting a famous man, but he experienced it in the moment when he saw the door. opening under her hand. He 226"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"wondered what Toohey really looked like. He remembered the magnificent voice he had heard in the lobby of the strike meeting, and he imagined a giant of a man, with a rich mane of hair, perhaps just turning gray, With bold, broad features of an in- effable benevolence, something vaguely like the countenance of God the Father. \"Mr. Peter Keating-Mr. Toohey,\" said the· secretary and closed the door behind him. At a first glance upon Ellsworth Monkton Toohey one wished to offer him a heavy, well-padded overcoat-so frail and unpro- tected did his thin little body appear, like that of a chicken just . emerging from the egg, in all the sorry fragility of unhardened bones. At a second glance one wished to be sure that the over- coat should be an exceedingly good one-so exquisite were the garments covering that body. The lines of the dark suit followed . frankly the shape within it, apologizing for nothing: they sank with the concavity of the narrow chest, they slid down from the long, thin ·neck with the sharp slope of the shoulders. A great forehead dominated the body. The wedge-shaped face descended from the broad temples ·to a small, pointed chin. The hair was black, lacquered, divided into equal halves by a thin white line. This made the skull look tight and trim, but left too much empha- sis to the ears that flared out in solitary nakedness, like the· han- dles of a bouillon cup. The nose was long and thin, prolonged by the small dab of a black mustache. The eyes were dark and star- · tling. They held suclra wealth ofintellect and of twinkling gaiety that his glasses seemed to be worn not to protect his eyes but to protect other men from their excessive brilliance. · \"Hello, Peter Keating,\".said Ellsworth Monkton Toohey in his compelling, magical voice. ''What do you think of the temple of Nike ApterosT' ''How ... do you do, Mr. Toohey,\" said Keating, stopped, stu- pefied. \"What do I think ... of what?\" ... · . \"Sit down, my friend. Of the temple of Nike Apteros.\" \"Well ... Well ... I ... \" \"I feel certain that you couldn't have overlooked that little gem. The Parthenon has usurped the recognition which-and isn't that usually the case? the bigger and stronger appropriating all the glory, while the beauty of the unprepossessing goes unsung-which should have been awarded to that magnificent little creation of the great free spirit of Greece. You've noted, I'm sure, the fine balance of its mass, the supreme perfection of its modest proportions-ah, yes, you know, the supreme in the modest-the delicate craftsmanship of detail?\" ''Yes, of course,\" muttered Keating, ''that's always been ·my favorite-the temple of Nike Apteros.\" \"Really?\" said Ellsworth Toohey, with a smile which Keating could not quite classify. \"I was certain of it. I was certain you'd 227"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"say it. You have a very handsome face, Peter Keating, when you don't stare like this-which is really quite unnecessary.\" And Toohey was laughing suddenly, laughing quite obviously, quite insultingly; at .Keating and at himself; it was as if he were underscoring· the falseness of the whole procedure. Keating sat aghast for an instant; and then he found himself laughing easily in answer, as if at home with a very old friend. '\"That's better,\" said Toohey. ''Don't you find it advisable not to talk too seriously in an important moment? And this might be a very important moment-who knows?-for both of us. And, of course, I knew you'd be a little afraid of. me an4-:-oh, I admit-1. was quite a bit afraid of you, so isn't this much better?\" \"Oh, yes, Mr. Toohey,\" said Keating happily. His normal aS- surance in meeting people had vanished; but he felt at ease, as if all responsibility were taken away from him and he did not have to worry about saying the right things, because he was being led gently into saying them wtthout any effort on his part. ''I've al- ways known it would .be an important moment when I met you, Mr. Toohey. Alway~,. For years.\" . \"ReallyT' said Ellsworth Toohey, the eyes behind the glasses attentive. ''Why?\" \"Because I'd always hoped that I would please you •. that you'd approve of me ... of my work ... when the time came ... why, Ieven.\" .. \" - \"Yes?\" . \". . . I even thought, so often, when drawing, is this the kind of building that Ellsworth Toohey would say is good? I tried to see it like that, through your eyes ... I •.. I've ... \" Toohey lis- tened watchfully. \"I've always wanted to meet you because you're such a profound thinker and a man of such cultural distinc--\" \"Now,\" said Toohey, his voice kindly but a little impatient; his interest had dropped on that last sentence. \"None of.that. I don't mean to be ungracious, but we'll dispense with that sort of thing, shall we? Unnatural as this may sound, I really don't like to hear personal praise.\" It was Toohey's eyes, thought Keating, that put him at ease. There was such a vast understanding in Toohey's eyes and such an unfastidious kindness-no, what a word to think of-such an unlimited kindness. It was as .if one could hide nothing from him, but it was not necessary·to hide it, because he would forgive any- thing. They were the most unaccusing eyes that Keating had ever seen. . ''But, Mr. Toohey,\" he muttered, \"I did want to ... \" \"You .wanted to thank me for my article,\" said Toohey and made a little grimace of gay despair. \"And here I've been trying so hard to prevent you from doing it. Do let me get away with it, won't you? There's no reason. why you should thank me. If 228"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"you happened to deserve the things I said-well, the credit be- longs. to you, not to me. Doesn:t it?'' \"But I was so happy that you thought I'm ... \". \". . . a great architect?' But surely, my boy, you knew that. Or · weren't you quite sure? Never quite sure of it?'' \"Well, I .... \" . ·It was only a second's pause. And it seemed to Keating that this pause was all Toohey had wanted to hear from him; Toohey did not wait foi: the rest, but spoke as if he had. received a full an- swer, and ·an answer that pleased him. \"And as for the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, who can deny that · it's an extraordinary a.chievement? You know, I was greatly in- trigued by its plan. It's a most ingenious plan. A brilliant plan. Very unusual. Quite different from what I have observed in your preVious work: Isn't it?'' ''Naturally,\" said Keatipg, his voice clear and hard for the first time,·~ problem was different from anything I'd done-before, so I wo~ out that plan to fit the particular requirements of the problem.\" · . ''Of course,\" said Toohey gently. \"A beautiful piece of work. You should be proud of it\" · Keating noticed that Toohey's eyes stood centered in the mid- dle of the lenses and the lenses stood focused straight on his pu- pils, and Keating knew suddenly that Toohey knew he had not designed the plan of the CosmQ-Slotnick Building. This did not frighten him. What frightened him was that he saw approval in Toohey's eyes. • . \"If you must feel-no, not gratitude, gratitude is such an em- barrassing word-but, shall we say, app:eciation?'' Toohey con- tinued, and his ·voice had grown· softer, as· if· Keating were a fellow conspirator who Would know that the words used were to be, from now on, a cOde for a private meaning, \"you might thank me for understanding. the symbolic implications-of your building and for stating them in words as you. stated them ·in marble. Since, of course, you ·are not just a common mason, but a. thinker· in· stone.\" \"Yes,'' said Keating, \"that was my abstract theme,\" when I de- signed the building-the great masses and the flowers of culture. I've always believed that true culture springs from the common ·man. Butl had no hope that anyone would ever understand me.\" Toohey smiled. His thin lips slid open, his .teeth showed. He was not looking at ·Keating. He was looking . down at his own hand, the long, slender, sensitive hand of a concert pianist, mov- ing a sheet of paper on the desk. Then he sai~ \"Perhaps we~re brothers of the spirit, Keating. The human spirit That is all that matters in life\" -not. looking at Keating, but past him, the lenses raised flagrantly to a line over Keatfug's face. And ·Keating knew that Toohey knew he had never thought of 229"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"any abstract theme until he'd read that article, and more: that Toohey approved again. When the lenses moved slowly to Keating's face, the eyes were sweet wiJh affection, an affection very cold and very real. Then Keating felt as if the walls of the room were moving gently in upon him, pushing him into a terri- ble intimacy, not with Toohey, but with some unknown guilt. He wanted to leap to his feet and run. He sat still, his mouth half open. · And without knowing what prompted him,· Keating. heard his own voice in the silence: \"And. I did want to say how glad I was that you escaped that maniac's bullet yesterday, Mr. Toohey.\" · \"Oh? ... Oh, thanks. That? Well! Don't let it upset you. Just one of the minor penalties one pays for prominence in public '\"' \" we. \"I've never liked Mallory. A strange sort of person. Too tense. I don't like people who're tense. I've never liked his work ei- ther.\" · \"Just an exhibitionist. Won't amount to much.\" \"It wasn't illy idea, of course, to give him a try. It was Mr. Slotnick's. Pull, you know. But Mr. Slotnick knew better in the end.\" . \"Did Mallory ever mention my name to you?\" \"No. Never.\" \"I haven't even met him, you know. Never saw him before·. Why did he do it?\" And then.it was Toohey who sat still, before what he saw on Keating's face; Toohey,. alert and insecure for the first time. This was it, thought Keating, this was the bond between them, and the bond was fear; and more, much more than that, but fear was the unly recognizable name to give it. And he knew, with unreason- ing finality, that he liked Toohey better than any man he had ever met. \"Well, you know how it is,\" said Keating brightly, hoping that the commonplace he was about to utter would close the subject. \"Mallory is an incompetent and knows it and he decided to take it out on you as a symbol of the great and the able.\" But instead of a smile, Keating saw the shot of Toohey's sud- den glance at him; it was not a glance, it was a fluoroscope, he thought he could feel it crawling searchingly inside his bones. Then Toohey's face seemed to harden, drawing together again in composure, and Keating knew that Toohey had found relief somewhere, in his bones or in his gaping, bewildered face, that some hidden immensity of ignorance within him had given Toohey reassurance. Then Toohey said slowly, strangely, deri- sively: · · \"You and I, we're going to be great friends, Peter.\" 230"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Keating let a moment pass before he caught himself to answer hastily: \"Oh, I hope so, Mr. Toohey!\" \"Really, Peter! I'm not as old as all that, am I? 'Ellsworth' is the monument to my parents' peculiar taste in nomenclature.\" \"Yes ... Ellsworth,\" \"That's better. I really don't mind the name, when compared to some of the things I've been called privately-and publicly- these many years. Oh, well. Flattering. When one makes enemies one· knows that. one's dangerous where it's necessary to be dan-. gerous. There are things that must be destroylld-or they'll de- stroy us. We'll see a great deal of each other, Peter.\" The voice was smooth and sure now, with the finality of a deci.sion .tested and reached, with the certainty that never again would anything in Keating be a question mark to him. \"For instance, I've been thinking for some time of getting together a few young architect&-{ know so many of them-just an informal little or- ganization, to exchange ideas, you know, to develop a spirit of co-operation, to follow a common line of action for the common good of the profession·· if ·necessity arises.

It was, laid before Toohey, the. first bit of sincerity and of impor- tance within Keating's beiJig. \"How ptetty,~'·said Toohey; \"Young love. Spring and dawn and heaven and drugstore chocolates at a dollar and a quartet a box. The prerogative .of the gods· and of the movies .... Oh, I do ap- prove, Peter. I tbink it's lovely.

The book was thin and black, with scarlet letters forming: Clouds and_ Shrouds by Lois Cook. The jacket said that it was a record of Miss Cook's travels around-the world. . - Keating leaned back with a sense of warmth and well-being. He liked this book. It had made the routine of his Sunday morn- ing breakfast a profound spiritual experience; he was certain that it was profound, because he didn't understand it. Peter Keating had never felt the need to formulate abstract convictions .. But he had a working substitute. \"A thing is not high if one can reach it; itis not gi'eat if one cim reason about it; it is not deep if one can see its bottom\"-this had always been his credo, unstated and unquestioned. This spared him any at- tempt to reach, reason or see;. and it cast a nice reflection of scorn on those who made the attempt. So he was able to enjoy the work of Lois Cook. He felt uplifted by the knowledge of his own capacity to respond to the abstract,_ the profound, the ·ideal. Toohey had said: \"That's just it, sound as sound, the poetry of words as words, style as a revolt against style. But only the finest spirit can appreciate it, Peter.\" Keating .. thought he could talk or this book to his friends, and if they did not understand he would know that he was superior to them. He would not need to explain that superiority-that's just it, \"superiority as superiority\"- automatically denied to those who asked for explanations. He loved the book. - _ He reached for another piece of toast. He saw, at the end of the table, left there for him by his mother, the heavy pile of the Sun- day paper. He picked it up, feeling strong enough, in this mo- ment, in the confidence of his· secret spiritual grandeur, to face the whole world contained in that pile. He pulled out the rotogra- vure section. He stopped. He saw the reproduction of a drawing: . the Enright House by Howard Roark. He did not need to see the caption or the brusque signature in the comer of the sketch; he knew that no one else had conceived that house and he knew the manner of drawing, serene and vio- lent at once, the pencil lines like high-tension wires on the paper, . slender and innocent to see, but not to be touched. It was a struc- ture on a broad space by the East River. He did not grasp it as 233"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"a building, at first glance, but as a rising mass of rock crystal. There was the same severe, mathematical order. holding together a free, fantastic growth; straight lines and clean .angles, space slashed with a knife, yet in a harmony of formation as delicate as the work of a jeweler; .an incredible variety of shapes, each sep- arate unit unrepea~ bot leading inevitably to the next one and to the whole; so that the futUre inhabitants were to have, not a square cage out of a square pile of cages, but each a single house held to the other houses like a single crystal to the side of a rock. Keating looked at the sketch. He bad kn_own for a long time that Howard Roark had been chosen to build the Enright House. He had seen a few mentions of R~'s name in the papers; not much, all of it to be summed up only as \"soine young architect chosen by Mr. Enright for some reason, probably an interesting young architect.\" The caption under the drawing annowiced that the construction of the project was to begin at once. Well, thought Keating, and dropped the paper, so what? The paper fell beside the black and scarlet book. He looked at both. He felt dimly as if Lois Cook were his defense against Howard Roark. \"What's that, Petey?'' his mother's voice asked behind him . . He handed the paper to her over his shoulder. The paper fell past him back to the table in !l second. . \"Oh,\" shrugged Mrs. Keating. \"Huh ... \" She stood beside him. Her trim silk dress was fitted too tightly, revealing the solid rigidity of her corset; a small pin glittered at · her throat, small enough to display ostentatiously that ·it was made of real diamonds. She was like the new apartment into which they had moved: conspicuously ·expensive. The apart- ment's decoration had been Kea~g's first professional job for himself. It had been furnished in fresh, new mid- Victorian. It was conservative and stately. Over the ftreplace in the drawing room bung a large old painting of what was not but looked like an il- lustrious ancestor. . · ''Petey sweetheart, I do bate to rush you on a Sunday morning, but isn't it time to dress up? I've got to run now and I'd bate you to forget .the time and be late, it's so nice of Mr. Toohey asking you to his bouse!\" \"Yes, Mother.\" \"Any famous guests coming too?'' \"No. No guests. But there will be one other ~on there. Not . famous.\" She looked at him expectantly._ He added: \"Katie will be there.\" · . The name seemed to have no effect on her whatever. A strange assurance had coated her lately, like a layer of fat through which that· particular question could penetrate no longer. \"Just a family tea,\" he emphasized. \"That's what he said.\" \"Very nice of him,_l'm sure Mr. Toohey is a very intelligent man.\" 234"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"\"Yes, Mother.\" He rose impatiently and went to his room. It was; Keating's first visit to the distinguished residential hotel where Catherine and her uncle had moved recently. He did not notice . much about the apartment, beyond remembering that it was simple, very clean and smartly modest, that it contained a great number of books and very few pictures, but these authentic and precious. One never remembered the apartment of Ellsworth Toohey, only its host. The host, on this Sunday afternoon, wore a dark gray suit, correct as a uniform, and bedroom slippers of black patent leathertrimmed with red; the· slippers mocked the severe elegance of the suit, yet completed the elegance as an au- dacious anticlimax. He sat in a broad, low chair and his face wore an expression of cautious gentleness, so cautious that Keating and Catherine felt, at times, as if they were insignificant soap· bubbles. Keating did not like the way Catherine sat on the edge of a chair, hunched, her legs drawn awkwardly together. He wished she would not wear the same suit for the third season, but she did. She kept her eyes on one point somewhere in the middle of the carpet. She seldom looked at Keating. She never looked at her uncle. Keating found no trace of that joyous admiration with which she had always spoken of Toohey, which he had expected to see her display in his presence. There was something heavy and colorless about Catherine;' and very tired. Toohey's valet brought in the tea tray. ''You will pour, won't you please, my dear?\" said Toohey to Catherine. \"Ah, there's nothing like tea in the afternoon. When the British Empire collapses, historians will find that it had made but two invaluable contributions to civilization-this tea ritual and the detective. novel. Catherine, my dear, do you have to grasp that pot handle . as if it were a meat. axe? aut never mind, it's charming; it's really what we love -you for, Peter ana I, we wouldn't love you if you were graceful as a duchess-'-who wants a duchess nowadays?\" Catherine poured the tea and spilled it on the glass table top, which she had never done before. · \"I did want to see you two together for once,\" said Toohey, holding a delicate cup balanced nonchalantly. \"Perfectly silly of me, isn't it? There's really nothing to make an occasion of, but then I'm silly and sentimental at times, like all of us. My com- pliments on your choici, Catherine. I owe you an apology; I never suspected you of such good taste. You and Peter make a wonderful couple. YmF-ll do a great deal for him. You'll cook his Cream of Wheat, launder his handkerchiefs and bear his children, though of course the children will all have measles at one time or. another, which is a nuisance.\" 235"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"''But, after all, you ... you do approve of it?\" Keating asked anxiously .. \"AppiQve of it? Of what. Peter?\" \"Of our marriage ... eventually.\" . \"What a superfluous question, Peter! Of course, I approve of it. But how young you are! That's the way of young people-- they make an issue where none exists. You asked that as if the whole thing were important enough to disapprove of.\" \"Katie and I met seven years ago,\" said Keating defensively. \"And it was love at first sight of course?\" \"Yes,\" said Keating and felt himself being ridiculous. \"It must have been spring,\" said Toohey. \"It usually is.·There's always a dark movie theater, and two people lost to the world, their hands clasped together...,-but hands do perspire when held too long, don't they? Still, it's beautiful to be in love. The sweet- est story ever told-and the tritest. Don't turn away like that. Catherine. We must never allow ourselves to lose our sense of humor.\" He smiled. The. kindliness of his sinile embraced them both. The kindliness was so great that it made their love seem small and mean, because only something contemptible could evoke such imniensity of compassion. He asked: \"Incidentally, Peter, when do you intend to get married?\" \"Oh, well ... we've never really set a definite date, you know how it's been, all the things happening to me and now Katie has this work of hers and . . . And, by the way,\" he added sharply, because that matter of Katie's work irritated him without reason, ''when we're married, Katie will have to give that up. I don't ap- prove of it.\" ''But of course,\" said Toohey, ''I don't approve of it either, if Catherine doesn't like it.\" Catheiine was working as day nursery attendant at the Clifford Settlement House. It had been her own idea. She had visited the settlement often with her uncle, who conducted' classes in eco- nomics there, and she had become interested in the· work. \"But I do like it!\" she said with sudden excitement. .\"I don't see why you resent it. Peter!\" There was a h~~[sh little note in her voice, defiant and unpleasant. \"I've never enjoyed anything so much in my life. Helping people who're helpless and unhappy. I went there this morning-! didn't have to, but I wanted to-and then I rushed so on my way home, I didn't have time to change my clothes, but that doesn't matter, who cares what I look like? And\"-the harsh note was gone, she was speaking eagerly and very fast-\"Uncle Ellsworth, imagine! little Billy Hansen had a sore throat-you remember Billy? And the nurse wasn't there, and I had to swab his throat with Argyrol, the poor thing! He had the most awful white mucus patches down in his throat!'' Her voice seemed to shine, as if she were speaking of great 236"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"beauty. She looked at her uncle .. For the first time Keating saw the affection he· had expected. She went on speaking about her . work. the children, the settlement. Toohey listened gravely. He said nothing. But the earnest attention in his eyes changed him, his mocking gaiety vanished and he forgot his own advice, he · was being serious, very . serious indeed. When he noticed that Catherine's plate was empty, he offered her the sandwich tray with a simple gesture and made it, somehow, a gracious gesture of respect. · · Keating waited impatiently till she paused for an instant. He wanted to change the subject. He glanced about the room and saw the Sunday papers. This was a question he had wanted to ask for a long time. He asked cautiously: \"Ellsworth ·. . . what do you think of Roark?\" \"Roark? Roark?\" asked Toohey. ''Who is Roark?\" The too innocent, too trifling manlier in which he repeated the name, with the faint, contemptuous question mark quite audible at the end, . made Keating certain that Toohey knew the name well. One did not stress total ignorance of a subject if one were in total ignorance of it. Keating said: ''Howard Roark. You know, the architect. The one who's doing the Enright House.\" · · \"Oh? Oh, yes, someone's doing that Enright House at last, isn't he?\" ''There's .a picture. of it in .the Chronicle today.\" ''Is there? I did glance through the Chronicle.\" \"And ... what do you think of that building?\" \"If it were important, I should have rememberect it.\" \"Of course!\" Keating's syllables danced, as if his breath caught at each one in passing: \"It's an awful, crazy thing! Like nothing you ever saw or want to see!\" • He felt a sense of deliverance. It was as if he had spent his life believing that he carried a congenital disease, and suddenly the words of the greatest spe¢\\alist on earth had pronounced him healthy. He wanted to laugh, freely, stupidly, without dignity. He wanted to talk. . \"Howard's . a friend of mine,\" he said happily. \"A friend of yours? You know him?\" \"Do. I know him! Why, we went to school together-Stanton, you know-why, he lived at our houSe for three years, I can tell you the color of his underwear and how he takes a shower..:..._I'v~ seen him!\" \"He lived at your house in· Stanton?\" Toohey repeated. Toohey spoke with a kind of cautious precision. The sounds of his voice were small and . dry and final, like the cracks of matches being broken. It was very peculiar, thought Kiating. Toohey was asking him a great many questions about· Howard Roark. But the questions 237"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"did not make sense. They were not .about buildings, they were not about architecture at all. They were pointless personal questions-strange to ask about a man of whom he had never . heard before. \"Does he laugh often?'' \"Very rarely.\" \"Does he seem unhappy?\" \"Never.\" \"Did he have many friends at Stanton?'' \"He's never had any ·friends anywhere.\" ''The boys didn't like him?\" \"Nobody can like him.\" \"Why?\" \"He makes you feel it would be an impertinence to like him.\" \"Did he go out, drink, have a good time?'' \"Never.\" \"Does he like money?'' \"No.\" \"Does he like to be admired?'' \"No.\"· \"Does he believe in God?'' \"No.\" \"Does he talk much?'' \"Very little.\" ''Does he listen if others discuss any ... ideas with him?'' \"He listens. It would be better if he didn't.\" ''Why?'' \"It woidd. be less insulting-if you know what I mean, when a man listens like that and you know it hasn't made the slightest bit of difference to him.\" \"Did he always want to be an architect?'' \"He ... \" ''What's the matter: Peter?'' \"Nothing ..

You don't ask what he'd do if he didn't want to be an architect.\" \"No,\" said Toohey. \"You ask what he'd do if he couldn't be an architect.\" \"He'd walk over corpses. Any and all of them. All of us. But he'd be an architect.\" Toohey folded his napkin, a crisp little square of cloth on his knee; he folded it accurately, once across each way, and he ran his fingernail along the edges to inake a sharp crease. 238"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"\"Do you remember our little youth group of architects, Peter?\" he asked. \"I'm ·making arrangements for a first meeting soon. I've spoken to many of our future members and you'd be flat- tered by what they said about you as our prospective chairman.\" They talked pleasantly for another half hour. When Keating rose to go, Toohey declared: \"Oh, yes. I did speak to Lois Cook about you. You'll hear . from her shortly.\" ''Thank you so much, Ellsworth. By the way, I'm reading Clouds and Shrouds.\" \"And?\"-· . \"Ob, it's tremendous. You know, Ellsworth, it ... it makes you think so differently about everything you've thought before.\" \"Yes,\" said Toohey, \"doesn't it?\" He stood at the window, looking out at the last sunshine of a cold, bright afternoon. Then he turned !llld said: \"It's a lovely day. Probably one of th~ last this year. Why don't you take Catherine out for a little walk, Peter?\" \"Oh, I'd love to!\" said Catherine eagerly. ''Well, go ahead.\" Toohey smiled gaily. \"What's the matter, Catherine? Do you have to wait for my permission?'' When they walked out together, when they were alone· in the cold brilliance of streets flooded with late sunlight, Keating felt himself recapturing everything Catherine bad always meant to him, the strange emotion that he could not keep in the presence of others. He closed his hand over hers. She withdrew her hand, took off her glove and slipp!l<f her fingers into his. And then be thought suddenly that hands did perspire When held too long, and he walked faster in irritation. He thought that they were walking there like Mickey and Minnie Mouse and that they probably ap- peared ridiculous to the p~sers-by. To shake himself free of· these thoughts he glanced .down at her face~ She was looking straight ahead at the gold light, he saw her delicate profile and the faint crease of a smile in the comer of her mouth, a smile of quiet happiness. But he noticed that the edge of her ~yelid was pale and he began to wonder whether she was anemic. Lois Cook sat on the floor in the middle of her living ~oom, her legs crpssed Turkish fashion, showing large bare knees, gray stockings rolled over tight garters, and a piece of faded pink drawers. Peter Keating sat on the edge of a violet satin chaise lounge. Never before had he felt uncomfortable at a fll'St inter- view with a client. Lois Cook was thirty-seven. She had stated insistently, in her publicity and in private conversation, that she was sixty-four. It was repeated as a whimsical joke and it created about her name a vague impression of eternal youth. She was tall, dry, narrow- shouldered and broad-hipped. She had a long, sallow face, and 239"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"eyes· set close together. Her bair hung about her ears in greasy strands. Her fingernails were broken.

It seemed to be the first direct communication betw~ them. \"Isn't that interesting!

It sounded as- if the speaker . were being very brave. It was a satisfying bravery; it never aroused antagonism. For an author who did ilot sell, her name seemed strangely fa- mous and honored. She was the standard-bearer of a vanguard of intellect and revolt. Only it was not quite clear to him just ex- actly what the revolt was against. Somehow, he preferred not to· know. He designed .the house as she wished it. It was a three-floor edifice~ part marble, part stucco, adorned with gargoyles and car_- riage lanterns. It looked like a structure from an-amusement park. His sketch· of it was reproduced in more publications than any other drawing he had ever made, with the exception of the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. One commentator expressed the opin- . ion that \"Peter Keating is showing a promise of being more than just a bright young man with a knack- for pleasing stuffy moguls of big business. He is venturing into the field of intellectual ex- perimentation with a client such as Lois Cook.\" Toohey referred to the house as \"a cosmic joke.\" • But a peculiar sensation remained in Keating's mind: the feel-· 241"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"ing of. an aftertaste. He would experience a dim flash of it while working on some important structure he liked; he would experi- ence it in the moments .when he felt proud of his work. He could not identify the quality of the feeling; but he k.~w that part of it was a sense ofshame. . · Once, he confessed it to. Ellsworth Toohey. Toohey laughed. ''That's good for you, Peter.

She returned without pur- · pose, merely because she could not stay in her country house longer than three days after hedast visit to the quarry. She had to be in the city; it ·was a sudden necessity, irresistible and sense- less. She expected nothing of the city. But she wanted the feeling of the streets and the buildings holding her there. In the morning, when she awakened and heard the muffled roar of traffic far be\" low, the sound was a humiliation, a reminder of where she w:as and why. She stood at the window, her arms spread wide, holding on to each side of the frame; it; was as if she held a piece of the city, all the streets and rooftops outlined on the glass between ~er two bands. . She went out aloiu~ for long. walks. She walked fast, her hands in the pockets of an old coat, its.collar raised. She had. told her- self that she was not hoping to meet him. She was not looking _ for him. But she had to be out in the streets, blank, purposeless, for hours at a time. . She had always hated the streets of a cit)r. She saw the faces streaming past her, the faces made alike by feat-fear as a com- mon denominator, fear of themselves, fear of all and of one an- other, fear making them ready to pounce upon whatever w~ held sacred by any single one they met. She could not define the na- ture or the reason of that fear. But she had always felt its pres-· ence. She had kept herself clean and free in a single passion-to · touch nothing~ She had liked facing them in the streets, she had liked the imwtence of their\" hatred, because she offered them nothing. to be hurt. She was not free any longer. Each step through the streets hurt her now. She was tied to him--as he was tied to every part of the city. He was a namt:lless worker doirig some nameless job, lost in these crowds, dependent on them, to be hurt by any one of them, to be shared by her with the whole city. She hated the thought of him on the sidewalks people had used. She hated the thought of a clerk handing to him a package of cigarettes across a counter. 242"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"She hated the elbows touching his elbows in a subway train.

There was. an air about· the eighteen persons present which he could not define, . but which gave him a sense of comfort, a security he had not ex- perienced in solitude/or in any:other·gaUtering; and part of the comfort was the knowledge that all the others felt the same .way for the l!anie unaccountable reason.

She looked up at the 'twilight' of the ceiling, left untouched above the chaJ1deliers, and she noted how far it was above the guests, how - dominant and undisturbed. The huge crowd of guestS did not dwarf her hall; it stood over them like a square box C?f space, gro- tesquely out of scale; and ir was tJtis wasted expanse of air im- prisoned above them that gave the occasion an aspect of regal Iuxilry;:-it was like the lid of a jewel -case, unnecessarily large over a Hat bottom holding a single small gem. · The guests moved in tWo broad, changfug currepts that drew them all, sooner or later, toward two whirlpools; at the center of one stood Ellsworth Toohey, of the other-Peter Keating. Eve- ning clothes were pot becoming to Ellsworth Toohey; the rectan- gle of white shirt front prolonged his face, stretching him out into two dimensions; the wings of his tie made his thin neck fook like that of a plucked chicken; pale, bluish and. ready to be twisted by a single movement of some strong fist. But he wore his clothes better than any man present. He w 0 re them with the careless im- · pertinence of utter ease in the unbecoming, and the very gro- tesqueness of his appearance became a declaration of his superiority, a superiority great enough to warrant disregard·of so . much ungainliness. . · He was. saying to a somber young female who wore glasses and a low-cut evening gown: \"My dear, you will never be more than a dilettante of the intellect, unless you submerge yourself in some cause greater than yourself.\" . He was saying to an obese gentlemen with a face turning pur-· pie. in the heat of an argument: \"But, my friend, I might not like it either.

There are so many things in life so much more important than happiness.\" . Keating made his way slowly toward Domipique. She stood leaning bac~ as if the air were a support solid enough for her thin, naked shoulder blades. Her evening gown was the color of glass. He had the feeling that he should be able to see the wall behind her, throu.gh her body. She seemed too fragile 1o exist; and that very fragility spoke ·or some frightening strength which held her anchored to existence with a bpdy insufficient for real- ity. When h~ approached, she made no effort to ignore him; she turned to him, she answered; but the monotonous precision o.f her answers stopped him, made him helpless, made him leave her. in a few moments, · . When Roark and Heller entered, Kiki Holcombe met them at the door. Heller presented Roark to her, and -she spoke as .she al- ways did, her voice like a shrill rocket _sweeping all opposition aside by sheer speed ... \"Oh, Mr. Roark, I've been so eager to meet you! We've all heard so much about you!

She was ceruiin that he intended no insolence; it was not in his voice .nor his manner;. but insolence had been her first iinpression of him.

She said: \"We've all been so interested in your work. Your first build- ing?\" .·. \"My fifth.\" 257"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"''Oh, indeed? Of course. How interesting.\" She clasped her hands, and turned to greet a new arrival. Hel- ler said: . ' ·~om do you want to meet first? ... There's Dominique Francon lookipg at us. Come on.\" . Roark turned; he saw Dominique standing .alone across the room. There was no expression on her face, not even an effort to avoid expression; it was ·strange to see a human face presenting a bone structure and an arrangement of mliscles, but no meaning, a face as a simple anatomical feature, like a shoulder or an arm, not a mirror of sensate perception any longer. She looked at them as they approached. Her feet stood posed· oddly, two small trian- gles pointed straight and pl!l'allel, as if there were no floor around her but the few square inches under her soles and she were ·safe . so long as she did not move or look down. He felt a violent plea- sure, because she seemed too fragile to stand the brutality of what he was doing; and because she stood it so well. \"Miss Francon, may I present Howard Roark'!\" said Heller. He had not raised his voice to pronounce the name; he won- dered why it had sounded so stressed; then he thought that the si- lence had caught the name and held it still; but there had been no silence: Roark's face was pc)litely blank and Dominique was say- ing correctly: . \"How do you do, Mr. Roark.\" .Roark bowed: \"How do you do, Miss Francon.\" She said: ''The Enright House ... \" · She said it as if she bad not wanted to pronounce these three words; and as if they -named, not a house, but many things be- yon!i·it. Roark said: \"Yes, Miss Francon.\" Then she smiled, the correct, perfunctory smile with which one greets an introduction. She said: . · \"I know Roger Enright. He is almost a friend of the family.\" \"I haven't had the pleasure of meeting many friends of Mr. Enright.\" - . \"I remember once Father invited him to dinner. It was a mis- erable dinner.

They walked together past the wooden fence, into the, jungle of naked steel and planks that was to be the Enright House. Her high heels stepped lightly over lime-spattered boards and she walked, leaning back, in careless, insolent elegance. She stopped and looked at the sky-held in a frame of steel,- the sky that seemed more distant than usual, thrust back by the sweeping length of beams. She looked at the steel cages of future projec- tions, at the insolent angles, at the incredible complexity of this shape conring to life as a simple, logical whole, a naked skeleton with planes of air to form the walls, a naked skeleton on a cold winter day, with a sense of birth and promise, like a bare tree with a first touch of green. · \"Oh;Roger!\" He looked at her and saw the kind of face one should expect to see in church at Easter. - ''I didn't underestimate either one,~· he 'said dryly. \"Neither you nor the building.\" . . \"Good mom~g,\" said a low, hard voice beside them. She waS not shocked to see Roark. She had not heard him ap- proaching, but it would have been unnatural to think. of this building without him. She felt that he simply was there, that he had been there from the moment she crossed the outside fence, that this structure was he, in a manner more personal than his · body. He stood before them, his hand thrust into the pockets of a loose coat, his hair hatless in the cold. · \"Miss Francon-Mr. Roark,\" said Enright. \"We have met once,\" she said, \"at the Holcombes. If Mr. Roark remembers.\" \"Of course, Miss Francon,\" said Roark. \"I wanted Miss Francon to see it,\" said Enright. \"Shall I show you around?\" Roark aslced him. \"Yes, do please,\" she answered first. The three of them walked together through the structure, and the workers stared curiously at Dominique. Roark explained the layout of future rooms, the system of elevators, the heating plant, the arrangeme~t of windows-as he would have explained it to a contractor's assistant. She asked questions and he answered. \"How many cubic feet of space, Mr. Roark?\" ·\"How many tons of steel?\" \"Be careful of these pipes..,_ Miss Franoon.

You might discuss petit point too. That's her hobby.\" He went away, thinking happily about Mrs. Lonsdale's house, and he forgot his question. Later, he remembered it resentfully, and shrugged, and told himself that the best part of Dominique's help was her desire not to see him. As a compensation, he found pleasure in attending the meetings of Toohey's Council of American Builders. He did not know why he should think of it as compensation, but he did and 291"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"it was comforting. He listened attentively when Gordon L. Pres- cott made a speech on the meaning of architecture. · \"And thus the intrinsic significance of our craft lies in the philosophical fact that. we deal in nothing. We create emptiness through which certain physical bodies are to move-we shall designate them for convenience as humans. By emptiness I mean what is commonly known as rooms. Thus it is only the crass lay- man who thinks that we put up stone walls. We do nothing of the kind. We put up emp~ess, as I have proved. This leads us to a corollary of astronomical importance: to the unconditional ac- ceptance of the premise that 'absence' is superior to 'presence.' That is, to the acceptance of non-acceptance. I shall state this in simpler terms-for the sake of clarity: 'nothing' is superior to 'something.' Thus it is clear tha! the architect is more than a bricklayer-since the fact of bricks is a secondary illusion any- way. The architect is a metaphysical priest dealing in basic essen- tials, who has the courage to face the primal conception of reality as nonreality-since there is nothing and he creates nothingness. If this sounds like. a contradiction, it is not a proof of bad logic, but of a higher logic, the dialectics of all life and art. Should you wish to make the inevitable deductions from this basic concep- tion, you may come to conclusions of vast sociological impor- tance. You may see that a beautiful woman is inferior to a non-beautiful one, that the literate is inferior to the illiterate, that the rich.is inferior to the poor, and the able to the incompetent. The architect is the concrete illustration of a cosmic paradox. Let us be modest in the vast pride of this realization. Everything else is twaddle.\" One could not worry about one's value or greatness when lis- tening to this. It made self-respect unnecessary. Keating listened in thick contentment He glanced at the oth- ers. There was an attentive silence in the audience; they all liked it as he liked it. He saw a boy chewing gum, a man cleaning his fmgemails with the comer of a match folder, a youth stretched out loutishly. That, too, pleased Keating; it was as if they said: We are. glad to listen to the sublime, but it's not necessary to be too damn reverent about the sublime. The Council of American Builders met once a month and en- gaged in no tangible activity, beyond listening to speeches and sipping an inferior brand of root beer. Its membership did not grow fast either in quantity or in quality. There were no concrete results achieved. The meetings of the Council were held in a huge, empty room over a garage on the West Side. A long, narrow, unventilated stairway led to a door bearing the Council's name; there were folding chairs inside, a table for the chairman, and a wastebasket. The A.G.A. considered the Council of American Builders a silly joke. \"Why do you want to waste time on those cranks for?\" 292"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Francon asked Keating in the ro~-lit satin-stuffCd rooms of the .A.G.A., wrinkling his nose with.fastidious amusement. \"Damned if I know,\" Keating answered gaily. \"I like them.\" Ellsworth Toohey attended every meeting of the Council, but did not speak.

Johnny had waited for that suit a year and a half, his mother being very poor. Ellsworth did not sneak or hide, but committed his act openly, with systematic deliberation: he walked to the tap, turned it on, stood in the middle of the lawn and directed the hose at Johnny, his aim faultlesS-with Johnny's mother just a few steps behind him down the street, with his own mother and father and the visiting minister in full view on the Toohey porch. Johnny Stokes was a bright kid with dimples a,td golden curls; people always turned to look at Johnny Stokes. Nobody had ever turned to look at Ellsworth T~. . The shock and amazement of the grownups present were such that nobody rushed to stop Ellsworth for a. long mqment. He 293"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"/ stood. bracing his thin little body against the violence of the noz- zle jerking in his hands; never all6wing· it to ·leave its objective until he felt satisfied; then he let it drop, the water hissing through the grass, and made two steps toward the porch, and stopped, waiting, his head high, delivering himself for punish- ment The punishment would have come from Johnny if Mrs. Stokes had not seized her boy and held him. Ellsworth did not turn to the Stokeses behind him, but said, slowly, distinctly, look- ing at his mother and the--minister: \"Johnny is a dirty bully. He beats up all the boys in school.\" This was true. The question of punishment became an ethical problem. It was difficUlt to punish Ellsworth under any circumstances, because of his fragile body and delicate health; besides, it seemed wrong to chastise a boy who had sacrificed himself to avenge injustice, and done it bravely, in the open, ignoring his own physical weak- ness; somehow, he looked like a martyr. Ellsworth did not say so; he said nothing further; but his mother said it. The minister was inclined to agree with her. Ellsworth was sent to his room with- out supper. He did not complain. He remained there meekly- and refused the food his mother sneaked up to him, late at night, disobeying her husband. Mr. Toohey insisted on paying Mrs. Stokes for Johnny's suit. Mrs. Thcihey let him do it, sullenly; she did not like Mrs. Stokes. Ellsworth's father managed the Boston branch of a national chain of shoe stores. He earned a modest, comfortable salary and owned a modest, ~mfortable home in an undistinguished suburb of Boston. The secret sorrow of his life was that he did not head a business of his own. But he was a quiet, conscientious, unim- aginative man, and an early marriage had ended all his ambition. Ellsworth's mother was a thin, restless woman who adopted and discarded five religions in nine years. She had delicate fea- . tures, the kind that made her look beautiful for a few years of her life, at the one period of full flower, never before and never af- terward. Ellsworth was her idol. His sister Helen, five years older, was a good-natured, unremarkable girl, not beautiful but pretty and healthy; she presented no problem. Ellsworth, how- ever, had been born puny in health. His mother adored him from the moment the doctor pronounced him unfit to survive; it made her grow in spiritual stature-to know the extent of her own magnanimity in her love for so uninspiring an· object; the bluer and uglier baby Ellsworth looked, the more passionate grew her love for him. She· was almost disappointed when he survived without becoming an actual cripple. She took little interest in Helen; there was no martyrdom in loving Helen. The girl was so obviously more deserving of love that it seemed just to deny it to her. Mr. Toohey, for reasons which he could not explain, was not too fond of his son. Ellsworth, however, was the ruler of the 294"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"household, by a tacit, voluntary submission of both parents, though his father could never understand the cause of his own share in that submission. In the evenings, under. the lamp of the family sitting room, Mrs. Toohey woul4 begin, in a tense, challenging voice, angry and defeated in advance: \"Horace, I want a bicycle. A bicycle for Ellsworth. All the boys his age have them, Willie Lovett just got ·a new one the other day, Horace. Horace,. I want a bicycle for Ellsworth.\" · \"Not right now, Mary,\" Mr. Toohey would answer -wearily. \"Maybe next summer.· ... Just now we can't afford ... \" Mrs. Toohey would argue, her voice rising in jerks toward a shriek.- . \"Mother, what forr' said Ellsworth, his voice soft. rich and clear, lower than the voices of his parents, yet cutting across them, commanding, strangely persuasive. ''There's many things we need, mQre thaJr\"\"\"\"\"a bi~ycle. What do you care about Willie Lovett? I don't like Willi~ Willie's a dumbbell. Willie can afford it, because his pa'~ got his-own dry-goods store. His pa's a show: off. I don't want a bicycle.\" · Every word of this was true, and Ellsworth did not want a bi- cycle . .But Mr. Toohey)ookedat him strangely, wonderfug what had ml!de him say that. He saw his son's eyes looking at him blankly from behind the small glasses; the eyes were not osten- tatiously sweet, not reproachful, not malicious; just blimk. Mr. Toohey felt that be should be grateful for his son's understanding.....-and wished to ·hell the boy had not ,mentioned thJrt part about the private store. Ellsworth did not get the bicycle . .But he got a polite attention in the house, a respectful solicitude-tender and guilty, from his mother, uneasy and suspicious from his father. Mr. Toohey would do anything rather than be forced into a conversation with Ellsworth-feeling, at the same time, foolish and angry at him- self for his fear. \"Horace, I want a new suit. A new suit for Ellsworth. I saw ·one in a window today and I've ... \" \"Mother, I've got four suits. What do I need· another one for? I don't want to look silly .like Pat Noonan who chaliges them ev- ery day. That's because his pa's got his own ice-cream parlor. Pat's stuck up like a girl about his clothes. I don't want to be a sissy.\" Ellsworth, thought Mrs .. Toohey .at times, happy and fright- ened, is going to be a saint; he doesn't care about material things at all;. not one bit. This was true. Ellsworth did not care about material things. · · He was a thin, pale boy with a bad stomach, and his mother had to watch his diet, as well as his tendency to frequent colds in the head. His sonorous voice was astonishing in his puny 295"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"frame. He sang in the choir, where he had no rivals. At School he was a model pupil. He always knew his lessons, had the neatest copybooks, the cleanest .fingernails, loved Sunday school and preferred reading to athletic games, in which he had no chance. He was not too good at mathematics-which he disliked-but excellent at history. English, civics and penmanship; later, at psy- chology and sociology. He studied co~entiously and bani. He was not like Johnny Stokes, who never listened in class, seldom opened a book at home, yet knew everything almost before the teacher had ex- plained it. Learning came to Johnny automatically, as did all things: his able little fists, his healthy body, his startling good looks, his, overexuberant vitality. But Joltnny did the shocking and the unexpected: Ellsworth did the expected, better than any- one had ever seen it done. When they came to compositions, Johnny would stun the class by some brilliant display of rebel- lion. Given the theme of \"School Days- The Golden Age,\" Johnny came through with a masterly essay on how he hated school aild why. Ellsworth delivered a prose pOem on the glory of school days, which was reprinted iti a local newspaper. Besides, Ellsworth had Johnny beaten hollow when it came. to names and dates; Ellsworth's memory was like a spread of liquid cement: it held anything that fell upon it. Johnny was a shooting . geyser; Ellsworth was a sponge. The children called him \"Elsie Toohey.\" They usually let him have his way, and avoided him when possible, but not openly; they could not figure him out He was helpful. and dependable when they needed assistance with their lessons; he had a sharp wit and could ruin any child by the apt nickname he coined, the kind that hurt; he drew devastating cartoons on fences; he had all the earmarks of a sissy, but somehow he could not be classified as one; he had too much self-assurance and quiet, disturbingly wise contempt for everybody. He was afraid of nothing. He would march right up to the strongest boys, in the middle of ·the street, and state, not yell, in a clear voice that carried for blocks, state without anger-no one had ever seen Ellsworth Toohey angry-\"Johnny Stokes's got a patch on his ass. Johnny Stokes lives in a rented flat. Willie Lovett is a dunce. Pat Noonan is a fish eater.\" Johnny never gave him a beating, and neither did the other boys, because Ellsworth wore glasses. He could not take part in ball games, and was the only child who boasted about it, instead of feeling fmstrated or ashamed like the other boys with substandard bodies. He considered ath- letics vulgar and said so; the brain, he said, was mightier than the brawn; he meant it. He had no close personal friends. He was considered impartial and incorruptible. There were two incidents in his childhood of which his mother was very proud. 296"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"It happened that the wealthy, popular Willie Lovett gave a birthday party on the same day as Drippy Munn, son of a wid- owed seamstress, a wbiniRg boy whose nose was always running. Nobody accepted Drippy's invitation, except the children who were never invited anywhere. Of those asked for both occasions, Ellsworth ·Toohey was the only one who snubbed Willie Lovett and went to Drippy Munn's party, a miserable affair from which he expected and received no pleasure. Willie Lovett's enemies bowled ·and taunted Willie for months afterward-about being passed up in favor of Drippy Munn. It happened that Pat Noonan offered Ellsworth a bag of jelly beans in exchange for a surreptitious peek at his test paper. Ellsworth took the jelly beans and allowed Pat to copy his test. A week later, Ellsworth marched tip to the teacher, laid the jelly beans, untouched, upon her desk and confessed his cri.m,e, with- out naming Ute other culprit. All her efforts to extract that name could not budge him; Ellsworth remained silent; he explained only that the guilty . boy was one of the best students, and he could not sacrifice the boy's record to the demands of his 0\\\\111 conscience. He was the only one punish~pt after school for two hours. Then the . teacher had to drop the matter and let the test m!lfks rem,ain as they were. But it threw suspicion on. the grades of.Johnny Stokes, Pat Noonan, and all the best pupils of the class, except Ellsworth Toohey. · . . Ellsworth was eleven years old when his mother died. Aunt Adeline, his father's maiden sister, .came to live With them and run the Toohey household. Aunt Adeline was a tall, capable woman to whom the word \"horse\" clung in coqjunction ·with the words \"sense\" and ''face.\" The secret sorrow of her life was that she had never inspired romance. Helen became her immediate fa- vorite. She considered Ellsworth an jmp out of hell. But Ellsworth never wavered in his ~er of grave courtesy toward Aunt Adeline. He leaped to pick up her handken:hief, to move her chair, when they had company, particularly masculine com- pany. He sent he~: beautiful Valentines on the appropriate day- with paper lace, rosebuds and love poems. He sang \"Sweet Adeline\" at the top of his town crier's voice. \"You're a maggot, Elsie,\" she told him once. ''You feed on sores.\" ''Then I'll never starve,\" he answered. After a while they reached a state of armed neutrality. Ellsworth was left to grow up as he pleased. In high school Ellsworth became a local celebrity-the star or- ator. For years the school did not refer to a promising boy as a good speaker, bqt as \"a Toohey.\" He won every contest. After- ward, members of the audience- spoke about ''that beautiful boy\"; they did not remember the sorry little figure with the sunken chest, inadequate legs and glasses; they ·remembered the voice. He won every debate. He could prove anything. Once, after beat- ing Willie Lovett with· the affirmative of ''The Pen Is Mightier 297"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"than the Sword,\" he challenged Willie to reverse their positions, took the negative and \\von again., Until the age of sixteen Ellsworth felt himself drawn to the ca- reer of a minister. He thought a great deal about religion. He talked about God and the spirit. He read extensively on the sub- ject He read more books on the history of the church than on the substance of faith. He brought his audience to tears in one of his greatest oratoriclll triumphs with the theme of ''The meek shall inherit the earth.\" At this period he began to acquire friends. He liked to speak of faith and he found those who liked to listen. Only, he discov- ered that the bright, the strong, the able boys of his class felt no need of listening, felt no need of him at all. But the suffering and ill-endowed came to him. Drippy Muon began to follow him about with the silent devotion of a dog. Billy Wilson lost his mother, and came wandering to the Toohey house in the eve- nings, to sit with Ellsworth on the porch, listening, shivering once in a while, saying ·nothing, his eyes wide, dry and pleading. Skinny Dix got infailtile paralysis-and would lie in bed, watch- ing the street comer beyond the window, waiting for Ellsworth. Rusty Hazelton failed to pass in his grades, and sat for many hours, crying, with Ellsworth's cold, steady hand on his shoulder. It was never clear whether they all discovered Ellsworth or Ellsworth discovered them. It seemed to work more like a law of nature: as nature alloWs no vacuum, so pain and Ellsworth Toohey drew each other. His rich, beautiful voice said to them: \"It's good to suffer. Don't complain. Bear, bow, accept-and be grateful that GOd has made you suffer. For this makes you better than the people who are laughing and happy. If you don't understand this, don't try to understand. Everything bad comes from the mind, because the mind asks too many questions. It is blessed ·to believe, not to understand. So if you didn't get passing grades, be glad of it. It means that you are better than the smart bOJS who think too much and too easily.\" People said it was touching, the way Ellsworth's friends clung to him. After they had taken him for a while, they could not do · without him. It was like a drug habit. . Ellsworth was fifteen, when he astonished the Bible-class teacher by an odd question. The teache_r had been elaborating upon the text: \"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" Ellsworth asked: \"Then in order to be truly wealthy, a man should collect souls?\" The teacher was about to ask him what the hell did he mean, but con- trolled himself and asked what did he mean. Ellsworth would not elucidate. At the-age of sixteen, Ellsworth lost interest in religion. He dis- covered socialism. His transition shocked Aunt Adeline. \"In the first place, it is 298"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"blasphemous and drivel,\" she said. \"In the second place, it doesn't make sense. I'm surprised at you, Elsie. 'The poor in spirit'-that was fine, but just 'the poor'-that doesn't sound re- spectable at all. Besides it's not like you.

It's not like you at all.\" \"In the first place, my dear ai,IIlt,\" he answered, \"don't call me Elsie. In the second place, you're wrong.\" The change seemed good for ·Ellsworth. He did not be- come an aggressive zealot. He became gentler, quieter, milder. He became more .attentively considerate of people. It was as if something had taken the nervous edges off his personality and given him new confidence. Those around him began to like him. Aunt Ad-eline stopped worrying. Nothing actual seemed to come of his preoccupation with revolutionary theories. He joined no political partY.. He. read a great deal and. he attended a few dubi- ous meetings, wbere he spoke once or twice; not too well, but mostly sat in a corner, listening, watching, thinking . . . Ellsworth went to Harvard. His mother had willed her life in- surance for that specific purpose. At Harvard his scholastic rec- ord was superlative. He majored in history. Aunt Adeline hl[ld expected to. see him go in for economics and sociology. she hhlf feared that he would end up as a social worker. He didn't. He be- came absorbed in literature and the fine arts. It b.affted her a lit- tle; it was a new trait in him; he had never shown any particular tendencv in ~at direction. \"You're not the arty kind, Elsie,'' she stated \"It don't fit.\" \"You're wrong, auntie,\" he said. Ellsworth's relations with his fellow students were the most unusual of his achievements at Harvard. He made himself ac- cepted Among the proud young descendants of proud old names, he did not·hide the fact of his humble background; he exagger- ated it. He did not tell them that his father was the manager of a shoe st()l'e;'he said that his father was a shoe cobbler. He said it without defiance, bitterness or proletarian arrogance; he said it as if it were a joke on him and-if one looked ·closely into his smile--on them. He acted like a snob; not a flagrant snob, but a natural, innocent one who tries very hard not to be snobbish. He was polite, not in the manner of one seeking favor, but in the manner of one granting it. His attitude was contagious. People did not question the reasons of his superiority; they took it for · granted that such reasons existed. It became· amusing, at first, to accept \"Monk\" Toohey; then it became distinctive and progres- sive. If this was a victory Ellsworth did not seem conscious of it as such; he did not seem to care. He moved among all these un- formed youths, with the assurance of a man who has a plan, a long-range plan set in every detail, and who can spare nothing but amusement for the small incidentals on his way. Ins smile had a secret, closed quality, the smile of a shopkeeper counting 299"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"profits--even though· nothing in particular seemed to be happen- ing. He did not talk about God and the nobility of suffering. He talked about the masses. He proved to a rapt audience, at bull sessions lasting till dawn, that religion bred selfishness; because, he stated, religion overemphasized the importance of the individ- ual spirit; religion preached nothing but a single concern-the salvation of one's own soul. \"To achieve virtue in the absolute sense,\" said Ellsworth Toohey, \"a m8n must be willing to take the foulest crimes upon his soul-for the sake of his brothers. To mortify the flesh is nothing. To mortify the soul is the· only act of virtue. So you think you love the broad -mass of mankind? You know nothing of love. You give two bucks to a strike fund and you think you've done your duty? You poor fools! No gift is worth a damn, unless it's the most precious thing you've got. Give your soul. To a lie? Yes, if others believe it. To deceit? Yes, if others need it. To treachery, knavery, crime? Yes! To whatever it is that seems low- est and vilest· in your eyes.

He held the post of vocational adviser at the university 1 he reviewed books, plays, art exhibitions, he wrote· articles, gave a few lec- tures to small, obscure audiences. Certain tendencies were appar- ent in his work. When reviewing books, he leaned toward novels about the spil rather than the city, about the average rather than the gifted, about the sick rather than the healthy; there was a spe- cial glow in his writing when he referred to stories about \"little peaple\"; \"human\" was his favorite adjective; he preferred charac~ ter study to action, and description to character study; he pre:.. ferred novels without a plot and, above all, novels without a hero. · He was considered outstanding as a vocational adviser. His tiny office at the university *ame an informal confessioniil where students brought all their problems, academic as well lis personal. He was willing. to discuss-with the same gentle; ear- . nest concentration-the choicer of classes, or love affairs. or- most particularly-the selection of a future career. · When consulted on love affairs, Toohey counseled surrender, if it concerned a roipance with a charming little pushover, good for a few drUnken parties-\"let us be modem\"; and renunciation, if it concerned a deep, emotional passion-\"let ·us be grown-up;\" When a boy came to confess a feeling of shame after some un- savory seXual experience, Toohey told him to snap out of it: \"It was damn good for you. There are two. things we must get rid of early in life: a feeling·of personal superiority and.an exaggerated reverence for the seXual act.\" People noticed that Ellsworth Toohey seldom let a boy pursue the career he had chosen. \"No, I wouldn't go in for law if I were you. You're much too tense and passionate about it. A hysterical devotion to one's career does not make for happiness or success. It is wiser to select a profession about which you can be calm, sane and matter-of-fact.

Have you considered anything but your own egotistical satisfaction? Yet a man's career concerns all society. The q!lestion of where you could be most useful to your fellow men comes first. It's not what you can get out of society, it's what you can give. And where opportunities for service are con- cerned, there's no endeavor comparable to that of a surgeon. Think it over.\" After leaving college some of his proteges did quite well, oth- ers failed. Only one coiillllitted suicide. It was said that Ellsworth Toohey had exercised a beneficent influence upon them-for they never forgot him: they came to consult him on many things, years later, they wrote him, they clung to him. They were like machines without a self-starter, that had to be cranked up by an outsi(le hand. He was never too busy to give them his full atten- tion; · His life was crowded, public and impersonal as a city ·square. The friend of humanity had no single private friend. People came to him; he came close to no one. He accepted all. His affection was golden, smooth and even, like a great expanse of sand; there was no wind of discrimination to raise dunes; the sands lay still and the sun stood high. Out of his meager income he donated money to many organi- zations. He was never known to have loaned a dollar to an indi- vidual. He never asked his rich friends to assist a person in need; but he obtailie9 from them large sums and endowments for char- itable institutions: for settleme.nt houses, recreation centers, homes for fallen girls, schools for defective children. He served on th~ boards of all these institutions-without salary. A great many philanthropic undertakings and radical publications, run by all sorts of people, had a single connecting link among them, one common denominator: the name of Ellsworth M. Toohey on their stationery. He was a sort of one-man holding company of altru- ism. · Women played no part in his life. Sex had never interested him. His furtive, infrequent urges drew him to the young, slim, full-bosomed, brainless girls-the giggling little waitresses, the lisping manicurists, the less efficient s~nographers, the kind who wore pink or orchid dresses and little hats on the back of their heads with gobs of blond curls in front. He was indifferent to women of intellect. He contended that the family was a bourgeois institution; but he made no issue of it and did not crusade for free love. The sub- ject of sex bored him. There was, he felt, too much fuss made over the damn thing; it was of no importance; there were too many weightier problems in the world. 302"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The years passed, with each busy day of his life like a small, neat coiri dropped patiently into a gigantic slot machine, without a glance at the combination ~f symbols, without return. Gradu- ally, one of his many activities began to stand out among the oth- ers: he became known as an eminent critic of architecture. He wrote about buildings for three successive magazines that limped on noisily for a few years and failed, one after the other: New Voices, New Pathways, New Horizons. The fourth, New Fron- tiers, survived. Ellsworth Toohey was the only thing salvaged from the successive wrecks. Architectural criticism seemed to be a neglected field of endeavor; few people bothered to write about buildings, fewer to read. Toohey acquired a reputation and an tin- official monopoly. The better magazines began calling upon bini whenever they needed anything connected with architecture. In the year 1921 a small change occurred in Toohey's private life; his niece Catherine Halsey, the daughter of his sister Helen, · came to live with him. His father had long since died, and Aunt Adeline had vanished into the obscure poverty. of some small town; at the death of Catherine's parents there was no one else to take care of her. Toohey had not intended to keep her in his own home. But when she stepped off the train in New York, herplain little face looked beautiful for a moment, as if the future were opening before her and its glow were already upon her forehead, as if she were eager and proud and ready to meet it It was one of those rare moments when the humblest person knows sucl- denly what it means to feel as the center of the universe, and Is made beautiful by the knowledge, and the world-in the eyes of witnesses--looks like a better place for having such a center. Ellsworth Toohey saw this--and decided that Catherine would remain with him. In the year 1925 came Sermons in Stone-and. fame. Ellsworth Toohey became a fashion. Intellectual hostesses fought over him. Some people disliked him and laughed at him: But there was little satisfaction in laughing at Ellsworth Toohey, because he was always first to make the most outrageous remarks about himself. Once, at a party, a smug, boorish businessman lis- tened to Toohey's earnest social theories for a while and said. complacently: ''Well, I wouldn't know much about all that intel- lectual stuff. I play the stock market.\" \"I,\" said Toohey, \"play the stock market of the spirit. And I sell short.\" The most important consequence of Sermons in· Stone was Toohey's contract to write a daily column for Gail Wynand's New York Banner. The contract came as a surprise to the followers of both sides involved, and, at first, it made everybody angry. Toohey had re- ferred to Wynand frequently and not respectfully: the Wynand papers had called Toohey every name fit to print. But the Wynand papers had no policy, save that of reflecting the greatest 303"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"prej~dices of the greatest number, and this made for an erratic di- rection, but a recognizable direction, nev.ertheless: toward the in- consistent, the irresponsible, the trite and the maudlin. The Wynand papers stood against Privilege and for the. Common Man, but in a respectable manner that could shock 1,1obody; they exposed monopolies, when they wished; they ·supported strikes, when they wished, and vice versa. They denounced Wall Street and l;hey denounced socialism and they hollered for clean mov- ies, all with the same gusto. They were strident and blatant-and, in essence, lifelessly mild. Ellsworth Toohey was a phenomenon much too extreme to fit behind the front page of the Banner. ·But the staff of the Banner was as unfastidious as its policy. It included everybody who could.please the public or any large sec- tion thereof. It was said: \"Gail Wynand is not a pig. He'D eat anything.\" Ellsworth Toohey was a great success and the public was suddenly interested in architecture; the Banner had no au- thority on architecture; the Banner would get Ellsworth Toohey. It was a simple syllogism. . Thus ''One Stnall Voice\" came into existence. The Banner· explained its appearance by announcing: \"On Monday the Banner will present to you a new friend- ELLSWORTH M. rooHEY-whose scintillating book Sermons in Stone you have all read and loved .. The mune of Mr. Toohey stands for the great profession of architecture. He will help you to undef!ltand everything.you want to know about the wonders of modem building. Watch for 'ONE SMAll. VOICE' on Monday. To appear ~lusi:vely in the Banner in New York City.\" The rest of what Mr. Toohey. stood for was ignored. Ellsworth Toohey made no announcement or explanation to anyone. He disregarded the friends who cried that he had sold himself. He siinply went to work. He devoted \"One Small Voice\" to architecture-once a month. The rest of the time it was the vOice of Eilsworth Toot,ey saying what he wished said-to syn- dicated millions. Toohey was the. only Wynand employee who had a contract permitting. him to write anything he pleased. He had insisted upon it. It was considered a great victory, by everybody except Ellsworth Toohey. He realized that it could mean one of two things: either Wynand had surrendere<f respectfully to the pres- tige of his name-:-or Wynand considered him too contemptible to be worth restraining. \"One Small Voice\" never seemed to say anything dangerously revolutionary, and seldom anything political. It merely preached sentiments with which most people felt in agreement: unselfish- ness, brotherhood, equality. \"I'd rather be kind than right.\" ''Mercy is superior to justice, the shallow-hearted to. the contrary notwithstanding.\" \"Speaking anatomically-and perhaps otherwise-the heart is our most valuable organ. The brain is a 304"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"superstition.\" \"In spiritual matters there is a simple, infallible test: everything that proceeds from the ego is evil; everything that proceeds from love for others is good.\" \"Service is the only badge of nobility.

Let us aspire to no virtue which cannot be shared.\" \"I have yet to see a genius or a hero who, if stuck with a burning match, would feel less pain than his undistinguished avemge brother.\" \"Genius is an exaggemtion of dimension. So is elephantiasis. Both may be only a disease.\" \"We are all brothers under the skin-and I, for one, would be willing to skin human- ity to prove it.\" In the offices of the Banner Ellsworth Toohey was treated re- spectfully and left alone. It was whispered that Gail Wynand did not like him-because Wynand was always polite to him. Alvah Scarret unbent to the point of cordiality, but kept a wary distance. There was a sileQt, watchful equilibrium between Toohey and Scarret: they understood each other. · Toohey made no attempt to approach Wynand in any way.· Toohey seemed indifferent to all the men who counted on the Banner. He cmicentmted on the others, instead. He organized a club of Wynand employees. It was not a labor union; it was just a club. It met once a month in the libmry of the Banner. It did not concern itself with wages, hours or working conditions; it had no concrete progmm at all. People got ac- quainted, talked, and listened to speeches. Ellsworth· Toohey made most of the speeches. He spoke about new horizons and the press as the voice of the masses. Gail Wynand appeared at a meeting once, entering unexpectedly in the middle of a session. Toohey smiled and invited him to join the club, declaring that he was eligible. Wynand did not join. He sat listening for half an hour, yawned, got up, and left before the meeting was over. Alvah Scarret appreciated the fact that Toohey did not try to reach into his field, into the important matters of policy; As a kind of return courtesy, Scarret let Toohey recommend new em- ployees, when there was a vacancy to fill, particularly if the po- sition was not an important one; as a rule, Scarret did not care, while Toohey always cared, even when it was only the post of copy boy. Toohey's selections got the jobs. Most of them were young, bmsh, competent, shifty-eyed and shook hands limply. They had other things in common, but these were not so appar- ent. There were severn) monthly meetings which Toohey attended regularly; the meetings of: the Council of American Builders, the Council of American Writers, the Council of American Artists. He had organized them all. 305"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Lois ~ook was chairmim of the Council of American Writers. It met in the drawing roo~ of her home on the Bowery. She was the only famous member. The rest included a woman who never used capitals in her books, and a man who never used commas; a youth who had written a thousand-page novel without a single letter o, and another . who wrote poems that neither rhymed nor scanned; a Irian with a beard who was sophisticated and proved it by using every unprintable four-letter word in every ten pages of his manuscript; a woman who imitated Lois Cook, except that her style was less clear; when asked for explanations she stated . that this was the way .life sounded to her, when broken by the prism of her subconscious-\"You know what a prism does to a ray of light, (ion't you?\" she said. There was also a fierce young man known simply as Ike the Genius, though nobody knew just what .he had done, except that he talked about loving all of life. The Council signed a declaration which stated that writers were servants of tm: proletariat-but the statement did not sound as simple as that; it was more involved and much longer. The declaration was sent to every newspaper. in the country. It was never published anywhere, except on page 32 of New Frontiers. The Council of Ametican Artists had, as chairman, a cadaver- ous youth who painted what he saw in his nightly dreams. There was a boy who used no canvas, but did something with bird cages and metronomes, and another who discovered a new tech- nique of painting: he blackened a sheet of paper and then painted with a rubber eraser. There was a stout middle-aged lady who drew subconsciously, claiming that she never looked at her hand and had no idea of what the hand was doing; her hand, she said, was guided by the spirit of the departed lover whom she had never met on earth. Here they did not talk so much about the pro- letariat, but merely rebelled against the tyranny of reality and of the objective. A few friends pointed out to Ellsworth Toohey that he seemed guilty of inconsistency; he was so deeply opposed to individual- ism, they said, and here were all these writers and artists of his, and every one of them was a rabid individualist. \"Do you really think so?'' said Toohey, smiling blandly. · Nobody took these Councils seriously. People talked about them, because they thought it made good conversation; it was such a huge joke, they said, certainly there was no harm in any of it. \"Do you really think so?\" said Toohey. Ellsworth Toohey was now forty-one years old. He lived in a distinguished apartment that seemed modest when compared to the size of the income he could have commanded if he wished. He liked to apply the adjective \"conservative\" to himself in one respect only: in his conservative good taste for clothes. No one had ever seen him lose his temper. His manner was immutable; it was the same in a drawing room, at a labor meeting, on a lec- 306"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"ture platfonn, in the bathroom or during sexual intercourse: cool, self-possessed, amused, faintly patronizing. People admired his sense of humor. He was. they said, a man who could laugh at himself. \"I'm a dangerous person.

Of all the many titles bestowed upon him. he preferred one: Ellsworth Toohey, the Humanitarian. 10 1im EmuaHT HousE was opened in June of 1929. There was no formal ceremony. But Roger Enright wanted to mark the moment for his own satisfaction. He invited a few peo- ple he liked and he unlocked the great glass entrance· door, throwing it open to the sun-filled air. Some press photographers had arrived, because the stOry concerned Roger Enright and be- cause Roger Enright did not want tobave them there. He ignored them .. He stood in the middle of the street, looking at the build- ing, then he walked through the l~bby, stopping sholt without reason and resuming his pacing. He said nothing. He frowned fiercely, as ·if he were about to scream with rage. His friends knew that Roger Enright was happy;. The.bliilding stood on the shore of the East River, a structure rapt as raised arms. The rock crystal forms· mounted in such el- oquent steps that the building did not seem stationary, but mov- ing upward in a continuous flow-4mtil one realized that it was only the movement of one's glance and that one\"s glance was forced to move in that particular rhythm. The walls of pale gray limestone looked silver against the sky, with the clean, dulled luster of metal, but a metal that had become a warm, living sub- stance, carved by the most cutting of all instruments-'-ll purpose- ful human will. It made the house alive in a strange, personal way of its own, so that in the minds of spectators five words ran dimly, without object or clear connection: \" ... in His image and, likeness ... \" A young photographer from the Banner noticed Howard Roark standing alone across the street, at the parapet of the river. He was leaning back, his hands closed over the parapet, hatless, looking up at the building. It was an accidental, unconscious mo- ment. The young photographer glanced at Roark's face-and thought of something that had puzzled him for a long time: he had always wondered why the sensations one felt in dreams were so much more intense than anything one could experience in waking reality-why the horror was so total and the ecstasy so complete-and what was that extra quality which could never be 307"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"recaptured afterward; the quality of what be felt when be walked down a path through tangled green leaves in a dream, in an air full of expectation, of causeless, utter rapture--and when be awakened he could not explain it, it bad been jJJst a path through some woods. He thought of that because he saw that extra quality for the frrst time in waking existence, he saw it in Roark's face lifted to the building. The photographer was a young boy, new to his job; be did not know much about it; but he loved his work; he had been an amateur photographer since childhood. So he snapped a picture of Roark in that one moment. Later the Art Editor of the Banner saw the picture and barked: \"What the hell's that?\" \"Howard Roark,\" said the photographer. ''Who's Howard Roark?\" ''The architect.\" \"Who the hell wants a picture of the architect?\" ''Well, I only thought ... \" \"Besides, it's crazy. What's the matter with the man?\" So the picture was thrown into the morgue. The· Enright House rented promptly. The tenants who moved in were people who wanted to live in sane comfort and cared about not:biJ.m else. They did not discuss the value of the build- ing; they merely liked living there. They were the sort who lead useful, active private lives in public silence. But others talked a great deal of the Enright House, for about three weeks. They said that it was preposterous, exhibitionist and phony. They said: ''My dear, imagine inviting Mrs. Moreland if you lived in a place like that! And her home is in such good taste!\" A Jew were beginning to appear who said: \"You know, I rather like modem architecture, there are some mighty interesting things being done that way nowadays, there's quite a school of it in Germany that's rather remarkabl&-but this is not like it at all. This is a freak.\" Ellsworth Toohey never mentioned the Enright House in his column. A reader of the Banner wrote to him: \"Dear Mr. Toohey: What do you think of this place they call the Enright House? I have a friend who is an interior decorator and he talks a lot about it and he says it's lousy. Architecture and such various arts being my hobby, I don't know what to think. Will you tell us in your column?\" Ellsworth Toohey answered in a private letter: \"Dear friend: There are so many important buildings and great events going on in the world today that I cannot devote my col- umn to trivialities.\" But people came to Roark-the few he wanted. That winter, he had received a commission to build the Norris bouse, a mod- est country home. In May he signed another contract-for his first office building, a fifty-story skyscraper in the center of Man- hattan. Anthony Cord. the owner, had come fwm nowhere and made a fortune in Wall Street within· a few brilliant, violent years. He wanted a building of his own and he went to Roark. Roark's office had grown to four rooms. His staff loved him. 308"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"They did not realize it and would have been shocked to apply such a term as love to their cold, unapproachable, inhuman boss. These were the words they used to describe Roark, these were the words they had been trained to use by all the standards and conceptions of their past; only, working with him,' they knew that he was none of these things,· but they could not explain, neither what he was nor what they felt for him. He did not smile at his employees, he did not take them out for drinks, he never inquired about their families, their love lives or their church attendance. He responded only to the essence of a man: to Ills creative capacity. In this office one had to be compe- tent. There were no alternatives, no mitigating considerations . . But if a man worked well, he needed nothing else to win .his em- ployer's benevolence: it was granted, not as a gift, but as a debt. It was granted, not as affection, but as recognition. It bred an im- mense feeling of self-respect within every man in that office. \"Oh, but that's not human,\" said somebody when one of Roark's draftsmen tried to explain this at home, \"such a cold, in- tellectual approach!\" One boy, a younger sort of Peter Keating, tried to introduce the human in preference to the intellectual in Roark's office; he did not last two weeks. Roark made mistakes in choosing his employees occasionally, not often; those whom he kept for a month became his friends for life. They did not call themselves friends; they did not praise him to outsiders; they did not talk about him. They knew only, in a dim way, that it was not loyalty to him, but to the best within themselves. Dominique remained in the city all summer. She remembered, with bitter pleasure, her custom to travel; it made her angry to think that she could not go, could not want to go. She enjoyed the anger; it drove her to his room. On the nights which she did not spend with him she walked through the streets of the city. She walked to the Enright House or to the Fargo Store, and stood looking at the building_ for a long time. She drove alone out of town-to_ see the Heller house, the Sanborn house, the Gowan Service Station. She never spoke to him about that. Once, she took the Staten Island ferry at two o'clock in the morning; she rode .to the island, standing alone at the rail of an empty deck. She watched the city moving away from her. In the vast emptiness of sky and ocean, the city was only a small, jagged solid. It seemed condensed, pressed tight together, not a place of streets and separate buildings, but a single sculptured form. A form of irregular steps that rose and dropped· without ordered continuity, long ascensions and sudden drops, like the graph of a stubborn struggle. But it went on mounting-toward a few points, toward the triumphant masts of skyscrapers raised out of the struggle. 309"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"The boat went past the Statue of.

She liked to lie with him .at the edge of the water; she would lie on her stomach, a few feet away from him; facing the shore, her toes stretched to the waves; she would not. touch him, but she would ' feet· the waves coming up behind them, breaking against their bodies, and· she would see the backwash running in mingled streams off her body and his. They spent the nights at some country inn, taking a single room. They never spoke of the things left behind them in the city. But it was the unstated that gave meaning to the relaxed simplicity of these hours; their eyes laughed silently at the pre- posterous contract whenever they looked at each other. She tried to demonstrate her power over him. She stayed away from his house; she waited for him to come to her. He spoiled it by coming too soon; by refusing her the satisfaction of knowing that he waite(~ and struggled against his desire; by surrendering at once. She would say: \"Kiss my hand, Roark.\" He would kneel and kiss her ankle. He defeated her by admitting her power; she could not have the gratification of enforcing it He would lie at her feet, he would say: \"Of course I need you. I go insane when I see you. You can do almost anything you wish with me. Is that 310"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"what you want· to hear? Almost, Dominique. And the things you couldn't make me do-you could put me through hell if you de- manded them and I had to refuse you, as I would. Through utter hell, Dominique. Does that please you? Why !_lo you want to know whether you own me? It's so simple. Of course you do. All ·· of me that can be owned. You'll never demand anything else. But you want to know whether you could make me suffer. You could. What of it?'' The words did not sound like surrender, because. they were not tom out of him, but admitted simply and willingly. She felt no thrill of conquest; she felt herself owned more than ever, by a man who could say these things, know of them to be true, and still remain controlled and controlling-es she wanted him to remain. Late in June a man named Kent Lansing came to see Roark. He was forty years old, he. was dressed like a fashion plate and looked like a prize fighter, though he was not burly, muscular or tough: he was thin and angular; He merely made one think ·of a boxer and of other things.that did not.fit his appearance: of a.bat- tering ram, of a tank, of a submarine torpedo. He was a member of a corporation formed for the purpose -of erecting a luxurious hotel on Central Park South. There were many wealthy men. in- volved and the corporation was ruled by a numerous board; they had purchased their site; they had not decided on an architect. But Kent Lansing had made up his mind that· it would~ Roatk. \"I won't try to tell you how much I'd like to do it,\" Roark said to him ·at the end of their first interview. ''But there's not a chance of my getting it. I can get along with people-when they're alone. I can do nothing with them in groups~ ·No board has ever hired me-and I don't think one ever will.\" Kent Lansing smiled. \"Have you ever known a board to do- anything?'' ''What do you mean?\" . \"Just that: have you ever known a board to do anything- at all?'' . . ' ''Well, they seem to exist and function.\" \"Do they? You know; there was a time when everyone thought it self-evident that the earth was flat. It would be entertaining to speculate upon the nature and causeS of humanity's illusions. I'll write a book about it\" some day. It won't be popular. I'll have a chapter on boards of directors. You see, they don't exist.\" \"I'd like to believe you, but what's the gag?'' · \"No, you wouldn't like to believe me. The causes of illusions are not pretty to discover. They're either vicious· or tragic. This one is both. Mainly vicious. And it's not a gag. But we won't go into that now. All I mean is that a board of difectors is one or two ambitious• men-and a lot of ballast. I mean that groups of men are vacuums. Great big empty nothings. They say we can't 311"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"visualize a total nothing; Hell, sit at any committee meeting. The point is only who chooses to fill that nothing. It's a tough battle.

You've fought a vacuum all your life.\" · \"I'm looking at you like that because I like you.\" . \"Of course you like me. As I knew I'd like you. Men are brothers, you know, and they have a great instinct for brotherhood-except in boards, unions, corporations and other chain gangs. But I talk too much. That's why I'm a good sales- man. However, I have nothing to sell you. You know. So we'll just say that you're going to build the Aquitania-that's the name of our hotel-and we'll let it go at that.\" If the violence of the battles which people never hear about could be measured in material statistics, the battle of Kent Lan- sing against the board of directors of the Aquitania Corpomtion would have been listed among the greatest carnages of history. But the things he fought were not solid eno\\lgh to leave anything as substantial as corpses on the battlefield. He had to fight phenomena such as: \"Listen, Palmer, Lansing's talking about somebody named Roark, how're you going to vote, do the big boys approve of him or not?\" \"I'm not going to decide till I know who's voted foroi against.\" \"Lansing says ... but on the other hand, Thorpe tells me ... \" \"Talbot's putting up a swank .hotel on Fifth up in the sixties-and he's got Francon & Keating.\" \"Harper swears by this young fellow-Gordon Pres- cott.\" \"Listen, Betsy says we're crazy.\" \"I don't like Roark's face-be doesn't look co-operative.\" \"I know, I feel it, Roark's the kind that don't fit in. He's not a regular fellow.\" \"What's a regular fellow?\" \"Aw hell, you know very well what I mean: reg- ular.\" \"Thompson says that Mrs. Pritchett says that she knows for certain because Mr. Macy told her that if ... \" \"Well, boys, I don't give a.damn what anybody says, I make up my own mind, and I'm here to tell you that I think this Roark is lousy. I don.'t like the Enright House.\" \"Why?\" \"I don't know why. I just don't like it, and that's that. Haven't I got a right to an opinion of my ownT' The battle lasted for weeks. Everybody had his say, except Roark. Lansing told him: \"It's all right. Lay off. Don't do any- thing. Let me do the talking. There's nothing you can do. When facing society, the man most concerned, the man who is to do the most and contribute the most, has the least say. It's taken· for gmnted that he has no voice and the reasons he could offer are rejected in advance as prejudiced-since no speech is ever con- sidered, but only the speaker. It's so much easier to pass judg- ment on a man than on an idea. Though how in hell one passes judgment on a man without considering the content of his brain 312"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"is more than I'll ever understand- However. dult's how it's done. You see, reasons require scales to weigh them. And scales are not made of cotton. And cott,on is what the human spirit is made of- you know, the stuff that keeps no shape and offeis no resistance and can be twisted forward and backward and into a pretzel. You could tell them why they should hire you so very much better than I could. But they won't ljsten to you and they'll listen to me. Be- cause I'm the middleman. The shortest distance between two points is not a straight line--it's a middleman. And the more middlemen, the shorter. Such is the psychology of a pretzel.\" ''Why are you fighting for me like thatT' Roark asked. ''Why are you a good architect? Because you have certain standardS of what is good, and they're your own, and you stand by them. I . want a good hotel, and I have certain standilrds of what is good, and they're my own, and you're the one who can give me what I want. And when I fight for you, I'm doing-on my side of it-just what you're doing when you design a build- ing. Do you think integrity is the monopoly of ~ artist? And what, incidentally, do you think integrity is? The ability .not· to pick a _watch out of your neighbor's pocket? No, it's not as easy as that. H that were all, I'd say nin~-five percent ofhumanity were honest, upright men. Only, as you can see, they aren't. In- tegrity is the ability to stand by an idea.. That presupposes the ability to think. Thinking is something one doesn't borrow or pawn. And yet, if I were asked to choose a symbolfor humanity as we.know it, I wouldn't choose~ cross nor lin eagle nor a lion and unicorn. I'd choose three gilded balls.\" · And as Roark looked at him, he added: \"Dori't wony. They're all against me. But I have one advantage: they don't know what they want.l do.\" . _ At the end of July, Roark signed a contract to build the Aquitania. Ellsworth Toohey sat in his office, looking at a newspaper -\" spread out on his desk, at the item announcing the Aquitania con- tract. He smoked, holding a cigarette propped in the comer of his mouth, supported by tWO S.traight fingers; one finger tapped against the cigarette, slowly, rhythmically, for a long time. He heard the sound of his door thrown open, and he glanced up. to see Dominique standing there, leaning against the door- jamb, her arms crossed on her chest. Her face looked interested, nothing more, but it was alarming to see an expression of actual interest on her face. \"My dear,\" he said, rising, \"this is the- first time you've taken the trouble to enter my office-in the·. four years that we've worlred in the same building. This is really an occasion.\" _ She llaid nothing, but smiled gently, which was. still more alarming. He added, his voice pleasant: \"My little speech, of 313"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"course, was the equivalent of a question. Or don't we understand each other any longer?\" \"I suppose we don't~if you find it necessary to ask what brought me here. But you know it, Ellsworth, you know it; there it is on your desk.\" She walked to the desk and flipped a corner of the newspaper. She laughed. \"Do you wish you had it hidden somewhere? Of course you didn't expect me to come. Not that it makes any difference. But I just like to see you being obvious for once. Right on your desk, like that. Open at the real-estate page, too.\" \"You sound as if that little piece of news had made you happy.\" \"It did, Ellsworth. It does.\" \"I thought you had worked hard to prevent that contract.\" \"I had.\" \"If you think this is an act you're putting on right now, Do- minique, you're fooling yourself. This isn't an act.\" 1 \"No, Ellsworth. This isn't.\" \"You're happy that Roark got it?\" \"I'm so happy. I could sleep with this Kent Lansing, whoever he is, if I ever met him and if he asked me.\" \"'Iben the pact is off?\" \"By no means. I shall try to stop any job that comes his way. I shall continue trying. It's not going to be so easy as it was, though. The Enright House, the Cord Building-and this. Not so easy for me-and for you. He's beating you, Ellsworth. Ellsworth, what if we were wrong about the world, you and I?\" \"You've always been, my dear. Do forgive me. I should have known better than to be astonished. It would make you happy, of course, that he got it. I don't even mind admitting that it doesn't make me happy at all There, you see? Now your visit to my of- fice has been a complete success. So we shall just write the Aquitania off as a major defeat, forget all about it and continue as we were.\" · \"Certainly, Ellsworth. Just as we were. I'm cinching a beauti- ful new hospital for Peter Keating at a dinner party tonight.\" Ellsworth Toohey went home and spent the evening thinking about Hopton Stoddard. Hopton Stoddard was a little man worth twenty million dol- lars. Three inheritances had contributed to that sum, and seventy- two years of a busy life devoted to the purpose of making money. Hopton Stoddard had a genius for investment;. he invested in everything-houses of ill fame, Broadway spectacles on the grand scale, prefe{llbly of a religious nature, factories, farm mort- gages and contraceptives. He was small and bent. His face was not disfigured; people merely thought it was, because it had a single expression: he smiled. His little mouth was shaped like a v in eternal good cheer; his eyebrows were tiny v's inverted over 314"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"round, blue eyes; his hair, rich, white. and waved, looked like a wig, but was real. Toohey had known Hopton Stoddard for many years and exer- cised a strong influence upon him. Hopton Stoddard had never married, had no relatives and no friends; he distrusted people, be- lieving that they were always after his money. But he felt a tre- mendous respec~ for Ellsworth Toohey, because Toohey represented the exact opposite of hi~ own life; Toohey had no conceOJ whatever for worldly wealth; by the mere fact of this contrast, he considered Toohey the personification of virtue; what this estimate implied in regard to his own life never quite oc-. curred t0 him. He was not easy in his mind about his life, and the uneasiness grew with the years, with the certainty of an ap- proaching end. He found relief ·in religion-in the form of a bribe. He experimented with several different creeds, attended services, donated large sums and switched to another faith. As the years passed, the tempo of his quest accelerated; it had the tone of panic. · Toohey's indifference to religion was the only flaw that dis- turbed him in the person of his friend and mentor. But everything Toohey preached seemed in line with God's law: charity, sacri-. flee, help to the poor. Hopton Stoddard felt safe whenever he fol- lowed Toohey's advice. He .<Jonated handsomely to the institutions recommended by Toohey, without much prompting. In matters of the spirit he regarded Toohey upon earth soll)ewhat as he expected to regard God in heaven. But this summer Toohey met defeat with Hopton Stoddard for the first time. Hopton Stoddard decided to realize a dream which he had been planning slyly and cautiously, like all his other investments, for several years: he decided to build a temple. It was not tO be the temple of any particlilar creed, but an interdenominational, non-sectarian monument to religion, a cathedral of faith, open to all. Hopton Stoddard wanted to play safe. He felt crushed when Ellsworth T09hey advised him against the project. Toohey wanted a building to house a new home for subnormal children; he had an organization· set up, a distin- guished committee of sponsors, an endowment for operating expenses-but no building and no funds to erect one. H Hopton Stoddard wished a worthy memorial to his name, a grand climax of his generosity, to what nobler pmpose could he dedicate his money than to the Hopton Stoddard Home for Sqbnormal Chil- dren, Toohey pointed out to him emphatically; to the poor little blighted ones for whom nobody cared. But Hopton Stoddard could not be aroused to any enthusiasm for a Home nor for any m1,1ndane institution. It had to be \"The .Hopton Stoddard Temple of the Human SpiriL\" He could offer no arguments against Toohey's brilliant array; 315"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"he could say nothing except: ''No, Ellsworth, no, it's not right, not right.\" The matter was left unsettled. Hopton Stoddard would not budge, but Toohey's disapproval made him uncomfortable and he postponed his decision from day to day. He knew only that he would have to decide by the end of summer, because in the fall he was to depart on a long journey, a world tour of the holy shrines of all faiths, from Lourdes to Jerusalem to Mecca to Benares. A few days after. the announcement of the Aquitania contract Toohey came to see Hopton Stoddard, in the evening, in the pri- vacy of Stoddard's vast, overstuffed apartment on Riverside Drive. \"Hopton,\" he said cheerfully, \"I was wrong. You were right about that temple.\" \"No!\" said Hopton Stoddard, aghast. \"Yes,\" said Toohey, \"you were right. Nothing else would be quite fitting. You must build a temple. A Temple of the Human Spirit.\" Hopton Stoddard swallowed, and his blue eyes became moist. He felt that he must have progressed far upon the path of righ- teousness if he had been able to teach a point of virtue to his teacher. After that, nothing else mattered; he sat, like a meek, wrinkled baby, listening to Ellsworth Toohey, nodding, agreeing to everything. \"It's an ambitious undertaking, Hopton, and if you do it, you must do it right. It's a little presumptuous, you know-offering a present to God-and unless you do it in the best way possible, it. will be offensive, not reverent.\" \"Yes, of course. It must be right. It must be right. It must be the best. You'll help me, won't you, Ellsworth? You know all about buildings and art and everything-it must be right.\" \"I'll be glad to help you, if you really want me to.\" \"If I want you to! What do you mean-if I want ... ! Good- ness gracious, what would I do without you? I don't know any- thing about ... about anything like that. And it must be right.\" \"If you want it right, will you do exactly as I say?\" \"Yes. Yes. Yes, of course.\" \"First of all, the architect. That's very important.\" \"Yes, indeed.\" \"You don't want one of those satin-lined commercial boys with the dollar sign all over them. You want a man who believes in his work as-as you believe in God.\" \"That's right. That's absolutely right.\" \"You must take the one I name.\" \"Certainly. Who's that?\" \"Howard Roark.\" \"Huh?\" Hopton Stoddard looked blank. \"Who's he?\" 316"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"\"He's the man who's going to build the Temple of the Human Spirit.\" \"Is he any good?\" Ellsworth Toohey turned and looked straight into his eyes. \"By my immortal soul, Hopton,\" he said slowly, \"he's the best there is.\" · · \"Oh! ... \" \"But he's difficult to get. He doesn't work except on certain conditions. You must observe them scrupulously. You must give him complete freedom. Tell him what you want and how much you want to spend, and leave the rest up to him. ·Let him design it and build it as he wishes. He won't work otherwise. Just tell him frankly that you know nothing about architecture and that you chose him because you felt he was the only one who could be trusted to do it right without advice or interference.\" \"Okay, if you vouch for him.\" \"I vouch for him.\" \"That's fine. And I don't care how inuch it costs me.\" \"But you must be careful about .approaching him. 1 think he will refuse to do it, at first. He will tell you that he doesn'tbe- lieve in God.\" \"What!\" \"Don't believe him. He's a profoundly religious man-ID his own way. You can see that in his buildings.\" ' \"Oh.\" \"But he doesn't belong to any established church. So you won't appear partial. You won't offend anyone.\" \"That's good.\" \"Now, when you deal in matters of faith, you must be the first , · one to have faith. Is that right?\" \"That's right.\" · \"Don't wait to see his drawings. They will take some time- and you.mustn't delay your trip. Just hire him-don't sign a con- tract, it's not necessary-make arrangements for your bank to take care of the financial end and let him do the rest. You don't have to pay him his fee until you return. In a year or so, when you come back after seeing all those great temples, you'll have a better one of your own, waiting here for you.\" \"Ttiat's just what I wanted.\" \"But you must think of the proper unveiling to the public, the proper dedication, the right publicity.\" · \"Of course ... That is, .publicity?\" \"Certainly. Do you know of any great event that's not accom- pained by a good publicitY campaign? One that isn't, can't be much. If you skimp on that, it will be downright disrespectful.\" \"That's true.\" \"Now if you want the proper publicity, you must plan it care- fully, well in advance. What you want, when you unveil it, is one 317"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"grand fanfare, like an opera overture, like a blast on Gabriel's hom.\" \"That's beautiful, the way 'you put it.\" \"Well, to do that you mustn't allow a lot of newspaper punks to dissipate your effect by dribbling out premature stories. Don't release the drawings of the temple. Keep them secret. Tell Roark that yo~ want them kept secret. He won't object to that. Have the contractor put up a solid fence all around the site while it's being built. No one's to know what it's like until you come back and preside at the unveiling in person: Then-pictures in every damn paper in the country!\" \"Ellsworth!\" \"I beg your pardon.\" \"The idea's right. That's how we put over The Legend of the Virgin, ten years ago that was, with a cast of ninety-seven.\" \"Yes. But in the meantime, keep the public interested. Get yourself a good press agent and tell him how you want it han- dled. I'll give you the name of an excellent one. See to it that there's something aboUt the mysterious Stoddard Temple in the papers every other week or·so. Keep ~em guessing. Keep 'em waiting. They'll be good and ready when the time comes.'' ''Right.\" \"But, above all, don't let Roark know that I· recommended him; Don't bieathe a word to anyone about my having anything to do with it. Not to a soul. Swear it.\" \"But why?'' \"Because I have too many friends who are architects, and it's such an important commission, and I don't want to hurt any- body's feelings.\" \"Yes. That's true.\" \"Swear it.\" \"Oh., Ellsworth!\" \"Swear it. By the salvation of your soul.\" \"I swear it. By , .. that.\" \"All right . .Now you've never dealt with architects, IUld he's an unusual kind of architect, and you don't want to muff it. So I'll tell you exactly what you're to say to him.\" On the following day Toohey walked into Dominique's office. He stood at her desk, smiled and said, his voice unsmiling: \"Do you retnember Hopton Stoddard and that temple of all faith that he's been talking about for six years?'' \"Vaguely.\" \"He's going to build it.\" \"Is he?'' . \"He's giving the job to Howard Roark.\" \"Not really!\" \"Really.\". \"Well, of all the incredible ... Not Hopton!\" 318"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"\"Hopton.\" \"Oh, all right. I'll go to work on him.\" \"No. You lay off. I told him to give it to Roark.\" She sat still, exactly as the words caught her, the amusement gone from her face. He added: \"I wanted you to know that I did it, so there won't be any tac- tical contradictions. No one else knows it or is to know it. I trust you to remember that.\" She asked, her lips moving tightly: \"What are you after?\" He smiled. He. said: \"I'm going to make him famous.\" Roark sat in Hopton Stoddard's office and listened, stupefied. Hopton Stoddard spoke slowly; it sounded earnest and impres- sive, but was due to the fact that he had memorized his speeches almost verbati(n. His baby eyes looked at Roark with an ingrati- ating plea. For once, Roark almost forgot architecture and placed the human element first; he wanted to get up and get out of the office; he could not stand the man. But the words he heard held him; the words did not match the man's face or voice. \"So you see, Mr. Roark, though it is to be a religious edifice, it is also more than that. You notice that we call it the Temple of the Human Spirit. We want to captur~in stone, as others cap- ture in music-not some narrow creed, but the essence of all re-- ligion. And what is the essence of religion? The great aspiration of the human spirit toward the highest, the noblest, the best. The human spirit as the creator and the conqueror of the ideal. The great life-giving force of the universe. The heroic human spirit. That is your assignment, Mr. Roark.\" Roark rubbed the back of his hand against his eyes, helplessly. It was not- possible. It simply was not possible. That could not be what the man wanted; not that man. It seemed horrible to hear him say that. \"Mr. Stoddard, I'm afraid you've made a mistake,\" he said, his voice slow and tired. \"I don't think I'm the man you want. I don't think it would be right for me to undertake it. I don't be- lieve in God.\" He was astonished to see Hopton Stoddard's expression of de- light and triumph. Hopton Stoddard glowed in appreciation-in appreciation of the clairvoyant wisdom of Ellsworth Toohey who was always right. He drew himself up with new confidence, and he said firmly, for the first time in the tone of an old man ad- dressing a youth, wise and gently patronizing: ''That doesn't matter. You're a profoundly religious man, Mr. Roark-in your own way. I can see that in your buildings.\" He wondered why Roark stared at him .like that, without mov- ing, for such a long time. ''That'-s true,\" said Roark. It was almost a whisper. 319"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"That he should learn something about himself, about his. build- ings, from this man who had seen it and known it before he knew it, that this man should say it with that air of tolerant con- fiden~ i~plying full understanding-removed Roark's doubts. He told himself that he did not really understand people; that an impression could be deceptive; that Hopton, Stoddard would be far on another continent away; that nothing mattered in the face of such an assignment; that nothing could matter when a human voice-even Hopton Stoddard's--was going on, saying: \"I wish to call it God. You may choose any other name. But what I want in that building is your spirit Your spirit, Mr. Roark. Give me the best of that-and you· will have done your job, as I shall have done mine. DO not worry about the meaning I wish conveyed.· Let it be your spirit in the shape of a building-and it will have that meaning, whether you know it or not\" And so Roark agreed to build the Stoddard Temple of the Hu- man Spirit · 11 IN DECEMBER the Cosmo-Slotnick Building was opened with great ceremony. There were celebrities, flower horseshoes, news- reel cameras, revolving searchlights and three hours of speeches, all alike. I should be happy, Peter Keating told himself-and wasn't He watched from ·a window the solid spread of faces filling Broad- way from curb to curb; He tried to talk himself into joy. He felt nothing. He had to admit that he was bored. But he smiled and shook hands and let hiQtself be photographed. The Cosmo- Slotnick Building rose ponderously over the street, like a big ·white bromide. After the ceremonies Ellsworth Toohey took Keating away to the retreat of a· pale-orchid booth in a quiet, expensive restaurant. Many brilliant parties were being given in honor of the opening, but Keating grQped Toohey's offer and declined all the other in- vitations. Toohey watched him as he seized his drink and slumped in his seat. ''Wasn't it grandT' said Toohey. \"That, Peter, is the climax of what you can expect from life.\" He lifted his glass delicately. \"Here's to the hope that you shall have many triumphs such as this. Such as tonight\" . ''Thanks,\" said Keating, and reached for. his glass hastily, with- out looking, and lifted it, to find it empty. \"Don't you feel proud, PeterT' \"Yes. Yes, of course.\" ''That's good. That's how I like to see you. You looked ~x- 320"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"tremely handsome tonight. You'll be splendid in those news- reels.\" · A flicker of interest snapped in Keating's eyes. \"Well, I sure hope so.\" \"ICs too bad you're not married, Peter. A wife would have been most decorative tonight. Goes well with the public. With the movie audiences; too.\" \"Katie doesn't photograph well.\" \"Oh, that's right, you're engaged to Katie. So stupid of me. I keep forgetting it. No, Katie doesn't photograph well at all. Also, for the life of me, I can't imagine Katie being very effective at a .social function. There are a great many nice adjectives one could use about Katie, but 'poised' and 'distinguished' are not among them. You must forgive me, Peter. I let my imagination run away with me. Dealing with art as much as I do, I'm inclined to see things purely from the viewpoint of artistic fitness. And looking at you tonight, I couldn't help thinking of the woman who would have made such a perfect picture by your side.\" \"Who?\" \"Oh, don't P.ay attention to me. It's only an esthetic fancy. Life is never as perfect as that. P.eople have too much to envy you for. You couldn't add that to your other achievements.\" \"Who?\" \"Drop it, Peter. You can't get her. Nobody can get her. You're good, but you're not good enough for that.\" \"Who?\" \"Dominique Francon, of course.\" Keating sat up straight and Toohey saw wariness in his eyes, rebellion, actual hostility. Toohey held his glance calmly. It was Keating who gave in; he slumped again and he said, pleading: \"Oh, God, Ellsworth, I don't love her.\" \"I never thought you did. But I do keep forgetting- the exagger- ated importance which the average man attaches to love-sexual love.\" \"I'm not an average man,\" said Keating wearily; it was an au- .tomatic protest-without fire. \"Sit up, Peter. You don't look like a hero, slumped that way.\" Keating jerked himself up-anxious and angry. He said: \"I've always felt that you wanted me to marry Dominique. Why? What's it to you?\" \"You've answered your own question, Peter. What could it pos- sibly be to me? But we were speaking of love. S(fxual love, Peter, is a profoundly selfish emotion. And selfish emotions are not the ones that lead to happiness. Are they? Take tonight for instance. That was an evening to swell an egotist's heart. Were you happy, Peter? Don't bother, my dear, no answer is required. The point I wish to make is only that one must mistrust one's most personal impulses. What one desires is actually of so little importance! One 321"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"can't expect to find happiness until one realizes this completely; Think of tonight for a momenl You, my dear Peter, were the least important person there. Which is as it should be. It is not the doer that counts but those for whom things are done. But you were not able to accept that-and so you didn't feel the great elation that should have been yours.\" \"That's true,\" whispered Keating.

Only when you learn to deny your ego, completely, only when you learn to be amused by such piddling sentimentalities as your lit- tle sex urges-only then will.you achieve the greatness which I have always expected of you.\" \"You ... you believe that about me, Ellsworth? You really do?\" \"I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't. But to come back to love. Personal love, Peter, is a great evil-as everything personal. And it always leads to misery. Don't you see why?

All. of us?\" \"Of course,\" said Toohey. Keating wondered why the thought was so warinly pleasant to him. He did not mind that this made him the equal of every pick- pocket in the crowd gathered to celebrate his building tonight; it oceurred to him dimly-and left him undisturbed, even though it contradicted the passionate quest for superiority that had driven him all his life: The contradiction did not matter; be was not thinking of tonight nor of the crowd; be was thinking of a man who bad not been there tonight. \"You know, Ellsworth,\" be said, leaning forward, happy in an uneasy kind of way, ••1 ...

Athelstan Beasely, the leading spirit of its organization, had had what he called a 322"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"stroke of genius: all the architects were invited to come dressed as their best buildings. It was a huge success. Peter Keating was the star of the evening .. He looked wonder- ful as the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. An exact papier-miche rep- lica of his famous structure covered him from head to knees; one could not see his face, but his bright eyes peered from behind the windows of the. top floor; and the crowning pyramid of the roof rose over his head; the colonnade hit him somewhere about. the diaphragm, and he wagged a finger: through the _portals_ of the . great enQ:ance doo.r. His legs were fiee to move with his usual el- egance, in faultless dress trorisers and patent-leather pumps. Guy Francon was ver:y impressive as the Frink National Bank Building, although the structure looked a little squatter than in the origmfd, in. order to allow for Francon's stomach; the Hadrian torch over his head had a real electric bulb fit by a miniature bat- ter:y. Ralston Holcombe was magnificent as a state capitol, and Gordon L; Prescott was ver:y mascliline as a.grain elevator. Eu- gene Pettingill waddled about on his skint),y~ · anciellt leg$, smllll and bent, an imposing Park Avenue hotel, with hom-rlmined spectacles pe~ring from under the majestic towe.r. 1\\vo wits en~ gaged in_ a duel, bgtting each other in the belly with famouS spires, great landmarks of the city that greet the ships aPJ)roach- ing from across the ocean. Ever:ybody had lots of filil. Many of the architects, Athelstan Beaselyin parti~ular, ~om­ mented resentfully on Howard Roark who h!ld been invited and did not come. They had expected to see him dressed as the Enright House. Dominique stopped in the hall and stood looking at the door, at the inscription: \"HOWARD ROARK, ARCHITECI'.\" . ·She had never seen his office. She had fought against coming here for a long time. But s~e had to see the place where he worked. · ·· · · The secretar:y in the reception room was startled when Do- minique gave her name, but announeed the visitor to Roark. \"Go right m, Miss Francon,'' she said. · · Roark smiled when she entered his office; a faint smile with- out surprise. \"I knew you'd come here some day;'\"he said. \"Want me to show you the place?\" \"What's that?\" she asked. His hands were smeared with clay; on a long table, among a litter of unfinished sketches, stood the clay model of a building, a rough study of angles and terraces. · \"The Aquitania?\" she asked. He nodded. ''Do you always do that?\" \"No. Not always. Sometimes. There's a hard problem here. I 323"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"like to play with it for a while. It will probably be my favorite building-it's so difficult.\" \"Go ahead. I want to watch you doing that. Do you mind?\" \"Not at all.\" In a moment, he had forgotten her presence. She sat in a cor- ner and watched his hands. She saw them molding walls. She saw them smash a part of the structure, and begin again, slowly, patiently, with a strange certainty even in his hesitation. She saw the palm of his hand .smooth a long, straight plane, she saw an angle jerked across the space in the motion of his hand before she saw it in clay. She rose and walked to the window. The buildings of the city far below looked no bigger than the model on his table. It seemed to her that she could see his hands shaping the setbacks, the comers, the roofs of all the structures below, smashing and molding again. Her hand moved absently, following the form of a distant building in rising steps, feeling a physical sense of pos- session, feeling it for him. She turned back to the ta'})le. A, strand of hair hung down over his face bent attentively to the model; he was not looking at her, he was looking at the shape under his fingers. It was almost as if she were watching his hands moving over the body of another woman. She leaned against the wall, weak with a feeling of vi- olent, physical pleasure. · At the beginning of January, while the first steel columns rose from the excavations that were to become the Cord Building and the Aquitania Hotel, Roark worked on the drawings for the Tem- ple. · When the first sketches were finished, he said to his secretary: \"Get me Steve Mallory.\" \"Mallory, Mr. Roark? Who ... Oh, yes, the shooting sculptor.\" \"The what?\" \"He took a shot at Ellsworth Toohey, didn't he?\" \"Did he? Yes, that's right.\" \"Is that the one you want, Mr. Roark?\" \"That's the one.\" For two days the secretary telephoned art dealers, galleries, ar- chitects, newspapers. No one could tell her what had become of Steven Mallory or where he could be found. On the third day she reported to Roark: \"I've found an address, in the Village, which I'm told might be his. There's no telephone.\" Roark dictated a letter asking Mallory to telephone his office. The letter was not returned, but a week passed without answer. Then Steven Mallory telephoned. \"Hello?\" said Roark, when the secretary switched the call to him. 324"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"\"Steven Mallory speaking,\" said a young, hard voice, in a way that left an impatient, belligerent silence after the words. \"I should like to ·see you, Mr. Mallory. Can we make an ap- pointment for you to come to my office?\" \"What do you want to see me about?\" \"About a commission, of course. I want you to do some work for a bUilding of mine.'' There was a long silence. \"All right,\" said Mallory; his voice sounded dead. He added: \"Which building?\" . \"The Stoddard Temple. You may have heard •.. \" \"Yeah, I heard. You're doing it. Who hasn't heard? Will you pay me as much as you're paying your press agent?\" · · \"I'm not paying the press agent. ·I'D pay you whatever you wish to ask.\" \"You know that can't be much.\" \"What time would it be convenient for you to come here?\" \"Oh~ hell, you name it. Youknow I'm not busy.'' \"Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?\" · \"All right.\" He added: \"I don't like your voice.\" Roark laughed. \"I like yours. Cut it out and be here tomorrow at two.\" \"Okay.\" Mallory bung up. Roark dropped the receiver, grinning. But the grin vanished suddenly, and he sat looking at the telephone, his face grave. Mallory did not keep the appointment. Three days passed · without a word from him. Then Roark went to. find him in per- son. · The rooming house where Mallory lived wa5 a dilapidated brownstone in an unlighted street that smelled of a fish market. There was a laundry and a cobbler on the ground floor, at either Side of a narrow entrance. A slatternly landlady said: \"Mallory? F'lfth floor rear,'' and shuffled away indifferently. Roark climbed sagging wooden stairs lighted by bulbs stuck in a web of pipes. He knocked at a grimy door. . . . The door opened. A gaunt young man stood on the threshold; 'he had disheveled hair, a strong mouth with a square lower lip, and the most expressive eyes that Roark had ever seen. \"What do you waJit?\" he snapped . . \"Mr. Mallory?\" · \"Yeah.\" \"I'm Howard Roark.\" Mallory laughed, leaning against the doorjamb, one arm stretched across the opening, with no intention of stepping aside. He was obviously drunk. , · · \"Well, well!\" he said. \"In person.\" \"May I come in?\" · \"What for?\" 325"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Roark sat down on the stair bani~ter. \"Why didn;t you keep your appointment?\" \"Oh, the appointment? Oh, yes. Well, I'll tell you,\" Mallory said gravely. ''It was like this: I really inJended ~o keep it, I really did, and I started out for your office, but on my way there I ·passed a movie theater that was showing 1Wo Heads on a Pillow, so I went_ in. I just had to see Two Heads on a Pillow.\" He grinned, sagging against his stretched arm. \"You'd better let me come in,\" said Roark quietly. \"Oh, what the hell, come in.\" The room was a narrow hole. There was an unmade bed in a corner; a litter of newspapers and old clothes, a gas ring, a framed landscape from the five-and-ten, representing some sort of sick brown meadows with sheep; there were no drawings or figures, no hints of the occupant's profession. Roark pushed some books and a skillet off the only chair, and sat down. Mallory stoodbefore him,. grinning, swaying a little. \"You're doing it all wrong,\" said Mallory. \"That's not the way it's done. You must be pretty hard up to come running after a sculptor. The way it's done is like this: You make me coi:ne to your office, and the ~t time I come you mustn't be there. The second time you must keep me waiting for an hour and a half, then come out into the reception room and shake hands and ask me whether I know the Wilsons of Podunk and say how nice that we have mutual friends, but you're in an awful hurry today and you'll call me up for lunch soon and then we'll talk business. Then you keep this up for two months. Then you give me the commission. Then you tell me that I'm no good and wasn't any good in the first place, and you throw the thing into the ash can. Then you hire Valerian Bronson and be does the job. That's the way it's done. Only not this time.\" But his eyes were stUdying Roark intently, and his eyes had the certainty of a professional. As he spoke, his voice kept losing its swaggering gaiety, and it slipped to a dead flatness on the last sentences. \"No,\" said Roark, \"not this time.\" The boy stood looking at him silently. . . . \"You're Howard Roark?\" he asked. \"I like your buildings. That's why I didn't want to meet you. So I wouldn't have to be sick every time I looked at them. I wanted to go on thinking that they had to be done by somebody who matched them.\" \"What if I do?\" ''That doesn't happen.\" But he sat down on the edge of the crumpled bed and slumped forward, his glance like a sensitive scale weighing Roark's fea- tures, impertinent in its open action of appraisal. \"Listen,\" said Roark, speaking clearly and very carefully, \"I want you to do a statue for the Stoddard Temple. Give me a 326"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"piece of paper and I'll write you a contract right now, stating that I will owe you a million dollars damages if I hire another sculp- tor or if your work is not used.\" \"You can speak noJ:Illal.

''Which?'' \"That I like your work.\" \"Sure. That's what they all say. That's what we're aii supposed to say and to believe. Imagine what would happen if somebdy . blew the lid off that one! So, aii right, you like my work. What's the real reason?'' · \"I like your· work.\" · Mallory-spoke earnestly, his voice sober. ''You mean you saw the things I've done, and you like them- you-yourself-alone-without anyone telling you that you should like them or why you should like them-and you decided that you wanted me, for that reason-only for that reason- without knowing anything about me or giving a damn-only be- cause of the things I've done and . . . and what you saw in. them-only because of that, you decided to hire me, and you went to the bother of finding me and corning here, and being insulted-only because you saw-an~ what you saw made me important to you, made you want me?1s that what you mean?'' \"Just that,\" said Roark. The things that pulled Maiiory's eyes wide were frightening to see. Then be shook his bead, and said very simply, in the tone of soothing himself: \"No.\" He· leaned forward. His voice sounded dead and pleading. \"Listen, Mr. Roark. I won't be mad at you. I just want to 327"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"know. AU right, I see that you're set on having me work for you, and you know you can get me, for anything you say, you don't have to sign any million-dollar contract, look at this room, you know you've got me, so why sltouldn't you teD me the truth?

Why do you want to say things like that?\" \"Because .... \" Mallory roared suddenly,. and then his voice broke, and his head dropped, and he finished in a flat whisper: \"because I've spent two years\"-his hand circled limply indicat- ing the room-\"that's how I've spent them-trying to get used to the fact that what you're tcying to tell me doesn't exist ... :• Roark walked over to him, lifted his chin, knocking it upward, and said: \"You're a God-damn fool. You have no right to care what I think of your work, what I am or why I'm here. You're too good for that._ But if. you want to know it-I think you're the best sculpt9rwe've got. I. think it, because your figures are not what men are, but what men could be--and should be. Because you've gone beyond the probable and made us see what is possible, but possible only through you. Because your figures are more devoid of contempt for humanity than any work I've ever seen. Because you have a magnificent respect for the human being. Because your figures are the heroic in man. And so I didn't come here to do you a favor or because l felt sorry for you or because you need a job pretty badly. I came for a simple, selfish reason~the same reason that makes a man choose the cleanest food he can find It's a law of survival, isn't it?-to seek the best. I didn't come for your sake. I came for mine.\" Mallory jerked himself away from him, and dropped face down on the bed, his two arms stretched out, one on each side of his head, hands closed into fists. The thin trembling of the shirt cloth on his back showed that he was sobbing; the- shirt cloth and the fists that twisted slowly, digging into the pillow. Roark knew that he was looking at a man who had never cried before. He sat down on the side of the bed and could not take his eyes off the twisting wrists, even though the sight was hard to bear. - 328"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"After a while Mallory sat up. He looked at Roark and saw the calmest, kindest face-a face without a hint of pity. It did not look like the countenance of men who watch the agony of an- other with a secret pleasure, uplifted by the sight of a beggar who needs their compassion; it did not bear the cast of the hungry soul that feeds upon another's humiliation. Roark's face seemed tired, drawn at the temples, as if he had just taken a beating. But his eyes were serene and they looked at Mallory qqietly, a hard, clean glance of understanding-and respect. \"lie down now,\" said Roar. \"lie still for a while.\"· \"How did they ever let you survive?\" \"Lie down. Rest. We'll talk afterward.\" Mallory got up. Roark took him by the shoulders, forced him down, lifted his legs off the ftoor, lowered his head on the pillow. The boy did not resist. Stepping back, Roark brushed against a table loaded with junk. Something clattered to the ftoor. Mallory jerked forward, trying to reach it first. Roark pushed his arm aside and picked up the object. It was a small plaster plaque, the kind sold in cheap gift shop$. It represented a baby sprawled on its stomach, dimpled rear for- ward, peeking coyly over its shoulder. A few lines, the structure of a few muscles showed a magnificent talent that could not be hidden, that broke fiercely through the rest; the rest was a delib- erate attempt to be obvious, vulgar and trite, a clumsy effort, un- convincing and tortured. It was an object that belonged . in a chamber of horrors. . Mallory saw Roark's ~d begin to shake. Then Roark's arm went back and up, over his head, slowly, as if gathering the weight of air in the crook of his elbow; it was only a ftash, but it seemed to last for minutes, the arm stood lifted and still-then it slashed forward, the plaque shot across the room and burst to pieces against the wall. It was the only time anyone had ever seen Roark murderously angry. \"Roark.\" \"Yes?\" \"Roark, I wish I'd met you before you had a job to give me.\" He spoke without expi:ession, his head lying back on the pillow, his eyes closed. \"So that there would be no other reason mixed in. Because, you see, I'm very grateful to you. Not for giving me a job. Not for coming here. Not for anything you'll ever do for me. Just for what you are.\" Then he lay without moving, straight and limp, like a man long past the stage of suffering. Roark stood at the window,look- ing at the wrenched room and at the boy on the bed. He wondered why he felt as if he were waiting. He was waiting for an explo- sion over their heads. It seemed senseless. Then he understood. He thought, this is how men·feel, trapped in a shell hole; this 329"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"· room •s not an accident of poverty, it's the footprint of a war; it's the devastation torn by explosives more vicious than any stored in the arsenals of the world. A war ... against? ... The enemy bad no name and no face.

Only the bell and the safety bad no known designations ... He kept thinking of Kent Lansing, trying to remember something Kent Lansing bad said •.. Then Mallory opened his eyes, and lifted himself up on one el- bow. Roark pulled the chair over to the bed and sat down. \"Now,\" be said, ''talk, Talk, about the things you really want said. Don't tell me about your family, your childhood, your friends. or your feelings. Tell me about the things you think. \" Mallory looked at him incredulously and whispered: \"How did you know that?\" Roark -smiled and said nothing. \"How did you know what's been killing me?

Then be sat for hours, listening, while Mallory s~ke of his work, of the thoughts behind his work, of the thoughts that. shaped his life, spoke gluttonously, like a drowning man flung out to shore, getting drupk on huge, clean snatches of air. Mallory came to Roark's office on the following morning, and Roark showed him the sketches of the Temple. When he stood at a drafting table, with a problem to consider, Mallory changed; there was no uncertainty in him, no remembrance of pain; the gesture of his band taking the drawing was sharp and sure, .like that of a soldier oli duty. The gesture said that nothing ever done to him could alter the function of the thing within .him that was . now called into action. He had an unyielding, impersonal confi- dence; be faced Roark as an equal. He studied the drawings for a long time, then raised his head. Everything about his face was controlled, except his eyes .. \"Like it?\" Roark asked. \"Don't use stupid words.\" He held one of the drawings, walked to the window, stood looking down the sketch to the street to Roark's face and back again. 330"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"\"It doesn't seem .X,ssible,\" he said. \"Not this-and that.\" He waved the sketch at the street. There was a poolroom on the comer of the street below; a rooming house with a Corinthian portico; a billboard advertising a Broadway musical; a line of pink-gray underwear fluttering on a roof. \"Not in the same city. Not on the same earth,\" said Mallory. \"But you made it happen. It's possible. . . . I'll never be afraid again.\" \"Of what?\" Mallory put the sketch down on the table, cautiously. He · answered: \"You said something yesterday about a first law: A law de- manding that man seek the best .... It was funny .... The unrec- ognized genius-:-that's an old story; Have you ever thought of a much worse one-the genius recognized too well? .... That a great many men are poor fools who can't see the best-that's nothing. One can't get angry at that. But do you understand about the men who see it and don't want it?\" · \"N \" . . o. \"No. You wouldn't I spent all night thinking about you. I didn't sleep at all. Do you know what your secret is? It's your terrible innocence.\" . Roark laughed aloud, looking at the boyish face. . \"No,\" said Mallory, ''it's not funny. I know what I'~ talking about:.-and you don't. You can't know. It's because of that absO- lute health of yours. You're so healthy that you can't conceive of disease. You know of it. But you don't really believe it. I do.

Toohey lighted a cigarette. \"So he's chosen S~ven Mallory for the job,\" he said. \"Yes. A funny coincidence, wasn't it?\" \"It's no coincidence at all, my dear. Things like that are never a coincidence. There's a basic law behind it. Though rm sure he doesn't kilow it and nobody helped him to choOse.\" \"I believe you approve?''

Nice of him. I daresay many people will join him af- .ter a while.\" Through the months of that winter Roark seldpm slept more than three hours a night. There was a swinging sharpness in his movements, as if his body fed energy to all those around him. The energy ran through the walls of his office to three points of the city: to the Cord Building, in the center of Manhattan, a tower of copper and glass; to the Aquitariia Hotel on Central Park South;. and to the Temple on a rock over the Hudson, far north on Riverside Drive. When they had time to meet, Austen Heller watched him, amused and pleased. \"When these three are finished, Howard,\" he said, ''nobody will be able to stop you. Not ever again. I spec- ulate occasionally upon how far you'll go. You see, I've always had a weakness for astronomy.\" . On an evening in March Roark stood within the tall enclosure that had been erected around the site of the Temple, according to Stoddard's orders. The first blocks of stone, the base of future walls, rose above the ground. It· was late and the workers had left, The place lay deserted, cut off from the world, dissolved in darkness; but the sky glowed, too luminous for the night below, as. if the light had remained past the normal hour, in announce- ment of the coming spring. A ship's siren cried out once, some- where on the river, and the sound seemed to come from a distant countryside, through miles of silence. A light still burned in the wooden shack built as a studio fpr Steven Mallory, where Do- minique posed for him. The Temple was to be a small building of gray limestone. Its lines were . horizontal, not the lines reaching to heaven, but the lines of the. earth. It seemed to spread over the ground Uke arms outstretched at shoulder-height, palms down, in great, silent ac- ceptance. It did not cling to the soil and it did not crouch under the sky. It seemed to lift the earth,. and its few vertical shafts pulled the sky down. It was scaled to human height in such a manner that it did not dwarf man, but stood as a setting that made his figure the only absolute, the gauge of perfection by which all dimensions were to be judged. When a man entered this temple, he would feel space molded around him, for him, as if it had waited for his entrance, to be completed. It was a joyous place, with the joy of exaltation that must be quiet. It was a place where one would come to feel sinless and strong, to find the peace of spirit never granted save by one's own glory. There was no ornamentation inside, except the graded projec- tions of the walls, and the vast windows. The place was not 334"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"sealed under vaults, but thrown open to the earth around it, to the trees, the river, the sun-and to the skyline of the city in the dis- tance, the skyscrapers, the shapes of man's achievement on earth. At the end of the room, facing the entrance, with the city as background, stood the figure of a naked human body. There was nothing before him now_ in the darkness except the first stones, but Roark thought of the finished building, feeling it in the joints of his fingers, still remembering the movements of his pencil that had drawn it. He stood thinking of iL Then be walked across the rough, tom earth to the studio shack. \"Just a·moment,\" said Mallory's voice when he knocked. Inside the shack Dominique stepped down from the stand and pulled a robe on. Then Mallory opened the door. \"Ob, it's you?\" be said. ''We thought it was the watchman. What aie you doing here so late'r' ''Good evening, Miss Francon,\" said Roark, and she nodded curtly. \"Sorry to interrupt, Steve.\" · \"It's all right. We haven't been doing so well. Dominique can't get quite what I want tonight Sit down, Howard.· What the bell time is it'r' \"Nine-thirty. If you're going to stay longer, want me to have some dinner sent up'r' \"I don't know. Let's have a cigarette.\" _ The place had an unpainted wooden floor, bare wooden lafters, . a cast-iron stove glowing in a comer. Mallory moved about like _ a feudal host, with smudges of clay on his forehead. He smoked !)ervously, pacing up and down. \"Want to get dressed, Dominique?\" be asked. \"I don't think we'll do much mote tonight.\" Shtl didn't answer. She stood look- ing at Roark. Mallory reached· the end of the room, whirlt• i around, smiled at Roark: ''Why haven't you ever come in before; Howard?_ Of course, if I'd been really busy, I'd have thrown you out. Wh3t, by the way, are you doing here at this bour'r' \"I just wanted to· see the place tonight. Couldn't get here earlier.\" \"Is this what you want, Stever' Dominique asked suddenly. She took her robe off and walked naked to the stand. Mallory looked from her to Roark and back again. Then be saw what be had been struggling to see all day. He saw her body standing be- fore him, straight and tense, her head thrown back, her arms at her sides, palms out, as she stood for many days; but now her body was alive, so still that it seemed to tremble, saying what he had wanted to hear: a proud, reverent, enraptured surrender to a vision of her own, the right moment, the moment before the fig- ure would sway and break, the moment touched by the reflection of what she saw. · Mallory's cigarette went flying across the room. \"Hold it, Dominique!\" he cried. \"Hold it! Hold it!\" 335"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"He was at his stand before the. cigarette hit the ground. He worked.. and Dominique stood without moving, and Roark stood facing her, leaDing against the wall. In April the walls of the Temple rose in broken lines over the ground. On moonlit nights they bad a soft, .smeared, underwater glow. The tall fence stood on guard around them. After the day's work, four people would often remain at the site-Roark, Mallory, Dominique and Mike Donnigan. Mike bad .not missed employment on a single buildinE of Roark's. The four of them sat together in Mallory s shack, after all the others had left. A wet cloth covered the unfinished statue. The door of the shack stood open to the first warmth of a spring night. A tree branch hung outside, with three new leaves against the black sky, stars trembling like drops of water on the edges of the leaves. There were no chairs in the shack. Mallory stood at the cast-iron stove, fixing hot dogs and coffee. Mike sat on .the model's stand, smoking a pipe. Roark lay stretched out on the floor, propped up on his elbows, Dominique sat on a kitchert stool, a thin silk robe wrapped about her, her bare feet on the planks of the floor. They did not speak. about their work. Mallory told outrageous stories and Dominique laughed like a child .. They talked about nothing in. particular, sentences that bad meaning only in the sound Qf. the voices, in the warm gaiety, in the ease of complete J.l''JaxaqOD,. The)'. were simply four people who liked being there together. The wiills rising in the darkness beyond the open door gave sanction to their rest,. gave them the right to lightness, the bUilding .:tn which they had all worked together, the building that was like a low. audible harmony to the sound of their voices. Roark laughed as Dominique had never seen him laugh anywhere else, his mouth loose and young. . They stayed there late into the night. Mallory poured coffee into a mongrel assortment of cracked cups. The odor of coffee met the odor of the new leaves outside. In May work ~as siopped on. the construction of the Aquitania Hotel. Two of the owners bad been cleaned out in the stock market; a tJrlrd got his funds attached by a lawsuit owr an inheritance disputed by someone; a fourth embezzled somebody else's . shares. The corporation blew up in a tangle of coun cases that were to require years of untangling. The building bad to wait, un- finished. . . ''I'll straighten it out, if I have to murder a few of them,\" Kent Lansing told Roark. \"I'll get it out of their hands. We'll finish it soine day, you and I. But it will take ~. Probably a long time. I won't tell you to be patient. Men like you and ine would not 336"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"survive beyond their first fifteen years if they did not acquire the patience of a Chinese executioner. And the hide ~f a battleship.\" Ellsworth Toohey laughed, sitting on the edge of Dominique's desk. ''The Unfinished Symphony-thank God,\" he said. Dominique used that in her column. ''The Unfinished Sym- phony on Central Park South,\" she wrote. She did not say, \"thank God.\" The nickname was repeated. Strangers noticed the odd sight of an expensive structure on an important street, left gaping with empty windows, half-covered walls, naked beams; when they: asked what it was, people who had never heard ofRpark or of the- story behind the building, snickered and answered: \"'h, that's the Unfinished Symphony.\" · · . · · ·Late ar·night ·Roark would stand· across the street, under the trees of the Park, and look at the black, dead shape among the . glowing structures of the city's skyline. His hands would move as they had moved over die clay ~odel; at that distance, a broken projection· could be covered by 1h~ palm of his hand; but the in- stinctive completing motion met nothing but air. · He forced himself-sometimes' to walk through the building. He walked on· shiveririg ·planks hung over emptiness,. through rooms without ceilings . and rooms without floors, to the t>peir edges where girders stuck out like bones through a broken skin. . An old watctunan lived in a cubbyhole· at .tlie back. of the ground floor. He knew Roark and let him wander around. Once, he stopped Roark on the· way out arid said suddenly: ''I had a son once-almost. He was born dead.\"· Something had. ma,de hiin say that, and he looked at Roark, not quite certain of what he bad wanted to say. But Roark smiled, his eyes closed, and his hand covered the old man's shoulder, like a handshake, and then he wal}ted ·away. · It was only the first- few weeks. Then he made himself forget the Aquitania. On an evening in October Roark and Do~que walked to- gether through the completed Temple. It was to be opened pub- licly in a week, the day after Stoddard's return. No one had seen it·except those who had worked on its cons.truction. It was a clear, quiet evening. The .site of the Temple lay empty and silent. The red of the sunset on the limestone walls wu like the first light of morning. They stood looking at the Temple, and then. stood inside, be- fore the marble figure; saying nothing to each other.· The shadows in the molded space around them seemed shaped by the same hand that 'had shaped the walls.

On the morning of October 31 Hopton Stoddard returned from his journey around the world .. Ellsworth Toohey met him at the pier. On the morning of November 1 Hopton Stoddard issued a ·brief statement announeing that there would be no opening. No explanation was given. . On the morning of November 2 the New York Banner came out with the column \"One Small Voice\" by Ellsworth M. Toohey subtitled \"Sacrilege.\" It read as follows: ''The time has come, the walrus said, To talk of many things: Of ships-and shoes-and Howard Roark- And cabbages.-and kings- And why the sea is boiling hot~ And whether Roark has wings; . \"It is not our function-paraphrasing a philosopher whom we do not like-to be a fly swatter, but when a fly acquires delusions of grandeur, the best of us must stoop to do a little job of extermination. ''There has been ·a great deal of talk l~tely about some- body named Howard Roark. Since freedom of speech is our sacred heritage and includes the freedom to waste one's time, there would have been no harm in such talk-beyond the fact that ()De could find so many endeavors more profit- able than discussions of a man who seems to have nothing to his credit except a building that was begun and could not be completed. There would have been no· harm, if the ludi- crous had not become the tragic-and the fraudulent. \"Howard Roark-as most of you have .not heard and are not likely 'to hear again-is an architect. A year ago he was entrusted with an assignment of extraordinary responsibility. He was commissioned to erect a great monument in. the .ab- sence of the owner who believed in him and gave him com- plete freedom of action. If the terminology of our criminal 338"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"law could be applied to the realm of art. we would have to say that whafMr. Roark delivered·constitutes the equivalent of spiritual embezzlement. . · \"Mr. Hopton Stoddard, the noted philanthropist, had in- tended to present the City of New York with a Temple of Religion, a non-sectarian cathedral symbolizing the spirit of human faith. What Mr. Roark bas built for him might- be a warehouse-though it does not seein practical. It might be a brothel-which is more likely, if we consider some of its sculptural ornamentation. It is certainly not a temple. \"It &eems as if a deliberate malice had reversed in this building every conception proper to a religious structure. In- stead of being austerely enclosed, this alleged temple .is wide open, like a western saloon. Instead of a mood of def- erential sorrow, befitting a place where one contemplates eternity and realizes the insignificance of man, this building has a quality of loose, orgiastic elation. lnsteac;l of the soar- ing line~ reacliiilg for heaven, demanded by the very nature of a temple, as a symbol of man's quest for \"something higher than his little ego, this building ·is flauntingly hori- zontal, its belly i!l the mud,· thus declaring its allegiance to the carnal, glorifying the gross pleasures of the flesh· above those of the spirit. The statue of a nude female in a place where men come to be uplifted speaks for itself and requires no further comment. \"A person entering a temple seeks release. from hif!lself. He wishes to humble his pride, to confess his QllWorthiness, . to beg forgiveness. He finds fulfillment in a sense of abject humility. Man'!! proper posture in a house of God is on his Jcnees. Nobody in his right mind would kneel within Mr. Roark's temple. The place forbids it. The emotions it sug- gests are of a different nature: arrogance, audacity, defiance, self-exaltation. It is not a house of God, but the cell of a megalomaniac. It is· not a· temple, but its· perfect antithesis, an insolent mockery .of all religion. We would call it pagan but for the fact that the pagans were notoriously good archi- tects. \"This column is not the. supporter of any particular creed, but simple decency demands that we respect the religious convictions of our fellow men. We felt we must explain to the public the nature of this deliberate attack on religion. We cannot condone an outrageous sacrilege. \"If we seem to have forgotten our function. as a critic of purely architectural values, we can say only that the occa- sion does not call for it. It is a mistake to glorify mediocrity· by an effort at serious criticism. We seem to recall some- thing or other that this Howard Roark has built before, and ·it had the same ineptitude, the same pedestrian quality of an 339"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"overambitious amateur. All God's chillun may have ~. but; unfortunately, this is not true of all God's geniuses. . \"And that, my friends, is that. We are glad today'schore is over. We really do not enjoy writing obituaries.\" On November 3 Hopton Stoddard filed suit agilinst Howard Roark for breach of contract and malpractice, asking damages; he asked a sum sufficient to have the Temple altered by another architect. It had been easy to persuade l:lopton Stoddard. He had re- turned from hiS journey, crush~d by the universal spectacle of re- · ligion, most particularly by the various forms in which the · promise of hell confronted him all over the earth. He had been driven.to the conclusion that ltis life qualified him for the worst possible hereafter under any system of faith. It had shaken what remained of hiS mind. The ship stewards, on his return trip, had felt certain that the old gentleman was senile. On the afternoon of his return Ellsworth Toohey took him to see the Temple. Toohey said nothing. Hopton Stoddard stared, and Toohey beard Stoddard's false teeth clicking spasmodically. The place did not resemble anything Stoddard had seen anywhere in the world; nor anything he had expected. He did not know · what to think. When he turned a: glance of desperate appeal upon Toohey, Stoddard's eyes looked like Jell-0. He waited. In that moment, Toohey could have convinced him of anything. Toohey spoke and said what he said later in his column. \"But you told me this Roark was good!\" Stoddard moaned in panic. · · · \"I had expected him to be good,\" Toohey answered coldly. \"But then-why?\" \"I don't know,\" said-Toobey-and his accusing glance gave Stoddard to understand that there was an ominous guilt behind it all, and that the guilt was Stoddard's. · · Toohey said nothing in the limousine, on their way back to Stoddard's apartment, while Stoddard begged him to speak. He would not answer. The silence drove Stoddard to terror. In the apartment, Toohey led him to an ·an;ncbair and stood before him, somber as a judge. \"Hopton~ I know why it happened.\" \"Oh, why?\" . \"Can you think ofany .reason why I should have lied to you?\" \"No, of course not, you're the greatest expert and the most honestman living, and I don't underStand, I just simply don't un- derstand at all!\" . \"I do. When I recommended Roark, I had every reason to expect-to the best of my honest judgment-that he would give . 340"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"you a masterpiece. But he didn't.

He did not consider you worthy of presenting Him with a shrine. I gliess you. can fool me, Hopton, and all men, but you can't fool God. He knows that your record is blacker than anything l suspected.\" He went on speaking for a long time, calmly, severely, to a si- lent huddle of terror. At the end, he said: · \"It seems obvious, Hopton, that you cannot buy forgiveness by startilig at the top. Only the pure in heart can erect a shrine. You must go through many humbler steps of expiation before you i'each that stage. You must atone to your fellow men before you can atone to God. This building was not meant to be a temple, but an institution of human charity. Such as a ho~qe for subnormal chil- dren.\" Hopton Stoddard would not commit.himself to that. \"After- warcl, Ellsworth, afterward,\" he moaned. \"Give me time.\" He agreed to sue Roark, as Toohey· suggested; for recovery of the costs of alterations, and later to decide what these alterations would be. ·~Don't be shocked by anything I will say or write about this,\" Toohey told him in parting. \"I shall be forced to stage a few things which are not quite true. I must protect my own reputation from a disgmce which is your fault, not mine. Just remember that you ha\\'e sworn never to reveal who advised you to hire Roark.\" On the following day \"Sacrilege\" appeared in the Banner and set the fuse. The announcement of Stoddard's suit lighted it. Nobody would have felt an urge to crusade about a building; but religion had been attacked; the press agent had prepared the ground too well, the spring of public attention was wound, a great many people could make use of it. The clamor of indignation that rose against Howar~ Roark and his temple astonished everyone, except Ellsworth Toohey. :Minis- ters damned the building in sermons. Women's Clubs pasSed res- olutions of protest. A Committee of Mothers made page eight of the newspapers; with a petition that shrieked something about the protection of their children. A famous actress wrote an article.on . the essential unity of all the arts, explained that the Stoddard Temple had no sense of structural diction, and spoke of the time when she had played Mary Magdalene in·a great Biblical drama. A society woman wrote an article on the exotic shrines she liad seen in her dangerous jungle travels, praised the touching faith of the savages and reproached modem man for cynicism; the Stod- dard Temple, she said, was a symptom of softness and deca- dence; the illustration showed her in breeches, one- slim foot on the neck of a dead lion. A college professor wrote a letter to the editor about his spiritual experiences and stated that he could not 34i"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"hive experienced them in a place like the Stoddard Temple. Kiki Holcombe wrote a letter to the editor about her views on life and death. The A.G.A. issued a dignified statement denouncing the Stod- dard Temple as a spiritual and ~tic fraud. Similar statements, with less dignity and more slang, were issued by the Councils of American Builders, Writers and Artists. NobOdy had ever heard of them, but they_. were Councils and this gave weight to their voice. One man would say to another: \"Do you know that the Council of American Builders has said this temple is a piece of architectural tripe?'' in a tone suggesting intimacy with the best of the art world. The other wouldn't want to reply that he had not heard of such ·a group, but would answer: \"I expected them to say· it. Didn't you?'' Hopton Stoddard received so many .letters of sympathy that he began to feel quite happy. He bad never been popular before. Ellsworth, he thought, was right; his brother men were forgiving him; Ellsworth was always right. The better newspapers dropped the story after a. while. But the Banner kept it going. It had been a boon to the Banner. ·Gail Wynand was away, sailing his yacht through the Indian Ocean, and Alvah Scarret was stuck for a crusade. This suited him. Ellsworth Toohey needed to make no suggestions; Scarret rose to th~ occasion all by himself. . . He wrote about the decline of civilization and deplored the loss -of the simple faith. He sponsored an essay contest for high- school students on \"Why I Go to Church.\" He ran a series ofil- lustrated articles on ''The Churches of Our Childhood.\" He ran photographs of religious sculpture thrOugh the age~e Sphinx, gargoyles, totem poles-and gave great prominence to pictures of Dominique's statue, with proper captions of indignation, but omitting the DJ.odel's name. He ran cartoons of Roark as a barbar- ian with bearskin and club. He wrote many clever things about the Tower of Babel that could not reach heaven and about Icarus who flopped on his wax wings. · · · Ellsworth Toohey sat· back and watched. He made two minor sli~gestions: be found, in the Banner's morgue, the photograph of ROark at the opening of the Enright House, the photograph of a man'.S face in a moment of exaltation, and he had it printed in the Banner. over the caption: \"Are you happy, Mr. Superman?'' He Blade Stoddard open the Temple to the public while awaiting the trial of his suit. The Temple attracted crowds of people who left obscene drawings and inscriptions ()n the pedestal of Do- rilinique's statue. There were a few who came, and saw, and admired the build- ing in silence. But they were the kind who do not take part in public issues. Austen Heller wrote a furious article in defense of 342"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Roark and of the Temple. But he was not an authority on archi- tecture or religion, and the article was drowned in the storm. Howard Roark did nothing. He was asked for a statement, and he received a group of re- porters in his office. He spoke without anger. He said: \"I can't tell anyone anything about my building. If I prepared a hash of words to stuff into other people's brai~s. it would be an insult to them and to me. But I am glad you came here. I do. have some- thing to say. I want to ask every man who is interested in this to go and see the building, to look at it and then to use the words of his. own mind, if he cares to speak.\" The Banner·printed the interview as follows: \"Mr. Roark, who seems to be a publicity hound, received reporters with an air of swaggering insolence and stated that the public mind was hash. He did not choose to talk, but he seemed well aware of the ·ad- vertising angles in the situation. All he cared about, he explained, was to have his b~ldilig seen by as many people as possible.\" · Roark refused to hire an attorney to represent him at the com~ ing trial. He said he would handle ·his own defense and refused to explain how he intended to handle it, ip spite of Austen Hel- ler's angry pretests. . . \"Austen, there .are some rules I'm perfectly willing tO obey. I'm willing to wear the kind of clothes everybody wears, to eat the same food and use' the same subways.· But there are sonie things which I can't do their way-and this is one of them.\" \"What ·do you know about courtrooms and law? He's going to win.\" . . . . . ''To win what?'' · \"His case.\" \"Is the case of any importance? There's nothing I can do to stop him from touching the building. He owns it. He can blast it off the face of the earth or make a glue factory out of it. He can do it whether I· win ·that suit or lose it.\" · · . \"But he'll take yout money to do it with.\" · \"Yes. He might take my money.\" Steven Mallory made no comment· on anything. But his face looked as it had looked on the night Roark met him for the fll'St time. · \"Steve, talk about it, if it will- make it easier for you,\". Roark said to him one evening. · . _ \"There's nothing to talk about,\" Mallory answered indiffer- ently. \"l told you I didn't think they'd let you survive.\" · \"Rubbish. You have no right to be afraid for me.\" \"I'm not afraid for you. What would be the use? It's some- thing else.\" . · Days later, sitting on the window sill in Roark's room, looking out at the street, Mallory said suddenly: \"Howard, do you remember what I told you about the beast 343"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"I'm afraid ofl I know nothing about Ellsworth Toohey.

She. put her bag down on a table and stood removing.her gloves, Slowly, as if she wished to prolong the intimacy of performing a routine gesture here, in bis room; she looked down at her fingers. Then· she raised her head. Her face looked as if she-knew bis worst suffer- ing and it was hers and she wished to bear it like this, coldly, asking no words of mitigation. . \"You're wrong,\" he said. They could always speak like this to each other, continuiilg a conversation they had not begun. His voice was gentle. \"I don't feel that.\" ''f don't wanfto know.\" \"I want you to know.

' \"I think you should now ask me a question. or perhaps you don~t like to be obvious and feel that I must guess the question myself? I think you're right. The question is, why did I choose Howard Roark? Because-to quote my own article-it is not my function to be a tly 11watter. I quote this now with a .somewhat different meaning, but we'll let that pass. Also, this has helped me to get something I wanted from Hopton Stoddard, but that's only a minor side-issue, an incidental, just pure gravy.

He shrugged and settled back fn his chair. . \"All right,\" he said. \"Incidentally, don't try to buy Hopton Stoddard out. He's eating out of my hand just now. He won't sell.\" She had opened the door, but she stopped and pulled it shut again. \"Oh, yes, of course I know that you've tried. it's no use. You're not that rich. You haven't enough to buy that temple and you couldn't raise enough. Also, Hopton won't accept any money from you to pay for the alterations. I know you've offered that, too. He wants it from Roark. By the way, I don't think Roark would like it if I let him know that you've tried.\" He smiled in a manner that demanded a protest.

'fbe courtroom was so full ~t mass reactions could be ex- J){essed only by a slow· motion running across the spread of heads, a sluggish wave like the ripple under the tight-packed skin of a sea lion. . The crowd, brown and streaked with subdued color, looked like a fruitcake of all the arts, with the cream of the A.G.A. rich and heavy on top. There were distinguished men . and well- dressed, tight-lipped women; each woman ·seemed to feel an ex- clusive proprietorship of the . art practiced by her escort, a monopoly guarded by resentful glances at the others. Almost ev- erybody knew almost everybody else. The room had the atmo- sphere of a co~vention, an opening night and a family picnic. Tbere·was a fee~g of \"our bunch,\" \"our boys,\" \"our show.\" Steven Mallory, Austen l{eller, Roger Enright, Kent Lansing and ~e sat together 'in one comer. They tried not to look around them. Mike was worried about Steven Mallory. He kept close to l4all9ry, insisted on sitting next to him and glanced at him whenever. a particularly offensive bit of copversation reached tbem. Mallory noticed it at last, and said: · \"Don't worry, Mike. I won't scream . .I won't shoot anyone/' \"Watch y~ur stOmach, ~d,\" said Mike-, '1ust watch your stom- ach. A man .can't get sick just because he ougbta.\" · \"Mike; do you remember the night when we stayed sq late that it was a1mo5t daylight, ~d Dominique's car was out of gas, and there \\Vere.no busses; and ~e all del;ided to walk ho~e. and there was sun on.the rooftops. by the time the first ·one of us got to his house?\" · · · \"That's right. You think about that, and I'll think about the granite quarry.'' - · . \"What granite quarry?\" . · \"It's something made me very sick once, but then it turned out it make no difference at all, in the long run.\" Beyond the windows the'sky was :white and fiat like frosted glass. The light seemed to come from the banks of snow on roofs and ledges, an unnatural light that .made everything in the room looknaked. · . The judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he were roost- ing. He had a small face, wizened into virtue. He kept his hands upright in front of his chest, the fingertips pressed together. Hopton Stoddard was not present~ He was represented by his at- torney a handsome gentleman, tall and grave as an ambassador. Roark sat alone at the defense table. The crowd had stared at 348"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"him and given up angrily, finding no satisfaction. He did not look crushed and he did not look defiant. He looked impersonal and calm. He was not like a public figure in a public place; he was like a man alone in his own room, listening to the radio. He took no notes; there were no papers on the table before him, only a large brown envelope. The crowd would have forgiven anything, except a man who could remain normal under the vibrations-of its enormous collective sneer. Some of them had come prepared to pity him; all of them hated him after the first few minutes. . The plaintiff's attorney ~tated his case in a simple opening ad- dress; it was true, he admitted, that Hopton Stoddard had given Roark full freedom to design and build the Temple; the point was, however, that Mr. Stoddard had clearly specified and ex- pected a temple; the building in question could not be considered a temple by any known standards; as the plaintiff proposed to prove_ with the help of the best authorities in the field . . Roark waived his privilege to make an opening statement to thejury. . -· Ellsworth Monkton Toohey was the first witness called by the plaintiff. He sat on the edge of the witne8s chair and leaned back, resting on the end of his spine: he lifted one leg and placed it horizontally across_the other. He looked amused-but managed to suggest that his amusement was a well-bred protection against looking bored. · The attorney went through a long list of questions about Mr. Toohey's professional qualifications, including the number of copies sold of his book Sermons in Stone. Then he read aloud Toohey's column \"Sacrilege\" and asked him to state whether he had written it. Toohey replied that he had. There followed a list of questions in erudite terms on the architectural merits of the Temple. Toohey proved that it had none. There followed an his- torical review. Toohey, speaking easily and casually, gave a brief sketch of all known civilizations and of their outstanding reli- gious monuments-from the Incas to the Phoenicians to the Easter Islanders-including, whenever possible, the dates when these monuments were begun and the dates when they were com- pleted, the number of workers employed in the construction and the_ approximate cost in modem American dollars. The audience listened punch-drunk. Toohey proved that the Stodd_ard Temple contradicted every brick, stone aQd precept of history. \"I have endeavored to show,\" he said in conclusion, \"that the two essentials ofthe conception of a temple area sense of awe and a sense of man's humility. We have noted tbe-gigantic proportions of religious edifices, the soar- ing lines, the horrible grotesques of monster-like gods, or;later, gargoyles. All of it tends to impress upon man his essential insig- nificance, to crush him by sheer magnitude, to imbue him with that sacred terror which leads to the meekness of virtue.

This building is. a monument to a pro- found hatred of humanity. It is one man's ego defying the most sacred impulses of all mankind, of every· man on the street, of every man in this courtroom!\" This was not a witness in court, but Ellsworth Toohey address- ing a meeting-and the reaction w~ inevitable:. the audience burst into applause. The judge struck his gavel and made a threat to have the courtrOom cleared. Order was restored, but not to the faces of the crowd: the faces remained lecherously self-righteous. It was 'pleasant to be singled out.and .brought into the case as an injured party. Three-fourths of them bad n~ver seen the Stoddard Temple. ''Thank you, Mr. Toohey,\" said the attorney, faintly suggesting a bow. Then be turned to Roark and said with delicate courtesy: \"Your witness.\" · \"No questions,\" said 'Roark . . Ellsworth Toohey raised one eyebrow and left the stand regret- fully. . ''Mr. Peter Keating!\" called the attorney. Peter Keating's face-looked attractive and fresh, as if be had had a good night's sleep. He mounted the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto, swinging his shoulders and arms unnec- essarily. He took the oath and answered the firSt questions gaily. His pose in the witness chair was strange: his torso slumped to one Side with swaggering ease, an elbow on the chair's arm; but his feet were planted awkwardly stnlight, and his knees were pressed tight together. He never looked at Roark. . \"Will you please name some of the outstanding buildings - which you have designed, Mr. Keating?\" the attorney asked. Keating began a list of impressive names; the first few came fast, the rest slower and slower, as if he ~shed to be stopped; the . last one died in the air, unfinished. · \"Aren't .you forgetting the most important one, Mr. Keating?'' ·the a_ttorney asked. \"Didn't you design the Cosmo-Slotnick Building?'' \"Yes,\"· whispered Keating. \"Now, Mr. Keating, you attended the Stanton Institute of Tech- nology at the same period as Mr. Roark?\" \"Yes.\" \"What can you tell us about Mr. Roark's record there?'' \"He was expelled.\" '11e was expelled because he was unable to live up to the In- stitute's high standard of requirements?'' \"Yes.

That evening Mallory, Heller, Mike, Enright and Lansing gath- ered in Roark's room. They had not consulted one another, but they all came,_ prompted by. the same feeling. They did not talk about the trial, but there was no strain and no conscious avoid- ance of the subject. Roark sat on his drafting table and talked to them about the futu.re of the plastics industry. Mallory laughed aloud suddenly, without apparent reason. \"What's the matter, Steve?\" Roark asked. \"I just thought . . . Howard, we all came here to help you, to cheer you up. But it's you who're helping us, instead. You're supporting your supporters, Howard.\" That evening, Peter Keating lay half-stretched across a table in a speak-easy, one arm extending along the table top, his face on his arm. In the next two days a succession· ef witnesses testified for the plaintiff. Every examination began with questions that brought out the professional achievements of the witness. The attorney gave them leads like an expert press agent. Austen Heller re- marked that architects must have fought for the privilege of being called to the witness stand, since it was the grandest spree of publicity in a usually silent profession. None of the witnesses looked at Roark. He looked at them. He ·listened to the testimony. He said: \"No questi~ns,\" to each one. Ralston Holcombe on the stand, with flowing tie and gold- headed cane, had the appearance of a Grand Duke or a beer- garden composer. His testimony was long and scholarly, but it came down to: \"It's all nonsense. It's all a lot of childish nonsense. I can't say that I feel much sympathy for Mr. Hopton Stoddard. He should have known better. It is a scientific fact that the architectural style of the Renaissance is the only one appropriate to our age. If our best people, like Mr. Stoddard, refuse to recognize this, what can· you expect from all soris of parvenus, would-be archi- tects and the rabble in general? It has been proved that Renais- sance is the only permissible style for all churches, temples and cathedrals. What about Sir Christopher Wren? Just laugh that off. And remember the greatest religious monument of all time-St. Peter's in Rome. Are you going to improve upon St. Peter's? And if Mr. Stoddard did not specifically insist on Renaissance, he got just exactly what he deserved. It serves him jolly well right.\" Gordon L.

The flowing life which comes from the sense of order in chaos, or, if you prefer, from unity in diversity, as well as vice versa, which is the realization of the contradiction inherent in architecture, is here absolutely absent. I am really trying to express myself as clearly as I can, but it is impossible to present a dialectic. state by covering it up with an old fig leaf of logic just for the sake of the mentally lazy layman.\" John Erik Snyte testified modestly and unobtrusively that he had employed Roark in his office, that Roark had been an unre- liable, disloyal and unscrupulous employee, and that Roark had started his career by stealing, a client from him. On the fourth day of the trial the plaintiff's attorney called his last witness . . ''Miss Dominique Francon,\" he announced solemnly. Mallory gasped, but no one beard it; Mike's band clamped down on his wrist and made him keep still. The attorney bad reserved Dominique for his climax, partly because he expected a great deal from her, and partly because he was worried; she was the only unrehearsed witness; she had re- fused to be coached. She- had never mentioned the Stoddard Tem- ple in her column; but he had looked. up her earlier writings on Roark; and Ellsworth Toohey had advised him to call her. Dominique stoOd for a moment on the elevation of the witness stand, looking slowly over the crowd. Her beauty was startling but too impersonal, as if it did not belong to her; it seemed pres- ent in the room as a separate entity. People thought of a vision that had not quite appeared, of a victim on a scaffold, of a person standing at night at the rail of an ocean liner. \"What is your name?\" ''Dominique Francon.\" \"And your occupation, Miss Frimcon?'' \"Newspaper woman.\" \"You are the author of the brilliant column 'Your House' ap- pearing in the New York Banner?'' \"I am the .author of 'Your House.'\" \"Your father is Guy Francon, the eminent .architect?\" \"Yes.

She held a paid job in a settlement house, she had a small bank account of her own; she took her friends out to lunch, older women of her profession, and they talked about the problems of unwed mothers, self-expression for the children of the poor, and the evils of. industrial corporations. In the· last few years Toohey seemc;:d to have forgotten her ex- istence. But he knew that she was enormously aware of him in her silent, self-effacing way. He was seldom first to speak to her. But she came to him continuously for minor advice. She was like a small motor running on his energy, and she had to stop for re- fueling once in a while. She would not go to the theater without consulting him about the play. She would not attend a lecture course without asking his opinion. Once she developed a friend- ship with a girl who was intelligent,~capable, gay and loved the poor, though ·a social worker. Toohey did not approve of the girl. Catherine dropped her. When she needed advice, she asked for it briefly, in passing, anxious not to delay him: between the courses of a meal, at the elevator d()()r on his way out, in the living room when some im- portant broadcast -stopped for station identification. She made it a point to show that she would presume to claim nothing but the waste scraps of his time. So Toohey looked at her, surprised, when she entered his study.

He glanced at the room and noted angrily how vulgar his Victorian furniture looked beside the elegance of Dominiq~e·s figure. She wore a gray suit, a black fur jacket with a collar raised to her cheeks, and a hat slanting down. She did not look as she had looked on the witness stand, nor as he re- membered her at dinner parties. He thought suddenly of that mo- ment. years ago, when he stood on the stair landing outside Guy Francon's office and wished never to see Dominique again. She was what she had been then: a stranger who frightened him by the crystal emptiness of her face. ''Well, sit down, Dominique. Take your coat off.\". ''No,.I shan't stay long.

My car is down- stairs. We drive to Connecticut and we come back. It will take about three hours.\" \"Dominique ... \" He didn't want to move his lips beyond the effort of her name.

I told them to you once, long ago. If you haven't the courage to think of them, don't expect me tore- peat 'them.\" He sat still, his head down.

Her glance was on his eyes, but it had no more reality than the glance of a portrait. He felt alone in the room. She stood, patient, waiting, granting him nothing, not even the kindness of prompting him to hurry. \"All right, Dominique. Yes,:' he said at last. She inclined her head gravely in acquiescence. He stood up. \"I'll get my coat,\" he said. \"Do you want to take your car?\" \"Yes.\" \"It's an open car, isn't it? Should I wear my fur coat?\" \"No. Take a warm muffler, though.

He stepped. to the door of the living room, hat in hand, and invited her to go, with a silent movement of his head. In the hall outside he pressed the button of the elevator and he stepped back to let her enter first. He was precise, sure of himself, without joy, without emotion. He seemed more coldly masculine than he had ever been before. He took her elbow firmly, protectively, to cross the street where she had left her car. He opened the car's door, let her slide behind the wheel and got in silently beside her. She leaned over across him and adjusted the glass wind screen on his side. She said: \"If it's not right, fix it any way you want when we start moving, so it won't be too cold for you.\" He said: \"Get to the Grand Concourse, fewer lights there.\" She put her handbag down on his lap while she took the wheel and started the car. There was suddenly no antagonism between them, but a quiet, hopeless feeling of comradeship, as if they were victims of the same im- personal disaster, who had to help_ each other. She drove fast, as a matter of habit, an even speed without a sense of haste. They sat silently to the level drone of the motor, and they sat patiently, without shifting the positions of their bod- ies, when the car stopped for· a light. They seemed caught in a single streak of motion, an imperative direction like the flight of a bullet that could not be stopped on its course. There· was a first . hint of twilight in the streets of the city. The pavements looked yellow. The shops were still open. A movie theater had lighted its sign, and the red bulbs whirled jerkily, sucking the last daylight out of the air, making the street look darker. Peter Keating felt no need of speech. He did not seem to be Peter Keating any longer. He did not ask for warmth and he did not ask for pity. He asked nothing. She thought of that once, and she glanced at him, a glance of appreciation that was almost gen- tle. He me~ her eyes steadily; she saw understanding, but no comment. It was as if his glance said: \"Of course,\" nothing else. They were out of the city, with a cold brown road flying to meet them, when he said: \"The traffic cops are bad aroun.d here. Got your press card with you, just in case?\" \"I'm not the press any longer.\" \"You're not what?\" \"I'm not a newspaper woman any more.\" \"You quit your job?'' \"No, l was fired.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Where have you been the last few days?

Somewhere within him he thought that this was almost like unbuttoning- her blouse. But most of him was not conscious of the thought nor of the- intimate proprietorship with_which he opened the bag.

He lighted one for himself and closed the bag. , .- When ~bey reached Greenwich, it was he who made the inqui- ries, told her where to drive, at what block· to tum, and said; \"Here it is,\" when they pulled up in front of the judge's house. He gor out first and helped her out of the car. He pressed the but- ton of the doorbell. · They were married in a living room that displayed armchairs of faded tapestry,. blue and purple, and a lamp with a fringe of glass beads. The witnesses were the judge's wife and someone froni next door named Chuck. who had been interrupted at some housebold task and smelled faintly of Clorox.

But the toad spread as the windshield flew forward. The road filled the glass, it ran over the edges, it to.-e _apart. to _let_ them ·pass, streaming in two gray bands on either side of the car. He thought it wa8 a race and he. waited to see the windshield ~win, to see the car hurtle into that small dash before it had time .to s~tch. \"Where are we going to live now, at firstT' he aSked. \"Your place or mine?\" \"Yours, .of course.\" . \"I'd rather move to yours,\" \"No. I'm closing my place.\" \"You can't possibly like my apartment.\" \"Why notT' \"I don't know.

He watched the small blurs of traffic signs, low by the side of the road, springing suddenly into life as they approached, spelling out: \"Left turn,\" \"Crossing ahead,\" in dots of light that seemed conscious, malevolent, winking. They drove silently, but there was no bond in their silence now; they were not walking together toward disaster; the disaster had come; their courage did not matter any longer. He felt. disturbed and uncertain as he always felt in the pres- ence of Dominique Francon. He half turned to look at her. She kept her eyes on the road. Her profile in the cold wind was serene and remote and lovely in a way that was hard to bear. He looked at her gloved hands rest- ing firinly, one on each side of the wheel. He looked down at her slender foot on the accelerator, then his eyes rose up the line of her leg. His glance remained on the narrow triangle of her tight gray skitt. He realized suddenly that he had a right to think what he . was thinking. · For the first time this implication of marriage occurred to him fully and consciously. Then he knew that he had always wanted this woman, that it was the kind of feeling he would have for a whore, only lasting and hopeless and vicious. My wife, he thought for the first time, without a trace of respect in the word. He felt so violent a desire that had it been summer he would have ordered her to drive into the frrst side lane and he would have taken her there. He slipped his arm along the back of the seat and encirCled her shoulders, his fingers barely touching her. She did not move, re- sist or turn to look at him. He pulled his arm away, and he sat staring straight ahead. · \"Mrs. Keating,\" he said flatly, not addressing her, just as a statement of fact. \"Mrs. Peter Keating,'' she said. When they stopped in front of his apartment house, he got out and held the door for her, but she remained sitting behind the wheel. · \"Good night, Peter,'' she said. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" She added, before the expression of his face had turned into an obscene swearword: \"I'll send my things over tomorrow and we'll discuss everything then. Everything will begin tomorrow, Peter.\" \"Where are you going?'' \"I have things to settle.\" \"But what will I tell people tonigh~?\" \"Anything you wish, if at all.\" She swung the car into the traffic and drove away.

She had left the courtroom after her testimony and he had heard nothing from her since. He had come to her house, but her maid had told him that Miss Francon could not see him. · She looked at him now and she smiled. It was, for the first time, like a gesture of complete acceptance, as if the sight of him solved everything, answered all questions, and her meaning was only to be a woman who looked at him. . They stood silently before each other for· a· moment, and she thought that the most beautiful words were those which were not needed. When he moved, she said: \"Don't say anything about the trial. Afterward.\" . . When he took her in his arms, she turned her body to meet his straight on, to feel the width of his chest with the width of hers, the length of his legs with the length of hers, as if she were lying against him, and her feet felt no weight, and she was held upright by the pressure _of his body. They lay in bed together that night, and they did not know when they slept, the intervals of exhausted unconsciousness as intense an act of union as the convulsed meetings of their bodies. In the. morning, when they were dressed, she watched him move about the room. She saw the drained relaxation of his movements; she thought of what she had taken from him, and the heaviness of her wrists told her that her own strength was now in his nerves, as if they had exchanged their energy. He was at the other end of the room, his back turned to her for a moment, when she said, \"Roark,\" her voice quiet and low. He turned to her, as if he had expected it and, perhaps, guessed the rest. She stood in the middle of the floor, as she had stood on her first night in this room, solemnly composed to the performance of a rite. \"I love you, Roark.\" She had said it for the first time. She saw the reflection of bet next words on his face before she had pronounced them. \"I was married yesterday. To Peter Keating.\" . It would have been easy, if she had seen a man distorting his mouth to-bite off sound, closing his fists and· twisting them in de- fense against himself. But it was not easy, because she did not see him doing this, yet 19lew that this was being done, without the -relief of a physical gesture~ \"Roark ... \" she whispered, gently, frightened. · He said: \"I'm all right.\" Then he said: \"Please wait a mo- ment ...

In his face she saw suffering that was made old, as ~f it had been part of him for a long time, because it was accepted, and it looked not like a wound, but like a scar. · \"Dominique, if I told you now to have that marriage annuJJed at once-to forget the world and my struggle-to feel no anger, no concern, no hope-just to exist for me, for my need of you;-aS my wife-as my property .•. ?''

I won't try to stop you. I love you, Dominique.\" She closed her eyes, and he said: \"You'd rather not bear it now? But I want you to bear it.

He forgot that it was nine o'clock and that Catherine was waiting for him. He had made himself forget her and everyt:hiDg she implied. . The door of his room . was loqked to protect him from his . mother. Last night, seeing his furious restlessness, she had forced him to tell her the truth. He had snapped that he was married to Dominique Francon, and Jl.e had added same sort of explanation · about l)c)minique going out of. town to announce the mattiage to · some old relative. His mother had been so busy with gasps ofde- light and questions,.that he.had been able to answer nothing and to hide his panic; he was 1;1ot certain that he had a wife and that she would come back to him .jn the morning. He had forbidden his mother to announce the news, but ·she had made a few telephone calls last night, and she was matdng a few. more this morning, and now their telephone was ringing constantly; with eager voices asking: \"Is it true?'' pouring out sounds of amazement lind congratulations. Keating could see the news spreading through the city in widening circles, by the names ,and social positions. of the people who called. He refused to answer the telephone. It S!'Cmed to him that. every. comer of New York was flooded with celebration and that he alone, hidden in .the watertight caisson of his room; was cold and lost and hor- rified. It was almost noon when the doorbell rang, and he pressed his . hands to his ears, not to know who it was and what they wanted. Then he heard his mother's voice, so shrill with joy that it sounded embarrassingly silly: \"Petey darling, don't you want to come out and kiss your wife?'' He flew out into the hall, and there was Dominique, removing her soft mink coat, the fur throwing to his nostrils. a wave of the street's cold air touched by her perfume. She was smiling correctly, looking straight at him, saying; \"Good morning, Peter.\" He stood drawn up, for one instant, and in that instant he re- lived all the telephone calls and felt the triumph to which they entitled him. He moved as a man· in the arena of a crowded sta- dium. he smiled as if he felt the ray of an arc light playing in the 377"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"creases of his s~. and he said: \"Dominique my dear; this is like a dream come true!\" · · · The dignity of their doomed understanding wes gone and their marriage was what it had been intended to be. · She seemed glad of it.

Dominique returned the kiss gravely. Mrs. Keating was gulping: \"My dear, I'm so happy, so happy, God bless you, I had no idea you were so beautiful!\" He did. not know what to do next, but Dominique took·charge, simply, leaving them no time for wonder. She walked into· the living roam and she said: \"Let's have lunch first, and then you'll show me the place, Peter. My things will be here in an hour or so.\" Mrs. Keating beamed: \"Lunch is all ready for three, Miss , Fr!m ; . ·.\" She stopped. \"Oh, dear, what am l to call you, honey? Mis.

She instructed the maid how to hang up her clothes, she asked him to help her rearrange the contents of the closets. Mrs. Keating looked putzled. \"But aren't you children going to go away at all? It's all so sudden and romantic, but-no hon- eymoon of any kindT' ''No,\" said Dominique, \"I don't want to take Peter away·from his work.\" He said: ''This is .temporary of course, Dominique.

We'll re- main here.\" \"I'U move out,\" Mrs. Keating offered generously, without thinking,-prompted by an overwhelming fear of Dominique. \"I'll take a little place for myself.\" · ''No,\" said Dominique. '1'd rather you wollldn~t. I want to change nothing. I want to fit myself into Peter's life just as it is.\" \"That's sweet of y()u!\" Mrs. Keating smiled, while Keating thought numbly that it was not sweet of her at all. Mrs. Keating· knew that when she had recovered she would 378"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"hate her daughter-in-law. She could have accepted snubbing. She could not forgive Dominique's grave politeness. The telephone rang.

I really think you ought to call him up or come over here or something.\" Keating hurried to the office, glad to escape from his house for a while. He entered the office like a perfect figure of a radiant young lover. He laughed and shook hands ·in the drafting room, through noisy congratulations, gay shouts of envy and a few smutty references. Then he· hastened to Francon's office. For an instant he felt oddly guilty when he entered and saw the ~mile on FrancQn's face, a smile like a blessing. He tugged affec- tionately at Francon's shoulders and he muttered: \"I'm so happy, Guy, I'm so happy ... \" \"I've always expected it,\" said Francon quietly, \"but now I feel right. Now it's right that it should be all yours, Peter, all of it, this room, everything, soon.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Come, you always understand. I'm tired, Peter.

He could· not stand the sound of pleading in Francon's voice. \"Yes, who wouldn't be? Of course .... And you are, Peter?\" . \"What do you want?\" snapped Keating angrily .. \"I want you to feel proud of me, Peter,\" said Francon humbly, simply, desperately. \"I want to know that I've accomplished 379"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"something. I want to feel that it had some meaning. At the last summing up, I want to be sure that it wasn't all-for n<?thing.\" \"You're not sure of that? You're not sure?'' Keating's eyes were murderous, as if Francon were a sudden danger to him. ''What's the matter, Peter?\" Francon asked gently, almost in- differently. \"God damn you, you have no right-not to be sure! .At your age, with your name, with your prestige, with your .•. \" \"I want to be sure, Peter. I've worked very bani.\" ''But you're not sure!\" He was furious and frightened, and so. he wanted to hurt, and he flung out the one thing that could hurt most, forgetting that it hurt him, not Francon, that Francon wouldn't kil.ow, had never known, wouldn't even guess: ''Well, I know somebody who'll be sure, at the end of his life, who'll be so God-damn sure I'd like to cut his damn throat for it!\" ''Who?\"· asked Francon quietly, without interest \"Guy! Guy, what's the matter with us? What are we talking about?'' ''I don't know,\" said Francon. He looked tired. That evening Francon came to Keating's house for dinner. He was dressed jauntily, and he twinkled with his old gallantry as he kissed Mrs. Keating's band. But he looked grave when he con~ gratu1ated Dominique and he found little to say to her; there was a pleading look in his eyes . when he glanced up at her face. ~ stead of the bright, cutting mockery be had expected from her, he saw a sudden understanding. She said nothing, but bent down and kissed him on the forehead and held her lips pressed gently to his head a second longer than formality required. He felt a warm flood of gratitude-and then he . felt frightened. \"Do- minique.;\" he whispered-the others could not hear him-\"how terribly unhappy you must be .•.. \" She laughed gaily, taking his. arm: ''Why, no, Father, how can you say that!\" ''Forgive me,\" he muttered, ''I'm just stupid .... This is really ·wonderful .... \" Guests kept coming in all evening, uninvited and unari- nounced, anyone who had heard the news and felt privileged to drop in. Keating did not know whether he was glad to see them or not It seemed all right, so long as the gay confusion lasted. Dominique behaved exquisitely. He did not catch a single hint of sarcasm in her manner. It was late when the last gnest departed and they were left alone among the filled' ash trays and empty glasses. They sat at opposite ends of the living room, and Keating tried to postpone the moment of thinking what he had ·to· think now; \"All right, Peter,\" said Dominique, rising, \"let's get .it over with.\" When he lay in the darkness beside her, his desire satisfied and left hungrier than ever by the unmoving body that had not re- sponded, not even in revulsion, when he felt defeated in the one 380"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"act of mastery he had hoped to impose upon her, his first whis- pered words were: ''God damn you!\" He heard no movement from her.

In the afternoon Dominique telephoned Toohey and invited him for dinner. · . The dinner took place a few days later. Keating's mother had pleaded some previous engagement and escaped for the evening; she explained it to herself by believing that she merely .needed time to get used to things. So there were only three- places set on the dining-room table, candles in crystal holders, a centerpiece of . blue flowers and glass bubbles. . When Toohey entered he bowed to his hosts in a manner proper to a court reception. Domfnique looked like a society hostess who had always been a society hostess and could not . possibly be imagined as· anything else. ''Well, Ellsworth? Well?\" Keating asked, with a gesture that . included the ball. the air and Dominique. ''My dear Peter,\" said Toohey, \"let's skip the obvious.\" 381"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Dominique led the way into the living room. She wore a din- ner dress-a white satin blouse tailored like a man's. and a long black skirt, straight and simple as the polished planes of her hair. The narrow band of the skirt about her waistline seemed to state that two hands could encircle her waist completely or snap her figure in half without much effort. The short sleeves left her arms bare, and she wore a plain gold bracelet, too large and heavy for her thin wrist. She had an appearance of elegance become per- version, an appearance of wise, dangerous maturity achieved by looking like a very young girl. \"Ellsworth, isn't it wonderful?'' said Keating, watching Do- minique as one watches a fat bank account. \"No less than I expected,\" said Toohey. \"And no more.\" At the dinner table Keating did most of the talking. He seemed possessed by a talking jag. He turned over words'with the sensu- ous abandon of a cat rolling in catnip. \"Actually, Ellsworth, it was Dominique who invited you. I didn't ask her to. You're our first formal guest I think that's wonderful. My wife and my.best friend. I've alw~ys had the silly idea that you two didn't like each.other. God knows where I·get those .notions.

Certain figures in combination have to give certain results.

Two are better than one, an(l sometimes three are better than two, it all depends/' ''The only thing wrong with that old cliche,\" said Toohey, \"is the erroneous implication that 'a crowd' is a term of opprobrium.

After the Stod- dard trial many earnest discussions were held infonnally in the club rooms of the A.G.A. The attitude of the A.G.A. toward Ellsworth Toohey had not been cordial, particularly since the es- tablishment of his Council. Bu~ the trial brought a subtle change; many members pointed out that the article in \"One Small Voice\" had actually brought ~bout the Stoddard lawsuit; and that a man who could force clients to sue was a IDlpl to be treate4 with cau- tion. So it was suggested that Ellsworth Toohey should be invited to address the.A.G.A. at one efits luncheons. Some members ob- jected, Guy Francon among them. The most passionate objector was a young architect who made an eloquent speech, his voice trembling with the eJ;Dbarrassment of speaking in public for the first time; he said that he admired Ellsworth. Toohey and had al- ways agreed with Toohey's social ideals, but if a group of people felt that ·some person Was' acquiring power over them, that was the time to fight such a pa-Son. l'be inajority overruled him.

They talked about the depression and its disastrous effect on ·the building industrY; they talked about women, and Gordon L. Prescott told. a few jokes of a bathroom nature. Then Gus Webb raised his fist and smacked it plump upon the roof of the m~ which was not quite dry and spread into a flat mess. \"Well, boys,\" he said, \"let's go to work.\" ''Gus, you '.son of a · bitcht said Keating, ''the thing cost· money.\" ''Balls!\" said Gus, \"we're not paying for it.\" .Each of them had a set of photographs of the original sketches with the signature ''Howard Roark\" visible in the comer.

The Stoddard Temple was not toni down, but its framework was carved into five floors, containing dormitories, schoolrooms, infirmary, kitchen, laundry. The enttance hall was paved with colored marble,. the stairways had railings of hand-wrought alu- minum, the shower stalls were gla8s-enclosed, the recreation rooms -~ gold-leafed Corinthian pilasters~ The huge windows were leffuntouched, merely crossed by floorlines. The four architects had decided to -achieve an effect of har- ·mony and therefore not to use any historical style in its pure form. Peter Keating designed the white marble semi-Doric por- tico that rose over the main entrance, and the Venetian balconies for which new doors were cut. John Erik Snyte de- signed the mall semi-Gothic spire surmounted by a cross, and the bandcourses of stylized acanthus leaves which were cut into the limestone of the walls. Gordon L. Prescott designed the semi-RenaiSsance cornice, and the glass-enclosed ·terrace pro- jecting from the third floor. Gus.Webb designed a cubistic orna- ment to frame the original windows, and the modem neon sign on the roof, which lead: \"The Hopton Stoddard Home for Sub- no111l1Jl Children.\" . · · . ''Comes the revolution,\" said Gus Webb, looking at the com- pleted structure\", \"and every kjd in the country will have a home like that!\" The original shape of the building remained discernible. It was · not like a corpse whose fragments had been mereifuUy scattered; it was like a corpse hac~ to pieces and reassembled. In September the tenants of the Home moved in. A small, ex- pert staff was chosen by Toohey. It had been harder to find the children who qualified as inmates. Most of them bad to be taken from other inStitutions. Sixty-five children, their ages ranging from three to fifteen, were picked out by zealous ladies who were full of kindness and so made a point of rejecting those who could be curecJ and selecting only the hopeless caSes. There was a fifteen-year-old boy who had never learned to _speak; a grinning child who could not be taught to read or write; a girl born with- out a nose, whose father was also her grandfather; a person called \"Jackie\" of whose age or ilex nobody could be certain. They marched into their new hOme, their eyes staring vacantly, the stare of death before which no world existed. On warm evenings children from the slums nearby would sneak into the park of the Stoddard Home and gaze wistfully at the playrooms, the gymnasium, the kitchen beyond the big ·win- doWS. These children had filthy clothes and smudged faces, agile little bodies, impertinent grins, and eyes bright with a roaring, imperious, demanding intelligence. The ladies in charge of the 385"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Home chased them away with angry .exclamations about \"little gangsters.\" · . Once a month a delegation from the sponsors came to visit the Home. It was a distinguished group whose names were in many exclusive registers, though no personal achievement bad ever put them there. It was a group of mlnk coats and diaQlond clips; oc- casionally, there was a dollar cigar and a glossy derby from a · British shop among them. Ellsworth Toohey was always present to show them through the Home. The inspection made the mink . coats seem warmer and their wearers' rights to them incontest- able, since it established superiority and altruistic virtue together, . in a demonstration .more potent than a visit to a morgue. On the way back from such an inspection Ellsworth Toohey received bumbled compliments on the wonderful work be was doing, and had no trouble in obtaining checks for his other humanitarian ac- tivities, such as publications, lecture courses,· radio forums. and the Workshop of Social Study: Catherine Halsey was put in charge of the children's occupa- tional therapy, and she moved into the Home as a permanent res- ident. She took up her work with a fierce zeal. She spoke about it insistently to anyone who would listen. Her voice was dry and arbitrary. When she spoke, the movements of her mouth bid the two lines tllat had appeared recently, cut from her nostrils to her chin; people preferred her not to remove her glasses; her eyes were not good to see. She spoke belligerently about her work not being charity, but \"human reclamation.\" The most important time of her day :was the hour assigned to the children's art activities, known as the \"Creative Period.\" There was a special room foi: ·the purpose-a room with a view of the distant city skyline-where the children were given mate- rials and encouraged to create freely, under the guidance of Cath- eri~e who stood watch over them like an angel presiding at a birth. She was elated on the day when Jackie, the least promising one of the lot, achieved a completed work of imagination. Jackie picked up fistfuls of colored felt scraps and a pot of glue, and carried them to a comer of the. room. There was, in the comer, a slanting· ledge projecting from the wall-plastered over and painted green-left from Roark's modeling of the Temple interior that bad once controlled the recession of $,e light at sunset. Cath- erine walked over to Jackie and saw, spread out on the ledge, the recognizable shape. of a dog, brown, with blue spots and five legs. Jackie wore an expression of pride. \"Now you see, you see'?\" Catherine said to her colleagues. \"Isn't it wonderful and moving!

No one knew who bought it It had been bought by Ellsworth Toohey. I Roark's office had sbrunk back to one room. After the comple- tion of the Cord Building he found no work. The depression had wrecked the building trade; there was little work for anyone; it was said that the skyscraper was finished; architects were closing their offices. A few commissions still dribbled out occasionally, and a group of architects hovered about them with the dignity of a bread line. There were men like ~ton Holcombe among them, men who had never begged, but had demanded references before they ac- cepted a client When Roark tried to get a commission, he was rejected ·in a manner. implying that if he had no more sense than that, politeness would be a wasted effort. \"Roark?'' cautiouS busi• nessmen said. ''The tabloid hero'? Money's too scarce nowadays to waste it on lawsuits afterwards.\" He got a few jobs, remodeling rooming houses, an assignment that involved no more than erecting partitions ali.d rearranging the plumbing. \"Don't take it, Howard,\" Austen Heller said angrily. \"The infernal gall of offering you that kind of world After a sky- scraper like the Cord Building. After the Enright House.\" \"''ll take anything,\" said Roark. The Stoddard award had taken more than the ·amount of his fee for the Cord Building. But he had saved enough to exist on for ll while. He paid Mallory's rent and he paid for most of their fre- quent meals together. Mallory had tried to object. \"Shut up, Steve,\" Roark had said. \"I'm not doing it for you. At' a time like this I owe myself a few luxuries. So I'm simply buying the m~st valuable thing that can be bought-'-your time. I'm competing with a whole country- .and that's quite a luxury, isn't it'? They want you to do baby plaques and I don't, and I like having my way against theirs.\" \"What do you want me to work on, Howard?'' ''I want you to work without asking anyone wliat he wants you to work on.\" · Austen Heller heard about it from Mallory, and spoke of it to Roark in private. \"If you're helping him, why don't you let me help you'?\" ''I'd let you if you could,\" said Roark.

On an evening in November he went to see it. He did not know whether it was surrender to pain or victory over the fear of see- ing it. . .

The door under the Greek portico opened and a slight mascu- line figure came out .. It hurried casually down the steps-and then stopped \"Hello, Mr. Roark,\" said Ellsworth Toohey quietly. Roark looked atbim without curiosity. \"Hello,\" said Roark. \"Please don't run away.\" The voice was not mocking, but ear- nest. \"I wasn't going to.\" · \"I think I knew that you'd come here some day and I think I wanted to be here when you came. I've kept inventing excuses for myself to hang about this place.\" There was no gloating in the voice; it sounded drained and simple. \"Well?\" \"You shouldn't mind speaking to me. You see, I understand your work. What I do about it is another matter.\" \"You are free to do what you wish about it.\" \"I understand your work better than any living person-with the possible exception of Dominique Francon. ADd, perhaps, bet- ter than she does. That's a deal, isn't it, Mr. Roark? You hav~n't many people around you who can say that. It's a greater bond than if I were. your devoted, but blind supporter.\" \"I knew you understood.\" . \"Then you won't mind talking to me.\" \"About what?\" In the darkness it sounded almost as if Toohey had sighed. Af- ter a while he pointed to the building and asked: \"Do you understand this?'' Roark did not answer. Toohey went on softly: \"What does it look like to you? Like a senseless mess? Like a chance collection of driftwood? Like an imbecile chaos? But is it, Mr. Roark?

He remained silent, and .Roark asked: \"What did you want to say to me?\" Toohey looked at him, and then at the bare trees around them, at the river far below, at the great rise of the sky beyond the river. · \"Nothing,\" said Toohey. He .walked away, his steps creaking on the gravel in the si- lence, sharp and even, like the cracks of an engine's pistons.

He felt the pressure of a metal ring against his skin-and noth- ing else. He might have been holding a lead pipe or a piece of jewelry; it was just a small circle without significance. \"I am go- ing to die,\" he said aloud-and yawned. He felt no relief, no despair, no fear. The moment of his end would not grant him even the dignity of seriousness. It was an anonymous moment; a few minutes ago, he had held a tooth- brush in that hand; now he held a gun with the same casual in- difference. One does not die like this, he thought. One must feel a great joy or a healthy terror. One must salute one's own end. Let me feel a spasm of dread and I'll pull the trigger. He felt nothing. He shrugged and lowered the gun. He stood tapping it against the palm of his left hand. People always speak of a black death or a red death, he thought; yours, Gail Wynand, will be a gray death. Why hasn't anyone ever said that this is the ultimate hor- ror? Not screams, pleas or convulsions. Not the indifference of a clean emptiness, disinfected by the fire of some great disaster. But this-a mean, smutty little horror, impotent even to frighten. You can't do it like that, he told himself, smiling coldly; it would be in such bad taste. He walked to the wall of his bedroom .. His penthouse was built above the fifty-seventh floor of a great residential hotel which he owned, in the center of Manhattan; he could see the whole city below him. The bedroom was a glass cage on the roof of the penthouse, its walls and ceiling made of huge glass sheets. There were dust-blue suede curtains to be pulled across the walls and enclose the room when he wished; there was nothing to cover the ceiling. Lying in bed, he could study the stars over his head, or see flashes of lightning, or watch the rain smashed· into furious, 390"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":". glittering 1>. nbursts in mid-air above him, against the unseen pro- tection. He liked to extinguish the lights and pull all the curtains open when he lay in bed with a woman. \"We are fornicating in the sight of six million people,\" he would tell her. . He was alone now. The curtains were open. He stood looking at the city. It was late and the great riot of lights below him was beginning to die down. He thought that he did not mind having to look at the city for many more years and he did not mind never seeing it again. He leaned against the wall and felt the cold glass through the thin, dark silk of his pyjamas. A monogram was embroidered in white on his breast pocket: GW, reproduced from his handwrit- ing, exactly as 'he signed his initials with a single imperial mo- tion. · }Jeople said that Gail Wynand's greatest deception, among many, Was his appearance. He looked like the decadent, overperfec~ end product of a long line of exquisite breeding- and everybody knew that he came from the gutter, He was tall, too slender for physical beauty, as if all his flesh and muscle had been bred away. It was not necessary for him to stand erect in or- der to convey an impression of hardness. Like a piece of expen- sive steel; he bent, slouched and made people conscious, not of his pose, but of the ferocious spring that could snap him straight at any moment. This hint was all he needed; he seldom stood quite straight; he lounged about. UndeJ;\" any clothes he wore, it gave him an air of consummate elegance. His face did not belong to modem civilization, but to ancient Rome; the face of an eternal patrician. His hair, streaked with gray, was swept smoothly back from a high forehead. His skin was pulled tight over the sharp bones of his face; his mouth was long and thin; his eyes, under slanting eyebrows, were pale blue and photographed like two sardonic white ovals. An artist had asked him once to sit for a painting of Mephistopheles; Wynand had laughed, refusing, and the artist had watched sadly, because the laughter made the face perfect for his purpose. He slouched casually against the glass pane of his bedroom, the weight of a gun on his. palm. Today, he thought; what was to- day? Did anything happen that would help me now and give meaning to this moment? Today had been like so many other days behind him that ·par- ticular features were hard to recognize. He was fifty-one years old, and it was the middle of October in the year 1932; he was certain of this much; the rest took an effort of memory. He had awakened and dressed at six o'clock this morning; he had never slept more than four hours on any night of his adult life. He descended to his dining room where breakfast was seryed to him. His penthouse, a small structure, stood on the edge 'of a vast roof landscaped as a garden.

He worked alone at his desk for three hours, reading and making brief notes with a large blue pencil .across the printed· pages. The notes looked like a spy's shorthand; nobody could decipher them except the dry, middle- aged secretary who entered the study when Wynand left it. He had not beard her voice in five years, but no ·conununication be- tween them was necessary.· When be returned to his study in the evening, the secretary. and the pile of papers were gone; on his desk be found neatly typed pages containing the things be had wished to be recorded from his morning's work. ~ At ten o'clock be arrived at the Banner Building, a plain, grimy structure in an undistinguished neighborhood of lower Manhattan.

Nobody could predict what department he would choose to visit or when. He could appear at any moment in any part of the building-and his presence was as unobtrusive as an electric shock. The employees tried to obey the rule as best they could; but they preferrecl three hours of overtime to ten min- utes of working under his silent observation. This morning, in his office, be went over the proofs of, the Banner's Sunday editorials. He slashed blue lines across the spreads be wished elimiilated. He did not sign his initials; every- body knew that only Gail Wynand could make quite that kind of blue slashes, lines that seemed to rip the authors of the copy out of existence.

A meeting of the board of directors of the Wynand Enterprises, Inc., had been scheduled for eleven-thirty· that ·morning. The Wynlllid Enterprises consisted of twenty~two newspapers, seven magazines, three news services and two newsreels. Wynand owned seventy-five percent of the stock. The directors were not certain of their functions or purpose. Wynand had ordered meetings of the board always to start on time, whether he was present or not. Today· he entered the board room at twelve twenty-five. A distinguished old gentleman was making a speech. The directors were not allowed to stop or notice Wynand's pres- ence. He walked to the empty chair at the head • of the long ma- hogany table and sat down. No one turned to him; it was as if the chair had just been occupied by a ghost whose existence they dared not admit. He listened silently for fifteen minUtes. He got up in the middle of a sentence and left the room as he had en- tered. . . . On a large table in his office he spi'e!ld out maps of Stoneridge, his new real-estate venture, and spent half an hour discussing it with two of his agents. He had purchased a vast tract of land on Long Island, which was to be .converted into the Stoneridge De- velopment, a new community of small home owners, every curb- stone, street and house to be built by Gail Wynand. The few people who knew of his real-estate activities had told him that he was crazy. It was a year when no one thought of building. But Gail Wynand had made his fortune on decisions which ·people called crazy. . The architect to design Stoneridge had not been chosen. News of the project had seeped into the starved profession, For weeks Wynand had refused to read letters or answer calls from the best architects of the country and their friends. He refused once more when, at the end of his conference, his secretary informed him that Mr. Ralston Holcombe most urgently requested two minutes of his time on the telephone. . · When the agents were gone, Wynand pressed a button on his 393"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"desk, summoning Alvah Scaaet Scarret entered the office, smil- ing happily.

Just a lot of peo- ple amusing themselves.\" \"I don't like to have anyone amusing himself on my paper.\" \"Yes, Gail.\" At two o'clock Wynand arrived, as guest of honor, at a lunch- -\\ eon given by a National Convention of Women's Clubs. He sat at the right of the chairwoman in an echoing banquet hall filled with the odors of corsages-gardenias and sweet pellS-'-and of fried chicken. After luncheon Wynand spoke. The Convention advocated careers for married women; the Wynand papers had fought against the employment of married women for many years. Wynand spoke for twenty minutes and said nothing at all; but he conveyed the impression that he supported every senti- ~ ment expressed at the meeting. Nobody had ever been able to ex- plain the effect of Gail Wynand on an audience, particularly an audience of women. He did nothing spectacular; his voice was low, metallic, inclined to sound monotonous; he was too correct, in a manner that was almost deliberate satire on correctness. Yet he conquered ail listeners. People said it was his subtle, enor- mous virility; it made the courteous voice speaking about school, home and family sound as if he were making love to every old hag present. _ Retnrning to his office, Wynand stopped in the city room. Standing at a tall desk, a big blue pencil in his hand, he wrote on a huge sheet of plain print stock, in letters an inch high, a bril- liant, ruthless editorial denouncing all advocates of careers for women. The.GW at the end stood like a streak of blue. flame. He did not read the piece over-he never needed to-but threw it on ilie desk of the nrst editor in sight and walked out of the room. Late in the afternoon, when Wynand was ready to leave his of- flee, his secretary announced that Ellsworth· Toohey requested the privilege of seeing 'biro. \"Let him in,\" said Wynand. Toohey entered, a cautious half-smile on his face, a smile mocking himself and his boss, but with a delicate sense of bal- ance, sixty percent of the mockery directed at himself. He knew that Wynand did not want to see him, and being received was not in his favor. Wynand sat behind his desk, his face courteously blank. Two diagonal ridges stood out faintly on his forehead, parallel with his slanting eyebrows. It was a disconcerting peculiarity which his face ·assumed at times; it gave the effect of a double expo- sure, an ominous emphasis. 395"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"\"Sit down, Mr. Toohey.

''Ob, rm much more presumptuo.us than that, Mr. Wynand,'' said Toohey gaily. \"I didn't come to ask for your services, but to offer you mine.\" \"In what matter?'' \"Stoneridge.\" _ _ The diagonal lines stood out sharper on Wynand's forehead. \"Of what use can a newspaper columnist be to Stoneridge?'' \"A newspaper columnist-none, Mr. Wynand. But an architec- tural expert ... \"Toohey let his voice trail into a mocking ques- tion mark. If Toohey's eyes bad not been fiXed insolently on Wynand's, be would have been ordered out of the office at once. But the glance told Wynand that Toohey knew to what extent he bad been plagued_ by people recommending architects and bow bani he bad tried to avoid them; and that Toohey bad outwitted biro by .obtaining this intfniew for a pwpo!IJ' Wynand bad not ex- pected. The impertinence of it amused Wynand, as Toohey bad known it would. · \"All right,- Mr. Toohey.

It just happens to be the truth.\" Wynand would not help biro out. \"I presumed to come here because I felt it was my duty to give you my opinion. No, not a moral duty. Call it an esthetic one. I know that you demand the best in anything you 'do. For a project o( the size you have in mind there's not another architect living who can equal Peter Keating in efficiency, taste, original- ity, imagination. That, Mr. Wynand, is my sincere opinion.\" \"I quite believe you.\" · \"You do?'' \"Of course. But, Mr. Toohey, why should I consider your opin- ion?'' ''Well, after all, I am your architectural expert!\" He could not keep the edge of anger out of his'. voice. . \"My dear, ·Mr. Toohey, don't confuse me with my readers.\" After a moment, Toohey leaned back and spread his hands out in lau8hing helplessness. . .

Toohey, blinked, uni>repared. ''Really, Mr. Toohey, I owe you an apology, if, by allowing my tastes to become so well known, I caused you to be so crude.

I have no desire what- ever to meet Mrs. Peter Keating.\" \"I didn't think you would have, Mr. Wynand. Not on my un- supported suggestion. I foresaw that several hours ago. In fact, as early as this morning. So I took the liberty of preparing for my- seJf another chance to discuss this with you. I took the liberty of sending you a present. When you get home tonight, you will find my gift there. Then, if you feel that I was .justified in expecting you to do so, you can telephone me and I shall come over at once so that you will be able to tell me whether you wish to meet Mrs. Peter Keating or not.\" ''Toohey, this is unbelievable, but I believe you're offering me a bribe.\" ''I am.\" \"You know, that's the sort of stunt you should be allowed' to get away with completely-or lose your job for.\" ''I shall rest upon your opinion of my present tonight.\" \"All right, Mr. Toohey; I'll look at your present.\" Toohey bowed and turned to go. He was at the door ·when Wynand added: \"You know, Toohey, one of these days you'll bore me.\" \"I shall endeavor not to do so until the right time,\" said Toohey, bowed again and went out. When Wynand returned to his home, he had forgotten all about Ellsworth Toohey. That evening, in his penthouse, Wynand had dinner with a woman who had a white face, 8oft brown hair and, behind her, three centuries of fathers and brothers who would have killed a man for a hint of the things which Gail Wynand had experienced with her. 397"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"The line of her arm. w~n she taist;d a crystal goblet of water to her lips, was as perfect as the lines of the silver candelabra produced by a matchless talent-and Wynand observed it with the same appreciation. The candlelight flickering on the planes of her face made a sight of such beauty that he wished she were· not alive, so that he could look, say nothing and think what he pleased. - \"In a month or·two, Gail,\" she said, smiling lazily, \"when it gets really cold and nasty, let's take the 1 Do and sail somewhere straight into the sun, as we did last winter.\" 1 Do was the nanie ofWynand'syaeht He had never explafued that name to anyone. ·Many women had questioned him about it. This woman had questioned him before. Now, as he remained si- lent, she asked it again: · \"By the way, darling, what does it mean-the name of that wonderful ~d-scow of yours?'' ''It's a question I don't answer,\" he said. \"One of them.\" \"Well, $llaD I get my wardrobe ready for the cruise?'' ''Green is your best color. It looks \"'ell at sea. I love to watch what it does to your hair and your anns. I shaD miss the sight of your naked arms against green silk. Because tonight is the last time.\" · · Her fingers lay still on the stem of the glass. Nothing had given her a hint that tonight was to be the last time. But she knew that these words were all he needed to end it. All of Wynand's women had known that they were to expect an end like this and that it was not to be discussed. After a while, she asked, her voice low: \"What reason, Gail?'' ''The obvious one.\" He reached into his pocket and took out a diamond bracelet; it flashed a cold, brilliant fire in the candlelight: its heavy links hung limply in his fingers. It had no case, no wrapper. He tossed it across the table. \"A memorial, my dear,\" he said. \"Much more valuable than that which it commemorates.\" · The bracelet hit the goblet and made it ring, a thin, sharp cry, as if the glass had screamed for the woman. The woman made no sound. He knew that it Wali horn'ble, because she was the kind to whom one did not offer such gifts at such moments, just as aD those other women had been; and because she would not refuse, as all the others had not refused. \"Thank you, Gail,\" she said, clasping the bracelet about her wrist, not looking at him across the candles. Later, when they had walked into the drawing room, she stopped and the glance between her long eyelashes moved to- . ward the darkness where the stairway to his bedroom began. \"To let me earn the memorial, Gail?'' she asked, her voice flat. 398"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"He shook his head. \"I had really intended that,\" he said. \"But I'm tired.\" When she had gone, he stood in the hall and thought that she suffered, that the suffering was real, but after a while none of it would be real to her, except the bracelet. He could no longer re- member the time when such a thought had the power to give him bitterness. When he recalled that he, too, was concerned in the event of this evening, he felt nothing, except wonder why he had not done this long ago. He went to his library. He sat reading for a few hours. Then he stopped. He stopped short, without reason, in the middle of an important sentence. He had no desire to read on. He had no de- sire ever to make another effort. Nothing had happened to him-a happening is a positive real- ity, and no reality could ever make him helpless; this was SOII,le enormous negative-as if everything had been wiped out. leaving a senseless emptiness, faintly indecent because it seemed so ordi- nary, so unexciting, like murder wearing a homey smile. Nothing was gone-except desire; no, more than that-the root. the desire to desire. He thought that a man who loses his eyes still retains the concept of sight; -but he had heard of a ghastlier blindness-if the brain centers controlling vision are de- stroyed, one loses even the memory of visual perception. He dropped the book and stood up. He had no wish to remain on that spot; he had no wish to move from it. He thought that he should go to sleep. It was much too early for him, but he could get up earlier tomorrow. He went to his bedroom, he took a shower, he put on his pyjamas, Then he opened a drawer of his dresser and saw the gun he always kept there. It was the imme- diate recognition, the sudden stab of interest, that made him pick it up. It was the lack of shock, when he thought he would kill himself, that convinced him he should. The thought seemed so simple, like an argument not worth contesting. Like a bromide. Now he stood at the glass wall, stopped by that very simplic- ity. One could make a bromide of one's life, he thought; but not of one's death. . He walked to the bed and sat down, the gun hanging in his hand. A man about to die, he thought, is supposed to see his whole life in a last flash. I see nothing. But I could make myself see it. I could go over it again, by force. Let me find in it either the will to live on or the reason to end it now. Gail Wynand, aged twelve, stood in the darkness under a bro- ken piece of wall on the shore of the Hudson, one arm swung back, the fist closed, ready to strike, waiting. The stones under his feet rose to the remnant of a comer; one side of it hid him from the street; there was nothing behind the 399"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"other side but a sheer drop to the river. An unlighted, unpaved stretch of waterfront lay before him, sagging structures and empty spaces of sky, warehouses; a crooked cornice hanging somewhere over· a window with a malignant light. In a moment he would have to fight-and he knew it would be for his life. He stood still. His closed fist, held ·down and back, seemed to clutch invisible wires that stretched to every key spot of his lanky, fleshless body, under the ragged pants and shirt, to the long, swollen tendon of his bare ann, to the taut cords of his neck. The wires· seemed to quiver; the body was motionless .. He was like a new sort of lethal instrUment; if a finger were to touch any part of him, it would release the trigger. He knew that the leader of the boys' gang was looking for him and that the leader would not come alone. Two of the boys he ex- pected fought with knives; one hitd a killing to his credit. He waited for them, his· own pockets empty. He was the youngest member of the gang and the last to join. The leader had said that he needed a lesson. It had started over the looting of the barges on the river, which the gang was planning. The leader had decided that the job would be done at night. The gang had agreed; all but Gail Wynand; Gail Wynand had explained, in a slow, contemptuous voice, that the Little Plug-Uglies, farther down the river, had tried the same. stunt last week and bad left six members in the hands of the- cops, plus two in the cemetery; the job had to be done at. daybreak, when no one would expect it. The g~g boo~ him. It made no. difference. Gail Wynand was not good at taking ordets. He recognized nothing but the accuracy of his own judg- ment. So the leader wished to settle the issue once and for all. The three boys walked so soffiy that the people behind the thin walls they passed could not hear their steps. Gail Wynand heard them a block away. He did not move in his comer; only his wrist stiffened a little. When .the moment was right, he leaped. He leaped straight into space; Without thought of landing, as if a catapult had sent him on a t'Iigkt of miles. His chest struck the bead of one enemy, his stomach :another, his feet smashed it.tto the chest of the third. The four of them went down. When the three lifted their faces, Gail Wynand was unrecognizable; they saw a whirl suspended in the air above them, and something darted at them out .of the whirl with a scalding touch. · He had nothing but his· two fists;. they had five fists and a knife on their side; it did not seem to· count. They heard their blows landing with a thud as on bard rubber; they felt the break in the thrust of their knife, which told that it had been stopped and had cut its way out. But the thing they were fighting was invulnera- ble. He had no time to·feel; be was too fast; pain could not catch up With him; he seemed to leave it hanging in the air over the 400"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"spot where it had. hit him and where he w~ no longer in the next second. He seemed to have a motor between his shoulder blades to propel his arms in two circles; only the circles were visible; the arms had vanished like the spokes of a speeding wheel. The cir- cle landed each time, and stopped whatever it had landed upon, without a break in its spin. One boy saw his knife disappear in Wynand's shoulder; he saw the jerk of the shoulder that sent the knife slicing down through Wynand's side and flung it out at the belt It was the last thing the boy saw. Something happened to his chin and he did not feel it when the back of his bead struck against a pile of old bricks. · For a long time the two others fought the centrifuge that was now spattering red drops against the walls around them. But it was no use. They were not fighting a man. They were fighting a bodiless human will. . When they gave up, groaning among the bricks, Gail Wyriand said in a normal voice: ''We'll pull it off at daybreak,\" and walked away. From that moment on, he was the leader of the gang. The looting of the barges was done at daybreak, tWo days later, and came off with brilliant success. Gail WyiJ.and lived with his father in the basement of an old house in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. His father was alongshore- man, a tall, silent, .illiterate man who had never gone to school. His ·own father and his grandfather were of the sap1e kind, and they knew of nothing but poverty in their family. But somewhere far back in the line there had been a root of aristocracy, the glory of some noble ancestor and then some. tragedy, long since forgot- ten., . that had brought the descendants tv the gutter. Something about all the Wynands-in tenement, saloon and jail-did li.ot fit their surroundings. Gail's father was known on the waterfront as the Duke. Gail's mother had died of consumption when he was two years old. He was an only _son. He knew vaguely that there had been some great drama in liis father's marriage; he had seen a picture of his mother; she did not look and. she was not dressed like the women of their neighborhood; she was very beautiful. All life had gone out of his father when she died. He loved. Gail; but it was the kind of devotion that did not require two sentences a week. Gail did not ·look like his mother or father; He was a throw- back to something no one could quite figure out; the distance had to be reckoned, not in generations, but in centuries. He was al- ways too tall for his age, and too thin. The boys called him Stretch Wynand. Nobody knew what he used for muscles; they knew only that be used it. He had worked at one job after another since early childhood. 401"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"For a long while he .sold newspaper& on .street corners.

Yeah?\" said the bou. ••nmow it will work,'.' ·said Wynand. \"Well, you don't run things around here,\" said the boss. \"You're a fool,\" said Wynand. He lost the job. He worked in a grocery store. ·He ran errands, he swept the soggy wooden floor, he sorted out barrels of·rotting vegetables, he helped to wait on customers, patiently weighing a pound of flour or filling a pitcher with milk from. a huge can. It was like using a steamroller to press handkerchiefs. But he set his teeth and stuck to it. One day, he explained to the grocer what a good idea it would be to put nillk up in bottles, like whisky. \"You shut your trap and go wait on Mrs. Sullivan there,\" said the grocer, \"don't you tell me nothing I don't know about my business. You don~t run things around here .. \" He waited on Mrs. Sullivan and said nothing. · He worked in a poolroom; He cleaned spittoons and washed up after drun,ks. He heard and saw things that gave him immunity from astonishment for the rest of his life. He made his greatest effort and learned to keep silent; to keep the place others de- scribed as his place, to accept ineptitude as his master-and to wait No one had ever heard him speak of what he felt. He felt _ many emotions toward his fellow men, but respect was not one of themr. · · He worked as bootblack on a ferryboat. He was shoved and or- dered around by every bloated horse trader, by every drunken deck hand aboard. If he spoJce,. he heard some thick voice an- swering: \"You don't run things around here.\" But be liked this job. When he had no customers, he stood at the rail and looked at Manhattan. He looked !lt the yellow .boards of new houses, at the vacant lots, at the cranes and derricks, at the few towers ris- ing in the distance. He thought of what should be built and what should be destroyed, of the space, the promise and what could be made of it A hoarse shout-\"Hey, boy!\"-interrupted him. He went back to his bench and bent obediently over some muddy shoe. The customer saw only a small head of light brown hair and two thin, capable hands. . On foggy evenings, under a gas lantern on a street comer, no- body noticed the slender figure leaning against a lamppost, the aristocrat of the Middle Ages, the timeless patrician whose every instinct cried that he should command, whose swift brain told him why he had the right to do so, the feudal baron created to rule-but born to sweep floors and take orders. He had taught himself to read and write at the age of five, by asking questions. He read everything he found. He could not tol- erate the inexplicable. He had to understand anything known to 402"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"anyone. The emblem of his childhood-the coat-of-arms he de- vised for himself in place of the one lost for him centuries ago- was the question mark. No one ever needed to explain anything to.him twice. He learned his first mathematics from the engineers laying sewer pipes. He learned. geography from the sailors on the waterfront. He learned civics from the politicians at a local club that was a gangsters' hangout. He had never gone to church or to school. He was twelve when he walked into a church. He listened to a sermon on patience and humility. He never came back. He was thirteen when he decided to see what education was like and enrolled at a public school. His father said nothing about this de- cision, as he said nothing whenever Gail came home battered af- ter a gang fight During his ftrst week at school the teacher called on Gail Wynand constantly-it was sheer pleasure to her, because he al- ways knew the answers. When he trusted his superiors and their purpose, he obeyed like a Spartan, imposing on himself the kind of discipline he demanded of his own subjects in the gang. But the force of his will was wasted: within a week he saw that he needed no effort to be first in the class. After a month the teacher stopped· noticing his presence; it seemed pointless, he always knew his lesson and she had to concentrate on the slower, duller children. He sat, unflinching, througb hours that dragged like chains, while the teacher repeated and chewed and rechewed, sweating to force some spark of intellect from vacant eyes and mumbling voices. At the end of two months, reviewing the rudi- ments of history which she had tried to pound into her class, the teacher asked: \"And how many original states were there in the Union?\" No hands were raised. Then Gail Wynand's arm went up. The teacher nodded to him. He rose. \"Why,\" he asked, \"should I swill everything down ten times? I know all that.\" \"You are not the.only one in the class,\" said the teacher. He ut- tered an expression that struck her white and made her blush fif- teen· minutes later, when she grasped it fully. He walked to the door. On the threshold he turned to add: \"Oh yes. There were · thirteen original states.\" That was the last of his formal education. There were people in Hell's Kitchen who never ventured be- yond its boundaries, and others who seldom stepped our of the tenement in which they were born. But Gail Wynand often w:ent for a walk through the best streets of the city. He felt no bitter- ness against the world of wealth, no envy and no fear. He was simply curious and he felt at home on Fifth Avenue, just as any- where else. He walked past the stately mansions, his hands in his pockets, his toes sticking out of flat-soled shoes. People glared at him, but it ,had no effect. He· passed by and left behind him the feeling that he belonged on this street and they didn't. He wanted nothing, for the _!ime being, except to understand. 403"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"He wanted to know wQa.t made these people different frQin those in his neighbOrhOod. It was not the clothes, the camage5 or the banks tbirt caught his notice; it was the books. People in his neighborhood bad clo~es. horse wagons and money; degrees were inessential; but they did not read books. He decicled to.learn what was read by the people on Fifth Avenue. One day, he sa:w a lady waiting in a carriage at the curb;· he knew she was a lady-his judgment on such matters was more acute than the dis- crimination of the Social RegiSter; she was reading a book. He leaped to the steps of the carriage, snatched the book and ran away. It would have takeri swifter, slimmer men than the cops to catch him. It was a volume of Herbert Spencer. He went· through a quiet . agony trying to read it to the end. He read it to the end. He un- derstood one quarter of what he bad read. But this started him on a proeess which he pursued with a systeJQatic, fist-clenched de- . temiination. WithOut advice, assistance·or plan, he began reading an incongruous assortment of books; he would find some passage which he could not understand in one book, and he would get an- other on ·that subject. He branched out erratically in· all direc- tions; he read volumes of special-zed erudition first, and high-school primers afterward. There was no order in his read- ing; but there was order in what remained of it in his mind. He discovered the reading room ot the Public library and he went there for a while-to study the layout. Then, one day, at various times, a succession of young boys, painfully combed and urtcQDvincingly washed, came to visit the reading room. They were thin when they came, but not· when they left. That evening Gail Wynand bad a Sinalllibrary of his own in the corner of his basement. His gang bad executed his orders without protest. It was a scandalous assignment; no self-respecting gang bad ever looted anything as pointless as boob. But Stretch Wynand bad given the ~ one did not argue· with Stretch Wynand. He was fifteen when be was found, one morning, in the gutter, · a mass of bleeding pulp, both legs broken, beaten by some drunken longshoreman. He was unconscious when found. But be bad been conscious that night,- after the beating. He bad been left alone in a dark alley. He had seen a light around the corner. No- body knew bow he could .have managed to drag himself around that corner; but be had; .they saw the long smear of blood on the pavement afterward. He bad crawled, able to move. nothing but his amis. He had knocked against the bottom of a door. It was a saloon, still open. The saloonkeeper came out. It was the only time in his life that Gail Wynand. asked for help. The saloon- keeper looked at him with a flat, heavy glance, a glance that showed full consciousness of agony, of injustice-and a stolid, bovine indifference.

But when Pat MUlligan, police captain of his precinct, was framed, Wynand could not take it; because Pat Mulligan was the only honest man he bad ever met in his life. The Gazene was controlled by the powers that bad framed Mulligan. Wynand said nothing. He merely put in order in his mind such items of information he possessed as would blow the Gazene into hell. His job would be blown with it, but that did not matter; His decision contradicted every rule he had laid down for his career. But he did not think. It was one of the rare explosions that hit him at times, throwing ·him beyond caution, making of him a creature possessed by the single impulse to have his way, because the rightness of his way was so blindingly total. But. he knew that the destruction of the Gazene would be only a: first step. It was not enough to save Mulligan. For three years Wynand had kept one sDiall clipping, an edito- rial on Corruption, by the famous editor of a great newspaper. He bad kept it, • because it was the most beautiful tribute to integrity he bad ~ver .read. He took that clipping and went to see the great 406"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"editor. He would tell him about Mulligan and together they would beat the machine. He walked far across town, to the building of the famous pa- per. He had to walk. It helped to cqntro1 the fury within him. He was admitted into .the office of the editor-he had a way of get- ting admitted into places against all rules. He saw a fat man at a desk, with thin slits of eyes set close together. He did not intro- duce himself, but laid the clipping down on the desk and asked: \"Do you remember this?'' The editor glanced at the clipping, then at Wynand. It was a glance Wynand had seen before: in the eyes of the saloonkeeper who had slammed the door. ''How do you expect me to remember every piece of swill I write?'' asked the editor. After a moment, Wynand said: \"Thanks.\" It was the only time in his life that he felt gratitude to anyone. The gratitude was genuine-a payment for a lesson he would never need again. But even the editor knew there was somelhing very wrong in that short ''Thanks,\" and very frightening. He did not know that it had ·- been an obituary on Gail Wynand. Wynand walked back to the Gazette, feeling no anger- toward the editor or the politiCal machine. He felt only a furious- con- tempt for himself, for Pat Mulligan, for all integrity; he felt shame when he thought of those whose victims he ilitd Mulligan had been willing to become. He did not think ''victims\"4e thought \"suckers.\" He got 'back to the office and wrote a brilli8nt editorial blasting Captain Mulligan. \"Why, I thought you kinda felt sorry for the poor bastard,\" said his editor, pleased~ \"' don't feel sony for anyone,\" said Wynand. · Grocers and deck hands had not· appreciated Gail Wynand; politicians did. In his years on the paper he had learned how to get along with people. His face had .assumed the expreSsion it was to wear for the rest of his life: not quite a smile, but a mo- tionless look of irony directed at the whole world. People could presume that his mockery was intended for the parti~ things they wished to mock. Besides, it was pleasant to deal with a man untroubled by passion or sanctity. · . He was twenty-three when a rival political gang, intent on winning a municipal election and needing a newspaper to plug a certain issue, bought the Gazette. They bought it in the name of Gail Wyoand, who was to serve as a respectable front for the ma- chine. Gail Wynand became editor-in-chief. He plugged the. is- sue, he won the election for his bosses. Two years later, he smashed the gang, sent its leaders to the penitentiary, and re- mained as sole owner of the- Gazette. · His first act was to tear down the sign over the door of the building -and to throw out the paper;s old masthead. The Gazette became the New York Banner. His friends objected.· \"Publishel;s 407"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"don't change the name of a paper;\" they told him. \"This one does,\" he said. · The first campaign of the Banner was an appeal for money for a charitable cause. Displayed side by side, with an equal amount of space, the Banner ran two stories: one about a strug- gling young scientist, starving in a garret, working on a great invention; the other about a chambermaid, the sweetheart of an executed murderer, awaiting the birth of her illegitimate child. One story was illustrated with scientific diagrams; the other- with the picture of a loose-mouthed girl wearing a tragic ex- . pression and disarranged clothes. The Banner asked its readers to help both these unfortunates. It received nine dollars and forty-five cents for the young scientist; it received one thousand and seventy-seven dollars for the unwed mother. Gail Wynand called a meeting of his staff. He put down on the table the paper carrying both stories and the money collected for both funds. \"Is there anyone here who doesn't understand?\" he asked.· No one answered. He said: ''Now you all know the kind of paper the Banner is to be.\" The publishers of his time took pride in stamping their individ- · ual personalities upon their newspapers. Gail Wynand delivered his paper, body and soul, to the mob. The Banner assumed the appearance of a circus. poster in body, of a circus performance in soul. It accepted the same goal-to stun, to amuse and to collect admission. It bore the imprint, oot of one, but of a million men. \"Men differ in their virtues, if any,\" said Gail Wynand, ex- plaining his policy, \"but they are alike in their vices.\" He added, looking straight into the questioner's eyes: \"I am serving that which exists on this earth in greatest quantity. I am representing the majority-surely an act of virtue?\" The public asked for crime, scandal and sentiment. Gail WynancJ provided it. He gave people what they wanted, plus a justification for indulging the tastes of which they had been ashamed. The Banner presented murder, arson, rape, ·corruption-with an appropriate moral against each. There were three columns of details to one stick of moral. ''If you make peo- ple perform a noble duty, it bores them,\" said Wynand. ''If you · make them indulge themselves, it shames them. But combine the two-and you've got them.\" He ran stories about fallen girls, so- ciety divorces, foundling asylums, red-light districts, charity hos- pitals. \"Sex first,\" said Wynand. ''Tears second. Make them itch and make them cry-and you've got them.\" The Banner led great, .brave crusade~n issues that had no opposition. It exposed politician~ne step ahead of the Grand Jury; it attackea monopolies-in the name of the downtrodden; it mocked the rich and the successful-in the manner of those who could never be either. It overstressed the glamour of society- and presented society news with a subtle sneer.

Then Wynand called his staff together and told them: \"When in doubt about your work, remember that man's face. You're writing for him.\" \"But, Mr. Wynand,\" said a young editor, \"one can't remember his face.\" \"That's the point,'' said Wynand. . . - When the name of Gail Wynand became a threat in the pub- lishing_ world, a· group of-newspaper owners took him aside-at a city charity affair which all had to attend-and reproached him for what they called his debasement of the public taste. ''It is not - my function,\" said Wynand, \"to help people preserve a self- respect they haven't got. You give them what they profess to like in public. I give theiD what they really like. Honesty is the best policy, gentlemen, though not quite in the sense you were taUght to believe.\"- It was impOSsible for Wynand not to do a job well: Whatever his aim, his Ine&IJS were superlative. All the drive, the fon:e, the will bari'ed from the pages of his paper went into its lilaking. An exceptional talent was burned prodigally to achieve perfection in the unexceptional. A new religious faith could have been founded on the energy of spirit which he spent upon collecting lurid -stOries and smearing them across sheets of paper. The Banner was always first with the news. When an earth- quake occurred in South America and no communieations came from the stricken area, Wynand chartered a ·Jiner, sent a crew down to the scene and had extras on the streets of New York days ahead of--his competitors, extras with drawings that repre- sented flames, chasms and crushed bodies. When an S.O.S. was received . from a ship sinking in a storm off the Atlantic coast, Wynand himself sped to the scene ·with his crew, ahead of the 409"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Coast Guard; Wynand directed the ~ue and brought back an exclusive story with photograpbs of himself climbing a ladder over raging waves, a baby in his arms. When a Canadian village was. cut off t@m. the world by an avalanche, it was the Banner that sent a balloon to drop food and Bibles to the inhabitants. When a coal-mining CQmmunity was paralyzed by a strike, the Banll!!r opened soup-ki~bens and pgnted tmgic stories on the perils confronting the'miriers' pretty (faugbters under tbC preS$ure of poverty.

The lunatic recovemd miraculously two weeks after his capture, was re- leased, and sold to the Banner an expose o( the ill-treatment he bad suffered at the institution. It led to sweeping reforms. After- ward, some people said that the lunatic bad worked on the Ban- ner before his commitment It could never be proved. A fire broke out. in a SW-eatshop employing thirty young girls. Two of them perished in- the diSaster. Mary Watson, one of the survivors, gave the Banner an exclusive story about the exploita- tion they bad suffered .. It led· to a crusade against sweatshops, headed by the best wpmen of the city. The origin of the fire was never discovered. It was whispered that Mary Watson bad once been Evelyn Drake who wrote· for ·the Banner. It could not be 'pl'9Ved. . In the first years of the Banner's existence Gail Wynand spent more nights on his office couch than in hill .bedroom. The effort he demanded of his employees was bard to perform; the effort he demanded of himself was hard to believe. He drove them like an anny; he drove himself like a slave. He paid them well; he got nothing but his rent and meals. He lived in a furnished room at the time when his best reporters lived in suites at expensive ho- tels.· He spent money faster than it came in-ail.d he spent it all on the Banner. The paper was like a luxurious mistress whose ev- ery need was satisfied without inquiry about the price. . The Banner was first to get the newest typographical equip- ment. The Banner was last to get the best newspapermen-last, because it kept them. Wynand raided his competitors' city rooms; nobody could meet Ute salaries he offered. His procedure evolved into a simple formula. When a newspaperman received an invita- tion to call on Wynand, he took it as an insult to his journalistic in~ty, .but he came to the appoinbnenl He came, prepared to deliver a set of offensive condition$ on which he would accept the job, if at all. Wynand began the interview by stating the sal- ary he would pay. Then he added: ''You might wish, of course, 410"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"to discuss other conditions--\" and seeing the swallowing movement in the man's throat, concluded: \"No? Fine. Report to me on MQnday.\" When Wynand opened his second paper-in Philadelphia-the local publishers met him like European chieftains united against the invasion of Attila: The war that followed was as savage. Wynand laughed over it. No one could teach him anything about hiring thugs to highjack a paper's delivery wagons and beat up news vendors. Two of his competitors perished in the battle. The Wyiland Philadelphia Star survived. The rest was swift and simple like an epidemic. By the time he reached the age of thirty-five there were Wynand papers in all the key cities of the United States. By the time he was forty there were Wynand magazines, Wynand newsreels and most of the Wynand Enterprises, Inc. A great many activities, not publicized, helped to build his for- tune. He had forgotten nothing of his childhood, He remembered the things he had thought, standing as a bootblack at the rail of a ferryboat-the chances offered by a growing city. He bought real estate where no one expected it to become valuable, he built against all advice-and he ran hundreds into thousands. · He bought his way into a great many enterprises of all kinds. Some- times they crashed; ruining everybody concerned, save Gail Wynand. He staged a crusade against a shady streetcar monopoly and caused it to lose its franchise; the franchise was granted to a shadier group, controlled by Gail Wynand. He ex.posed a vicious attempt to corner the beef market in the Middle West-and left the field clear for another gang, operating under his orders. He was helped by a great many people who discovered that young Wynand was a bright fellow, worth using. He eXhibited a charming complaisance about being used. In each case, the peo- ple found tha~ they had been used instead-like the men who bought the Gazette for Gail Wynand. Sometimes he lost money on his, investments, ·coldly and with full intention. Through a series of untraceable steps he ruined many powerful men: the president of a bilnk, the head of an in- surance company, the owner of a steamship line, and others. No one could discover his motives. The men were not his competi- tors and he gained nothing from their destruction. ''Whatever that bastard Wynand is after,\" people said, \"it's not after money.\" Those who denounced him too persistently were run out of their professions: some in a few weeks, others many years later. There were occasions when he let insults pass unnoticed; there were occasions when he broke a man for an innocuous remark. One could never tell what he would avenge and what he would forgive. One day he noticed the brilliant work of a young reporter on 411"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"another paper and sent for him. The boy came, but the salary Wynand mentioned had no effect on him. \"I can't work for you, Mr. Wynand,\" he said with des{!!lmte earnestness, \"because you ... you have no ideals.\" Wynand's thin lips smiled. \"You can't escape human depravity, kid,\" he said gently. '\"flle boss you ·work for may have ideals, but he has to beg money and take or- derS from many contemptible people. I have no ideals-but I don't beg. Take your choice. There's no other.\" The boy went back to his paper. A year later he came to Wynand and asked if his offer were still open. Wynand said that it was. The boy had remained on the Banner ever since. He was the only one on the staff who loved Gail Wynand. Alvah Scarret, sole survivor of the original Gazette, had risen with Wynand. But one could not say that he loved Wynand-he merely clung to his boss with the automatic devotion of a rug under Wynand's feet. Alvah Scarret had never hated anything, and so was incapable of love. He was shrewd, competent and un- scrupulous in the innocent manner of one unable to gmsp the conception of a scruple. He believed everything he wrote and ev- erything written in the Banner. He could hold a belief for all of two weeks. He was invaluable to Wynand-as a barometer of public reaction. No one could say whether Gail Wynand had a private life. His hours away from the office had assumed the style of the Ban- ner's front page-but a style raised to a gmnd plane, as if he were still playing circus, only to a gallery of kings. He bought out the entire house for a great opem performance-and sat alone in the empty auditorium with his current mistress. He discovered a beautiful play by an unknown playwright and paid him a huge sum. to have the play performed once and never again; Wynand was the sole spectator at the single perfollDllJlce; the script was burned next morning. When a distinguished society woman asked him to contribute to a worthy charity cause, Wynand handed her a signed blank check-and laughed, confessing that the amount she dared to fill in was less than he would have given otherwise. He bought some kind of Balkan throne for a penniless pretender whom he met in a speak-easy and never bothered to see afterward; he often referred to \"my valet, my chauffeur and my king.\" At night, dressed in a shabby suit bought for nine dollars, Wynand would often ride the subways and wander through the dives of slum districts, listening to his public. Once, in a base- ment beer joint, he heard a truck driver denouncing Gail Wynand as the worst exponent of capitalistic evils, in a language of col- orful accuracy. Wynand agreed with him and helped him out with a few expressions of his o~n. from his Hell's Kitchen vocabu- lary. Then Wynand picked up a copy of the Banner left by some- one on a table, tore his own photogmph from page 3, clipped it 412"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"to a hundred-dollar bill, handed it to the truck driver and walked out before anyone could utter a word. The succession of his mistresses was so rapid that it ceased to be gossip. It was said that he never enjoyed a woman unless he had bought her-and that she had to be the kind who could not be bought. He kept the details of his life secret by making it glaringly public as a whole. He had delivered himself to the crowd; he was anyone's property, like a. monument in a park, like. a bus stop sign, like the pages of the Banner. His photographs appeared in his papers more often than picture~ of movie s~. He had been photographed in all kinds of clothes, on every imaginable occa- sion. He had never been photographed naked, but his readers felt as if he had. He derived no pleasure from personal publicity; it was merely a matter of policy to which he submitted; Every cor- ner of his penthouse had been reproduced in his papers and mag- azines. \"Every bastard in· the country knows the inside of my icebox and bathtub,\" he said. One phase of his life, however, was little known and never mentioned. The top floor of the building under his penthouse was his private art gallery. It was locked. He had never ildmitted any- one, except the caretaker. A few people knew about it. Once a French ambassador asked him for permission to visit it. Wynand refused. Occasionally, not often, he would descend to his gallery and remain there for hours. The things he collected were chosen by standards. of his own, He had famous mastetpieces; he had canvases by unknown artists; he rejected the works of immortal names for which he did not care. The estimates set by collectors and the matter of great signatures were of no concern to him. The art dealers whom he patronized reported that his judgment was that of a master. One· night his valet saw Wynand returning from. the art gallery below and was shocked by the expression of his face; it was a look of suffering, yet the face seemed ten years younger. \"Are you ill, sir?\" he asked. Wynand looked at him indifferently and said: \"Go to bed.\" \"We could make a swell spread for the Sunday scandal sheet out of your art gallery,\" said Alvah Scarret wistrully. \"No,\" said Wynand. \"But why, Gail?\" \"Look, Alvah, Every man on earth has a soul of his own that nobody can state at. Even the convicts in a penitentiary and the freaks in a side show. Everybody but me. My soul is spread in your Sunday scandal sheet-in three- color process. So I must have a substitute-even if it's only a locked room and a few objects _not to be pawed.\" It was a long process and there had been premonitory signs, but Scarret did not notice a certain new trait in Gail Wynand's character until Wynand was forty-five. Then it became apparent to many. Wynand lost interest in breaking industrialists and fi- 413"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"nanciers. He found a new kind of yjctim. People, coUld not tell whether it was a sport, a mania or a systematic pursuit They thought it was horrible, because it seemed so vicious and point- less. It began with the case of Dwight Carson. Dwight Carson WaS a talented young writer who had achieved the spotless reputation of a man passionately devoted to his convictions. He upheld the cause of the individual against the masses. He wrote for maga- zines of great prestige and small circubltion, which were no threat to Wynand. Wynand bought Dwight Carson. He forced ·Carson to write a column in the Banner, dedicated to preaching the superiority of the masses over the man of genius. It was a bad column, dull and unconvincing; it made many people angry. It was a waste of space and of a big salary. Wynand insisted on contiJiuing it. Even Alvah Scarret was shocked by Carson's apostasy. \"Any- body else, Gail,\" he said, \"but, honest, I didn't expect it of Car- soil.\" Wynand laughed; he laughed too long, as if he could not stop it; his laughter had an edge of hysteria. Sc8rret frowned; he did not like the sight ·of Wynand being unable to control an emo- tion; it contradicted everything be ·knew of Wynand; it gave ~eta funny feeling· of apprehension, like the sight of a tiny ~ in a so6d wall; the crack could not possibly endanger the wall-except ~tit had no busin~ being there. A few months later Wynand bought a young writer from a rad- ical magazine, a man known for his honesty, and put him to work on a series of articles glorifying exceptional men and damning the masses. That, too, made a great many of his readers angry. He continued it. He seemed not to care any lo~er about the del- icate signs of effect on circtilation .. He hired a sensitive poet to cover baseball games. He hired an art expert to handle financial news. He got a socialist to defend factory o~rs and a conservative to champion labor. He forced an atheist to write on the glories of religion. He made a disci- pHned scientist proclaim the superiority of mystical intuition over the scientific method. He gave a great symphony conductor a munificent yearly income, for no work at all, on the sole condi- tion that he never conduct an orchestra again. . Some of these men haCI refused, at first But they surrendered when they found themselves on the edge of bankruptcy through a series of untraceable circumstances within a few years. Some of the men were famous, others obscure. Wynand showed no in- terest in the previous standing of his prey. He showed no interest in men of glittering success who had commercialized their ca- reers and held no particular .be6efs of any kind. His victims had a single attribute in common: their immaculate integrity. Once they were broken, Wynand continued to pay them scru- pulously. But he felt no further concern for them and no desire to 414"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"see them again. Dwight Carson became a dipsomaniac. Two men became drug addicts. One committed suicide. This last. was too much for Scarret. \"lsn't.it going too far, Gail?\" he asked. \"That was practically murder.\" \"Not at all,\" said Wynand, \"I was merely an outside circumstance. The cause was in him. If light- ning strikes a rotten tree and it cOllapses, it's not the fault of the lightning.\" \"But what do you call a healthy tree?\" \"They don't exist, Alvah,\"· said Wynand cheerfully, \"they don't exist.\" · Alvah Scarret never asked Wynand for an explanation of this new pursuit. By some dim instinct Scarret guessed a little of the reason· behind it. Scarret shrugged and laughed, telliilg people that it was nothing to worry about, it was just \"a safety valve.'' Only two men underst.ood Gail Wynand: Alvah Scarret- partially; EllswOrth Toohey....:.COmpletely. Ellsworth Toohey-who wished, above all, to avoid a quarrel with Wynand at ~t time-could not refrain from a feeling of re- sentment, because Wynand had not chosen him· as a victim. He almost wished Wynand would try to corrupt him, no matter what the consequences. But Wynand seldom noticed his existence. Wynand had never been afraid of death. Thiough the years the thought of suicide had occurred to him, not as an intention, but as one of the many possibilities among the chances of life. He examined it indifferently, with polite curiosity, as he examined. any possibility-and then forgot it. He had known moments of blank exhaustion when his will deserted him. He had always cured himself by a few hours in his art gallery. Thus he .reached the age offifty-one, and a day when nothing of co11sequence happened to him, yet the evening Jound him · without desire to take a step farther: Gail Wynand sat on the edge of the bed, slumped forward, his elbows on his knees, the gun on the palm of his hand. · Yes; he told himself, there's an answer there somewhere. But I don't want to know it. I don't want to know it. · And because he felt a pang of dread at. the root of this desire not to examine his life further, he knew that he would not die to- night. As long as he still feared something, he had a foothold on living; even if it meant only moving forward to an unknown di- · saster. The thought of death gave him nothing. The thought of living gave him a slender alms-the hint of fe~. He moved his hand, weighing the gun. He smiled, a faint smile ·of derision. No, he thought, that's not for you. Not yet. You still have the sense of not wanting to die senselessly. You were stopped by that. Even that is a remnant-of something. He ~ossed th~ gun aside on the bed, knowing that the moment was past and the thing was of. no danger to him any longer. He got up. He felt no elation; he felt tired; but he was back iii his 415"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"normal course. There were no problems, except to finish this day quickly and go to sleep. · He went down to his study to get a drink. When he switched on the light in the study, he saw Toohey's present. It was a huge, vertical crate, standing by his desk. He had seen it earlier in the evening. He had thought \"What the hell,\" and forgotten all about it. He poured himself a drink and stood sipping it slowly. The crate was too large to escape his field of vision, and as he drank he tried to guess what it could possibly contain. It was too tall and slender for a piece of furniture. He could not imagine what material property Toohey could wish to send him; he had ex- pected something less tangible-a small envelope containing a hint at some sort of blackmail; so many people had tried to blackmail him so unsuccessfully; he did think Toohey would have more sense than that. By the time· he finished his drink, he had found no plausible explanation for the crate. It annoyed him, like ·a stubborn cross- word puzzle. He had a kit of tools somewhere in a drawer of his desk. He found it and broke the crate open. It was Steven Mallory's statue of Dominique Francon. Gail Wynand walked to his desk and put down the pliers he held as if they were of fragile crystal. Then he turned and looked at the statue again. He stood looking at it for an hour. Then he wel)t to the telephone and dialed Toohey's numbei \"Hello?'' said Toohey's voice, its hoarse impatience confessing that he had been awakened out of sound sleep. \"All right. Come over,'~ said Wynand and hung up. Toohey arrived half an hour later. It was his first visit to Wynand's home. Wynand himself answered the doorbell, still dresSed in his pyjamas. He said nothing and walked into the study, Toohey following. The naked marble body, its head thrown back in exaltation, made the room look like a place that did not exist any longer: like the Stoddard Temple. Wynand's eyes rested on Toohey ex- pectantly, a heavy glance of suppressed anger. \"You want, of course, to know the name of the model?'' Toohey aslced, with just a hint of triumph in his voice. \"Hell, no,\" said Wynand. \"I want to .know the name of the sculptor.\" ' He wondered why Toohey did not like the question; there was something more than disappointment in Toohey's face. . \"The sculptor?'' said Toohey. \"Wait ... let me see ... I think I did know it. . . . It's Steven . . . or Stanley . . . Stanley some- thing or other ....

And you have.\" ''I'm glad to hear it, Mr. Wynand.\" \"If you wish to enjoy that, I'll tell you also that I hate seeing this come from you. I hate your having been able to appreciate it.

You intended me to under- stand that you won't-let me have this unless I grant an interview to Mrs. Peter KeatingT' - ''Why, no, Mr. Wynand. I've made you a present of it. I in- tended you only to understand that this is Mrs. Peter Keating.\" Wynand looked at the statue, then back at Toohey. ''Oh you damn fool!\" said Wynand softly. Toohey stared at him, bewildered. \"So you really did use this as a red lamp in a windowT' Wynand seemed relieved; he did not find it necessary to hold Toohey's glance now. ''That's better, Toohey. You're not as smart as I thought for a moment.\" ''But, Mr. Wynand, what ... T' \"Didn't you realize that this statue would be the surest way to kill any possible appetite I might have for your Mrs. KeatingT' ''You haven~t seen her, Mr. Wynand.\" \"Oh, she's probably beautiful, She might be more beautiful than this.

And now I think you should wish me a good night and get out of here.\" \"Yes; Mr. Wynand I wish you a good night.\" Wynand accompanied him to the hall. At the door Wynand said; 1 . \"You're a poor businessman, Toohey. I don't know why you're so anxious to have me meet Mrs. Keating. I don't know-what your racket is in trying to get a commission ·for that Keating of yourS.

I shall wear it next time,\" said Dominique. \"It was a nice party. Did you have a good time?\" \"I always have a good time.\" . \"So did I ... Only ... Oh God, do you. want to know the truth?\" \"No.\" \"Dominique, I was bored to death. Vincent Knowlton is a pain in the neck. He's such a damn snob.

A fire crackled in the fireplace of his living room. He had turned out all the lights, save one lamp with a yellow silk shade; but it created no air of intimate relaxation, it only made the place look deserted, like a vacant apartment with the utilities shut off.

Once at a large party an elegant drunk had asked bim, with a wink declar- ing unmistakable intentions: \"Say, do you know that gorgeous creature over there?\" \"Slightly,\" Keating had answered, gratified, \"she's my wife.\" He often told himself gratefully that their marriage had turned out much better than he had expected. Dominique had become an ideal wife. She devoted herself completely to his interests: pleas- ing his clients, entertaining his friends, running his home. She changed nothing in his existence: not his hours, not his favorite menus, not even the arrangement of hil! furniture. She . had brought nothing with her, except her clothes; she had not added a single book or ash tray to his house. When he expressed his views on any subject, she did not ~ agreed with him. Graciously, as a matter of natural course, she took second- place, vanishing in his background. He had expected a torrent that would lift him and smash him against some unknown rocks. He had not _found even a brook joining his peaceful river. It was more as if the river went on and someone- came to swim .quietly in his wake; no, not even to swim-that was a cutting, forceful action-but just to float be- hind him with the current. Had he been offered the power to de- termine Dominique's attitude after their marriage, he would .have asked that she behave exactly as she did. Only their nights left him miserably unsatisfied. She submitted whenever he wanted her. But it was always as on their first night: an indifferent body in his -arms, without revulsion, without an- swer. As far as he was concerned, she was still a virgin: he had never made her experience anything. Each time, burning with hu- miliation, he decided never to touch her again. But his desire re- turned, aroused by the constant presence .of her beauty. He sUrrendered to it, when he could resist no longer; not often. It was his mother who stated the thing he had not admitted to himself about his marriage.\"' can't stand it,\" his mother said, six months after the wedding. ''If she'd just get angry at me once, call me names, throw things at me. it would be all right. But I can't stand this.'' \"What, Mother?\" he asked, feeling a cold hint of panic. ''It's no use, Peter,\" she answered. His mother, whose arguments, opinions, reproaches he had never been able to stop, would not say another word about his marriage. She took a small apartment of her_ own and moved out of his house. She came to visit him often and she was always polite to Dominique, with a strange, beaten air of resignation.

Many stole Cameron's forms; few understood his think- ing. The sole part of his argument irresistible to the owners of new structures was fmandal economy; he won to that extent. In the- countries of Europe, most prominently in Germany, a . new school of building had been growing for a long· time: it con- sisted of putting up four walls and a flat top over them, with a few openings.

She found that she wanted them to be hers. \"Gail, I haven't asked you what we are to do now. Are we go- ing away? Are we having a honeymoon? Funny, I haven't even wondered about it.

For two weeks after their wedding they never left the pent- house. She could have pres~ the button of the elevator and bro- ken these weeks any tinie she wished; she did ri9t wish it. She had no desire to resist, to wonder, to question. It was enchant- ment and peace. · He sat talking to her for hours when ~e wanted. He was con- tent to sit silently, .when she preferred, and look at her as he looked at the objects in his art gallery, with the same distant, on- disturbing glance. He answered any question she put to him. He never asked questions. He never spoke of what he felt.-When she wished to be alone, he did not call for her. One evening she sat reading in her room and saw him standing at the frozen parapet of the dark roof garden outside, not looking back at the house, only standing in the streak of light from her window. When the two weeks ended, he ·went back to his work, to the office of the Banner. But the sense of isolation remained, rnre a . 486"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"theme declared and to be preserved through all their futul'e days. He came home in the evening and the city ceased to exist. He had no desire to go anywhere. -He invited no guests.

But he maintained a wall she could not break-the wall he had erected betWeen his wife and his newspapers. Her name never a~ in their pages.

He did not hesitate to open her mail-if it bore an official letterhead that betrayed- its. purpo~ destroy it without answer and to tell her that he had destroyed it. She shrugged and said nothing. Yet he did not seem to share her contempt for his papers. He did not allow her to discuss them.. She could not discover what he thought of them, nor what he felt. Once, when she commented on an offensive editorial, he said coldly: - _ \"I've never apologized for the Banner. I never will.\" \"But this is really awful, Gail.\" ''I thought you married me as the publisher of the Banner.\" ''I thought you didn't like to think of that.\" ''What I like or dislike doesn't concern you. Don't expect me to change the Banner or sacrifice it. I wouldn't ~ that for any- . one on -earth.\" · ,- _ . - She laughed. ''I wouldn't ask it, Gail.\" He did not laugh in answer. · In his office in the Banner Building, he worked with a new en- ergy, a kind of elated, ferocious drive that surprised the men who had known him in his most ambitious years. He stayed in the of- fice all night when necessary, as he had not done for a long time. Nothing changed in his methods and policy. Alvah Scarret watched him with satisfaction. \"We were wrong about him, Ellsworth,\" said Scarret to his constant companion, \"it's the same old Gail, God bless him. Better than ever.\" ''My dear Alvah,\" said Toohey, ''nothing is ever as simple as you think-nor as fast.\" \"But he's happy.

Sally Brent was one of the proudest possessions of the Banner, a stout, middle-aged woman who dressed like a model for a style show of the twenty- first~ntury and WI:Ote like a chambermaid. She had a large per- sonal following among the readers of the Banner. Her popularity made her overconfident. . Sally Brent decided to do a story on Mrs. Gail Wynand. It was just her type of story and there it was, simply going to waste. She gained admittance to Wynand's penthouse, using the tactics of gaining admittance to places where one is not wanted which she had been taught as a well-trained Wynand employee. She made her· usual dramatic entrance, wearing a black dress with a fresh suntlower on.her11howder-her constant ornament that had be- come a personal trade-mark~d she said to Dominique breath- leilsly: \"Mrs. Wynand, rve come here to help you deceive your husband!\" Then she winked at her own naughtiness and explained: \"Our dear Mr. Wynand has been unfair to you, my dear, depriving you of yom rightM fame, for some reason which I just simply can't understand.

Dominique gave her the story. She gave the exact kind of story Sally had dreamed ·about. · \"Yes, of course I cook his breakfast,\" said Dominique. \"Ham and eggs-is his favorite dish, just plaih ham and eggs ...

It hit her cheek anq fell_to the floor. Site picked it up, unrolled it, saw what it was and laughed aloud. · Sally Brent wrote an article on Gail Wynand's.Iove life~ In a gay, intellectual manner, in the terms of sociologicai study, the article presented material such as no pulp magazine would have accepted. It was published in the New Frontiers. Wynand bought Dominique a necklace designed at his special o~der. It w~ ma~e of ~amonds wi~out viSible settings, space~ Wide apart m an Irregular pattern, bke a handful scattered acCI- dentally, held together by platinum chains made under a micro- scope, barely noticeable. When he clasped it about her neck, it looked like drops of water fallen at rapdom. .. She stood before a mirror~ She slipped her dressing gown off her shoulders and let the raindrops glitter on her skiil. She said: \"That life story of the Bronx housewife who mur-dered ·her husband's young mistress is pretty sordid, . Gail. · But I think there's something dirtier-the cliiiosity 9f the people who like to read about it And then there's something dirtier still--:.the people who pander to that curiosity. Actually, it was that housewife- she has piano legs and such a baggy neck in her pictures-who made this necklace possible. It's a beautiful necklace. I shall be proud to wear it.\" He smiled; the sudden brightJiess of his eyes had an odd qual- ity of courage. \"That's one way of looking at it,\" he said. \"There's another. I like to think that I took the worst refuse of the human spirit-the , mind of that housewife and the minds of the people who like to · read about her-and I made of it this necklace on your shoulders. I like to thiiik that I was an alchemist capable of performing so great a purification.\" . She saw no apology, no regret, no resentment as he looked at her.

Ellsworth Toohey had mentioned regretfully in his column that the title of the play bad had to be changed slightly-\"as a con- cession to the stuffy prudery of the middle class which still con- trols our theater. It is a crying example of interference with the freedom of the artist. Now don't let's hear any. more of that old twaddle about ours being a free society. Originally, the title of this beautiful play was an authentic line drawn from the language of the people, with the bmve, simple eloquence of folie expres- sion.\" Wynand and Dominique_ sat in the.center of the fourth row, not looking at each other, listening to the play. The things being done on the stage were merely trite and crass; but the undercUrrent made them frightening. 'n!ere was an air ·about the ponderous inanities spoken, which the actors had absorbed like an infection; it was in· their smirking faces, in the slyness of their voices; in their untidy gestures. It was an air of inanities uttered WI rev.ela- . tions and insolently demanding acceptance as such; an air, not of innocent presumption, but of consc10us. effrontery; as if the au- thor knew the nature of his work .and boasted of his power to make it appear· sublime in the minds of his audience and thus de- stroy the capacity for .the sublime within them. The work justi- fied the verdict of its .sponsors: it brought laughs, it was amusing; it was an indecent joke, acted out not on the stage but in the au- dience. It wa8 a pedestal from which a god had been tom, and in his place there stoQd, not Satan with a .sword, but a comer lout sipping a bottle of Coca-Cola. · There was silence in the audience, puzzled and bumble. When someone laughed, the rest joined in, with relief, glad to learn that they were enjoying themselves. Jules Fougler had .not tried to in- fluence anybody; be had merely made clear-well in advance and through many channels-that anyone unable to enjoy this plliy was, basically, a worthless human being. \"It's no use asking for explanations,\" be had said. ''Either you're fine enough to like it or you aren't.\" · . In the intermission Wynand heard a stout woman saying: \"It's wonderful. I don't understand it, but I have the feeli~g that it's something very important.\" Dominique asked him: \"Do you wish to go, \"Gail?'' He said: ''No. We'll stay to the end.\" . He was silent in the car on their way home. When they entered their drawing room, he stood waiting, ready to hear and accept anything.

She looked at Wynand stretched in a deck chair before her. She thought of the change she noticed in him again aboard ship. She had watched him through the months of their summer cruise. She had seen him once running down a companionway; the picture remained in her mind; a tall white figure thrown for- ward in a streak of speed and confidence; his hand grasped a rail- ing, risking deliberately the danger of a sudden break, gaining a new propulsion. He was not the corrupt publis~ of a popular empire. He was an aristocrat aboard a yach~. He looked, she thought, like what one believes aristocracy to be when: one is young: a brilliant kind of gaiety without guilt. She looked at him in· the deck chair. She thought that relaxa- tion. was a~tive only in those for whom it was an unnatural state; then even limpness acquired purpose. She wondered about him; Gail Wynand, famous for his extraordinary capacity; but this was. not merely the force of an ambitious adventurer who had created a chain of newspapers; this-the quality she saw in him here-the thing stretched out under the sun like an aQSwer- this was greater, a first cause, a faculty out of universal dynam- ics. ''Gail,\" she said suddenly, involuntarily. He opened his eyes to look at her. \"I wish I had \"taken a recording of that,\" he said lazily. \"You'd be startled to hear what it sounded like. Quite wasted here. I'd like to play it back in a bedroom.\" \"I'll repeat it there, if you wish.\" \"Thank you~ dearest. And I promise not· to exaggerate or pre- sume too much.

So he felt anger that he should find exultation only in the wilderness, that this great sense of hope had to be lost when he would return to men and men's work. He thought that this was not right; that man's work should be a higher step, an improve- ment on nature, not a degradation. He did not want to despise men; he wanted to love and admire them. But he dreaded the sight of the first house, poolroom and movie poster he would en- counter on his way. - He had always wanted to write music, and·he could give no other identity to the thing he sought. If you want to know what it is, he told himself, listen to the first phrases of Tchaikovsky's First Concerto-Qr the last movement of Rachmaninoff's Second. Men have not found the words for it nor the deed nor the thought, but they have found the music. Let me see that in one single act of man on earth. Let me see it made real.

It would be funny, he thought, if I came to the edge and found nothing but that blue be- yond; nothing but the sky ahead, above and below. He closed his eyes and went on, suspending the possible for a moment, grant- ing himself a dream, a few instants of believing that he would reach the crest, open his eyes and see the blue radiance of the sky below. His foot touched the ground, breaking his motion; he stopped and opened his ·eyes. He stood still. In the broad valley, far below him, in the first sunlight of early morning, he saw a town. Only it was not a town. Towns did not look like that. He had to suspend the possible for a while longer, to seek no questions or explanations, only to look. There were small houses on the ledges of the hill before hill\\, flowing down to the bottom. He knew that the ledges had not been touched, that no artifice had altered the unplanned beauty of the graded steps. Yet some power had known how. to build on these ledges in such a way that the houses became ·inevitable, and one could no longer imagine the hills as beautiful without them-as if the centuries and the series of chances that produced · these ledges in the struggle of great blind forces had waited for their final expression, had been only a road to a goal-and the 504"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"goal was these buildings. part of the hi~. shaped by the hills,.yet ruling them by giving them meaning. The houges were plain field stone-like the rocks jutting from the green hillsides-and of glass, great sheets of glass used as if \"the sun were invited to complete the structures, sunlight becom- ing part of the masonry.

But they were like variations of a single theme, like a symphony played by an inexhaustible imagination, and .one could still hear the laughter of the force that had been let loose on them, as if that force had run, unrestrained; challenging itself to be spent, but had never reached its end. Music, he thought, the promise of the music he had invoked, the sense of it made real- there it was before his eyes-he did not see it-he heard it in chords-he thought that there was a common language of thought, sight and sound-was it mathematics?-the discipline of reason-music was mathematics-and architecture was. musie in stone-he knew he was dizzy because this place below him could not be real. He. saw trees, lawns, walks twisting up the hillsides, steps cut in the stone, he saw fountains, swimming pools, tennis courts- and not a sign of life. The place was uninhabited. It did not shock him, not as the sight of it had shocked him. In a way, it seemed proper; this was not part of known existence. For the moment he had no desire to know what it was. After a long time he glanced about him-and then he saw that he . was not alone. Some steps away from him a man sat on a boulder, looking down at .the valley. The man seemed absorbed in the sight and had not heard his approach. The man was tall and gaunt imd had orange hair. He walked straight to the man, who turned his eyes to him; the eyes were gray and calm; the boy knew suddenly that they felt the same thing, and he could speak as he would not speak to a stranger anywhere else. ''That isn't real, is it?'' the boy asked, pointing down. \"Why, yes, it is, now,\" the man answered. ''It's not a movie set or a trick of some kind?\" \"No. It's a summer resort. It's just been completed. It will be opened in a few weeks.\" ''Who built it?\" \"I did.\" \"What's your name?\" \"Howard Roark.\" ''Thank you,\" said the boy. He knew that the steady eyes look- ing at him understood everything these two words had to cover. Howard Roark inclined his head, in acknowledgment.

He bad never seen that boy before and be. woula never see him again. He did iwt- know that he had given someone the courage to face a lifetime. Roark had never understood why .be was chosen to build the· summer resort at Monadnock Valley. . It had happened a year and a .half ago, in the fall of 1933. He had heard of the project aiJ.d gone to see.Mr. Caleb Bradley, the head of some vast company that had pun:hased the valley and was doing a great 4ea1 of loud promotion. He went to see Bradley as a matter of duty, without hope. merely to add another refusal to his long list of refusals. He had built nothing in New York since the Stoddard Temple. . When he entered Bradley's office, he knew that he must forget Monadnock Valley because this man would neve~ give it to him. Caleb Bradley was a short, pudgy person with a handsome face between rounded sholilders; The face looked wise and boyish, unpleasantly ageless; he could have been fifty or tWenty; he had blank blue eyes, sly and bored. But it was difficult for Roark to forget Monadnock Valley. So he spoke of it, forgetting that speech was useless here. Mr. Bradley listened, obviously interested, but obviously not in what Roark was saying.- Roark could almost feel some third entity present.in the room. Mr.: Bradley said little, beyond promising to consider it . and to get in -touch with him. But then he said a strange thing. He -asked, in a voice devoid of all- clue to. the pur- pose of the question, neither in approval nor scorn: \"You're the architect who built the Stoddard Temple, aren'~yoli, Mr. Roark?'' \"Yes,\" said Roark. \"Fuuny that I hadn't thought of you myself,\" said Mr. Bradley. Roark went away, thinking that it would have been fuuny if Mr. Bradley had thought of biin. Three days later, Bradley telephoned and invited him to his of- fice. Roark came and met four other men-the Board of the Mo- nadnock Valley Company. They were well-dressed men, and their f~s were as closed as Mr. Bradley's. ''Please tell these gentle- men what you told me, Mr. Roark,\" Bradley said pleasantly. · Roark explained .his plan. If what they wished to build was an unusual summer resort for people of moderate incomes-as they . had announced-then they should re8Iize that the worst curse of poverty was the lack of privacy; only the very rich or the very · poor of the city could enjoy their suinmer vacations; the very rich, because they had private estates; the- very poor; because they did not mind the feel and· smell of one another's flesh on public beaches and public dance floors; the people of good taste and small income had no place to go, if they found no rest or pleasure in herds.

Not. one stock-farm corral of tennis courts for exhibitionists-but many private tennis courts. Not a place where one went to meet \"refmed company\" and land a husband in two weeks-but a resort for people who enjoyed their own presence well enough and sought only a place where they ·would be left free to enjoy it. · The men listened to him silently. He saw them exchangi!lg glances once in a while. He felt certain that they were the kind of glances people exchange when they cannot laugh at the s~er aloud. But it could not have been that-because he signed a contract to build the Monadnock Valley summe.: resort, two days later. . · He demanded Mr. Bradley's initials on every drawing that came out of his drafting rooms; he remembered the Stoddard Temple. Mr. Bradley initialed, signed, okayed; he agreed to ev- erything; he approved everything. He seemed delighted to _let Roark have his way. But this eager complaisance had· a peculiar undertone-as if Mr. Bradley were humoring a child. . He could learn little !!bout Mr. Bradley. It was· said that the man had made a fortune in real estate,_ in the Florida boom. HiS ~present company seemed ·to command unlimited funds, and the names of many wealthy backers were mentioned as shareholders. · Roark never met\" them. The four gentlemen of the Board did not appear again, except on short visits to the construction site, where they exhibited little interest. Mr. Bradley was in full charge of everything-but beyond a close watch over the budget he seemed to like nothing better than to leave Roark in full charge. In the eighteen months that followed, Roark had no time to .. wonder about Mr. Bradley. Roark was building his greatest as- signment. For the last year he lived at the construction site, in a shanty hastily thrown together on a bare hillside, a wooden enclosure with a bed, a stove and a laqe table. His old draftsmen came to work for him again, some abandoning better jobs in the city, tO live in shacks and tents, to work in naked plank barracks that served as architect's office. There was so much to build that none · of them thought of wasting structural effort on their own shelters.

This was a new .earth, their own. The hills rose to the sky around them, as a wall of protection. And they had another protection- the architect who walked among them, down ·the snow or the grass of the hillsides, over the boulders and the piled planks, to the drafting tables, to the derricks, to the tops of rising walls- the man who had made this possible-the thought in the mj.nd of that man-and not the content of that thought, nor the result, not the vision that had ~ted Monadnock Valley, nor the will that had made it ~-but the method. of his thought, the rule of its function-the method and rule which were not like those of the world beyond the hills. That stood on guard over the valley and over the crusaders within it. And then he saw Mr. Bradley come to visit the site, to smile· blandly and depart again.

But I can't figure out in just what way or what they're after.\" He rolled over on his stomach and looked down at the panes of glass scattered through the darkness below; they caught reflec- tions from somewhere and looked like phosphorescent, self- generated springs of light rising out of the ground. He said: \"It doesn't matter, Steve, does it? Not wllat they do about it nor who comes to live here. Only that we've made it. Would you have missed this, no matter what price they make you pay for it afterward?\" \"No,\" said Mallory. Roark had wanted to rent one of the houses for himself and spend the summer there, the first summer of Monadnock Valley's existence. But before the ·resort was open, he received a wire from New York. \"I told you I would, didn't I? It took five years to get rid of my friends and brothers, but the Aquitania is now mine-and yours .. Come to finish it. Kent Lansing.'~ So be went back to New York-to see the rubble and cement dust cleared away from the hulk of the Ul)finished Symphony, to see derricks swing girders high over Central Park, to see the gaps of windows filled, the broad decks spread over the roofs of the city, the· Aquitania Hotel completed, glowing at night in the Park's skyline. He had been very busy in the last two years. Monadnock Val- ley bad not been his only. commission. From different states, from unexpected parts of the country, calls had come for him: private homes, small office buildings, modest shops. He had built them-snatching a few hours of sleep on trains and planes that carried him from Monadnock Valley to distant small towns. The story of every commission he received was the same: \"I was in New York and I liked the Enright House.'' \"I saw the Cord Building.\" \"I saw a picture of that temple they tore down.'' It was as if an underground stream flowed through the country and broke out in sudden springs that shot to the surface at random, in unpredictable places. They were small, inexpensive jobs-but he was kept working. That summer, with Monadnock Valley completed, he had no time to worry about its future fate. But Steven Mallory worried about it. ''Why don't they advertise it, Howard? Why the sudden silence? Have you noticed? There was so much talk about their grand project, so many little items in print-before they started. There was. less and less while we were doing it. And now? Mr. Bradley and company.have gone deaf-mute. Now, when you'd expect them to stage a press agent's orgy. Why?\" 509"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"\"I wouldn't know,\" said Roark. \"I'm an architect, not a rental agent. Why should you worry? We've done our job, let them do theirs in their own way.\" · . \"It's a damn queer way. Did you see their ads-the few they've let dribble out? They say all the things you told them, about rest; peace and privacy-but hQw they say it! Do you know what those ads amount to in effect? 'Come to Monadnock Valley and be bored to death.' It sounds-it actually sounds as if they were trying to keep people away.'' \"I don't read ads, Steve.'' But-within a month of its opening every house in Monadnock Valley was rented. The people who came were a strange mixture: socjety men and women who could have afforded more fashion- able resorts, young writers· and unknown artists, engineers and newspapermen and factory workers. Suddenly,· spontaneously, people were talking about Monadnock Valley. There was a need for that kind of~a resort, a need no one had tried to satisfy. The place became news, but it was private news; the papers had not discovered it. Mr. Bradley had no press agents; Mr. Bradley and his company had vanished from public life. One magazine, unso- licited, printed four pages. of photographs of Monadnock Valley, and sent a ritari to interview Howard Roark. By the end of sum- mer the houses were leased in ·advance for the follpwing year. In OCtober, early one morning, the door of Roark's reception room flew open and Steven Mallory nished in, making straight for Roark's office. The secretary tried to stop him; Roark was working and no interruptio11s were allowed. But Mallory shoved her aside and tore into the office, slamming the door behind. She noticed that he held a newspaper in his hand. Roark glanced up at him, from the drafting table, and dropped his pencil. He knew that this· was the way Mallory's face had looked when he shot at Ellsworth Toohey. ''Well, Howard? Do you want to know why you got Monad- nock Valley?\" He threw the newspaper down on the ·table. Roark saw the heading of a story on the third page: \"Caleb Bradley arrested.\" \"It's all there,\" said Mallory. \"Don't read it. It will make you sick.\" · \"All right, Steve, what is it?\" ''They sold two hundred percent of it.\" ''Who did? Of what?\" \"Bradley and his gang. Of Monadnock Valley.\" Mallory spoke with a forced, viciOIJS, self-torturing precision. ''They thought it was worthless-from the first. They got the land practically for. nothing-they thought it was no place for a resort at all-out of the way, with no bus lines or movie theaters around-they thought the time wasn't right and the public wouldn't go for it. They made a lot of noise and sold shares to a lot of wealthy 510"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"suckers-it was just a huge fraud. They sold two hundred percent of the place. They got twice what it cost them to build it. They were certain it would fail. They wanted it to fail. They expected no profits to distribute. They had a nice scheme ready for how to get out of it when the place went bankrupt. They were prepared for anything-except for seeing it tum into the kind of success it is. And they couldn't go on-because now they'd have to pay their backers twice the amount the place earned each year. And it's earning plenty. And they thought they had arranged for cer- tain failure. Howard, don't you understand? They chose you as the worst architect they could find!\" 'Roark threw his head back and laughed. \"God damn you, Howard! It's not funny!\" \"Sit down, Steve. Stop shaking. You look as if you'd just seen a whole field of butchered bodies.\" \"I have. I've seen worse. I've seen the root. I've seen what makes such fields possibie. What do the damn fools think of as horror? Wars, murders, fires, earthquakes? To hell with that! This is horror-that story in the paper. That's what men should dread and fight and scream about and call the worst shame on their rec- ord. Howard, I'm thinking of all the explanations of evil and all the remedies offered for it through the centuries. None of them worked, None of them explained or cured anything. But the root of evil-my drooling beast-it's there. Howard, in that story. In that-and in the souls of the smug bastards who'll read it and say: 'Oh well, genius must always struggle, it's good,for 'em'- and then go and look for some village idiot to 'help, to teach him how to weave baskets. That's the drooling beast in action. How- ard, think of Monadnock. Close your eyes and see it And then think.that the men who ordered it, believed it was the worst thing they could build! Howard, there's something wrong, something very terribly wrong in the world if you were given your greatest job-as a filthy joke!\" \"When will you stop thinking about that? About the world and me? When will you learn to forget it? When will Dominique .... \" He stopped. They had not mentioned that name in each other's presence for five y_ears. He saw Mallory's eyes, intent and shocked. Mallory realized that his words had hurt Roark, hurt him enough to force this admission. But Roark turned to him and said deliberately: \"Dominique used to think just as you do.\" . Mallory had never spoken of what he guessed about Roark's past. Their silence had always implied that Mallory understood, that Roark knew it, and that it was not to be discussed. But now Mallory asked: \"Are you still waiting for her to come back? Mrs. Gail Wynand-God damn her!\" Roark said without emphasis: 511"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"\"Shut up,· Steve.\" Mallory-whispered: ''I'm sony.\" _ Roark walked to his· table and said, his voice nonnal again: · \"Go home, Steve, and forget about Bradley. They'll all be su- ing one another now, but we won't be dragged in and they won't destroy Monadnock. Forget it, and get out, I have to work.\" He brushed the· newspaper off the table, with his elbow, and bent over the sheets of drafting paper. · There was a scandal• over· the revelations of the financing methods behind Monadnock Valley, there was .a triid, a few gen- tlemen sentenced to the penitentiary, imd a new management tak- ing Monadnock over for the shareholders. Roark was not involved. He was busy, and he forgot to read the accounts of the trial in the papers. Mr. Bradley admitted-in apology to his partners-that he would be damned if he could have expected a resort built on a crazy, unsociable plan ever to become success- ful. \"I did all I could--1 chose the worst fool I could find.'' Then Austen Heller Wrote an article about Howard Roark and Monadnoek Valley. He spoke of all the buildings Roark had de- signed, and he put-into words the things Roark had said in struc- ture. Only they· were not Austen Heller's usual quiet w0rds-4hey were .a ferocious cry of admiration and of anger. \"And may we be damned if greatness mustteach us through fraud!\" The. article started a Violent controversy in art circles. \"Howard;\"· Mallory said one ·day; sO'me months later, \"you're famous.\"· · ·· \"Yes,\" said Roark; \"I suppose so.\" ''Three-quarters of them don't know what it's all about, but thefve heard the other one-quarter fighting over your name and so now they feel they must pronounce it with:_re8pect. Of the fighting quarter, four:tenths are tho~ who hate. you, three-tenths are those who feel they must express an opinion in any contro- versy, two-tenths are those-who play safe and herald any 'discov- ery,' and one-tenth are those who understand. But they've all found out suddenly- that fl.lere is a Howard Roark and that h~'s an architect. The A.G.A. Bulletin refers to you as a great but unruly talent-and the Museum of the Future has hung up photographs of Monadnock, the Enright House, the Cord Building and the Aquitania, under beautiful glass-next to the room where they've got Gordon L. Prescott. Alld still-I'm glad.\" · Kent Lansing said, one evening: \"Heller did a grand job. Do you remember, Howard, what I told you once about the psychol- ogy of a pretzel?

It takes two to make a very great ca- reer: the man who is great, and the man-almost rarer-who is great enough to.see greatness and say so.\" _ · Ellsworth Toohey wrote: \"The paradox in all this preposterous 512"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"noise is the fact that Mr. Caleb Bradley is the victim of a ~ve injustice. His ethics are open to- censure; -~ut his esthetics were unimpeachable. He exhibited sounder judgment in matters of ar- chitectural merit than Mr. Austen Heller, the outmoded reaction- ary who has suddenly turned art critic. Mr. Caleb Bradley was martyred by the bad taste of his tenants. In the opinion of this column his sentence should have been commuted in recognition of his artistic discrimination. Monadnock Valley is a fraud-but not merely a financial one.\" There was little response to Roark's fame among the solid gen- tlemen of wealth who were the steadiest source of architectural commissions. The men who. had said: ''Roark? Never heard of him,'' now said: ''Roark'! He's too sensational.~' But there were men who were impressed by the simple fact that Roark had built a place which made money for owners who didn't want to make money; this was more convincing than ab- stract artistic discussions. And there was the one-tenth who un- derstood. In the year after Monadnock Valley Roark built tWo private homes in Connecticut, a movie theater in Chicago, a hotel in Philadelphia. -- ~ In the spring 1:>f 1936 .a western city completed plans for a World's Fair to be held next year, an international exposition to be known as '\"The March of the Centuries.\" The committee of distinguished civic leaders in charge of the project chose a coun- cil of the_ country's best architects to design the fair. The civic leaders wished to be conspicuously progressive. Howard Roark was one of the eight architects chosen. . When he received the invitation, Roark appeared before the committee and explained that he would be glad to- design the fair.....:....aJ.one. \"But you can't be serious, Mr. Roark,\" the chairnuln declared. \"After all, with a stupendous uncJertaking of this nature, we want the best that can be had.l mean, two heads are better than ~ne, you know, and eight heads ... why, you can see for yourself- the best talents of the country, the brightest names-you know, friendly consultation, co-operation and collaboration-you know what makes great achievements.\" - \"I do.\" '\"Then you realize ... \" \"If you want me, you'll have to let me do it all, alone. r don't work with councils.\" \"You wish to reject an opportunity like this, a shot in history, a chance of world fame, practically a chance of immortality ... \" \"I don't work with collectives. I don't consult, I don't co- operate, I don't collaborate.\" There. was ~ great deal of angry comment on Roark's refusal, in architectural circles. People said: '\"The .conceited bastard!\" The indignation was too sharp and raw for a mere piece of profes- 513"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"sionlll gossip; each man took ·it as a persolllil insult; each felt hiiilself. qualified to alter, advise and improve the work of any man living. · \"The incident illustrates· to perfection,\" wrote Ellsworth Toohey, •'the antisocial nature of Mr. Howard Roark's egotism, the arrogance of the unbridled individualism which he has always personified.\" Among the eight chosen· to design \"The March of the Centu- ries\" were Peter Keating, Gordon L. Prescott, Ralston Holcombe. \"I won't work with Howard Roark,\" said· Peter Keating, when he saw the list of the council, \"you'll have to choose. It's he or 1.\" He wa8 informed that Mr. Roark had declined. Keating assumed leadership over the council. The press stories about the progress of the fair's construction referred to \"Peter Keating and his asso- ciates.\"· Keating had acquired a sharp, intractable manner in the ·last few years. He snapped orders and lost his patience before ·the smallest difficulty; when he lost his patience, he screamed at peo- ple: he had a vocabulary of insults that carried a caustic, insidi- ous, almost feminine malice; his. face was sullen. In the fall of 1936 Roark moved his office to the top floor of the Cord Building. He had thought when he designed that build- ing, that it would be the place of his office some day. When he saw the inscription: \"Howard Roarlc, Architect,\" on his new door, he stopped for a moment; then he walked into the office. His owli room, . at the end of a long suite, had three walls of glass, ·· high over the city. He stopped in the middle of the room. Through the broad panes, he could see the Fargo Store, the Enright House, the Aquitania Hotel. He walked to the windows facing south and stood there for a long time. At the tip of Man- hattan, far in the distance, he could see the Dana Building by Henry Cameron. . On an afternoon. of November, returning to .his office after a visit to the site· of a house under construction on Long Island, Roark entered the reception room, shaking his-drenched raincoat, and saw a look of suppressed ·excitement on the face of his sec- retary; She had been waiting impatiently for his return. . \"Mr. Roark, this is probably something very big,\" she said. \"I made an appointment for you for three o'clock tomorrow after- noon. At his office.\" · \"Whose office?\" \"He telephoned half an hour ago. Mr. Gail Wynand.\" 514"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"2 A siGN hung over the entrance door, a reproduction of the paper's masthead: THE NEW YORK BANNER The sign was small, a ·statement of fame and power. that needed no emphasis; it was like a fine, mocking smile that justi- fied the building's bare ugliness; the building was a factory scQmful of all ornament save the implications of that masthead. The entrance lobby looked ~e the mouth of a furnace; eleva- . tors drew a stream of human fuel and spat it out The men did not hurry, but they moved with subdued haste, the propulsion of purpose; nobody loitered in that lobby. The elevator doors clicked like valves, a pulsating rhythm in their sound. Drops of red and green light flashed on ~ wall board, signaling the prog- ress of cars high in space. It looked as if everything in that building were run by . such control boards in the hands of an authority aware of every mo- tion, as if the building were flowing With channeled energy, func- tioning smoothly, soundlessly, a magnificent machine that nothing. could destroy. Nobody paid any attention to the red- . headed man who stopped in the lobby for a moment · Howard. Roark looked up at the tiled vault He had never hated anyone. Somewhere in this building was its owner, the man who had made him feel his nearest approach to hatred. Gail Wynand glanced at the small clock on his desk. In a few minutes he had an ~intment with an architect The interview, he thought,- would not be difficult; he had held many such ~ter­ views in his life; he merely had. to speak, he knew what he wanted to say, and nothing was required of the architect except a few sounds signifying tinderstanding. . His glance went from the clock back to the sheets of proofs on his desk. He read an editorial by Alvah Scarret on the. public feeding of squirrels in Central Park, and a column by Ellsworth Toohey on the great merits of an exhibition of paintings done by the workers of the City Department of Sanitation. A buzzer rang . on his desk, and his secretary's voice said: ''Mr. Howard Roark, ·Mr. Wynand.\" ''Okay,\" said Wynand, flicking the switch off. As his hand moved back, he noticed the row of buttons at the edge of his desk, bright little knobs with a color code of their own, each rep- resenting the· end of a wire that stretched to some part of the building, each wire controlling some man, each man controlling 515"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"many men under his orders, each group of men contributing to the final shape of words on paper to go into millions of homes, into millions of human brains-these little knobs of colored plas- tic, there under his fingers.

Wynand was not certain that he missed a moment, that he did not rise at once as co~y demanded, but remained seated, look- ing at the man who entered; perhaps he bad risen immediately and it only seemed to him that a long time preceded his move- ment.

He said it simply, without insolence; as if nothing but total honesty were possible to him here.

When Roark had goli.e, Wynand sat behind his desk, smiling. He moved his hand toward one of the plastic buttons---and stopped. He realized that he had to assume a different manner, his usual inanner, that he could not speak as he had spoken in the last half-hour. Then he understood what had been strange about the interview: for the ftrst time in his life he had spoken to a man without feeling the reluctance, the sense of pressure, the need of disguise he had always experienced when he spoke to people; there .. had been no strain and no need of strain; as if he had spo- ken to himself. He pressed the ·button and said to his secretary: . ''Tell the morgue to send me everything they have on Howard Roark.\" \"Guess what,\" said Alvah Scarret, his voice begging to be begged for his information .. Ellsworth Toohey waved a hand impatiently in a brushing-off motion, not raising his eyes from ·his desk. \"Go 'way, Alvah. I'm busy.\" ''No, but this is interesting, Ellsworth.

Scarret had. not noticed the change, it was too late to resent it-it had become normal to them both. . · Scarret smiled like a bright pupil who expects the teacher ·to praise him for discovering an error in the teacher's own textbook. \"Ellsworth, your private F.B.I. is slipping.\" \"What are you talking about?\" · \"Bet you don't know· what Gail's been doing-and you always, make such a point of keeping yourself informed.\" \"What don't I know?\" \"Guess who was in his office today.\" \"My dear Alvah, I have no time f9r quiz games.\" \"You wouldn't guess in a thousand years.\" \"Very well, since the only way to get rid of you is to play the vaudeville stooge, I shall ask the proper question: Who was in dear ·Gail's office today?\" \"Howard Roark.\" Toohey turned to him full face, forgetting to dole out his atten- tion, and said incredulously: \"No!\" - \"Yes!\" said Scarret, proud of the effect. \"Well!\" said Toohey and burst out laughing. Scarret half smiled tentatively, puzzled, anxious to join in, but not quite certain of the cause for amusement. \"Yes, it's funny.

Roark had an apartment in the Enright House, one of the crystal-shaped units over the· East River: a workroom, a library, a bedroom. He had designed the furniture himself. Wynaild could not .understand for a long time why the place gave him an impression of .luxury, until he saw that one did not notice the furniture at all: only a clean sweep of space. and the luxury of an austerity that had not been simple to achieve. In financial value it was the most modest home that Wynand had entered as a guest in twenty-five years. · ''We started in. the same way, Howard,\" he said, glancing about Roark's J'09m. \"According to my judgment. and experience, you should have remained in the gutter.

What made you change your mind?\" ''I can't explain that to you,\" They drove together to the estate in Connecticut where the walls of the house were rising out of the frozen ground. Wynand followed Roark through the future rooms, he stood aside and 548"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"watched Roark giving instructions. Sometimes, Wynand came alone. The workers saw the black roadster twisting up the road to the top of the hill, saw Wynand's figure standing at a distance, looking at. the structure. His figure always carried with it all the implications of his position; the. quiet elegance of his- overcoat, the angle l.)f his hat, the confidence of his posture, tense and ca- sual together, made one think of the Wynand empire; of the presses thundering from ·ocean to ocean, of the papers, the lus- trous magazine covers, the light rays trembling through news- reels, the wires coiling over the world, the power flowing into every palace, every capital, every secret, CfllCial_ room, day. and night, through every costly minute of this man's life-. He stood. still against a sky gray as laundry water, and snowflakes fluttered lazily past the brim of his hat. . . .. On a day in ;April he drove alone to Connecticut after an ab- sence of many .weeks. The roadster flew across the countryside, not an object, but a long s~ of speed. He felt no jolting mo- tion inside his small cube of glass and leather; it seemed t9 him that his car stood still, suspended over the ground, w1tile the con- trol of his hands on the wheel made the earth fly past him, and he merely had to wait until the place he desired came rolling to him. He loved the wheel of a car as he loved his desk in the of- fice of the Banner: both gave him the same sense of a dangerous mon,ster let loose under the expert dir!:ction of his fingers. SQmething tore past across his vision; and he w~ a mile away before he thought how strange it was that he should have noticed it, because it had been only a clump of weeds by the road; a mile later he realized that it was stranger still: the weeds were green. Not in the middle of winter, ·he thought, and then be understood, surprised, that it· was not winter any longer. He hll!i been very busy in the last few weeks; be had not had time to. notice. Now he saw it, hanging over the fields around him. a hint of green, like a whisper. He heard three statements in his mind, in precise succession, like interlocking gears: It's spring-1 wonder if I have many left to see-I am ftfty-five years old .. They were statements, not emotions; he felt nothing, neither eagerness nor fear. But he knew it was strange that Jte should ex- perience a sense of time; he bad never thought of his ·age in re- lation to any measure, he had never deffued his position on a limited course, he had not thought of a course nor of limits; He had been Gail Wynand and he had stood still, like this car, and the years had sped past him, like this earth, and the motor within him had controlled the flight of the years. · . No, he thought, I regret nothing.

In his absence the house had taken shape; it could be recognized now-it looked like the drawing. lie felt a moment of childish wond~r that it had really come out just as on the Sketch, as if he had never quite believed it. Risiil.g against the pale blue sky, it still looked like a drawing, unfinished, the planes of masonry like spreads of watercolor filled--in, the naked scaf- folding like pencil lines; a huge drawing on a pale blue sheet of paper. . He left the car and walked to _the top ~f the hill. He saw Roark among the men. He stood outside and watched the way Roark walked through the structure, the way he turned his head. or raised his hand, pointing. H;e noticed Roark's manner of stop- ping: his legs apart, his aims straight at his sides, his head lifted; an instinctive p(>se of confidence, of energy held under effortless control a moment that gave to his body the structural cleanliness of his own building. Structure, thoughtWynand, is a solved prolr lem of tension, of balance, of security in counterthrusts. He thought: There's no emotional significance in the act of erecting a building; it's just a mechanical job, like laying sewers or making an automobile. And he wondered why he watched Roark, feeling what he felt in his art· gallery. He belongs in an unfinished building, thought Wynand, more than in a completed one, inore ·than at a drafting table, it's his right setting; it's be- coming to him-as Dominique said a yacht was becoming to me. Afterward.Roark came out and they walked together along the crest of the hill, among the trees. They sat down on a fallen tree trunk, they saw the structure in the distance through the stems of the brushwood. The stems were dry and ·naked, but there was a quality of spring in the.cheerful insolence of their upward thrust, the-stirring of a self-assertive pwpose. Wynand asked: · ''Howard, have you ever .been in love?'' Roark turned to look straight at him and answ~r quietly: \"I still am.\" \"But when you walk through a building, what you feel is greater than that?\" 550"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"\"Much greater, Gail.\" _ \"I was thinking of people who say that happiness is impossible on earth. Look how hard they all try to find some joy in life. Look how they struggle for it. Why should any living creature exist in pain? By what conceivable right can anyone demand that a human being exist for anything but his own joy? Every one of them wants it. Every part of him wants it. But they never find it. I wonder why. They whine and say they don't understand the meaning of life. There's a particular kind of people that I despise. Those· who seek some sort of a higher purpose or_ 'universal goal,' who don't know .what to live-for, who moan that they must 'fmd themselves.' You hear it all around us. That seems to be the official bromide of our century. Every book you open. Every drooling self:cconfession. It seems to be the noble thing to con-. fess. I'd think it would be the most shameful one.\" \"Look, Gail.\" Roark got up, reached out, tore a thick branch off a tree, held it in both hands, one fist closed at each end; then, his wrists and knuckles tensed against the resistance, he bent the branch slowly into an arc. \"Now· I can make vvhat I want of it: a bow, a,spear, a cane, a railing.

She watched them silently. She had .wapted to understand Wynand. This was the answer. She accepted Roark's visits to their house and the knowledge that in the hours of these evenings he was Wynand's property, not hers. She met him as a gracious hostess, indifferent and smil- ing, not a person but an exquisite fixture of Wynand's-home, she presided at the dinner table, she left them in the study afterward. She sat alone in the drawing room, with the lights turned off and the door open; she sat erect and quiet, her eyes on the slit.of light under the door of the study across the hall.. She . thought: This is my task, even when alone, even in· the darkness, within no knowledge but my own, to look at that door as I looked at him here, without complaint. ... Roark, if it's the punishment you chose for me, I'll carry it completely, not as a part to play in your p~esence, but as a duty to perform alone-you know that violence is not hard for me to bear, only patience is, y_ou chose 551"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"the hardest, and I must perform it and offer it to you ... my . .-. dearest one . . . , When Roark looked at her, there was no denial of memory in liis eyes.

Your . drawing room, your husband imd the city you dread beyond the windows, are they real now, Dominique? Dp you understand? ~ you beginning to understand? \"Yes,\" she. would &ay sud- denly, aloud, trusting that the word would fit the conversation· of the moment, knowing that Roark would hear it as his· answer. It was not a punishment he had chosen for her. It was a disci- pline imposed on both of them, the last test. She .understood his purpose when she found that she could feel her love for him proved J>y the. room, by Wynand, even by his love for Wynand and hers, by the impossible situation, by her enforced silence:- the barriers proving to. her that no barriers could exist. She did not see him alone. She waited. . She would not· visit the site of construction. She had said to Wynand: \"I'll see the house when it's finished.\" She never ques- tioned him about Roark. She. let her hands lie in sight on the anns of her chair, so that the relief of any violent motion would be denied her, her hands as her private barometer of enduran~. when Wynand came home late at night and told her that he had · spent the evening at Roark's apartment, the apartment she had never seen. Once she broke enough to ask: \"What is this, Gail? An obsessionT' ''I suppose so.\" He added: ''It's strange that you don't like e him.\" . . ''I haven't said that.\" . · · \"I can see it. I'm not really sUIJirised. It's your way. You would dislike him-precisely because he's the type of man you should. like ....

She sat looking at him as. she always did; her glance had tenderness without scorn and sadness without pity. . ''I understand, Gail.\" After a moment she asked: \"What is he to you, Gat1? In the ·nature of a shrine?\" ''In the nature of a hair shirt,'' said Wynand. . When she had gone upstairs, he walked to a window and stood 552"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"looking up at the sky.

Toohey, \"is the intellectual fallacy that freedom and compUlsion are opposites. To solve the gigantic problems crushing the world today, we must clarify OUl' mental confusion. We must acquire a philosophical perspective. In es&ence, freedom and compulsion are one. Let me give you a simple illustration. Traffic lights re- strain your .freedom to cross a street whel}.eVer you wish. But this restraint gives you the freedom from being run over by a truck: If you were assigned to a job and prohibited from leaVing it, it would restrain the freedom of your career. But it would give you freedom from the fear of unemployment Whenever a new com- pulsion is imposed upon us, we automatically gain .a new free- dom. The two are inseparable. Only by accepting total compulsion can we achieve total freedom.\" ''That's right!\" shrieked Mitchell Layton. It was an actual shriek, thin and high. It had come with the startling suddenness of .a fire siren. His guestS looked ~ Mitchell Layton. He sat in a tapestry armchair of his drawing room. half lying, .legs and stomach forward, like an obnoxious chiRl flaunting his bad· posture.

Something'had gone out of the firm and out of the circles from. which it drew its clients, with the retirement of Guy Francon. Keating realized that there had been art and skill and its own kind .of illogical energy in the career of Guy Francon, even if the art consisted only of his social charm and the energy was directed at snaring beWildered millionaires. There had· been a twisted sort of sense in people's response to Guy Frail.oon; He coW.d see no hint of rationality in the things to which peo- ple responded now. The leader of the profession-on a mean scale, there was no grand scale leffin anything-was Gordon L. Prescott, Chainnan of the Council of American Builders; Gordon L. Prescott who lectured on the transcendental pragmatism of ar- chitecture and social planning, who· puf his feet on tables in drawing rooms, attended formal dinner;s in knickerbocker& pnd criticized the soup aloud. Society people !laid they liked an archi- tect who was a liberal. The A.G.A. still existed, in stiff, hurt dig- nity, but peop•e referred to it as the Old Folks~ Home. The Council of American Builders ruled the profession and talked about a closed shop, though no one had yet deVised a way of achieving that. Whenever an architect's name appeared . in Ellsworth Toohey's cohmm, it was always that of Augustus Webb. At thirty-nine, Keating heard himself des:¢ribed as old- fashioned. He had given up trying to understand. He knew dimly that the explanation of the change swallowing the world was of a nature he preferred not to know. In his youth be h!ld felt an amicable contempt for the works of Guy Francon or Ralston Holcombe, _and emUlating them bad seeined no more than innocent quackery. But he knew _that Gordon L. Prescott and Gus Webb represented so impertinent, so vicious a fraud that to suspend the evidence of his eyes was beyond his elastic capacity. He had believed that people found greatness in Holcombe and there had been a rea- sonable satisfaction in borrowing his borrowed greatness. He 562"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"' knew that no one saw anything whatever in Prescott. He felt - something dark and leering in the manner with which people spoke of Prescott's genius; as if they were not doing homage to Prescott, but spitting upon genius.

Toohey's eyes were warm, amused, encouraging. Toohey had answered the telephone in person; Toohey had granted him the appointment at once.

We're old friends. . \"Oh dear me,\" said Toohey, yawning, \"one gefs so tiredt There comes a moment into every man's day when he gets the urge to relax like a stumble bum.

He had understood that. The name. And while his sole hope of grace rested in Toohey, something inexplicable twisted within him, he leaned forward, knowing that this would hurt, wishing it. to hurt Toohey, and his lips curled in- credibly into a smile, baring his teeth and gums: .. . . \"Yo1,1 failed there, didn't you, Ellsworth?

But he gave voice to the things himself when he asked: ·\"This is the Enright House, isn't it?\" \"Yes.\" \"You built it?\" Roark nodded, and.said: \"Sit down, Peter, ... understanding too well. · Keating liad brought his briefcase; he put it down on the floor, propping it against his chair.

Now you're speaking my language.'' \"What do you wantT' \"Now listen to me. I've been working on the problem of low- rent housing for years. I never thought of the poor people in slums. I thought of the potentialities of our modern world. The new materials, the means, the chances to take and use. There are so many. products of man's genius around us today. There are such great possibilities to exploit. To build cheaply, simply, intel- ligently. I've had a lot of time to study. I didn't have much to do after the Stoddard Temple. I didn't expect results. I worked be- cause I can't look at any material without thinking: What could be done with it? And the moment I think that, J've got to do it. To find the answer, to break the thing. I've worked on it for . years, I loved it. I worlted because it was a problem I wanted to 577"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"solve. You wish to know how to build a unit to rent for fifteen dollars a month? I'll show you how to build it for ten.\" Keating made an involuntary movement forward. \"But first, I want you to think and tell me what made me give years to this work. ,Money? Fame? Charity? Altruism?\" Keating shook his head slowly. \"All right. You're beginning to under- stand. So whatever we do, don't let's talk about the poor people in the slums. They have nothing to do with it, though I wouldn't · envy anyone the job of trying to explain that to fools. You see, I'm never concerned with my clients, only with their architec- tural requirements. I consider these as part of my building's theme and problem, as my building's material-just as I consider bricks and steel. Bricks and steel are not my motive. Neither are the clients. Both are only the means of my work. Peter, before you can do things for people, you must be the kind of man who can get things done. But to get things done, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences. The work, not the peo- ple. Your .own action, not any possible object of your charity. I'll be glad if people who need it find a better manner of living in a house I designed. But that's not the motive of my work. Nor my reason. Nor my reward.\" He walked to a window and stood looking out at the lights of the city trembling in the dark river. \"You said yesterday: What architect isn't interested in hous- - ing? I hate the whole blasted idea of it. I think it's a worthy undertaking--,....to provide a decent apartment for a man who earns fifteen dollars a week. But not at the expense of other men. Not if it raises the taxes, raises all the other rents. and makes the man who earns forty live in a rat hole. That's what's happening in New York. Nobody can afford a modem apartment-except the very rich and the paupers. Have you seen the converted brown- stones in which the average self-supporting couple has to live? Have you seen their closet kitchens and their plumbing? They're forced to live like that-because they're not incompetent enough. They make forty dollars a week and wouldn't be allowed into a housing project. But they're the ones who provide the money for the damn project. They pay the taxes. And the taxes raise their own rent. And they have to move from a converted brownstone into an unconverted one and from that into a railroad flat. I'd have no desire to penalize a man because he's worth only fifteen dollars a week. But I'll be damned if I can see why a man worth forty must be penalized-and penalized in favor of the one who's less competent. Sure, there are a Jot of theories on the subject and volumes of discussion. But just look at the results. Still, ar- chitects are all for government housing. And have you ever seen an architect whQ wasn't screaming for planned cities? I'd like to ask him how he can be so sure that the plan adopted will be his own. And if it is, what right has he to impose it on the others? 578"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"And if it isn't, what happens to his work?

But Cortlandt ... \" \"Yes. Cortlandt. Well, I've told you all the things in which I don't believe, so that you'll understand what I want and what right I have to want it I don't believe in government housing. I don't want to hear anything about its noble purposes. I don't think they're noble. But that, too, doesn't matter. That's not my first concern. Not who lives in the house nor who orders it built Only the house itself. If it has to be built, it might as well be built right~' \"You ... want to build it?'' \"In all the years I've worked on this problem, I never hoped to see the results in practical application. I forced myself not to hope. I knew I couldn't expect a chance to show what could be done on a large scale. Your government housing, among other things, has made all building so expensive that private owners can't afford such projects, nor any type of low-rent construction. And I will never be given any job by any government You've understood that much yourself. You. said I couldn't get past Toohey. He's not the only one. I've never been given a job by any group, board, council or committee, public or private, unless some man fought for me, like Kent Lansing. There's a reason for · that, but we don't have to discuss it now. I want you to know only that I realize in what manner I need you, so that what we'll do will be a fair exchange.\" \"You need me?'' \"Peter, I love this work. I want to see it erected. I want to make it real, living, functioning, built But every living thing is integrated. Do· you know what that means? Whole, pure, com- plete, unbroken.

With my whole mind.\" \"Then here's what I'm offering you: I'll design Cortlandt. You'll put your name on it. You'll keep all the fees. But you'll guarantee that it will be built exactly as I design it.\" Keating IQOked at him and held the glance deliberately, quietly, for a moment. \"All right, Howard.\" He added: \"I waited, to show you that I know exactly what you're asking and what I'm promising.\" \"You know it won't be easy?\" \"I know it will be very terribly difficult.\" \"It will. Because it's such a large project. Most particularly be- cause it's a government projeet.

You will have to have the courage of my convictions.\" · \"I'll try to live up to that, Howard.\" \"You won't be able to, unless you understand that I'm giving you a trust which is more sacred-and nobler, if you like the word-than any altruistic purpose you could name.

I will have no guarantee except your word. Wish to give it to me?\" \"I give you my word.\" Roark took two typewritten sheets of paper from his pocket and banded them to him. · \"Sign it.\" \"What's thatT \"A contract between us, stating the terms of our agreement. A copy for each of us. It would probably have no legal validity whatever. But I can hold it over your head. I couldn't sue you But I could make this public.

Keating sat looking at him for a moment, then said slowly, as if trying to distinguish the dim. form of some thought of his own: \"Everybody would say you're a fool. ...

It will work. It will be all right. You've done something wonderful. You haven't spoiled everything by thanking me.\" Keating nodded silently. \"Now relax, Peter. Want a drink? We won't discuss any details tonight. Just sit there and get used to me. Stop being afraid of me. Forget everything you said yesterday. This wipes it off. We're startirig from the beginning. We're partners now. You have your share to do. It's a legitimate share. This is my idea of co- operation, by the way. You'll handle people. I'll do the building. We'll each do the job we know best, as honestly as we can.\" He walked to Keating and extended his hand. Sitting still, not raising his head, Keating took the hand. His fingers tightened on it for a moment. When Roark brought him a drink, Keating swallowed three long gulps and sat looking at the room. His fingers were closed firmly about the glass, his arm steady; but .the ice tinkled in the liquid once in a while, without apparent motion. His eyes moved heavily over the room, over Roark's body. He thought, it's not intentional, not just to hurt me, he can't help it, he doesn't even know it-but it's in his whole body, that look of a creature glad to be alive. And he realized he had never actually believed that any living thing could be glad of the gift of exis- tence. \"You're ... so young, Howard .... You're so young ... Once I reproached you for being too old and serious . . . Do you re- member when you worked for me at Francon's?\" \"Drop it, Peter.

Maybe they don't mean what people have been taught to think they mean. But let's drop that now.

He took a longer time than he needed. When he could trust himself to lift his eyes, he shook his head in silent answer to the word Keating had not pro- nounced. \"It's too late, Peter,\" he said gently. Keating nodded. \"Guess I ... knew that.\" When Keating had gone, Roark leaned against the door, clos- ing his eyes. He was sick with pity. He had never felt this before-not· when Henry Cameron col- lapsed in the office at his feet, not when he saw Steven Mallory sobbing on a. bed before him. Those moments had been clean. But this was ·pity-this complete awareness of a man without 582"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"worth or hope, this sense of finality, of the not to be redeemed. There was shame in this feeling-his own shame that he should have to pronounce- such judgment upon a man, that he should know an emotion which contained no shred of respect. This is pity, he thought; and then he lifted his head in wonder. He thought that there must be something terribly wrong with a world in which this monstrous feeling is called a virtue. 9 ' THEY sat on the shore of the lake-Wynand slouched ·on a boulder-Roark stretched out cin the ground-Dominique sitting, straight, ,her body rising stiffly from the pale blue circle of her skirt on the grass. ~ The Wynand house stood on the hill above theDL -The earth spread out in terraced fields and rose gradually to make the ele- vation of the hill. The house was a shape of horizontal rectangles rising· toward a slashing vertical projection; a group of diminish- ing setbacks, each a separate room, _its size and form making the successive steps in a series of interlocking floor lines. It was as if from the wide living room on the first level a hand had moved slowly, shaping the next steps by· a sustained touch, then had stopped, had continued in separate movements, each shorter, brusquer, and had ended, tom off, remaining somewhere in the sky. So that it seemed as if the slow rhythm of the rising fields had been picked up, stressed, accelerated and broken into the staccato chords of the finale.- ''1 like to look at it from here,\" said Wynand. \"I spent all day here yesterday, watching the light change on it. When you design a building, Howard, do you know exactly what the sun will do to it at any moment of the day from any angle? Do you control the sun?'' \"Sure,\" said Roark without raising his head. \"Unfortunately, I can't control it here. Move over, Gail. You're in my way. I like the sun on my back.\" Wynand ·let himself flop down into the grass. Roark lay - stretched on his stomach, his face buried on his arm, the oraDge haii' on the white shirt· sleeve, one hand extended before him, palm pressed to the ground. Dominique looked at the blades of grass between his fingers. The· fingers moved once in a while, crushing the grass with lazy, sensuous pleasure. · The lake spread behind them, a flat sheet darkening at the edges, as if the distant trees were moving in to enclose it for the evening. The sun cut a glittering band across the water. Domi- nique looked up at the house and thought that she would like to stand there at a window and look down and see this one white 583"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"figure stretched on· a deserted shore, his hand on the ground; spent, emptied, at the foot of that hill. · · She had lived in the house for a month. She had never thought she would. Then Roark· had said: ''The house will be ready for you in ten days, Mrs. Wynand.\" and she had answered: \"Yes, Mr. Roark.\" She accepted the house, the touch of the stair railings under her hand, the walls that enclosed the air she breathed. She ac- cepted the light switches she pressed in the evening, and the light firm wires he bad laid out through the walls; the water that ran when she turned a tap, from conduits he bad planned; the warmth of an open fire on August evenings, before a fireplace built stone by stone .from his· drawing. She thought: Every moment ... every need of my existence ... She thought: Why not? ICs the same with my body-lungs, blood vessels, nerves, brain-under the same control. She felt one with the house. She accepted the nights when she lay in Wynand's · arms and opened her eyes .to· see the shape of the bedroom Roark had de:.. signed, and she set her teeth agairist a racking pleasure that was part answer, part mockery of the unsatisfied hunger in her body, and surrendered to it, not knowing what man gave her this, which one of them; or both. Wynand watched her as she walked across a room, as she de- scended the stairs, as she stood. at a window. She had heard him saying to her: \"I didn't know a house could be designed for a woman, .like a dtess. You can't see yourself here as I do, you can't see· how completely this house is yours. Every angle, every part of every room is a setting for you. It's scaled to your height, to your body. Even the texture of the walls goes with the texture of your skin in an odd way. It's the Stoddard Temple, but built for..a single person, and it's mine. This is what I wanted. The city can't touch you here. ·I've always felt that the city would take you away from me. It gave me everything I have. I don't know why I feel at times that it will demand payment some day. But here you're safe and you're mine.\" She wanted to cry: Gail, I be- long to him here as I've never belonged to him. Roark was the only guest Wynand allowed in their new home. Sbe accepted Roark's visits to them on week ends. That was the hardest to accept She knew he. did not come to torture her, but simply because Wynand .asked him· and he liked being with Wynand. She\" remembered saying to him in the evening, her hand on the stair railing, on the steps of the stairs leading up to her bedroom: \"Come down to breakfast whenever you wish, Mr. Roark. Just press the button· in the dining room.\" ''Thank you, Mrs .. Wynand. Good night.\" Once, she saw him alone, for a moment It was early morning; she had not slept all night, thinking of him in a room across the hall; she had come out before the house was awake. She walked 584"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"down the hill and she found relief in the unnatural stillness of the earth around her, the. stillness of full light without sun, of leaves without motion, of a luminous, waiting silence. She heard steps behind her, she stopped, she leaned against a tree trunk. He had a bathing suit thrown over his shoulder, he was going down to swim in the lake. He stopped before her, and they stood still with the rest of the earth, looking at each other. He said nothing, turned, and went on. She remained leaning against the tree, and after a while ·she walked back to the house. Now, sitting by the lake, she heard Wynand saying to him: \"You look like the laziest creawre in. the world, Howard.\" \"I am.\" . \"I've never seen anyone relax like that.\" \"Try staying awake for three nights in succession.\" \"I told you to get here yesterday.\" \"Couldn't.\" \"Are you going to pass out right hereT' . \"I'd like to. This is wonderful.\" He lifted his head, his eyes laughing, as if he had not seen the building on the hill, as if he were not speaking of it. ''This is the way I'd like to die, stretched out on some shore like this, just close my eyes and never come back.\" She thought: He thinks what I'm thinking-we· still have that together-Gail wouldn't understand-not he and Gail, for this onc~e and I. Wynand said: \"You damn fool. This is not like you, not even as· a joke. You're killing yourself over somelhing~ WhatT' ''Ventilator shafts, at the moment. Very stubborn ventilator shafts.\" \"For whomT' \"Clients .... I have all sorts of clients right now.\" \"Do you have to work nights?\"· \"Yes-for these particular people. Very special work. Can't even bring it into the office.\" \"What are you talking aboutT' ''Nothing. Don't pay any attention. I'm half asleep.\" She thought: This is the tribute to Gail, ·the confidence of surrender-he relaxes like a cat-and cats don't relax except with people they like. ''I'll kick you upstairs after dinner and lock the door,\" said Wynand, \"and leave you there to sleep twelve hours.\" \"All right.\" \"Want to get up early? Let's go for a swim before sunrise.\" ''Mr. Roark is tired, Gail,\" said Dominique, her voice sharp. Roark raised himself on an elbow to look at her. She saw his eyes, direct, understanding. \"You're acquiring the bad habits of all commuters, Gail,\" she said, \"imposing your country hours on guests from the city who 585"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"are not used to them.\" She thought: Let it be mint>--that onemo- ment when you were walkiilg to the lake-don't let Gail take that also, like everything else. ''You can't order Mr. Roark around as if he were an employee of the Banner.\" \"I don't know anyone on earth I'd rather order around than Mr. Roark,\" said Wynand gaily, \"whenever I can get away with it.\" \"You're getting away with it.\" \"I don't mind taking orders, Mrs. Wynand,\" said Roark. \"Not from a man as capable as Gail.\" Let me win this time, she thought, please let me win this time-it means nothing to you-it's senseless and it means noth- ing at all-but refuse him, refuse him for the sake of the memory of a moment's pause that had not belonged to him. \"I think you should rest, Mr. Roark. You should sleep late to- morrow. I'll tell the servants not to disturb you.\" \"Why, no, thanks, I'll be all right i!l a few hours, Mrs. Wynand. I like to swim before breakfast. Knock at the door when you're ready, Gail, and we'll go down together.\" She looked over the spread of lake and hills, with not a sign of men, not another house anywhere, just water, trees and sun, a world of their own, and she thought he was right-they belonged together-the three of them. The drawings of Cortlandt Homes presented six buildings, fif- teen stories high, each made in the shape of an irregular star with arms extending from a central shaft. The shafts contained eleva- tors, stairways, heating systems and all the utilities. The apart- ments radiated from the center in the form of extended triangles. The space between the arms allowed light· and air from three sides. The ceilings were pre-cast; the initer walls were of plastic tile that required no painting or plastering; all pipes and wires were laid out in metal ducts at the edge of the floors, to be opened and replaced, when necessary, without costly demolition; the kitchens and bathrooms were prefabricated as complete units; the initer partitions were of light metal th'at could be folded into the walls to provide one large room or pulled out to divide it; there were few halls or lobbies to clean, a minimum of cost and labor required for the maintenance of the place. The entire plan was a composition in triangles. The buildings, of poured con- crete, were a complex modeling of simple structural features; there was no ornament; none was needed; the shapes had the beauty of sculpture. Ellsworth Toohey did not look at the plans which Keating had spread out on his desk. He stared at the perspective drawings. He stared, his mouth open. · Then he threw his head back and howled with laughter. \"Peter,\" he said, ''you're a genius.\" 586"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"He added: \"I think you know exactly what I mean.\" Keating looked at him blankly, without curiosity. \"You've succeeded in what I've spent a lifetime trying to achieve, in what centuries of men and bloody battles behind us have tried to achieve. I take my bat off to you, Peter, in awe and admiration.\" \"Look at the plans,\" said Keating listlessly. \"It will rent for ten dollars a unit.\" \"I haven't the slightest dou~t that it will. I don't have to look. Oh yes, Peter, this will go through. Don't worry. This will be ac- cepted. My congratulations, Peter.\" \"You God-d.!mm fool!'; said Gail Wynand. ''What are you up to?\" · He threw to Roark a copy of the Batme_r, folded at an inside page. The page bore -a photograph captioned: \"Architects' draw- ing of Cortlandt Homes, the $15,000,000 Federal Housing P-roj- ect to be built in Astoria, L. 1., Keating & Dumont. architects.\" Roark glanced at the photograph and :asked: \"What do you mean?'' . · \"Yoif know damn well what I mean. Do you think I picked the things in my art gallery by their signatures? If Peter Keating de- signed this, I'll eat every copy of toda,y's Banner.\" \"Peter Keating designed this, Gail.\" \"You fool. What are you after?'' \"If I don't want to understand what you're talking about, I won~t understand it, no matter what you say.\" . \"Oh, you might, if I run a story to the effect that a. certl;lin housing project was designed by Howard Roark, which would make a swell exclusive story and a joke on one Mr. Toohey who's the boy behind the boys on most of those damn projects.\" \"You publish that and I'll sue hell out of you.\" \"You really would?'' · \"I would. Drop it, Gail. Don't you see I don't want to discuss it?'' . Later, Wynand showed the picture to Dominique and asked:.. \"Who designed this?\" She looked at it. \"Of course,\" was all she answered. ''What kind of 'changing world,' Alvah? Changing to what? From what? Who's doing the changing?'' · Parts of Alvah Scarret's face looked anxious, but most of it was impatient, as he glanced at the proofs of his editorial on \"Motherhood in a Changing World,\" which lay on Wynand's desk. . . · ''What the bell, Gail,\" he muttered indifferently. · . \"That's what I want to know-what the hell?'' He picked up the. proof and read aloud: \" 'The world we have _known is gone and done for and it's no use kidding ourselves about it. We can- 587"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"not go back; we must go forwanL The mothers of today must set the example by broadening their own emotional view and raising their selfish love for their own children to a higher plane, to in- clude everybody's little children.

It's all right to dish out crap. But-this kind of crap?\" . Alvah Scarret would not look at him. \"You're out of step with the times, Gail,\" he said. His voice was low; it had a tone of warning-as of something baring its teeth, tentatively, just for future reference. This was so odd a behavior for Alvl!h Scarret that Wynand lost all desire to pursue the conversation. He drew a line across the editorial, but the blue pencil stroke seemed tired and ended in a blur. He said: \"Go and bat out ~omething else, Alvah.\" Scarret rose, picked up the strip of paper, turned and left the room without a word. Wynand looked after him, puzzled, amused and slightly sick. He had known for several years the trend which his paper had embraced gradually, impercepb\"bly, without. any directive from him. He had noticed the cautious \"slanting\" of news stories, the half-.hints, the vague allusions, the peculiar adjectives peculiarly placed, the stressing of certain themes, the insertion of political conclusions where none was needed. If a story concerned a dis- pute between employer and employee, ·the employer was made to appear guilty, simply through wording, no matter what the facts presented. If a sentence referred to the past, it was always \"our dark- past\" or ·\"our dead past.\" If a statement involved someone's personal motive, it was always \"goaded by selfishness\" or \"egged ·by greed.\" A crossword ptizile gave the definition of \"obsolescent individuals\" and the word came out as \"capitalists.\" Wynand had shrugged about it, contemptuously amused. His staff, he thought, was well trained: if this was the popular slang of the day, his boys assumed it automatically. It meant nothing at all. He kept it off the editorial page and the rest did not matter. It was no more than a fashion of the moment-and he had sur- vived many changing fashions. -. · . _ He felt no concern over the \"We Don't Read Wynand\" cam- paign. He obtained one of their men's-room stickers, pasted it on the windshield of his own Lincoln, added the words: ''We don't either,\" and kept it there long enough to be discovered and snapped by a photographer from a neutral paper. In the course of his career he had been fought, damned, denounced by the great- est publishers of his time, by the shrewdest coalitions of financial power. He could not summon any apprehension over the activi- ties of somebody named Gus Webb. 588"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"He knew that the Banner was losing some of its popularity. \"A temporary fad,\" he toJd.Scarret, shrugging. He would run a lim- · erick contest, or a series of coupons for victrola records, see a slight spurt of circulation and promptly forget the matter. He could not rouse himself to full action. He had never felt a greater desire to work. He entered his office each morning with important eagerness. But within an hour he found himself study- ing the joints of the paneling· on the walls and reciting nursery rhymes in his mind. It was not boredom, not the satisfaction of a yawn, but more like the gnawing pull of wishing to yawn and not quite making it. He could not say that he disliked his work. It had merely become distasteful; not enough to force a decision; not enough to make him clench his fists; just enough to contract his nostrils. He thought dimly that the cause lay in that new trend of the public taste. He saw no reason why he. should not follow it and play on it as expertly as he had played on all other fads. But he could not follow. He felt no moral scruples. It was not a positive stand rationally taken; not defiance in the name of a cause of im- portance; just a fastidious feeling, something pertaining almost to chastity: the hesitation one feels before putting one's foot down into muck. He thought: It doesn't matter-it will not last-l'll be back when the wave swings on to another theme--1 think I'd rather sit this one out. He could not say why the encounter with Alvah Scarret gave him a feeling of uneasiness, sharper than usual. He thought it was funny that Alvah should have switched to that line. of tripe. But there .had ·been something else; there had been a personal quality in Alvah's exit; almost a declaration that he saw no necessity to consider the boss's opinion any longer. I ought to fire Alvah, he thought-and then laughed at himself, aghast: fire Alvah Scarret?--one might as well think of stopping the earth-or-of the unthinkable-of closing the Banner. But through the months of that summer and fall, there were days when he loved the Banner. Then he sat at this desk, with his hand on the pages spread before him, fresh ink smearing his palm, and he smiled as he saw the name of Howard Roark in the pages of the Banner. The word had come down from his office to every department concerned: Plug Howard Roark. In the art section, the real~state section, the editorials, the columns, mentions of Roark and his buildings began to appear regularly. There were not many occa- sions when one could give publicity to an architect, and buildings had little news value, but the Banner managed to throw Roark's name at the public under every kind of ingenious pretext. Wynand edited every word of it. The material was startling on the pages of the Banner: it was written in good taste. There were no sensational stories, no photographs of Roark at breakfast, no 589"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"human interest, no attempts to sell a man; only a considered, gra- cious tribute to the greatness of an iutist. He never spoke of it to Roark. and Roark never mentioned it. They did not discuss the Banner. Coming home to his new bouse in the evening, Wynand saw the Banner on the living-room table every night. He had not al- lowed it in his home since his marriage. He smiled; when he saw it for the first time, and said nothing. Then he spoke of it, one evening. He turned the .pages until he came to an article on the general theme of summer resorts, most of which was a description of Monadnock Valley. He raised his head to glance at Dominique across the room; she sat on the floor by the fireplace. He said: \"'Thank you, dear.\" \"For what, Gail?\" ''For understanding when I would be glad to see the Banner in my house.\" · He walked to her and sat down on the floor beside her. He held her thin shoulders in the curve of his arm. He said: ''Thilik of all. the politicians, movie stars, visiting grand dukes and sashweigbt murderers whom the Banner has trumpeted all .these years. Think of my great crusades about street-car compa- nies, red-light districts . and home-grown vegetables. For once, Dominique, I can say what I believe.\"· \"Yes, Gail ... \" \"All this power I wanted, reached and never used •.. · Now they'll see what I can do. I'll- force them to recognize him as be should be recognized. I'll give him the fame he deserves. Public opinion? Public opinion is what I make it.\" \"Do. you think he wants this?\" \"Probably not. I don't care. He needs it and he's going to get it. I want him to have it. As an architect, he's public property. He can't stop a newspaper from writing about him if it wants to.\" \"All that copy on him-do you write it yourself?\" \"Most of it.\" \"Gail, what a great journalist you could have been.\" 'Ille campaign brought results, of a kind he had not expected. The general public remained blankly indifferent. But in the intel- lectual circles, in the art world, in the profession, people were laughing at Roark. Comments were reported to Wynand: ''Roark? Oh yes, Wynand's pet.\" .\"The Banner's glamour boy.\" \"The ge- nius of the yellow press.\" ''The Bariner is now selling art-send two box tops or a reasonable facsimile;\" ''Wouldn't you know it? That's what I've always thought of Roark-the kind of talent fit for the Wynand papers.'' ''We'll see,\" ·said Wynand contemptuously-and continued his private crusade. He gave Roark every commission of importance whose owners 590"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"were open to pressure. Since spring, he had brought to Roark's office tlie contracts for a yacht club on the Hudson, an office building, two private residences. \"I'll get you more than you can handle,\" he said. \"I'll make you catch up with all the years they've made you waste.\" Austen Heller said to Roark one evening: \"If I may be so pre- sumptuous, I think you need advice, Howard. Yes, of course, I mean this preposterous business of Mr. Gail Wynand. You and he as inseparable friends upsets every rational concept I've ever held. After all, there are distinct classes of humanity-no, I'm not talking Toohey's language-but there are certain boundary lines among men which cannot be crossed.\" \"Yes, there are. But nobody has ever given the proper state- ment of where they must be drawn.\" ''Well, the friendship is your own business. But there's one as- pect of it that must be stopped-and you're going to listen to me for once.\" \"I'm listening.\" \"I think it's fine, all those commissions he's dumping on you. I'm sure he'll be rewarded for that and lifted several rungs in hell, where he's certain to go. But he must stop that publicity he's splashing you with in the Banner. You've got to make him stop. Don't you know that the support of the Wynand papers is enough to discredit anyone?\" Roark said nothing. \"It's hurting you professionally, Howard.\" \"I know it is.\" \"Are you going to make him stop?\" \"No.\" \"But why in blazes?\" \"I said I'd listen, Austen. I didn't say I'd speak about him.\" Late one afternoon in the fall Wynand came to Roark's office, as he often did at the end of a day, and when they walked out to- gether, he said: \"It's a nice evening. Let's go for a walk, Howard. There's a piece of property I want you to see.\" He led the way to Hell's Kitchen. They walked around a great rectangle-:-two blocks between Ninth Avenue and Eleventh, five blocks from north to south. Roark saw a grimy desolation of ten- ements, sagging hulks of what had been red brick, crooked door- ways, rotting boards, strings of gray underclothing in narrow air shafts, not as a sign of life, but as a malignant growth of decom- position. \"You own that?\" Roark said. \"Ail·of it.\" ''Why show it to me? Don't you know that making an architect look at that is worse than showing him a field of unburied corpses?\" . Wynand pointed to the white-tiled front of a new diner across the street: \"Let's go in there.\" 591"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"They sat by th~ window, at a clean metal table, and Wynand ordered .coffee. He· seemed as graciously at home as in the best restaurants of the city; his. elegance had an odd quality here-it did not insult the place, but seemed to transform it, like the pres- ence of a king who never alterS his manner, yet makes a palace of any house he enters. He leaned forward with his elbows on the table, watching Roark through the steam of the coffee, his eyes narrowed, amused. He moved one finger to point across the street. \"That's the first piece of property I ever bought, Howard. It was a· long time ago. J haven't touched it since.\" ''What were you !saving it for?'' \"You.\" · Roark raised the heavy white mug of coffee to his lips, his eyes holding WYJ1and's, narrowed and mocking in answer. He knew that Wynand wanted eager questions and he waited pa- tiently instead. ··'You stubborn bastard,\" Wynand chuckled, surrendering. \"All right. Listen. This is where I was born. When I could begin to think of buYing real estate, l bought this piece. House by house. Block by block. It took !l long time. I could have bought better property and made money fast, as I did later, but I waited until I bad this. Even though I knew I would make no use of it for years.

Of course, everybody says that the day of the skyscraper is past. That it's obsolete. I don't give a damn about .that. I'll make it pay for itself.

Yo~from me.\" 10 IT HAD stopped raining; but Peter Keating wished it would start again. The pavements glistened, there were dark blotches on the walls of buildings, and since it did not come from the sky, it looked as if the city were bathed in cold sweat. The air was heavy with untimely darkness, disquieting like premature old age, and there were yellow puddles of light in windows. Keating had missed the rain, but he felt wet, from his bones out. He had left his office early, and he walked home. The office seemed unreal to him, as it had. for a long time. He could find re- ality only . in the evenings, when he slipped furtively up to 593"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"Roark's apartment. He did not slip and it was not furtive, be told himself angrily-and knew that it was; even though he walked through the lobby of the Enright House and rode up in an eleva- tor, like any man on a legitimate errand. It was the vague anxiety, the impulse to glance around at every face, the fear of being rec- ognized; it was a load of anonymous guilt, not toward any per- son, but the more frightening sense of guilt without a victim. He took from Roark .rough sketches for every detail of Cortlandt-to have them translated into working drawings by his own staff. He listened to Roark's instructions. He memorized ar- guments to offer his employers against every possible objection. He absorbed like a recording machine. Afterward, when he gave explanations to his draftsmen, his voice sounded like a disk being played. He did not mind. He questioned nothing. Now he walked slowly, through the streets full of rain that would not come. He looked up and saw empty space where the towers of familiar buildings had been; it did not look like fog or clouds, but like a solid spread of gray sky that had worked a gi- gantic, soundless destruction. That sight of buildings vanishing through the sky had always made him uneasy. He walked on, looking down. It was the shoes that he noticed first. He knew that he must have seen the woman's face, that the instinct of self~preservation had jerked his glance away from it and let his conscious percep- tion begill with the shoes. They were flat, brown oxfords, offen- sively competent, too well shined on the muddy pavement, contemptuous of rain and of beauty. His eyes went to the brown skirt, to the tailored jacket, costly and cold like a uniform, to the hand with a hole in the finger of an expensive glove, to the lapel that bore a preposterous ornament--.:.a bow-legged Mexican with red-enameled pants-stuck there in a clumsy attempt at pertness; to the thin lips, to the glasses, to the eyes. \"Katie,\" he said. She stood by the window of a bookstore; her gl!Ulce hesitated halfway between recognition and a book title she had been exam- ining; then, with recognition evident in the beginning of a smile, the glance went back to the book title, to finish and make an ef- ficient note of it. Then her eyes re~ed to Keating, Her smile was pleasant; not as an effort over bitterness, and not as wel- come; just pleasant. \"Why, Peter Keating,\" she said. \"Hello, Peter.\" \"Katie ... \" He could not extend his hand or move closer to. her. - \"Yes, imagine running. into you like this, why, New York is just like any small toWD; though I suppose without the better fea- tures.\" There was no strain in her voice. \"What are you doing here? I thought ... I heard ... \" He knew 594"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"she had a good job in Washington and had moved there two years ago. \"Just a business trip.

You haven't changed much, Katie, not really, have you?-1 mean, your face-you look like you used to-:-in a way ... \" · \"It's the only face I've got. Why do people always have to talk about changes if they haven't seen each other for a year or two? I ran into Grace Parker yesterday and she had to go into an in- ventory of my appearance.

I don't know what we're talking about, Katie.\" He thought that she owed him nothing, or every kind of anger and scorn she could command; and yet there was a human obli- gation she still had toward him: she owed him an evidence of strain in this meeting. There was none. \"We really should have a great deal to talk about, Peter.\" The words would have lifted him, had they not been pronounced so easily. \"But we can't stand here all day.\" She glanced at her wrist watch. \"I've got an hour or so, suppose you take me somewhere for a cup of tea, you could use some hot tea, you look frozen.\" That was her first comment on his appearance; that, and a 595"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"glance witltout reaction. He -thought, even Roark had been shocked, had acknowledged the change. \"Yes, Katie. That will be wonderful. I ... \" He wished she bad not been the one to suggest it; it was the right thing for them to do; be wished she had not been able to think of the right thing; not so quickly. \"Let's find a nice, quiet place ... \" \"We'll go to Thorpe's. There's one around the corner. They have the nicest watercress sandwiches.\" It was she who took his arm to cross the street, and dropped it again on the. other side. The ge~ture had been automatic. She had not noticed it. There was a counter of pastry and candy inside the door of Thorpe's. A large bowl of sugar-coated almonds, green and white, glared at Keating. Tbe place smelled of orange icing. The lights were dim, a .stuffy orange haze; the odor made the light seemsticky .. The tables were too·sman, set close together. He sat, looking down at a paper lace doily on a black glass ta- ble top. But when be lifted his eyes to Catherine, be knew that no caution was necessary: she did not react to his scrutiny; her expression remained the same, whether. be studied her face or that of the woman at the next table; she seemed to have no con- sciousness of her own person. It was her mouth that bad changed most, be thought; the lips were drawn in, with only a pale edge of flesh left around the im- perious line of their opening; a mouth to issue orders, be thought, but not big orders or cruel orders;.just mean little ones-about plumbing and disinfectants. He saw the fine wrinkles at the cor- ners of her eyes-a skin like paper that bad been crumpled and then smoothed out. . c- She was telling him about her work in Washington, and he lis- tened bleakly. He did not hear the words, only the tone of her voice,· dry and erackling. A waitress in a starched orchid uniform came to take their or- ders. Catherine snapped: · \"The tea sandwiches special. Please.\" Keatirig said: \"A cup of coffee.\" He saw Catherine's eyes on him, and in a sudden panic of embarrassment, feeling be must not confess that he couldn't swallow a bite of food now, feeling that the confes- sion would anger her, be added: \"A bam and swiss on rye, I guess.\" \"Peter, what ghastly food habits! Wait a minute, waitress. You don't want that, Peter. It's very bad for you. You should have a fresh salad. And coffee is. bad at this time of the day. Americans drink. too much coffee.\" . •• All right,'' said Keating. \"Tea and a combination salad, waitress . . . And-ob, 596"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"waitressl-no bread with the salad-you're . gaining weight, Peter-some diet crackers. Please.\" Keating waited until the orchid uniform had moved away, and then he said, hopefully: \"I have changed, haven't I, Katie? I do look pretty awful?\" Even a disparaging comment would be a personal link. \"What? Oh, I guess so. It isn't healthy. But Americans know nothing whatever about the proper nutritional balance. Of course, men· do make too much fuss over mere appearance. They're much vainer than. women. It's really women who're taking cbal'ge, of all productive work now, and womeri will build a better •orld.\" \"How does one build a better world, Katie?\" \"Well, if you consider the determining factor, which is, of urse, economic ... \" \"No, I ... I didn't ask it that way .... Katie, I've been very unhappy.\" . \"I'm sorry to hear that. One hears so many people say that nowadays. That's because it's a transition period and people feel rootless.

And divorced.\" ' ''Yes, I read about that. I was glad when you were divorced.\" He leaned forward. \"H your wife was the kind of woman who could marry Gail Wynand, you were luclry to get rid of her.\" The tone of chronic impatience that ran wotds together had not altered to pronoUnce this. He had to believe it this was all the sub- ject meant to her .. \"Katie, you're very tactful and kind ... but drop the act,\" he said, knowing in dread that it was not an act. \"Drop it .... Tell me what you thought of me then .... Say everything . : . I don't mind .... I Want to hear it. ... Don't you understand?

I'd say it\" was conceited of you, if it weren't so child- ish.\" \"What did you feel-that day-'-when I didn't com~and then you heard I was married?\" He did not know what instinct drove him, through numbness, to be brutal as the only means left to him. \"Katie, you suffered then?\" \"Yes; of course I suffered. All young people do in such situa- tions. It seems foolish afterward.

All the conventional things, I suppose, _everybody goes through them, like measles.

''And ofcourse we knew it wa8 for the best. I can't imagine myself mmied tO you.\" \"You. can't imagine it, Katie?'' \"That is, nor to anyone else. It wouldn't have worked, Peter. I'm temperamentally unsuited to domesticity. It's too selfish and narrow. Of course, l understand what you feel just now and I ap- preciate it. It's only human that you should feel something like remorse, since you did what is known as jilted me.\" He winced. \"You see how stupid those things sound. It's natural for you to be a little contrit~ normal reftex.:....t>ut we must look at it ob- jectively, we're grown-up, rational.people;nothing is too serious, we can't really help what we do, we're conditioned that way, we just charge it off to experience and go on from there.\" \"Katie! You're not talking some fallen girl out of her problem. You're speaking about yourself.\" · \"Is there any essential difference? Everybody's problems are the same, just like everybody's emotions.\" He saw her nibbling _a thin strip of bread with a smear of green, and noticed that his order had been served. He moved his fork about in his salad bowl,' and be made himself bite into a gray piece of diet cracker. Then he discovered how strange it was when one lost the knack of eating automatically and had to do it by full conscious effort; the cracker seemed inexhaustible; he could not finish the process of chewing; he moved his jaws with- out reducing the amount of gritty pulp in his mouth. \"Katie ... for six years ... I thought of how I'd ask your for- giveness some day. And now I have the chance, but I won't ask it. It seems ... it seems beside the point. I know it's horrible to say that, but that's how it seems to me. It was the worst thing I ever did· in my life-but not because I burt you. I did hurt you, Katie, and maybe more thll;ll .you know yourself. But that's not my worst guilt. ... Katie, I wanted to marry you. It was the only thing I ever really wanted.

It's the hardest thing· in the world-to do what we want And it takes the greatest kind of coqrage. I mean, what we really want. As I wanted to marry you.

You were a charm- ing boy, Peter.\" It was the bowl of sugar-coated almonds on the counter that hurt him, he thought in a dull anger; The almonds were green and white; they had no business being green and white at this time of the year; the colors of St. Patrick's Day-then there was always candy like that in all the store windows-and St. Patrick's Day meant spring-no, better than spring, that moment ·of won4erful anticipation just before spring is to begin. \"Katie, I won't say that I'm still in love with you. I don't know whether I am or not. I've never asked myself. It wouldn't matter now. I'm not saying this because I hope for anything. or think of trying or ... I know only that I loved you, Katie, I loved you, whatever I made of it, ev:en if this is how I've got to say it for the last time, I loved you, Katie.\" She looked at him-and she seemed pleased. Not stirred, .not happy, not pitying; but pleased in a casQal way. He thought: If she were completely the spinster, the frustrated social workei, as people think of those women, the kind who would scorn SeX in the haughty conceit of her own virtue, that would still be recog- nition, if only in hostility. ·But this-this amused tolerance · seemed to admit that romance was only human, one had tO take it, like everybody else, it was a popular. weakness of no great consequence-she was gratified as she would have been gratified by the same. words from any other man-it was like that red- enamel Mexican on her lapel, a contemptuous concession to peo- ple's demand of vanity. \"Katie ...

Why shouldn't we?· I mean, as you said, like grown-up people, not fooling ourselves, not trying to hope, but only to look back at it. . . . Do you re- member when I came to your house in New York for the first time? You looked so thin and small, and your hair hung every which way. I told you I would riever love anyone else. I held you on my lap, you didn't weigh anything at all, and I told you I would never love anyone else. And you said you knew it.\" \"I remember.\" · \"When we were together ...

But one's perspective widens. One grows richer spiritually with the years.\" He kept silent for a long time. Then he said, his voice flat: ''I'm sorry.\" \"Why? You're very sweet, Peter. I've always said men are the sentimentalists.\" He thought: It's not an act-one can't put on an act like that- unless it's an act inside, for oneself, and then there is no limit, no way out, .no reality .... She went on talking to him, and after a while it was about Washington· again. He answered when it was necessary. He thought that he had believed it was a simple sequence, the past and the present, and if there was loss in the past one was compensated by pain in the present, and pain gave it a form of immortality-but he had not known that one could destroy like this, kill retroactively-so that to her it had never existed. She glanced at her wrist watch and gave a little gasp of impa- . tience. \"I'm late already. I must run along.\" He said heavily: \"Do you mind if I don't go with you, Katie? It's not rudeness. I just thiDk it's better.\" · \"But of course. Not at all. I'm quite able to find my way in the streets and there's no need for formalities among old friends.\" She added, gathering her bag and gloves, crumpling a paper nap- kin into a ball, dropping it neatly into her teacup: \"I'll give you a ring next time I'm in town and we'll have a bite together again. Though I can't promise when that will be. I'm so busy, I have to go so many places, last month it was Detroit and next week I'm flying to St. Louis, but when they shoot me out to New York again, I'll ring you up, so long, Peter; it was ever so nice.\" 11 GAIL WYNAND looked at the shining wood of the yacht deck. The wood and a brass doorknob that had become a smear of fire gave him a sense of everything around him: the miles of space filled with sun, between the burning spreads of sky and ocean. It was 600"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"February, and the yacht lay still, her engines idle, in the southern Pacific. He leaned on the rail and looked down at Roark in the water. Roark floated on his back, his body stretched into a straight line, arms spread, eyes closed. The tan of his skin implied a month of days such as this. Wynand thought that this was the way he liked to apprehend space and time: through the power of his yacht, · through the tan of Roark's skin or the sunbrow~ of his own arms folded before him on the rail. He had not sailed his yacht for several years. This time he had wanted Roark to be his o~y guest. Dominique was left behind. Wyn~d had said: \"You're killing yourself, Howard. You've been going at a pace nobody can stand for long. Ever since Mo- nadnock, isn't it? Think you'd have the courage to perform the feat most difficult for you-to rest?'' . .He was astonished when Roark accepted without argument. Roark laughed: \"I'm not running away from my work, if that's what surprises you. I know when to stop-and I can't stop, unless it's com- pletely. I know I've overdone it. I've been wasting-too much pa- per lately and doing awful stuff.\" · \"Do you ever do awful stuff?'' \"Probably more of it than any other architect and with less ex- cuse. The only distinction I can claim is that my botches end up in my own wastebasket.\" \"l warn yoq, we'll be away for months. If you begin to regret it and cry for your drafting table in a week, like all men who've never learned to loaf, I won't take you back. I'm the worst kind of dictator aboard my yacht. You'll have everything you can imagine, except paper or pencils. I won't even leave you any freedom: of speech. No mention of girders, plastics or reinforced concrete once you step on board. I'll teach you to eat, sleep and exist like the most worthless millionaire.\" ''I'd like to try that.'' The work in the office did not require Roark's presence for the next few months. His current jobs were being completed. Two new commissions were not to be started until spring. He had made all the sketches Keating needed for Cortlandt. The construction was about to begin. Before sailing; on a day in late December, Roark went to take a last look at the site of Cortlandt. An anonymous spectator in a group of the idle curious; he stood and watched the steam shovels biting the earth, breaking the way for future foundations. The East River was a broad band of sluggish black water; and beyond, in a -sparse haze of snow- flakes, the towers of the city stood softened, half suggested in watercolors of orchid and blue. Dominique did not protest when Wynand told her that be wanted to sail on a long cruise with Roark. ''Dearest, you under- 601"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"stand that it's not running away from you?\"! just nee4 some time taken out of everything. Being with Howard is like being alone with myself, only more at peace.\" ''Of course, Gail. I don't mind.\" But he looked at her, and suc:idenly he laughed, incredulously pleased. 'fDominique, I believe. you're jealous. It's wonderful, I'm more grateful to him than ever-if it could make you jealous ·of me\" She. could not tell him that she was jealous or of whom. The yacht sailed at the end of December. Roark watched, grin- ning; Wynand's disappointment when Wynand found that he needed to enforce no discipline. Roark did not speak of build- ings, lay for hours stretched out on deck in the sun, and loafed like an expert. They spoke little. There were days when Wynand could not remember what sentences they had exchanged. It would have seemed possible to him that they had not spoken.at all. Their serenity was their best means of communication. Today they had dived together to swim and Wynand had climbed back first. As he stood at the rail, watching Roark in the water, he thought of the power he held in this 1 moment: he could order the yacht to start moving, sail away and leave that red- headed body to sun and ~· The thought gave him pleasure: the sense of power ~d the sense of surrender to Roark in the knowledge that no conceivable force coUld make him exercise that power. Every physical instrumentality was on his side: a few con~ctions of his vocal cords giving the order and someone's hand opening a valve-and the obedient machine would move away. He thought: It's not just a moral issue, not the mere horror of the act, one could conceivably abandon. a man if the fate of a continent depended on it. But nothing woUld enable him to aban- don this man. He, Gail Wynand, was the helpless one in this mo- ment, with the solid planking of the deck under his feet. Roark, floating like a piece of driftwood, held a power greater than that of the engine in the belly of the yacht. Wynand thought: Because that is the power from which the engine has come. · Roark climbed back on deck; Wynand looked at Roark's body, at the threads of water running down the angUlar planes. He said: \"You made a mistake on the Stoddard Temple, Howard, That statue shoUld have been, not of Dominique, but of you.\" \"No. I'm too egotistical for that.\" \"Egotistical? An egotist would have loved it. You use words in the strangest way.\" ''In the exact way. I don't wish to be the symbol of anything. I'm only myself.\" Stretched in a deck chair, Wynand glanced up with satisfaction at the ·lantern, a disk of frosted· glass on the bulkhead behind him: it cut off the black void of the ocean and gave him privacy 602"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"within solid walls of light. He heard the sound of the yacht's mo- tion, he felt the wann night air on his face, he saw· nothing but the stretch of deck around him, enclosed and final. Roark stood before him at the rail; a tall white figure leaning back against black space, his head lifted as Wynand had seen it lifted in an unfinished building. His hands clasped the rail. The short shirt sleeves left his · anns in the light; vertical ridges of shadow stressed the tensed muscles of his anns and the tendons of his neck. Wynand thought of the yacht's engine, of skyscrap- ers; of transatlantic cables, of everything man had made. \"Howard, this is what I wanted. To have you here with me.'' \"I know.'' · \"Do you know what it really is? Avarice. I'm a miser about two things on earth: you and Dominique. I'm a millionaire who's never owned anything. Do you remember what you s8id about ownership? I'm ·like a savage who's discovered the idea of pri- vate property and run amuck on it. It's funny. Think of Ellsworth Toohey.'' ''Why Ellsworth Toohey?\" \"I mean, the things he preaches, I've been wondering lately · whether he really understands what he's advocating. Selflessness in the absolute sense? Why, that's what I've been. Does he know that I'm the embOdiment of his ideal? Of course, he wouldn't ap- prove of my motive, but motives never alter facts. If it's true selflessness he's after, in the philosophical sense-and Mr. Toohey is a philosopher-in a sense much beyond matters of money, why, let him look at me. I've never owned anything. I've never wanted anything. I didn't give a damn---..,in the most cosJDic way Toohey could ever hope for. I made myself into· a barometer subject to the pressure of the whole world. The voice. of his masses pushed me up and down. Of course, I collected a fortune in the process. Does that change the intrinsic reality of the pic- ture? Suppose I gave away every penny of it. Suppose I had never wished to take any money at all, but had set out in pure al- truism to serve the people. What would I have to do? Exactly what I've done. Give the greatest pleasure to the greatest number. Express the opinions, the desires, the tastes of the majority. The majority that voted me its approval and support freely, in the shape of a three.:.cent ballot dropped at the comer newsstand ev- ery morning. The Wynand papers? For thirty-one years they have represented everybody except.Gail Wynand. I erased my ego out of existence in a way never achieved by any saint in a cloister. Yet people call me corrupt. Why? The saint in a cloister sacri- fices only material. things. It's a small price to pay for the glory of his soul. He hoards his soul and gives up the world. But I-1 took automobiles, silk pyjamas, a penthouse, and gave the world my soul in exchange. Who's sacrificed more-if sacrifice is the test of virtue? Who's.the actual saint?'' 603"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"\"Gail •.. I didn't. think you'd ever admit that to yourself.\" \"Why not? I knew· what I was doing.

It would have to be rammed, since their voluntary choice is the Banner. Well, there are several such altruists in the world today.\" \"You realize-that?'' - ''Of course.

Whe~ does decency start? What begins where altruism ends? Do you see what I'm in love with?\" ''Yes, Gail.\" Wynand had noticed that Roark's voice had a re- luctance that sounded -almost like sadness. ''What's the matter with you? Why do you sound like that?'' \"I'm sorry. Forgive me. It's just something I thought. I've been thinking of this for a long time. And particularly all these days when you've made me lie on deck and loaf.\" ''Thinking about me?'' \"About you--among many other things.\" ''What have you decided?'' ''I'm not an altruist, Gail. I don't decide for others.\" \"You don't have to worry about me. I've sold myself, but I've held no illusions about it. I've never become an Alvah Scarret. He really believes whatever the public believes. I despise the public. That's my only vindication. I've sold my life, but I got a good price. Power. I've never used it. I couldn't afford a personal desire. Bilt now I'm free. Now I can uSc: it for what I want For what I believe. For Dominique. For you.\" Roark turned away. When he looked back at Wynand, he said only: ''I hope so, Gail.\" \"What have you been thinking about these past weeks?'' \"The principle behind the dean who fired me from Stanton.\" ''What principle?'' ''The thing that is destroying the. world. The thing you were talking about. Actual selflessness.\" -''The ideal which they say does not exist?'' 604"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"''They're wrong. It does exist-though not in the way they imagine. It's what I couldn't understand about people for a long time. They have no self. They live within others. They live second-hand. Look at Peter Keating.\" \"You look at him. I hate his guts.\" \"I've looked at him-at what's left of him-and it's helped me to understand. He's paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he's been t90 selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness-in other people's eyes. Fame, admiration, envy-all- that which comes from others. Others dictated his con- victions, which he did not hold, but he -was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn't want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn't want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There~s your actual selflessness. Ies his ego he's betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.\" ''That's the pattern most people follow.\" _ \"Yes! And isn't that the root of every despicable action?<lllot selfishness, but precisely the absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but preserves a respectable front. He knows .himself to be dishonest, but others think he's honest and he derives 'his- self-respect from that, second-hand. The man who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own~ He knows himself to be mediocre, but he's gfeat fu the eyes of others, The frustrated wretch who professes love for the inferior and clings to those_ le11s endowed, in order to establish his own superiority by comparison. The man whose sole aim -is to make money. Now I don't see anything evil in a desire to inake money. But money is only a . means to some end. If a man wants it for a. personal purpose-to invest in his industry, to create, to study, to travel, to enjoy luxury-he's completely moral. But the men. who place money flfSt go much beyond that. Personal luxury is a limited endeavor. What they want is ostentation: to show, to stun, to en- tertain, to impress others. They're second-banders. Look at our so-called cultural endeavors. A lecturer who spouts some bor- rowed rehash of nothing at all that means nothing at all to him- and the people who listen and don't give a damn, but sit there in order to tell their friends that they have attended a lecture by a famous ~.

In the realm of greatest importance-the realm of values, of judgment, of spirit, of thought-they place others above self, in the exact 605"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"manner which altruism demands. A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesn't need it.\" \"I think Toohey understands that. That's what helps him spread his vicious nonsense. Just weakness and cowardice. It's so easy to run to others. It's so hard to stand on one's own record. You can fake virtue for an audience. You can't fake it in your own eyes. Your ego is the strictest judge. They run from it. They spend their lives running. It's easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on per- sonal standards of personal achievement. It's simple to seek sub- stitutes for competence-such easy substitutes: love, charm, kindness, charity. But there is no substitute for competence.\" ''That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They're concerned only with people. They don't ask: 'Is this true?' They ask: 'Is this what others think is true?' Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. What would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists. You don't think through another's brain and you don't work through another's hands. When you suspend your fac- ulty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation-anchored to nothing. That's the emptiness I couldn't understand in people. That's what stopped me whenever l faced a committee. Men without an ego. Opinion without a ra- tional process. Motion without brakes or motor. Power without responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source of his ac- . tio~s is scattered in every other living person. It's everywhere and nowhere and you can't reason with him. He's not open to reason. You can't speak to him-he can't hear. You're tried by an empty bench. A blind mass running amuck, to crush you without sense or purpose. Steve Mallory couldn't define the monster, but he knew. That's the drooling beast he fears. The second-hander.\" ''I think your second-handers understand this, try as they might not to admit it to themselves. Notice how they'll accept anything except a man who stands alone. TheY recognize him at once. By instinct. There's a s~ial, insidious kind of hatred for him. They forgive criminals. They admire dictators. Crime and. violence are a tie. A form of mutual dependence. They need ties. They've got to force their miserable little personalities on every single person they meet. The independent man kills them-because they don't exist within him and that's the only form of existence they know.

Look back at your own life, Howard, and at the people you've met. They know. They're afraid. You're a reproach.\" \"That's because some sense of dignity always remains in \" them. They're still human beings. But they've been taught to seek themselves in others. Yet no man can achieve the· kind of absolute humility that would need no.self-esteem in any form. He wouldn't survive. So after ~;:enturies of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted. By seeking self-esteem through others: By living second-hand. And it has opened the way for every kind of horror. It has become the dreadful form of selfishness which a. truly selfish man couldn't have conceived. And now, ta cure a .. world perishing. from selflessness, we're asked to destroy the self. Listen to what is being preached today.· Look at everyone around us. You've wondered why they suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If any man stopped and asked himself whether he's ever held a truly personal desire,. • he'd find the answer. He'd see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated, by other men. He's notre- ally struggling even for· material wealth, but for the second- bander's. delusion-prestige. A stamp of approval,' not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy w~n he has sue~ ceeded. Jle can't say about a single thing: 'This is what I w~ted because I wanted it; not ~ause it made my neighbors gape at me.' Then he wonders why he's unhappy. Every form of happi- ness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self- motivatect not to be touched. The things which are sacred or precious to us are the things w·~ withdraw from promiscuous sharing. But now we are taught to throw everything within us into public _light and common pawing. To seek joy. in meeting halls. We haven't even got a word for the quality I mean-for the self-sufficiency of man's spirit. It's difficult to call it selfishness or egotism, the words have been perverted, they've come to · mean Peter K~ting. Gail, I think the only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. I've al- ways demanded a certairi quality in the people I liked. I've al- ways recognized it at once-and it's the only quality I respect in men. I chose my friends by that. Now I know what it is. A self- sufficient ego. Nothing else matters.\" \"I'm glad you admit that you have friends.\" ''I even admit that I love them. But I couldn't love them if they were my chief reason for .living. Do you notice that Peter Keating hasn't a single friend left? Do you see why? If one doesn't respect onc;:self one can have .neither love nor respect for others.\" , \"To hell with Peter Keating. I'm thinking of you-and your friends.\" Roark smiled. ''Gail, if this boat were sinking, I'd give my life 607"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"to save you. Not because it's any kind of duty. Only because I like you~ for reasons and standards of my own. I could die for you. But I couldn't and wouldn't live for you.\" \"Howard, what were the reasons and standards?\" Roark looked at bini and realized that he had said all the things he had tried not to say to Wynand. He answered: \"That you weren't born to be a second-bander.'' · Wynand smiled. He beard the sentep.ce-and nothing else. Afterward, when Wynand had gone below to his cabin, Roark remained .alone on deck. He stood at the rail, staring out at the ocean, at nothing. He thought: I haven't mentioned to him the worst se~nd­ hander of all-the man who goes after power. 12 ITwASAprilwhen Roark and Wynand returned to the city. The skyscrapers looked pink . against the blue sky, an incongruous shade of porcelain on: masses of stone. There were small tufts of green on the trees in the streets. Roark went to his office. His staff shook hands with him and he saw the strain of smiles self-conSciously repressed, until a young boy burst out: \"What the hell! Why can't we say how glad we are to see you back, boss?\" Roark laughed. \"Go ahead. I can't teD you ·bow damn glad ·I am to be back.\" Then he sat on a table in the drafting room, while they all reported to him on the past three. months, interrupting one· another; he played with a ruler in his hands, not noticing it, like a man with the feel of his farm's soil under his fingers, after ail absence. In the afternoon; alone at his desk, he ope~ed a newspaper~ He had not seen a newspaper for three months. He noticed an item about the construction of Cortlandt HQmes. He saw the line: \"Pe- ter Keating, architect. Gordon L Prescott and Augustus Webb, associate designers.\" · · He satvery still. That evening he went to see Cortlandt. . The first building was almost completed. It stood alone on the large, empty tract. The workers had left for the day; a small light showed in the shack of the night watchman. The building had the skeleton of What Roark had designed, with the remnants of ten different bree4s piled on the lovely. symmetry of the bones. He saw the economy of plan preserved, but the expense of incompre- · hensible features added; the variety of mQdeled masses gone, re- placed bythe monotony of brutish cubes; a new wing added, with a vaulted roof, bulging out of a wall like a tumor, containing a gymnasium; strings of balconies added, made of metal stripes 608"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"pablteda violent blue; comer windows without purpose; an angle cut off for a useless door, with a round metal awning supported by a pole, like a haberdashery in the Broadway district; three ver- tical bands of brick, leading from nowhere to nowhere; the gen- eral style of what the profession called \"Bronx Modem\"; a panel of bas-relief over the main entrance, representing a mass of mus- cle which could be discerned as either three qr four bodies, one of them with an arm raised, holding a screwdriver. Th~re were white crosses on the fresh panes of glass in the windows, and it looked appropriate, like an error X-ed out ofex- istence. There Will! a band of red in the sky, to the west, beyond Manhattan, and the buildings of the city rose straight and black against it Roark stood ~cross the space of the future road before the first house of Cortlandt. He stood straight, the muscles of his throat pulled, his wrists held down and away from his body, as he would have stood before a firing squad. No one could tell how it had happened. There had been JIO de- liberate intention behind it It had just happened. First, Toohey told Keating one morning that Gordon L. Pres- cott and Gus Webb would be put on the payroll as associate .de- signers. \"What do you car.e, Peter? It won't come out efyour fee. It won't cut your prestige at an, since you're the big boss. They won't be much more than your draftsmen. All I want.is to give the boys a boost. It will help their reputation, to be mgged with this project in some way.l'm.very interested in building up their reputation.\" \"But what for? There's nothing for them to do. It's all done.\" \"Oh, any kind of last-minute drafting. Save time for your own staff. You can share the expense with them. Don't be a hog.\" Toohey had told the truth; he had no other purpose in mind. Keating could not discover what connections Prescott and Webb possessed, with whom, in what office, on what terms- \\UDOng the dozens of officials involved in the project The entan- glement of responsibility was such that no one could be quite certain of anyone's authority. It was clear only that Prescott and Webb had friends, and that Keating could not keep them off the job. The changes began with the gymnasium. The lady in charge of tenant selection demanded a gymnasium. She was a social. worker and her task was to end with the opening of the project. She acquired a permanent job by getting herself appointed Direc- tor of Social Recreation for Cortlandt No gymnasium had been provided in the original plans; there were two. schools and a Y.M.C.A. within walking distance. She declared that this was an outrage against the children of the poor, Prescott and Webb sup- plied the gymnasium. Other changes followed, of a purely es- 609"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"thetic nature. Extras piled on the cost of constrUction so carefully devised for eeonomy. The Qirector of Social Recreation departed for Washington to discuss the matter of a Little Theater and a Meeting ,Hall she wished added to the next two bUildings of Cortlandt~ The changes in the drawings CIIJile gradually, a few at a time. The others okaying the changes came from headqUarters. \"But we're ready to start!\" cried Keating. \"What the hell,'' drawled Gus Webb, \"set 'em back just a coupla thousand .bucks more, that's all.\" \"Now as to the balconies,'' said Gordon L. Prescott, ''they lend a certain modern style. You don't want the damn thing to look so bare. It's depressing. Besides, you don't understand psychology. The people who'lllive here are used to sitting out on fire-escapes. They love it. They'll miss it. You gotta give 'em a place to sit on in the fresh air .... The cost? Hell, if you're so damn worried about the cost, I've got an idea where we can save plenty. We'll do without closet doors. What do they need doors for on closets? It's old-fashioned.\" All the closet doors were omitted. Keating fought. It was the kind of battle he had never entere4, but he tried everything possible to him, to the honest limit of his exhausted strength. He went from office to office, arguing, threatening, pleading. But he had no influence, while his associ- ate designers seemed to cantrol an undergrc:lund river with inter- locking tributaries. The officials shrugged and referred him to someone else. No one cared about an issue of esthetics. ''What's the difference?'' \"It doesn't come out of your pocket; does it?'' ''Who are you to have it all your way? Let the boys contribute something.\" He appealed to Ellsworth Toohey, but Toohey was not inter- ested. He was busy with other matters and he had no desire to provoke a bureaucrirtic quarrel. In all truth, he had not prompted his prot6g6s to their artistic endeavor, but he saw no reason for attempting to stop them. He was amused· by the whole thing. ''But it's awful, Ellsworth! You know it's awful!\" \"Oh, I suppoSE; so. What do you care, Peter? Your poor but unwashed tenants won't be able to appreciate the finer points of architectural art. See that the plumbing works.\" · \"But what for? What for? What for?'' Keating cried to his as- sociate designers. ''Well, why shouldn't we have any say at all?'' asked Gordon L. Prescott. ''We want to express our individuality too.\" . When Keating invoked his contract, he was told: \"All right; go ahead, tty to sue the government.· Try it.\" At times, he felt a de- sire to kill. There was no one to kill. Had he been gr1!11ted the privilege, he could not have chosen a victim. Nobody was re- sponsible. There was no purpose and no cause.

There was no sound in the house; only the srmdl rustle of her hair as she leaned her head back against a chair cushion. In a moment she was not conscious of hearing the car's approach, it was so fa- miliar at this holir; part of the loneliness and privacy outside. She heard the car stop at the door. The door was never locked; there were no neighbors or guests to expect. She beard the door opening, and steps in the hall downstairs. The steps did not pause, but walked with familiar certainty up the stairs. A hand turned the knob of her door. . · It was· Roark. She thought, while she was rising to her feet, that he had never entered her room before; but he knew every part of this house; as he knew everything about her body. She felt no moment of shock, only the memory of one, a shock in the past tense, :the thought: I must have been shocked when I saw him, but not now. Now, by the tiine she was stailding before him, it seemed very simple. She thought: The most important never has to be said between us. It has always been said like .this. He did not want to see me alone. Now he's here. I waited and I'm ready. \"Good evening, Dominique.\" She heard the name pron9unced to fill the space of five years. She said quietly: · 1 'Good evening, Roark.\" ''I want you to help me.\" . She was standing on the station platform of Clayton, Ohio, on the witness stand of the Stoddanl trial, on the ledge of a quarry, to let herself-as she had been then-share this sentence she heard now. \"Yes, Roark.\" He walked across the .room he had designed for her, he sat down, facing her, the width of ·the room between them. She found herself seated too, not conscious of her own movements, only of his, as if his body contained two sets of nerves, his own and hers. ''Next Monday night, Dominique, exactly at eleven-thirty, I want you to drive up to the site of Cortlandt Homes.\" She noticed that she was conscious of her eyelids; not pain- fully, but just eonscious; as if they had tightened and would not move again. She had seen the first building of Cortlandt. She knew what she was about to hear. \"You must be alone in your car and you must be on your way home from some place where yqu had an appointment to visit, made in advance.

See that you're found in the car and that your condition matches its condition-approximately.\" \"Yes, Roark.\" \"Have you understoodT' \"Yes.\" \"EverythingT' \"Yes. Everything.\" They were standing. She saw only his eyes and that he was smiling. She heard him say: \"Good night, Dominique.\" he walked out and she heard his car driving away. She thought of his smile. She knew that he did not need her help for the thing he was going to do, he could find other means to get rid of the watch- man; that he had let her have a part in this, because she would not survive what was to follow if he hadn't; that this had been ·the test. · He had not wanted to name it; he had wanted her to under- stand and show no fear. She had not been able to accept the Stod- dard trial, she had run from the dread of seeing him hurt by the world,· but she had agreed to help him in this. Had . agreed in complete serenity. She was free and he knew it. The road ran flat across the dark stretches of Long Island, but -Dominique felt as if she were driving uphill. That was the only abnormal sensation: the sensation of rising, as if her cai were speeding vertically. She kept her eyes on the road; but the daSh- board on the rim of her vision looked like the panel of an air- plane. Th~ clock on the dashboard said 11:10. She was amused, thinking: I've never learned to fly a plane and now I know how it feels; just like this, the unobstructed space and no effort. And no weight. That's supposed to happen in the stratosphere--or is it the interplanetary space?-where one begins to float and there's no law of gravity. No law of any kind of gravity at all. She heard. herself laughing aloud. Just the sense of rising .... Otherwise, she felt normal. She had never driven a car so well. She thought: It's a dry, mechan- ical job, to drive a car, so I know I'm very clearheaded; because driving seemed easy, like breathing or swallowing, an immediate functidn reqUiring no attention.

When it gets to be ten inches, I'll start, thought Dominique. She stood by the side of her car and wished the watchman would walk faster. The building was a black mass that propped the sky in one spot. The rest of the sky sagged, intimately low over-a flat stretch of ground. The closest streets and houses were years away, far on the rim of space, irregular little dents, like the teeth of a broken saw. She felt a large pebble under the sole of her pump; it was un- comfortable, but she would not move her foot; it would make a sound. She was not alone. She knew that he was somewhere in that building, the width of a street away from her. There was no sound and no light in the building; only white crosses on black windows. He would need no light; he knew every hall, every stairwell. The watchman had shrunk away. She-jerked the door of her car open. She threw her hat and bag inside, and flung the door shut. She heard the slam of sound when she was across the road. running over the empty tract, away from the building. She felt the silk of her dress clinging to her legs, and it served as a tangible purpose of flight, to push against that, to tear past that barrier as fast as she could. There were pits and dry stubble on the ground. She fell once, but she noticed it only when she was running again. _ She saw the trench in the darkness. Then she was on her knees, at the bottom, and then stretched flat on her stomach, face down, her mouth pressed to the earth. She felt the pounding of her thighs and she twisted her body once in a long convulsion, to feel the earth with her legs, her breasts, the skin of her arms. It was like lying in Roark's bed. The sound was the crack of a fist on the back of her head. She felt the thrust of the earth against her, flinging her up to her feet, to the edge of the trench. The upper part of the Cortlandt build- ing had tilted and hung still while a broken streak of sky grew slowly across it. As if the sky were slicing the building in half. Then the streak became turquoise blue light.

In the flash when walls rose outward and a building opened like a sunburst, she thought of him there, somewhere beyond, the builder who had to destroy, who knew every crucial point of that structure, who had made the delicate balance of stress and sup- port; she thought of him selecting these key spots, placing the blast, a doctor turned murderer, expertly cracking heart, brain and lungs at once. He was there, he saw it and what it did to him was worse than what it did to the building. But he was there and he welcomed it. She saw the city enveloped in light for half a second, she could see window ledges and cornices miles away, she thought of dark rooms and ceilings licked by this fire, she· saw the peaks of towers lighted against the sky, her city now and his. \"Roark!\" she screamed. \"Roark!- Roark!\" She di(l not know she screamed. She could not hear her voice in the blilst. Then she was running across the field to the smoking ruin, running over broken glass, planting her feet down full with each step, because she enjoyed the pain. There was no pain left ever to be felt by her again. A spread of dust stood over the field like an awning. She heard the shriek of sirens starting far away. It was still a car, though the rear wheels were crushed under a piece of furnace machinery, and an elevator door lay over the hood. She crawled to the seat. She had to look as if she had not moved from here. She gathered handfuls of glass off the floor and poured it over her lap, over her hair. She took a sharp splin- ter and slashed the skin of her neck, her legs,· her arms. What she felt was not pain. She saw blood shooting out of her arm, run- ning down on her lap,. soaking the black silk, trickling between her thighs. Her head fell back, mouth open~ panting. She did not want to stop. She was free. She was invulnerable. She did not know she had cut an artery. She felt so light. She was laughing at the law of gravit}t. , When she was found by the men of the first police car to reach the scene, she was Qllconscious, a few minutes' worth of life left in her body. 13 DoMINIQUE glanced about the bedroom of the penthouse.

She had wanted to tell them all that she would, that she had no choice now but to live; only it did not seem important to tell people anything, ever. . Now she was back.

''It happens, upon rare occasions, that world forces too·great to comprehend become focused in a single event, like Tays gath- ered by a lens. to one point of superlative brightness, for all of us to see. Such an event is the outrage of Cortlandt. Here, in a microcosm, we can observe the evil that has crushed olir poor planet from the day of its birth in cosmic ooze. One man's Ego against all·the concepts of mercy, humanity and brotherhood. One man destroying the future home of the disinherited One man .condemning thousands to the horror of the slums_, to filth, disease and death. When an awakening society, with a new sense of humanitarian duty, made a mighty effort to rescue the under- privileged, when the best talents of society united to. create a decent home for them-the egotism of one man blew the achievement of others to pieces. And for .what? For some vague matter· of personal vanity, for some empty conceit. I regret that the laws of our state allow nothing more than a prison-sentence for this crime. That man should forfeit his life. Society needs the right to rid itself of men such as Howard Roark.\" Thus spoke Ellsworth M. Toohey in the pages of the New Frontiers. · Echoes answered him from all over the country. The explosion of Cortlandt had lasted. half a minute. The _explosion of public fury went on and on, with a cloud of powdered plaster filling the air, with rust and refuse raining out of the-cloud Roark had been indicted by a grand jury, had pleaded \"Not guilty\" and had refused to make any other statement. He had been released on a bond furnished by Gail Wynand,- and he awaited trial. There were many speculations on his motive. Some said' it was professional jealousy. Others declared that there was a certain similarity between the design of Cortlandt and Roark's style of building, that Keating, Prescott and Webb might have borrowed a little from Roark-\"a legitimate adaptation\"-\"there's no property rights on ideas\" -\"in a democracy, art belongs to all the people\"-and that Roark had been prompted by the vengeance lust of an artist who had believed himself plagiarized. None of it was too clear, but no~dy cared too much about the motive. The issue was simple: one man against many. He had no right to a motive. A home, built in charity, for the poor.

Against that-one man who wished neither to serve nor to rule. And had thereby committed the only unforgivable crime. It was a sensational scandal, and there was .the usual noise and the usual lust of righteous anger, such as is proper to all lynch- ings. But there was a fierce, personal quality in the indignation of every person who spoke about it \"He's just an egomaniac devoid of all moral sense·~- -said the society woman {iressing for a charity bazaar, who dared not contemplate what means of self-expression would be left to her and how she could impose her ostentation on her friends, if charity were not the all-excusing virtue-,. -said the social worker who had found no aim in life ·and could generate no aim from within the sterility of his soul, but basked in virtue and held an unearned respect from all, by grace of his fingers on the wounds of others- -said the novelist who had nothing to say if. the subject of service .and sacrifice were to be taken away from him, who sobbed in the hearing of attentive thousands that he loved them and loved them and would they please love him a little in return- -said the lady columnist who had just bought a country man- sion because .she wrote so tenderly about the little people- -said all the little people who wanted to hear of love, the great love, the unf8stidious love, the love that embraced every- thing, forgave everything and permitted them· everything- -said every second-bander who could not exist except as a leech on the souls of. others. Ellsworth Toohey sat back, watched, listened and smiled. Gordon L. Prescott and Gus Webb were entertained at dinners and cOcktail parties; they were treated with tender, curious solic- itude, like survivors of disaster. They said that they could not un- derstand what possible motive Roark could have had, and. they demanded justice. Peter Keating went nowhere. He refused to see the press. He refused to see anyone. But he issued a written statement that he believed Roark was not guilty. His statement contained one curi- ous sentence, tl!_e last It said: \"Leave him alone, please can !t you leave him alone?'' Pickets from the Council ·of American Builders paced in front of the Cord Building. It served no purpose, because there was no work in Roark's office.

''We have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that great- ness is to be gauged by self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate virtue. Let's stop and think for a moment. Is sacti- fice a virtue? Carta man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feel- ings? The independence-of his thought? But these are ·a man's su- preme• possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. They, however, are _above sacrific- ing to any cause or consideration whatsoever. Should we not, 623"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"then, stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense? Self- sacrifice? But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed. It is the unsacrificed self that we must respect in man above all.\" This editorial was quoted in the New Frontiers and in many newspapers,. reprinted in a box under the heading: \"Look who's talking!\" Gail Wynand laughed. Resistance fed him and made him stronger. This was a war, and he had not engaged in a real war for years, not since the time when he laid the foundations· of his empire amid cries of protest from the whole profession. He was granted the impossible, the dream of every man: the chance and intensity of youth, to be used with the wisdom of experience. A new beginning and a climax, together. I have waited and lived, he thought, for this. His twenty-two newspapers, his magazines, his newsreels were given the order: Defend Roark. Sell Roark to the public. Stem the lynching. ''Whatever the facts,\" Wynand explained to his staff, \"this is not going to be a trial by facts. It's a trial by public opinion. We've always made public opinion. Let's make it Sell Roark. I don't care how you do it. I've trained you. You're experts at sell- ing. Now show me how good you are.\" He \\Yas greeted by silence, and his employees glanced at one another. Alvah Scarret mopped his forehead. But they obeyed. The Banner printed a picture of the Enright House, with the caption: \"Is this the man you want to destroy?\" A picture of Wynand's home: ''Match this, if you can.\" A picture of Monad- nock Valley: \"Is this the man who has contributed nothing to so- ciety?\" The Banner ran Roark's biography, under the byline of a writer nobody had ever heard of; it was written by Gail Wynand. The Banner ran a series on famous trials in which innocent men had been convicted by the majority prejudice of the moment. The Banner ran articles on man martyred by society: Socrates, Galileo, Pasteur, the thinkers, the scientists, a long, heroic line-- each a man who stood. alone, the man who defied men. \"But, Gail, for God's sake, GaU, it was a housing project!\" wailed Alvah Scarret. · Wynand looked at him helplessly: \"I suppose it's impossible to make you fools understand that that has nothing to do with it. All right. We'll talk about housing projects.\" The Banner ran an expose on the housing racket: the graft, the incompetence, the structures erected at five times the cost a pri- vate builder would have needed, the settlements built and aban- doned, the horrible performance accepted, admired, forgiven, protected by the sacred cow of altruism. \"Hell is said to be paved with good intentions,\" said the Banner. \"Could it be because 624"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"we've never learned to distinguish what intentions constitute the good? Is it not time to learn? Never have there been so many good intentions so loudly proclaimed in the world. And .look at it\" The Banner editorials were written by Gail Wynand as he stood at a table in the composing room, written as always on a huge piece of print stock, with a blue pencil, in letters an inch high. He slammed the G W at the end, and the famous initials had never cairied such an air of reckless pride. Pominique had recovered and returned to their country house. Wynand drove home late in the evening. He brought Roark along as often as he could. They sat together in the living room, with the windows open to the spring night. The dark stretches of the hill rolled gently down to the lake from under the walls of the house, and the lake glittered through the trees far below. They did not talk of the case or of the coming trial. But Wynand .spoke of his crusade, impersonally, almost. as if it did not concern Roark at all. Wynand stood in the middle of the room, saying: '\"All right, it was contemptible-the whole career of the Ban- ner. But this· will vindicate everything. ·Dominique, I know you've never been able to understand why I've felt no shame in my past. Why I love the Banner. Now you'll See the ADSwer.:... Power.

Howard, by the time you come to trial. I'll have them all twisted in such a way there won't be a jury who'll dare convict you.'~ He,could not sleep. at night. He felt no desire to sleep. \"Go on to bed;\" he would say to Roark and [. .>minique, \"I'll come up in a few minutes.'' Then, Dominique .from the bedroom, Roark froni the guest room acros8 the hall, would bear Wynand's steps pac- ing the terrace· for ·hours, a kind of joyous restlessness in the sound, each step. like a sentence anchored, a statement pounded into the floor. Once, when Wynand dismisse4 them, late at night, Roark and Dominique went up the stairs together and stopped on the. first landing; they heard ·the . violent snap of a match in the liVing room below,_.a sound that carried the . picture of a hand jerked recklessly, lighting. the first ·of the cigarettes that would· last till dawn. a small dot of fire crossing and recrossing the terrace to the pounding of steps; . . They looked down the stairs and then looked at each other. \"It's horrible,\" said Dominique. · \"It's great,\" said Roark. · \"He can't help you,. no matter what be does.\" \"1 know he can't. That's not the point.'' \"He's risking everything he has to save you. He doesn't know he'll lose me if you're saved.'' · 625"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"\"Dominique, which will be worse for him-to lose you or to lose ·his crusade?'' She nodded, understanding. He added: \"You know that it's not me he wants to save. I'm only the excuse.\" She lifted her hand. She touched his cheekbone, a faint pres- sure of her fingertips. She could allow herself nothing else. She turned and went on to her bedroom, and heard him. closing the guest-room door. . \"Is it not appropriate,\" wrote Lancelot Clokey in a syndicated article, ''that Howard Roark is being defended by the Wynand papers? If anyone doubts the moral issues involved in this appall- ing case, here is the proof of what's what and who stands where. The Wynand papers-that stronghold of yellow journalism, vul- · garity, corruption and muckraking, that organized insult to public taste and decency, that intellectual underworld rbled by a man who has less conception of principles . than a cannibal-the - Wynand papers are the proper champions of Howard Roark, and Howard Roark is their rightful hero. After a lifetime devoted to blasting the integritY of the press, it is only fit that Gail Wynand should now support a cruder fellow dynamiter.\" \"All this fancy talk going 'round,\" said Gus Webb in a public speech, \"is a lot of bull. Here's the plain dope. That guy Wynand's salted away plenty, and I mean plenty, by skinning suckers in the real-estate racket all these years. Does he like ·it when the government muscles in and shoves him out, so's the lit- tle fellows can get a clean roof over their heads and a modem john for their kids? You bet your boots he don't like it, not one bit. It's a put-up job between the two of them, Wynand and that redheaded boy friend of his, and if you ask me the boy friend got a good hunk of cash out of Mr. Wynand for pulling the job.\" \"We have it from an unimpeachable source,\" wrote a radical newspaper, ''that Cortlandt was only the first step in a gigantic plot to blow up every housing project, every public power plant, post office and schoolhouse in the U.S.A. The conspiracy is headed by Gail Wynand-,-as we can see-and by other bloated capitalists of his kind, includipg some of out biggest money- b \" . ~oTho-little attention bas been paid to the feminine angle of this case,\" wrote Sally Brent in the New Frontiers ..

And that her husband is now raising the roof to defend Mr. Roark?· If we weren't blinded by a stupid, ·senseless, old- fashioned sense of gallantry where a so-called ~tiful woman is concerned; we wouldn't allow that part of the case to be bushed up.

Doctors can be bought, just like anybody else, and Mr. Gail Wynand is an expert in such matters. If we consider all this, we might well see the outlines of something that looks like a most revolting 'design for living.' \" ''The position taken by the Wynand press,\" wrote a quiet, con- servative newspaper, \"is inexplicable and disgraceful.\" The circulation of the Banner dropped week by week, the speed accelerating in the descent, like an elevator out of control. Stickers and buttons in.scribed ''We Don't Read Wynand\" grew on walls, subway posts, windshields and coat lapels. Wynand newsreels were booed off the theater screens. The Banner· van- ished from· comer newsstands; the news vendor& had· to carry it, but they hid it under their counters and produced it grudgingly, only upon request. The ground had been prepared, the pillars eaten through long· ago; the Cortlandt case provided the final im- pact. . . Roark was almost forgotten in the storm of indignation against Gail- Wynand. The angriest protests .came from Wynand's own public: from the Women's Clubs, the ministers, the mothers, ·the small shopkeepers. Alvah Scarret.had to be kept away fr9m the room where hampers of letters to the editor were being filled each day; he started by reading the letters--and his friends on the staff undertook to prevent a repetition of the experience, fearing a stroke. . . . . The staff of the Banner worked in silence. The(e were no Jur- tive glances, no whispered cuss words, no gossip itt washrooms any longer. A few men resigned. The rest worked on,. slowly, heavily, in the manner of men with life belts buckled, waiting for the inevitable. · _GaiJ Wynand noticed a kind of lingering tempo in every action around him. When he entered the Banner Building, his employ- ees stopped at sight of him; when he nodded to them, their greet- ing came-a second too late; when he walked on and turned, be found them staring after him. The \"Yes, Mr. Wynand,\" that had always answered his orders. without a moment's cut between the last syllable of his voice and the· first letter of the answer,.· now · came late, and the pause had a tangible shape, so that the answer sounded like a sentence not followed but preceded by a qu!'Stion mark. \\ \"One Small Voice\" ·kept silent about the.· Cortlandt case. Wynand had summoned Toohey to his office; the day after the explosion, and had said: \"Listen, you. Not a word in yow col- umn. Understand? What you do or yell outside is none of my business-for the time being. But if you yell too much, I'll take care of you when this is over.\" \"Yes, Mr. Wynand.\" ''As far as. your column is concerned, you're deaf, dumb and 627."},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":",- blind.

You're acting like a child. Like a green amateur. Pull yourself together, man.\" \"Shut up,\" said Wynand. - . \"Gail, you are . . . you were the greatest newspaperman on earth. Do I have to tell you the obvious? An unpopular cause is a dangerous business for anyone. For a popular newspaper-it's suicide.\"- · · \"If you don't shut your mouth, I'll send you packing and\" get myself another shyster.\" Wyrumd began to argue about _the case-with the prominent men he met at business luncheons and dinners. He had never ar- gued before on any subject; he had never pleaded. He had merely tossed final statements to respectful listeners. Now he found no listeners. He found no indifferent silence, half boredom, half re- sentment. The men who had gath~ every word he cared to drop about the stock market, relil estate, advertising, politics, had no interest in his opinion on art, greatness and abstract justice. He heard a few answers: · \"Yes, Gail, yes, sure. But on- the other hand, I think it was damn selfish of the man. And that's the trouble with the world today-selfishness. Too much selfishness everywhere. That's what Lancelot Clokey said in his book-swell book, all about his childhood, you read it; saw your pi~re with Clokey. Clokey's been all over the world, he knows what he's talking about.\" \"Yes, Gail, but aren't you kind of old-fashioned about it? What's all that great inan stuff?

One morning when Wynand stepped-out of his car in front of the BllllJler Building, a woman rushed up to him as he crossed the sidewalk. She had .been waiting by the entrance: She was fat and middle-aged. She wore a fllthy cotton dress and a crushed bat. She-bad a pasty, sagging face, a shapeless mouth and black, round, brilliant eyes. She stood before Girll Wynand and she flung a' bunch -of rotted beet leaves at his face. There were no beets, just the leaves, soft and slimy, tied with a string. They hii his cheek and rolled down to· the sidewalk. · Wynand stood still. He-looked at the woman. He saw the white flesh, the mouth hanging open in triumphs, the face of self- righteous evil. Passers-by had seized the woman and she was screaming unspeakable obscenities. Wynand raised his hand, shook his head, gesturing for them to let the creature go, and walked ~to the Banner Building, a smear of greenish-yellow across liis cheek. _ \"Ellsworth, what are we going to do?'' moaned Alvah Sc~t. ''What are we going to do?'' · Ellsworth Toohey sat perched on the edge of his desk, and smiled as if he wished he could kiss Alvah Scarret. - \"Why don't they drop the damn thing; Ellsworth?

If youlearn how to rule one single man's soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It's the soul, Peter, the soul. Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That's. why the Caesars, the Attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. The soul, Peter, is that which can't be ruled. It must be broken.

There are many ways. l!ere's one. Make man feel small. Make 4im f!!el guilty. Kill his aspiration and his'integrity. That's difficult. The wors~ among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way. Killin- tegrity by internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct_ it to- • ward a goal destructive of all integrity .. Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live for others. Tell men that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a single one .ever will. His every living instinct screams against it. But don't you see what you accomplish? Man realizes that he's incapable of what he's accepted as the noblest virtue-and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, o' his own basic unworthiness. Since the supre_me ideal is beyond his grasp, he gives up even- tually all ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. lie feels himself obliged to preach what he can't practice. But one can't be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve one's integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be cbmipt already?-His soul gives up its self-respect You've got him. He'll obey. He'll be glad to obey-because he can't trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. That's one way. Here's another. Kill man's sense of v!llues. Kill his ca- pacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it Great men can't be ruled. We don't want any great men. Don't deny the conception of greatness. Destrqy it from within, The great is the rare, the dif- ficult, the exceptional, Set up standards of-achievement open to all, to the least, to.the most inept-and you stop the impetus ~o effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive to im- provement, to excellence, to perfection. Laugh at Roark and hold Peter Keating as a great architect. You've destroyed architecture.

Don't set out to raze all shrines-you'll frighten men. Enshrine mediocrity-and the shrines are razed. Then there's another way. Kill by laughter. Laughter is an instru- ment of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into a sneer. It's simple. Tell .them to laugh at everything. Tell them that a sense of humor is an unlimited virtue. Don't let anything remain sacred in a man's soul-and his soul won't be sacred to him. Kill reverence and you've killed the hero in man. One doesn't reverence with a giggle. He'll obey and he'll set no limits to his obedience-anything goes-nothing is tQO serious. Here's another way. This is most important Don't allow men to be happy. Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. Happy meil have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living. Take away from them whatever is dear or important to them. Never let them have what they want. Make them feel that the mere fact of a personal desire is evil. Bring them to a state where saying 'I want' is no longer a natural right, but a shameful admission. Altruism is of great help in this. Un- happy men will come to you. They'll need you. They'll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows ilo vacuum. Empty man's soul......:.and the space is yours to fill. I don't see why . you should look so shocked, Peter. This iS the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great system. of ethics, from the . Orient up. Didn't they all preach the sacrifice of personal joy? Under all the complications of verbiage, haven't they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? Haven't you been able to catch their theme song- 'Give up, give up, give up, give up'? Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything en- joyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy-and you've damned it. That's how far we've come . . We've tied happiness to guilt And we've got mankind by. the throat. Throw your first-born into a sacrificiru furnace-lie on a bed of nails-go into the desert to mortify the flesh-don't dance-don't go to the movies on Sunday-don't try to get rich-don't smok~on't drink. It's all the same lfue. The great line. Fools think that taboos of this .nature ·are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned. But there's always a purpose in nonsense.

You must telf people that they'll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don't have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words.

Falk's brother w~s secretary to Lancelot Clokey. · Gail Wynand sat at the desk in his office and looked down at a pile of paper. He had many things to do, but one picture kept coming back to him and he could not get rid of it and the senSe of it clung to_all his actions-the picture of a ragged boy stand- ing before the desk of an editor: \"Can you spell cat?\"-''Can you . spell anthropomorphology?\" The identities cracked and became mixed, it seemed to him that the boy stood here, at his desk, waiting, and once he said aloud: \"Go away!\" He caught himself in anger, he thought: You're cracking, you fool, now's not the time. He did not speak aloud again, butthe eonversation went on silently while he read, checked and signed papers: \"Go away! We have no jobs here.\" I'll hang around. Use me when you want to. You don't have to pay me.\" \"They're paying you, don't you un- 645"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"deiStand, you little fool? They're paying you!' Aloud, his voice normal, he said into a telephone: \"Tell Manning that we'll _have to fill in with mat stuff .... Send up the proofs as soon as you can .... Send up a sandwich. Any kind.\" A few bad remained with him: the old men and the copy boys. They came·in, in the morning, often with cuts on their faces and blood on. their collars; one stumbled in, his skull open, and bad to be sent away in an ambulance. It was neither courage nor loy- alty; it was inertia; they had lived too long with the thought that the world would end if they lost their jobs on the Banner. The· old ones did not undeiStand. The young ones. did not care. Copy boys were sent out on reporter's beats. Most of the stuff they sent in was· of such quality that Wynand was forced past de- spair into howls of laughter: he bad never read such highbrow. English; be \"ould see the J>rlde of the ambitious youth who was a journalist at last. He did not laugh when _the stories appeared in the Banner as written; there were not enough rewrite men. He tried to hire new men. He offered extravagant salaries. The people be wanted. refused. to wgrk for him. A few men answered his call, and he wished they hadn't, though he hired them. They were men who bad not been emplQyed by a reputable newspaper for ten yem; the kind who would not have been allowed, a month ago, into the lobby of his building. Some of them bad to be thrown out in two days; otheiS remained. They were drunk most of the time. Some acted as if they were granting Wynand a .favor. \"Don't you get huffy, Gail, old boy,\" said one-and was tossed bOdily down two fJights of stairs. He broke an ankle and sat on the bottom landing, looking up at Wynand with an air of complete asto~hment. OtheiS were subtler; they merely stalked about and looked at Wynand slyly, almost winking, implying that they were fellow criminals tied together in a dirty deal• He appealed to schools of jo~m. No one responded. One student body .sent him_ a resolution signed by all its membeiS: \" ... Entering o.ur careeiS with a high regard for the dignity of our profession, dedicating ourselves to uphold the honor of the press, we feel that none among us could preserve his self-respect and accept an offer such as _yoUIS.\" . . .. · 'fhe_news editor bad re~ned at his desk; the city editor bad gone. Wynand filled in as city editor, managing editor, wire man, rewrite man, copy boy. He did not leave the building. He slept on a couch in his office-as be bad done in•tbe first yeaiS of the Banner's existence. Coatless, tieless, his shirt collar tom open, he ran up and down the stairs, his steps ~ike the rattle of a machine gun. 1\\vo elevator boys had remained; the others ~ vanished, no one knew-just when or why, whether promPted by sympathy for the strike, fear or plain discouragement.

Gail Wynand stood at a desk in the city room and wrote edi- torials as usual. His derelict staff saw no change in him; no haste, no outbursts of anger. There was riobody to notice that some of his. actions were new: he would go to the pressroom and stand 648"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"looking at the white stream shot out of the roaring giants, and lis- ten to the sound. He would pick up a lead slug off the composing room floor, and finger it absently on the palm of his hand, like a piece of jade, and lay it carefully on a table; as if he did not want it to be wasted. He fought other forms of such waste, not noticing it, the gestures instinctive: .he retrieved pencils, he spent a half-hour, while telephones shrieked unanswered, repairing a typewriter that had broken down. It was not a matter of econ- omy; he signed' checks withoui looking_ at the figures; Scarret was afraid to think of the amounts each passing day cost him. It was a matter of things· that were .part of the building where he loved every doorknob, things that belonged to. the Banner that . belonged to him. Late· each afternoon he telephoned Dominique iD the country. \"Fine; ··Everything under control. Don't listen to panic- mongers ....

The thought of the countryside was like the thought of a continent be- yond an ocean that could not be crossed; it gave Dim a sense of . being locked in a besieged fortress and he liked that-not the fact, but the feeling. His face looked like a throwback to sonie distant ancestor who bad fought on the ramparts of a castle. One evening he went out to the restaurant across the street; be bad not eaten a complete meal for days. The· streets were still light when be came back-the placid brown haze of summer, as if dulled· sunrays remained· stretched too comfortably on the warm air to undeJtake a movement of withdrawal, even though the sun had long since gone; it made the sky look fresh and the street dirty; there wen: patches of brown. ancJ tired orange in the comers of old buildings; He saw pickets pacing in front of the Banner's entrance. There were eight of them and they marched around and around in a long oval on the sidewalk. He recognized one boy-a police re- porter, he bad never seen any of the others. They carried signs: ''Toohey, Harding, Allen, Falk ... \" ''The Freedom of the Press ... \" ''Gail Wynand Tramples Human Rights ... \" His eyes kept following one woman. Her hips began at her an- kles, bulging over the tight straps of her shoes; she bad square 649"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"shoulders and a long coat of cheap brown tweed over a huge square body. She had small white hands, the kind that would drop things all over the kitchen. She had an incision of a mouth, without lips, and ·she waddled as she moved, but she moved with surprising briskness. Her steps defied the whole world to hurt her, with a malicious slyness that seemed to say she would like nothing better, because what a joke it wo_uld be on the world if it tried to hurt.her, just try it and see, just try it. Wynand knew she had never been employed on the Banner; she never could be; it did not appear likely that she could be taught to read; her steps seemed to add that she jolly well didn't· have to. She carried a sign: \"We demarid .... \" He thought of the nights when he had slept on the couch in the · old Banner Building, in the first years, because the new presses had to be paid for and the Banner had to be on the streets before its competitors, and he coughed blood one night and refused to see a doctor, but it turned out to be nothing, just exhaustion. He hurried into the building. The presses were rolling. He stood and listened for a while. At night the building was quiet. It seemed bigger, as if sound took space and vacated it; there were panels of light at open doors, between long stretches of dim hallways. A lone typewriter clicked somewhere, evenly, like a dripping faucet. Wynand walked through the halls. He thought that men had been willing to work for him when he plugged known crooks for municipal elections, when he glamorized red-light districts, when he ruined reputations by scandalous libel, when he sobbed over the mothers of gangsters. Talented men, respected men had been eager to . work for him. Now he was being honest for the first time in his career. He was leading his greatest crusade-with the help of finks, drifters, drunkards, and humble drudges too passive to quit. The guilt, he- thought, was not perhaps with those who now re- fused to work for him. The sun hit· the square crystal inkstand on his desk. It made Wynand think of a cool drink on a lawn, white clothes, the feel of grass under bare elbows. He tried not to look at the gay glitter and went on writing. It was a morning in the second week of the strike. He had retreated to his office for an hour and given orders not to be disturbed; he had an article to finish; he knew he wanted the excuse, one hour of not seeing what went on in the building. The door of his office opened without announcement, and Dominique came in. She had not been allowed to enter the Ban._ ner Building since their marriage. He got up, a kind of quiet obedience in his move1_11ent, permit- ting himself no questions. She wore a coral linen suit, she stood 650"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"as if the lake were behind her and the sunlight rose from the sur- face to the folds ~f her clothes.

If you want to stay, you're not to step out Qf the building,\" This was his only comment on her pfeS~!nce. He spoke to her when necessary, briefly and sit:nply, as to any other employee.

They did not speculate on the future. They felt relief in forgetting the question beyond the walls of the build- ing; it could be forgotten because it stood no longer as a question between them; it was solved and answered; what remained· was the peace of the simplified: they had a job to do-the job· of keeping a newspaper going-and they. were doing it together. She would come in, unsummoned, in the middle of the night, . with a cup of hot coffee, and he would snatch it gratefully, not pausing in his work. He would find fresh sandwiches left ·on his desk when he needed them badly. He had no time to wonder where she got things. Then he discovered that she had estab- lished an electric plate and a stock of supplies in a closet. She cooked breakfast for him, when he had to work all night, she came in carrying dishes on a piece of cardboard for a tray, with the silence of empty streets beyond the windows and the first light of morning on the rooftops. Once he found her, broom in hand, sweeping ·an office; the maintenance department had fallen apart, ·charwomen appeared and disappeared, no one _had ·time· to . notice. \"Is that what I'm paying you for?\" he asked. ''Well, we can't work in a pigsty. I haven't asked you what you're paying me, but. I want a raise.\" · \"Drop this thing, for God's sake! It's ridiculous.\" ''What's ridiculous? It's clean now.

He learned that her endurance was greater than his. She never showed a sign of exhaustion. He supposed that she slept; but he could not discover when. . At any time, in any part of the building; not seeing him for hours, she was aware of him, she Jmew ·when he needed her most. Once, he fell asleep, slumped across his desk. He awak- ened and found her looking at him. She had turned off the lights, she sat on a chair by the window, in the moonlight, her face turned to him, calm, watching. Her face was the first thing he saw. Lifting his head painfully from his arm, in the first mQment, before he could return fully to control and reality, he felt a sud- den wrench of anger, helplessness and desperate protest, not re- membering what had brought them here, to this, remembering 652"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"only that they were both caught in some vast, slow· process of torture and that he loved her. She had seen it in his face, before he had completed the move- ment of straightening his body. She walked to him, she stood by hi~ chair, she took his head and let it rest against her, she held him, and he did not resist, slumped in her arms, she kissed his hair, she whispered: \"It will be all right, Gail, it will be all right.\" At the end of three weeks Wynand waiked out of the building one evening, not caring whether there would be anything left of it when he returned, and went to see Roark. , He had not telephoned Roark since the beginning of the siege. Roark telephoned him often; Wynand answefred, quietly,just an- swering, originating·no statement, refusing to prolong the conver- sation, He had wm:necJ· Roark at the beginning: \"Don't try: to come here.

But don't give in.\" He turned away, and added: ''That's all. We won't talk about your damn strike again. Sit down, I'll get you a drink.

Dominique said, \"You've seen Roark.\" \"Yes. How do you know?\" \"Here's the Sunday makeup. It's fairly lousy, but it'll have to do. I sent Manning home for a few hours-he was going to col- lapse.

I'm good for hours.\" They went on, and the. days passed, and in the mailing room the piles of returns grew, running over into the corridor, white stacks of paper like marble slabs. Fewer copies of the Banner were run off with every edition, but the stacks kept growing. The days passed, days of heroic effort to put out a newspaper that came back unbought and unread. 16 IN THE glass-smooth mahogany of the long table reserved for the board of directors there was a monogram in cotored wood--G W-reproduced from his signature.

It was the first meeting in the board'shistory that had not been summoned by Wynand. But the meeting had convened and Wynand had come. The strike was in its second month. Wynand stood by his chair at the head of the table. He looked like a drawing from a men's magazine, fastidiously groomed, a white handkerchief in the breast pocket of hls dark suit. The di- rectors caught themselves in peculiar thoughts: some thought of British tailors, others-of the House of Lords-of the Tower of London-of the executed English King-or · was it a Chancellor?-who had died so well. They did not want to look at the man before them. They leaned upon visions of the pickets outside-of the perfumed, · manicured women wl\\o shrieked their support of Ellsworth Toohey -in drawing-room discussions-of the broad, flat face of a girl who paced Fifth Avenue with a placard ''We Don't -Read Wynand\",-for support and courage to say what they were say- ing. .

Honest, Wynand, I've tried to read your editorials and if you want my honest opinion, it's the lousiest stuff ever put in print. You'd think you were writing for college professors!\" Wynand thought: I know you-you're the one who'd give money to a pregnant slut, but n~,>t to a starving genius-I've seen your face before--I picked you and I brought you in-when in doubt about your work, remember that man's face, you're writing for him-but, Mr. Wynand, one can't remember his face-one .can, child, one can, it· will come back to remind you-it will come back and demand payment-and I'll pay-I signed a blank check long ago and now it'~ presented for collection-but a blank check is always made out to the sum of everything you've got. . ''The situation is medieval and a. disgrace to democracy.\" The voice whined. It was Mitchell Layton speaking. \"It's about time somebody had some say around here. One man running- all those papers as he damn pleases-what is this, the nineteenth cen- tury?\" Layton pouted; he looked somewhere in the direction of a banker across the table. \"Has anybody here ever bothered to in- quire about my ideas? I've ·got ideas. We've all got to pool ideas. What I mean is teamwork, one big orchestra. It's about time this paper had a modem, .liberal, progressive policy!

Scarret had drops of sweat running down his temples; he didn't know why; he wanted the board to win; there was just something in the room . . . it's too hot in here, he thought, I wish somebody'd open a window. \"I won't shut up!\" shrieked Mitchell Layton. \"I'm just as good as ... \"' \"Please, Mr. Layton,\" said the banker. 656"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"\"All right,\" said Layton, \"all right.

You had-better give in.\" Wynand heard that. He had heard it through all the speeches. He had heard it for days before the meeting. He knew it better .than any man present. Close the Banner. He saw a single picture: the new masthead rising over the door of the Gazette. \"You had better give in.\" He made a step back. It was not a wall behind him. It wa.s only the side of his chair. - He thought of the moment in his bedroom when he had almost pulled a trigger. He knew he was pulling it now. \"All right,\" he said. It's only a bottle cap, thought Wynand looking down at a speck of glitter under his feet; a bottle cap ground into the pave- ment. The pavements of New York are full of things like that- bottle caps, safety >pins, campaign buttons, sink chains; sometimes-lost jewels; it's all alike now, flattened, ground in; it makes the· pavements- sparkle at night. The fertilizer of a city. Someone drank the bottle empty and threw the cap away. How many cars have passed over it?. Could one retrieve it now?. Could one kneel and dig with bare hands and tear it out again? I had no right to hope for escape. I had no right to kneel and seek redemp- tion. Millions of years ago, when the earth was being born, there were living· things like me: flies caught in resin that became am- ber,. animals caught in· ooze that became rock. I t>m a man of the twentieth century and I became a bit of tin in the pavements, for the trucks of New York to roll over. - · He walked slpwly, the collar of his topcoat raised. The street stretched before him, empty, and the buildings ahead were like the backs of books lining a shelf, assembled without order, of all sizes. The comers he passed led to black channels; street lamps gave the eity a protective cover, but it cracked in spots. He turned a comer when he saw a slant of light ahead; it was a go!ll for three or foul' blocks. The light came from the window of a: pawnshop. The shop was closed, but a glaring buib hung there to discourage looters_ who might be reduced to this. He stopped and looked at it. He thought, the most indecent sight on earth, a pawnshop window. The things which had been sacred to men, and the things which had been precious, surrendered to the sight of all, to the pawing and _the bargaining, trash to the indifferent eyes of strangers, the equality of a junk heap, typewriters and violins-the tools of 658"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"dreams, old photographs and wedding rings-the tags of love, to- gether with soiled trousers, coffee pots, ash trays, pornographic plaster. figures; the refuse of despair, pledged, not sold,· not cut off in clean finality, but hocked to a stillborn hope, never to be redeemed. \"Hello, Gail Wynand,\" he said to the things in the window, and walked on. He felt an iron grate under his feet and an odor struck him in the face, an odor of dust, sweat and dirty clothing, worse than the smell of stockyards, because it had a homey, normal quality, like decomposition. made routine. The grating of a subway. He · thought, this is the residue of many people put together, of hu- man bodies pressed into a mass, with no space to move, with no air to breathe. This is the sum, even though down there, among the pack;ed flesh, one can find the smell of starched white dresses, of clean hair, of healthy young skin. Such is the nature of sums and of quests for the low.est common denominator. What, then, is the.residue of many human minds put together, un- aired, unsAACed, undifferentiated? The Banner; he thought, and walked.on. My city, he thought, the city lloved, the city I thought I ruled. He had walked out of the board meeting, he had said: ''Take over, Alvah, until I come back.\" He had not stopped to see Man- ning drunk with exhau!'tion at the city desk, nor the people in the city room, still functioning, waiting, knowing what was being de- cided in the board room; nor Dominique. Scarret would tell them. He had walked out of the building and gone to his pent- house and sat alone in the bedroom without windows. Nobody had come to disturb him. When he left the penthouse, it was safe to go out it was dark. He passed a newsstand and saw late editions of the afternoon pa- pers announcing the settlement of the Wynand strike. The Union had accepted Scarret's compromise. He. knew that Scarret would take care of. all the rest.· Scarret would replate the front page of tomorrow's Banner. Scarret would write the editorial that would appear on the front page. He thought, the presses are rolling right now. Tomorrow morning's Banner will be out on the streets in an hour. He walked at random. He owned nothing, but he was owned by any part of the city. It was. right that the city should now di- rect his way and that he should be moved by the pull of chance comers. Here I am, my masters, I am coming to salute you and acknowledge, wherever you want me, I shall go as I'm told. I'm the man who wanted power. That woman sitting on the stoop of an old brownstone house, her fat white knees spread apart-the nian pushing the white bro- cade of his stomach out of a cab in front of a great hotel-the lit- tle man sipping root beer at a drugstore counter-the woman leaning over a stained mattress on the sill of a tenement 659"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"window-the taxi driver parked on a corner-the lady With or- chids, .drunk at the table of a sidewalk cafe-the toothless woman selling chewing gum-the man in shirt sleeves, leaning against the door of a poolroom-they are my masters.

But behind each yellow rectangle that climbs, one over another, to the sky-under each bulb--down to there, see that spark over the river which is not a star?-there are people whom you will never see and who are your masters. At the supper tables, in the drawing rooms, in their beds and in their · cellars, in their studies and in their bathrooms. Speeding in the subways under your feet. Crawling up in elevators through verti- cal cracks around you. Jolting past you in every bus. Your mas- ters, Gail Wynand. There is a net-longer than the cables that coil through the walls of this city, larger than the mesh of pipes that carry water, gas and refuse-there is another hidden net around you; it is strapped to you, and the wires lead to every hand in tlle city. They jerked the wires and you moved. You .were a ruler of men: You held a leash. A leash is only a rope with a noose at both ends. My masters, the anonymous, the unselected. They gave me a penthouse, an office, a yacht. To them, to any one of them who wished. for the sum of three cents, I sold Howard Roark. He walked past an open marble court, a cave cut deep into a building, filled with light, spurting the sudden cold of air- conditioning. It was a movie theater and the marquee had letters made of rainbows: Romeo and Juliet. A placard stood by the glass column of the box office: \"Bill Shakespeare's immortal classic! But there's nothing highbrow about it! Just a simple hu- man love story. A boy from the Bronx meets a girl from Brook- lyn. Just like the folks next door. Just like you and me.\" He walked past the door of a saloon. There was a smell of stale beer. A woman sat slumped, breasts flattened against the ta- ble top. A juke box played Wagner's \"Song to the Evening Star,\" adapted, in swing time. · He saw the trees of Central Park. He walked, his eyes lowered. He was passing by the Aquitania Hotel. He came to a corner. He had escaped other corners like it, but this one caught him. It was a dim corner, ·a slice of sidewalk trapped between the wall of a closed garage and the pillars of an elevated station. He saw the rear end of a truck disappearing down the street. He had not seen the name on it, but he knew what truck it was. A newsstand crouched under the iron stairs of the elevated. He moved his eyes slowly. The fresh pile was there, spread out for him. Tomorrow's Banner. . He did not come closer. He stood, waiting. He thought, I still have a few minutes in which not to know. 660"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"He saw faceless people stopping at the stand, one after another. They came for different papers, but they bought the Banner also, when they noticed its front page. He stood pressed to the . wall, waiting. He thought, it is right that I should ~ the last to learn what I have said. Then he could delay no longer: no customers came, the stand stood deserted, papers spread in the yellow light of a bulb, wait- ing for him. He could see no vendor in the black hovel beyond the bulb. ·The 'street was empty. A long corridor filled by the skeleton of the elevated. Stone paving, blotched walls, the inter- lacing of iron pillars .. There were lighted windows, but .they looked as if no people moved inside the walls. A train thundered over his head, a long roll of clangor that went shuddering down the pillars into the earth. It looked like an aggregation of metal rushing without human driver through the night. He waited for the sound to die, then he walked to the stand. ''The Banner,\" he ~d. He did not see who sold him the paper, whether it was a man or a woman. He saw only a gnarled brown hand pushing the copy forward. He started walking away, but stopped while crossing the street. There was a picture of Roark on the front page. It was a good picture. The calm face, the sharp cheekbones, the implacable mouth. He read the editorial, leaning against a pillar of the ele- vated. . \"We have always endeavored to give our readers the truth without fear or prejudice ... \" ... charitable consideration and the benefit of the doubt evet\\ to a man charged with an outrageous crime ... \" ... but after conscientious investigation and in the light of new evidence placed before us, we fmd ourselves obliged hon- estly to admit that we might have been too lenient ... \" ...

If found guilty, as seems inevitable, Howard-Roark must be made to bear the fullest penalty the law can impose on him.\" It was signed \"Gail Wynand.\" When he looked up, he was in a brightly lighted street; on a trim sidewalk, looking at a wax figure exquisitely contorted on a satin chaise longue in a shop window; the figure wore a salmon- colored negligee, lucite san(ials and a string of pearls suspended from one raised finger. · He did not know when he had dropped the paper.

I wrote it one night when I was sixteen and stood on the roof of a tenement. He walked on. Another street lay before him, a sudden cut of long emptiness and a chain of green traffic lights strung out to the horizon. Like a rosary without end. He thought, now walk from green bead to green bead. He thought, these are not the words; but the words kept ringing with his steps: Mea culpa- mea t;:ulpa-mea maxima culpa. · He went past a window of old sftoes corroded by wear-past the door of a mission with a cross· above it-past the peeling poster of a political candidate who ran two years ago-past a grocery store with barrels of rotting greens on the sidewalk. The streets were contracting, Walls drawing closer together. He could smell the Odor of the river, and there were wads of fog over the rare lights. He was in Hell's Kitchen. The f~es of the buildings around him were like the walls of secret backyards suddenly exposed: decay without reticence, pasr the need of privacy or shame. He heard shrieks coming from a saloon on a corner; he could not tell whether it was joy or brawl- ing. He stood in the middle of a street. He looked slowly down the 'mouth of every dark crevice, up the streaked walls, to the win- dows, to the roofs. I never got out of here. I never got out. I surrendered to the grocery man--to the deck hands on the ferryboat-to the· owner of the poolroom. You don't run things around here. You don't run things around here. You've - never run things anywhere, Gail Wynand. You've only added yourself to the things they ran. Then· he looked up, act:oss the city, t<> the shapes of the great skyscrapers. He saw a string of lights rising unsupported in black space, a glowing pinnacle anchored to nothing, a !!mall, brilliant square hanging detached in the sky. He knew the famous build- ings to which these belonged, he could reconstruct their forins in space. He thought, you're my judges and witnesses. You rise, un- hindered, above the sagging roofs. Yori shoot your gracious ten- sion to the stars, out of the slack, the tired, the accidental. The eyes one. mile out on the ocean will see none of this and none of this will matter, but you will be the presence and the city.

You have seen all my steps and all my years. It's you that I've betrayed. For I was born to be one of you. He walked on. It was late. Circles of light lay undisturbed on the empty sidewalks under the lampposts. The horns of taxis shrieked once in a while like doorbells ringing through the corri- dors of·a vacant interior. He saw discarded newspapers, as he passed: on the pavements, on park benches, in the wire trash- baskets on corners. Many of them were the Banner. Many copies of the Banner had been read in the city tonight. He thought, we're building circulation, Alvah. He stopped. He saw a paper spread out in the gutter before him, front page up. It was the Banner; He saw Roark's picture. He saw the gray print of a rubber heel across Roark's face. He bent, his body folding itself down slowly, with both knees, both arms, and picked up the paper. He folded the front page and · put it in his pocket. He walked on. An unknown rubber heel, somewhere in the city, on an un- known foot that I released to march. I released them alL I made every one of those who destroyed me. There is a beast on earth, dammed safely by its own impo- tence. I broke the dam. They would have remained helpless. They can produce nothing. I gave them the weapon. I gave tliem my strength, my energy, my living power. I created a great voice and let them dictate the words. The woman who threw the beet leaves in my face had a right to do it. I made it possible for her. Anything may be betrayed, anyone may be forgiven. But not those who lack the courage· of the r own greatness. Alvah Scarret can be forgiven. He had nothing to J>etray. Mitchell Layton can be forgiven. But not I. I was not born to_be a second-bander. 17 IT WAS a summer day, cloudless and cool, as if.the sun were screened by an invisible film of water, and the energy of heat had been transformed into a sharper clarity, an added brilliance of outline for the buildings of the city. In the streets, scattered like scraps of gray foam; there were a great many copies of ~e Ban- ner. The city read, chuckling, the statement of Wynand's renun- ciation. · \"That's that,\" said Gus Webb, chairman of the \"We Don't Read Wynand\" Committee. \"It's slick,\" said Ike. \"I'd like one peek, just one peek, at the· great Mr. Gail Wynand's face today,\" said Shlry Brent. \"It's about time;\" said HomerSlottern. \"Isn't it splendid? Wynand's surrendered,\" said a tight-lipped woman; she knew little about Wynand and nothing about the issue, but she 663'"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"liked to hear of people surrendering. In a kitchen, after dinner, a fat woman scraped the remnants off the dishes onto. a sheet of newspaper; she. never read the front page, only the installments of a love. serial in the second section; she wrapped onion peelings and lamlrchop bones in a copy of the Banner. \"It's stupendous,\" said Lancelot Clokey, \"only I'm really sore at that Union, Ellsworth. How could they double-cross you like that?\" \"Don't be a sap, Lance,\" said Ellsworth Toohey. \"What do you mean?\" \"I told them to accept the terms.\" \"You did?\" \"Yep.\" \"But .Jesust 'One.

The butler opened the door and said: \"Mr. Wynand cannot see you, Mr. Roark.\" From the sidewalk across the street Roark looked up and saw a square of light high over the roofs, in the window of Wynand's study. . In the morning Roark came to Wynand's office in the Bannei: Building. Wynand's secretary told him: \"Mr. Wynand cannot see you, Mr; Roark.\" She added, her voice polite, disciplined: \"Mr. Wynand· has asked me to tell you that he does not wish ever to see you again.\" Roark wrote him a loJ;tg letter:\" ... Gail, I know. I hoped you could escape it, but since it had to happen, start again from where you are. I know what you're doing to yourself. You're not doing it for mY sake, it's not up to me, but if_ this will help you I want- to say that I'm repeating, now, everything I've ever said to you. Nothing has changed for ine. You're still what you were. I'm not saying that I forgive you, because there can be no such question between us. But if you can't forgive yourself, will you let me do it? Let me say that it doesn't matter, .it's not the final verdict on you. Give me the right to let you forget it. Go on just on my faith until you've recovered.

Do it ·for my sake, if that will · help you. But do it. Come back. There will be another chance. What you think you've lost can neither be lost nor. found. Don't let it go.\" , The letter came back to Roark, unopened. Alvah$carret ran the Banner. Wynand sat in his office. He had removed Roark's picture from the wall. He attended to advertis- ing contracts, expenses, accounts. Scarret took care of the edito- rial policy. Wynand did not read the contents of the Banner. When Wynand appeared in any department of the building, the employees obeyed him as. they had obeyed him before. He was 664"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"still a machine and they knew that it was a machine more danger- ous than ever: a car running downhill, without combustion or brakes. He slept in hi.s penthouse. He had not seen Dominique. Scarret had told him that she had gone back to the country. Once Wynand ordered his secretary to telephone Connecticut. He stood by bet desk while she asked the butler whether Mrs. Wynand was there. The butler answered th11t she was. The secretary hung up and Wynand went back to his office. He thought he would give himself a few days. Then he'd re- turn to Dominique. Their marriage would be what she had wanted it to be at frrst-\"Mrs. Wynand-Papers.\" He would ac- cept it. Wait, he thought in an agony of impatience, wait. You must learn to face her as you are now. Train yourself to be a beggar. There must be no pretense at things to which you have no right. No equality, no resistance, no pride in holding your strength against hers. Only acceptance now. Stand before her as a man who can giv~ her nothing, who will live on what she chooses to grant him. It will be contempt, but it Will come from her and it will be a bond. Show her that you recognize this. There is a lcind of dignity in a renunciation of dignity openly admitted.· Learn it. Wait ... He sat·in the ~tudy of his pen~ouse, his head on the arm of his chair. There were no witnesses in the empty rooms around hiin .... Dominique, he thought, I will have no claim to make except that I need you so much. And that I love you. I told you once not to consider it. Now I'll use it as a tin cup. But I'll use it. I love you. . . . · . Dominique lay stretchetl out on the shore of the lake. She looked at the house on the hill, at the tree branches above her .. Flat on her back; hands crossed under .her head, she studied the motion of leaves against the sky. It was an earnest occupation, gi~g her full contentment. She thought, it's a lovely kind of green, there's a difference· between the color of plants and the color of objects, this has light in it, this is not just green, but also the living force of the tree made visible, I don't have to look down, I can see the branches, the trunk, the rootS just by looking at that color. That frre around- the edges is the sun, I don't have to see it, I can tell what the whole countryside looks like today. The spots of light weaving in circles-that's the lake, the special kind of light that comes refracted from water, the lake is beauti- ful today, and it's better not to see it, just to guess by these spots. I have never been able to enjoy it before, the sight of the earth, it's such great background, but it has no meaning except as a background, and I thought of those who owned it and then it hurt me too much. I can love it now. They don't own it. They own nothing. They've never won. I have seen the life of Gail Wynand, and now I know. One cannot hate the earth in their 665"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"name. The earth is beautiful. And it is a background, but not theirs. . She knew what she had to do. But she would give herself a few days. She thought, I've learned to bear anything except hap- piness. I must learn how to carry it. How not to break under it. It's the only .discipline I'll need from now on. Roark stood at the window of his house in Monadnock Valley. He had rented the house for- the summer; he .went there when he wanted loneliness and rest. It was a quiet evening. The window opened on a small ledge in a frame of trees, hanging against_ the sky. A strip of sunset light stretched above the dark treetops. He knew that there we~ houses below, but they could not be seen. He was as grateful as any other tenant for the way in which he had built this place. . . He heard the sound of a car approaching up the road at the other side. He listened, astonished. He expected no guests. The car stopped. He walked to open the·door. He felt no astonishment when he saw Dominique. She came in as if she had left this house half an hour ago. She wore no hat, no stockings, just sandals and a dress intended for back country roads, a narrow sheath of dark blue linen with short sleeves, like a smock for gardening. She did not look as if she bad driven across three· states, but as if she were returning from a walk down the hill. He knew that this was to be the solemnity of the moment-that it needed no solemnity; it was not to be stressed and set apart, it was not this particular evening, .but the completed meaning· of seven years behind them. \"Howard.\" · He stood as if be were looking at the sound of his name in the · room. He had all he bad wanted. - • But there was one thought that remained as pain, even now. He said: · · \"Dominique, wait till he recovers.\" \"You know be won't recover.\" \"Have a little pity on bjm.\" \"Don't speak their language.\" . \"He had no choice.\" \"He could have closed the paper.\" \"It was his life.\" \"This is mine.'' He did not know that Wynand had once said all love is exception-making; and Wynand would not know that Roark bad loved him enough to make his greatest exception, one moment when he had tried to compromise .. Then be knew it was useless, like all sacrifices. What he said was his signature under her de- cision: ''I love you.\" 666"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"She looked about the room, to let the ordinary reality of walls and chairs help her keep the discipline she had been learning for this moment. The walls he had designed, the chairs he used, a package of his cigarettes on a table, the routine necessities of life that could acquire splendor when life became what it was now. \"Howard, I know what you intend to do at the trial. So it won't make any difference if they learn the truth about us.\" \"It won't make any difference.\" ''When ·you came that night and told me about Cortlandt, I didn't try to stop you.

It was settled and not to be discussed.

His fingers closed .over her wrist and he pulled her hand back .. He pulled her around to face him, and then he held her and his mouth was on hers. She knew that every moment of seven years when she had wanted this and stopped the pain and thought she had won, was not past, had never been stopped, had lived on, stored, adding hunger to hunger, and now she had to feel it all, the touch of his body, the answer and the waiting .together. . . She didn't know whether ·her discipline had helped; not too well, she thought, because she saw that he had lifted her in his arms, carried her to a chair and sat down, holding her on his knees; he laughed ·without sound, as he would have laughed at a child, but the firmness of his hands holding her showed coneem and a kind of steadying caution. ThC?n it seemed simple, she had nothing to hide from him, she whispered: \"Yes, Howard ... that much ...... and he said: \"It was vety hard ·fpr me-all these years.\" And the years were ended. _ She slipped down, to sit on the floor, her elbows propped on his knees, she looked up at him and smiled, she knew that she could not have reached this white serenity except as the SIJm of all the· colors, of all the violence she had known. \"Howard \" ..

It was growiiig dark, the room was indiStinguishable, only the window remained and his shoulders against the sky in the window . . She awakened with the sun in her eyes. She lay on her back, looking at the ceiling as she had looked at the leaves. Not to move, to guess by hints, to see everything through the greater in- tensity of implication. The broken triangles of light on the angu- lar mod~ling of the ceiling's plastic tiles meant that it was morning and that this was a bedroom at Monadnoek, the geom- . etry of fire and· structure above her designed . by hi.JD. The fire was white-that meant it was very early .and the rays came through clean country air, with nothing anywhere in space be- tween this bedroom and the sun. The weight of the blanket, heavy and intimate on her naked body, was everything that had . . been last night. And the skin she felt against heF arm was Roiuk asleep beside .her. She slipped out of bed: She stood at the window, her arms raised, holding on to the f'raiJle at each side. She thought if she looked back she would see no shadow of her body on the floor, she felt as if the sunlight went straight through her, because her body had no weight. · But she. had to hurry before he awakened. She found his pyja- mas in a dresser drawer and put tl\\em on. She went to the living room, closing the door carefully behind her.

Scarret could discover nothing in his eyes, except a kind of mild astonishment, as if Wynand were wondering what Scarret was doing here.

He said, with no change in the tone of his voice: \"I told you once that this building was to be a monument to my life. There is nothing to commemorate now. The Wynand · Building will have· nothing-except what you give it.\" He rose to his feet, indicating that the i~terview was ended. Roark got up and inclined his head in parting. He held his head down a moment longer than a formal bow required. At the door he stopped and turned. Wynand stood behind his ·desk without moving. They looked at each other. Wynand said: \"Build it as a monument to that spirit which is yours ... and could have been mine.\" 20 ON A spring day, eighteen mt.iths later, Dominique walked to the construction site of the Wynand Building. · She looked at the skyscrapers of the city. They rose from un- expected spots, out of the low roof lines. They had a kind of star- tling su$ldenness, as if they had sprung up the second before she saw them and she had caught the last thrust of the motion; as if, were· she to turn away and look again fast enough, she would catch them in the act of springing. She turned a comer of Hell's Kitchen and came to the vast cleared tract. Machines were crawling over the tom earth, grading the future park. From its center, the skeleton of the Wynand Building rose, completed. to the sky. The top part of the frame still hung naked, an intercrossed cage of steel. Glass and masonry had followed its rise, covering the rest of the long streak slashed through space. She thought: They say the heart of the earth is made of fire. It is held imprisoned and silent. But at times it breaks through the clay, the iron, the granite, and sh.oots out to freedom. Then it be- comes a ~ng like this. She walked to the building. A wooden fence surrounded its lower stories. The fence was bright with large signs advertising the names of the firms who had supplied materials for the tallest structure in the world. \"Steel by National Steel, Inc.\" \"Glass by Ludlow.\" \"Electrical Equipment by Wells-Clairmont.\" \"Elevators by Kessler, Inc.\" \"Nash & Dunning, Contractors.\" She stopped. She saw an object she had never noticed before. The sight was like the touch of a hand on her forehead, the hand 692"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"of those figures in legend who had the power to heal. She had not known Henry Cameron and she bad not beard him say it, but what she felt now was as if she were hearing. it: \"And I know that if you carry these words through to the end, it will be a vic- tory, Howard, not just for you, but for something that should 'win, that moves the world-and never· wins acknowledgment. It will vindicate ·so many who have fallen before you, who have suf- fered as you will suffer.\" • She saw, on the fence .surrounding New York's greatest build~ ing, a small tin plate bearing the words: \"Howard Roark, Architect\" She walked to the superintendent's shed. She bad come here often to call for Roark, to watch the progress of constrtJction. But there was a new man in the shed who did not know her. She asked for Roark. \"Mr. Roark is way up on top by the water tank. Who's calling, ma'am?'' ''Mrs. Roark,\" she answered. The man found the superintendent who let her ride the outside hoist, as she always. did-a few planks with a rope for a railing, that rose up the side of the building. She stood, her band lifted and closed about a cable, her high heels poised firmly on the planks. The planks shuddered, a cur- rent of air pressed· her skirt to her body, and she saw the ground dropping softly away from her. · She rose above the broad panes of shop windows. The chan-· nels of streets grew deeper, sinking. She rose above the marquees of movie theaters, .black ·mats held by spirals of color. Office windows streamed past her,. long belts of glass running down. The squat hulks of warehouses vanished, sinking with the trea- sure& they guarded. Hotel towers· slanted, like the spokes of an opening fan, and folded over. The fuming matchsticks were fac- . tory stacks and the moving gray squares were cars. The sun made lighthouses of peaked summits, they reeled, flashing long white rays over the city. The city spread out, marching in angular rows to the rivers. It stood held between two thin black arms of water. · It leaped across and rolled away to a haze of plains and sky. Flat roofs descended like pedals pressing the buildings down, out of the way of her flight. She went past the cubes of glass that held dining rooms, bedrooms and nurseries. She saw roof gar- dens float down like handkerchiefs spread on the wind. Sky- scrapers raced her and were left behind. The planks under her feet shot past the antennae of radio stations. The hoist swung like a pendulum above the city. It sped against the side of the building. It had passed the line where the 01asonry ended behind her. ~re was nothing ~hind her now 693"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"but steel ligaments and space.

The End 694"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"Afterword by Leonftrd Peikoff Before sJarting a novel, Ayn Rand wrote voluminously in her journals about its theme, characters, and plot. She wrote not for any outside reader, but for herself~for the clarity of her own un- derstanding. For her admirers, however, the FoUntainhead jour- nals are a cornucopia of treasures, all of wbjch will be published in due course. Among other things, they include her first sketches of the characters, notes· indicating the evolution of. the plot, her · own editorial analysis of the first draft of Part One, and extensive architectural research, with passages from the books of various authorities copied by hand and followed by her own comments. Throughout the journals, of course, in one form or another, there is alsO philosophy-that is, the ideas which were eveiltqally to culminate in Objectivism. From these journals, with the kind help of an associate, Gary Hull, I have selected for this Afterword entries of several kinds. They are being offered here as an advance bonus for Miss Rand's readers, to· mark the occasion of The Fountainhead's 50t)J. anni- versary. This material will give the (eader at least a glimpse of the novel being born-and of the author at work creating it by solving problems to which, thanks to her, he already knows ·the full, perfect answers. Ayn Rand's working title for the novel was Second-Hand Lives. The final title, chosen after the manuscript was completed, changes the emphasis: like the book, it gives primaey not to the villaips, but to the creative hero, the man who uses his mind first-handedly and becomes thereby the fountainhead of all achievement. · The first page of the handwritten manuscript of The Fountain- head is dated June 26, 1938. But years earlier Miss Rand was hard at work thinking about the book.

A year later, on February 22, 1937, Miss Rand is working on an early sketch of Toohey. Here are some excerpts: Ellsworth Monkton Toohey the non-creative \"second-hand\" man par excellenc&-the critic, expressing and molding the voice of public opinion, the average man at larg&-eondensed, representing the average ·man's qualities plus the peculiar qualities of his kind which make him the natural leader of average men. Theme song-a vicious, ingrown vanity coupled with an insane will to power, a lust for superiority that can be ex- pressed only through others, whom, therefore, he has 'o dominate, a natural inferiority complex subconsciously leading to the bringing down of everything into inferior- ity .... Went into \"Intellectualism\" in a big way. Two reasons: first, a subconscious revenge for his obvious physical in- feriority, a means to a power his body could never give him; second, and main-a cunning perception that only mental control over others is true control,- that if he can rule them mentally he is indeed their total ruler. His vanity is not .the passive one of Peter, who is really not con- earned with other people as such, Ollly as mirrors for his vanity; Toohey is very much concerned with other people in the sense of an overwhelming desire to dominate them .... [Toohey] has realized ahead of many others the tre- mendous power of numbers, the power of the masses which, for the first time, in the XX century, are acquiring real significance in all, even in the intellectual, depart- ments of life. In that sense, he is the man of the century, the genius of modern democracy in its worst meanin~. The- first cornerstone of his convictions is equality-his greatest passion. This includes the idea that, as two- legged human creatures, all possess certain intrinsic value by the mere fact of having been born in the shape of men, not apes. Any concrete, mental content inside the human shape does not matter. A great brain or a great talent o_r a magnificent character are of no importance as compared .. to that intrinsic value all possess as men- 699"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"whatev~r that may be. He is never clear on what that rnay be and rather annoyed when the question is raised.· ... Inasmuch as beliefs are important to him only as a means to an end, and that is.the extent of his belief in be- liefs, he is not bothered by his inconsistencies, by the vagueness and logical fallacy of his convictions. They are efficient and effective to secure the ends he is seeking. Tliey work-and that is all they're for .... Communism, the Soviet variety particularly,· is not merely an economic theory. It does not demand eco- nomic equality and security 1n order to set each individual free to rise as he chooses. Communism is, above all, a spiritual theory which denies the individual, not merely as an economic power, but in all and every respect. It de- mands spiritual subordination to the mass in every way conceivable, economic, intellectual, artistic; it allows indi- viduals to rise only as servants of the masses, only as mouthpieces for the great average. It places, among sin- gle individuals, Ellsworth Monkton Toohey at the top of . the human pyramid .... In opposing the existing order of society, it is not the big capitalists and their money that Toohey opposes; he op- poses the fading conceptions of individualism still existing in that society, and the privileged few as its material sym- bols. He says that he is fighting Rockefeller and Morgan; he is fighting Beethoven and Shakespeare .... Toohey studies voraciously. He has a magnificent memory for facts and statistics, he is known as a \"walk- ing encyclopedia.\" This is natural-since he has no crea- tive mind, only a repeating, aping, absorbing \"second-hand\" one. By the same token-his absorption in studies: he has nothing new to create, but can acquire importance by absorbing the works and achievements of others. He is a sponge, not a fresh sprin~. . . . · He is a man so completely poisoned spiritually, that his puny physical appearance seems to be a walking testi- monial to the spiritual pus filling his blood vessels. If her journals exhibit Ayn Rand in the passionate act of cre- ative work, they also reveal her dispassionately analyzing and criticizing some of the work's early stages. Here, for example, are her comments on the ftrst draft of Chapter One (February 18, 1940): Chapter I Roark planted too soon-(too much of him g1ven)-too obviously heroio-1he author's sympathy too clear.

During her high-school years, she was eyewitness to both the Kerensky Revolution, which she supported, and-in 1917-the Bol- shevik Revolution, which she denounced from the outset. In order to escape the fighting, her family went to the Crimea, where she finished high 8chool. The final Communist victory brought the cOn- fiscation of her father's pharmacy and periods of near-starv~tion. When intrOduced to American history in her last year of high school, she immediately took America as her model of what a nation of free men could be. When her family returned from the Crimea, she entered the University of Petrograd to study philosophy and history.

Although she told Soviet authorities that her visit would be short, she was determined never to return to Russia. Arriving in New York City in February 1926, she spent six months with her relatives in Chicago, obtained exten- sions- to her visa, and then left for Hollywood to pursue a career as a: screenwriter ..

During the next week at the studio she met an actor, Frank O'CoiUlor, whom she married in f929; they were married until his death fifty years later. After struggling for several years at various non-writing jobs, including one in the wardrobe department at RKO, she sold her first screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios in 1932 and saw her first stage play, Night of J~ 16th, produced in Hollywood and then on Broadway. Her first novel, We the Living, was com- pleted in 1933 but was rejected by publishers for years, until. Macmillan in the U.S. and Cassell in England published the book in 1936. The most autobiographical of her novels~it was based on her years under Soviet tyranny-We the Living was not well re- ceived by American intellectuals and reviewers. Ayn Rand was up against the pro-communism dominating the culture durin,g \"the Red Decade.\" She began writing The Fountainhead in 1935. In the character of the architect Howard Roark, she presented for the frrst time the kind of hero whose depiction was the chief goal of her. writing: _the ideal man, man as \"he could be and ought to be.\" The Fountain~ head was rejected by twelve publishers but finally accepted by Bobbs-Merri'll. When published in 1943 it made history by becom- ing a best seller through word-of-mouth two years later, and gained for its author lasting recognition as a champion of individualism. Ayn Rand returned to Hollywood in late 1943 to write the screenplay for The Foun,tainhead, but war-time restrictions delayed production until 1948. Working part time as a screenwriter for producer Hal Wallis, she began her major novel, Atlas Shrugged, in 1946. In 1951, she moved back to New York City and devoted full time to the completion of Atlas Slirugged. Published in 1957, Atlas Shrugged was her greatest achieve- ment and last work of fiction. In this novel, she dramatized her unique phil~?sophy in an intellectual mystery story that integrated ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, politics, economics, and sex. Although she considered herself primarily a fiction writer, she re- alized that in order to create heroic fictional characters, she had to identify t~e philosophic principles which make such individuals"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":". possible. She needed to formulate \"a philosophy for living on earth.\" Thereafter, Ayn Rand wrote and lectured on her philosophy- Objectivism. She published and edited her own periodicals from 1962 to 1976, her essays providing much of the materiill for nine books on Objectivism and its application to the culture. Ayn Rand died on March 6, 1982, in her New York City apartment. Every book by Ayn Rand published in her lifetime is still in print, and hundreds of thousands of copies are_ sold each year, so fa£ totillling more than twenty million. Severill new volumes have been published posthumously. Her vision of man and her philoso- phy. for ·nving on earth have changed the .lives. of thousands of readers and launched a philosophic movement with a growmg im- pact on American culture. · THE ESSENTIALS OF OBJECTIVISM \"My philo10phy, in essence, is the conceptofnum as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moml .·purpose of his Ufe, with productive achievement as his noblest acti..U,, ti1Ul reason as his only absolute. , Ayn Rluul . /'!.yn Rand named her philosophy \"Objectivism\" and described it.asa philosophy for livingon.earth. Objectivism-is ~-integrated system of thougllt that defmes the abstract principles- by which a man must think and act if he ls to live the life proper to man. Ayn Rand first· portrayed her philosophy in the· fomi of the hero~· of her beSt-selling novels, The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Slirugged (1957). She later expressed her philosophy in non-fiction form: Ayn Rand was once asked if she could present the essence of Objectivism while stahding on one foot. Her answer was; 1. Metaphysics: Objective Reality 2. Epistemology: Reason 3. Ethics: Self-interest 4. Politics: Capitalism· She then translated those tenits into familiar language: 1. \"Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.\" 2. \"You' can't eat your cake and have it too.\" 3. \"Man is an e~d in himself.\" 4. \"Give me liberty or give me death.\""},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"The basic ·principles of OJ>jectiviSm can be summarized as follows: · · 1. Metaphysics: \"Reality, tbe external world,· exists inde- pendent of man's consciousness, indepeJ!,dent of any observer's knowledge, beliefs, feelings, desires or fears. This .means that A is A, that factS are facts,_ that things are what they are-and that the task of man's consciousness is to perceive reality, iwt to create or invent it.\" Thus Objectivism reject$ any belief in the supernatu- ral-and any claim that individuals or groups create their own real- ity: 2. Epistemology: \"Man's reason is fully competent to know the facts of reality. Reason, the conceptual faculty, is the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses. Reason is man's ohly means of acquiring knowledge.\" Thus Ob- jectivism rejects mY,sticism (any acceptance of faith or feeling as a means of knowledge), and it rejects skepticism (the claim that cer- tainty or knowledge is impossible). · 3. Humilti Nature: Man is a rational being. Reason, as man's only means of knowledge, is his basic means of survival. But the exercise of reason depends on each individual's choice. \"Man is a being of volitional consciousness .. \" \"That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, aild that· which you call 'free will' is your mind's freedom to think or not, the only will you · have, your only freedom. [This isl the choice that' controls all the choices you make and determines your life and character.\" Thus · Objectivism rejects any form of determinism, the belief that man is a victim of forces beyond his control (such as God, fate, upbring- ing, genes or economic conditions). · 4. Ethics; \"Reason is man's only protier judge of values and his only proper guide to action. The proper standard of ethics is: man's survival qua man-i.e., that which is required by man's nature for his survival as a rational being (not his momentary physi- cal survival as a mindless brute). Rationality is man's basic virtue, and his three fur.damental values are: reason, purpose, self-esteem. Man-every man-is an end in himself, not a means to the ends of others; he must live for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"others nor sacrificing others to himself; he must work for his ratio- ~l self-interest, with the achievement of his own happiness as the highest moral purpose of his life.\" Thus Objectivism rejects any form of altruism-the claim that morality consists in living for oth- ers or for society. · 5. Politics: \"The basic social principle of the Objectivist eth- icsjs that no man has the right to seek values from others by means of physical force-i.e., no man or group has the right to initiate the use of physical force against· others. Men have the right to -Use force only in self-®fense and only against those who initiate its use. Men must deal with one another as tr(lflers, giving value for value, by free, mutual consent to mutual b~nefit. The only social system tltat bars physicai force from human relationships is laissez- faire capitalism. Capitalism is a system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights, in which ~e only func- tion _of the goven,unent is to protect individual rights, i.e., to pro- tect men from those who initiate the use of physical force.\" Thus Objectivism rejects any form of collectivism, such as fascism or socialism. It alSo rejects the current \"mixed economy\" notion that the government Should regulate the economy and redistribute wealth . . . 6. Esthetics: \"Art is a selective re-creation of reality accord- ing to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments.\" The purpose of art is to concretize the artist's fundamental view of existence. Ayn Rand described her own approach to art as \"Romantic Realism\": \"I am a Romantic in the sense that I present men as they. ought to be. I -am Realistic in the sense that I place them here and now and on this earth.\" The goal of Ayn Rand's novels is not didactic but artistic: the projection of an ideal man: \"My purpose, first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of Howard Roark or John Galt or Hank Reardan or Franci~ d' Anconia as an end in himself-not as a means to any further end.\""},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO THE WRITINGS OFAYN RAND NOVEJ,..S: Atlas Shrugged (1957): Ayn Rand's masterpiece.

Objectivism holds that historical trends are the product 'of phi- losophy. To reverse today' s destructive political and cultural trends we must reverse men's fundamental philosophy. The Institute ~rings Ayn Rand's ideas to the attention of stu- dents, scholars, businessmen, professio~ls, and the general pub- lic. Its educational programs include ~raduate training in philoso- phy, essay 'contests for high-school and college students, a net- work of campus Objectivist clubs, a campus speakers bureau, and scholarly research and publications.
