This series of articles is presented “by popular demand.” We have had so manyrequests for information on Objectivist epistemology that I decided to put onrecord a summary of one of its cardinal elements—the Objectivist theory ofconcepts. These articles may be regarded as a preview of my future book onObjectivism, and are offered here for the guidance of philosophy students.The issue of concepts (known as “the problem of universals”) is philosophy’scentral issue. Since man’s knowledge is gained and held in conceptual form, thevalidity of man’s knowledge depends on the validity of concepts. But conceptsare abstractions or universals, and everything that man perceives is particular,concrete. What is the relationship between abstractions and concretes? To whatprecisely do concepts refer in reality? Do they refer to something real,something that exists—or are they merely inventions of man’s mind, arbitraryconstructs or loose approximations that cannot claim to represent knowledge?“All knowledge is in terms of concepts. If these concepts correspond tosomething that is to be found in reality they are real and man’s knowledge has afoundation in fact; if they do not correspond to anything in reality they arenot real and man’s knowledge is of mere figments of his own imagination.”(Edward C. Moore, American Pragmatism: Peirce, James, & Dewey, New York:Columbia University Press, 1961, p. 27.)To exemplify the issue as it is usually presented: When we refer to threepersons as “men,” what do we designate by that term? The three persons are threeindividuals who differ in every particular respect and may not possess a singleidentical characteristic (not even their fingerprints). If you list all theirparticular characteristics, you will not find one representing “manness.” Whereis the “manness” in men? What, in reality, corresponds to the concept “man” inour mind?In the history of philosophy, there are, essentially, four schools of thought onthis issue:1. The “extreme realists” or Platonists, who hold that abstractions exist asreal entities or archetypes in another dimension of reality and that theconcretes we perceive are merely their imperfect reflections, but the concretesevoke the abstractions in our mind. (According to Plato, they do so by evokingthe memory of the archetypes which we had known, before birth, in that otherdimension.)2. The “moderate realists,” whose ancestor (unfortunately) is Aristotle, whohold that abstractions exist in reality, but they exist only in concretes, inthe form of metaphysical essences, and that our concepts refer to theseessences.3. The “nominalists,” who hold that all our ideas are only images of concretes,and that abstractions are merely “names” which we give to arbitrary groupings ofconcretes on the basis of vague resemblances.4. The “conceptualists,” who share the nominalists’ view that abstractions haveno actual basis in reality, but who hold that concepts exist in our minds assome sort of ideas, not as images. (There is also the extreme nominalistposition, the modern one, which consists of declaring that the problem is ameaningless issue, that “reality” is a meaningless term, that we can never knowwhether our concepts correspond to anything or not, that our knowledge consistsof words—and that words are an arbitrary social convention.)If, in the light of such “solutions,” the problem might appear to be esoteric,let me remind you that the fate of human societies, of knowledge, of science, ofprogress and of every human life, depends on it. What is at stake here is thecognitive efficacy of man’s mind.As I wrote in For the New Intellectual: “To negate man’s mind, it is theconceptual level of his consciousness that has to be invalidated. Under all thetortuous complexities, contradictions, equivocations, rationalizations of thepost-Renaissance philosophy—the one consistent line, the fundamental thatexplains the rest, is: a concerted attack on man’s conceptual faculty. Mostphilosophers did not intend to invalidate conceptual knowledge, but itsdefenders did more to destroy it than did its enemies. They were unable to offera solution to the ‘problem of universals,’ that is: to define the nature andsource of abstractions, to determine the relationship of concepts to perceptualdata—and to prove the validity of scientific induction.... The philosophers wereunable to refute the Witch Doctor’s claim that their concepts were as arbitraryas his whims and that their scientific knowledge had no greater metaphysicalvalidity than his revelations.”These are the reasons why I chose to introduce you to Objectivist epistemologyby presenting my theory of concepts. I entitle this work an “Introduction,”because the theory is presented outside of its full context. For instance, I donot include here a discussion of the validity of man’s senses—since thearguments of those who attack the senses are merely variants of the fallacy ofthe “stolen concept.”For the purposes of this series, the validity of the senses must be taken forgranted—and one must remember the axiom: Existence exists. (This, incidentally,is a way of translating into the form of a proposition, and thus into the formof an axiom, the primary fact which is existence.) Please bear in mind the fullstatement: “Existence exists—and the act of grasping that statement implies twocorollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one existspossessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving thatwhich exists.” (Atlas Shrugged.) (For the reader’s convenience, a summary of the text is provided at theconclusion of this work.)—AYN RANDNew York, July 1966."},{"pageContent":"1.Cognition and MeasurementConsciousness, as a state of awareness, is not a passive state, but an activeprocess that consists of two essentials: differentiation and integration.Although, chronologically, man’s consciousness develops in three stages: thestage of sensations, the perceptual, the conceptual—epistemologically, the baseof all of man’s knowledge is the perceptual stage.Sensations, as such, are not retained in man’s memory, nor is man able toexperience a pure isolated sensation. As far as can be ascertained, an infant’ssensory experience is an undifferentiated chaos. Discriminated awareness beginson the level of percepts.A percept is a group of sensations automatically retained and integrated by thebrain of a living organism. It is in the form of percepts that man grasps theevidence of his senses and apprehends reality. When we speak of “directperception” or “direct awareness,” we mean the perceptual level. Percepts, notsensations, are the given, the self-evident. The knowledge of sensations ascomponents of percepts is not direct, it is acquired by man much later: it is ascientific, conceptual discovery.The building-block of man’s knowledge is the concept of an “existent”—ofsomething that exists, be it a thing, an attribute or an action. Since it is aconcept, man cannot grasp it explicitly until he has reached the conceptualstage. But it is implicit in every percept (to perceive a thing is to perceivethat it exists) and man grasps it implicitly on the perceptual level—i.e., hegrasps the constituents of the concept “existent,” the data which are later tobe integrated by that concept. It is this implicit knowledge that permits hisconsciousness to develop further.(It may be supposed that the concept “existent” is implicit even on the level ofsensations—if and to the extent that a consciousness is able to discriminate onthat level. A sensation is a sensation of something, as distinguished from thenothing of the preceding and succeeding moments. A sensation does not tell manwhat exists, but only that it exists.)The (implicit) concept “existent” undergoes three stages of development in man’smind. The first stage is a child’s awareness of objects, of things—whichrepresents the (implicit) concept “entity.” The second and closely allied stageis the awareness of specific, particular things which he can recognize anddistinguish from the rest of his perceptual field—which represents the(implicit) concept “identity.”The third stage consists of grasping relationships among these entities bygrasping the similarities and differences of their identities. This requires thetransformation of the (implicit) concept “entity” into the (implicit) concept“unit.”When a child observes that two objects (which he will later learn to designateas “tables”) resemble each other, but are different from four other objects(“chairs”), his mind is focusing on a particular attribute of the objects (theirshape), then isolating them according to their differences, and integrating themas units into separate groups according to their similarities.This is the key, the entrance to the conceptual level of man’s consciousness.The ability to regard entities as units is man’s distinctive method ofcognition, which other living species are unable to follow.A unit is an existent regarded as a separate member of a group of two or moresimilar members. (Two stones are two units; so are two square feet of ground, ifregarded as distinct parts of a continuous stretch of ground.) Note that theconcept “unit” involves an act of consciousness (a selective focus, a certainway of regarding things), but that it is not an arbitrary creation ofconsciousness: it is a method of identification or classification according tothe attributes which a consciousness observes in reality. This method permitsany number of classifications and cross-classifications: one may classify thingsaccording to their shape or color or weight or size or atomic structure; but thecriterion of classification is not invented, it is perceived in reality. Thusthe concept “unit” is a bridge between metaphysics and epistemology: units donot exist qua units, what exists are things, but units are things viewed by aconsciousness in certain existing relationships.With the grasp of the (implicit) concept “unit” man reaches the conceptual levelof cognition, which consists of two interrelated fields: the conceptual and themathematical. The process of concept-formation is, in large part, a mathematicalprocess.Mathematics is the science of measurement. Before proceeding to the subject ofconcept-formation, let us first consider the subject of measurement.Measurement is the identification of a relationship—a quantitative relationshipestablished by means of a standard that serves as a unit. Entities (and theiractions) are measured by their attributes (length, weight, velocity, etc.) andthe standard of measurement is a concretely specified unit representing theappropriate attribute. Thus, one measures length in inches, feet andmiles—weight in pounds—velocity by means of a given distance traversed in agiven time, etc.It is important to note that while the choice of a given standard is optional,the mathematical rules of using it are not. It makes no difference whether onemeasures length in terms of feet or meters; the standard provides only the formof notation, not the substance nor the result of the process of measuring. Thefacts established by measurement will be the same, regardless of the particularstandard used; the standard can neither alter nor affect them. The requirementsof a standard of measurement are: that it represent the appropriate attribute,that it be easily perceivable by man and that, once chosen, it remain immutableand absolute whenever used. (Please remember this; we will have reason to recallit.)Now what is the purpose of measurement? Observe that measurement consists ofrelating an easily perceivable unit to larger or smaller quantities, then toinfinitely larger or infinitely smaller quantities, which are not directlyperceivable to man. (The word “infinitely” is used here as a mathematical, not ametaphysical, term.) The purpose of measurement is to expand the range of man’sconsciousness, of his knowledge, beyond the perceptual level: beyond the directpower of his senses and the immediate concretes of any given moment. Man canperceive the length of one foot directly; he cannot perceive ten miles. Byestablishing the relationship of feet to miles, he can grasp and know anydistance on earth; by establishing the relationship of miles to light-years, hecan know the distances of galaxies.The process of measurement is a process of integrating an unlimited scale ofknowledge to man’s limited perceptual experience—a process of making theuniverse knowable by bringing it within the range of man’s consciousness, byestablishing its relationship to man. It is not an accident that man’s earliestattempts at measurement (the evidence of which survives to this day) consistedof relating things to himself—as, for instance, taking the length of his foot asa standard of length, or adopting the decimal system, which is supposed to haveits origin in man’s ten fingers as units of counting.It is here that Protagoras’ old dictum may be given a new meaning, the oppositeof the one he intended: “Man is the measure of all things.” Man is the measure,epistemologically—not metaphysically. In regard to human knowledge, man has tobe the measure, since he has to bring all things into the realm of the humanlyknowable. But, far from leading to subjectivism, the methods which he has toemploy require the most rigorous mathematical precision, the most rigorouscompliance with objective rules and facts—if the end product is to be knowledge.This is true of mathematical principles and of the principles by which man formshis concepts. Man’s mathematical and conceptual abilities developsimultaneously. A child learns to count when he is learning his first words. Andin order to proceed beyond the stage of counting his ten fingers, it is theconceptual level of his consciousness that man has to expand."},{"pageContent":"2.Concept-FormationA concept is a mental integration of two or more units which are isolatedaccording to a specific characteristic(s) and united by a specific definition.The units involved may be any aspect of reality: entities, attributes, actions,qualities, relationships, etc.; they may be perceptual concretes or other,earlier-formed concepts. The act of isolation involved is a process ofabstraction: i.e., a selective mental focus that takes out or separates acertain aspect of reality from all others (e.g., isolates a certain attibutefrom the entities possessing it, or a certain action from the entitiesperforming it, etc.). The uniting involved is not a mere sum, but anintegration, i.e., a blending of the units into a single, new mental entitywhich is used thereafter as a single unit of thought (but which can be brokeninto its component units whenever required).In order to be used as a single unit, the enormous sum integrated by a concepthas to be given the form of a single, specific, perceptual concrete, which willdifferentiate it from all other concretes and from all other concepts. This isthe function performed by language. Language is a code of visual-auditorysymbols that serves the psycho-epistemological function of converting conceptsinto the mental equivalent of concretes. Language is the exclusive domain andtool of concepts. Every word we use (with the exception of proper names) is asymbol that denotes a concept, i.e., that stands for an unlimited number ofconcretes of a certain kind.(Proper names are used in order to identify and include particular entities in aconceptual method of cognition. Observe that even proper names, in advancedcivilizations, follow the definitional principles of genus and differentia:e.g., John Smith, with “Smith” serving as genus and “John” as differentia— orNew York, U.S.A.)Words transform concepts into (mental) entities; definitions provide them withidentity. (Words without definitions are not language but inarticulate sounds.)We shall discuss definitions later and at length.The above is a general description of the nature of concepts as products of acertain mental process. But the question of epistemology is: what precisely isthe nature of that process? To what precisely do concepts refer in reality?Let us now examine the process of forming the simplest concept, the concept of asingle attribute (chronologically, this is not the first concept that a childwould grasp; but it is the simplest one epistemologically)—for instance, theconcept “length.” If a child considers a match, a pencil and a stick, heobserves that length is the attribute they have in common, but their specificlengths differ. The difference is one of measurement. In order to form theconcept “length,” the child’s mind retains the attribute and omits itsparticular measurements. Or, more precisely, if the process were identified inwords, it would consist of the following: “Length must exist in some quantity,but may exist in any quantity. I shall identify as ‘length’ that attribute ofany existent possessing it which can be quantitatively related to a unit oflength, without specifying the quantity.”The child does not think in such words (he has, as yet, no knowledge of words),but that is the nature of the process which his mind performs wordlessly. Andthat is the principle which his mind follows, when, having grasped the concept“length” by observing the three objects, he uses it to identify the attribute oflength in a piece of string, a ribbon, a belt, a corridor or a street.The same principle directs the process of forming concepts of entities—forinstance, the concept “table.” The child’s mind isolates two or more tables fromother objects, by focusing on their distinctive characteristic: their shape. Heobserves that their shapes vary, but have one characteristic in common: a flat,level surface and support(s). He forms the concept “table” by retaining thatcharacteristic and omitting all particular measurements, not only themeasurements of the shape, but of all the other characteristics of tables (manyof which he is not aware of at the time).An adult definition of “table” would be: “A man-made object consisting of aflat, level surface and support(s), intended to support other, smaller objects.”Observe what is specified and what is omitted in this definition: thedistinctive characteristic of the shape is specified and retained; theparticular geometrical measurements of the shape (whether the surface is square,round, oblong or triangular, etc., the number and shape of supports, etc.) areomitted; the measurements of size or weight are omitted; the fact that it is amaterial object is specified, but the material of which it is made is omitted,thus omitting the measurements that differentiate one material from another;etc. Observe, however, that the utilitarian requirements of the table setcertain limits on the omitted measurements, in the form of “no larger than andno smaller than” required by its purpose. This rules out a ten-foot tall or atwo-inch tall table (though the latter may be sub-classified as a toy or aminiature table) and it rules out unsuitable materials, such as non-solids.Bear firmly in mind that the term “measurements omitted” does not mean, in thiscontext, that measurements are regarded as non-existent; it means thatmeasurements exist, but are not specified. That measurements must exist is anessential part of the process. The principle is: the relevant measurements mustexist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity.A child is not and does not have to be aware of all these complexities when heforms the concept “table.” He forms it by differentiating tables from all otherobjects in the context of his knowledge. As his knowledge grows, the definitionsof his concepts grow in complexity. (We shall discuss this when we discussdefinitions.) But the principle and pattern of concept-formation remain thesame.The first words a child learns are words denoting visual objects, and he retainshis first concepts visually. Observe that the visual form he gives them isreduced to those essentials which distinguish the particular kind of entitiesfrom all others—for instance, the universal type of a child’s drawing of man inthe form of an oval for the torso, a circle for the head, four sticks forextremities, etc. Such drawings are a visual record of the process ofabstraction and concept-formation in a mind’s transition from the perceptuallevel to the full vocabulary of the conceptual level.There is evidence to suppose that written language originated in the form ofdrawings—as the pictographic writing of the Oriental peoples seems to indicate.With the growth of man’s knowledge and of his power of abstraction, a pictorialrepresentation of concepts could no longer be adequate to his conceptual range,and was replaced by a fully symbolic code.A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the samedistinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.The element of similarity is crucially involved in the formation of everyconcept; similarity, in this context, is the relationship between two or moreexistents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure ordegree.Observe the multiple role of measurements in the process of concept-formation,in both of its two essential parts: differentiation and integration. Conceptscannot be formed at random. All concepts are formed by first differentiating twoor more existents from other existents. All conceptual differentiations are madein terms of commensurable characteristics (i.e., characteristics possessing acommon unit of measurement). No concept could be formed, for instance, byattempting to distinguish long objects from green objects. Incommensurablecharacteristics cannot be integrated into one unit.Tables, for instance, are first differentiated from chairs, beds and otherobjects by means of the characteristic of shape, which is an attribute possessedby all the objects involved. Then, their particular kind of shape is set as thedistinguishing characteristic of tables—i.e., a certain category of geometricalmeasurements of shape is specified. Then, within that category, the particularmeasurements of individual table-shapes are omitted.Please note the fact that a given shape represents a certain category or set ofgeometrical measurements. Shape is an attribute; differences of shape—whethercubes, spheres, cones or any complex combinations—are a matter of differingmeasurements; any shape can be reduced to or expressed by a set of figures interms of linear measurement. When, in the process of concept-formation, manobserves that shape is a commensurable characteristic of certain objects, hedoes not have to measure all the shapes involved nor even to know how to measurethem; he merely has to observe the element of similarity.Similarity is grasped perceptually; in observing it, man is not and does nothave to be aware of the fact that it involves a matter of measurement. It is thetask of philosophy and of science to identify that fact.As to the actual process of measuring shapes, a vast part of higher mathematics,from geometry on up, is devoted to the task of discovering methods by whichvarious shapes can be measured—complex methods which consist of reducing theproblem to the terms of a simple, primitive method, the only one available toman in this field: linear measurement. (Integral calculus, used to measure thearea of circles, is just one example.)In this respect, concept-formation and applied mathematics have a similar task,just as philosophical epistemology and theoretical mathematics have a similargoal: the goal and task of bringing the universe within the range of man’sknowledge—by identifying relationships to perceptual data.Another example of implicit measurement can be seen in the process of formingconcepts of colors. Man forms such concepts by observing that the various shadesof blue are similar, as against the shades of red, and thus differentiating therange of blue from the range of red, of yellow, etc. Centuries passed beforescience discovered the unit by which colors could actually be measured: thewavelengths of light—a discovery that supported, in terms of mathematical proof,the differentiations that men were and are making in terms of visualsimilarities. (Any questions about “borderline cases” will be answered later.)A commensurable characteristic (such as shape in the case of tables, or hue inthe case of colors) is an essential element in the process of concept-formation.I shall designate it as the “Conceptual Common Denominator” and define it as“The characteristic(s) reducible to a unit of measurement, by means of which mandifferentiates two or more existents from other existents possessing it.”The distinguishing characteristic(s) of a concept represents a specifiedcategory of measurements within the “Conceptual Common Denominator” involved.New concepts can be formed by integrating earlier-formed concepts into widercategories, or by subdividing them into narrower categories (a process which weshall discuss later). But all concepts are ultimately reducible to their base inperceptual entities, which are the base (the given) of man’s cognitivedevelopment.The first concepts man forms are concepts of entities—since entities are theonly primary existents. (Attributes cannot exist by themselves, they are merelythe characteristics of entities; motions are motions of entities; relationshipsare relationships among entities.)In the process of forming concepts of entities, a child’s mind has to focus on adistinguishing characteristic—i.e., on an attribute—in order to isolate onegroup of entities from all others. He is, therefore, aware of attributes whileforming his first concepts, but he is aware of them perceptually, notconceptually. It is only after he has grasped a number of concepts of entitiesthat he can advance to the stage of abstracting attributes from entities andforming separate concepts of attributes. The same is true of concepts of motion:a child is aware of motion perceptually, but cannot conceptualize “motion” untilhe has formed some concepts of that which moves, i.e., of entities.(As far as can be ascertained, the perceptual level of a child’s awareness issimilar to the awareness of the higher animals: the higher animals are able toperceive entities, motions, attributes, and certain numbers of entities. Butwhat an animal cannot perform is the process of abstraction—of mentallyseparating attributes, motions or numbers from entities. It has been said thatan animal can perceive two oranges or two potatoes, but cannot grasp the concept“two.”)Concepts of materials are formed by observing the differences in the constituentmaterials of entities. (Materials exist only in the form of specific entities,such as a nugget of gold, a plank of wood, a drop or an ocean of water.) Theconcept of “gold,” for instance, is formed by isolating gold objects from allothers, then abstracting and retaining the material, the gold, and omitting themeasurements of the objects (or of the alloys) in which gold may exist. Thus,the material is the same in all the concrete instances subsumed under theconcept, and differs only in quantity.Concepts of motion are formed by specifying the distinctive nature of the motionand of the entities performing it, and/or of the medium in which it isperformed—and omitting the particular measurements of any given instance of suchmotion and of the entities involved. For instance, the concept “walking” denotesa certain kind of motion performed by living entities possessing legs, and doesnot apply to the motion of a snake or of an automobile. The concept “swimming”denotes the motion of any living entity propelling itself through water, anddoes not apply to the motion of a boat. The concept “flying” denotes the motionof any entity propelling itself through the air, whether a bird or an airplane.Adverbs are concepts of the characteristics of motion (or action); they areformed by specifying a characteristic and omitting the measurements of themotion and of the entities involved—e.g., “rapidly,” which may be applied to“walking” or “swimming” or “speaking,” etc., with the measurement of what is“rapid” left open and depending, in any given case, on the type of motioninvolved.Prepositions are concepts of relationships, predominantly of spatial or temporalrelationships, among existents; they are formed by specifying the relationshipand omitting the measurements of the existents and of the space or timeinvolved—e.g., “on,” “in,” “above,” “after,” etc.Adjectives are concepts of attributes or of characteristics. Pronouns belong tothe category of concepts of entities. Conjunctions are concepts of relationshipsamong thoughts, and belong to the category of concepts of consciousness.As to concepts of consciousness, we shall discuss them later and at length. (Toanticipate questions such as: “Can you measure love?”—I shall permit myself thevery philosophical answer: “And how!”)Now we can answer the question: To what precisely do we refer when we designatethree persons as “men”? We refer to the fact that they are living beings whopossess the same characteristic distinguishing them from all other livingspecies: a rational faculty—though the specific measurements of theirdistinguishing characteristic qua men, as well as of all their othercharacteristics qua living beings, are different. (As living beings of a certainkind, they possess innumerable characteristics in common: the same shape, thesame range of size, the same facial features, the same vital organs, the samefingerprints, etc., and all these characteristics differ only in theirmeasurements.)Two links between the conceptual and the mathematical fields are worth noting atthis point, apart from the obvious fact that the concept “unit” is the base andstart of both.1. A concept is not formed by observing every concrete subsumed under it, anddoes not specify the number of such concretes. A concept is like an arithmeticalsequence of specifically defined units, going off in both directions, open atboth ends and including all units of that particular kind. For instance, theconcept “man” includes all men who live at present, who have ever lived or willever live. An arithmetical sequence extends into infinity, without implying thatinfinity actually exists; such extension means only that whatever number ofunits does exist, it is to be included in the same sequence. The same principleapplies to concepts: the concept “man” does not (and need not) specify whatnumber of men will ultimately have existed—it specifies only the characteristicsof man, and means that any number of entities possessing these characteristicsis to be identified as “men.”2. The basic principle of concept-formation (which states that the omittedmeasurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity) is theequivalent of the basic principle of algebra, which states that algebraicsymbols must be given some numerical value, but may be given any value. In thissense and respect, perceptual awareness is the arithmetic, but conceptualawareness is the algebra of cognition.The relationship of concepts to their constituent particulars is the same as therelationship of algebraic symbols to numbers. In the equation 2a = a + a, anynumber may be substituted for the symbol “a” without affecting the truth of theequation. For instance: 2 X 5 = 5 + 5, or: 2 X 5,000,000 = 5,000,000 +5,000,000. In the same manner, by the same psycho-epistemological method, aconcept is used as an algebraic symbol that stands for any of the arithmeticalsequence of units it subsumes.Let those who attempt to invalidate concepts by declaring that they cannot find“manness” in men, try to invalidate algebra by declaring that they cannot find“a-ness” in 5 or in 5,000,000."},{"pageContent":"3.Abstraction from AbstractionsStarting from the base of conceptual development—from the concepts that identifyperceptual concretes—the process of cognition moves in two interactingdirections: toward more extensive and more intensive knowledge, toward widerintegrations and more precise differentiations. Following the process and inaccordance with cognitive evidence, earlier-formed concepts are integrated intowider ones or subdivided into narrower ones.The role of language (which we shall discuss at length when we discussdefinitions) must be mentioned briefly at this point. The process of forming aconcept is not complete until its constituent units have been integrated into asingle mental unit by means of a specific word. The first concepts a child formsare concepts of perceptual entities; the first words he learns are wordsdesignating them. Even though a child does not have to perform the feat ofgenius performed by some mind or minds in the prehistorical infancy of the humanrace: the invention of language—every child has to perform independently thefeat of grasping the nature of language, the process of symbolizing concepts bymeans of words.Even though a child does not (and need not) originate and form every concept onhis own, by observing every aspect of reality confronting him, he has to performthe process of differentiating and integrating perceptual concretes, in order tograsp the meaning of words. If a child’s brain is physically damaged and unableto perform that process, he does not learn to speak.Learning to speak does not consist of memorizing sounds—that is the process bywhich a parrot learns to “speak.” Learning consists of grasping meanings, i.e.,of grasping the referents of words, the kinds of existents that words denote inreality. In this respect, the learning of words is an invaluable accelerator ofa child’s cognitive development, but it is not a substitute for the process ofconcept-formation; nothing is.After the first stage of learning certain fundamentals, there is no particularorder in which a child learns new concepts; there is, for a while, a broad areaof the optional, where he may learn simple, primary concepts and complex,derivative ones almost concurrently, depending on his own mental initiative andon the random influences of his environment. The particular order in which helearns new words is of no significance, at this stage, provided he understandstheir meanings. His full, independent conceptual development does not beginuntil he has acquired a sufficient vocabulary to be able to form sentences—i.e.,to be able to think (at which time he can gradually bring order to his haphazardconceptual equipment). Up to that time, he is able to retain the referents ofhis concepts by perceptual, predominantly visual means; as his conceptual chainmoves farther and farther away from perceptual concretes, the issue of verbaldefinitions becomes crucial. It is at this point that all hell breaks loose.Apart from the fact that the educational methods of most of his elders are suchthat, instead of helping him, they tend to cripple his further development, achild’s own choice and motivation are crucial at this point. There are manydifferent ways in which children proceed to learn new words thereafter. Some (avery small minority) proceed straight on, by the same method as before, i.e., bytreating words as concepts, by requiring a clear, first-hand understanding(within the context of their knowledge) of the exact meaning of every word theylearn, never allowing a break in the chain linking their concepts to the factsof reality. Some proceed by the road of approximations, where the fog deepenswith every step, where the use of words is guided by the feeling: “I kinda knowwhat I mean.” Some switch from cognition to imitation, substituting memorizingfor understanding, and adopt something as close to a parrot’spsycho-epistemology as a human brain can come—learning, not concepts nor words,but strings of sounds whose referents are not the facts of reality, but thefacial expressions and emotional vibrations of their elders. And some (theoverwhelming majority) adopt a precarious mixture of different degrees of allthree methods.But the question of how particular men happen to learn concepts and the questionof what concepts are, are two different issues. In considering the nature ofconcepts and the process of abstracting from abstractions, we must assume a mindcapable of performing (or of retracing and checking) that process. And we mustremember that no matter how many men mouth a concept as a meaningless sound,some man had to originate it at some time.The first stages of integrating concepts into wider concepts are fairly simple,because they still refer to perceptual concretes. For instance, man observesthat the objects which he has identified by the concepts “table,” “chair,”“bed,” “cabinet,” etc. have certain similarities, but are different from theobjects he has identified as “door,” “window,” “picture,” “drapes”—and heintegrates the former into the wider concept “furniture.” In this process,concepts serve as units and are treated epistemologically as if each were asingle (mental) concrete—always remembering that metaphysically (i.e., inreality) each unit stands for an unlimited number of actual concretes of acertain kind.The distinguishing characteristics of these units are specified categories ofmeasurements of shape, such as “a flat, level surface and support(s)” in thecase of tables. In relation to the new concept, these distinguishingcharacteristics are now regarded in the same manner as the measurements ofindividual table-shapes were regarded in forming the concept “table”: they areomitted, on the principle that a piece of furniture must have some shape, butmay have any of the shapes characterizing the various units subsumed under thenew concept.The distinguishing characteristic of the new concept is determined by the natureof the objects from which its constituent units are being differentiated, i.e.,by their “Conceptual Common Denominator,” which, in this case, is: large objectsinside a human habitation. The adult definition of “furniture” would be:“Movable man-made objects intended to be used in a human habitation, which cansupport the weight of the human body or support and/or store other, smallerobjects.” This differentiates “furniture” from architectural features, such asdoors or windows, from ornamental objects, such as pictures or drapes, and froma variety of smaller objects that may be used inside a habitation, such asashtrays, bric-a-brac, dishes, etc.The distinguishing characteristics of “furniture” are a specified range offunctions in a specified place (both are measurable characteristics):“furniture” must be no larger than can be placed inside a human habitation, nosmaller than can perform the specified functions, etc.Observe that the concept “furniture” is an abstraction one step further removedfrom perceptual reality than any of its constituent concepts. “Table” is anabstraction, since it designates any table, but its meaning can be conveyedsimply by pointing to one or two perceptual objects. There is no such perceptualobject as “furniture”; there are only tables, chairs, beds, etc. The meaning of“furniture” cannot be grasped unless one has first grasped the meaning of itsconstituent concepts; these are its link to reality. (On the lower levels of anunlimited conceptual chain, this is an illustration of the hierarchicalstructure of concepts.)Observe also that the concept “furniture” involves a relationship to anotherconcept which is not one of its constituent units, but which has to be graspedbefore one can grasp the meaning of “furniture”: the concept “habitation.” Thiskind of interrelationship among concepts grows progressively more complex as thelevel of concept-formation grows farther away from perceptual concretes.Now let us examine the process of subdividing the concept “table.” By observingthe differences in the size and function of various tables, man subdivides theconcept into: “dining table,” “coffee table,” “end table,” “desk,” etc. In thefirst three instances, the distinguishing characteristic of “table,” its shape,is retained, and the differentiations are purely a matter of measurement: therange of the shape’s measurements is reduced in accordance with the narrowerutilitarian function. (Coffee tables are lower and smaller than dining tables;end tables are higher than coffee tables, but lower than dining tables, etc.) Inthe case of “desk,” however, the distinguishing characteristic of “table” isretained, but combined with a new element: a “desk” is a table with drawers forstoring stationery supplies. The first three instances are not actually newconcepts, but qualified instances of the concept “table.” “Desk,” however,involves a significant difference in its distinguishing characteristic; itinvolves an additional category of measurements, and is given a new linguisticsymbol. (As far as the process of concept-formation is concerned, it would makeno difference if “desk” were designated as “office table,” or if a new word werecoined for each of the other sub-categories of “table.” There is, however, anepistemological reason for the present designations, which we shall discuss whenwe discuss definitions.)When concepts are integrated into a wider one, the new concept includes all thecharacteristics of its constituent units; but their distinguishingcharacteristics are regarded as omitted measurements, and one of their commoncharacteristics determines the distinguishing characteristic of the new concept:the one representing their “Conceptual Common Denominator” with the existentsfrom which they are being differentiated.When a concept is subdivided into narrower ones, its distinguishingcharacteristic is taken as their “Conceptual Common Denominator”—and is given anarrower range of specified measurements or is combined with an additionalcharacteristic(s), to form the individual distinguishing characteristics of thenew concepts.Let us observe these two principles on another example: the ramifications of theconcept “man.”Man’s particular type of consciousness is the distinguishing characteristic bywhich a child (at a certain level of development) differentiates him from allother entities. By observing the similarities among “cat,” “dog,” “horse,”“bird,” and by differentiating them from other entities, he integrates them intothe wider concept “animal”—and, later, includes “man” in this wider concept. Thedefinition of “animal” (in general terms) would be: “A living entity possessingthe faculties of consciousness and locomotion.”Man’s distinguishing characteristic, his rational faculty, is omitted from thedefinition of “animal”—on the principle that an animal must possess some type ofconsciousness, but may possess any of the types characterizing the various unitssubsumed under the new concept. (The standard of measurement that differentiatesone type of consciousness from another is its range.)The distinguishing characteristics of the new concept are characteristicspossessed by all its constituent units: the attribute “living” and the faculties“consciousness and locomotion.”With further knowledge, by observing the similarities among animals, plants andcertain sub-microscopic entities (and their differences from inanimate objects),man integrates them into the concept “organism.” The definition of “organism”(in general terms) would be: “An entity possessing the capacities of internallygenerated action, of growth through metabolism, and of reproduction.”These distinguishing characteristics of the new concept are possessed by all itsconstituent units. The distinguishing characteristics of “animal” are omittedfrom the definition—on the principle that the “internally generated actions”must exist in some form (including “consciousness and locomotion”), but mayexist in any of the forms characterizing the various units subsumed under thenew concept.With the growth of man’s knowledge, a very broad concept, such as “animal,” issubdivided into new concepts, such as: “mammal,” “amphibian,” “fish,” “bird,”etc. Each of these is then subdivided further and further into narrowersub-categories. The principle of concept-formation remains the same: thedistinguishing characteristics of the concept “animal” (the faculties of“consciousness and locomotion”) are the “Conceptual Common Denominator” of thesesubdivisions, and are retained but qualified by the addition of other(anatomical and physiological) characteristics to form the distinguishingcharacteristics of the new concepts.(The chronological order in which man forms or learns these concepts isoptional. A child, for instance, may first integrate the appropriate concretesinto the concepts “animal,” “bird,” “fish,” then later integrate them into awider concept by expanding his concept of “animal.” The principles involved andthe ultimate choice of distinguishing characteristics will be the same, grantinghe reaches the same level of knowledge.)Turning now to the process of conceptual subdivision, the concept “man” can besubdivided into innumerable subcategories, according to various aspects orattributes. For instance, such concepts as “child,” “adolescent,” “youth,”“adult” are formed according to measurements of time, i.e., according to thenumber of years lived. These concepts retain the distinguishing characteristicof “rational animal” but narrowed by a specified range of years.The concept “man” can be subdivided according to special characteristics, suchas racial (anatomical) descent: “Caucasian,” “Negro,” “Mongolian,” etc.—ornational (politico-geographical) origin: “American,” “Englishman,” “French-man,”etc.—or professional activity: “Engineer,” “Doctor,” “Artist,” etc. (whichinvolve concepts of consciousness)—or even according to such characteristics asthe color of hair: “Blonde,” “Brunette,” “Redhead.” In all such cases, thedistinguishing characteristic of “rational animal” is retained but narrowed byspecified characteristics which represent specified categories of measurements.The concept “man” can be subdivided according to special relationships—forinstance, according to a biological relationship (“Father,” “Son,” “Brother”),or a legal relationship (“Husband,” “Wife”), or an economic relationship(“Employer,” “Employee”), etc. In all such cases, the characteristic of“rational animal” is retained but combined with a specified relationship.Some concepts of relationships (such as “legal” or “economic”) involve conceptsof consciousness. The most complex abstractions (both in regard to widerintegrations and narrower subdivisions) are those which involve a combination ofconcepts of action with concepts of consciousness. (We shall discuss these inthe next chapter.)Two aspects of the cognitive content of abstractions are worth noting at thispoint.1. The formation (or the learning) of wider concepts requires more knowledge(i.e., a wider range of conceptualized evidence) than was required by any one ofthe constituent concepts which they subsume. For instance, the concept “animal”requires more knowledge than the concept “man” —since it requires knowledge ofman and of some of the other species. It requires a sufficient knowledge ofman’s characteristics and of the characteristics of other animals todifferentiate man from other animals, and to differentiate animals from plantsor from inanimate objects.A widespread error, in this context, holds that the wider the concept, the lessits cognitive content—on the ground that its distinguishing characteristic ismore generalized than the distinguishing characteristics of its constituentconcepts. The error lies in assuming that a concept consists of nothing but itsdistinguishing characteristic. But the fact is that in the process ofabstracting from abstractions, one cannot know what is a distinguishingcharacteristic unless one has observed other characteristics of the unitsinvolved and of the existents from which they are differentiated.Just as the concept “man” does not consist merely of “rational faculty” (if itdid, the two would be equivalent and interchangeable, which they are not), butincludes all the characteristics of “man,” with “rational faculty” serving asthe distinguishing characteristic—so, in the case of wider concepts, the concept“animal” does not consist merely of “consciousness and locomotion,” but subsumesall the characteristics of all the animal species, with “consciousness andlocomotion” serving as the distinguishing characteristic. (We shall discuss thisfurther when we discuss definitions.)An error of that kind is possible only on the basis of assuming that man learnsconcepts by memorizing their definitions, i.e., on the basis of studying theepistemology of a parrot. But that is not what we are here studying. To grasp aconcept is to grasp and, in part, to retrace the process by which it was formed.To retrace that process is to grasp at least some of the units which it subsumes(and thus to link one’s understanding of the concept to the facts of reality).Just as wider integrations of concepts require a more extensive knowledge, sonarrower subdivisions of concepts require a more intensive knowledge. Forinstance, the concept “father” requires more knowledge than the concept“man”—since it requires knowledge of man, of the act of reproduction, and of theconsequent relationship.2. The formation of a concept provides man with the means of identifying, notonly the concretes he has observed, but all the concretes of that kind which hemay encounter in the future. Thus, when he has formed or grasped the concept“man,” he does not have to regard every man he meets thereafter as a newphenomenon to be studied from scratch: he identifies him as “man” and applies tohim the knowledge he has acquired about man (which leaves him free to study theparticular, individual characteristics of the newcomer, i.e., the individualmeasurements within the categories established by the concept “man”).This process of conceptual identification (of subsuming a new concrete under anappropriate concept) is learned as one learns to speak, and it becomes automaticin the case of existents given in perceptual awareness, such as “man,” “table,”“blue,” “length,” etc. But it grows progressively more difficult as man’sconcepts move farther away from direct perceptual evidence, and involve complexcombinations and cross-classifications of many earlier concepts. (Observe thedifficulties of identifying a given political system, or of diagnosing a raredisease.) In such cases, the knowledge of whether a concrete is or is not to besubsumed under a certain concept does not come automatically, but requires a newcognitive effort.Thus the process of forming and applying concepts contains the essential patternof two fundamental methods of cognition: induction and deduction.The process of observing the facts of reality and of integrating them intoconcepts is, in essence, a process of induction. The process of subsuming newinstances under a known concept is, in essence, a process of deduction."},{"pageContent":"4.Concepts of ConsciousnessConsciousness is the faculty of awareness—the faculty of perceiving that whichexists.Awareness is not a passive state, but an active process. On the lower levels ofawareness, a complex neurological process is required to enable man toexperience a sensation and to integrate sensations into percepts; that processis automatic and non-volitional: man is aware of its results, but not of theprocess itself. On the higher, conceptual level, the process is psychological,conscious and volitional. In either case, awareness is achieved and maintainedby continuous action.Directly or indirectly, every phenomenon of consciousness is derived from one’sawareness of the external world. Some object, i.e., some content, is involved inevery state of awareness. Extrospection is a process of cognition directedoutward—a process of apprehending some existent(s) of the external world.Introspection is a process of cognition directed inward—a process ofapprehending one’s own psychological actions in regard to some existent(s) ofthe external world, such actions as thinking, feeling, reminiscing, etc. It isonly in relation to the external world that the various actions of aconsciousness can be experienced, grasped, defined or communicated. Awareness isawareness of something. A content-less state of consciousness is a contradictionin terms.Two fundamental attributes are involved in every state, aspect or function ofman’s consciousness: content and action—the content of awareness, and the actionof consciousness in regard to that content.These two attributes are the fundamental Conceptual Common Denominator of allconcepts pertaining to consciousness.On the perceptual level of awareness, a child merely experiences and performsvarious psychological processes; his full conceptual development requires thathe learn to conceptualize them (after he has reached a certain stage in hisextrospective conceptual development).To form concepts of consciousness, one must isolate the action from the contentof a given state of consciousness, by a process of abstraction. Just as,extrospectively, man can abstract attributes from entities—so, introspectively,he can abstract the actions of his consciousness from its contents, and observethe differences among these various actions.For instance (on the adult level), when a man sees a woman walking down thestreet, the action of his consciousness is perception; when he notes that she isbeautiful, the action of his consciousness is evaluation; when he experiences aninner state of pleasure and approval, of admiration, the action of hisconsciousness is emotion; when he stops to watch her and draws conclusions, fromthe evidence, about her character, age, social position, etc., the action of hisconsciousness is thought; when, later, he recalls the incident, the action ofhis consciousness is reminiscence; when he projects that her appearance would beimproved if her hair were blond rather than brown, and her dress were bluerather than red, the action of his consciousness is imagination.He can also observe the similarities among the actions of his consciousness onvarious occasions, by observing the fact that these same actions—in differentsequences, combinations and degrees—are, have been or can be applicable to otherobjects: to a man, a dog, an automobile, or the entire street; to the reading ofa book, the learning of a new skill, the choice of a job, or to any objectwithin the scope of his awareness.Such is the pattern of the process by which (in slower, gradual steps) manlearns to form concepts of consciousness.In the realm of introspection, the concretes, the units which are integratedinto a single concept, are the specific instances of a given psychologicalprocess. The measurable attributes of a psychological process are its object orcontent and its intensity.The content is some aspect of the external world (or is derived from some aspectof the external world) and is measurable by the various methods of measurementapplicable to the external world. The intensity of a psychological process isthe automatically summed up result of many factors: of its scope, its clarity,its cognitive and motivational context, the degree of mental energy or effortrequired, etc.There is no exact method of measuring the intensity of all psychologicalprocesses, but—as in the case of forming concepts of colors—conceptualizationdoes not require the knowledge of exact measurements. Degrees of intensity canbe and are measured approximately, on a comparative scale. For instance, theintensity of the emotion of joy in response to certain facts varies according tothe importance of these facts in one’s hierarchy of values; it varies in suchcases as buying a new suit, or getting a raise in pay, or marrying the personone loves. The intensity of a process of thought and of the intellectual effortrequired varies according to the scope of its content; it varies when one graspsthe concept “table” or the concept “justice,” when one grasps that 2 + 2 = 4 orthat e = mc2.The formation of introspective concepts follows the same principles as theformation of extrospective concepts. A concept pertaining to consciousness is amental integration of two or more instances of a psychological processpossessing the same distinguishing characteristics, with the particular contentsand the measurements of the action’s intensity omitted—on the principle thatthese omitted measurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in anyquantity (i.e., a given psychological process must possess some content and somedegree of intensity, but may possess any content or degree of the appropriatecategory).For instance, the concept “thought” is formed by retaining the distinguishingcharacteristics of the psychological action (a purposefully directed process ofcognition) and by omitting the particular contents as well as the degree of theintellectual effort’s intensity. The concept “emotion” is formed by retainingthe distinguishing characteristics of the psychological action (an automaticresponse proceeding from an evaluation of an existent) and by omitting theparticular contents (the existents) as well as the degree of emotionalintensity.Now observe that I have mentioned the terms scope and hierarchy in connectionwith the intensity of psychological processes. These are terms that belong tothe category of measurements—and they indicate more precise methods of measuringsome psychological phenomena.In regard to the concepts pertaining to cognition (“thought,” “observation,”“reasoning,” “learning,” etc.), the scope of the content provides a method ofmeasurement. The scope is gauged by two interrelated aspects: by the scope ofthe factual material involved in a given cognitive process, and by the length ofthe conceptual chain required to deal with that material. Since concepts have ahierarchical structure, i.e., since the higher, more complex abstractions arederived from the simpler, basic ones (starting with the concepts of perceptuallygiven concretes), the distance from the perceptual level of the concepts used ina given cognitive process indicates the scope of that process. (The level ofabstraction with which a man is able to deal indicates how much he had to knowin order to reach that level. I am not speaking here of men who mouth memorizedfloating abstractions, but only of those who actually grasp all the stepsinvolved.)In regard to the concepts pertaining to evaluation (“value,” “emotion,”“feeling,” “desire,” etc.), the hierarchy involved is of a different kind andrequires an entirely different type of measurement. It is a type applicable onlyto the psychological process of evaluation, and may be designated as“teleological measurement. ”Measurement is the identification of a relationship—a quantitative relationshipestablished by means of a standard that serves as a unit. Teleologicalmeasurement deals, not with cardinal, but with ordinal numbers—and the standardserves to establish a graded relationship of means to end.For instance, a moral code is a system of teleological measurement which gradesthe choices and actions open to man, according to the degree to which theyachieve or frustrate the code’s standard of value. The standard is the end, towhich man’s actions are the means.A moral code is a set of abstract principles; to practice it, an individual musttranslate it into the appropriate concretes —he must choose the particular goalsand values which he is to pursue. This requires that he define his particularhierarchy of values, in the order of their importance, and that he actaccordingly. Thus all his actions have to be guided by a process of teleologicalmeasurement. (The degree of uncertainty and contradictions in a man’s hierarchyof values is the degree to which he will be unable to perform such measurementsand will fail in his attempts at value calculations or at purposeful action.)Teleological measurement has to be performed in and against an enormous context:it consists of establishing the relationship of a given choice to all the otherpossible choices and to one’s hierarchy of values.The simplest example of this process, which all men practice (with variousdegrees of precision and success), may be seen in the realm of materialvalues—in the (implicit) principles that guide a man’s spending of money. On anylevel of income, a man’s money is a limited quantity; in spending it, he weighsthe value of his purchase against the value of every other purchase open to himfor the same amount of money, he weighs it against the hierarchy of all hisother goals, desires and needs, then makes the purchase or not accordingly.The same kind of measurement guides man’s actions in the wider realm of moral orspiritual values. (By “spiritual” I mean “pertaining to consciousness.” I say“wider” because it is man’s hierarchy of values in this realm that determineshis hierarchy of values in the material or economic realm.) But the currency ormedium of exchange is different. In the spiritual realm, the currency—whichexists in limited quantity and must be teleologically measured in the pursuit ofany value—is time, i.e., one’s life.Since a value is that which one acts to gain and/or keep, and the amount ofpossible action is limited by the duration of one’s lifespan, it is a part ofone’s life that one invests in everything one values. The years, months, days orhours of thought, of interest, of action devoted to a value are the currencywith which one pays for the enjoyment one receives from it.Now let us answer the question: “Can you measure love?”The concept “love” is formed by isolating two or more instances of theappropriate psychological process, then retaining its distinguishingcharacteristics (an emotion proceeding from the evaluation of an existent as apositive value and as a source of pleasure) and omitting the object and themeasurements of the process’s intensity.The object may be a thing, an event, an activity, a condition or a person. Theintensity varies according to one’s evaluation of the object, as, for instance,in such cases as one’s love for ice cream, or for parties, or for reading, orfor freedom, or for the person one marries. The concept “love” subsumes a vastrange of values and, consequently, of intensity: it extends from the lowerlevels (designated by the sub-category “liking”) to the higher level (designatedby the sub-category “affection,” which is applicable only in regard to persons)to the highest level, which includes romantic love.If one wants to measure the intensity of a particular instance of love, one doesso by reference to the hierarchy of values of the person experiencing it. A manmay love a woman, yet may rate the neurotic satisfactions of sexual promiscuityhigher than her value to him. Another man may love a woman, but may give her up,rating his fear of the disapproval of others (of his family, his friends or anyrandom strangers) higher than her value. Still another man may risk his life tosave the woman he loves, because all his other values would lose meaning withouther. The emotions in these examples are not emotions of the same intensity ordimension. Do not let a James Taggart type of mystic tell you that love isimmeasurable.Certain categories of concepts of consciousness require special consideration.These are concepts pertaining to the products of psychological processes, suchas “knowledge,” “science,” “idea,” etc.These concepts are formed by retaining their distinguishing characteristics andomitting their content. For instance, the concept “knowledge” is formed byretaining its distinguishing characteristics (a mental grasp of a fact(s) ofreality, reached either by perceptual observation or by a process of reasonbased on perceptual observation) and omitting the particular fact(s) involved.The intensity of the psychological processes which led to the products isirrelevant here, but the nature of these processes is included in thedistinguishing characteristics of the concepts, and serves to differentiate thevarious concepts of this kind.It is important to note that these concepts are not the equivalent of theirexistential content—and that they belong to the category of epistemologicalconcepts, with their metaphysical component regarded as their content. Forinstance, the concept “the science of physics” is not the same thing as thephysical phenomena which are the content of the science. The phenomena existindependent of man’s knowledge ; the science is an organized body of knowledgeabout these phenomena, acquired by and communicable to a human consciousness.The phenomena would continue to exist, even if no human consciousness remainedin existence; the science would not.A special sub-category of concepts pertaining to the products of consciousness,is reserved for concepts of method. Concepts of method designate systematiccourses of action devised by men for the purpose of achieving certain goals. Thecourse of action may be purely psychological (such as a method of using one’sconsciousness) or it may involve a combination of psychological and physicalactions (such as a method of drilling for oil), according to the goal to beachieved.Concepts of method are formed by retaining the distinguishing characteristics ofthe purposive course of action and of its goal, while omitting the particularmeasurements of both.For instance, the fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the othersdepend, is logic. The distinguishing characteristic of logic (the art ofnon-contradictory identification) indicates the nature of the actions (actionsof consciousness required to achieve a correct identification) and their goal(knowledge)—white omitting the length, complexity or specific steps of theprocess of logical inference, as well as the nature of the particular cognitiveproblem involved in any given instance of using logic.Concepts of method represent a large part of man’s conceptual equipment.Epistemology is a science devoted to the discovery of the proper methods ofacquiring and validating knowledge. Ethics is a science devoted to the discoveryof the proper methods of living one’s life. Medicine is a science devoted to thediscovery of the proper methods of curing disease. All the applied sciences(i.e., technology) are sciences devoted to the discovery of methods.The concepts of method are the link to the vast and complex category of conceptsthat represent integrations of existential concepts with concepts ofconsciousness, a category that includes most of the concepts pertaining to man’sactions. Concepts of this category have no direct referents on the perceptuallevel of awareness (though they include perceptual components) and can neitherbe formed nor grasped without a long antecedent chain of concepts.For instance, the concept “marriage” denotes a certain moral-legal relationshipbetween a man and a woman, which entails a certain pattern of behavior, based ona mutual agreement and sanctioned by law. The concept “marriage” cannot beformed or grasped merely by observing the behavior of a couple: it requires theintegration of their actions with a number of concepts of consciousness, such as“contractual agreement,” “morality” and “law.”The concept “property” denotes the relationship of a man to an object (or anidea): his right to use it and to dispose of it—and involves a long chain ofmoral-legal concepts, including the procedure by which the object was acquired.The mere observation of a man in the act of using an object will not convey theconcept “property.”Composite concepts of this kind are formed by isolating the appropriateexistents, relationships and actions, then retaining their distinguishingcharacteristics and omitting the type of measurements appropriate to the variouscategories of concepts involved.Now a word about grammar. Grammar is a science dealing with the formulation ofthe proper methods of verbal expression and communication, i.e., the methods oforganizing words (concepts) into sentences. Grammar pertains to the actions ofconsciousness, and involves a number of special concepts—such as conjunctions,which are concepts denoting relationships among thoughts (“and,” “but,” “or,”etc.). These concepts are formed by retaining the distinguishing characteristicsof the relationship and omitting the particular thoughts involved. The purposeof conjunctions is verbal economy: they serve to integrate and/or condense thecontent of certain thoughts.For instance, the word “and” serves to integrate a number of facts into onethought. If one says: “Smith, Jones and Brown are walking,” the “and” indicatesthat the observation “are walking” applies to the three individuals named. Isthere an object in reality corresponding to the word “and”? No. Is there a factin reality corresponding to the word “and”? Yes. The fact is that three men arewalking—and that the word “and” integrates into one thought a fact whichotherwise would have to be expressed by: “Smith is walking. Jones is walking.Brown is walking.”The word “but” serves to indicate an exception to or a contradiction of thepossible implications of a given thought.If one says: “She is beautiful, but dumb,” the “but” serves to condense thefollowing thoughts: “This girl is beautiful. Beauty is a positive attribute, avalue. Before you conclude that this girl is valuable, you must consider alsoher negative attribute: she is dumb.” If one says: “I work every day, but not onSunday,” the “but” indicates an exception and condenses the following: “I workon Monday. I work on Tuesday. (And so on, four more times.) My activity onSunday is different: I do not work on Sunday.”(These examples are for the benefit of those victims of modern philosophy whoare taught by Linguistic Analysis that there is no way to derive conjunctionsfrom experience, i.e., from the facts of reality.)A certain aspect of the epistemological state of today’s culture is worth notingat this point.Observe that the attacks on the conceptual level of man’s consciousness, i.e.,on reason, come from the same ideological quarters as the attacks onmeasurement. When discussing man’s consciousness, particularly his emotions,some persons use the word “measurement” as a pejorative term—as if an attempt toapply it to the phenomena of consciousness were a gross, insulting,“materialistic” impropriety. The question “Can you measure love?” is an exampleand a symptom of that attitude.As in many other issues, the two allegedly opposite camps are merely twovariants growing out of the same basic premises. The old-fashioned mysticsproclaim that you cannot measure love in pounds, inches or dollars. They areaided and abetted by the neo-mystics who—punch-drunk with undigested concepts ofmeasurement, proclaiming measurement to be the sole tool of science—proceed tomeasure knee-jerks, statistical questionnaires, and the learning time of rats,as indices to the human psyche.Both camps fail to observe that measurement requires an appropriate standard,and that in the physical sciences—which one camp passionately hates, and theother passionately envies—one does not measure length in pounds, or weight ininches.Measurement is the identification of a relationship in numerical terms—and thecomplexity of the science of measurement indicates the complexity of therelationships which exist in the universe and which man has barely begun toinvestigate. They exist, even if the appropriate standards and methods ofmeasurement are not always as easily apparent nor the degree of achievableprecision as great as in the case of measuring the basic, perceptually givenattributes of matter. If anything were actually “immeasurable,” it would bear norelationship of any kind to the rest of the universe, it would not affect nor beaffected by anything else in any manner whatever, it would enact no causes andbear no consequences—in short, it would not exist.The motive of the anti-measurement attitude is obvious: it is the desire topreserve a sanctuary of the indeterminate for the benefit of the irrational—thedesire, epistemologically, to escape from the responsibility of cognitiveprecision and wide-scale integration; and, metaphysically, the desire to escapefrom the absolutism of existence, of facts, of reality and, above all, ofidentity."},{"pageContent":"5.DefinitionsA definition is a statement that identifies the nature of the units subsumedunder a concept.It is often said that definitions state the meaning of words. This is true, butit is not exact. A word is merely a visual-auditory symbol used to represent aconcept; a word has no meaning other than that of the concept it symbolizes, andthe meaning of a concept consists of its units. It is not words, but conceptsthat man defines—by specifying their referents.The purpose of a definition is to distinguish a concept from all other conceptsand thus to keep its units differentiated from all other existents.Since the definition of a concept is formulated in terms of other concepts, itenables man, not only to identify and retain a concept, but also to establishthe relationships, the hierarchy, the integration of all his concepts and thusthe integration of his knowledge. Definitions preserve, not the chronologicalorder in which a given man may have learned concepts, but the logical order oftheir hierarchical interdependence.With certain significant exceptions, every concept can be defined andcommunicated in terms of other concepts. The exceptions are concepts referringto sensations, and metaphysical axioms.Sensations are the primary material of consciousness and, therefore, cannot becommunicated by means of the material which is derived from them. Theexistential causes of sensations can be described and defined in conceptualterms (e.g., the wavelengths of light and the structure of the human eye, whichproduce the sensations of color), but one cannot communicate what color is like,to a person who is born blind. To define the meaning of the concept “blue,” forinstance, one must point to some blue objects to signify, in effect: “I meanthis.” Such an identification of a concept is known as an “ostensivedefinition.”Ostensive definitions are usually regarded as applicable only to conceptualizedsensations. But they are applicable to axioms as well. Since axiomatic conceptsare identifications of irreducible primaries, the only way to define one is bymeans of an ostensive definition—e.g., to define “existence,” one would have tosweep one’s arm around and say: “I mean this.” (We shall discuss axioms later.)The rules of correct definition are derived from the process ofconcept-formation. The units of a concept were differentiated—by means of adistinguishing characteristic(s)—from other existents possessing a commensurablecharacteristic, a “Conceptual Common Denominator.” A definition follows the sameprinciple: it specifies the distinguishing characteristic (s) of the units, andindicates the category of existents from which they were differentiated.The distinguishing characteristic(s) of the units becomes the differentia of theconcept’s definition; the existents possessing a “Conceptual Common Denominator”become the genus.Thus a definition complies with the two essential functions of consciousness:differentiation and integration. The differentia isolates the units of a conceptfrom all other existents; the genus indicates their connection to a wider groupof existents.For instance, in the definition of table (“An item of furniture, consisting of aflat, level surface and supports, intended to support other, smaller objects”),the specified shape is the differentia, which distinguishes tables from theother entities belonging to the same genus: furniture. In the definition of man(“A rational animal”), “rational” is the differentia, “animal” is the genus.Just as a concept becomes a unit when integrated with others into a widerconcept, so a genus becomes a single unit, a species, when integrated withothers into a wider genus. For instance, “table” is a species of the genus“furniture,” which is a species of the genus “household goods,” which is aspecies of the genus “man-made objects.” “Man” is a species of the genus“animal,” which is a species of the genus “organism,” which is a species of thegenus “entity.”A definition is not a description; it implies, but does not mention all thecharacteristics of a concept’s units. If a definition were to list all thecharacteristics, it would defeat its own purpose: it would provide anindiscriminate, undifferentiated and, in effect, pre-conceptual conglomerationof characteristics which would not serve to distinguish the units from all otherexistents, nor the concept from all other concepts. A definition must identifythe nature of the units, i.e., the essential characteristics without which theunits would not be the kind of existents they are. But it is important toremember that a definition implies all the characteristics of the units, sinceit identifies their essential, not their exhaustive, characteristics; since itdesignates existents, not their isolated aspects; and since it is a condensationof, not a substitute for, a wider knowledge of the existents involved.This leads to a crucial question: since a group of existents may possess morethan one characteristic distinguishing them from other existents, how does onedetermine the essential characteristic of an existent and, therefore, the properdefining characteristic of a concept?The answer is provided by the process of concept-formation.Concepts are not and cannot be formed in a vacuum; they are formed in a context;the process of conceptualization consists of observing the differences andsimilarities of the existents within the field of one’s awareness (andorganizing them into concepts accordingly). From a child’s grasp of the simplestconcept integrating a group of perceptually given concretes, to a scientist’sgrasp of the most complex abstractions integrating long conceptual chains—allconceptualization is a contextual process; the context is the entire field of amind’s awareness or knowledge at any level of its cognitive development.This does not mean that conceptualization is a subjective process or that thecontent of concepts depends on an individual’s subjective (i.e., arbitrary)choice. The only issue open to an individual’s choice in this matter is how muchknowledge he will seek to acquire and, consequently, what conceptual complexityhe will be able to reach. But so long as and to the extent that his mind dealswith concepts (as distinguished from memorized sounds and floatingabstractions), the content of his concepts is determined and dictated by thecognitive content of his mind, i.e., by his grasp of the facts of reality. Ifhis grasp is non-contradictory, then even if the scope of his knowledge ismodest and the content of his concepts is primitive, it will not contradict thecontent of the same concepts in the mind of the most advanced scientists.The same is true of definitions. All definitions are contextual, and a primitivedefinition does not contradict a more advanced one: the latter merely expandsthe former.As an example, let us trace the development of the concept “man.”On the pre-verbal level of awareness, when a child first learns to differentiatemen from the rest of his perceptual field, he observes distinguishingcharacteristics which, if translated into words, would amount to a definitionsuch as: “A thing that moves and makes sounds.” Within the context of hisawareness, this is a valid definition: man, in fact, does move and make sounds,and this distinguishes him from the inanimate objects around him.When the child observes the existence of cats, dogs and automobiles, hisdefinition ceases to be valid: it is still true that man moves and makes sounds,but these characteristics do not distinguish him from other entities in thefield of the child’s awareness. The child’s (wordless) definition then changesto some equivalent of: “A living thing that walks on two legs and has no fur,”with the characteristics of “moving and making sounds” remaining implicit, butno longer defining. Again, this definition is valid—within the context of thechild’s awareness.When the child learns to speak and the field of his awareness expands stillfurther, his definition of man expands accordingly. It becomes something like:“A living being that speaks and does things no other living beings can do.”This type of definition will suffice for a long time (a great many men, somemodern scientists among them, never progress beyond some variant of thisdefinition). But this ceases to be valid at about the time of the child’sadolescence, when he observes (if his conceptual development continues) that hisknowledge of the “things no other living beings can do” has grown to anenormous, incoherent, unexplained collection of activities, some of which areperformed by all men, but some are not, some of which are even performed byanimals (such as building shelters), but in some significantly different manner,etc. He realizes that his definition is neither applicable equally to all men,nor does it serve to distinguish men from all other living beings.It is at this stage that he asks himself: What is the common characteristic ofall of man’s varied activities? What is their root? What capacity enables man toperform them and thus distinguishes him from all other animals? When he graspsthat man’s distinctive characteristic is his type of consciousness—aconsciousness able to abstract, to form concepts, to apprehend reality by aprocess of reason—he reaches the one and only valid definition of man, withinthe context of his knowledge and of all of mankind’s knowledge to date: “Arational animal. ”(“Rational,” in this context, does not mean “acting invariably in accordancewith reason”; it means “possessing the faculty of reason.” A full biologicaldefinition of man would include many sub-categories of “animal,” but the generalcategory and the ultimate definition remain the same.)Observe that all of the above versions of a definition of man were true, i.e.,were correct identifications of the facts of reality—and that they were validqua definitions, i.e., were correct selections of distinguishing characteristicsin a given context of knowledge. None of them was contradicted by subsequentknowledge: they were included implicitly, as non-defining characteristics, in amore precise definition of man. It is still true that man is a rational animalwho speaks, does things no other living beings can do, walks on two legs, has nofur, moves and makes sounds.The specific steps given in this example are not necessarily the literal stepsof the conceptual development of every man, there may be many more steps (orfewer), they may not be as clearly and consciously delimited—but this is thepattern of development which most concepts and definitions undergo in a man’smind with the growth of his knowledge. It is the pattern which makes intensivestudy and, therefore, the growth of knowledge—and of science— possible.Now observe, on the above example, the process of determining an essentialcharacteristic: the rule of fundamentality. When a given group of existents hasmore than one characteristic distinguishing it from other existents, man mustobserve the relationships among these various characteristics and discover theone on which all the others (or the greatest number of others) depend, i.e., thefundamental characteristic without which the others would not be possible. Thisfundamental characteristic is the essential distinguishing characteristic of theexistents involved, and the proper defining characteristic of the concept.Metaphysically, a fundamental characteristic is that distinctive characteristicwhich makes the greatest number of others possible; epistemologically, it is theone that explains the greatest number of others.For instance, one could observe that man is the only animal who speaks English,wears wristwatches, flies airplanes, manufactures lipstick, studies geometry,reads newspapers, writes poems, darns socks, etc. None of these is an essentialcharacteristic: none of them explains the others; none of them applies to allmen; omit any or all of them, assume a man who has never done any of thesethings, and he will still be a man. But observe that all these activities (andinnumerable others) require a conceptual grasp of reality, that an animal wouldnot be able to understand them, that they are the expressions and consequencesof man’s rational faculty, that an organism without that faculty would not be aman—and you will know why man’s rational faculty is his essential distinguishingand defining characteristic.If definitions are contextual, how does one determine an objective definitionvalid for all men? It is determined according to the widest context of knowledgeavailable to man on the subjects relevant to the units of a given concept.Objective validity is determined by reference to the facts of reality. But it isman who has to identify the facts; objectivity requires discovery by man—andcannot precede man’s knowledge, i.e., cannot require omniscience. Man cannotknow more than he has discovered—and he may not know less than the evidenceindicates, if his concepts and definitions are to be objectively valid.In this issue, an ignorant adult is in the same position as a child oradolescent. He has to act within the scope of such knowledge as he possesses andof his correspondingly primitive conceptual definitions. When he moves into awider field of action and thought, when new evidence confronts him, he has toexpand his definitions according to the evidence, if they are to be objectivelyvalid.An objective definition, valid for all men, is one that designates the essentialdistinguishing characteristic(s) and genus of the existents subsumed under agiven concept—according to all the relevant knowledge available at that stage ofmankind’s development.(Who decides, in case of disagreements? As in all issues pertaining toobjectivity, there is no ultimate authority, except reality and the mind ofevery individual who judges the evidence by the objective method of judgment:logic.)This does not mean that every man has to be a universal scholar and that everydiscovery of science affects the definitions of concepts: when science discoverssome previously unknown aspects of reality, it forms new concepts to identifythem (e.g., “electron”); but insofar as science is concerned with the intensivestudy of previously known and conceptualized existents, its discoveries areidentified by means of conceptual sub-categories. For instance, man isclassified biologically in several sub-categories of “animal,” such as “mammal,”etc. But this does not alter the fact that rationality is his essentialdistinguishing and defining characteristic, and that “animal” is the wider genusto which he belongs. (And it does not alter the fact that when a scientist andan illiterate use the concept “man,” they are referring to the same kind ofentities.)Only when and if some discovery were to make the definition “rational animal”inaccurate (i.e., no longer serving to distinguish man from all other existents)would the question of expanding the definition arise. “Expanding” does not meannegating, abrogating or contradicting; it means demonstrating that some othercharacteristics are more distinctive of man than rationality and animality—inwhich unlikely case these two would be regarded as non-defining characteristics,but would still remain true.Remember that concept-formation is a method of cognition, man’s method, and thatconcepts represent classifications of observed existents according to theirrelationships to other observed existents. Since man is not omniscient, adefinition cannot be changelessly absolute, because it cannot establish therelationship of a given group of existents to everything else in the universe,including the undiscovered and unknown. And for the very same reasons, adefinition is false and worthless if it is not contextually absolute—if it doesnot specify the known relationships among existents (in terms of the knownessential characteristics) or if it contradicts the known (by omission orevasion).The nominalists of modern philosophy, particularly the logical positivists andlinguistic analysts, claim that the alternative of true or false is notapplicable to definitions, only to “factual” propositions. Since words, theyclaim, represent arbitrary human (social) conventions, and concepts have noobjective referents in reality, a definition can be neither true nor false. Theassault on reason has never reached a deeper level or a lower depth than this.Propositions consist of words—and the question of how a series of soundsunrelated to the facts of reality can produce a “factual” proposition orestablish a criterion of discrimination between truth and falsehood, is aquestion not worth debating. Nor can it be debated by means of inarticulatesounds that switch meanings at the whim of any speaker’s mood, stupor orexpediency of any given moment. (But the results of that notion can be observedin university classrooms, in the offices of psychiatrists, or on the front pagesof today’s newspapers.)Truth is the product of the recognition (i.e., identification) of the facts ofreality. Man identifies and integrates the facts of reality by means ofconcepts. He retains concepts in his mind by means of definitions. He organizesconcepts into propositions—and the truth or falsehood of his propositions rests,not only on their relation to the facts he asserts, but also on the truth orfalsehood of the definitions of the concepts he uses to assert them, which restson the truth or falsehood of his designations of essential characteristics.Every concept stands for a number of propositions. A concept identifyingperceptual concretes stands for some implicit propositions; but on the higherlevels of abstraction, a concept stands for chains and paragraphs and pages ofexplicit propositions referring to complex factual data. A definition is thecondensation of a vast body of observations—and stands or falls with the truthor falsehood of these observations. Let me repeat: a definition is acondensation. As a legal preamble (referring here to epistemological law), everydefinition begins with the implicit proposition: “After full consideration ofall the known facts pertaining to this group of existents, the following hasbeen demonstrated to be their essential, therefore defining, characteristic ...”In the light of this fact, consider some modern examples of proposeddefinitions. A noted anthropologist, writing in a national magazine, suggeststhat man’s essential distinction from all other animals, the essentialcharacteristic responsible for his unique development and achievements, is thepossession of a thumb. (The same article asserts that the dinosaur alsopossessed a thumb, but “somehow failed to develop.”) What about man’s type ofconsciousness? Blank out.An article in a reputable encyclopedia suggests that man might be defined as “alanguage-having animal.” Is “language-having” a primary characteristic,independent of any other characteristic or faculty? Does language consist of theability to articulate sounds? If so, then parrots and myna-birds should beclassified as men. If they should not, then what human faculty do they lack?Blank out.There is no difference between such definitions and those chosen by individualswho define man as “a Christian (or Jewish or Mohammedan) animal” or “awhite-skinned animal” or “an animal of exclusively Aryan descent,” etc.—nodifference in epistemological principle or in practical consequences (or inpsychological motive).The truth or falsehood of all of man’s conclusions, inferences, thought andknowledge rests on the truth or falsehood of his definitions.(The above applies only to valid concepts. There are such things as invalidconcepts, i.e., words that represent attempts to integrate errors,contradictions or false propositions, such as concepts originating inmysticism—or words without specific definitions, without referents, which canmean anything to anyone, such as modern “anti-concepts.” Invalid concepts appearoccasionally in men’s languages, but are usually—though notnecessarily—short—lived, since they lead to cognitive dead-ends. An invalidconcept invalidates every proposition or process of thought in which it is usedas a cognitive assertion.)Above the level of conceptualized sensations and metaphysical axioms, everyconcept requires a verbal definition. Paradoxically enough, it is the simplestconcepts that most people find it hardest to define—the concepts of theperceptual concretes with which they deal daily, such as “table,” “house,”“man,” “walking,” “tall,” “number,” etc. There is a good reason for it: suchconcepts are, chronologically, the first concepts man forms or grasps, and canbe defined verbally only by means of later concepts—as, for instance, one graspsthe concept “table” long before one can grasp such concepts as “flat,” “level,”“surface,” “supports.” Most people, therefore, regard formal definitions asunnecessary and treat simple concepts as if they were pure sense data, to beidentified by means of ostensive definitions, i.e., simply by pointing.There is a certain psychological justification for this policy. Man’sdiscriminated awareness begins with percepts; the conceptual identifications ofdaily-observed percepts have become so thoroughly automatized in men’s mindsthat they seem to require no definitions—and men have no difficulty inidentifying the referents of such concepts ostensively.(This, incidentally, is one instance demonstrating the grotesque inversions ofLinguistic Analysis: the stock-in-trade of linguistic analysts consists ofreducing people to stammering helplessness by demanding that they define “house”or “which” or “but,” then proclaiming that since people cannot define even suchsimple words, they cannot be expected to define more complex ones, and,therefore, there can be no such things as definitions—or concepts.)In fact and in practice, so long as men are able to identify with full certaintythe perceptual referents of simple concepts, it is not necessary for them todevise or memorize the verbal definitions of such concepts. What is necessary isa knowledge of the rules by which the definitions can be formulated; and what isurgently necessary is a clear grasp of that dividing line beyond which ostensivedefinitions are no longer sufficient. (That dividing line begins at the pointwhere a man uses words with the feeling “I kinda know what I mean.”) Most peoplehave no grasp of that line and no inkling of the necessity to grasp it—and thedisastrous, paralyzing, stultifying consequences are the greatest single causeof mankind’s intellectual erosion.(As an illustration, observe what Bertrand Russell was able to perpetratebecause people thought they “kinda knew” the meaning of the concept “number”—andwhat the collectivists were able to perpetrate because people did not evenpretend to know the meaning of the concept “man.”)To know the exact meaning of the concepts one is using, one must know theircorrect definitions, one must be able to retrace the specific (logical, notchronological) steps by which they were formed, and one must be able todemonstrate their connection to their base in perceptual reality.When in doubt about the meaning or the definition of a concept, the best methodof clarification is to look for its referents—i.e., to ask oneself: What fact orfacts of reality gave rise to this concept? What distinguishes it from all otherconcepts?For instance: what fact of reality gave rise to the concept “justice”? The factthat man must draw conclusions about the things, people and events around him,i.e., must judge and evaluate them. Is his judgment automatically right? No.What causes his judgment to be wrong? The lack of sufficient evidence, or hisevasion of the evidence, or his inclusion of considerations other than the factsof the case. How, then, is he to arrive at the right judgment? By basing itexclusively on the factual evidence and by considering all the relevant evidenceavailable. But isn’t this a description of “objectivity”? Yes, “objectivejudgment” is one of the wider categories to which the concept “justice” belongs.What distinguishes “justice” from other instances of objective judgment? Whenone evaluates the nature or actions of inanimate objects, the criterion ofjudgment is determined by the particular purpose for which one evaluates them.But how does one determine a criterion for evaluating the character and actionsof men, in view of the fact that men possess the faculty of volition? Whatscience can provide an objective criterion of evaluation in regard to volitionalmatters? Ethics. Now, do I need a concept to designate the act of judging aman’s character and/or actions exclusively on the basis of all the factualevidence available, and of evaluating it by means of an objective moralcriterion? Yes. That concept is “justice.”Note what a long chain of considerations and observations is condensed into asingle concept. And the chain is much longer than the abbreviated patternpresented here—because every concept used in this example stands for similarchains.Please bear this example in mind. We shall discuss this issue further when wediscuss the cognitive role of concepts.Let us note, at this point, the radical difference between Aristotle’s view ofconcepts and the Objectivist view, particularly in regard to the issue ofessential characteristics.It is Aristotle who first formulated the principles of correct definition. It isAristotle who identified the fact that only concretes exist. But Aristotle heldthat definitions refer to metaphysical essences, which exist in concretes as aspecial element or formative power, and he held that the process ofconcept-formation depends on a kind of direct intuition by which man’s mindgrasps these essences and forms concepts accordingly.Aristotle regarded “essence” as metaphysical; Objectivism regards it asepistemological.Objectivism holds that the essence of a concept is that fundamentalcharacteristic(s) of its units on which the greatest number of othercharacteristics depend, and which distinguishes these units from all otherexistents within the field of man’s knowledge. Thus the essence of a concept isdetermined contextually and may be altered with the growth of man’s knowledge.The metaphysical referent of man’s concepts is not a special, separatemetaphysical essence, but the total of the facts of reality he has observed, andthis total determines which characteristics of a given group of existents hedesignates as essential. An essential characteristic is factual, in the sensethat it does exist, does determine other characteristics and does distinguish agroup of existents from all others; it is epistemological in the sense that theclassification of “essential characteristic” is a device of man’s method ofcognition—a means of classifying, condensing and integrating an ever-growingbody of knowledge.Now refer to the four historical schools of thought on the issue of concepts,which I listed in the foreword to this work—and observe that the dichotomy of“intrinsic or subjective” has played havoc with this issue, as it has with everyissue involving the relationship of consciousness to existence.The extreme realist (Platonist) and the moderate realist (Aristotelian) schoolsof thought regard the referents of concepts as intrinsic, i.e., as “universals”inherent in things (either as archetypes or as metaphysical essences), asspecial existents unrelated to man’s consciousness—to be perceived by mandirectly, like any other kind of concrete existents, but perceived by somenon-sensory or extra-sensory means.The nominalist and the conceptualist schools regard concepts as subjective,i.e., as products of man’s consciousness, unrelated to the facts of reality, asmere “names” or notions arbitrarily assigned to arbitrary groupings of concreteson the ground of vague, inexplicable resemblances.The extreme realist school attempts, in effect, to preserve the primacy ofexistence (of reality) by dispensing with consciousness—i.e., by convertingconcepts into concrete existents and reducing consciousness to the perceptuallevel, i.e., to the automatic function of grasping percepts (by supernaturalmeans, since no such percepts exist).The extreme nominalist (contemporary) school attempts to establish the primacyof consciousness by dispensing with existence (with reality)—i.e., by denyingthe status of existents even to concretes and converting concepts intoconglomerates of fantasy, constructed out of the debris of other, lesserfantasies, such as words without referents or incantations of soundscorresponding to nothing in an unknowable reality.To compound the chaos: it must be noted that the Platonist school begins byaccepting the primacy of consciousness, by reversing the relationship ofconsciousness to existence, by assuming that reality must conform to the contentof consciousness, not the other way around—on the premise that the presence ofany notion in man’s mind proves the existence of a corresponding referent inreality. But the Platonist school still retains some vestige of respect forreality, if only in unstated motivation: it distorts reality into a mysticalconstruct in order to extort its sanction and validate subjectivism. Thenominalist school begins, with empiricist humility, by negating the power ofconsciousness to form any valid generalizations about existence—and ends up witha subjectivism that requires no sanction, a consciousness freed from the“tyranny” of reality.None of these schools regards concepts as objective, i.e., as neither revealednor invented, but as produced by man’s consciousuess in accordance with thefacts of reality, as mental integrations of factual data computed by man—as theproducts of a cognitive method of classification whose processes must beperformed by man, but whose content is dictated by reality.It is as if, philosophically, mankind is still in the stage of transition whichcharacterizes a child in the process of learning to speak—a child who is usinghis conceptual faculty, but has not developed it sufficiently to be able toexamine it self-consciously and discover that what he is using is reason."},{"pageContent":"6.Axiomatic ConceptsAxioms are usually considered to be propositions identifying a fundamental,self-evident truth. But explicit propositions as such are not primaries: theyare made of concepts. The base of man’s knowledge—of all other concepts, allaxioms, propositions and thought—consists of axiomatic concepts.An axiomatic concept is the identification of a primary fact of reality, whichcannot be analyzed, i.e., reduced to other facts or broken into component parts.It is implicit in all facts and in all knowledge. It is the fundamentally givenand directly perceived or experienced, which requires no proof or explanation,but on which all proofs and explanations rest.The first and primary axiomatic concepts are “existence,” “identity” (which is acorollary of “existence”) and “consciousness.” One can study what exists and howconsciousness functions; but one cannot analyze (or “prove”) existence as such,or consciousness as such. These are irreducible primaries. (An attempt to“prove” them is self-contradictory: it is an attempt to “prove” existence bymeans of nonexistence, and consciousness by means of unconsciousness.)Existence, identity and consciousness are concepts in that they requireidentification in conceptual form. Their peculiarity lies in the fact that theyare perceived or experienced directly, but grasped conceptually. They areimplicit in every state of awareness, from the first sensation to the firstpercept to the sum of all concepts. After the first discriminated sensation (orpercept), man’s subsequent knowledge adds nothing to the basic facts designatedby the terms “existence,” “identity,” “consciousness”—these facts are containedin any single state of awareness; but what is added by subsequent knowledge isthe epistemological need to identify them consciously and self-consciously. Theawareness of this need can be reached only at an advanced stage of conceptualdevelopment, when one has acquired a sufficient volume of knowledge—and theidentification, the fully conscious grasp, can be achieved only by a process ofabstraction.It is not the abstraction of an attribute from a group of existents, but of abasic fact from all facts. Existence and identity are not attributes ofexistents, they are the existents. Consciousness is an attribute of certainliving entities, but it is not an attribute of a given state of awareness, it isthat state. Epistemologically, the formation of axiomatic concepts is an act ofabstraction, a selective focusing on and mental isolation of metaphysicalfundamentals; but metaphysically, it is an act of integration—the widestintegration possible to man: it unites and embraces the total of his experience.The units of the concepts “existence” and “identity” are every entity,attribute, action, event or phenomenon (including consciousness) that exists,has ever existed or will ever exist. The units of the concept “consciousness”are every state or process of awareness that one experiences, has everexperienced or will ever experience (as well as similar units, a similarfaculty, which one infers in other living entities). The measurements omittedfrom axiomatic concepts are all the measurements of all the existents theysubsume; what is retained, metaphysically, is only a fundamental fact; what isretained, epistemologically, is only one category of measurement, omitting itsparticulars: time—i.e., the fundamental fact is retained independent of anyparticular moment of awareness.Axiomatic concepts are the constants of man’s consciousness, the cognitiveintegrators that identify and thus protect its continuity. They identifyexplicitly the omission of psychological time measurements, which is implicit inall other concepts.It must be remembered that conceptual awareness is the only type of awarenesscapable of integrating past, present and future. Sensations are merely anawareness of the present and cannot be retained beyond the immediate moment;percepts are retained and, through automatic memory, provide a certainrudimentary link to the past, but cannot project the future. It is onlyconceptual awareness that can grasp and hold the total of itsexperience—extrospectively, the continuity of existence; introspectively, thecontinuity of consciousness—and thus enable its possessor to project his courselong-range. It is by means of axiomatic concepts that man grasps and holds thiscontinuity, bringing it into his conscious awareness and knowledge. It isaxiomatic concepts that identify the precondition of knowledge: the distinctionbetween existence and consciousness, between reality and the awareness ofreality, between the object and the subject of cognition. Axiomatic concepts arethe foundation of objectivity.Axiomatic concepts identify explicitly what is merely implicit in theconsciousness of an infant or of an animal. (Implicit knowledge is passivelyheld material which, to be grasped, requires a special focus and process ofconsciousness—a process which an infant learns to perform eventually, but whichan animal’s consciousness is unable to perform.)If the state of an animal’s perceptual awareness could be translated into words,it would amount to a disconnected succession of random moments such as “Here nowtable—here now tree—here now man—I now see—I now feel,” etc.—with the next dayor hour starting the succession all over again, with only a few strands ofmemory in the form of “This now food” or “This now master.” What a man’sconsciousness does with the same material, by means of axiomatic concepts, is:“The table exists—the tree exists—man exists—I am conscious.”(The above projection of an animal’s awareness is what certain modernphilosophers, such as logical positivists and logical atomists, ascribe to man,as his start and his only contact with reality—except that they reject theconcept “reality,” substitute sensations for percepts, and regard everythingabove this sub-animal level as an arbitrary human “construct.”)Since axiomatic concepts are not formed by differentiating one group ofexistents from others, but represent an integration of all existents, they haveno Conceptual Common Denominator with anything else. They have no contraries, noalternatives. The contrary of the concept “table”—a non-table-is every otherkind of existent. The contrary of the concept “man”—a non-man—is every otherkind of existent. “Existence,” “identity” and “consciousness” have nocontraries—only a void.It may be said that existence can be differentiated from non-existence; butnon-existence is not a fact, it is the absence of a fact, it is a derivativeconcept pertaining to a relationship, i.e., a concept which can be formed orgrasped only in relation to some existent that has ceased to exist. (One canarrive at the concept “absence” starting from the concept “presence,” in regardto some particular existent(s); one cannot arrive at the concept “presence”starting from the concept “absence,” with the absence including everything.)Non-existence as such is a zero with no sequence of numbers to follow it, it isthe nothing, the total blank.This gives us a lead to another special aspect of axiomatic concepts: althoughthey designate a fundamental metaphysical fact, axiomatic concepts are theproducts of an epistemological need—the need of a volitional, conceptualconsciousness which is capable of error and doubt. An animal’s perceptualawareness does not need and could not grasp an equivalent of the concepts“existence,” “identity” and “consciousness”: it deals with them constantly, itis aware of existents, it recognizes various identities, but it takes them (anditself) as the given and can conceive of no alternative. It is only man’sconsciousness, a consciousness capable of conceptual errors, that needs aspecial identification of the directly given, to embrace and delimit the entirefield of its awareness—to delimit it from the void of unreality to whichconceptual errors can lead. Axiomatic concepts are epistemological guidelines.They sum up the essence of all human cognition: something exists of which I amconscious; I must discover its identity.The concept “existence” does not indicate what existents it subsumes: it merelyunderscores the primary fact that they exist. The concept “identity” does notindicate the particular natures of the existents it subsumes: it merelyunderscores the primary fact that they are what they are. The concept“consciousness” does not indicate what existents one is conscious of: it merelyunderscores the primary fact that one is conscious.This underscoring of primary facts is one of the crucial epistemologicalfunctions of axiomatic concepts. It is also the reason why they can betranslated into a statement only in the form of a repetition (as a base and areminder): Existence exists—Consciousness is conscious—A is A. (This convertsaxiomatic concepts into formal axioms.)That special underscoring, which is of no concern to animals, is a matter oflife or death for man—as witness, modern philosophy, which is a monument to theresults of the attempt to evade or bypass such reminders.Since axiomatic concepts refer to facts of reality and are not a matter of“faith” or of man’s arbitrary choice, there is a way to ascertain whether agiven concept is axiomatic or not: one ascertains it by observing the fact thatan axiomatic concept cannot be escaped, that it is implicit in all knowledge,that it has to be accepted and used even in the process of any attempt to denyit.For instance, when modern philosophers declare that axioms are a matter ofarbitrary choice, and proceed to choose complex, derivative concepts as thealleged axioms of their alleged reasoning, one can observe that their statementsimply and depend on “existence,” “consciousness,” “identity,” which they professto negate, but which are smuggled into their arguments in the form ofunacknowledged, “stolen” concepts.It is worth noting, at this point, that what the enemies of reason seem to know,but its alleged defenders have not discovered, is the fact that axiomaticconcepts are the guardians of man’s mind and the foundation of reason—thekey-stone, touchstone and hallmark of reason—and if reason is to be destroyed,it is axiomatic concepts that have to be destroyed.Observe the fact that in the writings of every school of mysticism andirrationalism, amidst all the ponderously unintelligible verbiage ofobfuscations, rationalizations and equivocations (which include protestations offidelity to reason, and claims to some “higher” form of rationality), one finds,sooner or later, a clear, simple, explicit denial of the validity (of themetaphysical or ontological status) of axiomatic concepts, most frequently of“identity.” (For example, see the works of Kant and Hegel. ) You do not have toguess, infer or interpret: they tell you. But what you do have to know is thefull meaning, implications and consequences of such denials—which, in thehistory of philosophy, seem to be better understood by the enemies of reasonthan by its defenders.One of the consequences (a vulgar variant of concept stealing, prevalent amongavowed mystics and irrationalists) is a fallacy I call the Reification of theZero. It consists of regarding “nothing” as a thing, as a special, differentkind of existent. (For example, see Existentialism.) This fallacy breeds suchsymptoms as the notion that presence and absence, or being and non-being, aremetaphysical forces of equal power, and that being is the absence of non-being.E.g., “Nothingness is prior to being.” (Sartre)—“Human finitude is the presenceof the not in the being of man.” (William Barrett)—“Nothing is more real thannothing.” (Samuel Beckett)—“Das Nichts nichtet” or “Nothing noughts.”(Heidegger). “Consciousness, then, is not a stuff, but a negation. The subjectis not a thing, but a non-thing. The subject carves its own world out of Beingby means of negative determinations. Sartre describes consciousness as a‘noughting nought’ (néant néantisant). It is a form of being other than its own:a mode ‘which has yet to be what it is, that is to say, which is what it is,that is to say, which is what it is not and which is not what it is.’ ” (HectorHawton, The Feast of Unreason, London: Watts & Co., 1952, p. 162.)(The motive? “Genuine utterances about the nothing must always remain unusual.It cannot be made common. It dissolves when it is placed in the cheap acid ofmere logical acumen.” Heidegger.)A man’s protestations of loyalty to reason are meaningless as such: “reason” isnot an axiomatic, but a complex, derivative concept—and, particularly sinceKant, the philosophical technique of concept stealing, of attempting to negatereason by means of reason, has become a general bromide, a gimmick worntransparently thin. Do you want to assess the rationality of a person, a theoryor a philosophical system? Do not inquire about his or its stand on the validityof reason. Look for the stand on axiomatic concepts. It will tell the wholestory."},{"pageContent":"7.The Cognitive Role of ConceptsThe story of the following experiment was told in a university classroom by aprofessor of psychology. I cannot vouch for the validity of the specificnumerical conclusions drawn from it, since I could not check it first-hand. ButI shall cite it here, because it is the most illuminating way to illustrate acertain fundamental aspect of consciousness—of any consciousness, animal orhuman.The experiment was conducted to ascertain the extent of the ability of birds todeal with numbers. A hidden observer watched the behavior of a flock of crowsgathered in a clearing of the woods. When a man came into the clearing and wenton into the woods, the crows hid in the tree tops and would not come out untilhe returned and left the way he had come. When three men went into the woods andonly two returned, the crows would not come out: they waited until the third onehad left. But when five men went into the woods and only four returned, thecrows came out of hiding. Apparently, their power of discrimination did notextend beyond three units—and their perceptual-mathematical ability consisted ofa sequence such as: one-two-three-many.Whether this particular experiment is accurate or not, the truth of theprinciple it illustrates can be ascertained introspectively: if we omit allconceptual knowledge, including the ability to count in terms of numbers, andattempt to see how many units (or existents of a given kind) we candiscriminate, remember and deal with by purely perceptual means (e.g., visuallyor auditorially, but without counting), we will discover that the range of man’sperceptual ability may be greater, but not much greater, than that of the crow:we may grasp and hold five or six units at most.This fact is the best demonstration of the cognitive role of concepts.Since consciousness is a specific faculty, it has a specific nature or identityand, therefore, its range is limited: it cannot perceive everything at once;since awareness, on all its levels, requires an active process, it cannot doeverything at once. Whether the units with which one deals are percepts orconcepts, the range of what man can hold in the focus of his conscious awarenessat any given moment, is limited. The essence, therefore, of man’s incomparablecognitive power is the ability to reduce a vast amount of information to aminimal number of units—which is the task performed by his conceptual faculty.And the principle of unit-economy is one of that faculty’s essential guidingprinciples.Observe the operation of that principle in the field of mathematics. If theabove described experiment were performed on a man, instead of on crows, hewould be able to count and thus to remember a large number of men crossing theclearing (how large a number, would depend on the time available to perceivethem all and to count).A “number” is a mental symbol that integrates units into a single larger unit(or subdivides a unit into fractions) with reference to the basic number of“one,” which is the basic mental symbol of “unit.” Thus “5” stands for003[rand_9781101137208_oeb_003_r1.gif](Metaphysically, the referents of ”5” are anyfive existents of a specified kind; epistemologically, they are represented by asingle symbol.)Counting is an automatized, lightning-like process of reducing the number ofmental units one has to hold. In the process of counting—“one, two, three, four,etc.”—a man’s consciousness holds only one mental unit at any one moment, theparticular mental unit that represents the sum he has identified in reality(without having to retain the perceptual image of the existents composing thatsum). If he reaches, say, the sum of 25 (or 250), it is still a single unit,easy to remember and to deal with. But project the state of your ownconsciousness, if I now proceeded to give you that sum by means of perceptualunits, thus:004 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_004_r1.gif]... etc.Observe the principle of unit-economy in the structure of the decimal system,which demands of man’s mind that it hold only ten symbols (including the zero)and one simple rule of notation for larger numbers or fractions. Observe thealgebraic methods by which pages of complex calculations are reduced to asimple, single equation. Mathematics is a science of method (the science ofmeasurement i.e., of establishing quantitative relationships), a cognitivemethod that enables man to perform an unlimited series of integrations.Mathematics indicates the pattern of the cognitive role of concepts and thepsycho-epistemological need they fulfill. Conceptualization is a method ofexpanding man’s consciousness by reducing the number of its content’s units—asystematic means to an unlimited integration of cognitive data.A concept substitutes one symbol (one word) for the enormity of the perceptualaggregate of the concretes it subsumes. In order to perform its unit-reducingfunction, the symbol has to become automatized in a man’s consciousness, i.e.,the enormous sum of its referents must be instantly (implicitly) available tohis conscious mind whenever he uses that concept, without the need of perceptualvisualization or mental summarizing—in the same manner as the concept “5” doesnot require that he visualize five sticks every time he uses it.For example, if a man has fully grasped the concept “justice,” he does not needto recite to himself a long treatise on its meaning, while he listens to theevidence in a court case. The mere sentence “I must be just” holds that meaningin his mind automatically, and leaves his conscious attention free to grasp theevidence and to evaluate it according to a complex set of principles. (And, incase of doubt, the conscious recall of the precise meaning of “justice” provideshim with the guidelines he needs.)It is the principle of unit-economy that necessitates the definition of conceptsin terms of essential characteristics. If, when in doubt, a man recalls aconcept’s definition, the essential characterstic(s) will give him aninstantaneous grasp of the concept’s meaning, i.e., of the nature of itsreferents. For example, if he is considering some social theory and recalls that“man is a rational animal,” he will evaluate the validity of the theoryaccordingly; but if, instead, he recalls that “man is an animal possessing athumb,” his evaluation and conclusion will be quite different.Learning to speak is a process of automatizing the use (i.e., the meaning andthe application) of concepts. And more: all learning involves a process ofautomatizing, i.e., of first acquiring knowledge by fully conscious, focusedattention and observation, then of establishing mental connections which makethat knowledge automatic (instantly available as a context), thus freeing man’smind to pursue further, more complex knowledge.The status of automatized knowledge in his mind is experienced by man as if ithad the direct, effortless, self-evident quality (and certainty) of perceptualawareness. But it is conceptual knowledge—and its validity depends on theprecision of his concepts, which require as strict a precision of meaning (i.e.,as strict a knowledge of what specific referents they subsume) as thedefinitions of mathematical terms. (It is obvious what disasters will follow ifone automatizes errors, contradictions and undefined approximations.)This leads us to a crucial aspect of the cognitive role of concepts: conceptsrepresent condensations of knowledge, which make further study and the divisionof cognitive labor possible.Remember that the perceptual level of awareness is the base of man’s conceptualdevelopment. Man forms concepts, as a system of classification, whenever thescope of perceptual data becomes too great for his mind to handle. Conceptsstand for specific kinds of existents, including all the characteristics ofthese existents, observed and not-yet-observed, known and unknown.It is crucially important to grasp the fact that a concept is an “open-end”classification which includes the yet-to-be-discovered characteristics of agiven group of existents. All of man’s knowledge rests on that fact.The pattern is as follows: when a child grasps the concept “man,” the knowledgerepresented by that concept in his mind consists of perceptual data, such asman’s visual appearance, the sound of his voice, etc. When the child learns todifferentiate between living entities and inanimate matter, he ascribes a newcharacteristic, “living,” to the entity he designates as “man.” When the childlearns to differentiate among various types of consciousness, he includes a newcharacteristic in his concept of man, “rational”—and so on. The implicitprinciple guiding this process, is: “I know that there exists such an entity asman; I know many of his characteristics, but he has many others which I do notknow and must discover.” The same principle directs the study of every otherkind of perceptually isolated and conceptualized existents.The same principle directs the accumulation and transmission of mankind’sknowledge. From a savage’s knowledge of man, which was not much greater than achild’s, to the present level, when roughly half the sciences (the humanities)are devoted to the study of man, the concept “man” has not changed: it refers tothe same kind of entities. What has changed and grown is the knowledge of theseentities. The definitions of concepts may change with the changes in thedesignation of essential characteristics, and conceptual reclassifications mayoccur with the growth of knowledge, but these changes are made possible by anddo not alter the fact that a concept subsumes all the characteristics of itsreferents, including the yet-to-be-discovered.Since concepts represent a system of cognitive classification, a given conceptserves (speaking metaphorically) as a file folder in which man’s mind files hisknowledge of the existents it subsumes. The content of such folders varies fromindividual to individual, according to the degree of his knowledge—it rangesfrom the primitive, generalized information in the mind of a child or anilliterate to the enormously detailed sum in the mind of a scientist—but itpertains to the same referents, to the same kind of existents, and is subsumedunder the same concept. This filing system makes possible such activities aslearning, education, research—the accumulation, transmission and expansion ofknowledge. (It is the epistemological obligation of every individual to knowwhat his mental file contains in regard to any concept he uses, to keep itintegrated with his other mental files, and to seek further information when heneeds to check, correct or expand his knowledge.)The extent of today’s confusion about the nature of man’s conceptual faculty, iseloquently demonstrated by the following : it is precisely the “open-end”character of concepts, the essence of their cognitive function, that modernphilosophers cite in their attempts to demonstrate that concepts have nocognitive validity. “When can we claim that we know what a concept stands for?”they clamor—and offer, as an example of man’s predicament, the fact that one maybelieve all swans to be white, then discover the existence of a black swan andthus find one’s concept invalidated.This view implies the unadmitted presupposition that concepts are not acognitive device of man’s type of consciousness, but a repository of closed,out-of-context omniscience —and that concepts refer, not to the existents of theexternal world, but to the frozen, arrested state of knowledge inside any givenconsciousness at any given moment. On such a premise, every advance of knowledgeis a setback, a demonstration of man’s ignorance. For example, the savages knewthat man possesses a head, a torso, two legs and two arms; when the scientistsof the Renaissance began to dissect corpses and discovered the nature of man’sinternal organs, they invalidated the savages’ concept “man”; when modernscientists discovered that man possesses internal glands, they invalidated theRenaissance concept “man,” etc.Like a spoiled, disillusioned child, who had expected predigested capsules ofautomatic knowledge, a logical positivist stamps his foot at reality and criesthat context, integration, mental effort and first-hand inquiry are too much toexpect of him, that he rejects so demanding a method of cognition, and that hewill manufacture his own “constructs” from now on. (This amounts, in effect, tothe declaration: “Since the intrinsic has failed us, the subjective is our onlyalternative.”) The joke is on his listeners: it is this exponent of a primordialmystic’s craving for an effortless, rigid, automatic omniscience that modern mentake for an advocate of a free-flowing, dynamic, progressive science.It is the “open-end” character of concepts that permits the division ofcognitive labor among men. A scientist could not specialize in a particularbranch of study without a wider context, without the correlation and integrationof his work to the other aspects of the same subject. Consider, for example, thescience of medicine. If the concept “man” did not stand as the unifying conceptof that science (if some scientists studied only man’s lungs; others, only thestomach; still others, only the blood circulation; and still others, only theretina of the eye), if all new discoveries were not to be ascribed to the sameentity and, therefore, were not to be integrated in strict compliance with thelaw of non-contradiction, the collapse of medical science would not take long tofollow.No single mind can hold all the knowledge available to mankind today, let alonehold it in minute detail. Yet that knowledge has to be integrated and has to bekept open to individual understanding and verification, if science is not tocollapse under the weight of uncorrelated, unproved, contradictory minutiae.Only the most rigorous epistemological precision can implement and protect theadvance of science. Only the strictest, contextually absolute definitions ofconcepts, can enable men to integrate their knowledge, to keep expanding theirconceptual structure in severely hierarchical order by forming new concepts,when and as needed—and thus to condense information and to reduce the number ofmental units with which they have to deal.Instead, men are taught by the guardians of scientific epistemology, thephilosophers, that conceptual precision is impossible, that integration isundesirable, that concepts have no factual referents, that a concept denotesnothing but its defining characteristic, which represents nothing but anarbitrary social convention—and that a scientist should take public polls todiscover the meaning of the concepts he uses. (“Don’t look for the meaning, lookfor the use.”) The consequences of such doctrines are becoming apparent in everybranch of science today, most obviously in the humanities.Concepts represent a system of mental filing and cross-filing, so complex thatthe largest electronic computer is a child’s toy by comparison. This systemserves as the context, the frame-of-reference, by means of which man grasps andclassifies (and studies further) every existent he encounters and every aspectof reality. Language is the physical (visual-auditory) implementation of thissystem.Concepts and, therefore, language are primarily a tool of cognition—not ofcommunication, as is usually assumed. Communication is merely the consequence,not the cause nor the primary purpose of concept-formation—a crucialconsequence, of invaluable importance to men, but still only a consequence.Cognition precedes communication; the necessary precondition of communication isthat one have something to communicate. (This is true even of communicationamong animals, or of communication by grunts and growls among inarticulate men,let alone of communication by means of so complex and exacting a tool aslanguage.) The primary purpose of concepts and of language is to provide manwith a system of cognitive classification and organization, which enables him toacquire knowledge on an unlimited scale; this means: to keep order in man’s mindand enable him to think.Many kinds of existents are integrated into concepts and represented by specialwords, but many others are not and are identified only by means of verbaldescriptions. What determines man’s decision to integrate a given group ofexistents into a concept? The requirements of cognition (and the principle ofunit-economy).There is a great deal of latitude, on the periphery of man’s conceptualvocabulary, a broad area where the choice is optional, but in regard to certaincentral categories of existents the formation of concepts is mandatory. Thisincludes such categories as: (a) the perceptual concretes with which men dealdaily, represented by the first level of abstractions; (b) new discoveries ofscience; (c) new manmade objects which differ in their essential characteristicsfrom the previously known objects (e.g., “television”); (d) complex humanrelationships involving combinations of physical and psychological behavior(e.g., “marriage,” “law,” “justice”).These four categories represent existents with which men have to dealconstantly, in many different contexts, from many different aspects, either indaily physical action or, more crucially, in mental action and further study.The mental weight of carrying these existents in one’s head by means ofperceptual images or lengthy verbal descriptions is such that no human mindcould handle it. The need of condensation, of unit-reduction, is obvious in suchcases.For an example, I refer you to my brief analysis of the need to form the concept“justice” (in the chapter on “Definitions”). If that concept did not exist, whatnumber of considerations would a man have to bear in mind simultaneously, atevery step of the process of judging another man? Or if the concept “marriage”did not exist, what number of considerations would a man have to bear in mindand express, when proposing to a woman? (Ask yourself what that concept subsumesand condenses in your own mind.)The descriptive complexity of a given group of existents, the frequency of theiruse, and the requirements of cognition (of further study) are the main reasonsfor the formation of new concepts. Of these reasons, the requirements ofcognition are the paramount one.The requirements of cognition forbid the arbitrary grouping of existents, bothin regard to isolation and to integration. They forbid the random coining ofspecial concepts to designate any and every group of existents with any possiblecombination of characteristics. For example, there is no concept to designate“Beautiful blondes with blue eyes, 5’5” tall and 24 years old.” Such entities orgroupings are identified descriptively. If such a special concept existed, itwould lead to senseless duplication of cognitive effort (and to conceptualchaos): everything of significance discovered about that group would apply toall other young women as well. There would be no cognitive justification forsuch a concept—unless some essential characteristic were discovered,distinguishing such blondes from all other women and requiring special study, inwhich case a special concept would become necessary.(This is the reason why such conceptual subdivisions as “dining table,” “coffeetable,” etc. are not designated by special concepts, but are treated asqualified instances of the concept “tabte”—as mentioned in the chapter on“Abstraction from Abstractions.”)In the process of determining conceptual classification, neither the essentialsimilarities nor the essential differences among existents may be ignored,evaded or omitted once they have been observed. Just as the requirements ofcognition forbid the arbitrary subdivision of concepts, so they forbid thearbitrary integration of concepts into a wider concept by means of obliteratingtheir essential differences—which is an error (or falsification) proceeding fromdefinitions by non-essentials. (This is the method involved in the obliterationof valid concepts by means of “anti-concepts.”)For example, if one took the capacity to run as man’s essential characteristicand defined him as “a running animal,” the next step would be the attempt toeliminate “non-essential” distinctions and to form a single, higher-levelconcept out of “running entities,” such as a running man, a running river, arunning stocking, a running movie, a running commentary, etc. (on some suchgrounds as the notion that entities have no epistemological priority overactions). The result would be cognitive stultification and epistemologicaldisintegration.Cognitively, such an attempt would produce nothing but a bad hash ofequivocations, shoddy metaphors and unacknowledged “stolen” concepts.Epistemologically, it would produce the atrophy of the capacity to discriminate,and the panic of facing an immense, undifferentiated chaos of unintelligibledata—which means: the retrogression of an adult mind to the perceptual level ofawareness, to the helpless terror of primitive man. (This is happening today incertain schools of biology and psychology, whose false definition of the concept“learning” has led to attempts to equate the “behavior” of a piece of magnetizediron with the “behavior” of man.)The requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria ofconceptualization. They can be summed up best in the form of an epistemological“razor”: concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity—the corollary ofwhich is: nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity.As to the optional area of concept-formation, it consists predominantly ofsubdivisions that denote subtle shades of meaning, such as adjectives which arealmost, but not fully, synonymous. This area is the special province of literaryartists: it represents a form of unit-economy that permits an enormous eloquenceof expression (including emotional evocation). Most languages have words thathave no single-word equivalent in other languages. But since words do haveobjective referents, such “optional” concepts of one language can be and aretranslated into another by means of descriptive phrases.The optional area includes also the favorite category (and straw man) of modernphilosophers: the “Borderline Case.”By “Borderline Case,” they mean existents which share some characteristics withthe referents of a given concept, but lack others; or which share somecharacteristics with the referents of two different concepts and are, in effect,epistemological middle-of-the-road’ers—e.g., certain primitive organisms thatbiologists are unable to classify fully as either animals or plants.The modern philosophers’ favorite examples of this “problem” are expressed bysuch questions as: “What precise shade of color represents the conceptualborderline between ‘red’ and ‘orange’?” Or: “If you had never seen any swans butwhite ones, and then discovered a black one, by what criteria would you decidewhether to classify it as a ‘swan’ or to give it a different name and coin a newconcept?” Or: “If you discovered the existence of a Martian who had a rationalmind, but a spider’s body, would you classify him as a rational animal, i.e., as‘man’?”All this is accompanied by the complaint that “Nature doesn’t tell us whichchoice to make,” and purports to demonstrate that concepts represent arbitrarygroupings formed by human (social) whim, that they are not determined byobjective criteria and have no cognitive validity.What these doctrines do demonstrate is the failure to grasp the cognitive roleof concepts—i.e., the fact that the requirements of cognition determine theobjective criteria of concept-formation. The conceptual classification of newlydiscovered existents depends on the nature and extent of their differences fromand similarities to the previously known existents.In the case of black swans, it is objectively mandatory to classify them as“swans,” because virtually all their characteristics are similar to thecharacteristics of the white swans, and the difference in color is of nocognitive significance. (Concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.) Inthe case of the rational spider from Mars (if such a creature were possible),the differences between him and man would be so great that the study of onewould scarcely apply to the other and, therefore, the formation of a new conceptto designate the Martians would be objectively mandatory. (Concepts are not tobe integrated in disregard of necessity.)In the case of existents whose characteristics are equally balanced between thereferents of two different concepts—such as primitive organisms, or thetransitional shades of a color continuum—there is no cognitive necessity toclassify them under either (or any) concept. The choice is optional: one maydesignate them as a sub-category of either concept, or (in the case of acontinuum) one may draw approximate dividing lines (on the principle of “no morethan x and no less than y”), or one may identify them descriptively—as thenominalists are doing when they present the “problem.”(This “problem” is a straw man, in the sense that it is a problem only to thetraditional-realist theories of universals, which claim that concepts aredetermined by and refer to archetypes or metaphysical “essences.”)If it should be asked, at this point: Who, then, is to keep order in theorganization of man’s conceptual vocabulary, suggest the changes or expansionsof definitions, formulate the principles of cognition and the criteria ofscience, protect the objectivity of methods and of communications within andamong the special sciences, and provide the guidelines for the integration ofmankind’s knowledge?—the answer is: philosophy. These, precisely, are the tasksof epistemology. The highest responsibility of philosophers is to serve as theguardians and integrators of human knowledge.This is the responsibility on which modern philosophy has not merely defaulted,but worse: which it has reversed. It has taken the lead in the disintegrationand destruction of knowledge—and has all but committed suicide in the process.Philosophy is the foundation of science; epistemology is the foundation ofphilosophy. It is with a new approach to epistemology that the rebirth ofphilosophy has to begin."},{"pageContent":"8.Consciousness and IdentityThe organization of concepts into propositions, and the wider principles oflanguage—as well as the further problems of epistemology—are outside the scopeof this work, which is concerned only with the nature of concepts. But a fewaspects of these issues must be indicated.Since concepts, in the field of cognition, perform a function similar to that ofnumbers in the field of mathematics, the function of a proposition is similar tothat of an equation: it applies conceptual abstractions to a specific problem.A proposition, however, can perform this function only if the concepts of whichit is composed have precisely defined meanings. If, in the field of mathematics,numbers had no fixed, firm values, if they were mere approximations determinedby the mood of their users—so that “5,” for instance, could mean five in somecalculations, but six-and-a-half or four-and-three-quarters in others, accordingto the users’ “convenience”—there would be no such thing as the science ofmathematics.Yet this is the manner in which most people use concepts, and are taught to doso.Above the first-level abstractions of perceptual concretes, most people holdconcepts as loose approximations, without firm definitions, clear meanings orspecific referents; and the greater a concept’s distance from the perceptuallevel, the vaguer its content. Starting from the mental habit of learning wordswithout grasping their meanings, people find it impossible to grasp higherabstractions, and their conceptual development consists of condensing fog intofog into thicker fog—until the hierarchical structure of concepts breaks down intheir minds, losing all ties to reality; and, as they lose the capacity tounderstand, their education becomes a process of memorizing and imitating. Thisprocess is encouraged and, at times, demanded by many modern teachers who purveysnatches of random, out-of-context information in undefined, unintelligible,contradictory terms.The result is a mentality that treats the first-level abstractions, the conceptsof physical existents, as if they were percepts, and is unable to rise muchfurther, unable to integrate new knowledge or to identify its own experience—amentality that has not discovered the process of conceptualization in consciousterms, has not learned to adopt it as an active, continuous, self-initiatedpolicy, and is left arrested on a concrete-bound level, dealing only with thegiven, with the concerns of the immediate moment, day or year, anxiously sensingan abyss of the unknowable on all sides.To such mentalities, higher concepts are indeterminate splinters flickering inthe abyss, which they seize and use at random, with a nameless sense of guilt,with the chronic terror of a dreadful avenger that appears in the form of thequestion: “What do you mean?”Words, as such people use them, denote unidentified feelings, unadmittedmotives, subconscious urges, chance associations, memorized sounds, ritualisticformulas, second-hand cues—all of it hung, like barnacles, on some swimmingsuggestion of some existential referent. Consequently (since one cannot formconcepts of consciousness without reference to their existential content), thefield of introspection, to such people, is an untouched jungle in which noconceptual paths have yet been cut. They are unable to distinguish thought fromemotion, cognition from evaluation, observation from imagination, unable todiscriminate between existence and consciousness, between object and subject,unable to identify the meaning of any inner state—and they spend their lives ascowed prisoners inside their own skulls, afraid to look out at reality,paralyzed by the mystery of their own consciousness.These are the mentalities that modern philosophy now asks us to accept as thecriterion of the meaning of concepts.There is an element of grim irony in the emergence of Linguistic Analysis on thephilosophical scene. The assault on man’s conceptual faculty has beenaccelerating since Kant, widening the breach between man’s mind and reality. Thecognitive function of concepts was undercut by a series of grotesquedevices—such, for instance, as the “analytic-synthetic” dichotomy which, by aroute of tortuous circumlocutions and equivocations, leads to the dogma that a“necessarily” true proposition cannot be factual, and a factual propositioncannot be “necessarily” true. The crass skepticism and epistemological cynicismof Kant’s influence have been seeping from the universities to the arts, thesciences, the industries, the legislatures, saturating our culture, decomposinglanguage and thought. If ever there was a need for a Herculean philosophicaleffort to clean up the Kantian stables—particularly, to redeem language byestablishing objective criteria of meaning and definition, which average mencould not attempt—the time was now. As if sensing that need, Linguistic Analysiscame on the scene for the avowed purpose of “clarifying” language—and proceededto declare that the meaning of concepts is determined in the minds of averagemen, and that the job of philosophers consists of observing and reporting on howpeople use words.The reductio ad absurdum of a long line of mini-Kantians, such as pragmatistsand positivists, Linguistic Analysis holds that words are an arbitrary socialproduct immune from any principles or standards, an irreducible primary notsubject to inquiry about its origin or purpose—and that we can “dissolve” allphilosophical problems by “clarifying” the use of these arbitrary, causeless,meaningless sounds which hold ultimate power over reality. (The implicitpsychological confession is obvious: it is an attempt to formalize and elevatesecond-handedness into a philosophical vocation.)Proceeding from the premise that words (concepts) are created by whim,Linguistic Analysis offers us a choice of whims: individual or collective. Itdeclares that there are two kinds of definitions: “stipulative,” which may beanything anyone chooses, and “reportive,” which are ascertained by polls ofpopular use.As reporters, linguistic analysts were accurate: Wittgenstein’s theory that aconcept refers to a conglomeration of things vaguely tied together by a “familyresemblance” is a perfect description of the state of a mind out of focus.Such is the current condition of philosophy. If, in recent decades, there hasbeen an enormous “brain-drain” from the humanities, with the best minds seekingescape and objective knowledge in the physical sciences (as demonstrated by thedearth of great names or achievements in the humanities), one need look nofurther for its causes. The escape, however, is illusory. It is not the specialsciences that teach man to think; it is philosophy that lays down theepistemological criteria of all special sciences.To grasp and reclaim the power of philosophy, one must begin by grasping whyconcepts and definitions cannot and may not be arbitrary. To grasp that fully,one must begin by grasping the reason why man needs such a science asepistemology.Man is neither infallible nor omniscient; if he were, a discipline such asepistemology—the theory of knowledge—would not be necessary nor possible: hisknowledge would be automatic, unquestionable and total. But such is not man’snature. Man is a being of volitional consciousness: beyond the level ofpercepts—a level inadequate to the cognitive requirements of his survival—manhas to acquire knowledge by his own effort, which he may exercise or not, and bya process of reason, which he may apply correctly or not. Nature gives him noautomatic guarantee of his mental efficacy; he is capable of error, of evasion,of psychological distortion. He needs a method of cognition, which he himselfhas to discover: he must discover how to use his rational faculty, how tovalidate his conclusions, how to distinguish truth from falsehood, how to setthe criteria of what he may accept as knowledge. Two questions are involved inhis every conclusion, conviction, decision, choice or claim: What do Iknow?—and: How do I know it?It is the task of epistemology to provide the answer to the “How?”—which thenenables the special sciences to provide the answers to the “What?”In the history of philosophy—with some very rare exceptions—epistemologicaltheories have consisted of attempts to escape one or the other of the twofundamental questions which cannot be escaped. Men have been taught either thatknowledge is impossible (skepticism) or that it is available without effort(mysticism). These two positions appear to be antagonists, but are, in fact, twovariants on the same theme, two sides of the same fraudulent coin: the attemptto escape the responsibility of rational cognition and the absolutism ofreality—the attempt to assert the primacy of consciousness over existence.Although skepticism and mysticism are ultimately interchangeable, and thedominance of one always leads to the resurgence of the other, they differ in theform of their inner contradiction—the contradiction, in both cases, betweentheir philosophical doctrine and their psychological motivation.Philosophically, the mystic is usually an exponent of the intrinsic (revealed)school of epistemology; the skeptic is usually an advocate of epistemologicalsubjectivism. But, psychologically, the mystic is a subjectivist who usesintrinsicism as a means to claim the primacy of his consciousness over that ofothers. The skeptic is a disillusioned intrinsicist who, having failed to findautomatic supernatural guidance, seeks a substitute in the collectivesubjectivism of others.The motive of all the attacks on man’s rational faculty—from any quarter, in anyof the endless variations, under the verbal dust of all the murky volumes—is asingle, hidden premise: the desire to exempt consciousness from the law ofidentity. The hallmark of a mystic is the savagely stubborn refusal to acceptthe fact that consciousness, like any other existent, possesses identity, thatit is a faculty of a specific nature, functioning through specific means. Whilethe advance of civilization has been eliminating one area of magic afteranother, the last stand of the believers in the miraculous consists of theirfrantic attempts to regard identity as the disqualifying element ofconsciousness.The implicit, but unadmitted premise of the neo-mystics of modern philosophy, isthe notion that only an ineffable consciousness can acquire a valid knowledge ofreality, that “true” knowledge has to be causeless, i.e., acquired without anymeans of cognition.The entire apparatus of Kant’s system, like a hippopotamus engaged inbelly-dancing, goes through its gyrations while resting on a single point: thatman’s knowledge is not valid because his consciousness possesses identity. “Hisargument, in essence, ran as follows: man is limited to a consciousness of aspecific nature, which perceives by specific means and no others, therefore, hisconsciousness is not valid; man is blind, because he has eyes—deaf, because hehas ears—deluded, because he has a mind—and the things he perceives do notexist, because he perceives them.” (For the New Intellectual.)This is a negation, not only of man’s consciousness, but of any consciousness,of consciousness as such, whether man’s, insect’s or God’s. (If one supposed theexistence of God, the negation would still apply: either God perceives throughno means whatever, in which case he possesses no identity—or he perceives bysome divine means and no others, in which case his perception is not valid.) AsBerkeley negated existence by claiming that “to be, is to be perceived,” so Kantnegates consciousness by implying that to be perceived, is not to be.What Kant implied through coils of obfuscating verbiage, his more consistentfollowers declared explicitly. The following was written by a Kantian: “With him[Kant] all is phenomenal [mere appearance] which is relative, and all isrelative which is an object to a conscious subject. The conceptions of theunderstanding as much depend on the constitution of our thinking faculties, asthe perceptions of the senses do on the constitution of our intuitive faculties.Both might be different, were our mental constitution changed; both probably aredifferent to beings differently constituted. The real thus becomes identicalwith the absolute, with the object as it is in itself, out of all relation to asubject; and, as all consciousness is a relation between subject and object, itfollows that to attain a knowledge of the real we must go out of consciousness.”(Henry Mansel, “On the Philosophy of Kant,” reprinted in Henry Mansel, Letters,Lectures and Reviews, ed. H. W. Chandler, London: John Murray, 1873, p. 171.)From primordial mysticism to this, its climax, the attack on man’s consciousnessand particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallengedpremise that any knowledge acquired by a process of consciousness is necessarilysubjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is “processedknowledge.”Make no mistake about the actual meaning of that premise: it is a revolt, notonly against being conscious, but against being alive—since in fact, in reality,on earth, every aspect of being alive involves a process of self-sustaining andself-generated action. (This is an example of the fact that the revolt againstidentity is a revolt against existence. “The desire not to be anything, is thedesire not to be.” Atlas Shrugged.)All knowledge is processed knowledge—whether on the sensory, perceptual orconceptual level. An “unprocessed” knowledge would be a knowledge acquiredwithout means of cognition. Consciousness (as I said in the first sentence ofthis work) is not a passive state, but an active process. And more: thesatisfaction of every need of a living organism requires an act of processing bythat organism, be it the need of air, of food or of knowledge.No one would argue (at least, not yet) that since man’s body has to process thefood he eats, no objective rules of proper nutrition can ever be discovered—that“true nutrition” has to consist of absorbing some ineffable substance withoutthe participation of a digestive system, but since man is incapable of “truefeeding,” nutrition is a subjective matter open to his whim, and it is merely asocial convention that forbids him to eat poisonous mushrooms.No one would argue that since nature does not tell man automatically what toeat—as it does not tell him automatically how to form concepts—he should abandonthe illusion that there is a right or wrong way of eating (or he should revertto the safety of the time when he did not have to “trust” objective evidence,but could rely on dietary laws prescribed by a supernatural power).No one would argue that man eats bread rather than stones purely as a matter of“convenience.”It is time to grant to man’s consciousness the same cognitive respect one grantsto his body—i.e., the same objectivity.Objectivity begins with the realization that man (including his every attributeand faculty, including his consciousness) is an entity of a specific nature whomust act accordingly; that there is no escape from the law of identity, neitherin the universe with which he deals nor in the working of his own consciousness,and if he is to acquire knowledge of the first, he must discover the propermethod of using the second; that there is no room for the arbitrary in anyactivity of man, least of all in his method of cognition—and just as he haslearned to be guided by objective criteria in making his physical tools, so hemust be guided by objective criteria in forming his tools of cognition: hisconcepts.Just as man’s physical existence was liberated when he grasped the principlethat “nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed,” so his consciousness will beliberated when he grasps that nature, to be apprehended, must be obeyed—that therules of cognition must be derived from the nature of existence and the nature,the identity, of his cognitive faculty."},{"pageContent":"Summary1. Cognition and Measurement. The base of all of man’s knowledge is theperceptual level of awareness. It is in the form of percepts that man grasps theevidence of his senses and apprehends reality. The building-block of man’sknowledge is the concept of “existent” which is implicit in every percept. The(implicit) concept “existent” undergoes three stages of development in man’smind: entity-identity-unit. The ability to regard entities as units is man’sdistinctive method of cognition. A unit is an existent regarded as a separatemember of a group of two or more similar members. Measurement is theidentification of a quantitative relationship, by means of a standard thatserves as a unit. The purpose of measurement is to expand the range of man’sknowledge beyond the directly perceivable concretes.2. Concept-Formation. Similarity is the relationship between two or moreexistents which possess the same characteristic (s), but in different measure ordegree. The process of concept-formation consists of mentally isolating two ormore existents by means of their distinguishing characteristic, and retainingthis characteristic while omitting their particular measurements—on theprinciple that these measurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist inany quantity. A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessingthe same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurementsomitted.3. Abstraction from Abstractions. When concepts are integrated into a widerconcept, they serve as units and are treated epistemologically as if each were asingle (mental) concrete—always remembering that metaphysically (i.e., inreality) each unit stands for an unlimited number of concretes of a certainkind. When concepts are integrated into a wider one, the new concept includesall the characteristics of its constituent units; but their distinguishingcharacteristics are regarded as omitted measurements, and one of their commoncharacteristics becomes the distinguishing characteristic of the new concept.When a concept is subdivided into narrower ones, its distinguishingcharacteristic is retained and is given a narrower range of specifiedmeasurements or is combined with an additional characteristic(s) to form theindividual distinguishing characteristics of the new concepts.4. Concepts of Consciousness. Every state of consciousness involves twofundamental attributes: the content (or object) of awareness, and the action (orprocess) of consciousness in regard to that content. A concept pertaining toconsciousness is a mental integration of two or more instances of apsychological process possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), withthe particular contents and the measurements of the action’s intensity omitted.The intensity of a psychological process is measured on a comparative scale.Concepts pertaining to cognition are measured by the scope of their factualcontent and by the length of the conceptual chain required to grasp it. Conceptspertaining to evaluation are measured by reference to a person’s hierarchy ofvalues; this involves a process of “teleological measurement” which deals, notwith cardinal, but with ordinal numbers, establishing a graded relationship ofmeans to ends, i.e., of actions to a standard of value. A special category ofconcepts of consciousness consists of concepts pertaining to the products ofconsciousness (e.g., “knowledge”), and concepts of method (e.g., “logic”).5. Definitions. A definition is a statement that identifies the nature of aconcept’s units. A correct definition must specify the distinguishingcharacteristic(s) of the units (the differentia), and indicate the category ofexistents from which they were differentiated (the genus). The essentialdistinguishing characteristic(s) of the units and the proper definingcharacteristic(s) of the concept must be a fundamental charactcristic(s)—i.e.,that distinctive characteristic(s) which, metaphysically, makes the greatestnumber of other distinctive characteristics possible and which,epistemologically, explains the greatest number of others. Just as the processof concept-formation is contextual, so all definitions are contextual. Thedesignation of an essential characteristic depends on the context of man’sknowledge; a primitive definition, if correct, does not contradict a moreadvanced one: the latter merely expands the former. An objective definition,valid for all men, is determined according to all the relevant knowledgeavailable at that stage of mankind’s development. Definitions are notchangelessly absolute, but they are contextually absolute. A definition is falseif it does not specify the known relationships among existents (in terms of theknown essential characteristics) or if it contradicts the known.Every concept stands for a number of implicit propositions. A definition is thecondensation of a vast body of observations—and its validity depends on thetruth or falsehood of these observations, as represented and summed up by thedesignation of a concept’s essential, defining characteristic (s). The truth orfalsehood of all of man’s conclusions, inferences and knowledge rests on thetruth or falsehood of his definitions. The radical difference between theAristotelian view of concepts and the Objectivist view lies in the fact thatAristotle regarded “essence” as metaphysical; Objectivism regards it asepistemological.6. Axiomatic Concepts. An axiomatic concept is the identification of a primaryfact of reality, which is implicit in all facts and in all knowledge. It isperceived or experienced directly, but grasped conceptually. The first andprimary axiomatic concepts are “existence,” “identity” and “consciousness.” Theyidentify explicitly the omission of psychological time measurements, which isimplicit in all concepts—and serve as constants, as cognitive integrators andepistemological guidelines. They embrace the entire field of man’s awareness,delimiting it from the void of unreality to which conceptual errors can lead.Axiomatic concepts are not a matter of arbitrary choice; one ascertains whethera given concept is axiomatic or not by observing the fact that an axiomaticconcept has to be accepted and used even in the process of any attempt to denyit. Axiomatic concepts are the foundation of objectivity.7. The Cognitive Role of Concepts. The range of what man can hold in the focusof his conscious awareness at any given moment is limited. The essence of hiscognitive power is the ability to reduce a vast amount of information to aminimal number of units; this is the task performed by his conceptual faculty.Concepts represent condensations of knowledge, “open-end” classifications thatsubsume all the characteristics of their referents, the known and theyet-to-be-discovered; this permits further study and the division of cognitivelabor. The requirements of cognition control the formation of new concepts, andforbid arbitrary conceptual groupings. In the process of determining conceptualclassifications, neither the essential differences nor the essentialsimilarities among existents may be ignored once they have been observed. To sumup in the form of an epistemological “razor”: concepts are not to be multipliedbeyond necessity, nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity.8. Consciousness and Identity. The assault on man’s conceptual faculty has beenaccelerating since Kant, widening the breach between man’s mind and reality. Toreclaim the power of philosophy, one must grasp the reason why man needsepistemology. Since man is neither infallible nor omniscient, he has to discovera valid method of cognition. Two questions are involved in his every conclusionor decision: What do I know?—and: How do I know it? It is the task ofepistemology to provide the answer to the “How?” —which then enables the specialsciences to provide the answer to the “What?” In the history of philosophy,epistemological theories have consisted predominantly of attempts to escape oneor the other of these two questions—by means of skepticism or mysticism. Themotive of all the attacks on man’s rational faculty, is a single basic premise:the desire to exempt consciousness from the law of identity. The implicit, butunadmitted premise of modern philosophy is the notion that “true” knowledge mustbe acquired without any means of cognition, and that identity is thedisqualifying element of consciousness. This is the essence of Kant’s doctrine,which represents the negation of any consciousness, of consciousness as such.Objectivity begins with the realization that man (including his consciousness)is an entity of a specific nature who must act accordingly; that there is noescape from the law of identity; that there is no room for the arbitrary in anyactivity of man, least of all in his method of cognition—and that he must beguided by objective criteria in forming his tools of cognition: his concepts.Just as man’s physical existence was liberated when he grasped that “nature, tobe commanded, must be obeyed,” so his consciousness will be liberated when hegrasps that nature, to be apprehended, must be obeyed—that the rules ofcognition must be derived from the nature of existence and the nature, theidentity, of his cognitive faculty."},{"pageContent":"The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy by Leonard Peikoff(This work was first published inThe Objectivist May-September 1967.)INTRODUCTIONSome years ago, I was defending capitalism in a discussion with a prominentprofessor of philosophy. In answer to his charge that capitalism leads tocoercive monopolies, I explained that such monopolies are caused by governmentintervention in the economy and are logically impossible under capitalism. (Fora discussion of this issue, see Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.) The professorwas singularly unmoved by my argument, replying, with a show of surprise anddisdain:“Logically impossible? Of course—granted your definitions. You’re merely sayingthat, no matter what proportion of the market it controls, you won’t call abusiness a ‘coercive monopoly’ if it occurs in a system you call ‘capitalism.’Your view is true by arbitrary fiat, it’s a matter of semantics, it’s logicallytrue but not factually true. Leave logic aside now; be serious and consider theactual empirical facts on this matter.”To the philosophically uninitiated, this response will be baffling. Yet theymeet its equivalents everywhere today. The tenets underlying it permeate ourintellectual atmosphere like the germs of an epistemological black plaguewaiting to infect and cut down any idea that claims the support of conclusivelogical argumentation, a plague that spreads subjectivism and conceptualdevastation in its wake.This plague is a formal theory in technical philosophy; it is called: theanalytic-synthetic dichotomy. It is accepted, in some form, by virtually everyinfluential contemporary philosopher—pragmatist, logical positivist, analyst andexistentialist alike.The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy penetrates every corner of ourculture, reaching, directly or indirectly, into every human life, issue andconcern. Its carriers are many, its forms subtly diverse, its basic causescomplex and hidden—and its early symptoms prosaic and seemingly benign. But itis deadly.The comparison to a plague is not, however, fully exact. A plague attacks man’sbody, not his conceptual faculty. And it is not launched by the profession paidto protect men from it.Today, each man must be his own intellectual protector. In whatever guise thetheory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy confronts him, he must be able todetect it, to understand it, and to answer it. Only thus can he withstand theonslaught and remain epistemologically untouched.The theory in question is not a philosophical primary; one’s position on it,whether it be agreement or opposition, derives, in substantial part, from one’sview of the nature of concepts. The Objectivist theory of concepts is presentedabove, in Ayn Rand’s Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology. In the presentdiscussion, I shall build on this foundation. I shall summarize the theory ofthe analytic-synthetic dichotomy as it would be expounded by its contemporaryadvocates, and then answer it point by point.The theory was originated, by implication, in the ancient world, with the viewsof Pythagoras and Plato, but it achieved real prominence and enduring influenceonly after its advocacy by such modern philosophers as Hobbes, Leibniz, Hume andKant. (The theory was given its present name by Kant.) In its dominantcontemporary form, the theory states that there is a fundamental cleavage inhuman knowledge, which divides propositions or truths into two mutuallyexclusive (and jointly exhaustive) types. These types differ, it is claimed, intheir origins, their referents, their cognitive status, and the means by whichthey are validated. In particular, four central points of difference are allegedto distinguish the two types.a. Consider the following pairs of true propositions:i) A man is a rational animal.ii) A man has only two eyes.i) Ice is a solid.ii) Ice floats on water.i) 2 plus 2 equals 4.ii) 2 qts. of water mixed with 2 qts. of ethyl alcohol yield 3.86 qts. ofliquid, at 15.56°C.The first proposition in each of these pairs, it is said, can be validatedmerely by an analysis of the meaning of its constituent concepts (thus, theseare called “analytic” truths). If one merely specifies the definitions of therelevant concepts in any of these propositions, and then applies the laws oflogic, one can see that the truth of the proposition follows directly, and thatto deny it would be to endorse a logical contradiction. Hence, these are alsocalled “logical truths,” meaning that they can be validated merely by correctlyapplying the laws of logic.Thus, if one were to declare that “A man is not a rational animal,” or that “2plus 2 does not equal 4,” one would be maintaining by implication that “Arational animal is not a rational animal,” or that “1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1, doesnot equal 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1”—both of which are self-contradictory. (Theillustration presupposes that ”rational animal” is the definition of “man.”) Asimilar type of self-contradiction would occur if one denied that “Ice is asolid.”Analytic truths represent concrete instances of the Law of Identity; as such,they are also frequently called “tautologies” (which, etymologically, means thatthe proposition repeats “the same thing”; e.g., “A rational animal is a rationalanimal,” “The solid form of water is a solid”). Since all of the propositions oflogic and mathematics can ultimately be analyzed and validated in this fashion,these two subjects, it is claimed, fall entirely within the “analytic” or“tautological” half of human knowledge.Synthetic propositions, on the other hand—illustrated by the second propositionin each of the above pairs, and by most of the statements of daily life and ofthe sciences—are said to be entirely different on all these counts. A“synthetic” proposition is defined as one which cannot be validated merely by ananalysis of the meanings or definitions of its constituent concepts. Forinstance, conceptual or definitional analysis alone, it is claimed, could nottell one whether ice floats on water, or what volume of liquid results whenvarious quantities of water and ethyl alcohol are mixed.In this type of case, said Kant, the predicate of the proposition (e.g., “floatson water”) states something about the subject (“ice”) which is not alreadycontained in the meaning of the subject-concept. (The proposition represents asynthesis of the subject with a new predicate, hence the name.) Such truthscannot be validated merely by correctly applying the laws of logic; they do notrepresent concrete instances of the Law of Identity. To deny such truths is tomaintain a falsehood, but not a self-contradiction. Thus, it is false to assertthat “A man has three eyes,” or that “Ice sinks in water”—but, it is said, theseassertions are not self-contradictory. It is the facts of the case, not the lawsof logic, which condemn such statements. Accordingly, synthetic truths are heldto be “factual,” as opposed to “logical” or “tautological” in character.b. Analytic truths are necessary; no matter what region of space or what periodof time one considers, such propositions must hold true. Indeed, they are saidto be true not only throughout the universe which actually exists, but in “allpossible worlds”—to use Leibniz’s famous phrase. Since its denial isself-contradictory, the opposite of any analytic truth is unimaginable andinconceivable. A visitor from an alien planet might relate many unexpectedmarvels, but his claims would be rejected out-of-hand if he announced that, inhis world, ice was a gas, man was a postage stamp, and 2 plus 2 equaled 7.3.Synthetic truths, however, are declared not to be necessary; they are called“contingent.” This means: As a matter of fact, in the actual world that men nowobserve, such propositions happen to be true—but they do not have to be true.They are not true in “all possible worlds.” Since its denial is notself-contradictory, the opposite of any synthetic truth is at least imaginableor conceivable. It is imaginable or conceivable that men should have an extraeye (or a baker’s dozen of such eyes) in the back of their heads, or that iceshould sink in water like a stone, etc. These things do not occur in ourexperience but, it is claimed, there is no logical necessity about this. Thefacts stated by synthetic truths are “brute” facts, which no amount of logic canmake fully intelligible.Can one conclusively prove a synthetic proposition? Can one ever be logicallycertain of its truth? The answer given is: “No. As a matter of logic, nosynthetic proposition ‘has to be’ true; the opposite of any is conceivable.”(The most uncompromising advocates of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy continue:“You cannot even be certain of the direct evidence of your senses—for instance,that you now see a patch of red before you. In classifying what you see as‘red,’ you are implicitly declaring that it is similar in color to certain ofyour past experiences—and how do you know that you have remembered these lattercorrectly? That man’s memory is reliable, is not a tautology; the opposite isconceivable.”) Thus, the most one can ever claim for synthetic, contingenttruths is some measure of probability; they are more-or-less-likely hypotheses.c. Since analytic propositions are “logically” true, they can, it is claimed, bevalidated independently of experience; they are “non-empirical” or “a priori’(today, these terms mean: “independent of experience”). Modern philosophersgrant that some experience is required to enable a man to form concepts; theirpoint is that, once the appropriate concepts have been formed (e.g., “ice,”“solid,”, “water,” etc.), no further experience is required to validate theircombination into an analytically true proposition (e.g., “Ice is solid water”).The proposition follows simply from an analysis of definitions.Synthetic truths, on the other hand, are said to be dependent upon experiencefor their validation; they are “empirical” or “a posteriori.” Since they are“factual,” one can discover their truth initially only by observing theappropriate facts directly or indirectly; and since they are “contingent,” onecan find out whether yesterday’s synthetic truths are still holding today, onlyby scrutinizing the latest empirical data.d. Now we reach the climax: the characteristically twentieth-century explanationof the foregoing differences. It is: Analytic propositions provide noinformation about reality, they do not describe facts, they are“non-ontological” (i.e., do not pertain to reality). Analytic truths, it isheld, are created and sustained by men’s arbitrary decision to use words (orconcepts) in a certain fashion, they merely record the implications oflinguistic (or conceptual) conventions. This, it is claimed, is what accountsfor the characteristics of analytic truths. They are non-empirical—because theysay nothing about the world of experience. No fact can ever cast doubt uponthem, they are immune from future correction—because they are immune fromreality. They are necessary—because men make them so.“The propositions of logic,” said Wittgenstein in the Tractatus, “all say thesame thing: that is, nothing.” “The principles of logic and mathematics,” saidA. J. Ayer in Language, Truth and Logic, “are true universally simply because wenever allow them to be anything else.”Synthetic propositions, on the other hand, are factual—and for this, man pays aprice. The price is that they are contingent, uncertain and unprovable.The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the followingchoice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; ifit is about existents, it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logicalargument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logiccannot establish it. If you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of yourconcepts, then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal toyour percepts, then you cannot be certain of it.Objectivism rejects the theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy as false—inprinciple, at root, and in every one of its variants.Now, let us analyze and answer this theory point by point.“ANALYTIC” AND “SYNTHETIC” TRUTHSAn analytic proposition is defined as one which can be validated merely by ananalysis of the meaning of its constituent concepts. The critical question is:What is included in “the meaning of a concept”? Does a concept mean theexistents which it subsumes, including all their characteristics? Or does itmean only certain aspects of these existents, designating some of theircharacteristics but excluding others?The latter viewpoint is fundamental to every version of the analytic-syntheticdichotomy. The advocates of this dichotomy divide the characteristics of theexistents subsumed under a concept into two groups: those which are included inthe meaning of the concept, and those—the great majority—which, they claim, areexcluded from its meaning. The dichotomy among propositions follows directly. Ifa proposition links the “included” characteristics with the concept, it can bevalidated merely by an “analysis” of the concept; if it links the “excluded”characteristics with the concept, it represents an act of “synthesis.”For example: it is commonly held that, out of the vast number of man’scharacteristics (anatomical, physiological, psychological, etc.), two—“rationality” and “animality”—constitute the entire meaning of the concept“man.” All the rest, it is held, are outside the concept’s meaning. On thisview, it is “analytic” to state that “A man is a rational animal” (the predicateis “included” in the subject-concept), but “synthetic” to state that “A man hasonly two eyes” (the predicate is “excluded”).The primary historical source of the theory that a concept includes some of anentity’s characteristics but excludes others, is the Platonic realist theory ofuniversals. Platonism holds that concepts designate non-material essences(universals) subsisting in a supernatural dimension. Our world, Plato claimed,is only the reflection of these essences, in a material form. On this view, aphysical entity possesses two very different types of characteristics: thosewhich reflect its supernatural essence, and those which arise from the factthat, in this world, the essence is manifest in material form. The first are“essential” to the entity, and constitute its real nature; the second arematter-generated “accidents.” Since concepts are said to designate essences, theconcept of an entity includes its “essential” characteristics, but excludes its“accidents.”How does one differentiate “accidents” from “essential” characteristics in aparticular case? The Platonists’ ultimate answer is: By an act of “intuition.”(A more plausible and naturalistic variant of the essence-accident dichotomy isendorsed by Aristotelians; on this point, their theory of concepts reflects astrong Platonic influence.)In the modern era, Platonic realism lost favor among philosophers; nominalismprogressively became the dominant theory of concepts. The nominalists rejectsupernaturalism as unscientific, and the appeal to “intuition” as a thinlyveiled subjectivism. They do not, however, reject the crucial consequence ofPlato’s theory: the division of an entity’s characteristics into two groups, oneof which is excluded from the concept designating the entity.Denying that concepts have an objective basis in the facts of reality,nominalists declare that the source of concepts is a subjective human decision:men arbitrarily select certain characteristics to serve as the basis (the“essentials”) for a classification; thereafter, they agree to apply the sameterm to any concretes that happen to exhibit these “essentials,” no matter howdiverse these concretes are in other respects. On this view, the concept (theterm) means only those characteristics initially decreed to be “essential.” Theother characteristics of the subsumed concretes bear no necessary connection tothe “essential” characteristics, and are excluded from the concept’s meaning.Observe that, while condemning Plato’s mystic view of a concept’s meaning, thenominalists embrace the same view in a skeptic version. Condemning theessence-accident dichotomy as implicitly arbitrary, they institute an explicitlyarbitrary equivalent. Condemning Plato’s “intuitive” selection of essences as adisguised subjectivism, they spurn the disguise and adopt subjectivism as theirofficial theory—as though a concealed vice were heinous, but a brazenly flauntedone, rational. Condemning Plato’s supernaturally determined essences, theydeclare that essences are socially determined, thus transferring to the provinceof human whim what had once been the prerogative of Plato’s divine realm. Thenominalists’ “advance” over Plato consisted of secularizing his theory. Tosecularize an error is still to commit it.Its form, however, changes. Nominalists do not say that a concept designatesonly an entity’s “essence,” excluding its “accidents.” Their secularized versionis: A concept is only a shorthand tag for the characteristics stated in itsdefinition; a concept and its definition are interchangeable; a concept meansonly its definition.It is the Platonic-nominalist approach to concept-formation, expressed in suchviews as these, that gives rise to the theory of the analytic-syntheticdichotomy. Yet its advocates commonly advance the dichotomy as a self-containedprimary, independent of any particular theory of concepts. Indeed, they usuallyinsist that the issue of concept-formation—since it is “empirical,” not“logical”—is outside the province of philosophy. (!) (Thus, they use thedichotomy to discredit in advance any inquiry into the issues on which thedichotomy itself depends.)In spite of this, however, they continue to advocate “conceptual analysis,” andto distinguish which truths can—or cannot—be validated by its practice. One isexpected to analyze concepts, without a knowledge of their source and nature—todetermine their meaning, while ignorant of their relationship to concretes. How?The answer implicit in contemporary philosophical practice is: “Since peoplehave already given concepts their meanings, we need only study common usage.” Inother words, paraphrasing Gait: “The concepts are here. How did they get here?Somehow.” (Atlas Shrugged)Since concepts are complex products of man’s consciousness, any theory orapproach which implies that they are irreducible primaries is invalidated bythat fact alone. Without a theory of concepts as a foundation, one cannot, inreason, adopt any theory about the nature or kinds of propositions; propositionsare only combinations of concepts.The Objectivist theory of concepts undercuts the theory of theanalytic-synthetic dichotomy at its root.According to Objectivism, concepts “represent classifications of observedexistents according to their relationships to other observed existents.” (AynRand, Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology; all further quotations in thissection, unless otherwise identified, are from this work.) To form a concept,one mentally isolates a group of concretes (of distinct perceptual units), onthe basis of observed similarities which distinguish them from all other knownconcretes (similarity is “the relationship between two or more existents whichpossess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure or degree”); then,by a process of omitting the particular measurements of these concretes, oneintegrates them into a single new mental unit: the concept, which subsumes allconcretes of this kind (a potentially unlimited number). The integration iscompleted and retained by the selection of a perceptual symbol (a word) todesignate it. “A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessingthe same distinguishing characteristic (s), with their particular measurementsomitted.”By isolating and integrating perceived concretes, by reducing the number ofmental units with which he has to deal, man is able to break up and organize hisperceptual field, to engage in specialized study, and to retain an unlimitedamount of information pertaining to an unlimited number of concretes.Conceptualization is a method of acquiring and retaining knowledge of that whichexists, on a scale inaccessible to the perceptual level of consciousness.Since a word is a symbol for a concept, it has no meaning apart from the contentof the concept it symbolizes. And since a concept is an integration of units, ithas no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of a conceptconsists of the units—the existents—which it integrates, including all thecharacteristics of these units.Observe that concepts mean existents, not arbitrarily selected portions ofexistents. There is no basis whatever—neither metaphysical nor epistemological,neither in the nature of reality nor of a conceptual consciouness—for a divisionof the characteristics of a concept’s units into two groups, one of which isexcluded from the concept’s meaning.Metaphysically, an entity is: all of the things which it is. Each of itscharacteristics has the same metaphysical status: each constitutes a part of theentity’s identity.Epistemologically, all the characteristics of the entities subsumed under aconcept are discovered by the same basic method: by observation of theseentities. The initial similarities, on the basis of which certain concretes wereisolated and conceptually integrated, were grasped by a process of observation;all subsequently discovered characteristics of these concretes are discovered bythe same method (no matter how complex the inductive procedures involved maybecome).The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, doesnot indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity—or from theconcept. A is A; existents are what they are, independent of the state of humanknowledge; and a concept means the existents which it integrates. Thus, aconcept subsumes and includes all the characteristics of its referents, knownand not-yet-known.(This does not mean that man is omniscient, or that he can capriciously ascribeany characteristics he chooses to the referents of his concepts. In order todiscover that an entity possesses a certain characteristic, one must engage in aprocess of scientific study, observation and validation. Only then does one knowthat that characteristic is true of the entity and, therefore, is subsumed underthe concept.)“It is crucially important to grasp the fact that a concept is an ‘open-end’classification which includes the yet-to-be-discovered characteristics of agiven group of existents. All of man’s knowledge rests on that fact.“The pattern is as follows: When a child grasps the concept ‘man,’ the knowledgerepresented by that concept in his mind consists of perceptual data, such asman’s visual appearance, the sound of his voice, etc. When the child learns todifferentiate between living entities and inanimate matter, he ascribes a newcharacteristic, ‘living,’ to the entity he designates as ‘man.’ When the childlearns to differentiate among various types of consciousness, he includes a newcharacteristic in his concept of man, ‘rational’ —and so on. The implicitprinciple guiding this process, is: ‘I know that there exists such an entity asman; I know many of his characteristics, but he has many others which I do notknow and must discover.’ The same principle directs the study of every otherkind of perceptually isolated and conceptualized existents.“The same principle directs the accumulation and transmission of mankind’sknowledge. From a savage’s knowledge of man ... [to the present level], theconcept ‘man’ has not changed: it refers to the same kind of entities. What haschanged and grown is the knowledge of these entities.”What, then, is the meaning of the concept “man”? “Man” means a certain type ofentity, a rational animal, including all the characteristics of this entity(anatomical, physiological, psychological, etc., as well as the relations ofthese characteristics to those of other entities)—all the characteristicsalready known, and all those ever to be discovered. Whatever is true of theentity, is meant by the concept.It follows that there are no grounds on which to distinguish “analytic” from“synthetic” propositions. Whether one states that “A man is a rational animal,”or that “A man has only two eyes”—in both cases, the predicated characteristicsare true of man and are, therefore, included in the concept “man.” The meaningof the first statement is: “A certain type of entity, including all itscharacteristics (among which are rationality and animality) is: a rationalanimal.” The meaning of the second is: “A certain type of entity, including allits characteristics (among which is the possession of only two eyes) has: onlytwo eyes.” Each of these statements is an instance of the Law of Identity; eachis a “tautology”; to deny either is to contradict the meaning of the concept“man,” and thus to endorse a self-contradiction.A similar type of analysis is applicable to every true statement. Every truthabout a given existent(s) reduces, in basic pattern, to: “X is: one or more ofthe things which it is.” The predicate in such a case states somecharacteristic(s) of the subject; but since it is a characteristic of thesubject, the concept(s) designating the subject in fact includes the predicatefrom the outset. If one wishes to use the term “tautology” in this context, thenall truths are “tautological.” (And, by the same reasoning, all falsehoods areself-contradictions.)When making a statement about an existent, one has, ultimately, only twoalternatives: “X (which means X, the existent, including all itscharacteristics) is what it is”—or: “X is not what it is.” The choice betweentruth and falsehood is the choice between “tautology” (in the sense explained)and self-contradiction.In the realm of propositions, there is only one basic epistemologicaldistinction: truth vs. falsehood, and only one fundamental issue: By what methodis truth discovered and validated? To plant a dichotomy at the base of humanknowledge—to claim that there are opposite methods of validation and oppositetypes of truth—is a procedure without grounds or justification.In one sense, no truths are “analytic.” No proposition can be validated merelyby “conceptual analysis”; the content of the concept—i.e., the characteristicsof the existents it integrates—must be discovered and validated by observation,before any “analysis” is possible. In another sense, all truths are “analytic.”When some characteristic of an entity has been discovered, the propositionascribing it to the entity will be seen to be “logically true” (its oppositewould contradict the meaning of the concept designating the entity). In eithercase, the analytic-logical-tautological vs. synthetic-factual dichotomycollapses.To justify their view that some of an entity’s characteristics are excluded fromthe concept designating it, both Platonists and nominalists appeal to thedistinction between the “essential” and the “non-essential” characteristics ofan entity. For the Platonists, this distinction represents a metaphysicaldivision, intrinsic to the entity, independent of man and of man’s knowledge.For the nominalists, it represents a subjective human decree, independent of thefacts of reality. For both schools, whatever their terminological or otherdifferences, a concept means only the essential (or defining) characteristics ofits units.Neither school provides an objective basis for the distinction between anentity’s “essential” and “non-essential” characteristics. (Supernaturalism—inits avowed or secularized form—is not an objective basis for anything.) Neitherschool explains why such a distinction is objectively required in the process ofconceptualization.This explanation is provided by Objectivism, and exposes the basic error in thePlatonic-nominalist position.When a man reaches a certain level of conceptual complexity, he needs todiscover a method of organizing and interrelating his concepts; he needs amethod that will enable him to keep each of his concepts clearly distinguishedfrom all the others, each connected to a specific group of existents clearlydistinguished from the other existents he knows. (In the early stages ofconceptual development, when a child’s concepts are comparatively few in numberand designate directly perceivable concretes, “ostensive definitions” aresufficient for this purpose.) The method consists of defining each concept, byspecifying the characteristic(s) of its units upon which the greatest number oftheir other known characteristics depends, and which distinguishes the unitsfrom all other known existents. The characteristic(s) which fulfills thisrequirement is designated the “essential” characteristic, in that context ofknowledge.Essential characteristics are determined contextually. The characteristic(s)which most fundamentally distinguishes a certain type of entity from all otherexistents known at the time, may not do so within a wider field of knowledge,when more existents become known and/or more of the entity’s characteristics arediscovered. The characteristic(s) designated as “essential”—and the definitionwhich expresses it—may alter as one’s cognitive context expands. Thus, essencesare not intrinsic to entities, in the Platonic (or Aristotelian) manner; theyare epistemological, not metaphysical. A definition in terms of essentialcharacteristics “is a device of man’s method of cognition—a means ofclassifying, condensing and integrating an ever-growing body of knowledge.”Nor is the designation of essential characteristics a matter of arbitrary choiceor subjective decree. A contextual definition can be formulated only after onehas fully considered all the known facts pertaining to the units in question:their similarities, their differences from other existents, the causalrelationships among their characteristics, etc. This knowledge determines whichcharacteristic(s) is objectively essential—and, therefore, which definition isobjectively correct—in a given cognitive context. Although the definitionexplicitly mentions only the essential characteristic(s), it implies andcondenses all of this knowledge.On the objective, contextual view of essences, a concept does not mean only theessential or defining characteristics of its units. To designate a certaincharacteristic as “essential” or “defining” is to select, from the total contentof the concept, the characteristic that best condenses and differentiates thatcontent in a specific cognitive context. Such a selection presupposes therelationship between the concept and its units: it presupposes that the conceptis an integration of units, and that its content consists of its units,including all their characteristics. It is only because of this fact that thesame concept can receive varying definitions in varying cognitive contexts.When “rational animal” is selected as the definition of “man,” this does notmean that the concept “man” becomes a shorthand tag for “anything whatever thathas rationality and animality.” It does not mean that the concept “man” isinterchangeable with the phrase “rational animal,” and that all of man’s othercharacteristics are excluded from the concept. It means: A certain type ofentity, including all its characteristics, is, in the present context ofknowledge, most fundamentally distinguished from all other entities by the factthat it is a rational animal. All the presently available knowledge of man’sother characteristics is required to validate this definition, and is implied byit. All these other characteristics remain part of the content of the concept“man.”The nominalist view that a concept is merely a shorthand tag for its definition,represents a profound failure to grasp the function of a definition in theprocess of concept-formation. The penalty for this failure is that the processof definition, in the hands of the nominalists, achieves the exact opposite ofits actual purpose. The purpose of a definition is to keep a concept distinctfrom all others, to keep it connected to a specific group of existents. On thenominalist view, it is precisely this connection that is severed: as soon as aconcept is defined, it ceases to designate existents, and designates insteadonly the defining characteristic.And further: On a rational view of definitions, a definition organizes andcondenses—and thus helps one to retain—a wealth of knowledge about thecharacteristics of a concept’s units. On the nominalist view, it is preciselythis knowledge that is discarded when one defines a concept: as soon as adefining characteristic is chosen, all the other characteristics of the unitsare banished from the concept, which shrivels to mean merely the definition. Forinstance, as long as a child’s concept of “man” is retained ostensively, thechild knows that man has a head, two eyes, two arms, etc.; on the nominalistview, as soon as the child defines “man,” he discards all this knowledge;thereafter, “man” means to him only: “a thing with rationality and animality.”On the nominalist view, the process of defining a concept is a process ofcutting the concept off from its referents, and of systematically evading whatone knows about their characteristics. Definition, the very tool which isdesigned to promote conceptual integration, becomes an agent of its destruction,a means of disintegration.The advocates of the view that a concept means its definition, cannot escape theknowledge that people actually use concepts to designate existents. (When awoman says: “I married a wonderful man,” it is clear to most philosophers thatshe does not mean: “I married a wonderful combination of rationality andanimality.”) Having severed the connection between a concept and its referents,such philosophers sense that somehow this connection nevertheless exists and isimportant. To account for it, they appeal to a theory which goes back manycenturies and is now commonly regarded as uncontroversial: the theory that aconcept has two kinds or dimensions of meaning. Traditionally, these arereferred to as a concept’s “extension” (or “denotation”) and its “intension” (or“connotation”).By the “extension” of a concept, the theory’s advocates mean the concretessubsumed under that concept. By the “intension” of a concept, they mean thosecharacteristics of the concretes which are stated in the concept’s definition.(Today, this is commonly called the “conventional” intension; the distinctionamong various types of intension, however, merely compounds the errors of thetheory, and is irrelevant in this context.) Thus, in the extensional sense,“man” means Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Tom, Dick, Harry, etc. In theintensional sense, “man” means “rational animal.”A standard logic text summarizes the theory as follows: “The intension of aterm, as we have noted, is what is usually called its definition. The extension,on the other hand, simply refers us to the set of objects to which thedefinition applies.... Extension and intension are thus intimately related, butthey refer to objects in diferent ways—extension to a listing of the individualswho fall within its quantitative scope, intension to the qualities orcharacteristics of the individuals.” (Lionel Ruby, Logic: An Introduction.)This theory introduces another artificial split: between an existent and itscharacteristics. In the sense in which a concept means its referents (itsextensional meaning), it does not mean or refer to their characteristics (itsintensional meaning), and vice versa. One’s choice, in effect, is: either tomean existents, apart from their characteristics—or (certain) characteristics,apart from the existents which possess them.In fact, neither of these alleged types of meaning is metaphysically orepistemologically possible.A concept cannot mean existents, apart from their characteristics. A thingis—what it is; its characteristics constitute its identity. An existent apartfrom its characteristics would be an existent apart from its identity, whichmeans: a nothing, a non-existent. To be conscious of an existent is to beconscious of (some of) its characteristics. This is true on all levels ofconsciousness, but it is particularly obvious on the conceptual level. When oneconceptualizes a group of existents, one isolates them mentally from others, onthe basis of certain of their characteristics. A concept cannot integrate—ormean—a miscellaneous grab bag of objects; it can only integrate, designate,refer to and mean: existents of a certain kind, existents possessing certaincharacteristics.Nor can the concept of an existent mean its characteristics (some or all), apartfrom the existent which possesses them. A characteristic is an aspect of anexistent. It is not a disembodied, Platonic universal. Just as a concept cannotmean existents apart from their identity, so it cannot mean identities apartfrom that which exists. Existence is Identity (Atlas Shrugged).The theory that a concept means its definition, is not improved when it iscombined with the view that, in another sense, a concept means its “extension.”Two errors do not make a truth. They merely produce greater chaos and confusion.The truth is that a concept means the existents it integrates, including alltheir characteristics. It is this view of a concept’s meaning that keeps man’sconcepts anchored to reality. On this view, the dichotomy between “analytic” and“synthetic” propositions cannot arise.NECESSITY AND CONTINGENCYThe theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy has its roots in two types oferror: one epistemological, the other metaphysical. The epistemological error,as I have discussed, is an incorrect view of the nature of concepts. Themetaphysical error is: the dichotomy between necessary and contingent facts.This theory goes back to Greek philosophy, and was endorsed in some form byvirtually all philosophical traditions prior to Kant. In the form in which it ishere relevant, the theory holds that some facts are inherent in the nature ofreality; they must exist; they are “necessary.” Other facts, however, happen toexist in the world that men now observe, but they did not have to exist; theycould have been otherwise; they are “contingent.” For instance, that water iswet would be a “necessary” fact; that water turns to ice at a certaintemperature, would be “contingent.”Given this dichotomy, the question arises: How does one know, in a particularcase, that a certain fact is necessary? Observation, it was commonly said, isinsufficient for this purpose. “Experience,” wrote Kant in the Critique of PureReason, “tells us, indeed, what is, but not that it must necessarily be so, andnot otherwise.” To establish that something is a fact, one employs observationand the appropriate inductive procedures; but, it was claimed, to establish thatsomething is a fact is not yet to show that the fact in question is necessary.Some warrant or guarantee, over and above the fact’s existence, is required ifthe fact is to be necessary; and some insight, over and above that yielded byobservation and induction, is required to grasp this guarantee.In the pre-Kantian era, it was common to appeal to some form of “intellectualintuition” for this purpose. In some cases, it was said, one could just “see”that a certain fact was necessary. How one could see this remained a mystery. Itappeared that human beings had a strange, inexplicable capacity to grasp byunspecified means that certain facts not only were, but had to be. In othercases, no such intuition operated, and the facts in question were deemedcontingent.In the post-Kantian era, appeals to “intellectual intuition” lost favor amongphilosophers, but the necessary-contingent dichotomy went on. Perpetuated invarious forms in the nineteenth century, it was reinterpreted in the twentiethas follows: since facts are learned only by experience, and experience does notreveal necessity, the concept of “necessary facts” must be abandoned. Facts, itis now held, are one and all contingent—and the propositions describing them are“contingent truths.” As for necessary truths, they are merely the products ofman’s linguistic or conceptual conventions. They do not refer to facts, they areempty, “analytic,” “tautological.” In this manner, the necessary-contingentdichotomy is used to support the alleged distinction between analytic andsynthetic propositions. Today, it is a commonplace for philosophers to remarkthat “factual” statements are “synthetic” and “contingent,” whereas “necessary”statements are “non-factual” and “analytic.”(Contemporary philosophers prefer to talk about propositions or statements,rather than about facts; they rarely say that facts are contingent, attributingcontingency instead to statements about facts. There is nothing to justify thismode of speech, and I shall not adhere to it in discussing their views.)Observe that both the traditional pre-Kantians and the contemporaryconventionalists are in essential agreement: both endorse thenecessary-contingent dichotomy, and both hold that necessary truths cannot bevalidated by experience. The difference is only this: for the traditionalphilosophers, necessity is a metaphysical phenomenon, grasped by an act ofintuition; for the conventionalists, it is a product of man’s subjectivechoices. The relationship between the two viewpoints is similar to therelationship between Platonists and nominalists on the issue of essences. Inboth cases, the moderns adopt the fundamentals of the traditionalist position;their “contribution” is merely to interpret that position in an avowedlysubjectivist manner.In the present issue, the basic error of both schools is the view that facts,some or all, are contingent. As far as metaphysical reality is concerned(omitting human actions from consideration, for the moment), there are no “factswhich happen to be but could have been otherwise” as against “facts which mustbe.” There are only: facts which are.The view that facts are contingent—that the way things actually are is only oneamong a number of alternative possibilities, that things could have beendifferent metaphysically—represents a failure to grasp the Law of Identity.Since things are what they are, since everything that exists possesses aspecific identity, nothing in reality can occur causelessly or by chance. Thenature of an entity determines what it can do and, in any given set ofcircumstances, dictates what it will do. The Law of Causality is entailed by theLaw of Identity. Entities follow certain laws of action in consequence of theiridentity, and have no alternative to doing so.Metaphysically, all facts are inherent in the identities of the entities thatexist; i.e., all facts are “necessary.” In this sense, to be is to be“necessary.” The concept of “necessity,” in a metaphysical context, issuperfluous.(The problem of epistemology is: how to discover facts, how to discover what is.Its task is to formulate the proper methods of induction, the methods ofacquiring and validating scientific knowledge. There is no problem of graspingthat a fact is necessary, after one has grasped that it is a fact.)For many centuries, the theory of “contingent facts” was associated with asupernaturalistic metaphysics; such facts, it was said, are the products of adivine creator who could have created them differently—and who can change themat will. This view represents the metaphysics of miracles—the notion that anentity’s actions are unrelated to its nature, that anything is possible to anentity regardless of its identity. On this view, an entity acts as it does, notbecause of its nature, but because of an omnipotent God’s decree.Contemporary advocates of the theory of “contingent facts” hold, in essence, thesame metaphysics. They, too, hold that anything is possible to an entity, thatits actions are unrelated to its nature, that the universe which exists is onlyone of a number of “possible worlds.” They merely omit God, but they retain theconsequences of the religious view. Once more, theirs is a secularizedmysticism.The fundamental error in all such doctrines is the failure to grasp thatexistence is a self-sufficient primary. It is not a product of a supernaturaldimension, or of anything else. There is nothing antecedent to existence,nothing apart from it—and no alternative to it. Existence exists—and onlyexistence exists. Its existence and its nature are irreducible and unalterable.The climax of the “miraculous” view of existence is represented by thoseexistentialists who echo Heidegger, demanding: “Why is there any being at alland not rather nothing?” —i.e., why does existence exist? This is the projectionof a zero as an alternative to existence, with the demand that one explain whyexistence exists and not the zero.Non-existentialist philosophers typically disdain Heidegger’s alleged question,writing it off as normal existentialist lunacy. They do not apparently realizethat in holding facts to be contingent, they are committing the same error. Whenthey claim that facts could have been otherwise, they are claiming thatexistence could have been otherwise. They scorn the existentialists forprojecting an alternative to the existence of existence, but spend their timeprojecting alternatives to the identity of existence.While the existentialists clamor to know why there is something and not nothing,the non-existentialists answer them (by implication): “This is a ridiculousquestion. Of course, there is something. The real question is: Why is thesomething what it is, and not something else?”A major source of confusion, in this issue, is the failure to distinguishmetaphysical facts from man-made facts—i.e., facts which are inherent in theidentities of that which exists, from facts which depend upon the exercise ofhuman volition. Because man has free will, no human choice—and no phenomenonwhich is a product of human choice—is metaphysically necessary. In regard to anyman-made fact, it is valid to claim that man has chosen thus, but it was notinherent in the nature of existence for him to have done so; he could havechosen otherwise. For instance, the U.S. did not have to consist of 50 states;men could have subdivided the larger ones or consolidated the smaller ones, etc.Choice, however, is not chance. Volition is not an exception to the Law ofCausality; it is a type of causation. Further, metaphysical facts areunalterable by man, and limit the alternatives open to his choice. Man canrearrange the materials that exist in reality, but he cannot violate theiridentity; he cannot escape the laws of nature. “Nature, to be commanded, must beobeyed.”Only in regard to the man-made is it valid to claim: “It happens to be, but itcould have been otherwise.” Even here, the term “contingent” is highlymisleading. Historically, that term has been used to designate a metaphysicalcategory of much wider scope than the realm of human action; and it has alwaysbeen associated with a metaphysics which, in one form or another, denies thefacts of Identity and Causality. The “necessary-contingent” terminology servesonly to introduce confusion, and should be abandoned. What is required in thiscontext is the distinction between the “metaphysical” and the “man-made.”The existence of human volition cannot be used to justify the theory that thereis a dichotomy of propositions or of truths. Propositions about metaphysicalfacts and propositions about man-made facts do not have differentcharacteristics qua propositions. They differ merely in their subject matter,but then so do the propositions of astronomy and of immunology. Truths aboutmetaphysical and about manmade facts are learned and validated by the sameprocess: by observation; and, qua truths, both are equally necessary. Some factsare not necessary, but all truths are.Truth is the identification of a fact of reality. Whether the fact in questionis metaphysical or man-made, the fact determines the truth: if the fact exists,there is no alternative in regard to what is true. For instance, the fact thatthe U.S. has 50 states was not metaphysically necessary—but as long as this ismen’s choice, the proposition that “The U.S. has 50 states” is necessarily true.A true proposition must describe the facts as they are. In this sense, a“necessary truth” is a redundancy, and a “contingent truth” aself-contradiction.LOGIC AND EXPERIENCEThroughout its history, philosophy has been torn by the conflict between therationalists and the empiricists. The former stress the role of logic in man’sacquisition of knowledge, while minimizing the role of experience; the latterclaim that experience is the source of man’s knowledge, while minimizing therole of logic. This split between logic and experience is institutionalized inthe theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy.Analytic statements, it is said, are independent of experience; they are“logical” propositions. Synthetic statements, on the other hand, are devoid oflogical necessity; they are “empirical” propositions.Any theory that propounds an opposition between the logical and the empirical,represents a failure to grasp the nature of logic and its role in humancognition. Man’s knowledge is not acquired by logic apart from experience or byexperience apart from logic, but by the application of logic to experience. Alltruths are the product of a logical identification of the facts of experience.Man is born tabula rasa; all his knowledge is based on and derived from theevidence of his senses. To reach the distinctively human level of cognition, manmust conceptualize his perceptual data—and conceptualization is a process whichis neither automatic nor infallible. Man needs to discover a method to guidethis process, if it is to yield conclusions which correspond to the facts ofreality—i.e., which represent knowledge. The principle at the base of the propermethod is the fundamental principle of metaphysics: the Law of Identity. Inreality, contradictions cannot exist; in a cognitive process, a contradiction isthe proof of an error. Hence the method man must follow: to identify the factshe observes, in a non-contradictory manner. This method is logic—“the art ofnon-contradictory identification.” (Atlas Shrugged.) Logic must be employed atevery step of a man’s conceptual development, from the formation of his firstconcepts to the discovery of the most complex scientific laws and theories. Onlywhen a conclusion is based on a noncontradictory identification and integrationof all the evidence available at a given time, can it qualify as knowledge.The failure to recognize that logic is man’s method of cognition, has produced abrood of artificial splits and dichotomies which represent restatements of theanalytic-synthetic dichotomy from various aspects. Three in particular areprevalent today: logical truth vs. factual truth; the logically possible vs. theempirically possible; and the a priori vs. the a posteriori.The logical-factual dichotomy opposes truths which are validated “merely” by theuse of logic (the analytic ones), to truths which describe the facts ofexperience (the synthetic ones). Implicit in this dichotomy is the view thatlogic is a subjective game, a method of manipulating arbitrary symbols, not amethod of acquiring knowledge.It is the use of logic that enables man to determine what is and what is not afact. To introduce an opposition between the “logical” and the “factual” is tocreate a split between consciousness and existence, between truths in accordancewith man’s method of cognition and truths in accordance with the facts ofreality. The result of such a dichotomy is that logic is divorced from reality(“Logical truths are empty and conventional”)—and reality becomes unknowable(“Factual truths are contingent and uncertain”). This amounts to the claim thatman has no method of cognition, i.e., no way of acquiring knowledge.The acquisition of knowledge, as Ayn Rand has observed, involves two fundamentalquestions: “What do I know?” and “How do I know it?” The advocates of thelogical-factual dichotomy tell man, in effect: “You can’t know the‘what’—because there is no ‘how.’ ” (These same philosophers claim to know thetruth of their position by means of unanswerable logical argument.)To grasp the nature of their epistemological procedure, consider a mathematicianwho would claim that there is a dichotomy between two types of truth in thematter of adding columns of figures: truths which state the actual sum of agiven column versus truths which are reached by adherence to the laws ofaddition—the “summational truths” vs. the “additive truths.” The formerrepresent the actual sums—which, however, are unfortunately unprovable andunknowable, since they cannot be arrived at by the methods of addition; thelatter, which are perfectly certain and necessary, are unfortunately asubjective fantasy-creation, with no relationship to actual sums in the actualworld. (At this point, a pragmatist mathematician comes along and provides his“solution”: “Adding,” he tells us, “may be subjective, but it works.” Why doesit? How does he know it does? What about tomorrow? “Those questions,” hereplies, “aren’t fruitful.”)If mathematicians were to accept this doctrine, the destruction of mathematicswould follow. When philosophers accept such a doctrine, the same consequencesmay be expected—with only this difference: the province of philosophy embracesthe total of human knowledge.Another restatement of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy is the view that opposesthe “logically” possible and the “empirically” possible.If the proposition that a given phenomenon exists is not self-contradictory,then that phenomenon, it is claimed, is “logically” possible; if the propositionis self-contradictory, then the phenomenon is “logically” impossible. Certainphenomena, however, although logically possible, are contrary to the“contingent” laws of nature that men discover by experience; these phenomena are“empirically” —but not “logically”—impossible. Thus, a married bachelor is“logically” impossible; but a bachelor who can fly to the moon by means offlapping his arms is merely “empirically” impossible (i.e., the proposition thatsuch a bachelor exists is not self-contradictory, but such a bachelor is not inaccordance with the laws that happen to govern the universe).The metaphysical basis of this dichotomy is the premise that a violation of thelaws of nature would not involve a contradiction. But as we have seen, the lawsof nature are inherent in the identities of the entities that exist. A violationof the laws of nature would require that an entity act in contradiction to itsidentity; i.e., it would require the existence of a contradiction. To projectsuch a violation is to endorse the “miraculous” view of the universe, as alreadydiscussed.The epistemological basis of this dichotomy is the view that a concept consistsonly of its definition. According to the dichotomy, it is logicallyimpermissible to contradict the definition of a concept; what one asserts bythis means is “logically” impossible. But to contradict any of the non-definingcharacteristics of a concept’s referents, is regarded as logically permissible;what one asserts in such a case is merely “empirically” impossible.Thus, a “married bachelor” contradicts the definition of “bachelor” and hence isregarded as “logically” impossible. But a “bachelor who can fly to the moon bymeans of flapping his arms” is regarded as “logically” possible, because thedefinition of “bachelor” (“an unmarried man”) does not specify his means oflocomotion. What is ignored here is the fact that the concept “bachelor” is asubcategory of the concept “man,” that as such it includes all thecharacteristics of the entity “man,” and that these exclude the ability to flyby flapping his arms. Only by reducing a concept to its definition and byevading all the other characteristics of its referents can one claim that suchprojections do not involve a self-contradiction.Those who attempt to distinguish the “logically” possible and the “empirically”possible commonly maintain that the “logically” impossible is ummaginable orinconceivable, whereas the merely “empirically” impossible is at leastimaginable or conceivable, and that this difference supports the distinction.For instance, “ice which is not solid” (a “logical” impossibility) isinconceivable; but “ice which sinks in water” (a merely “empirical”impossibility) is at least conceivable, they claim, even though it does notexist; one need merely visualize a block of ice floating on water, and suddenlyplummeting straight to the bottom.This argument confuses Walt Disney with metaphysics. That a man can project animage or draw an animated cartoon at variance with the facts of reality, doesnot alter the facts; it does not alter the nature or the potentialities of theentities which exist. An image of ice sinking in water does not alter the natureof ice; it does not constitute evidence that it is possible for ice to sink inwater. It is evidence only of man’s capacity to engage in fantasy. Fantasy isnot a form of cognition.Further: the fact that man possesses the capacity to fantasize does not meanthat the opposite of demonstrated truths is “imaginable” or “conceivable.” In aserious, epistemological sense of the word, a man cannot conceive the oppositeof a proposition he knows to be true (as apart from propositions dealing withman-made facts). If a proposition asserting a metaphysical fact has beendemonstrated to be true, this means that that fact has been demonstrated to beinherent in the identities of the entities in question, and that any alternativeto it would require the existence of a contradiction. Only ignorance or evasioncan enable a man to attempt to project such an alternative. If a man does notknow that a certain fact has been demonstrated, he will not know that its denialinvolves a contradiction. If a man does know it, but evades his knowledge anddrops his full cognitive context, there is no limit to what he can pretend toconceive. But what one can project by means of ignorance or evasion, isphilosophically irrelevant. It does not constitute a basis for instituting twoseparate categories of possibility.There is no distinction between the “logically” and the “empirically” possible(or impossible). All truths, as I have said, are the product of a logicalidentification of the facts of experience. This applies as much to theidentification of possibilities as of actualities.The same considerations invalidate the dichotomy between the a priori and the aposteriori. According to this variant, certain propositions (the analytic ones)are validated independently of experience, simply by an analysis of thedefinitions of their constituent concepts; these propositions are “a priori.”Others (the synthetic ones) are dependent upon experience for their validation;they are “a posteriori.”As we have seen, definitions represent condensations of a wealth ofobservations, i.e., a wealth of “empirical” knowledge; definitions can bearrived at and validated only on the basis of experience. It is senseless,therefore, to contrast propositions which are true “by definition” andpropositions which are true “by experience.” If an “empirical” truth is onederived from, and validated by reference to, perceptual observations, then alltruths are “empirical.” Since truth is the identification of a fact of reality,a “non-empirical truth” would be an identification of a fact of reality which isvalidated independently of observation of reality. This would imply a theory ofinnate ideas, or some equally mystical construct.Those who claim to distinguish a posteriori and a priori propositions commonlymaintain that certain truths (the synthetic, factual ones) are “empiricallyfalsifiable,” whereas others (the analytic, logical ones) are not. In the formercase, it is said, one can specify experiences which, if they occurred, wouldinvalidate the proposition; in the latter, one cannot. For instance, theproposition “Cats give birth only to kittens” is “empirically falsifiable”because one can invent experiences that would refute it such as the spectacle oftiny elephants emerging from a cat’s womb. But the proposition “Cats areanimals” is not “empirically falsifiable” because “cat” is defined as a speciesof animal. In the former case, the proposition remains true only as long asexperience continues to bear it out; therefore, it depends on experience, i.e.,it is a posteriori. In the latter case, the truth of the proposition is immuneto any imaginable change in experience and, therefore, is independent ofexperience, i.e., is a priori.Observe the inversion propounded by this argument: a proposition can qualify asa factual, empirical truth only if man is able to evade the facts of experienceand arbitrarily to invent a set of impossible circumstances that contradictthese facts; but a truth whose opposite is beyond man’s power of invention, isregarded as independent of and irrelevant to the nature of reality, i.e., as anarbitrary product of human “convention.”Such is the unavoidable consequence of the attempt to divorce logic andexperience.As I have said, knowledge cannot be acquired by experience apart from logic, norby logic apart from experience. Without the use of logic, man has no method ofdrawing conclusions from his perceptual data; he is confined torange-of-the-moment observations, but any perceptual fantasy that occurs to himqualifies as a future possibility which can invalidate his “empirical”propositions. And without reference to the facts of experience, man has no basisfor his “logical” propositions, which become mere arbitrary products of his owninvention. Divorced from logic, the arbitrary exercise of the human imaginationsystematically undercuts the “empirical”; and divorced from the facts ofexperience, the same imagination arbitrarily creates the “logical.”I challenge anyone to invent a more thorough way of invalidating all of humanknowledge.CONCLUSIONThe ultimate result of the theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy is thefollowing verdict pronounced on human cognition: if the denial of a propositionis inconceivable, if there is no possibility that any fact of reality cancontradict it, i.e., if the proposition represents knowledge which is certain,then it does not represent knowledge of reality. In other words: if aproposition cannot be wrong, it cannot be right. A proposition qualifies asfactual only when it asserts facts which are still unknown, i.e., only when itrepresents a hypothesis; should a hypothesis be proved and become a certainty,it ceases to refer to facts and ceases to represent knowledge of reality. If aproposition is conclusively demonstrated—so that to deny it is obviously toendorse a logical contradiction—then, in virtue of this fact, the proposition iswritten off as a product of human convention or arbitrary whim.This means: a proposition is regarded as arbitrary precisely because it has beenlogically proved. The fact that a proposition cannot be refuted, refutes it(i.e., removes it from reality). A proposition can retain a connection to factsonly insofar as it has not been validated by man’s method of cognition, i.e., bythe use of logic. Thus proof is made the disqualifying element of knowledge, andknowledge is made a function of human ignorance.This theory represents a total epistemological inversion: it penalizes cognitivesuccess for being success. Just as the altruist mentality penalizes the good forbeing the good, so the analytic-synthetic mentality penalizes knowledge forbeing knowledge. Just as, according to altruism, a man is entitled only to whathe has not earned, so, according to this theory, a man is entitled to claim asknowledge only what he has not proved. Epistemological humility becomes theprerequisite of cognition: “the meek shall inherit the truth.”The philosopher most responsible for these inversions is Kant. Kant’s systemsecularized the mysticism of the preceding centuries and thereby gave it a newlease on life in the modern world. In the religious tradition, “necessary”truths were commonly held to be consequences of God’s mode of thought. Kantsubstituted the “innate structure of the human mind” for God, as the source andcreator of “necessary” truths (which thus became independent of the facts ofreality).The philosophers of the twentieth century merely drew the final consequences ofthe Kantian view. If it is man’s mode of thought (independent of reality) thatcreates “necessary” truths, they argued, then these are not fixed or absolute;men have a choice in regard to their modes of thought; what the mind giveth, themind taketh away. Thus, the contemporary conventionalist viewpoint.We can know only the “phenomenal,” mind-created realm, according to Kant; inregard to reality, knowledge is impossible. We can be certain only within therealm of our own conventions, according to the moderns; in regard to facts,certainty is impossible.The moderns represent a logical, consistent development from Kant’s premises.They represent Kant plus choice—a voluntaristic Kantianism, a whim-worshipingKantianism. Kant marked the cards and made reason an agent of distortion. Themoderns are playing with the same deck; their contribution is to play it deuceswild, besides.Now observe what is left of philosophy in consequence of this neo-Kantianism.Metaphysics has been all but obliterated: its most influential opponents havedeclared that metaphysical statements are neither analytic nor synthetic, andtherefore are meaningless.Ethics has been virtually banished from the province of philosophy: some groupshave claimed that ethical statements are neither analytic nor synthetic, but aremere “emotive ejaculations”—and other groups have consigned ethics to theprovince of the man in the street, claiming that philosophers may analyze thelanguage of ethical statements, but are not competent to prescribe ethicalnorms.Politics has been discarded by virtually all philosophic schools: insofar aspolitics deals with values, it has been relegated to the same status as ethics.Epistemology, the theory of knowledge, the science that defines the rules bywhich man is to acquire knowledge of facts, has been disintegrated by the notionthat facts are the subject matter of “synthetic,” “empirical” propositions and,therefore, are outside the province of philosophy—with the result that thespecial sciences are now left adrift in a rising tide of irrationalism.What we are witnessing is the self-liquidation of philosophy.To regain philosophy’s realm, it is necessary to challenge and reject thefundamental premises which are responsible for today’s debacle. A major step inthat direction is the elimination of the death carrier known as theanalytic-synthetic dichotomy."},{"pageContent":"AppendixExcerpts from the Epistemology WorkshopsThe material from this point on was not included in the edition of the bookpublished by Ayn Rand. This appendix was made possible by a grant from the AynRand Institute.FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITIONA substantial appendix has been added to this edition of Introduction toObjectivist Epistemology. The appendix consists of excerpts from four workshopson epistemology that Ayn Rand conducted in New York City between 1969 and 1971.The workshops were opportunities for a dozen professionals in philosophy, plus afew in physics and mathematics, to ask Miss Rand questions about her theory ofconcepts, which had first appeared in print in her own magazine, TheObjectivist, in 1966-67. I myself took part in the workshops, as did HarryBinswanger, a longtime associate of Miss Rand’s who has performed the complextask of editing these excerpts for publication.The tape recordings of the workshops contain some twenty-one hours ofdiscussion. There is much new material of philosophic interest on the tapes;what is new pertains not to the essentials of Ayn Rand’s theory, but to theexact meaning, presuppositions, and/or implications of some particular aspect orformulation of the theory. Given the chance to explain some importantqualifications, I am happy to make the cream of this new material available nowto a wider audience.The workshops were extended conversations. A few of the questions were submittedin writing, but most were not.The questions generally dealt with highly technical subjects, which demandrigorous precision; Ayn Rand’s answers were completely extemporaneous. She saidas much or as little on a given point as the company required for its ownclarity. Miss Rand did not speak with an eye to publication or consider theneeds of a future audience.No one, not even Ayn Rand, can speak extemporaneously with the precision andeconomy possible in written work. If she had decided to publish the workshops,Miss Rand would have edited the material extensively, weighing every wordchoice. The substance of her position on the issues would not have changed insuch a case, but she would undoubtedly have decided to make many revisions inwording.The questions asked in the workshops were uneven. Part of the reason is that thequestioners, myself included, had not yet had the time fully to absorb sorevolutionary a theory or, therefore, to know what to ask; as a rule, we werethinking aloud, groping to identify our confusions. In addition, we broughtwidely different cognitive contexts (and interests) to the discussions, some ofus being relatively advanced in the study of Objectivism, others having only asketchy impression. As a result, one person often needed a detailed discussionto be able to grasp a point that another considered obvious or unimportant. Thiskind of difference will apply, I am sure, to readers of the appendix, also.Harry Binswanger has selected for publication the questions he regards as beingof most general philosophic interest. Even these do not invariably raise issuesthat Ayn Rand herself regarded as critical; for the most part, she answeredwhatever was asked of her, regardless of her opinion of the question. I wouldadvise a reader, therefore, to approach the appendix selectively and selfishly(in the Objectivist sense), pausing only on the material he personally findsilluminating.The length of the appendix may not be taken as an index of its importance withinthe Objectivist corpus. Nor does my decision to publish this material make it“official Objectivist doctrine.” Dr. Binswanger and I believe that Miss Randwould have agreed with or at least accepted our editorial decisions. But“Objectivism” is the name of Ayn Rand’s achievement, and her theory of conceptsis presented in the book she herself published, i.e., the present edition minusthe appendix. Dr. Binswanger has done excellent, sensitive work on the appendix;he has remained as faithful as possible to the spirit and letter of the originalconversations. The final result, however, is still Ayn Rand in an edited versionthat she herself had no opportunity to see or approve.Aside from its new epistemological content, the appendix offers the readeranother value: a glimpse of Ayn Rand’s mind at work in the heat of philosophicalgive and take. I had hundreds of such conversations with Miss Rand and alwaysfound her method of approach fascinating in its own right, regardless of thesubject being discussed.Here is a chance not only to learn further details of her theory of concepts,but also to see Ayn Rand herself in philosophic action.—Leonard Peikoff Executor, Estate of Ayn Rand South Laguna, CA April 1989PREFACEThe purpose of these workshops, Miss Rand says in her opening remarks, was to“chew” the Objectivist theory of concepts. “Chewing” was her metaphor for abroad range of mental activities which, by analogy with physical chewing, breakdown a complex whole so that it can be digested. Such “chewing” includes:defining terms, checking the meaning of key formulations, concretizing points bymeans of examples, drawing implications, and integrating the topic with relatedmaterial.Since what follows is not a verbatim transcript of the workshops, and since AynRand never reviewed this material in any form, the reader has a right to knowwhat editing has been done and what measures were taken to ensure that theresult is a faithful version of the intellectual content of the sessions ingeneral and of Ayn Rand’s statements in particular. The editing consisted ofcutting, reorganizing, and line-editing.Cutting. A full transcript of the workshops would run to triple the length ofthis appendix. I have selected what I consider the most interesting andilluminating of the discussions and have condensed further by eliminating,within the sections selected, some of the repetitions and digressions that areendemic to oral exchanges. But when in doubt about including a somewhatrepetitious passage, I left it in, on the grounds that “chewing” requireslooking at the same point from slightly different perspectives. My generalpolicy was to err on the side of over-inclusiveness in regard to Miss Rand’sanswers, as this may well be the last opportunity for her statements on thesetopics to be published.I was more liberal in condensing the participants’ questions. Some of thequestions were considerably longer, wordier, and more roundabout than theyappear here. Sometimes a question was rephrased several times, with exchangesamong several of the participants, before its meaning became clear, and much ofthat circling around has been eliminated. But I stuck closely to the professors’formulations when Miss Rand’s response was to express agreement with what theysaid.Reorganizing. The workshops proceeded through the book in sequence, chapter bychapter. But that order did not apply on the smaller scale: within each chapter,the order of topics was determined by what each questioner, in turn, chose toask. Consequently, some rearrangement of topics was called for in order tocreate a more logical sequence. I have collected into one location questions onrelated topics, irrespective of when in the twenty-one hours they actuallyoccurred. For instance, the question I have placed first here actually occurredabout three hours into the first session. In one or two cases I have insertedinto a continuous discussion a few paragraphs from a separate discussion, butotherwise, in changing the order of topics, I have kept separate discussionsseparate rather than joining or merging them.In its present form, the discussion begins with questions dealing with the heartof the process of concept-formation—abstraction throughmeasurement-omission—then moves to concepts and words, then returns to take upsome of the more technical aspects of measurement and related quasi-mathematicalissues. After that, the progression conforms to the order of the chapters in thebook, followed by a more metaphysically oriented section centering on theconcept of “entity.” The appendix concludes with a section on some issues in thephilosophy of science, plus a historical postscript. (The table of contentsgiven here is entirely my own.)Line-editing. Even though her remarks were extemporaneous little alteration ofMiss Rand’s statements was needed.Of the changes that have been made, the vast majority consisted merely ininnocuous alterations for the sake of grammar and smoothness, such asrearranging the order of clauses within a sentence, changing the tense of verbs,and specifying antecedents for pronouns that would be ambiguous in written form.There were a few instances where Leonard Peikoff and I jointly believed that agiven statement might be confusing or misleading without further elaboration. Inthese cases I either deleted the statement outright or used square brackets toinsert my own clarifying term or remark. (Please note: square brackets, notparentheses, signal my insertions.)Since the whole process required editing in several layers over a period ofmonths, at its completion I went back through the entire manuscript, checkingword by word against the corresponding sections of the tapes.I am satisfied that the result is a fair and accurate rendering of thediscussions.—Harry BinswangerNew York CityApril 1989OPENING REMARKS BY AYN RANDI am very glad to see you all here. I have a definite purpose in mind for thesesessions—namely, to make as clear as possible the nature of the Objectivisttheory of concepts. My purpose here will not be to talk about Objectivismgenerally, but to discuss in detail—or, as we call it, to “chew”—this particularbook. I regard it as very important; I hope you do too. I think this is afoundation which will help us to understand anything else about Objectivism.I do not want to discuss my Foreword; I assume that everybody here understandswhat the problem of universals is. The only other issue left open in theForeword is the question of the validity of sensory data. I indicated that anyargument against the validity of sensory data commits what we call the fallacyof the “stolen concept” by relying on the validity of the senses in the attemptto deny them. And I assume that everyone here, if he is in any agreement with usat all, does accept the fact that sensory data are valid.I also would like to add that the study of sensations as such is much more theprovince of science than of philosophy, since we are not consciously aware ofsingle, isolated sensations. Therefore, we can start where we in fact do start:on the level of percepts.I will ask everyone, to the best of his ability, to consider the subject fromscratch—that is, from the beginning, as if we know nothing about concepts. Startfrom that, as near as one can, and avoid questions based on a different context,on some philosophical theory which is false. In framing your questions, pleasetry to observe whether they are based on and imply some premise improperlyaccepted as an axiom. Or, in other words, please check your premises.ABSTRACTION AS MEASUREMENT-OMISSIONOVERVIEW OF THE PROCESSProf. A: I want to check my understanding of your theory of concept-formation.What I would like to do is give a brief summary of the process and ask you tocomment as to whether I understand it correctly.AR: All right.Prof. A: First of all, I’d like to distinguish the Objectivist position onconcept-formation from the Aristotelian position. According to theAristotelians, there is some common element, or essence, which is identical inall the concretes of a given kind, and concept-formation is simply the selectiveawareness of that element. So for Aristotle, the “manness” of men would besomething that you would merely focus on selectively; and the “manness” of eachman is the same.The Objectivist position is that the “manness” of each man is specific—or notthe “manness,” but the characteristic of rationality. As I understand it, eachperson’s form of rationality has specific measurements, and my rationality or“manness” would not be literally identical to someone else’s. But what we do inconcept-formation, through a process of measurement-omission, is integrate theconcretes according to their common attributes.Now, as I understand it, the measurement-omission is accomplished by means ofdifferentiation. Take the concept of “blue.” You begin as a child with two blueobjects of different shades perhaps (so their specific color measurementsdiffer), and, say, one red object. And then you are able to see that the twoblues belong together as opposed to the red; whereas if you just consider thetwo blues by themselves, you would only be aware of the differences betweenthem; you wouldn’t see them as similar until you contrasted them to the red.AR: That’s right.Prof. A: Now, the heart of the matter that I want to check on is this. Is itthat by means of this differentiation you see blueness as a range or category ofmeasurements within the Conceptual Common Denominator: color? That is the way Iunderstand it. You see the blue of this object and the somewhat different blueof that other object; both have specific measurements, but those measurementsfall into one category, as opposed to the measurements of some red object, whichfall outside that category. So that the omission of measurements is seeing themeasurements as falling within a given range or category of measurements—AR: Yes.Prof. A:—within the Conceptual Common Denominator.AR: Yes, that’s right. Now, the essential thing there is that you cannot form aconcept by integration alone or by differentiation alone. You need both, always.You need to observe similarities in a certain group of objects and differencesfrom some other group of objects within the common standard or kind ofmeasurement. So that you could differentiate a red cup from two blue cups, butyou couldn’t differentiate a blue cup from a heavy stone—there is no ConceptualCommon Denominator in that kind of distinction. Does that answer your question?Prof. A: Yes.AR: There is one thing that I want to correct you on, unless it was justforeshortening. You said that “manness” consists of rationality. Don’t everforget the full definition is “rational animal.” Otherwise you may give theimpression that rationality is the equivalent of the concept “man.”Prof. A: No, that was just an offhand way of speaking.AR: Merely foreshortening. Okay.Prof. A: So the Aristotelians thought there really was an attribute of bluenessas such—like a kind of little banner sticking up from blue objects saying“blue.” Whereas the Objectivist position is that there is a Conceptual CommonDenominator uniting a red and two blues, and that the two blues are closetogether on the measurement range within that Conceptual Common Denominator, andthat all the different shades of blue can be integrated because they fall withinthat range.AR: Exactly.SIMILARITY AND MEASUREMENT-OMISSIONProf. B: In forming the concept “blue,” a child would perceive that two bluethings, with respect to color, are similar and are different from some redthing. And he places the blues in a range of measurements within the broadercategory, red being somewhere else on the scale.AR: Right.Prof. B: Now, in fact, he doesn’t have a category of measurements explicitly, sowhat actually goes on, as you indicate, is that he perceives similarities anddifferences directly.AR: That’s right.Prof. B: Then is what enables him to classify the blue things as blue the factthat he experiences them as belonging together, as against the red one?AR: If you are trying to project what his psychological state actually is, Ithink the better way to say it would be: he would feel “these things are similarand these things are different,” rather than “they belong together,” because thesecond is a more sophisticated concept.If you want to know what the nature of the process is, it would be more usefulto try to remember how you, as an adult, learn new concepts. Because we learnnew concepts constantly—for instance, concepts for new inventions, such astelevision or radar. Ask yourself how you learned that these objects are calledby such-and-such name, and how you learned to distinguish television from radio,or radar from other forms of wireless communication. Observe that you wouldfirst have to grasp that there is such an entity, and then you would have tograsp in what way it is different from the class of objects which it resemblesmost. You would immediately have to establish a relationship of genus anddifferentia. Now, it never occurred to you to measure television, and itwouldn’t be necessary to do so. You simply grasped what it has in common withradio and in what ways it is different.Prof. B: Regarding similarity, is it correct to say that similarity is the formin which we perceive certain quantitative differences within a range?AR: That’s right.Prof. B: So, “similarity” is an epistemological concept, and a formulation ofthe metaphysical base of that would be: quantitative differences within a range.AR: That’s right.005 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_005_r1.jpg]Prof. B: To describe the process of concept-formation on a conscious level, onewouldn’t have to refer to omitting measurements. Is the purpose then ofdiscussing it in terms of omitting measurements to stress the metaphysical basisof the process?AR: No, not only to stress the metaphysical basis, but to explain both themetaphysical and the epistemological aspects. Because, in modern philosophy,they dismiss similarity practically as if it were ineffable; the wholenominalist school rests on that in various ways. The nominalists claim that weform concepts on the ground of vague similarities, and then they go intoinfinite wasted discussions about what we mean by similarity, and they arrive atthe conclusion that nobody can define similarity. So that one of the importantissues here, and the reason for going into the process in detail, is to indicatethe metaphysical base of similarity and the fact that it is graspedperceptually, that it is not a vague, arbitrary abstraction, that similarity isperceptually given, but the understanding of what similarity means has to bearrived at philosophically or scientifically. And similarity, when analyzed,amounts to: measurements omitted.006 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_006_r1.jpg]Prof. C: I understand how one grasps similarity on the perceptual level.Aristotle, presumably, was unable to identify how we grasp similarity beyondthat point. He held that we grasp the essence of things—namely, how they aresimilar—intuitively. What in addition to that is the Objectivist theory stating?AR: He didn’t say you grasp similarities intuitively. He said you grasp theessence of things intuitively.Prof. C: Yes, the essence as the fundamental similarity.AR: But that isn’t the way he saw it. Aristotle proceeded from a certainerroneous metaphysics. He assumed that there are such things as essences—andthat’s the Platonism in him. But he didn’t agree with Plato’s theory thatessences are in a separate world. He held that essences do exist, but only inconcretes. And the process of concept-formation, in his view, is the process ofgrasping that essence, and therefore grouping concretes in certain categoriesbecause they have that essence in common. It is the same essence, but indifferent concretes.You see, he approaches the subject from that perspective. He isn’t concernedwith perceived similarities and differences. And since he can’t explain how itis that we grasp these essences, which are not perceived by our senses, he wouldhave to treat that grasp as a direct intuition, a form of direct awareness likepercepts, but of a different order and therefore apprehending different objects.MEASUREMENT-OMISSION AND GENERALITYProf. D: This is meant to be a counterexample to a very important part of yourthesis: the role of measurement-omission in concept-formation. In general, Iagree with what you say, but here is the problem I have. I take it that aconcept’s generality of reference is achieved by leaving out the specificmeasurements of the objects referred to.AR: Right.Prof. D: But now take the following case. I have a concept of a specific kind oftire, “710-15 tires.” This concept specifies all of the significant measurementsof the tire (its width and diameter). So what measurements have I left out informing the concept to achieve the generality?AR: The measurements relevant to the concept “tire.” When you say that this is aparticular kind of tire, and you specify the measurements, you are talking abouta subcategory of the wider category “tire.” In order to identify it as a 710-15tire, you first had to know that it is possible to have 620-15 tires (orwhatever the figures might be), which you would also subsume under the concept“tire.”What you have omitted in classifying a particular group by its measurements isthe fact that those measurements may be altered and the object would still be atire, but not a tire of this subgrouping. You have merely isolated a subcategoryof the wider concept “tire.”I think it is exactly the same process as I described in subdividing “table”into “dining table,” “coffee table,” etc. [page 23] Those are subcategories,with more restricted measurements, of the wider category, whose measurements arealso limited within a certain range.Prof. D: But if it is the omission of the exact measurements that provides agenerality of reference, then if you reintroduce the exact measurements wouldn’tyou dissolve the generality?AR: You merely narrow it down. You merely form a subcategory.Prof. D: But I would find that all of these particular tires measure exactly 710by 15.Prof. E: There would still be many respects in which the measurements of thosetires would vary, even if the physical dimensions that you specify remainconstant. For instance, they could be whitewall tires or ordinary black ones,presumably they could be made out of somewhat different types of material, etc.Therefore, even though a certain range of measurements was fixed, there wouldstill be variations along other dimensions.AR: But also there is the ultimate variation which you mustn’t forget: they areindividual tires. Suppose, theoretically, that you could with the finestinstruments produce a set of tires of exactly the same measurable aspects inevery respect. This wouldn’t make them blend into one super-tire. You wouldstill say, “I have one hundred tires of this particular kind.”But in order even to make that observation, you first have to have the concept“tire.” You first have to know that the issue involved here is the issue ofmeasurements. And if this particular group of tires is identical in all theirmeasurements, it is a subgroup; in this respect they are different from othertires, which may have different measurements.Prof. D: But if the essence of generality was the omission of the specificmeasurement of the individuals, then by reintroducing the specific measurementof individuals the generality would be lost.AR: Except for one very important element that you omit here and that can’t beomitted: the Conceptual Common Denominator. Even if all tires, [not just onesubgroup], were absolutely alike in every measurement (which is not reallypossible, but assuming that for the sake of argument), you couldn’t form theconcept “tire” unless there was something that you could isolate that groupingfrom. Let us suppose it is the concept of the wheel or some other part of anautomobile. Unless you differentiate this particular grouping from another onewith which it has something in common but differs in measurement, you couldn’thave a concept. Because you forget there are two aspects of the process—one isintegration, but the first one is separation [i.e., differentiation].Prof. D: But does the separation give you the generality, or is it the type ofintegration that operates that gives you the generality?AR: Both. One is not possible without the other. You could not integrate a givenset of concretes unless you could first differentiate it from other concretes.You have to isolate it first, and then you can integrate it into a particulargrouping and form a concept. But if you can’t isolate it, you can’t abstract.Prof. D: Then you are maintaining that the generality remains in the case of thesubcategory where measurements are specified; the generality isn’t lost becauseit was originally obtained in the concept of “tire” by leaving out measurements,and bringing back in the measurements now doesn’t affect the generality of thenotion of tires.AR: Not only was the generality present originally, but you are using andintroducing it when you say these are 710-15 tires. The generality is present inthe classification of these objects as tires. By identifying them in that formyou are introducing the issue of measurement-omission by classifying them stillas tires. If you didn’t do that, then you couldn’t call them tires. Then theywould be sui generis objects; but they are not, they are tires. Why do youclassify them as that? Because their submeasurements, which you are nowspecifying, are different from the measurements of others which you call“tires”; yet you subsume them in the same concept, in the same category. So youare using measurement-omission even in the classification.THE CONCEPTUAL COMMON DENOMINATORProf. E: In the process of concept-formation in childhood, am I correct that itis impossible for a mind to mistakenly choose a Conceptual Common Denominator?That is, if in fact the two groups were incommensurable, the child’s mind wouldjust stop. He couldn’t actually form a concept in this case mistakenly, couldhe?AR: I don’t think so. Here, frankly, I have not considered it, but as an offhandanswer, I don’t quite see how that would be possible.Prof. A: On the perceptual level, you wouldn’t then be aware of similarities anddifferences.AR: Yes. Now in the case of abstractions from abstractions that sort of mistakeis unfortunately made constantly. Only the result isn’t really a concept. Itusually comes out as one of those “anti-concepts.” [See page 71.]007 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_007_r1.jpg]Prof. D: I can think of some cases that seem to present a difficulty for thestatement: “All conceptual differentiations are made in terms of commensurablecharacteristics.” What would you say about the case of distinguishing mentalentities from physical entities? You have the concept of “mental entity” vs. theconcept of “physical entity,” and there you are distinguishing objects whichpresumably possess no commensurable characteristic.AR: But you don’t form those concepts directly. You form the concept “mentalentity” only after you have formed the following concepts: the concept “man,”the concept “consciousness,” then you identify certain mental states or eventsin your own mind, such as thoughts, let’s say, which you call “mental entities.”Then you infer that other human beings also possess the ability to have mentalentities in their minds. Therefore you have gone through a long conceptualchain, making differentiations as you went along. You didn’t start by looking atreality from scratch so to speak, and as a first-level concept form the concept“mental entity” as distinguished from “physical entity.” That would not bepossible. They would be incommensurable.Now remember, I said here that you cannot form a concept, a specific concept, bydifferentiating objects through an incommensurable characteristic. But, [onceformed], you can relate such objects in a wider sense. And the commensurablecharacteristic between physical objects and consciousness is the content ofconsciousness, as I discuss in Chapter 4. There is a commensurable link [betweenconcepts of consciousness and existential concepts], but that link will be foundafter you have established the fact of consciousness. Then you consider, “Whatdo I have inside my mind?” and you see that it is exclusively made up of contentderived from the outside world, from existence. (It may be indirectly derived,such as you may have thoughts about other thoughts, or you may think about yourmemories. But ultimately the content of your consciousness, since it beginstabula rasa, consists entirely of your awareness of the outside world.) Andthere you have the commensurable attribute, or one of the commensurableattributes, which is essential in forming concepts of consciousness.008 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_008_r1.jpg]Prof. A: Isn’t what is commensurable or incommensurable an issue of one’scontext of knowledge? Between length and color, for instance, there is actuallya commensurable characteristic in a wider context of knowledge—both areattributes—but in order to reach that wider characteristic, you have to begin bymaking differentiations which you can grasp as commensurable. Or else, you wouldnever get to that later stage.AR: That’s right. Even in the wider context, however, it isn’t thatcharacteristics which appeared at the first level to be incommensurable suddenlybecome commensurable.Here we are talking particularly about the process of concept-formation. In thatprocess, you cannot form a concept to unify concretes into one category exceptby means of a commensurable characteristic. And two characteristics that appearto you, on the perceptual level, as incommensurable (like length and green) willnot be commensurable at any stage. But you will be able to establish certainrelationships between them through many other intermediate concepts. But bythemselves those two will remain incommensurable. If we take just the referentsof the concepts “length” and “green,” there is nothing that you can establish asa commensurable characteristic between them.Prof. A: If you differentiated length and green from man, at a sophisticatedlevel of knowledge, on the basis of the fact that man is an entity, while lengthand green are both attributes, there you have found a Conceptual CommonDenominator, but you couldn’t reach that stage without the earlier abstractions.AR: That’s right. But between those two, if you were to consider only those twoattributes, apart from “man” or any other concepts, just those two, they won’tbecome commensurable. But when you establish the category “attributes ofphysical objects,” then you see they have that in common.CONCEPTS AS OPEN-ENDEDProf. A: Concepts are open-ended in the sense that every new concrete of thesame type is to be subsumed under the concept. Can you say anything about theprocess by which a child moves from a limited group from which he forms theconcept to making it open-ended? How does he get beyond the concretes from whichhe starts?AR: In order to grasp a concept he has to grasp that it applies to all entitiesof that particular kind. If he doesn’t, he’s merely repeating a word. If youever watch how a child learns to speak, he may first grasp only that “nose”applies to his own nose and, let’s say, his mother’s. But he hasn’t grasped theconcept until he can point to any face and say “nose.” And that is what childrenusually do; that is exactly how they learn words. First they have to grasp theword as standing for a particular concrete, then they begin to apply it to otherconcretes of that kind. Until they have done that, they haven’t got it yet. Butonce they begin to apply the word to new concretes of the same kind, they’vemade it open-ended.Prof. A: So to make the classification open-ended is part of the integrationitself?AR: Yes.Prof. A: To see that there is a kind of thing.AR: Yes.THREE “HARD CASES”Prof. D: Here are some concepts that present a difficulty with respect toleaving out differing specific measurements and abstracting a common feature.What measurements of what particulars do we leave out and what common featuresdo we retain in the case of the following three concepts: (1) “God”; (2)“infinity”; (3) “nothing”?AR: What measurements do we omit?Prof. D: Yes. And what common features of particulars are retained in order toget the concept “God”—AR: I would have to refer you to a brief passage about invalid concepts [page49]. This is precisely one, if not the essential one, of the epistemologicalobjections to the concept “God.” It is not a concept. At best, one could say itis a concept in the sense in which a dramatist uses concepts to create acharacter. It is an isolation of actual characteristics of man combined with theprojection of impossible, irrational characteristics which do not arise fromreality—such as omnipotence and omniscience.Besides, God isn’t even supposed to be a concept: he is sui generis, so thatnothing relevant to man or the rest of nature is supposed, by the proponents ofthat viewpoint, to apply to God. A concept has to involve two or more similarconcretes, and there is nothing like God. He is supposed to be unique.Therefore, by their own terms of setting up the problem, they have taken God outof the conceptual realm. And quite properly, because he is out of reality.The same applies to the concept “infinity,” taken metaphysically. The concept of“infinity” has a very definite purpose in mathematical calculation, and there itis a concept of method. But that isn’t what is meant by the term “infinity” assuch. “Infinity” in the metaphysical sense, as something existing in reality, isanother invalid concept. The concept “infinity,” in that sense, means somethingwithout identity, something not limited by anything, not definable.Therefore, the measurements omitted here are all measurements and all reality.Now, what was the third one?Prof. D: “Nothing.”AR: That is strictly a relative concept. It pertains to the absence of some kindof concrete. The concept “nothing” is not possible except in relation to“something.” Therefore, to have the concept “nothing,” you mentally specify—inparenthesis, in effect—the absence of a something, and you conceive of “nothing”only in relation to concretes which no longer exist or which do not exist atpresent.You can say “I have nothing in my pocket.” That doesn’t mean you have an entitycalled “nothing” in your pocket. You do not have any of the objects that couldconceivably be there, such as handkerchiefs, money, gloves, or whatever.“Nothing” is strictly a concept relative to some existent concretes whoseabsence you denote in this form.It is very important to grasp that “nothing” cannot be a primary concept. Youcannot start with it in the absence of, or prior to, the existence of someobject. That is the great trouble with Existentialism, as I discuss in the book[page 60]. There is no such concept as “nothing,” except as a relational conceptdenoting the absence of some things. The measurements omitted are themeasurements of those things.Prof. A: Does the concept of “nonexistence” refer only to an absence? Is thereno valid concept of sheer non-being, of something that never was and never willbe?AR: That’s right. Non-existence as such—particularly in the same generalizedsense in which I use the term “existence” in saying “existence exists,” that is,as the widest abstraction without yet specifying any content, or applying to allcontent—you cannot have the concept “non-existence” in that same fundamentalway. In other words, you can’t say: this is something pertaining to the wholeuniverse, to everything I know, and I don’t say what. In other words, withoutspecifying content.You see. the concept of “existence” interates all of the existents that you haveperceived, without knowing all their characteristics. Whereas the concept of“non-existence” in that same psycho-epistemological position would be literallya blank. Non-existence-apart from what it is that doesn’t exist—is an impossibleconcept. It’s a hole—a literal blank, a zero.It is precisely on the fundamental level of equating existence and non-existenceas some kind of opposites that the greatest mistakes occur, as inExistentialism.ABSTRACTION AS VOLITIONALProf. D: Abstraction is a volitional act. Is that right?AR: Oh yes.Prof. D: Then how do I go about abstracting the very first time? How do I knowwhat to do, volitionally? Unless I first I had the idea of abstraction, howcould I proceed to will to abstract?AR: No, you do something else volitionally. That is, you abstract volitionally,but you don’t will it directly the first time. Do you know what you will? Youwill to observe. You use your senses, you look around, and your will is tograsp, to understand. And you observe similarities. Now, you don’t know yet thatthis is the process of abstraction, and a great many people never graspconsciously that that’s what the process is. But you are engaged in it once youbegin to observe similarities.And although I hesitate to talk about volition on the preconceptuallevel—because the subject isn’t aware of it in those terms—even a preconceptualinfant has the power to look around or not look, to listen or not listen. He hasa certain minimal, primitive form of volition over the function of his senses.But volition in the full sense of a conscious choice, and a choice which he canobserve by introspection, begins when he forms concepts—at the stage where hehas a sufficient conceptual vocabulary to begin to form sentences and drawconclusions, when he can say consciously, in effect, “This table is larger thanthat one”—that he has to do volitionally. If he doesn’t want to, he can skipthat necessity, and you can observe empirically that too many people do, on toowide a scale.Prof. D: This very first time, or these first times, the child makesobservations, and then he finds he has done something which is fait accompli, asit were. And what he was doing, although he didn’t have a name or concept forit, was abstracting.AR: That’s right. He was talking prose and he didn’t know it. That joke [fromMolière] really is very important. In a certain sense, it names a great manypsychological processes.Assuming we give words to what goes on in his preverbal consciousness, all hehas to will is: “I will look. I will see what things are like.” And in thatprocess he makes a discovery: some things have similarities with others and aredifferent from still other things. Now that is a discovery. He doesn’t will itat first. Later the process becomes more conscious, but at first it is adiscovery. What does he use? His senses. His sensory apparatus at that stagefunctions automatically. As he discovers certain things, he begins to direct hissensory apparatus, and that is volitional.Prof. D: So he doesn’t will to abstract; he looks and then he finds he has donesomething that is useful to him. Then he does it again and again, but how doeshe get to the fully conceptual stage?AR: He expands the process. He would say, “By observing, I have seen differencesbetween papers, cups, and tables.” Now some strange, nasty relatives enter theroom, and he could say, “I will now direct my attention to learning what thedifference is between them and my parents.” That he would have to doconsciously.What would be the subverbal process? It would be as follows: “By observingdistinctions and similarities, I have learned a great many things aboutinanimate objects in my room. I can handle them better because I have observedthem. I know that I can drink from a cup but I can’t drink from the table. I candeal with these objects if I observe their characteristics—what they have incommon and in what ways they are different from each other. Now, I am up againsta bewildering experience—people—and there are differences among people,differences which are not so easy to perceive. If I merely look at my mother andmy aunt, I won’t see differences—at least none that tell me something about thetwo entities. I have to do something else. I have to consciously direct myattention to observe. If I don’t like this aunt, what is it about her? But Ilike my mother. Why do I? In what respects are they similar? They are bothwomen. In what respects are they different, since I like one and not the other?And then he might observe: “My mother is gentle and understanding, but this newcreature yells at me or talks baby talk, and I don’t like it.” He might observethat much; but his senses won’t do it automatically. Here he had to decide: “Iwant to understand the difference.” All his senses gave him is a generalizedimpression. To differentiate it, he has to do something by conscious decision.And you can observe that, unfortunately, very few people carry that methodthrough life—particularly with regard to such a complex subject as humancharacter. They do not conceptualize why they like one person and notanother—what the meaning is of their own reaction. It is in that field,particularly, that they stop—and stop very early. And that is very unfortunate.CONCEPTS AS MENTAL EXISTENTSProf. F: In your definition of concept, you use the word “integration.” You say:“A concept is a mental integration of two or more units which are isolatedaccording to a specific characteristic(s) and united by a specific definition.”AR: That’s the generalized definition. The exact definition is the one at thebottom of page 13. [“A concept is a mental integration of two or more unitspossessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particularmeasurements omitted.”]Prof. F: Yes, there again the word “integration” is used. Do you mean that aconcept is a process of integration or, alternatively, that a concept is theproduct of a process of integration?AR: The second. Here I refer to the fact that the result of a process ofconcept-formation is a mental entity, a mental unit, which is an integration ofthe various elements involved in that process. The reason why I used the word“integration” is to indicate that it is not a mere sum but an inseparable sumforming a new mental unit.009 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_009_r1.jpg]Prof. F: If you and I have the same concept, does that mean that the same entityis in both of our minds?AR: If we are both careful and rational thinkers, yes. Or rather, put it thisway: the same entity should be in both of our minds.Prof. F: Okay, taking concepts, therefore, as entities: they do not have spatiallocation, do they?AR: No, I have said they are mental entities.Prof. A: When you say a concept is a mental entity, you don’t mean “entity” inthe sense that a man is an entity, do you?AR: I mean it in the same sense in which I mean a thought, an emotion, or amemory is an entity, a mental entity—or put it this way: a phenomenon ofconsciousness.Prof. A: Wouldn’t you say that consciousness is itself an attribute of man?AR: Right. A faculty of man. And of animals, or at least the middle and higheranimals.010 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_010_r1.jpg]Prof. F: When you form a concept, the concept itself is perfectly determinate,right?AR: In which sense?Prof. F: Even though the concept has been formed by leaving out measurements,the concept is still determinate in the sense that it is subject to the Law ofIdentity.AR: Oh yes.Prof. F: So therefore, in the case of a concept, you have a determinacy which isnon-quantified.AR: Except that a certain category of measurements is retained. Therefore it isquantified to that extent. When you form a concept, you determine what kind ofmeasurements are appropriate. For instance, in the case of the concept “table,”a certain range of measurements is included, but the particular measurements areomitted. So the table may be of any shape or any size, provided it has a flatsurface and supports. You here set a range of measurements of shape to determineyour concept, but you omit the individual measurements.Prof. F: So the difference between the concept and the concrete is that theconcrete has a greater determinacy, right?AR: Are you going from this to the idea that matter is the principle ofindividuation, that everything is one as a kind of Platonic form, but thatmatter constitutes individuals?Prof. F: I’m saying that I’m confused about this particular point.AR: I see. I think the nearest relationship is the relationship of algebraicsymbols to arithmetical numbers. Could you say that arithmetical numbers have agreater determinacy or individuation? Not really.Prof. F: Yes. The algebraic symbol is a variable, and the number which wefinally substitute for the algebraic symbol at the end of the equation is whatwe speak of as the value of that variable. And it is more determinate. Thevariable must be at some place, and yet the specific place is not given.AR: No, a variable can be at any given number of places within the specifiedrange. And to say the number is more determinate introduces a certain kind ofconfusion. Because in a metaphysical sense only concretes exist. Therefore, whenwe form a concept, we cannot say that we have removed it in a certain sense fromindividuality or the existence of concretes. Isn’t there a Platonic element inthe question?The basic overall point would be always to keep in mind that this is a cognitiveprocess, not an arbitrary process; it’s a process of perceiving reality and isgoverned by the rules of reality. Nevertheless, it’s our way of graspingreality; it isn’t reality itself; it’s only a method of acquiring knowledge, amethod of cognition.Prof. B: I see another confusion here. The concept as a mental entity isdeterminate. It’s individual, it has identity, you can measure it in the waythat you discuss in Chapter 4. The concept, if it is formed correctly, has adeterminate reference, which means that it refers to a determinate aspect ofreality. To say that the concept is less determinate than the concrete is totreat the concept as if it were a concrete in reality—AR: Of a different kind, yes. That’s right. That’s the element that is somewhatPlatonic here.Prof. D: It was said that a concept is not a concrete, it is a determinateresult with a determinate reference. Now we do have a concept of “concept,” butI don’t find any concretes that it is relating. Or if I do find concretes, theyare things, existents.AR: No, the referents of the concept “concept” are other concepts. For instance,let’s say you form the concepts “table,” “chair,” “man,” and a few otherconcepts of perceptually given concretes. Then at a certain level you can formthe concept of “concept,” the concretes of which are all your other specific,earlier-formed concepts.Prof. D: But they aren’t concretes, though.AR: They are mental concretes. You are now discussing an integration of mentalentities. “Concept” refers to mental entities. The referents of the concept of“concept” are all the concepts which you have learned [and will ever learn].Prof. D: Then a mental entity is a concrete?AR: As a mental entity, yes. It is a concrete in relation to the widerabstraction which is the concept of “concept.” Take another, similar case: theconcept of “emotion.” What are its concretes? The various emotions which youobserve introspectively, which you are able to conceptualize. And first youconceptualize them individually. You would form the concepts “love,” “hate,”“anger,” “fear,” and then you arrive at the concept “emotion,” the units ofwhich will be these various emotions that you have identified.Prof. D: I misunderstood, then, something that Professor B said. I thought thathe was maintaining that these weren’t really concretes, not even concretes withholes in them, so to speak—not even vague concretes.Prof. B: No, that was the content of the concept. The concept as a mental entitywould have measurements; it would be a certain mental product.AR: A mental entity standing for a certain number of concretes—a concept—is notthe same as the concretes in vague form. Because some schools of philosophy didhold just that—that a concept is a memory of a concrete, only very vague. Yousee a concept is not a vague concrete, it is a mental entity—which means anentity of a different kind, bearing a certain specific relationship to thephysical concretes.Prof. D: But metaphysically, though, the concept is a concrete; it’s a mentalentity. You have a concept of “emotion.” The referents are these various mentalentities, this particular emotion and that particular one. And then the conceptof “emotion” itself is a mental entity in actual being.AR: Yes, you can call it that.Prof. D: So metaphysically, not epistemologically, all we have here areconcretes.AR: If you mean: does such a thing as the concept of “emotion” in a mind reallyexist? Yes, it exists—mentally. And only mentally.Prof. E: Would it be fair to say that a concept qua concept is not a concretebut an integration of concretes, but qua existent it is a concrete integration,a specific mental entity in a particular mind?AR: That’s right. But I kept saying, incidentally, that we can call them “mentalentities” only metaphorically or for convenience. It is a “something.” Forinstance, before you have a certain concept, that particular something doesn’texist in your mind. When you have formed the concept of “concept,” that is amental something; it isn’t a nothing. But anything pertaining to the content ofa mind always has to be treated metaphysically not as a separate existent, butonly with this precondition, in effect: that it is a mental state, a mentalconcrete, a mental something. Actually, “mental something” is the nearest to anexact identification. Because “entity” does imply a physical thing.Nevertheless, since “something” is too vague a term, one can use the word“entity,” but only to say that it is a mental something as distinguished fromother mental somethings (or from nothing). But it isn’t an entity in theprimary, Aristotelian sense in which a primary substance exists.We have to agree here on the terminology, because we are dealing with a verydifficult subject for which no clear definitions have been established. Ipersonally would like to have a new word for it, but I am against neologisms.Therefore I think the term “mental unit” or “mental entity” can be used,provided we understand by that: “a mental something.”Prof. A: I think I can give an analogy to clarify the two perspectives on“concept” that had been confused. Suppose you have a map of a city. In relationto that city, the map is generalized: it doesn’t include the shape of specifichouses, every little curve in the street, etc. But if you look at the map notinsofar as it refers to the city, but just as a piece of paper with lines andcolors on it, it is entirely specific. It doesn’t have any little regions ofvagueness or non-identity.AR: That’s a very good comparison. Yes, that is correct.IMPLICIT CONCEPTSProf. G: The question I have deals with the concept “implicit.” I want first toget at the general notion of “implicit” and then its meaning in the notions of“implicit concept,” “implicit measurement,” etc.AR: Well, I would like to state my general definition, and then let’s examineit.The “implicit” is that which is available to your consciousness but which youhave not conceptualized. For instance, if you state a certain proposition,implicit in it are certain conclusions, but you may not necessarily be aware ofthem, because a special, separate act of consciousness is required to draw theseconsequences and grasp conceptually what is implied in your original statement.The implicit is that which is available to you but which you have notconceptualized.Prof. G: This is one of the points I want to get at. In both Chapter 1 and otherparts of your book, you use the concept “implicit” to talk about “implicitconcepts,” “implicit knowledge,” and “implicit measurement-omission.” Now, Ithought I could observe that there were several senses of “implicit,” both as itis actually used in ordinary discussions and in your own discussions. What Iwould like to understand is in what sense or senses you were using the term ineach of the above cases.AR: Remember, we are not linguistic analysts here.Prof. G: I don’t think there is any assumption of that. I am not a linguisticanalyst.AR: Okay.Prof. G: Take the notion of “implicit measurement-omission.” There seem to betwo senses of “implicit” here. One sense could be that there is some form ofawareness or recognition, but not an explicit formulation, of the process ofmeasurement-omission. I know you don’t hold that. But, for example, you couldsay that when concepts are formed, there is a certain form of awareness orrecognition that something like measurement-omission is involved, but one can’texplicitly state the fact that the concepts are formed throughmeasurement-omission.The other sense of “implicit” would be not that there is some form of awarenessor recognition—that might not be present at all—but the sense of “implicit” inwhich something is presupposed by, or is a condition for, something else. Ithink this might be present in axiomatic concepts, for example. When you saythat axiomatic concepts are implicit in all knowledge, the sense of “implicit”there might also include the notion that axiomatic concepts have a relationshipto other concepts in a hierarchy—there is a logical connection between axiomaticconcepts and other concepts. And I think that the nature of the relationshiphere would be that axiomatic concepts are presupposed in higher concepts.AR: I would have to ask you what you mean by “presuppose.” Normally,“presuppose” means that you cannot hold concept A unless you have first graspedconcept B. There is an almost chronological projection here—if you do not graspB, you cannot grasp A. That is what “presuppose” means. That isn’t the samething as “implicit.”Prof. G: Then I was just wrong on that.AR: You are wrong on the second but, as near as I understand you, you are righton the first: “implicit” is a knowledge which is available to you but which youhave not yet grasped consciously. And by “grasped consciously” I mean: broughtinto conceptual terms. You have not identified it conceptually. So that, if Isay that “existence” is implicit in the first awareness, I mean the materialfrom which the concept “existence” will come is present, but the child justlearning concepts would not be able to form the concept “existence” until he hasformed a sufficient number of concepts of particular existents.Prof. G: What I would like to do is to get a better understanding of the natureof that awareness. Let’s consider the notion of “implicit concept.” You state,on page 6, that when one has an implicit concept, one grasps the constituents ofwhat may later be integrated into a concept.AR: Yes.Prof. G: Now, I take it that, in this sense of “implicit,” there is a form ofawareness here which is below the level of the explicit. There is no formulationon the part of the person involved.AR: It simply means just what I said. It is not yet conceptualized, but it isavailable. Therefore, if you substitute the definition “conceptualized or not”for “explicit and implicit,” it will be perfectly clear.Prof. G: Why do you identify this type of awareness as an implicit concept?There seems to be an obvious objection that the notion of “implicit concept” isa contradiction in terms. For you to have a concept, there must be some form ofintegration, and you are speaking here only of an awareness which is avowedlynot integrated; it is just an awareness of the units themselves.Prof. E: May I make one brief observation? If I follow the drift of yourcomment, you would also say that it is a self-contradiction to describe afertilized egg in the womb as a “potential man,” because a man is defined as arational animal and the egg is not yet a rational animal; so we are applying anadjective to a noun where the adjective, out of context, doesn’t allow for thedefining characteristic of the noun. Is that the drift of your argument? Becauseon the face of it that seems awfully linguistic-analytical to me. That is, youjust observe the conjunction of an adjective and a noun, and divorce italtogether from the content of the two concepts.AR: I am afraid so.Prof. G: It would be like saying that calling a fertilized egg a “potential man”is a contradiction in terms. That’s helpful.Let me ask a related question. Would you want to maintain that animals, which dohave an awareness of the units, would have implicit concepts?AR: No, because conceptualization as such is not possible to them.Prof. G: So the notion of implicit concept presupposes the awareness of aconceptual being.AR: It presupposes a consciousness capable of conceptualization.011 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_011_r1.jpg]Prof. B: Would you say that a child has an implicit concept of “table” at thestage when he has isolated the differentiating characteristics of tables but hasnot yet integrated them?AR: At any stage before he is ready to grasp the word “table.” An implicitconcept is the stage of an integration when one is in the process of formingthat integration and until it is completed.Prof. B: Any time after he detects the similarities and differences?AR: Right. What has to be clearly delimited is only this: not everything that isaround you is an implicit concept. For instance, subatomic physics is operativethere in the room which the infant first observes, but you can’t say that itsconcepts are implicit merely because when he reaches college age he will graspthem. They are not implicit concepts. An implicit concept is the stage, thatperiod of time whatever it might be, when a child is actually focusing on acertain group of concretes, isolating them from the rest of his field, and/orintegrating them. And that’s not all done instantaneously: it is a process. Itis in that process that the future concept is implicit.THE ROLE OF WORDSWORDS AND CONCEPTSProf. F: On page 16, you refer to words as being themselves concepts. Do youmean that literally? For instance, you say that prepositions are concepts. Doyou mean that prepositions stand for concepts? Is this a shorthand way of sayingthat?AR: Oh yes, certainly. I have stated that words are perceptual symbols whichstand for these products of the mental integrations.And in case this isn’t clear, I would like to add one thing. Why did I say“perceptual”? Because words are available to us either visually or auditorially.They are given to us in sensory, perceptual form. And by means of grasping them,on the perceptual level, we are able to operate with concepts as single mentalunits. In other words, every time we think of the concept “table,” we don’t haveto add up the sum of all the tables we have seen or visualize them. “Table” as asound or a visual image is on the perceptual level. Mentally, it stands for thatparticular integration of concretes which we have called “table.”So the word is not the concept, but the word is the auditory or visual symbolwhich stands for a concept. And a concept is a mental entity; it cannot beperceived perceptually. That’s the role played by words.Prof. D: On page 19, you say: “The process of forming a concept is not completeuntil its constituent units have been integrated into a single mental unit bymeans of a specific word.” Now this seems to imply that words precedeconcepts—that without the word there wouldn’t be the concept. But you also speakof words “designating” concepts and words “symbolizing” concepts—which seems toimply that the word does not precede the concept. Again, you say on page 10:“Every word ... is a symbol which denotes a concept.” This passage seems to havethe same implication: a denial that the word is first and the concept second.AR: Most emphatically, I did not mean that words precede concepts. And I wouldlike to know what gave you that impression—because even the sentence you quotedfrom page 19 made clear, I thought, that the word comes at the end of a processof conceptualization, not at the beginning. One’s mind first has to grasp theisolation and the integration which represents the formation of a concept; butto complete that process—and particularly to retain it, and later to automatizeit—a man needs a verbal symbol. But as far as the process of concept-formationis concerned, the word is the result of the process.Prof. D: So the concept would be formed prior to the introduction of the word,and the word would be used as a device for retaining the concept?AR: That is a word’s main function, but its function is not merely that. I meantexactly what I said: to complete the process. Let me make this a little clearer.Suppose a child is forming the concept “table.” First, he has to isolate a tablefrom the rest of his perceptual concretes, then integrate it with other tables.Now, in this process words are not present yet, because he is merely observing,and performing a certain mental process. It is after he has fully grasped thatthese particular objects (tables) are special and different in some way from allthe other objects he perceives—it is then that he has to firm up, in effect, hismental activity in his own mind by designating that special status of theseparticular objects in some sensory form [i.e., by means of a word].It is for the purpose not only of retaining the concept but also of making andcompleting the process of concept-formation that he has to designate the tablesby some kind of sensory symbol. The main function of doing so is to enable himto retain the concept and be able to use it subsequently. But even apart fromthe future, in the process of forming that concept, in order for it not toremain a momentary impression or observation which then vanishes—in order tomake it in a concept-forming process—he has to identify what he has justobserved in some one, concrete, specific, sensory form.This probably becomes somewhat clearer in the chapter on the cognitive role ofconcepts, but I would ask you all to keep in mind that a very important part ofmy entire theory is what I call unit-economy: the substitution of one mentalunit for an indefinite number of concretes of a certain kind. That is theessence of why we need concepts—that is the essence of what concepts do for us.Therefore, the substitution of one unit which refers to x number of possibleunits is the essence of concept-formation. The process is not complete withoutthat substitution.Prof. D: So until the word was interposed, there would not in the strict sensebe a concept?AR: Right.Prof. D: Then I take it that the process is as follows. An integration occurswhich cannot yet be said to be a concept. And a sound, a sensuous concrete, isintroduced to hold down, so to speak, this integration. And at that point thesound, as being used to hold down this integration, becomes a word whose meaningis the integration.AR: Oh no. The meaning is not the integration. The integration is the process.The meaning is the objects which are being isolated and integrated. The meaningof the word is always metaphysical, in the sense of its referents, notpsychological. The meaning of the word is out there in existence, in reality.The process that one had to perform in order to arrive at that meaning, and atthat integration, is psychological.I want to stress this; it is a very important distinction. A great number ofphilosophical errors and confusions are created by failing to distinguishbetween consciousness and existence—between the process of consciousness and thereality of the world outside, between the perceiver and the perceived.Therefore, it’s very important here, if the issue arises at all, to stressemphatically that a concept and its symbol, the word, stands for certainobjective referents—for existents outside, in reality. And in the case ofconcepts of consciousness, one’s own consciousness serves as the observer andthe processes of consciousness as the observed, as the object which one observesand integrates. But in either case, whether it is concepts of outside existentsor of one’s own consciousness, the concepts always refer to some facts which oneis conceptualizing, and never to one’s method or process.Prof. D: Then would this do as the statement of the process? One integrates,then introduces a sensuous concrete holding the integration. At that point thesound or the sensuous concrete becomes a word whose meaning is the objectsintegrated.AR: That’s right.Prof. D: And at the same time one has for the first time a concept.AR: That’s right. I also want to stress what I said earlier: the essentialnature and purpose of the process of concept-formation is unit-economy. Andtherefore when a great number of concretes, an indefinitely large number, hasbeen transformed into one unit, then the process is completed.Now, it has to be a specific unit; and it cannot be specific, it cannot beconcrete, unless it is sensuous. Because reality is concrete, and we perceive bymeans of our senses. Suppose we attempted to have a concept which was symbolizedby a certain feeling. Let’s say that I have a feeling of combined pleasure anddisgust at the concept “table” —suppose I tried to hold that concept by means ofsuch a feeling. Needless to say, that would not be a concept. It would not lastbeyond the mood of the moment. And I would not have performed the most importantpart of the process—namely, the substitution of one handleable, perceivable,firm, objective unit for the enormity which I want to subsume under thisconcept.012 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_012_r1.jpg]Prof. D: There’s still some puzzlement concerning the difference between “unit”and “concept.” Take the stage of concept-formation where a child regards certainentities as resembling each other. A child is observing these three notepads,and they are just entities so long as he does not show that he is treating themas distinct from other objects.AR: Okay.Prof. D: But now he notices similarities and differences, and treats these asrelated together and distinguished from some other things. So these threeobjects are at this point units. But has he thereby arrived at the point ofconceptualizing them? As far as I can see there is one more step involved inthis unification, according to the definition given of “concept” on page 10: “Aconcept is a mental integration of two or more units which are isolatedaccording to specific characteristics and united by a specific definition.”AR: Aren’t you confusing two aspects here? The definition on page 10 refers towhat a concept is—it refers to the product of the process. But now you aredescribing the process. Well now, as a process yes, you first have to separatethem as you described. And in the process of deciding that these three havesomething in common and are different from others, you are treating them as aunit. You are now looking at them not only as three blue objects, but threeunits of one group that have something in common as against everything else.Prof. D: I’ve described the process, but I have arrived also at a product whichis: these regarded as units. Now at that point do I have the concept of “pad,”or do I still have something further to do, a further integration to make,before the product would be a concept?AR: Yes. You have to give it a name.Prof. D: Oh, give it a name—not “united by a specific definition”?AR: A definition would be involved in more complex subjects, but on the firstlevel, you don’t have to have a definition. None of us would use a definition of“table,” but in fact a definition is possible. In regard to a higher complexityof concepts, however, you couldn’t possibly hold it in mind beyond a moment,without giving it a definition.But here, as you described the process of forming a concept of three perceptualentities, when you’ve reached the point you described—that is, you now regardthem as units of one group—that knowledge as such is not going to be a conceptin your mind, for the following reason. In order to hold the group, you stillhave to mentally project, visualize, or deal with three entities. Therefore youare not yet mentally out of the stage of perceptual awareness.Prof. D: In other words, at this stage there would be just this perceptualgroup.AR: That’s exactly what you would have: a perceptual group.Prof. D: Now suppose I hadn’t given them a name yet, and I go to another room.And there are some more of these notepads on a table. Would it mean that Iwouldn’t identify these, just automatically, as related?—that I would have to gothrough this integration over again, and then that integration would again bejust at the perceptual level?AR: No, it depends on how bright a child you are. I suspect—strictly byempirical observation—that a child does precisely this before he’s ready tolearn to speak. That is, to grasp that a word identifies a certain group ofobjects, he would probably be doing exactly what you describe. He would observesomething in common in these pads, and then he goes into another room and hesees two more. He might connect them in his mind, so that if he could state hismental process, it would amount to: “Oh, these are something like the three Isaw in the other room.” Only he wouldn’t have any of these words nor the concept“three.” But it would be precisely by observing certain objects more than onceand not necessarily only in one room—it’s precisely by learning todifferentiate, which I believe takes quite a period of time—that a child becomesready to form the concept fully, which happens when he finds a word for it.Prof. D: Now suppose this child tasted these, but he still doesn’t have anywords. And he tastes them and he likes them. But later when there aren’t any inthe room, he starts squalling. And his mother runs around wondering how to quiethim. She tries bringing him different objects, but nothing quiets him. And thenshe brings him one of these pads, and that quiets him, and he starts eating it.And so she says, “Why, he was crying for the pad all along.” But he stilldoesn’t have a name for these things. Isn’t this behavior indicative of hisapproaching these now open-endedly? There wasn’t even one in the room, and hewas crying for it. And so one would have to say that even without a name theseare being treated in an open-ended way rather than a purely perceptual way?AR: Only to this extent: what you are describing is exactly the preconceptualstage. That is the mind in process. At the end of that process, he will be readyto grasp that a word names these objects.Otherwise, observe the following. Infants in the first weeks of life are notable to learn words. Before they begin to speak, you observe that they arebeginning to make sounds, inarticulate sounds, as if they were trying tocommunicate something. Therefore some enormous amount of information is alreadyin their mind—perceptual information on its way to becoming conceptualized orbrought into conceptual order. But in order for it to become a concept, theinfant has to acquire some method of identifying the total of these objectsconceptually. That’s the purpose that a word serves. Because if he doesn’t havea word, he will be tied to his perceptual material.So assuming for a moment that he could learn to speak but without concepts, hewould have to say to his mother the equivalent of: “I want another one of thoseblue objects which I saw day before yesterday.” But he can’t say any of that,nor can he hold it in his mind that way for very long.Therefore, if your question is: at what point does this preliminary mentalactivity become a full-fledged concept? I say it becomes that when the childlearns that a perceptual symbol—remember that a sound or the visual shape of aword is a percept—when he learns that that percept stands for all thoseconcretes that he’s trying to integrate.Prof. D: The word takes him beyond the perceptual level because now he’s notlimited to the five pads he saw. But even without the word, though, in the caseof the child I was referring to, isn’t he already beyond the five pads he saw?He might have eaten the five.AR: He wouldn’t be there to ask for the sixth if he did.Prof. D: But suppose he does the next day, though. He knows they are gone, andhe’s howling, and when he’s brought a new one he’s satisfied. And he smiles whenhe sees it being brought. Let’s suppose that the presence of a word is necessaryfor the existence of a concept. Is it because the word open-ends the unificationgoing on?AR: It ends the process.Prof. D: Didn’t he already have it open-ended without the word? He went on tonew ones.AR: He has an open-ended identification from memory. He might remember thatthere were blue pads, and he would like more blue pads. But he couldn’t holdmore than, well, let’s say five identifications of that kind. Maybe he’llremember the five pads and two ashtrays and three pens. But if each time he hasto hold it by a visual type of memory, or by taste if he’s eaten it, without anyother form of identification, it would be impossible for him to progress beyondthat stage.Prof. D: You say that the word, then, permits him to let go, as it were, ofvisual memory. The word, though, is a sound that is denoting the concept, i.e.,this group of things in an open-ended way.AR: Right.Prof. D: But now the meaning of the sound, then, is what it denotes.AR: Right.Prof. D: But what it denotes will have to be present to his mind.AR: Well, certainly. But not every instance of it.Prof. D: No, but what will be present to his mind again would be perceptualmemories, wouldn’t it?AR: At first just the memory of one blue pad; as his conceptual development goeshigher: the essential characteristics of the concretes which form the units of agiven concept. It isn’t that he lets go of concretes in the sense that he nolonger has to know what his concept refers to. But he doesn’t have to carry inmind the specific memory of all the different concretes of that kind which hehas observed.Prof. D: Now every entity, mental and otherwise, is a concrete existent.AR: That’s right.Prof. D: So that related to the sound can only be some concrete existents thatare present to his mind.AR: Not if it’s a sound which he accepts as standing for an unlimited class ofspecific, concrete existents. The sound has a crucial distinction from just anoise in nature. He learns to understand its meaning as: the word—the concrete,if you wish—that names an unlimited number of existents.Prof. D: Could I pursue my question from a slightly different angle? Suppose wenow have a sound which supplies us with a perceptual concrete, and we relatethis sound to this open-ended group—to these things and things like it.AR: That’s right.Prof. D: And the sound is just a perceptual concrete that serves for my makingthis relation. Why would a word, a sound, be needed? Why couldn’t I use, say,just one of the perceptual concretes of this kind and respond to it asrepresenting “that and anything like it”? It’s not a word, it’s just one of theperceptual concretes held visually.AR: Then I would ask you: how long could you continue this process? Assuming nowthat you have no words at all, but you are able to hold it by this kind ofmethod. Instead of a sound, you deal with a visual memory of a pad plus theparenthetical implication “and other objects like this.” Now how would youproceed beyond the level of identifying objects?Prof. D: Isn’t that all I’d have to do at the most basic level ofconceptualization—just be able to identify in my mind such and such pads andthings like the pads that I consider concretely? And why couldn’t I use simply anon-verbal concrete to hang these relations on?AR: You could, up to a certain point. And I’m sure that that’s what childrenbegin with. But after you have identified a certain number of perceptually givenobjects, then you want to establish relationships, let us say. Well, how wouldyou do it? By the equivalent of what? You would have to say “length” is thatattribute which I see in—then visual image: table, visual image: pad, visualimage: street—and you’d stop right there.The principle involved here is unit-economy. The proper answer to your questioncomes in the book where I discuss what I call the “crow-epistemology”: the factthat any consciousness—animal or human—can deal mentally with only so many units[in one frame of awareness]. And observe on an adult level: you know that youcould not deal with all of your knowledge in any one instant of time, that youcan handle only so many aspects of a subject, you can hold it in the focus ofyour attention only so long and no more. In other words, no human mind has thecapacity to hold all of its knowledge simultaneously.Therefore, the question becomes: how much can a mind handle if one has toconstantly carry images of concretes? How much if, when you identify or try toanalyze any aspect or attribute of these concretes, you have to do it by holdingthese mental images? From the aspect of the capacity of a human consciousness,it would be enormously restricted. Whereas what the substitution of words forimages does is enable you to handle a total as a single unit.That’s probably the most important aspect of why human beings have concepts.What purpose do they serve? Why can we learn and do much more than animals can?Precisely because by conceptual means we substitute one concrete for anunlimited number of concretes. If you want to concentrate on the concept“table,” you can learn an enormous amount about how to build a table, how to useit, what you can do with it, how to change and make variations on tables. Whatmakes that type of thinking possible? Only the fact that you do not have tocarry in mind a concrete image.Otherwise, you’d have to have a concrete image of table, of length, of weight,of color, of shape, and I don’t know how many other things would be involved.That cannot be done, simply because a mind cannot hold that much together.And more than that; the fact that Aristotle is right and not Plato is veryrelevant here: abstractions, as such, do not exist. Only concretes exist. Wecould not deal with a sum of concrete objects constantly without losing ourgrasp of them. But what do we do conceptually? We substitute a concrete—a visualor auditory concrete—for the unlimited, open-ended number of concretes whichthat new concrete subsumes.Now observe an interesting issue: a case like Helen Keller. She couldn’t useeither auditory or visual symbols. She had to be taught tactile symbols. She hadto learn some mental condensation, some form of perceptual substitution orperceptual shorthand in order to be able to grasp the perceptual world at all.She had only tactile means. And she learned, and she was able to communicate,even to think and write. But prior to the time of learning this type of physicalsymbol, she was not able to grasp or deal with anything [conceptually], as faras could be observed. Therefore I wouldn’t say the symbol has to be auditory orvisual. If a mind is born handicapped in a certain way, there can be asubstitute. Assuming a healthy child, the auditory and visual symbols are theeasiest and the most productive. You can do more by that method. But some othermethod has to do if a person is handicapped.The principle here is that in order to deal with a wide range of knowledge, youhave to reduce the concretes to a single concrete, a concrete of a differentorder, a symbolic concrete. But that symbolic concrete has to be perceptual; itcannot be held in some undefined terms. It can be held that way just long enoughfor you to grasp the concept but not beyond it.Prof. E: If you tried to represent the whole class by means of the image of oneof the particular concretes in the class, wouldn’t you be forced to the positionthat every time you wanted to employ the concept you’d have to re-form it?AR: In a way.Prof. E: He suggested, for instance, that you could say, “It’s this or anythinglike it.” But you obviously imply: like it in some respects. Because there aremany things like it in other respects which wouldn’t represent that class. Soyou’d have to remind yourself of the particular respect. Which would require youto say, “Well, I mean the sort of thing it has in common with those.” So you’dhave to recall those concretes and re-perform the abstracting process. Whereas,when you use a word, you retain the essence of what’s in common without beingtied to one concrete and without being required to ignore its particularconcreteness in order to use it as a symbol.AR: That’s right. That’s absolutely true.013 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_013_r1.jpg]Prof. D: There are some questions that arise in my mind concerning thedenotation of words and the denotation of concepts in this connection. On page13, one reads that, “The first words a child learns are words denoting visualobjects.”AR: The first ones, yes.Prof. D: If the essential function of words is to denote concepts, and if theexpression “words denote visual objects” states their essential function, itwould look as if one could deduce that concepts are visual objects.AR: Well, one could do that, if one dropped the context. But, you see, I do notthink that any information can be conveyed by any one sentence out of context.If it could be, we wouldn’t need to write a book. Therefore, when you read aparticular sentence, you have to take cognizance of the context which has beenestablished.Now here the context has been established that the word denotes a concept whichin turn denotes the objects it subsumes. There can be no such thing as a conceptwithout the objects to which it refers. And conversely, a sound, if it is to bea word, cannot denote objects directly, without representing a concept. (A wordwhich did that would be a proper name.) But a concept is only a mental unit, asymbol, for a number of concretes of a certain kind. Therefore, when I say wordsdenote visual objects, I do not have to repeat: “Don’t forget that the visualobjects have been conceptualized, and the word is the result of that process andnames all those visual objects.” Otherwise, I would have to repeat everypreceding sentence in every sentence I write.Prof. D: Granted, then, that concepts denote objects in reality and that theconcept is a mental unit, I wonder whether it isn’t in some kind of indirectsense that words denote objects—indirectly, via the concept—with the directmeaning of the word being the concept, the integration.AR: I don’t think we can make that distinction. A word which is not a propername does refer directly to an indefinite number of concrete objects. A concept,in the form of a word, refers to them directly, not indirectly.Prof. D: The word refers to the objects directly so that the objects directlyconstitute the meaning of the word?AR: That’s right.Prof. D: Then suppose Descartes’ evil demon waved his wand and those objectswere put out of existence, would this mean that the word wouldn’t have anymeaning?AR: If Descartes’ evil demon existed, nothing would have any meaning, and wecouldn’t have a science of epistemology. We have to deal with reality as it is.If we project a different kind of reality, then nothing we say or do would beapplicable.Prof. D: But if the objects themselves are the word’s meaning, then if you doaway with the objects, you would find that the word has become just ameaningless sound.AR: What do you mean, “do away with”? Do you mean that the objects cease toexist, or that they vanish as if they had never existed?Prof. D: Suppose that these cups on this table are all of the cups that exist inthe world. Then they constitute the meaning of the word “cup.” And now I shut myeyes. While my eyes are shut, somebody waves a magic wand or whatever andactually destroys the cups. Then the meaning of the word “cup” has beendestroyed. So as I shut my eyes the word “cup” will become simply a sound.AR: Now wait. To continue on the terms of your example, the important questionhere would be: what happens to your memory under these conditions? If youremember that there were cups, and now somehow they have disappeared, theconcept still has meaning—as a memory. The person waving the wand would alsohave to erase your memory of such existents. If he could do that, then of coursethe concept and the meaning would disappear.Prof. D: But then suddenly the meaning of “cup” would change from these cups tocups past. And then you have to suppose that past cups are objects in reality.AR: Consider all the people born in the eighteenth century, let us say—men whocouldn’t possibly be alive today. When you use the word “man” in reference tothem, the concept “man” stands for existing men, even though they do not existnow. The meaning of a concept includes, as I have said repeatedly, not only allthe present referents but also all the future ones that anyone might consider,and all the past instances. The meaning remains the same, the nature of thereferents remains the same, that which they have in common with present men (andwhich made you include them in the concept “man”) remains the same, even thoughthe particular physical concretes are not there any longer.Prof. D: Well, I certainly agree to that. But if you equate the meaning of theword with the existents, if you make that theoretic move—AR: The meaning of the word includes all the instances of that existent.Specifically and emphatically not only the presently existing referents, but allthe referents of that kind, past, present, and future. If a concept did not dothat, it would not be a concept—you could form it today, but you could not useit tomorrow, and you could not use it to think about yesterday.014 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_014_r1.jpg]Prof. B: I want to get clearer on the distinction between a concept and what youcall a “qualified instance” of a concept. How would you classify “stationerysupplies” in that regard?AR: That is a qualified instance of a concept; it is used as if it were aconcept, but it is a compound concept.Prof. B: What would turn it into a concept?AR: If we had a special word for it.Prof. B: Just as the phrase “Conceptual Common Denominator” became a concept byreducing it to “CCD”?AR: Yes, that’s right.Prof. B: If the phrase “stationery supplies” became, in effect, one unit—if youhyphenated it, so to speak, then it would become a concept?AR: That’s right.WORDS AND PROPOSITIONSProf. F: My question is about the relationship between concepts andpropositions. Concepts are logically prior, aren’t they?AR: Yes.Prof. F: If every concept is based upon a definition, isn’t that definitionitself a proposition?AR: Oh yes.Prof. F: Well then, the concept is in this case based on a proposition.AR: No, but the first concepts are not. First-level concepts, concepts ofperceptual concretes, are held without definitions. And I even mentioned in thebook that most people would find it very difficult to define the commonplace,easy, first-level concepts for that very reason. They are held first without anydefinitions, mainly in visual form, or through other sensory images. By the timeyou accumulate enough of them, you can progress to propositions, to making useof your concepts, organizing them into sentences which communicate something.And the concepts you form from then on, which are abstractions fromabstractions, those you couldn’t hold visually; they require formal definitions.But by the time you get to them, you are already capable of formingpropositions.And observe that that’s true even by simple empirical verification: if you seehow a child learns to speak, he doesn’t start by uttering sentences. He firstutters single words, and then after a while, when he has enough of them, hebegins to try to communicate in sentences.Prof. F: Most concepts, then, involve definitions which are propositions. Butdon’t definitions, in turn, come down to simple, ostensive—AR: At the start, to ostensive definitions, yes.Prof. B: It is still true that every concept is prior to any proposition thatcontains that concept. You have to have the concept before you can use it in aproposition. You can’t utter a proposition with the word “man” unless you havealready formed the concept of “man.” Putting it that way, doesn’t it removewhatever question you had?Prof. F: Yes.AR: There is something I would like to add. There is a passage in the book whereI said every concept stands for a number of implicit propositions. And even so,chronologically we have to acquire concepts first, and then we begin to learnpropositions. Logically implicit in a concept is a proposition, only a childcouldn’t possibly think of it. He doesn’t have the means yet to say, “By theword ‘table’ I mean such and such category of existents [with all theircharacteristics].” But that is implicit in the process. And that is importantwhen you get to Kant—and to the whole analytic-synthetic dichotomy—that everyconcept represents such an implicit proposition, logically. But that doesn’tmean that a child has to learn simultaneously concepts and propositions.Take, for instance, a simple concept of the first, perceptual level, like“table.” Implicit in the use of the word “table,” and in the grasping or formingof that concept, is the [definitional] proposition: “By the sound ‘table,’ Imean objects whose distinguishing characteristic is a flat surface andsupports.” Now, a child doesn’t have any of those concepts, but what does he do?Implicitly, he uses the word “table,” once he has learned it, in that manner.Prof. B: When you say the proposition is implicit, you mean implicit in the wayyou use it, that is: the material is available. And doesn’t the relevantmaterial include facts such as that the table is flat? That fact isimplicit—meaning: you have to grasp that fact perceptually before you can form“table,” and isn’t that part of the concept?AR: Yes. But here it isn’t only a matter of what is involved in the concept, butalso in the way the child uses the concept before he can form propositions, orthe way an adult uses it in a fully conscious way. Implicit in every concept is“By this sound I mean such and such category of existents.”Prof. B: But wouldn’t you agree that implicit in every concept are all thepropositions stating all the facts he needed to form that concept?AR: That’s right.Prof. F: But isn’t a proposition by its very nature complex, that is, made up oftwo or more concepts?AR: Oh yes.Prof. F: But then how can you say that every concept expresses a proposition?AR: Implicitly. The material is there but a child cannot yet form it, preciselybecause he needs to form each concept separately before he can unite them.Prof. E: In other words, you can hold complex information, sufficiently complexto generate a proposition, in a perceptual form.Prof. F: But if every concept is based upon a complex operation like this, thenin the very process of forming a concept you must have gone through this complexexperience.AR: Well, of course.Prof. E: But you only identify the elements of what you are doing when you reachthe stage of epistemology.AR: I think I’ve indicated that in the book, when I say the following: a childfirst has to grasp the concept of entities before he can grasp actions orattributes; yet, to separate entities from each other he has to be aware ofattributes. He has to separate tables from chairs, let’s say, by seeing thatthey have different shapes. Now he is aware of attributes, perceptually. He hasnot yet conceptualized why he thinks tables are different from chairs. He merelyobserves that, and he says, in effect, “This is table; this is chair.” Then whenhe has learned such abstractions as “shape,” and “difference,” and a great manyothers, he can consciously, in conceptual terms, identify the things which atfirst were observed perceptually.All our knowledge, you see, begins perceptually, and the whole process ofconcept-formation rests on isolating, one step at a time, objects from anenormous field. We are aware, let’s say, of a whole room, but we can’t form allthe concepts involved at the same time. It has to be done one at a time.Incidentally, what is also very important here is that since reality is not acollection of discrete concretes which have nothing to do with each other, sinceit is actually an integrated, interrelated whole, the same is true of ourconceptual equipment. We cannot begin to use it until we have enoughinterrelated concepts to permit us, beginning with a small vocabulary, to reachhigher and higher distinctions. Observe that all concepts on the first,perceptual level are enormously interrelated. And it would be impossible to saythat we have to conceptualize tables first or chairs first. Or inanimate objectsin the room before persons. There would be no rule about it.Everything is interrelated, and for a concept to become fully and consciouslyclear to a child, to a mind just starting, he needs several other concepts. Heis in an accelerating period of transition now. At first he might be able to sayjust “table” and “Mama.” But very quickly his vocabulary enlarges, becauseeverything is connected in some way or related to everything else in his fieldof knowledge, and as he clarifies his first concepts, the process of formingothers becomes easier. But before he begins to speak he has to acquire a greatmany of them because they are all interrelated.And the difficulty there is that before he can form propositions, he needsadjectives and verbs—particutarty verbs—and that is a very difficult mentalfeat, really, to go from nouns, which are fairly easy, to verbs, which stand foractions, and then to qualities (i.e., adjectives).015 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_015_r1.jpg]Prof. D: You say that one’s mind is able to encompass only so many units—five orsix. What then happens when we are discussing something, as we are now? I amtalking in sentences, and there are a lot of concepts that must be evoked inorder for you to understand what I am saying. Now, as I go from word to word,does a concept come into being and then go out of existence? And if so, how doyou understand the first part of my sentence when I am at the end? How do youkeep so many things in mind?AR: What’s the problem here? How much we can hold at one time?Prof. D: I present it as a kind of dilemma.AR: As a dilemma?!Prof. D: I am speaking in sentences, and each sentence contains various wordswhich are denoting concepts. This means that as I speak now, in order for you tounderstand what I am saying, each word has to evoke a particular concept. Andthat concept will either continue to exist in time or it will cease to exist,say, when the next word comes. Now, in the latter case, I wonder how anyoneunderstands a sentence, because the first part of the sentence with all itsconcepts is long over and gone at the end. On the other hand, if all theseconcepts continue to exist, one after the other, so that they are all theretogether finally at the end, I would have so many entities present in my mind Icouldn’t hold them.AR: Isn’t the issue here an equivocation on “the existence of a concept”? Inyour example, you are assuming that the concept exists only for the specificsplit second when it is invoked. You are assuming that a concept does not existprior to the moment of your uttering it and stops existing the moment you go tothe next word, which empirically is not true. If we talk of the existence of aconcept, we have to say that it exists in a man’s mind so long as he is able tobring it into his full conscious attention.Certainly your entire vocabulary is not constantly in the focus of yourconscious attention. But it is available to you the moment you need it. It iscertainly clear that when you are uttering a sentence, you are using conceptswhich do exist in our minds, and we are able to recognize and hold them for thelength of your sentence—particularly if the sentence is grammatical.You know that we do communicate, and that we are able to follow an argument, andthat you cannot tell us everything at once. That is what we have words for,first, then words organized in sentences, then paragraphs, and then sequencesand volumes. We have to focus gradually and in installments, if you arepresenting a very complex issue.Therefore there is no dilemma at all about the fact that we are able to read abook and understand what it’s about. Or that we are able to hear an entirespeech or a single sentence. How can it be a dilemma, when we know that it’s afact? It can be a dilemma only on the basis of our arbitrarily rewritingreality.Prof. D: Well I didn’t mean that the fact was a dilemma, but if I have presenteda certain theory concerning the fact, I could very well be in a dilemma if mytheory had some defect in it.AR: That’s right.Prof. D: So what I am attempting to do is to see how in terms of the Objectivisttheory of concepts one would explain the fact that we do, of course, understandthe sentence. Now, you said that as I utter my sentence, these existents called“concepts” do not cease to exist the moment the word is uttered and gone, butthat they are held throughout the sentence. But then I was wondering whether onewouldn’t be confronted with an overloading of one’s capacity to consider items.Suppose I utter the following sentence: “A child is not and does not have to beaware of all these complexities when he forms the concept ‘table.’ ” Well, thereare twenty-one concepts I’m holding in my mind by the time I get to the end ofthe sentence—twenty-one mental entities are present in my mind. And that wouldseem to be a kind of overloading of my capacity to view things.AR: The answer to how we are able to understand a whole sentence, let alone awhole book, lies in the nature of concepts. Which part of their nature?Automatization. When a concept automatically stands in your mind for a certainkind of concrete, when you don’t have to take the time to remind yourself whatyou mean by the word “table,” by the word “child,” etc., it’s that speed oflightning-like integration of the referents of your concepts to your words thatpermits you to understand a sentence.Prof. B: Isn’t this question really about the theory of propositions, not ofconcepts? There are twenty-one concepts, but the first five of them, say, areintegrated into one clause, and the various clauses are integrated into oneproposition, and that’s how we hold it.AR: Yes.Prof. E: If you just strung out twenty-one words at random from the dictionary,you couldn’t hold them all.AR: Yes.Prof. A: Or if you read that same sentence backward, you wouldn’t be able tohold them either.AR: That’s right.Prof. A: So there’s something going on, when you read the sentence forward, thatenables you to grasp it.Prof. E: The proposition, in effect, becomes a unit itself.AR: Yes.MEASUREMENT, UNIT, AND MATHEMATICSMEASUREMENTProf. F: I would like to raise a question about the measurability of attributes.Length is obviously an attribute and it is measurable. And I am sure thateveryone agrees that hardness and temperature are measurable. But now let’s takethe example of triangularity. And let’s ask if there are such things as degreesof triangularity. It seems to me that a given entity either is a triangle or itis not a triangle.And there’s a related question that you might want to treat at the same time.Sometimes you speak as if every individual, every concrete, is a unit. Did youmean to say that?AR: No. Every concrete is a unit when regarded as a separate member of a groupof two or more similar concretes. A unit is a concrete, an existent, regarded ina certain manner, regarded in a certain relationship. Every concrete is a unitwhen it is so regarded. But that doesn’t mean that every concrete can serve as astandard of measurement. Because “unit” here has two different meanings. A unitselected as a standard of measurement [e.g., the inch] has to be a givenquantity of a given attribute, not of an entity.But now what do you mean by “degrees of triangularity”?—because there is no suchthing.Prof. F: It follows then that for this attribute, triangularity, there is nounit in terms of which it can be measured.AR: No, it does not. Triangularity is one form of two-dimensional shape, andshape can be measured. Triangularity isn’t a special attribute; the attribute isshape. In the case of triangles it is a triangular shape; in the case of squaresit is something else. And all of them have to be measured in terms of linearmeasurement. I even referred to that as an example.Prof. E: It’s interesting that you asked that, because it’s the identicalquestion that I once asked, and I remember what Miss Rand’s answer was at thetime, which made it perfectly clear. Now please correct me, Miss Rand, if myformulation is not one you would endorse.At the time, she distinguished between a simple and a complex attribute. Shesaid that there are things, such as triangularity, which are attributes, in thesense that they can’t exist independently, but which nevertheless have more thanone measurable aspect. And that to measure a complex attribute is not to take aunit of that attribute in itself as the standard of measurement, but to measurethe various distinguishable aspects of that attribute. So that for triangles,you’d have to measure the number of sides, the length of the sides, the angularrelations between them—which sum of aspects constitutes the triangularity. So tomeasure a triangle is no more than to measure the distinguishable aspects of theattribute.In effect, there’s such a thing as a complex attribute, which is still anattribute metaphysically, but is measurable by a different procedure than asimple attribute like length. Would you agree?AR: In a sense. Is that the question about whether you take “little triangles”to measure every triangle?Prof. E: That’s right.Prof F: So there are complex attributes and simple attributes.AR: Well, put it in a somewhat more relevant way. All attributes, in order to bemeasured, have to be reduced to the kind of unit which we can perceive and bymeans of which we can establish a [quantitative] relationship. So if we perceivetwo triangles, by means of measuring them qua triangles we will never getanywhere. It is not possible to measure shapes that way. What would we have todo? Reduce them to linear measurement.But, a point I want to make very clearly: let us not make metaphysicaldistinctions on the basis of our methods of cognition. In other words, to saythat you have to measure shape, for instance, in terms of, ultimately, reducingit to linear measurement is not to say that various shapes possess differentattributes metaphysically. That’s only creating confusion. And to tell you thetruth, I do not quite understand the relevance or the consequences ofdistinctions of this kind—such as simple attributes versus complex ones. Theattributes are what they are; our methods of measuring them may be simple orcomplex.Prof. F: All right. What we called a “complex attribute” is merely due to acomplex method of measurement, right? Would that be correct, to leave it just asan epistemological distinction?AR: I think that, for precision, we’d better say “complex method,” not “complexattribute.” Because “attribute” relates to the existent, “method” relates to ourform of measurement.Prof. F: So can we then conclude this: not every concrete is a unit?AR: Units serving as standards of measurement? Or concretes regarded as units?Which do you mean? Not every concrete can be taken as a standard of measurementqua concrete. A triangle cannot be taken as a standard of measurement fortriangles. But a triangle can be regarded as a unit when we form the concept“triangle.”If we observe various shapes and find a difference between triangles andsquares, how do we separate the two categories? By regarding all triangles asunits of one group and observing that they have a characteristic in common—acertain kind of shape—that distinguishes them from another group which aresquares. In that sense we do regard triangles as units. And in that sense everyexistent—not only every concrete, but also every attribute, every action, everyrelationship—is regarded as a unit when it is unified into a concept.But if I understand you correctly, your question was more pertaining to methodsof measurement. And in that sense, you are correct when you say not everyconcrete can serve as a unit of measurement. And I have indicated that it isn’ta concrete entity that one has to use [as the standard], but an attribute. Wecan’t measure by means of concrete entities ; we measure only by relatingattributes of certain entities to a selected standard of measurement which isthe concrete unit selected as this standard—like an inch or a meter or a mile.That’s a concrete unit of measurement, which represents an attribute, not anentity. Is that your question?Prof. F: Essentially, yes. I just wonder why the term “unit” should be used atall, except in those cases where the thing can be used as a unit of measurement.I’m suggesting that it might be best to simply use the term “concrete” and notthe term “unit.”AR: But the [implicit] concept “unit” is essential to concept-formation. Theessence of the first two pages of the book is to point out that only when welearn, in infancy, to regard concretes as units-only then can we begin to formconcepts. So if there is any verbal confusion, I would say it would be betternot to use the word “unit” for “standard of measurement.” There’s only onedifficulty that would occur there: that which we select as a standard ofmeasurement has to be a unit.Prof. F: Yes. It may be a verbal problem here. You see, what I’m trying to sayis this. A triangle cannot be regarded as a unit of triangularity, butultimately it must be analyzed in terms of extension, length, and so forth.AR: Right.Prof. F: And some of the words that you use led me to think that you might wantto say that a given triangle, because of the fact that it is a unit, istherefore a potential standard of measurement. And this seemed to me obviouslywrong, and that’s why I raised it.AR: But in cases like this, I think we have to rely on the context to establishthe meaning. Because it isn’t arbitrary or purely linguistic that I use such aterm as “unit of measurement.” The mental relationship involved is the same asin regarding individual existents—concretes—as units when we form a concept. Therelationship, the aspect from which we regard it, is the same. But that doesn’tnecessarily imply that every concrete existent can be a unit [of measurement].If we say that only units of attributes can serve as units of measurement, needthere be any confusion? I don’t believe so really.A “unit of measurement” means one concrete, belonging under a concept, which istaken as the standard compared to which you then measure all the other concretesbelonging under that concept. If you take an inch as a unit of measurement oflength, an inch is a specified unit of length when regarded against otherlengths. But once you have selected the standard of measurement, thereafter youdetermine, you actually denote, the length of other objects in relation to thatobject whose length you have chosen to be one inch long.Prof. H: So in both senses “unit” is used as one of a group.AR: Yes, but this time it is chosen as a standard by which you measure.Prof. F: You just used the phrase “unit chosen as a standard.” I want to callyour attention to the sentence, on page 7, where I expected you to use thatphrase, but where you used the opposite: “Measurement is the identification of arelationship—a quantitative relationship established by means of a standard thatserves as a unit.” Why didn’t you say there “unit that serves as a standard”?AR: That’s purely verbal. I did not intend any different meaning. I think it wasbecause my emphasis here was on the fact that the standard chosen will be a unitof the measurement which has to be performed.016 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_016_r1.jpg]Prof. F: Your statement that all entities are measurable in terms of theirattributes raises this question in my mind: do you think all measurements in thelast analysis come down to things like measurements of length, velocity, and soon, in a reductionistic sort of way? For instance, you stated that colors can bemeasured in terms of wavelengths of light. And if we do that with allattributes, it seems to me that ultimately we will come down to a fewfundamental measurements—measurements, say, of velocity, of gravity perhaps,electromagnetic measurements—AR: You mean reductionism in the materialistic sense?Prof. F: No, I am not going that far at the moment. I am merely suggesting thatall material measurements may come down to a small list of measurements,ultimately.AR: But isn’t that a scientific question more than a philosophical one? Whethereverything in nature is ultimately reducible to subatomic particles and [whethermeasurement is reducible] to counting them—isn’t that a question for science todetermine? Philosophy cannot answer it one way or another. I would never attemptto say—because it would be completely arbitrary—whether all measurements areultimately relatable to only one set. That would be a scientific issue in regardto the nature of the universe. I would claim that all existents—since they arepart of one universe—are measurable. But I have never said that all standards ofmeasurement are ultimately translatable one into another or reducible one toanother. That would be a claim for which nobody has any evidence one way or theother.017 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_017_r1.jpg][In response to a question about Norman Campbell’s dichotomy of “intensivequalities” and “extensive qualities”—the two requiring, he claimed, differentsystems of measurement:]AR: I object in principle to the idea of making metaphysical distinctions of anykind on the basis of our ignorance. The fact that we can measure certainattributes but cannot be as precise in regard to others does not justify theidea of saying that entities possess two different categories of attributes,some of which are “extensive,” others “intensive.”Campbell’s standard here is not the nature of the entities but our capacity tomeasure—which means our state of knowledge, which is greater in one case than inanother. That is what I mean by taking our ignorance as a metaphysical standard.What would one say properly about the situation? Merely that some attributes areeasily related to one another quantitatively, and others, are harder to relate,and we have not yet learned how to measure them. I don’t see how that has anymetaphysical significance. By “metaphysical” I mean: in the nature of theseentities. Are we to say these entities have attributes essentially differentfrom one another—with the standard of difference being our ability to measurethem? I don’t think that is the proper methodology for establishing the natureof entities.EXACT MEASUREMENT AND CONTINUITYProf. D: Your definition of “measurement” involves a realist conception of therelationship of measurement to the world. And measurement involves not only somequantity but also a standard of measurement, a quantitative standard ofmeasurement, involving a unit that can be repeated over and over.AR: That’s right. But don’t leave out the rest of it. I said “some quantity, butmay exist in any quantity.” I specifically never said what kind of quantity,expressed in what mathematical figures, or achieved by what method.Prof. D: But what if we suppose that any numerical system is going to bediscrete in nature and rest upon discrete items?AR: It has to.Prof. D: Whereas suppose someone maintained that reality is continuous. Forinstance, Bergson wanted to maintain that. If Bergson is right, then there isthis gap between any numerical system and reality: reality is continuous,numerical systems are discontinuous, discrete. Then it would be the case that ina strict sense there wasn’t any exact measurement possible, because yourdiscrete units would never be able to handle this continuum. You would alwayshave those little infinitesimals left over.AR: Bergson wasn’t the first to argue that. Zeno did the same thing. Would youanswer for Bergson if you can, since he can’t be called upon: how did we get tothe moon? Without measurement?Prof. D: Oh, I am not denying the practicality of measurement.AR: How can it be practical if it doesn’t relate to or correspond to themetaphysical nature of reality? How can we achieve fantastic things in regard tothe material world and yet suppose for one minute that what we are doing isarbitrary and has no absolute, unquestionable relationship to the facts ofreality? Because the Bergsonian position amounts to denying the validity and theexistence of measurement. Now, are we going to argue on that point?Prof. D: Not on the practical value of measurement.AR: What is the distinction between the practical and the theoretical? That’s adistinction which I do not recognize. “Practical” means acting in this world, inreality. If what we do works, how is that possible if it doesn’t correspond toreality?Prof. D: Well, suppose the correspondence were just a gross one. For instance, Ican approximate, and my approximations are not terribly gross ones. I use aruler, and I say that this room is fifteen feet long and ten feet wide. And if Iorder lumber to build another room of this size, I will get approximately enoughlumber. So someone could maintain that the measurements are practical enough,even though metaphysically there isn’t a correspondence.AR: But I would not know, and I wish you would explain to me, what is meant by“metaphysically” in this kind of context. There are two different thingsinvolved here. If what we do is only approximate—which I do not grant, but let’sassume it is—that reflects merely on our capacity to perform exact measurements.How do we assign our incapacity to the metaphysical nature of reality? And morethan that, if you say that we cannot, with a simple ruler at home, measureinvisible submicroscopic lengths, will that invalidate the measurements which weare able to perform?And more than that, my main point is this. I would like somebody to explain tome, and I am not being just rhetorical, what is meant by “a continuous reality.”And in that context, what does Bergson think, if that is not a contradiction interms, about the process of measurement?—about the discrete vs. the continuous?I have made it clear—and this is really only common sense—that when you performa process of measurement you take a ruler and you decide this is the standardyou are going to use. Now, does it mean that, if you then proceed to measure amile by means of that ruler, there is some kind of “discontinuity” in the merefact that you have to move that ruler over and over and take your measurement ininstallments? It merely means that you cannot measure the whole mile at once.Now expand the same principle to interplanetary distances and it still applies.The fact that we isolate a unit is precisely the point I had in mind when Iwrote—let me quote this because it is retevant—“A unit is an existent regardedas a separate member of a group of two or more similar members. Two stones aretwo units; so are two square feet of ground if regarded as distinct parts of acontinuous stretch of ground.” The mere fact that we cannot encompass the wholeof the universe at a glance does not mean that, when we attempt to measure it orto establish relationships one step at a time, we somehow destroy the“continuity of existence.” You would not say that, if we measure this table inso many motions of moving the ruler, we have broken it up, whereas in reality itis a continuous table.Prof. D: No, but one could say that if reality, space, and so on, arecontinuous, then no discrete unit of measurement would ever be able to take carecompletely of measurement. Because no matter how small you made your unit, therecould still be a little bit left over or short. And if then you make even asmaller unit of measurement to take care of that little bit left over, stillthere would be a little left over or short. You could carry out the decimals asfar as you wanted to and there’d still be a discrepancy.AR: From the viewpoint of whom? Let me now go mystical, like Bergson, andsuppose we were a different size, the size of little beings inhabiting an atom(you know the metaphor that the atom is like a solar system). If we were thatsize, we could with the naked eye perform minute measurements which we cannot dowith our instruments now.Prof. D: It wouldn’t be exact though, if space is continuous.AR: Now, we have to define terms. What is the standard of exactness here? Whatis the standard of exactness that Bergson was discussing? That is the crux ofthe issue. We use the term “exact,” and now Bergson challenges it. What did hemean by “exact”? And what did he mean by “continuous”?Prof. D: He would mean by “exact” I think this: it would involve what existed inreality, and an exact measurement would be one which corresponded, without anymore or less, to what existed in reality.AR: Now, since it is an exact measurement, it presupposes a consciousness thatis doing this. Whose consciousness?Prof. D: Well, say mine.AR: All right. And if you are able to measure it, and you are able to grasprelationships by means of measurement which you didn’t invent, that isexactness. And if you are able to grasp that maybe some milli-milli-parts of amillimeter are not correct and you are not able to bring it to a greaterprecision, who grasped that? You did. Therefore, your concept is correct, doescorrespond to reality, and it is reality that you have been consulting indiscovering that perhaps you can’t measure submicroscopic quantities.Prof. F: So the very concept of “exactness” is a contextual concept. Suppose Isay to you that I will meet you in this room exactly one year from now. If whenyou arrive I take out a stopwatch and say you are a tenth of a second late, thisis dropping the context.AR: Exactly. Everything that we discuss, everything, is done from the humanviewpoint and has to be, because there is no such thing as “reality in itself.”That is one of the concepts of Kant’s that we have to be very careful of. If wewere omniscient like God, we would still have to perceive reality by ourGod-like means of perception, and we would have to speak of exactitude from thatviewpoint. But “things in themselves”—as separated from consciousness and yetdiscussed in terms of a consciousness—is an invalid equivocation. That would bemy widest metaphysical answer to any construct à la Kant and Bergson.Prof. D: So you answer this question by saying that contextually, for ourpurposes, the measurement will do. In saying that the sides of this righttriangle are each 1 foot long and the hypotenuse is 1.414 feet long, that willdo.AR: What is inexact about it?Prof. D: Well, geometrically it is inexact but it will do for building aplatform.AR: No, that is not what I am saying. I am saying that when we speak ofmeasurement, we begin with a perceptually given unit, and that unit is absoluteand exact [within the context of our means of perception]. Then conceptually wemay refine our methods and we may measure such things as milliseconds and a partof a subatomic particle, which we can’t do perceptually. But the standard ofthese measurements, the base from which conceptual complications may later bederived, is that which we perceive directly on the perceptual level; that iswhat measurement means, that is its base. Therefore, when I say that formeasurement there has to be a unit of measurement, I mean that even when youtake a submicroscopic, conceptual type of measurement, that type ultimately hasto be reduced back to our standard of measurement, which is the perceptuallygiven, and nothing more or less.With scientific development you might discover that, microscopically, the edgeof this piece of paper is ragged and has tiny mountain peaks and valleys. Thatis not relevant to your [macroscopic] process of measurement, because you had touse the perceptual method as a start in order to get to your microscopicinstruments of measurement.Prof. I: On the exactitude of measurement, is this chain of reasoning correct?We measure this book first, say, in inches. And we find that it is six incheslong, plus a little bit. Then we subdivide the unit “inch” into sixteen equalsubdivisions, measure it again, and find that it is six and threesixteenthsinches long. Then we fix up some fancy apparatus by which we can measure it bymeans of light waves, and we get accuracy to twenty decimal places. Then we ask,well, what is the relationship to the unit “inch” really? Well, it is what itis, but if we want to say that it is really six plus the square root of twoinches long, we are saying this independent of any possible measurement that wecan actually perform. As such, we are attempting to abstract consciousness awayfrom a concept of consciousness, and therefore it is invalid. In short, isn’t itmeaningless to ask, “What is the relationship to the inch really, out of contextof a given instance of measuring?”AR: Yes, in the sense of going beyond the point where more minute measurement ispossible. Because then you would say that under any circumstances there will besubsubquantities which you can’t measure by the same ruler. In that sense itwould be an improper switch of the term “measurement.” When you speak ofmeasurement, you always have to define contextually your method of measurement.So that if you say it is so much measured by a ruler, or it is something elsemeasured by some fancy apparatus, you have complied with the requirement ofabsolute correspondence to reality. You have said it measures so much by suchand such means.But to talk about what it would measure without any consciousness there tomeasure it, that would be improper.Prof. E: Every measurement is made within certain specifiable limits ofaccuracy. There is no such thing as infinity in precision, because you are usingsome measuring instrument which is calibrated with certain smallestsubdivisions. So therefore there is always a plus or minus, within the limits ofaccuracy of the instrument. And that’s inherent in the fact that everything thatexists has identity. Now if that’s so, you can measure up to any specifiabledegree of precision by an appropriately calibrated measuring rod.If exactness in measurement is defined in such a way that you have to get thelast decimal of an infinite series, by that definition no measurement can beexact. The concept of “exact measurement” as such becomes unknowable andmeaningless, and therefore what would it mean to say a measurement is inexact?Exactness has to be specified in a human context, involving certain limits ofaccuracy. Is that valid?AR: Yes, in a general way. But more than that, isn’t there a very simplesolution to the problem of accuracy? Which is this: let us say that you cannotgo into infinity, but in the finite you can always be absolutely precise simplyby saying, for instance: “Its length is no less than one millimeter and no morethan two millimeters.”Prof. E: And that’s perfectly exact.AR: It’s exact. If an issue of precision is involved, you can make it preciseeven in non-microscopic terms, even in terms of a plain ruler. You can defineyour length—that is, establish your measurement—with absolute precision.NUMBERSProf. J: What measurements are omitted in forming concepts of particularnumbers, for example, the concept of “seven”?AR: In a certain sense the measurements omitted from the concept of numbers arethe easiest to perceive. What you omit are the measurements of any existentswhich you count. The concept “number” pertains to a relationship of existentsviewed as units—that is, existents which have certain similarities and which youclassify as members of one group. So when you form the concept of a number, youform an abstraction which you implicitly declare to be applicable to anyexistents which you care to consider as units. It can be actual existents, or itcan be parts of an existent, as an inch is a part of a certain length. You canmeasure things by regarding certain attributes as broken up into units—oflength, for instance, or of weight. Or you can count entities. You can count tenoranges, ten bananas, ten automobiles, or ten men; the abstraction “ten” remainsthe same, denoting a certain number of entities viewed as members of a certaingroup according to certain similarities.Therefore, what is it that you retain? The relationship. What do you omit? Allthe measurements of whichever units you are denoting or counting by means of theconcept of any given number.Here the omission of measurements is perceived almost at its clearest. And Ieven give the example in the book—it’s an expression I have heard, I did notoriginate it—that an animal can perceive two oranges and two potatoes but cannotconceive of the concept “two.” And right there you can see what the mechanicsare: the abstraction retains the numerical relationship, but omits themeasurements of the particulars, of the kind of entities which you are counting.Prof. B: Does that mean that the referents of numerical concepts are not theentities as such, but entities regarded a certain way? In reality, each entityis one—that’s metaphysical. For you to have two, three, or four requires an actof consciousness to view them in a certain way?AR: That’s almost correct, except that you can’t say that in reality there’sonly one. As entities, each one is only one, but when you view them as seven,let’s say seven men, in reality there are seven men. This is the importantthing, otherwise it becomes subjective. In reality there are seven men. Why doyou identify them as seven men, and you don’t include in that four men, twopotatoes, and one street-car? In order to count them, you have to classify themas having something in common. It’s from that aspect that you can count them.Prof. B: The Greeks used to say that two is the first number, that one had akind of special status. Entities in reality, apart from consciousness, areindividual entities, and a group doesn’t have any higher metaphysical status.AR: None whatever.Prof. B: But it’s as if the numbers higher than one are tools of integration andnot direct designators of—I can’t say it without making a mistake!AR: That means you are on the wrong track. The number “two” is cruciallyimportant epistemologically, because to form concepts you need two or moreexistents between which you observe similarities. It’s in that sense that thenumber two is very important, epistemologically. Metaphysically, it is allequal—there is no metaphysical hierarchy between one and a million.Prof. B: The reason it comes up is that any object that you choose in realitycan be viewed objectively as two of one kind of units or four of another kind ofunits or whatever, depending on how you divide it up or how you view it. Forinstance, we can view this book as one entity, as two halves, as one hundredpages, etc.AR: That’s right.Prof. B: But isn’t there some special metaphysical status to the fact that it isone entity? To say that this is one is somehow a more metaphysical statement,and it is that distinction that I’m trying to pin down.AR: More metaphysical than what? Than saying that it is one hundred pages, orthat it is two halves of one book?Prof. B: But to say that this is one book and to say I have ... no, it remainsmetaphysically the same.AR: It remains the same. But you know where you might sense a distinction? It’sthat the term “one” is the concept “entity.” And the concept “entity” is thebase of your entire development. It has that great epistemological significance.018 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_018_r1.jpg]Prof. E: Is there a distinction in meaning or referent between the concept“unit” and the concept “one,” in the sense, for instance, that you grasp thatthis is one ashtray, or one book? To regard it as a unit is to regard it, as yousay, as a member of a class of similar things. Is that same perspective involvedin grasping that it is one?AR: Before you have a concept of numbers?Prof. E: Yes.AR: You will perceive that it is one, as an animal would, but you couldn’t graspthe concept “one” without a concept of more than one—without a concept ofnumbers.Prof. E: Perception gives you directly a certain kind of quantitativeinformation.AR: Yes.Prof. E: Even prior to either implicit or explicit concepts.AR: That’s right.Prof. E: And is it true that that quantitative information is presupposed,before you form even the implicit concept “unit”? In other words, a young childwould have to perceive that this is one, even though it has no implicit conceptof that, before it could even form the implicit concept “unit.”AR: Of course, and here is where we have to be Aristotelian : everything thatexists is one. “Entity” means “one.” But we couldn’t have the distinctionbetween what we mean by “one” vs. what we mean by “entity” if we didn’t have theconcept of numbers more than one which, after all, are only multiplied ones ordivided ones.Prof. E: So you get quantitative information by perception ; then, via theprocess of grasping similarities and differences, you form the implicit concept“unit.” You then rise to the general conceptual level, at which point you areable to form conceptually for the first time the concept of various numbers,including “one.”AR: Right.Prof. E: Am I correct in saying that “one” and “many,” as concepts, aremetaphysical, while “unit,” as a concept, is epistemological?AR: That’s right.Prof. E: Is it correct to say that “quantity” is a metaphysical concept and“measurement” an epistemological one, in the sense that if human beings andconsciousness were erased, there would still be quantities, but there would nolonger be such a thing as measurement. Measurement involves a human act ofestablishing relationships.AR: Of establishing quantity, that’s right.Prof. E: And is that why you formulate the nature of concept-formation in termsof omitting measurements rather than omitting quantities?AR: Right.Prof. E: Because you omit the relationships that you could establish?AR: Yes. But the quantities continue to exist whether you measure them or not.019 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_019_r1.jpg]Prof. H: This is related to the issue of forming number concepts. On page 9, yousay that the stage at which a child learns to count is when he is learning hisfirst words.AR: It comes a little later, as a matter of observation. It is almostsimultaneous but not quite. Before a child can be taught to count, he has tohave the beginnings or the rudiments of the vocabulary.Prof. H: You meant counting explicitly, as in counting how many people are inthis room, not just in the sense of perceiving the quantity.AR: No, literally to count, as a conscious activity. He perceives thequantities, but he has to first form some concepts identifying objects, and thenhe can begin to count the objects explicitly.Prof. H: You say that it occurs shortly afterward. From what I have observed, itseems to occur quite a bit later, so that it seems to be a much higher-levelprocess.AR: It isn’t so much higher-level, but the fact is that you cannot begin tocount objects until you have learned to distinguish them, and you cannotdistinguish them firmly until you have learned some words—i.e., formed someconcepts. Therefore, it is part of the same general development. But a childdoes have to acquire some conceptual vocabulary, meaning: learn to identify someconcretes in reality, before he can begin to count.Prof. H: I was taking it too literally.AR: No, if I said “when he is learning his first words,” I meant in the samegeneral period of development.MATHEMATICSProf. B: You have said [in a section here omitted] two things about themathematical field. One was that once the base has been established, one canproceed without direct reference to perceptual reality. The second point wasthat the mathematical field was more precise than the conceptual. Would both ofthose facts be due to the particular nature of mathematics—that it is a scienceof method?AR: In part. Also it is a science that defines the entities it deals with verysimply. For instance, all you have as the basis of your operation is thearithmetical series. You don’t need any further definitions as a base. From thenon you work with that base. Whereas in other conceptual knowledge you deal withsuch a complexity of phenomena that your definitions can change as yourknowledge expands, and your definitions may be very imprecise indeed. That’s oneof the differences.Prof. B: In other words, you have all of the material before you from thebeginning in mathematics. There’s no new information which you are going tointegrate into your concepts. Rather you are going to build up abstractions fromabstractions, such as “function,” “limit,” and so on.AR: That’s right. This is not to imply that non-mathematical conceptsnecessarily have to be in some way less exact than mathematical concepts. No.The ideal to aim at is to bring your concepts into exactly that kind ofprecision. At least those concepts you know—you cannot have omniscience, and youcannot guarantee that you will not expand your knowledge (as I explain inChapter 5) and change a concept’s defining characteristic.But the proper epistemological ideal is to have your conceptual knowledge, asfar as it extends,in as precise a form as mathematics. Or as mathematics used tobe, prior to Russell. When I say “mathematics,” I really don’t mean the modernstatus of the science, but proper mathematics, rational mathematics.Prof. B: In other words, it is not in the nature of the two fields that one mustbe more precise than the other. You are talking journalistically.AR: I am talking not journalistically, but empirically, of the difficulty of thejob involved. But this is one of the very vague suggestions of why I think thatmathematics has something to do with the essential pattern ofconcept-formation—that it serves as an ideal.But I don’t want to sound Platonic here. It is simply that the kind ofperfection which mathematics used to have (and applied mathematics still seemsto have) is the pattern for concept-formation and concept-use. That is the wayour conceptual equipment should be. But it’s much harder; more is involved.Prof. B: When you say it is the pattern, are you saying it is just anillustration or in some sense it serves that role? That’s not mathematics’function—you wouldn’t define mathematics in those terms if you ever worked thisout.AR: Oh no. It’s simply that mathematics, being a science that dealspredominantly with concepts, and clearly defined concepts whose definitions donot change, gives you the pattern of precision that you have to bring into yourconceptual equipment; which latter, dealing with a much more complex field ofknowledge, is much more prone to error or ignorance or change, change on thebasis of newly discovered and relevant knowledge. So that mathematics as ascience which deals with firmly defined entities can serve as a model.020 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_020_r1.jpg]Prof. C: Don’t the definitions of mathematical concepts change with the growthof our knowledge?AR: No. Philosophically, you may have much better definitions of mathematicalterms than they have today. But that’s merely due to the fact that there’s beenno real philosophy of mathematics to speak of. But the actual definitions do notchange.Prof. C: I don’t see why you say that. For example, in the case of “number,”first there were natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.), then fractions wereincluded under the concept “number,” because they were similar. Then theyinvented imaginary numbers and other numbers which have even a more dubiousstatus, like trans-finite numbers, etc. But in any case, the definition of theconcepts would change in this wider context.AR: Well, not of the concept “number,” for instance.Prof. C: Why?AR: Because look right in your presentation: first you have natural numbers. Andthen you have fractions. Well, that’s not the same concept, it’s a subdivision.It’s a new elaboration of what you know about the science of numbering. But theaddition of fractions, for instance, hasn’t altered in any way yourunderstanding of the basic number series. “One,” “two,” “three,” etc. remain thesame. But then you might have new combinations or new relationships numericallywhich you identify as fractions, and then powers or roots. But your knowledge of“number” hasn’t changed. [Just as forming subdivisions of “man”—such as “farmer”or “brother”—does not change the concept of “man” or its definition.] What youcan do with numbers, or what type of measurements you can discover, that’s adevelopment in your use of numbers, but not a change in the definition of“number” itself, in the way that the definition of “man” can change.Prof. B: Take “seven.” You don’t learn more information about “seven” whichleads you to change the definition of “seven.”Prof. E: You don’t discover new phenomena previously unencountered which requireyou to distinguish “number” in a new way, the way you do in the case of thechild’s expanding definitions of “man.”ABSTRACTION FROM ABSTRACTIONSFIRST-LEVEL CONCEPTSProf. F: I have a fundamental question about the hierarchy of concepts. On page22 you say, “The meaning of ‘furniture’ cannot be grasped unless one has firstgrasped the meaning of its constituent concepts; these are its link to reality.”Now, what about the meaning of “table”: can we say that the meaning of “table”cannot be grasped unless one has first grasped the meaning of “dining table,”“conference table,” “writing table,” and so forth? Are these its constituentconcepts? Or is the concept “table” a kind of privileged concept that comes at akind of absolute bottom in the hierarchy of concepts and has a directrelationship to reality?Or would you say that where a concept comes is determined by the context ofone’s own learning? For instance, might a person form the concept of “furniture”without having formed the concept of “table” before? Might he form the conceptof “living being” before he has formed the concept of “animal”?AR: In a sense, yes. There is a big problem here, however, whether this appliesall the way through the conceptual chain—which I would claim cannot be the case.But, on the level we are discussing, there is a certain element of the optional.Because when you first form your concepts, you might conceivably first form in avery loose way the concepts “living entity” versus “inanimate object,” and latersubdivide into “man,” “animals,” “plants,” etc. (and “tables,” “rocks,”“houses,” on the other hand). In a loose way, that can be done, but only up to acertain level. Because, suppose you started with the concept “living being.” Youwould then find that that is too generalized a category, and you would have tosay, in effect, “By living beings I mean men, animals, and plants.”Therefore, understanding what your original semi-concept “living being” meantwould depend on what you mean by the constituents, such as “man,” “animal,” and“plant.”What then is the ultimate determinant here? What I call the “first level” ofconcepts are existential concretes—that to which you can point as if it were anostensive definition and say: “I mean this.” Now, you can point to a table. Youcannot point to furniture. You have to say, “By furniture I mean ...” and youwould have to include all kinds of objects.Prof. F: Why wouldn’t one have an equal difficulty when one came, let’s say, tothe concept of “bird”? Why wouldn’t one have to say, “By bird, I mean eagles,penguins, and hummingbirds”?AR: Because, in fact, one doesn’t. And that is the difference betweensubcategories of concepts and first-level concepts. Because, you see, you couldnot arrive at the differences between eagles, hummingbirds, etc., unless you hadfirst separated birds from other animals.Even if chronologically you may learn those concepts in different orders,ultimately when you organize your concepts to determine which are basic-levelconcepts and which are derivatives (in both directions, wider integration ornarrower subdivision), the test will be: which objects you perceive directly inreality and can point to, and which you have to differentiate by means of otherconcepts.Prof. F: Then you are suggesting that metaphysically there are certain lowestspecies or infima species: certain concepts that are directly tied to concretes.Whereas, on top of them, we continually build higher-order concepts, whichrefer, in turn, to the lower.AR: Yes, if you mean, by “metaphysical,” existential objects—entities whichexist qua entities.Prof. E: I’d like to ask a follow-up question. This is the kind of question Iget all the time, which I do not fully know how to answer. I will give theexample: “table” is first-level, and then you can go up to “furniture” or downto “living-room table,” etc.AR: That’s right.Prof. E: Then I get this kind of question: Is it theoretically possible forsomeone to start by first conceptualizing living-room tables (he wouldn’t, ofcourse, be able to call it “living-room table” since he wouldn’t yet have theconcept “table”) and then “desk,” etc. and have separate concepts for all ofwhat we call subcategories of “table,” and then one day, in effect, grasp in anact of higher integration that they have something uniting them all, and reachthe concept “table”?AR: Theoretically, maybe; existentially, no. By which I mean that in order to dothat, if that is how a child starts, he would have to live in a furniture store.He would have to have observed an enormous number of certain kinds of tables sothat he isolates them first and then arrives at the overall category, which is“table.”Here, the process is directed by what is available to the child’s observationwhen he begins to form the concept.Prof. E: Would the state of his ability to discriminate also be relevant todefining what is a first-level concept? In other words, he couldn’t perhapsdiscriminate subtler distinctions before he had the gross category.AR: Exactly. And he has to have, and this is very essential, a sufficient numberof examples of a given category differentiated from other dissimilar entitiesbefore he can form a concept.Prof. E: What do you say about this objection? People say you can’t point totable, all you can point to is living-room table, or dining-room table, etc.,and, therefore, how do you distinguish “table” from “furniture” in this respect?AR: The answer is in the Conceptual Common Denominator. If you point to tableand you say, “I mean this,” what do you differentiate it from? From chairs,cabinets, beds, etc. You do not mean only a dining-room table but not an endtable. What is involved here, in the act of pointing, as in everything aboutconcepts, is: from what are you differentiating it?Prof. B: Isn’t the issue then what similarities and differences you are able tobe aware of? And wouldn’t that be a function of two things: the actualproperties of the objects plus the context that you are in?AR: That’s right.Prof. B: Take the earlier question of whether you could form the concept of“furniture” before the concept “table.” In order to do that, you would have toperceive the similarities uniting all items of furniture before you perceivedthe difference between a table and, say, a bed. And the question is: how couldthat ever come up?AR: The difficulty here is that the infant or child would have to have a muchwider range of perception than is normal to a beginning consciousness. He wouldhave to consider objects outside of the room, objects moving in the street, andthen conclude: by “furniture” I mean the objects in this room. Even subverbally,if this is what he observes, he has already made an enormously wide range ofobservations, which is not likely as a beginning. In logic, there would beobjections to that, because how would he differentiate furniture from, let’ssay, moving vehicles in the street? How did he get to that wide a range withoutfirst observing the immediate differences and similarities around him?Prof. B: If he looked at a bed and a dresser, let’s say, he would have to seethem as different before he saw them as similar.AR: That’s right. Also, remember that we use “table” as an example because thatis the object most likely to be one of the first perceived by a child in ourcivilization. But now suppose a child has to grasp the concept “coconut.” In ourcivilization that would be a much later development. He would probably firstgrasp “food,” then maybe “apple” and “pear,” until some day he discovers anunusual food—a coconut. But now take a child in a primitive society, in ajungle. He never heard of tables, and he might be bewildered when he first seesa table in the home of the local missionary. But “coconut” might be one of thefirst concepts he forms because coconuts are all around him.The overall rule for what is first-level is: those existential concretes whichare first available to your consciousness. But they have to be concretes. Afirst-level concept cannot be one which, in order to indicate what you mean byit, requires other concepts, as is the case with “furniture.” “Furniture” is nota term designating concretes directly. It is a term designating different kindsof concretes which all have to be conceptualized, as against another very broadcategory, such as moving vehicles, let us say.In other words, if, after you have acquired a conceptual vocabulary, a givenconcept cannot be understood by you or communicated by you without reference toother concepts, then it is a higher-level concept, even if maybe somehow yougrasped it first (and I question the issue of whether you could grasp it first).But the hierarchy that you will establish eventually when you are in the realmof a developed language, the hierarchy of which concept depends on the other,will not be determined by the accidental order in which you learned them,because that can have a great deal of the optional element and depends on whatis available in your immediate surroundings.It is after you are in the realm of language, when you can organize yourconcepts and say what you mean by “table,” what you mean by “furniture”—it is atthis level, logically and not chronologically, that you can determine which areconcepts of the first order and which are derivatives.021 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_021_r1.jpg]Prof. C: I have a follow-up on this same issue. You state, “Observe that theconcept ‘furniture’ is an abstraction one step further removed from perceptualreality ...” What I would like to get at is: what is that “one step”? It seemsto be the fact that to identify the units subsumed by “furniture,” you need tograsp the objects’ function, which is something that one does not perceivedirectly. The function is a more abstract characteristic.AR: May I point out something here? I said, in this sentence, an abstraction onestep further removed from perceptual reality. Now, remember, abstractions alsoare real. Abstraction itself is only our epistemological process, but that whichit refers to exists in reality; but it would not be available to us by directperceptual means. And, therefore, the term “perceptual reality” is veryimportant here. I don’t mean that higher abstractions are a step removed fromreality. I mean they cannot be perceived by perceptual means; in order to graspthem, we need concepts.A child can observe perceptually the function of an item of furniture. But itcannot be the first thing that he observes, because, before he can observe afunction, he has to isolate the objects of which this function is acharacteristic. In order to observe that a table is something on which you putobjects, a bed is something on which you lie down, he first has to conceptualizethose objects; then he conceptualizes what he can do with those objects—whattheir function is.Prof. C: But how does one focus on the function of a thing? Just looking at achair or a bed, for instance, doesn’t tell you what its function is. So how doesa child recognize the similarity in this case when there isn’t some perceivablecharacteristic like color that tells him that those things go together?AR: What do you mean here by the function? The use which you can make of it, inthe case of furniture. Well, you can observe that directly, after you haveconceptualized or isolated those objects. How does a child discover what a tableis for? Suppose he tries to lie down on the table and finds he is uncomfortable,but he lies down on the bed and he is comfortable. He observes that he is put onthe bed at night, but dishes are put on the table for dinner. That is observedperceptually. But to conceptualize it, he would first have to isolate and graspsuch a thing as table versus bed.The function itself is observable directly, but to conceptualize it he first hasto conceptualize the objects as objects. Because here the function is anaction-concept. It is either what the thing can do or what you can do with it.And an action-concept cannot precede an entity-concept. He first has toconceptualize the objects—the entities—then, the kinds of action they canperform or he can perform with them.Prof. C: So you don’t agree with my distinction that there are characteristicslike color and shape that are directly given in perception, as opposed to a setof other characteristics for which one must have a vaster amount of knowledge ordata?AR: I thought I agreed in a certain sense, if I understood you correctly. Ifyour question pertains to the order in which it is possible to form concepts,then I would agree with you that certain concepts, such as concepts of functionor action, even though perceptually observable, cannot be conceptualized withouta prior conceptualization of the acting or functioning entities. So, if you areasking, “Can concepts of function be formed ahead of the necessary antecedentconcepts?” I would say “no.” In that sense I agree with you. When you say thereis something extra that is required—the something extra is the conceptualizationof the entities involved, which is required before you can take the next step ofconceptualizing the functions.But we are referring here to the order of concept-formation. The fact thatfunctions can be observed perceptually is not the essential issue here. A childcan see a moving object directly, but he cannot form the concept “motion” untilhe has formed the concept “object.” Therefore, it is the order of possibleconceptualization that is different here. This is what makes concept-formationhierarchical. This is what forms the dependence of certain concepts on certainothers in human conceptual development.But as to which part of this conceptual hierarchy involves direct, perceptualobservation and which is purely conceptual—that is a somewhat differentquestion. On the lower levels of conceptualization—lower in the sense of firstto be conceptualized—all that first material is available to direct perceptionbut cannot be conceptualized indiscriminately, although certain optionalelements exist on the lower level.The higher concepts, the abstractions from abstractions, come when you have tointegrate perceptual concretes with concepts of consciousness or concepts ofhuman action. For instance, such a concept as “marriage” cannot be graspedperceptually. Even if you observed all the actions of a couple, that wouldn’tgive you the concept “marriage,” because here certain relationships, actions,and processes of consciousness are involved.So the distinction regarding the hierarchy in concept-formation is not what canor cannot be perceived perceptually, even though it is true that on the higherlevels the referents cannot be perceived by exclusively perceptual means. Theissue here is: which concepts can be formed first and which depend on otherconcepts that had to come before you reached that level. And the distinctionbetween an object and its function or action is one of those. You cannot graspthe function before you have conceptualized the object.022 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_022_r1.jpg]Prof. D: On the question about “furniture” versus “table” versus “coffee table,”I’m not clear as to the answer you gave to the question of whether or not it wascontextual.AR: My answer is that although there is an element of the optional for certainfirst-level concepts, the logical determination of which concept is primary, orfirst, and which is derivative depends on whether that second concept requiredthe conceptualization of the first, before it could be conceptualized.The hierarchy here refers to your concept-forming process —in other words, it’sa hierarchy of epistemology, not of metaphysics. Furniture exists on the samelevel as tables and chairs; But the question is, which concept depends on which?And the answer here is: that concept is second-level which, to be grasped,requires prior conceptualization of its constituents.So even if we suppose that some child grasped “furniture” before he grasped“tables” and “chairs” (which is highly unlikely), in organizing his conceptslater, he would have to place “furniture” second, and “tables” and “chairs”first. But he wouldn’t include “dining tables” and “coffee tables,” etc., asfirst-level, because those are subdivisions; he would have to form the concept“table” before he could subdivide it into particular classes of tables.Prof. E: Then is it true that while there is a certain area of option,chronologically speaking, as to which concept is formed first and which isformed by derivation, either by subdivision or as a wider integration, it isnevertheless true that once the conceptual apparatus has been developed and youestablish a logical hierarchy, that hierarchy is invariant for human beings,being dictated by the nature of the concepts, with no option as to which conceptis higher-level and which is lower-level?AR: Correct.Prof. E: Now to distinguish your view here from Aristotle’s. Aristotle wouldalso say that you could arrange concepts on a hierarchical level, in effect from“table” on up or “man” on up. But he would say that what qualifies as afirst-level concept is exclusively dictated by metaphysical considerations, andthat subtypes of “man” or subtypes of “table” have, in effect, a lessermetaphysical status.AR: Correct. We do not say that.Prof. E: Whereas, would it be correct to say that, for Objectivism, once we havethe logical hierarchy, the designation of concepts as first-level within thelogical hierarchy is dictated by a combination of metaphysical andepistemological considerations, and are in that sense objectively first-level,if I can use that terminology, as against intrinsically, in the Aristoteliansystem?AR: Exactly right.Prof. B: I don’t understand the difference between the chronological and thelogical order. In establishing the logical order, you consider whether thesecond concept requires the first one in order to be formed. But if it ispossible to form the concept of “furniture” before “table”—I don’t think that ispossible, but if it is—then why, in your logical hierarchy, would “furniture” bederivative?AR: Yes, but if chronologically you form “furniture” first, you would have onlya very approximate, very woozy lumping together of certain objects as againstsomething else, say moving objects. Therefore, your concept at that stage wouldbe enormously imprecise, and one could say almost tentative. Before it canbecome a fully clear concept in your mind, so that you know what you mean by“furniture” fully, you would have to know which objects you call furniture asagainst vehicles, architectural features, etc.Therefore, it is the precision of your concept, which you need in order tofirmly differentiate it from everything else in your context of knowledge, thatdetermines the hierarchical status of your concepts. So, you can form a vagueapproximation, but that is not yet a concept.Prof. D: Well, someone might say you can’t form the concept “flower” clearlyunless you know the specific kinds of flowers. I must say “flower” is a kind ofwoozy concept in my mind because I don’t know peonies from roses, etc.AR: No, that isn’t wooziness. The issue is: can you tell a flower from an animalor a man? You see, the clarity depends on whether you are able to differentiateand draw clear lines of demarcation, within the context of your knowledge,between one concept and another. If you can, that is conceptually valid. If not,then it is approximate or at a preconceptual stage.May I ask one general question? Is it of great importance what happens on thefirst levels of concept-formation? That is not important. The order in which wecan or cannot form concepts and which we can do first is really morepsychological than cognitive.Prof. E: I think it is a question of preserving the objectivity of the logicalhierarchy that is the crucial question.AR: But the logical hierarchy depends on which categories you regard asdepending on which. Do you know where it would have importance? Only in regardto issues such as the “stolen concept,” where somebody will claim that someconcept exists while denying the concepts on which it depends. But aside fromthat, I don’t think it is significant which concepts we form in what order,except that when we have reached the full conceptual level, when we can formsentences and can differentiate concepts consciously, when the process hasbecome self-conscious, then it is important to organize the relationships.Prof. F: I am very disturbed by this, because it seems to me that you either areor are not asserting that there are some concepts whose formation does notrequire lower-level concepts. I think this is a major position. You either areor are not saying that there are some concepts whose formation requires nolower-level concepts. Which is it?AR: All the things which you can perceive directly [and conceptualize] withoutpresupposing in that concept some other conceptual material, those are thefirst-level concepts. And if you want to form “animal” first and species lateror vice versa, that is optional. But you couldn’t have the concepts “love,”“truth,” “justice” as first-level concepts. You don’t perceive themperceptually, directly.Prof. F: So Objectivism holds that there are first-level concepts?AR: Epistemologically, not metaphysically.Regardless of what a given man did chronologically, once he has his fullconceptual development, a very important test of whether a concept isfirst-level would be whether, within the context of his own knowledge, he wouldbe able to hold or explain or communicate a certain concept without referring topreceding concepts. For instance, if a man formed the concept “furniture”directly from perception and then found that in communication he had to say,“Well by ‘furniture’ I mean tables, chairs, and other objects,” he’s classifiedit as second-level.Prof. B: But you can give a definition of “furniture” without referring to typesof furniture. Take the man who formed “furniture” directly from the perceptuallevel. If you ask him what he means by “furniture” he can answer: “movableman-made objects within a human habitation ...”AR: Oh, that he couldn’t do. That I can say with assurance. Because he couldn’tarrive at that kind of definition while bypassing the identification of theobjects he means. He could conceivably memorize that definition if he’s heardit, but he couldn’t form it himself. Because you’d have to ask him, “Well, whichobjects do you mean?”Prof. B: But then he’d just point to items of furniture without having to usethe classification—AR: While seeing no distinction between tables, beds, chairs, etc.? Seeing onlytheir distinction from architectural features or small objects, but nodistinction between them?Prof. B: He’d have to point to more than one. He couldn’t point to just thistable.AR: No, if he means “furniture” he’d have to point to several different items offurniture. And then the question arises, psychologically, is it possible to formthat kind of differentiation while never conceptualizing the particular things?The answer would be “no,” because he cannot point to those objects if he hasn’tconceptualized them.Prof. B: Can you say why that is? It has to do with similarities anddifferences, doesn’t it?AR: It has also to do with what is more immediately and easily available to hisconsciousness, when he’s starting to conceptualize, as against that which ismuch harder to identify and separate, and requires a wider context. To separatefurniture from architectural features is a much more complex issue ofobservations and requires a certain subtlety, which is why I say it is notlikely—if a man has that much subtlety, he would certainly not fail to observethe differences between tables and chairs.LOWER-LEVEL CONCEPTS AS UNITS IN RELATION TO HIGHER-LEVEL CONCEPTSProf. C: You say that one forms wider concepts by taking lower-level concepts asunits. I was somewhat perplexed; I would have liked to see a different phraseused, namely that the wider concepts are formed from the knowledge of the lowerconcepts. Because some people, in mathematics for example, take a certain levelof abstraction and quit referring to reality thereafter and deal with nothingbut the concepts.AR: That would be psychology, or psychopathology, and I couldn’t go into that.That some people would take language improperly—there’s no protection againstthat.Prof. C: But there’s another, more reasonable, objection. On occasion, in thedevelopment of science, or any particular area of learning, one makes incorrect,invalid conceptualizations, and it is later recognized that this is the case andone would reclassify the knowledge that one had based on this error. So my pointis, would it not be more precise to say that it’s the knowledge held by thelower-level concepts that is used?AR: No, it would not. It is not possible to summarize the preceding in making astatement. My statement has to be taken in the context of the material where itappears. And if I have explained that concepts represent a certain kind ofknowledge, derived by a certain method from reality, I do not repeat that everytime I use the word “concept.” Remember, when you are dealing with theirrational, there are no limits to it. Because then every time I use the word“knowledge,” I would have to answer the questions: “What is knowledge?” “What isreality?” “What do you mean by ‘What do you mean?’ ” And then you are in themiddle of logical positivism or linguistic analysis. It cannot be done that way.Prof. A: Is it even true that higher-level concepts could be defined that way?First-level concepts don’t stand for your knowledge of the existents, they standfor the existents themselves.AR: Right.Prof. A: Wouldn’t the higher-level concepts, too, stand not just for theknowledge contained in the lower-level concepts, but also for all the knowledgeever to be obtained about their units?AR: That’s right. That’s a very good addition; thank you for noticing it.Because every concept stands for present knowledge and future knowledge. That’sbrought out later in the book, but it’s a very important point. Because if aconcept stood only for your knowledge, the next time that somebody discoveredsomething new it would invalidate your entire conceptual chain.SUBDIVIDING BY NEW CHARACTERISTICSProf. B: I would like to ask about the CCD in subdivision. Suppose you aresubdividing “man” into “bachelor” and “married.” The essential characteristic ofman is rationality. But “bachelor” and “married” are ranges of measurements ofanother characteristic, not the essential one.AR: Yes, but you retain the essential characteristic, and then subdivide the twotypes of men according to the characteristic: relationship to the opposite sex—acharacteristic implicit in the basic concept “man” but which, in fact, is notessential to that concept.The concept “man” retains its full power, so to speak; it remains in effect, butthe characteristic according to which you now subdivide is the relationship tothe opposite sex.Prof. B: And that is the CCD for the subdivision?AR: Yes, because every member of the concept “man” would have some relationship,which would be either married or singie—or indifferent.CONCEPTUAL-LEVEL SIMILARITIESProf. C: I understand the point that a child’s first concepts are based onperceptual similarities, like similarities of color and of shape. But later,when he is dealing with more complex issues, the similarities seem to be moreabstract. At what point in his conceptual development does grasping similaritiesdepend on some mental operation beyond mere sense perception?AR: At the point where he has to deal with concepts that involve more than justperceptual knowledge. When he begins to deal with concepts of actions—and aboveall concepts of consciousness—at that point he can deal with them only by meansof abstractions from abstractions.For instance, if his mother tells him, “Don’t steal the cookies or you will be abad boy,” he cannot possibly understand that without grasping what is “bad.”There is no referent in perceptual reality to which he could point and say,“This is bad[ness].” He would have to say, “The action of stealing the cookiesis bad. But what does Mother mean by ‘bad’?” If he merely says, “Well, she willbeat me if I steal the cookies and will kiss me if I don’t”—his thinking isstill on the perceptual level. It’s when he grasps that some principle isinvolved here wider than the mere action of stealing the cookies and of rewardand punishment as direct perceptual consequences—it’s at that point that he’sentered the realm of abstraction from abstractions.Prof. E: Wouldn’t even “stealing” be an example of that?AR: Exactly.Prof. E: All you grasp perceptually is taking.AR: That’s right. Exactly. He is dealing with things which aredistinguishable—as “stealing” is a different concept from “taking”—but he can’tpoint to something in reality and say, “This is ownership, and therefore thesecookies belong to my mother and not to me.” There’s no perceptual evidence ofthat, because even if he observes that his mother made the cookies, that doesn’tgive him the concept of “property.”“Similarity” is not exclusively a perceptual concept; there is conceptualsimilarity. For example, suppose he has grasped the idea of stealing thecookies, and then he concludes, “If I take money from my mother’s purse, or if Itake the toys of the child next door, I’m stealing. Any time I take somethingwhich belongs to somebody else without their consent, that means the abstraction‘stealing.’ ” He has observed the similarities among all these actions. What’sthe similarity? Some object doesn’t belong to him, yet he appropriates it.That’s a very complex abstraction from abstractions, yet that is the similarityamong all the instances of that principle.Prof. C: But looking from the perspective of invalid concepts, when people claimthat they see similarities, how would I dispute their claim when the issue isnot perceptual?AR: Are you looking for a formulation of what it is that one does [in graspingconceptual similarities]?Prof. C: Yes, so that the criticism of subjectivity is not applicable.AR: Well, what would you do on the perceptual level? You simply point. If yousay that these two colors are similar, but that this color and that one aredifferent, you simply point. Well, you do the same thing on the conceptual levelby means of identifying what concepts you are dealing with.In other words, if you claim that Descartes and Kant are similar in theirmetaphysics, but some Kantian tells you, “No, they are entirely different,because Kant was really an apostle of reason and Descartes was not,” you wouldask him to define what he means by “reason,” and by “metaphysics,” then you givehim your definitions. Then you say, “I claim that they are similar in respectsA, B, and C, which are essential to the question under discussion: thesimilarities or differences of their metaphysics.”And if he answers you, “Yes, but Descartes was French and Kant was German,” youdismiss that as not relevant to the subject under discussion. Your definition ofthe concepts, your pointing out exactly what it is that you are discussing,substitutes for the perceptual evidence on the first level, where you merelypoint and say, “I mean this.”On the conceptual level, you define your terms, and if anyone disagrees and issubjectivist about it, you make him define his. And that may take a long time ina complex issue. But you will be able to prove your case, if you are taking theright position about what is similar and what is different. You will have tospecify what you are discussing and by what attributes or characteristics youestablish your claim that these are similar and those are different.Prof. C: I know that I see similarities not only at an elementary level butbetween theories and so on. But my question is: can you identify the mentalsteps that one takes in grasping, intuitively, more abstract similarities? Forthe perceptual level, I find the answer satisfactory that to look is to see, butI’d like to know the process for the more advanced stages.AR: The answer is the same: to look is to see—but what constitutes a “look” onthe conceptual level? Your grasp of the referents of the concepts you aredealing with. All that you need to do is to look—remembering what a look meanson the conceptual level: identify what you mean by your concepts not onlydefinitionally, but by reducing them to the facts of reality, to the perceptuallevel. Identify what kind of things your concept refers to in reality. And bydefining and concretizing that, you will see the differences and similarities aseasily as on the perceptual level.If you want to know why, with regard to abstractions from abstractions, you can“intuitively” know which are similar and which are different, that’s really apsycho-epistemological question. Your ability to see abstract similarities“intuitively” simply stems from the fact that you have automatized thatknowledge. For a human being’s purposes of dealing with an ever larger amount ofknowledge, a great deal of automatization is required. You would never get veryfar if you had to constantly and consciously retrace all the steps of how youformed each concept and then compare each concept from scratch with each newone.What is automatized is your understanding of what you mean by those concepts.And if you go very high in the conceptual chain, you may be unable to identifyinstantly why a certain high-level concept seems to you to have similaritieswith another. You will say, “I know it intuitively.”What do you mean by that? That the knowledge has been automatized in your mind.Then what’s needed, if you want to prove it to somebody who doesn’t see it, isto break down that automatization—that is, to identify exactly the definingcharacteristic, and even some of the lesser characteristics, if necessary, ofthe concept. You give an exact statement of what you are dealing with and whereyou see the similarity and the difference.Prof. E: If the question is: how do you objectively validate a claim tosimilarity? I would do it by following the definition of “similarity”: the samecharacteristic, varying in measurement or degree or intensity.Take the example of the primacy of consciousness in Descartes and Kant. Theyobviously are not identical in degree or intensity, because they vary inmeasurement. Take just the primacy of consciousness in those two: Descartes issemi-apologetic, and Kant is vehement about it. For Descartes, there are severalaspects of his philosophy exempt from it, and in Kant it’s all-embracing. Soit’s the same characteristic but differing in various measurements. You canestablish the similarity objectively simply by showing that the variations inthat characteristic are variations in measurement.But now there’s a second issue. Identifying and even validating the similaritydoes not yet establish that it is a fundamental similarity. For instance, bothDescartes and Kant had royal patrons. That’s not a fundamental similarity. Soyou’d have to use the test of fundamentality: how much of the rest of theirphilosophy does it explain? Now, clearly the primacy of consciousness explains agreat deal; the fact that they had royal patrons explains little or nothing.So you’d have two different tasks: (a) to establish the similarity by showingthe characteristic is the same and only the measurements vary; and, (b) if youclaim that it is a fundamental similarity, to show that a significant number ofthe rest of the subject-matter’s characteristics follows from this similarity.Would you agree with that?AR: Yes.Prof. B: I understood the question to be not how you validate similarity, butwhat is the pattern of the process of grasping it. If I had never thought aboutthe question of Kant and Descartes before, I’d define to myself what is therespect in which I’m asked to show they are similar. And the answer is:metaphysics. So I’d ask: what is the real fundamental in metaphysics? And theanswer to that would guide me in gradually abstracting from all the metaphysicalstatements in those two philosophers where they stand on that fundamental issue.In other words, I would use my knowledge of the fundamental characteristic inmetaphysics to guide me in abstracting their position on that fundamental. Andthen I would compare them directly.And in a good psycho-epistemology, that process is automated. The interestingquestion would be: “Why is it automated?” And isn’t the reason this: in a goodpsycho-epistemology you originally hold the issue in terms of fundamentals, andtherefore it’s stored away in a form—I don’t know how to say it—where the wirescross more easily?AR: That’s right. It’s a good metaphor.Prof. B: It’s your point that the conscious mind sets the purpose for thesubconscious. If you give yourself the question: “Are Descartes and Kantsimilar?” what your mind immediately feeds you depends on what you’ve stored andheld as the fundamentals of Descartes and Kant.AR: Right. That’s a very important observation, psycho-epistemologically. That’sone of the worst consequences of faulty definitions: you will be confused everytime you have to use these concepts, precisely in a case like this. If youhaven’t filed by the fundamentals of the issue, but by some accidentalcharacteristic, when you need to compare them you’ll be in real trouble.CONCEPTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS“THOUGHT” VS. “EMOTION”Prof. B: What is the CCD uniting thinking and emotion? The CCD would have to bea characteristic of both for which there is one unit of measurement applicableto thinking and emotion, and I don’t see that they have the same unit ofmeasurement.AR: I mentioned in Chapter 4 that the CCD for all concepts of consciousness is:action of consciousness. That is the common denominator.Prof. B: Is there a unit of measurement for that characteristic which holds forboth thinking and evaluation?AR: All measurements in regard to concepts of consciousness are onlyapproximations. With that in mind, the common denominator would be intensity—theintensity of a given mental state and its hierarchical importance to you,measured by the ordinal numbers. Therefore, you could compare thought to anemotion by the process which your consciousness performs in either, and by itsvalue or importance to you.Prof. B: I experience it introspectively, but I can’t name what is the commonprocess.AR: Do you mean that you are looking for a common unit of measurement for eachprocess of consciousness, like between thought and emotion, and between emotionsand memory?Prof. B: Yes.AR: What makes you assume that is necessary? Here you don’t differentiate eachseparately from the others. You keep the total context, which is: your mentalactions, the content of your consciousness. And then you isolate them from allthe others, not one from the other.Prof. B: I think that is the key, but what is puzzling me is a comparison that Iam making to the other abstractions. For instance, for “table” the CCD would bethe shape—AR: The shape of the table versus the shape of the chair, let’s say.Prof. B: And the point is that tables and chairs are both measured by the sameunit of measurement, that is, a unit of measurement of shape.AR: Right.Prof. B: Now, if we draw the parallel, the CCD for thinking and for emotionwould be conscious action, both measured by the same unit—the unit of consciousaction—only I can’t find any.AR: Here you don’t need a unit; you need first the demarcation of the field. Allof the concepts of consciousness have one thing in common: that it is a processor an action of consciousness and it is internal, it is your psychologicalprocess versus the outside world. Therefore, you have already separated all ofthese particular phenomena which you want to conceptualize, and have separatedthem in a radical way from existential concepts.In existential concepts you don’t start by saying, “Well, all of this isexistential, now what is the difference between tables and chairs?” Because youdon’t even have the distinction yet of existential versus psychological. As toconcepts of consciousness, however, since consciousness consists of processesand their content, you cannot become aware of it until it has some kind ofcontent. But there the range of what you have to conceptualize is infinitelysmaller than in concepts of existential objects. You have already classifiedthem: they concern that which takes place in your mind, as distinguished fromthe objects which your mind observes. That is your first line of demarcation.Thereafter, all your concepts of consciousness have as their Conceptual CommonDenominator that it is a state of consciousness.But now how do we find a measuring unit for a state of consciousness—is thatreally relevant? Once you have identified different processes—you say, “I knowwhat my mind does when I think, when I feel, when I remember”—isn’t thatsufficient for conceptualizing purposes? Since the overall category is alreadyvery clearly defined and delimited.Prof. B: But what enables me to differentiate thinking from emotion is thatintrospectively they are different perceptually, directly.AR: No, that they are different actions. Now, would this help you? I mentionedthat what they have in common is the object.Prof. B: Right.AR: For instance, what you think about a given event and what you feel about itare two different things. In what way are they different? The event is the same,but you observe that your mind does something different. Your consciousness isin a different state according to whether you think about this event or havefeelings about it. Well, that is sufficient differentiation.Prof. B: Just as in the case of conceptualizing colors.AR: Yes.[The reference is to the statement on page 15: “Centuries passed before sciencediscovered the unit by which colors could actually be measured: the wavelengthsof light—a discovery that supported, in terms of mathematical proof, thedifferentiations that men were and are making in terms of visual similarities.”The point seems to be that just as we didn’t need to find a unit of color inorder to distinguish blue from red, so we don’t need to find a unit of consciousaction in order to distinguish thinking from feeling.]INTENTIONSProf. D: According to your statement on page 29, every act of consciousness hasa content. But this relationship seems to be of a special kind. For instance, ifI truly say, “I intend to go home,” it would seem to be absurd to say, “Well,maybe you’re wrong, you are not intending that at all.” It would seem, in short,as if there were a necessary connection between the action and the content.AR: Will you tell me in your example which you classify as the content and whichis the action of consciousness?Prof. D: This is, perhaps, more a part of the question I am asking you. I say,“I intend to go home.” According to your analysis, there would be an action ofconsciousness and an object or a content connected with it.AR: That’s right. The action of consciousness is a consideration and aconclusion drawn. You have considered the subject of your going home and youhave decided that you will. The expression of that is, “I intend to go home”—meaning that you have given consideration and reached a certain intention orconclusion. That is the action of your consciousness.Now, what is the content of that action? The question of the trip home. Thesubject here is the issue of going home or not, the contemplating of a certainjourney. The action is the consideration of that subject and a certainconclusion reached, which you then announce as, “I intend to go home.” Those arethe two elements. What is missing?Prof. D: Suppose I say, in a dark room, “I am hitting a dog.” But then I turn onthe light and it turns out I was hitting a pillow. Here there is a contingentrelationship between the action and the object.Prof. E: I think he is trying to suggest that in connection with at leastcertain actions of consciousness you have a kind of infallibility about them—youcan’t be mistaken in your view of what they consist of—whereas in physicalactions you can be mistaken about the object.AR: I would say, quite as an aside, that the exact opposite is true.Prof. E: I don’t think that is an aside, I think that is the point.Prof. D: Based upon this notion that I couldn’t be mistaken, one would want tosay there is some kind of necessary connection between the action and the objectof the action. There would be some kind of absurdity in someone saying, “Youmust be mistaken, you don’t really intend that.”AR: Now we are talking about the action of your consciousness, aren’t we? Notabout whether you really will go home or not.Prof. D: Yes.AR: If it were true [that men couldn’t be mistaken about the actions of theirconsciousness in this way], we would be living in Atlantis. If men identifiedintrospectively their inner states one tenth as correctly as they identifyobjective reality, we would be a race of ideal giants. I ascribe ninety-fivepercent or more of all psychological trouble and personal tragedies to the factthat in the realm of introspection we are on the level where savages were (orlower) in regard to extrospection. Men are not only not taught to introspect,they are actively discouraged from engaging in introspection, and yet theirlives depend on it. Without that, nothing is possible to them, including[proper] concept-formation.Prof. D: How do you mean that they are mistaken? Are most people mistaken whenthey say they are thinking of going home?AR: Make it a little more complicated than that and I would say most people donot even report their inner states correctly—and I don’t mean now anything likelying; it is an issue of personal identification, or lying to yourself. Theycould tell you, “I hate my mother-in-law,” when in fact they are secretly inlove with her (I don’t mean in the Freudian sense). It is possible, because ofthe human capacity for evasions, repressions, and above all, rationalizationsand other defense-mechanisms. This is a field of which we are merely glimpsingthe first stages, and yet look at the enormity of the disasters possible to manin that realm.THE BASE OF INTROSPECTIVE CONCEPTSProf. E: In the case of extrospective knowledge, we are fallible, we can makeerrors. But we know that we can, in principle, arrive at the correct answer toany question given two facts: the use of a rational method combined with certainincontestable data on which we base all of our reasoning—namely, the directevidence of the senses, about which we can’t be wrong, as apart from errors inconceptualizing it or reasoning about it.AR: Right.Prof. E: The question is: insofar as we are to arrive at knowledge of thecontent of consciousness, what is the stand-in for the evidence of thesenses—the incontestable, infallible data which are the foundation for allsubsequent inference?AR: That’s an interesting question. I would say the foundation there is the sameas in extrospective knowledge. In other words, the base is that which you canconceptualize directly and which corresponds to that same level of conceptualdevelopment in the extrospective world. Everything else has to be built on that.Prof. D: That would be something like, “I am thinking.”AR: Oh no. First it would be your understanding of your mental state when yousay “table,” “chair,” “dog,” “cat,” etc. It’s your understanding of thedifference between consciousness and existence, and of knowing: here are simpleconcepts I can perceive, and I know what my mind is doing when I identify “Thisis a table,” “This is a chair.” That’s the base.Above that base, a more complex level would be: “And what is it to me?” It’swhen you enter the evaluative realm that you are in the greatest complexity. Andthe base there, the equivalent of the first-level concepts in extrospection,would be any simple evaluation which you can identify with certainty. If you cansay, “By ‘love’ I mean what I feel for my mother”—or simpler: for ice cream—andyou know that that’s what you mean by “love,” that’s your base for theevaluative realm.[In sum, the base is] your conceptualization of the simplest, first-level[extrospective] concepts available to you, and your first conceptualizations ofyour values, in the simplest terms. That is the base of your introspectiveconceptual hierarchy. If we can be mistaken about introspection as much as aboutextrospection—perhaps more—to what do we refer when we have to correct an errorof introspection? Well, we would refer to those simplest beginnings of aconsciousness, that which we can conceptualize in most direct terms.For instance, it might be terribly difficult to know what you feel about yourmother-in-law, let’s say (she’s supposed to be the object always of mixedfeelings), so it might be hard to decide fully what you really feel about thisperson. It would be a little easier if you then ask, “Well, how do I reallyevaluate that person?” Then you might find that you don’t really know. If youwant to check, you bring your mental attention, your chain, down to determiningwhat kind of inner states you know for sure, in the simplest terms. And fromthat, try to rebuild, step by step, your evaluation of this particular, complexproblem.DEFINITIONSESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS AS FUNDAMENTALSProf. C: On page 45, you state, “Metaphysically, a fundamental characteristic isthat distinctive characteristic which makes the greatest number of otherspossible; epistemologically, it is the one that explains the greatest number ofothers.” Could you explain how that applies to the sequence through which achild progresses in his definition of “man”? For instance, in the child’s firstdefinition: “a thing that moves and makes sounds,” I don’t see how the essentialcharacteristic there is also a fundamental one. I don’t see that the definitionexplains much about man. It merely distinguishes him from other things that thechild sees.AR: But first of all, are you clear on why I put this statement in this form—whythe distinction between “metaphysical” and “epistemological”? I’d like to pauseon that for a moment.“Metaphysically” here refers to that characteristic which, in the nature of thething, makes other characteristics possible. “Epistemologically” means the waywe would proceed to discover a causal explanation. You see, I could not put thesecond into a metaphysical category, because nature as such doesn’t explain. Athing just is, and certain characteristics are the causes of othercharacteristics. But metaphysically—that is, apart from human observation orknowledge—it doesn’t constitute an explanation, it’s just a fact.Epistemologically, the process of determining a defining characteristic willproceed by means of the question: which characteristic explains the others?Metaphysically, this means: which characteristic makes the others possible?Which is the cause?Now, let’s apply it to a child’s development. There the question doesn’t yetenter, because he doesn’t have to select a fundamental characteristic from amonga great many different observed characteristics. On that level of development,he has observed only two characteristics distinguishing man from inanimateobjects: these objects are motionless and silent, man moves and makes noises.Here he doesn’t yet choose a fundamental from among many characteristics whichdistinguish man from inanimate objects, because he doesn’t have that knowledge.The only distinctions he can observe are the defining characteristics. They areessential by default, in effect—because he can’t observe everything at once.It’s only with the development of his knowledge, when he observes more thingsthan merely movement and noise, when he observes that inanimate objects likeautomobiles also move and make noises—it’s when he has to make a choice amongman’s distinctive characteristics and he has to decide which one is essentialthat this process begins. Then choosing the fundamental is a necessity. But onthe first steps, to discover even one characteristic that distinguishes onegroup of existents from others is sufficient.THE EXPANSION OF A DEFINITIONProf. C: You state that: “All definitions are contextual, and a primitivedefinition does not contradict a more advanced one: the latter merely expandsthe former.” Now I don’t understand why you say that the latter expands theformer, as opposed to “narrows it down.” Take, for example, your sequence ofimplicit definitions, for a child, of the concept “man.” The first definitionis: “a thing that moves and makes sounds.” Now I agree that to form the nextdefinition his knowledge has to expand, but it seems to me that the definitionitself narrows, in that it no longer includes all the concretes which move andmake sounds.AR: But you are making an equivocation here. Bear in mind that all definitionsare contextual and that the purpose of a definition is to distinguish a givengroup of existents from all others. Now, if a child forms the implicitdefinition of “man” as “something that moves and makes sounds,” this means thatall he has so far observed are motionless, inanimate objects and men. And thisis only his first differentiation. He, in effect, says: there are things that donot move and are silent and then there are things which move and make noises.And by the things which move and make noises, he means men.Well now, he doesn’t contract his definition of “man” when he later changes itto: “a thing that walks on two legs and has no fur.” He has now expanded it,because he has observed more distinguishing characteristics of men, whichdistinguish man from a wider field of knowledge. You see, by the time he needsto define “man” in a more specific way, he knows that the definition “moves andmakes noises” includes much more than man, and therefore as a definition of manit is no longer valid. Therefore it is not a contracted definition, it’sexpanded in the sense of his having observed more characteristics of man.Prof. C: I see where I was making an error. I was thinking, in line with modernphilosophy, that a concept is equal to its definition, and assuming that all theconcretes that fit the formula “moves and makes noises”—even the new ones thathe later discovers—were therefore part of his original concept of “man.” Andthat’s wrong.AR: Yes. That’s precisely why the definition now has to be expanded.Prof. A: Isn’t it also true that, since the later definition is morefundamental, it’s expanded in the sense that it contains or implies the earlierdefining characteristics?AR: Plus others, yes.Prof. A: So a rational animal is also something that moves and makes noises.AR: Exactly. Each later definition subsumes the earlier ones.Prof. A: The definition has expanded in the sense that whatever knowledge iscontained in “moves and makes noises” is also contained in “a rational animal,”and more as well. Because a rational animal is also an animal that moves andmakes noises.Prof. E: The issue is only which characteristics are explicit in the definitionversus which are implicit.Prof. H: It is easy to assume that when the definition changes, the conceptchanges.AR: No, the context of your knowledge changes. When you know more, you select adifferent essential characteristic by which to define the object, because younow have to differentiate it more precisely. Your knowledge has expanded, butthe concept doesn’t change.The similarities and differences according to which you originally formed theconcept still remain. So you haven’t changed your concept. Your old distinctionremains the same; the concept refers to the same entity. Only now you know more,your field of knowledge is wider, and therefore you have to define your conceptby a different essential characteristic.Prof. H: I was falling into the old trap of thinking that the concept refers tothe—AR: To the definition only.Prof. B: Or only to the similarities and differences known at a given time.AR: Yes. But if you keep in mind that your concept refers to referents, tothings, you will see that it doesn’t change, but your knowledge changes.PHILOSOPHICAL VS. SPECIALIZED DEFINITIONSProf. B: This question pertains to the discussion of definitions on page 44. Yousay that the ultimate definition of man is “a rational animal.” I take it thenthat it would be wrong to define man as “a rational primate.”AR: Oh yes.Prof. B: Is that because man’s distinctive form of consciousness makes him abasic subdivision of “animal” rather than just a minor subcategory? In a sense,all other animals are limited to sensory forms of consciousness, but man isrational. That means you can make a basic subdivision of “animal” into “man” and“non-man” on the grounds of whether the consciousness is rational or justperceptual.AR: Yes, but what would be the purpose of this? Here you have an evaluativeconsideration entering. Is the distinction by type of consciousness moreimportant then, let’s say, the distinction between animal and bird, by feathersand ability to fly? You see, it wouldn’t necessarily be important formally, asyou formed the concept, whether the characteristic by which you subdivide is ofa tremendous, momentous kind or merely the only one you can observe that is atall significant. After you have formed the concept, it is a separateintellectual pursuit to find out whether that distinction is really enormouslyimportant, which [in the case of man versus animals] it is. But that fact is notof significance to the subdivision, to the classification of man as a rationalanimal.Prof. E: I was wondering whether you would agree with the following, which is myunderstanding of why the genus of man for a general definition would remain“animal.”Definitions and conceptualization always have to take into account the cognitivecontext. The normal adult does not deal with subdivisions like “primate.” And,therefore, for a general literate adult, “rational animal” would be appropriate,even if for a more specialized degree of knowledge you need the furthersubdivision.I can give this parallel: suppose a normal adult were defining “amnesia.” Ithink a valid definition would have as its genus something like “mental illness”or “mental disorder” (with the differentia indicating loss of memory). Whereasthe psychiatrist, who subclassifies mental ailments, could say its genus wassomething narrower, I think they call it a “dissociative reaction” or somethingof the sort. But that would not affect the validity of the genus “mentaldisorder” for a generally educated adult.AR: Yes, that is correct. I would add one thing of a more general nature.Philosophical problems have to be solved on a level of knowledge available to anormal adult at any period of human development; so that philosophical conceptsare really not dependent on the development of individual sciences. And“primate” or “mammal” would be a very specialized subdivision of a conceptaccording to a particular science.Prof. A: Then would it be wrong for a biologist to define man as “a rationalprimate,” or would that be correct in his context?AR: It would be correct in his context, if he remembers that he is speaking herefrom a professional context. And, as you know, they subdivide even further. Anysubdivision within a given science is proper provided it is not substituted forthe basic philosophical definition which is valid for all men in all stages ofknowledge.MEANING AND REFERENTProf. B: Someone once raised the following objection to the idea that themeaning of a concept is its referents. Take the concept “glass,” meaningdrinking glasses. Suppose one person has seen millions of glasses in his life,but only those of one particular type. A second person has seen only a few dozenglasses, but of a wide variety of different types. The question is: who wouldknow more of the meaning of the concept “glass”? Even though the first man hasseen many more referents of the concept “glass,” it seems that the second man,who has seen fewer of the referents, knows more of the meaning.AR: When you ask, “Who knows better the meaning of the concept?”—the answer is:both equally, because the concept doesn’t include the non-essential variations.To have the concept “glass” means you can differentiate a glass from all otherobjects. Therefore their knowledge is exactly the same.Prof. B: But the meaning isn’t just the essential characteristic.AR: The essential characteristic and lesser characteristics also. But now if oneman has observed more characteristics than another, he knows more about thereferents of the concept, which doesn’t mean that he understands the meaning ofthe concept better.Prof. B: The meaning of the concept is the entities which it integrates, and youknow the meaning when you know which entities it integrates.AR: That’s right.Prof. B: So if they both have the same standards for integration, they both knowthe meaning equally.AR: Exactly.Prof. B: So, the meaning is the referents; the form in which we hold ourknowledge of the meaning is the essential characteristics.AR: That’s right. But the important distinction here is understanding themeaning of a concept versus knowing more about its referents. A simpler exampleof the same kind would be: who knows more about the concept “man,” a layman or adoctor? Well, they both understand the concept equally, but the doctor may knowmore about the referents of the concept “man”—namely, about his physiology. Or apsychologist will know more about the type of consciousness of the referent.Prof. B: So “knowing more about the meaning” is equivocal. It could mean knowingmore about the objects or knowing more about what makes those objects glasses.AR: Exactly. About what differentiates those objects from all others.Prof. A: Now I’m totally confused. Because I thought the meaning is thereferent.AR: The meaning is the referent, but your understanding of the meaning of aconcept and your knowledge about the referent aren’t the same thing.Prof. A: By “understanding the meaning of the concept” you mean understandingwhat a concept means?AR: Yes, understanding which existents it refers to in reality. So that if youcan distinguish the referents from all other existents in your knowledge, youhave fully understood the meaning of the concept. But then if you study variousaspects of these referents, you may come to know more about them than someoneelse, but that is an issue irrelevant to understanding the meaning of theconcept.Prof. A: Then would it be correct to describe the person who goes into moreintensive study as learning more about—AR: About the referents. Not about the meaning of the concept. That’s theimportant thing. He knows more about the units, but not about the concept.Understanding the meaning of a concept is an epistemological issue. It isunderstanding to what in reality that concept refers. It’s being able todistinguish the referents from all other existents. That’s understanding themeaning of a concept. How much you know about the referents is something thatvaries from man to man. But the understanding of the concept is the same onceyou can distinguish the referents from all other things.In that sense the understanding of the concept “man” was the same a hundredyears ago as it is today, or is the same today for a savage and a scientist.They both understand the concept, but one knows more about the referents thandoes the other.And, incidentally, the concept subsumes all the characteristics of thereferents, known or yet to be discovered. And in that sense, what we knowtoday—if we took the total sum of knowledge about a given concept, like“man”—would still apply a hundred years from now, when, let’s assume, men willknow much more. But they won’t know more about the concept, they will know moreabout the referent of the concept.Prof. A: So in the argument against the analytic-synthetic dichotomy, when yousay that newly discovered characteristics are included in the concept’s meaning,you mean they belong to the same units.AR: Yes. But it doesn’t change the concept.Prof. A: Some philosophers raise this objection: how could you mean by a conceptmore than you know at a given time? So the answer is: well, you don’t know everyaspect of the referents, but you do know fully which referents you are talkingabout.AR: And you know what you do know about these referents and by whatcharacteristic you distinguish them from other referents, which is all thatconcerns you in regard to concept-formation.Prof. B: You do know fully now what you mean.AR: Exactly.Prof. A: The concept is fully meaningful if you can isolate validly a group ofreferents—AR: From all other referents, yes.DEFINITION BY NON-ESSENTIALSProf. K: In Chapter 7 you discuss the error of “definition by non-essentials,”and you distinguish between the cognitive and the epistemological results ofthat error. Would you explain how these two categories are differentiated?AR: The distinction is between the content of knowledge and the method ofacquiring it. It’s really explained right in the text. I say, “Cognitively, suchan attempt would produce nothing but a bad hash of equivocations, shoddymetaphors, and unacknowledged ‘stolen’ concepts.” Now that refers to the contentof your knowledge. Then I say, “Epistemologically, it would produce the atrophyof the capacity to discriminate”—which is an issue of the method of functioningof your consciousness.Therefore, cognitively, a definition by non-essentials will wreck the content ofyour knowledge; and, epistemologically, it will incapacitate or greatly hamperyour capacity, because it will be impossible to proceed with that kind of errorin your method. All extension of knowledge is contextual: you build newknowledge on the basis of the old. And if you have undefined terms, patches ofvagueness, or invalid concepts, it will affect all your subsequent cognitivesteps. It hampers and ultimately destroys the method of acquiring knowledge.CONTEXTUAL RECLASSIFICATIONProf. E: This question is a request for an example. On page 66 you say, “Thedefinitions of concepts may change with the changes in the designation ofessential characteristics, and conceptual reclassifications may occur with thegrowth of knowledge.” Could you give an example of a conceptualreclassification?AR: That really refers to derivative concepts. For instance, in a primitivestate of knowledge of medicine they subdivided “man” according to certaincharacteristics which were predominantly invented, and then with the growth ofknowledge they reclassified—you know, like “the choleric”—Prof. E: The four humors—“the melancholy”—AR:—etc. Well, that proved to be invalid, and therefore the classification is nolonger used.Prof. A: Would another example of that be the whale, which was originallythought of as a fish but is now, in a wider context of knowledge, classified asa mammal?AR: That would be an example of reclassification, yes.AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS“EXISTENCE” AND “IDENTITY”Prof. B: I’m interested in the fact that “existence” and “identity” have thesame units, yet they are different concepts. In general, would it be true thatif two different concepts have the same units, then what makes them two conceptsrather than one is that in each case the units are differentiated from somethingelse? For instance, in the case of “concrete” versus “entity,” the units are thesame, but the concept “entity” distinguishes entities from attributes, while theconcept “concrete” distinguishes entities from abstractions.AR: That’s correct.Prof. B: Then is it the case that what distinguishes the concepts “existence”and “identity” is that the concept “existence” differentiates this object fromnothing, while “identity” distinguishes this from that?AR: You could put it that way. The distinction between these two is really anissue of perspective. “Existence” is the wider concept, because even at aninfant’s stage of sensory chaos, he can grasp that something exists. When hegets the concept “identity,” it is a further step—a clearer, more specificperspective on the concept “existence.” He grasps that if it exists, it issomething. Therefore, the referents of the concept “identity” are specificconcretes or specific existents. And, you see, even though it is the sameconcept, the whole disaster of philosophy is that philosophers try to separatethe two.“EXISTENCE” VS. “EXISTENT”Prof. B: What is the relationship between the concepts “existence” and“existent”? Is it that the concept “existent” is a term which applies a conceptto a particular or designates the particular as a unit under the concept?AR: That’s right. Because the concept “existence,” at least the way I use it, isin a certain way close to the concept “universe”—all that which exists.Prof. B: “Existence” is a collective noun almost.AR: That’s right. An existent is, then, a particular which exists.“FACT”Prof. B: What is the difference between the concepts “fact” and “existent,” andis “fact” an axiomatic concept?AR: No. “Fact” is merely an epistemological convenience. The term “fact” canapply to a particular existent, to an aspect, to an attribute, or to an event.An existent is a concrete. “Existent” is a very convenient term in that itsubsumes entities and attributes and actions and even mental events. They exist.Prof. B: Relationships too?AR: Yes—everything that exists on which you can focus, anything which you canisolate, whether it is an entity, a relationship, an action, or an attribute.The concept “existent” refers to something which exists. And it is wider thanthe concept “entity,” because it permits you to subsume under that concept, andfocus on, attributes or relationships or actions—on that which depends on anentity but can be studied separately.Now, “fact” is merely a way of saying, “This is something which exists inreality”—as distinguished from imagination or misconception or error. So youcould say, “That the American Revolution took place is a fact,” or, “That GeorgeWashington existed is a fact.” In the first case you refer to an enormouslycomplex series of events over a period of years. In the second case you refer tojust one individual. Both are facts.Prof. E: You wouldn’t say, for instance, that the American Revolution is or wasan existent?AR: No.Prof. E: Or a war wouldn’t be an existent?AR: You could treat it as that, but in speaking of it you wouldn’t talk thatway. Why? Because “existent” primarily refers to a metaphysical status [such asentity, attribute, etc.].Prof. E: And a war or revolution would be an enormous complex of entities,relations, and actions.AR: Of all sorts of existents.Prof. E: So that when you have that complexity, it is easier to say “fact.”AR: It is easier, and there is a certain subtle distinction.Prof. E: The term “existent” more implies a particular entity or attribute orrelation, and “fact” a whole conglomeration of them?AR: “Fact” can subsume both. It can be a particular narrow detail, or an entity,or an event, or a series of events.Prof. E: Would you say that either of those concepts is wider than the other, orthat they don’t differ in their extension but simply in their perspective?AR: In the perspective.Prof. B: Is “fact” a concept like “necessity” in the following respect? Thereferent of “necessity” is the same in a sense as the referent of “identity”;but “necessity” is a concept which comes much later in the hierarchy and derivesfrom our particular form of consciousness [i.e., from its volitional nature—see“The Metaphysical Versus the ManMade,” in Philosophy: Who Needs It]. It is aconcept we need to distinguish things outside our control from things in ourcontrol.AR: Correct.Prof. B: Is “fact” like “necessity” then—in that we need the concept “fact” fortwo reasons, both deriving from the nature of our form of consciousness? Numberone is that our form of consciousness, like any, is limited and, therefore, weget information bit by bit, so to speak, and “fact” designates the bit ofinformation or of reality that we have gotten. Or is it that “fact” is a conceptwhich we need because we are capable of error?AR: It is the second.Prof. E: Which would not be true of the concept “existent.” AR: No.Prof. B: So “fact” then designates existents, but it is used in a context inwhich it is relevant to distinguish knowledge from error.AR: That’s right.Prof. B: It’s not that the fact refers to the knowledge; it refers to thereality known, or possibly known.AR: That is correct. It is a concept necessitated by our form ofconsciousness—that is, by the fact that we are not infallible. An error ispossible, or a lie is possible, or imagination is possible. And, therefore, whenwe say something is a fact, we distinguish primarily from error, lie, or anyaberration of consciousness.And it serves another function: it delimits the concept “existence” or“reality.” For instance, you may have noticed I often use in writing theexpression “facts of reality.” What have I added to the term “reality” by saying“facts”? I have narrowed it. I have said: whichever aspects, events, orexistents you happen to know, these are the facts of reality—meaning: these arethe things which actually exist. So it is like concretizing a very wideabstraction, such as “reality,” but it isn’t adding any new content.Prof. B: That’s what I was struggling to name by this “bit-by-bit” idea—that wedon’t grasp reality like God would, all at once.AR: Ah, that’s correct then. In that sense, yes.023 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_023_r1.jpg]Prof. F: Is every fact complex?AR: Well, as we discussed, “fact” is a very broad term. You can apply it to asingle concept, or to a very complex series of events. That depends on what youdesignate by “fact.” The table’s existence as a fact is simple. But that theUnited States has been in existence almost two hundred years—that’s a verycomplex fact.Prof. E: I think there’s a possible equivocation here on “simple” and “complex.”In asking whether a fact is complex or simple you can mean it in the sense ofdifficult to grasp or easy to grasp; or you could mean it in the sense ofdivisible into components or indivisible, in which case I don’t think thedistinction applies to facts. Entities are divisible, but how would you divide afact?Prof. B: Into the entity and the attribute.AR: Is that what you meant?Prof. F: Yes.Prof. E: But you wouldn’t say a fact is metaphysically divisible or indivisible.Neither concept applies.AR: No, it wouldn’t apply.Prof. E: Bertrand Russell, in one mood, upheld a division between simple andcomplex facts. But also there were atomic facts and molecular facts, negativefacts, general facts, and so on.AR: Yes. I reject that sort of thing. Because if by “simple” you meanmetaphysically primary, then only entities are metaphysical primaries.The real issue here is always to define your context. Because if you mean howmany concepts are necessary to grasp that the table exists vs. that the table isround, you can see that one requires more conceptualized knowledge than theother. But if you mean to ask, “Is ‘fact’ a primary?” that’s different.This issue bears all the earmarks of Russell, because observe what the mistakeis. He is taking a concept out of any hierarchy; he is not concerned with thehierarchical structure of concepts. In fact that is what he would denyvehemently. I don’t think he would even be able to grasp what we meant by“hierarchy.” He is the man who claims you can take anything as an axiom and workfrom there—and the result is most of modern philosophy (except I wouldn’tascribe it to his influence). But that is the institutionalization of all theworst anti-existence errors, of starting without axioms, or denying axioms,or—what amounts to the same thing—making axioms arbitrary.In asking yourself whether any concept is of a metaphysical primary, you have toask yourself: to what does that concept refer? And once you observe that theword “fact” is a term which can be applied to a very broad category ofphenomena, and actually that it is helpful only in order to subdivide a verywide idea, such as existence or reality, you know it is not a primary. It’s acomplex, derivative concept.THE PHYSICAL WORLDProf. K: Some philosophers treat our knowledge that existence exists asequivalent to our knowledge that there is a physical world. They hold that toknow that existence exists, and is what it is independently of our perceivingit, is to know that it is different in kind from consciousness—to know thatthings exist which possess characteristics which no consciousness couldpossess—for example, spatial extension or weight. Then they claim that thepropositions “existence exists” and “there is a physical world” are, if notsynonymous, two perspectives on the same fact, such that if the first is anaxiom, then so is the second. Is any variant of this position consistent withthe Objectivist view of axioms and axiomatic concepts?AR: The answer is: no, emphatically. Not consistent in any way whatever. Now letme elaborate.When you say “existence exists,” you are not saying that the physical worldexists, because the literal meaning of the term “physical world” involves a verysophisticated piece of scientific knowledge at which logically andchronologically you would have to arrive much later.As to the chronological aspect, the construct that you describe here is totallyimpossible psychologically. You say that to grasp that something exists is toknow that things exist which possess characteristics which no consciousnesscould possibly possess, such as extension and weight. You are talking about anenormously sophisticated level of knowledge. And you are assuming that first aman grasps that he’s conscious, à la Descartes, and then he decides, “But thereare certain things which have properties which consciousness doesn’t have.”Nothing could be further from the truth.The simplest way to begin an answer is to point out that animals, who doperceive reality or existence, have absolutely no concept of their ownconsciousness. The enormous distinction between man and animals here isself-consciousness. An animal does not have the capacity to isolate criticallythe fact that there is something and he is conscious of it. How does that applyto man? In this crucial sense: neither does an infant. Why is it metaphysicallyimportant? Because there is no such thing as a consciousness per se, apart fromthat of which it is conscious. And therefore no entity could conceivably beconscious first of the fact that he is conscious and then grasp, “Oh, I’mconscious of something.”You see, this is a complete inversion of the meaning of the concepts. You canbecome aware of the fact that you are conscious only after the fact ofperforming an act of consciousness. Only after you have become conscious ofsomething—and in fact long after—can you identify the fact that it is somefunction in your mind that is performing this process of awareness. Only at arelatively advanced age—after, say, months or perhaps a full year—can an infantgrasp the fact that if he closes his eyes he doesn’t see, if he opens them hesees. And that if he closes off his ears, then he doesn’t hear. That’s thebeginning of his grasp of the fact that something operates inside of him thatpermits the process of awareness. But that is an enormously sophisticated stepof self-consciousness. You cannot begin by saying, “I’m conscious” and then ask,“Of what?” It’s a contradiction—in effect, a process of concept-stealing.As to such characteristics as extension and weight, how would you grasp thoseahead of grasping the existence of an outside world? Because the implication ofyour question is that you grasp that it is a physical world by means ofobserving that it has certain properties which your consciousness does notpossess. But you could not have any concept of those properties ahead ofgrasping a physical world, nor could you say, “My consciousness doesn’t possessweight or extension,” ahead of grasping that there is something outside whichdoes possess them.But now what’s the difference between saying “existence exists” and “thephysical world exists”? “Existence exists” does not specify what exists. It is aformula which would cover the first sensation of an infant or the most complexknowledge of a scientist. It applies equally to both. It is only the fact ofrecognizing: there is something. This comes before you grasp that you areperforming an act of consciousness. It’s only the recognition that somethingexists. By the time you say that it’s a world, and it’s a physical world, youneed to know much more. Because you can’t say “physical world” before you havegrasped, self-consciously, the process of awareness and have said, “Well, thereare such existents as mental events, like thinking or memories or emotions,which are not physical; they are existents, but of a different kind: they arecertain states or processes of my consciousness, my faculty of grasping theexistence of that outside world.” And the next step is: “What is that outsideworld made of?”The concept “matter,” which we all take for granted, is an enormously complexscientific concept. And I think it was probably one of the greatest achievementsof thinkers ever to arrive at the concept “matter,” and to recognize that thatis what the physical world outside is composed of, and that’s what we mean bythe term “physical.”Now observe that a savage doesn’t have a concept of “matter.” He believes thatreality is like his own consciousness, only it is in the power of supernaturalcreatures or gods or demons who manipulate it. What permits this kind ofmysticism? Precisely the absence of the concept “physical world” or “matter.”Now those concepts, in historical development and in the development of anindividual consciousness, come very late—by which I mean they are concepts thatrequire a long development before one can grasp them. And yet a savage graspsthat existence exists. He doesn’t grasp all the implications of it. Nor does hegrasp the law of identity. But that something exists, with which he deals, evenhe grasps that. To the extent to which he is able to hunt or to support his lifeor pray to his gods, he is admitting implicitly the existence of something.So you see the axiom “existence exists” embraces all those stages of knowledge,implicit or explicit. Whereas the concept “the physical world exists” is a verysophisticated scientific statement.Prof. E: I just wanted to give a historical corroboration of that from earlyGreek philosophy. In the pre-Socratic period many of the philosophers had greatdifficulty distinguishing between consciousness and the physical world. Thingslike wind and breath were equated with soul and consciousness, as somethingintangible or invisible. They had no clear idea of the distinction.AR: Yes, and they ascribed love and hate or attraction and repulsion to theelements. It was all a kind of groping chaos, in a state before they clearlydifferentiated the two.The original questioner asked whether “existence exists” and “there is aphysical world” are two perspectives on the same fact, and whether the second isalso an axiom. It’s not two perspectives on the same fact. The fact is the same,but one is a fundamental axiom applying to any level of your knowledge, and thesecond is not a different perspective—it’s a statement which is the result of along and complex development of knowledge. The facts are the same in the sensethat when you say “existence exists” you have implicitly stated the propositionof omniscience, because whatever exists—even things of which you have nosuspicion at present—is included in that proposition. It exists. But youwouldn’t say that therefore once you’ve said “existence exists” you knoweverything. No, you’ve merely grasped the principle which applies to everything,but the rest is up to a long, long development of knowledge. And therefore aproposition about the nature of what exists is not the same thing as the axiom.Prof. A: Does “existence exists” implicitly include consciousness as part ofexistence?AR: Here I was very careful in my formulation in Atlas Shrugged: “The act ofgrasping that statement” implies consciousness. Existence exists whether thereis any consciousness or not. But since you are making that claim, in the act ofgrasping it you are introducing the axiom of consciousness.Prof. A: But it doesn’t exclude consciousness. That is, when you say “existenceexists,” you don’t mean: “I am only speaking about external reality and I don’tmean consciousness.”AR: No.Prof. A: Which is what you are saying when you say “the external world exists.”AR: Yes. The axiom “existence exists” is wider than the concept of the externalworld. It includes everything, as I indicated, including your mental states,mental processes, and such phenomena as ideas or feelings, which are not in thesame category as physical reality, but they exist.Prof. E: Would it be fair then to say that there are three stages here at least?The primary philosophic one is existence—AR: Right.Prof. E:—which covers everything no matter what. Then at a certain point youmake the distinction between the “out there” and the “in here,” the external andthe conscious.AR: Right.Prof. E: And then at a later, much more sophisticated stage, you form theconcepts pertaining to the nature of what is out there, such as “matter” and“physical.”AR: That’s right. And there is the necessary corollary: you also develop the“how”—the “how” you know it. In order to define what constitutes knowledge ofwhat is out there, you have to develop the science of epistemology.Prof. B: Isn’t there a sense in which Locke, Berkeley, and Hume—less so Locke,but all of them—don’t really have a concept of existence as a metaphysical fact?AR: No, they don’t.Prof. B: Their concepts refer to mental states or to other concepts. That’s whythey all had the problem: “How do we form the concept of ‘existence’?” And theywent through incredible contortions trying to work that out.AR: Yes.Prof. K: Locke is similar to Descartes in that he considers it a special problemto establish the independent existence of the world. In order to establish thatexistence exists independently of our consciousness we must show that oneelement of existence is something that our consciousness could not give toexistence.AR: Yes, that is the way they would approach it, but what it literally amountsto is: in order to validate the existence of an outside world, we have tointroduce something mystical, something unknowable, something not of this worldand not of our knowledge. Locke and Descartes achieve the exact opposite oftheir intention. Whereas actually what Descartes, and all of them, should havedone is ask themselves the origin of the concept “consciousness” —since theymeant something by that concept and they referred to something, their innermental state. They never considered the fact that there can be no such thing asconsciousness if it is not conscious of anything.They put consciousness first—as if that is the absolute, the given—and then wehave to prove the existence of something outside of it. Incidentally, in allsuch theories of the primacy of consciousness, whenever reality doesn’t conformto what their consciousness decides is true, it is reality that then isdismissed. Again, it is the absolute negation of “existence exists” as an axiom.That is the error of starting in midstream. That was my original “Rand’s Razor”:that in an ideal Atlantis, every philosopher would be asked to name his axiomsbefore being permitted to utter a proposition. And boy would the field shrink.Prof. B: Teaching would be easier.AR: Oh, and how! And you would have better pupils.“SELF”Prof. K: I’d like to ask a question about something which is intuitively obviousto me, but which I couldn’t defend in argument: the statement that to be awareof your own consciousness has, as a corollary, that you exist possessingconsciousness. How does awareness of states of consciousness have, as acorollary, that there is one faculty, namely your self, which unifies orpossesses all these states and processes?Prof. E: In other words, the question is: why does a series of successive statesof consciousness imply an entity, as distinct from just a disintegrated series?AR: You mean Mr. Hume?Prof. E: Right.AR: Read the chapter on axiomatic concepts. You don’t need “intuition” here, youneed to remember very clearly the fallacy of the “stolen concept.” What do youmean by a “series of states of consciousness”? Anyone who offers that argumentto you is guilty of the crudest form of concept-stealing. There is no such thingas a state of consciousness without the person experiencing it. What does onemean by “state of consciousness”? A state of a faculty possessed by an entity.Consciousness is not a primary object, it is not an independent existent, it’san attribute of a certain kind of existents.You cannot project what you mean by a state of consciousness—neither by synonymsnor in any way—without referring to the person or the animal who possesses thatconsciousness: an entity of whom consciousness is a faculty. It is not possibleto project it.Now why isn’t it possible? Because such a thing as a state of consciousness isobviously a derivative concept—derivative qua attribute. It’s a primary, as faras the conceptual chain is concerned, but in regard to observation, you have noway of experiencing or observing a state of consciousness without the entitywhich experiences it. It’s a concept that could not enter your mind or yourlanguage unless in the form of a faculty of a living entity. That’s what thatconcept means. Therefore to ask, “Well, I know I have states, but how does itprove that I am?”—is a question that’s not worth discussing.Incidentally, I know a lady who once gave the proper answer to that kind ofquestion, the kind of question you have been confronted with, so let me quoteher with the appropriate answer. Some young college student said to her, “Idon’t know whether I exist,” which is the same issue. She said, “You’d betterfind out, because I don’t want to be caught talking to myself.” And that’s aboutthe seriousness this question deserves.The consciousness of self is implicit in [any grasp] of consciousness.Prof. D: Is the concept of “self” something abstracted from a content ofconsciousness?AR: No. The notion of “self” is an axiomatic concept; it’s implicit in theconcept of “consciousness”; it can’t be separated from it.Prof. D: In other words, what one really has here is something like Descartes’innate idea.AR: How?Prof. D: Well, because implicit in the concept of “consciousness” or “I think”in Descartes is “I.” That’s implicit there, so that you cannot have the onewithout the other; and it isn’t experiential.AR: Oh, no, but in Descartes you have consciousness without content. He takesconsciousness as a primary, not as depending on being conscious of something. Infact he says it is possible to be conscious of nothing, which is a contradictionin terms. We don’t say that the “I” is an innate idea.Prof. D: I know, but I don’t see any difference, though.AR: The “I” cannot be developed without the content of consciousness, and thatcontent is not innate.Prof. D: But the content is never the “I” itself. And, in fact, Descartes wouldsay all thinking has objects, except—AR: Wait a moment, let’s start at the beginning. Descartes says thatconsciousness or the “I” is something innate, apart from any content. In otherwords, apart from perceiving anything, you have that idea of the “I” or of “Ithink”; you have those ideas before you think of anything or have anything tothink about. That’s the difference.Now what I say is: before your conscious apparatus, the faculty ofconsciousness, is aware of something, it is not conscious, and certainly thereis no “I.” But when you become aware, implicit in your first sensation arecertain axiomatic concepts. And they are what? That you exist, that the outsideworld exists, and that you are conscious. The baby could not conceptualize this,but it’s implicit; without that implication he couldn’t be aware of anything.Therefore it’s not an “innate idea,” it’s a corollary of the fact ofconsciousness.Prof. D: So when a consciousness becomes conscious of an object, that objectwill not be the self; but implicit in the consciousness of the object will bethe idea of a self having it.AR: That’s right.Prof. D: That is no different though, essentially, from Descartes.AR: It has to be different, because if it were the same how would you go fromthat to the idea that you have to prove the existence of an outside world? IfDescartes claimed that implicit in the first sensation from the outside arecertain concepts such as “I” and “consciousness,” he would be wedded to theprimacy of the exterior world. He would say, “Well if the world doesn’t exist, Ican’t be conscious.” That isn’t what he said.Prof. D: The idea of an external world wasn’t an innate idea, though, inDescartes.AR: But are you suggesting in any way that we are here dealing with innateideas?Prof. D: Well, it looks that way.AR: Well yes, if you drop the context.Prof. E: There’s an enormous confusion throughout the Rationalist traditionbetween two things: a concept which has introspective referents as against aninnate idea. And these philosophers constantly go from one to the other.AR: As interchangeable.Prof. E: As interchangeable. As though if all you have to do is introspect todiscover the referents of a concept, it follows that the idea of those referentsis innate. Which is a complete non sequitur.AR: But you see that’s what I mean by the dropping of the context.Prof. E: Descartes can say that we are aware of the self by the sheer act ofbeing conscious and being implicitly aware of our consciousness; he calls thatan innate idea, and proceeds to say that in the same way we have an innate ideaof God. Because he switches from defining an “innate” idea as a conceptualizedrecognition of something in advance of experience to calling an “innate” ideaany concept which is formed by a process of thought based upon introspectivedata.AR: Exactly.Prof. E: Let’s look at the definition of “implicit.” On page 6, it is applied to“existence,” but the same thing would be applicable to “consciousness.” Aconcept is implicit when one “grasps the constituents of the concept ... thedata which are later to be integrated by that concept.”Prof. D: But if my self is not one of the constituents of the content ofconsciousness, then “implicit” must have a different sense here from the senseit has in cases where the contents are present but not put together. Or do youwant to say that I am put together out of contents of consciousness?AR: No, you are the precondition of the concept of “consciousness.” In everystate of consciousness that you experience, part of it is the fact of the personwho experiences. And in that sense you are implicit in every state of yourconsciousness.Prof. E: In other words the only fact of reality that you’d have to get in ordersubsequently to form the concept “self” or “I” would be your being conscious.AR: That’s right.Prof. B: Is this correct? When you introspect, it’s not that what you observe isa state of consciousness, so that when it comes time to form the concept of“self,” there’s nothing to form it from. When you introspect, what youexperience each time is “me being conscious of something.”AR: Yes.Prof. B: It’s not that you experience consciousness and later on you discover anew component: self.AR: Exactly.Prof. B: Every awareness is: me experiencing something.AR: Exactly. You know the best example I could give—perhaps this will help. Ifyou brought a dog or a cat into this room, it would be aware of everything thatwe see here. It would also see the room, the objects, and the people. What itwould never be able to grasp is, “I am conscious of this room,” although thatfact is inherent in its perception. The difference between its consciousness anda human consciousness is that looking at that room we are able to say, “It takesan act of consciousness to be aware of all this, and it’s I, my consciousness,that’s performing that act.” That is, I am aware of this room, and I can projectclosing my eyes and my awareness stops—at least visually. Or I can projectfainting or sleeping and not being aware at all. But an animal cannot do that.If he falls asleep, then that’s one state; when he awakens, it’s another. But hewouldn’t be capable of identifying conceptually material which is present therein his consciousness: that it is he who is aware and at other times he is notaware.The whole difference between a human type of consciousness and an animal isexactly this. The ability to be self-conscious and to identify the fact of one’sown consciousness, one’s “I.” And then to apply introspection to the processesof one’s own consciousness and check them.TIMEProf. B: On page 56, you say: “The measurements omitted from axiomatic conceptsare all the measurements of all the existents they subsume; what is retained,metaphysically, is only a fundamental fact; what is retained, epistemologically,is only one category of measurement, omitting its particulars: time ...” Couldyou elaborate on the distinction between retaining metaphysically and retainingepistemologically, and does that distinction apply to other concepts, too?AR: In a sense. What I mean here by “metaphysically” is: in reality, inexistence—that is, focusing on the entities subsumed under that concept. By“epistemologically” here I mean psychologically. In the process of cognition,what type of measurement do you retain when you deal with a concept thatincludes every existent?Now, there are some very important things I would like to say about the issue oftime. In the very next paragraph I say that these concepts “identify explicitlythe omission of psychological time measurements, which is implicit in all otherconcepts.” That is an important point to keep in mind. When you form a concept,it is independent of time. That is, if you form the concept “table,” implicit inthat mental process is the fact that any time you encounter an entity withcertain characteristics you will designate it as a table. Or, every time you seethe same table you still designate it by the concept “table.” In other words,your concept is independent of any particular moment of perception. Whereas asensation or a percept is strictly dependent on the immediate moment ofawareness. One of the reasons why a concept permits us to enlarge our knowledgeto such a phenomenal extent lies precisely in the fact that a concept isindependent of any given moment. It is a form of classifying and retaining as amental unit a certain classification of perceptual concretes, which you thenhold at all times."},{"pageContent":"Now, a non-axiomatic concept, such as “table,” implicitly holds only this much:that you will always refer to a given type of object as a table. But axiomaticconcepts have a wider function. Time is involved in them epistemologically orpsychologically in a more important manner: they have to be held in yourconsciousness at all times. It isn’t only that what you call existence today youwill also call existence tomorrow, but also that in all future processes ofcognition the axiomatic concepts are directing that process. You cannot formanother concept or utter a proposition without regard for your axiomaticconcepts, once they have been consciously identified. They function implicitlyup to the time of identification. Thereafter, they have to be explicit; theyhave to be automatized psychologically. And all the disasters that you observein philosophy are due, in part, precisely to not observing the timelessness ofaxiomatic concepts; they are used while being negated.024 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_024_r1.jpg]Prof. A: Does the omission of psychological time measurements refer to the factthat concepts are open-ended?AR: The sense in which it refers to open-endedness isn’t the primary issue, it’sthe consequence. When you form a concept, you implicitly state to yourself thatyou will subsume under this concept any future object of this kind. That’s howthe omission of time-measurements relates to open-endedness.But more importantly, the omission of psychological time-measurements, for bothnormal concepts and axiomatic concepts, refers to the fact that concepts areindependent of the time of your awareness. Whereas percepts are dependent on thespecific presence of the object of perception before you, concepts are notdependent on time. When you have formed a concept as a mental unit, itsexistence doesn’t depend on any given moment you are using it or considering it.It may be dormant in your memory while you are dealing with other matters. Whenyou need that particular concept, you can deal with it regardless of what youare perceiving out there in reality; it’s not dependent on that.Prof. A: Is the following correct? A percept is of a particular thing at aparticular time; and when you later remember a percept, say your view of MountRushmore, that would be a memory of the way Mount Rushmore looked at thatparticular moment in time.AR: That’s right.Prof. A: Whereas your concept of “man” is not tied to the first three men thatyou formed that concept from. Is that part of what is meant by saying thatconcepts are independent of time?AR: That also. That’s a good addition to what I said. You do not have to recallall the particulars in order to use the concept—it’s independent of memory inthat way. Actually, there are several forms of independence of time: a conceptis independent of recalling any particulars or how you formed it, and it’sindependent of having the particulars before you. You can sit in your room intotal darkness and deal with any concept that you know. You don’t need aparticular event in reality in order to deal with your concepts. Whereas apercept is strictly dependent on a particular event at a particular moment.025 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_025_r1.jpg]Prof. B: What is the hierarchical order of the concepts “motion,” “duration,”and “time”? First, is “duration” an axiomatic concept?AR: No, “duration” is definitely a derivative concept—derived from “time.”Because “duration” means the time necessary for a certain event or thetime-measurement that is involved in a certain process. So duration is clearly aderivative concept, based on the concept of “time.”Prof. B: I would have thought that duration is what time measures, just likeextension is what magnitude measures.AR: No, you have it in reverse. What would you mean by the concept “duration” ifyou have no such concept as “time”? You couldn’t form the concept “duration”first and then derive from it the concept “time.” It would have to be the otherway around. You form the concept “time,” and then in regard to particularprocesses or events you form the concept “duration”—for example, how long ittakes you to cross the room. But, in order to conceptualize the duration of yourwalk across the room, you have to have a concept of what it is that you want tomeasure. And that is: time.Prof. B: I had approached it this way. It is clear that in some sense time isthe measure of motion. But motion has several attributes. For example, wemeasure the rate of motion, and that is the distance covered in a certain time.So I asked myself: what is it about motion that time measures? And I answered:the duration of motion.AR: Yes, but that is what you grasp after you realize the relationship of timeto motion. The two interrelated concepts are “motion” and “time.” Becauseobserve, to grasp “motion” you have to grasp a change. A change of what? Of[spatial] relationships among entities. If you see some stationary objects andone object that is moving, you grasp the fact that it is moving by seeing thechanged relationship between it and the other objects, and that gives you theconcept of “time.” At a given moment, let’s say it is to the right of the firststationary object, a few minutes later it is to the left, then it passes thenext stationary object. It is the progression of the motion that gives you theconcept of “time.”But “duration” is already a delimited concept. You would have to ask yourself,“How long will it take this object to pass, let us say, three stationaryobjects?”Prof. B: You relate it to some unit of motion.AR: Yes. And that is already a complex derivative concept because you areconsciously measuring a given process of motion.Prof. B: Then I have trouble distinguishing what is being measured by time onthe one hand and speed or velocity on the other hand. Because what is it aboutthe motion that time is measuring?AR: “Time,” as the widest or parent abstraction of all subsequent and narrowermeasurements of time, is a change of relationship. You observe that certainrelationships are changed, and you form the concept “time.” Then you cansubdivide it into speed or duration or any other measurements. Speed andduration are really two aspects of the same type of measurement. Continue withthe example of an object moving past some stationary objects. To measure theduration, you would have to define the beginning and the end of this process—howlong will it take this object to pass three stationary points. And you measurethe total of the process. To measure its speed, you have to already haveestablished a unit of time-measurement. Suppose your unit is the second. Youwould say this object is moving at so many inches per second. You have to have aunit, which would consist of the amount of time taken to cover a certain amountof space. And you use that to measure the speed of a given process.Prof. E: Do you have to form the concept of “duration” before the concept ofvelocity?AR: Oh, yes. The concept that there are units of time, that it can be measured.Prof. E: Duration is just really units of time, stretches of time?AR: For the completion of a given defined process. You really here have to havethe concept of the beginning and the end of the process.THREE FUNCTIONS OF AXIOMATIC CONCEPTSProf. E: After reading the chapter on axiomatic concepts, I tried to list theirmain functions. I could distinguish three functions, even though I am aware thatall of them are enormously interrelated. I wondered if I had omitted anythingthat you thought was crucial. The first is the continuity function; the secondis objectivity, in the sense of focusing on the distinction between existenceand consciousness and on the independence of existence. And the third is theunderscoring of primary facts. Is it fair to say that those are three main,highly interrelated functions of axiomatic concepts? Have I left out something?AR: I have never asked myself that question. But offhand, I think you haveincluded the essentials. Name them again.Prof. E: Enabling human consciousness to preserve continuity, the idea of thecontinuity of existence and consciousness—the issue of psychologicaltime-measurements.AR: Yes.Prof. E: Second: generating the ability to be objective by emphasizingexistence, with identity, as independent of consciousness. And third: the issueof underscoring primary facts, which you mention on page 59.AR: The reason that I asked you to repeat them is that the last one is the one Iwould regard as most important. The confining of knowledge to reality, toexistence, and delimiting it from non-existence, imagination, falsehood, etc.They are all interrelated, but that I would name first.I would add one more that is also closely related, so it might be a restatement,but it is an important restatement: epistemological guidance.Prof. A: I don’t fully understand the idea of the continuity function. Howexactly do those three axioms preserve the continuity of your life?AR: Not of your life, but of your cognitive operations and your knowledge. Theaxioms underscore first that these concepts are what they are at any time,independent of any perceptual or existential experience. If you say “existenceexists” or “consciousness is conscious,” that would be so at any time, that’simmutable. That’s point one. And point two is that you have to hold them in mindat all times. And that’s why I mentioned their function as epistemologicalguidelines: during any cognitive process, you check your knowledge against thoseaxioms. And if you come out with something that exists and doesn’t exist at thesame time, you know that you have made a mistake somewhere.THE EXPLICIT FORMULATION OF AXIOMATIC CONCEPTSProf. B: In Chapter 1 you described the stages of development of the implicitconcept of “existent.” My question is, in the process of forming axiomaticconcepts explicitly, are there necessary stages of development?AR: Similar to the variations of the implicit concept “existent”?Prof. B: Not necessarily. Just in general.AR: To reach axiomatic concepts consciously, you have to have a certain amountof knowledge about epistemology. You do not need knowledge of a full,philosophical theory of epistemology, but you have to have theself-consciousness to identify explicitly certain elements in your knowledgewhich have been implicit up to then. It requires a sufficient amount ofknowledge and a very significant degree of introspection. The ability tointrospect is necessary to begin to identify the implicit explicitly. And forthat there has to be the material of introspection. So you have to have asufficient knowledge both of the outside world and of the process of your ownconsciousness before you can begin to identify the widest abstractions.Prof. E: In the development of the human race philosophically, the threeaxiomatic concepts were explicitly grasped for the first time at definitelydifferent periods of history and in a definite order: “existence” by Parmenides,“identity” by Aristotle, and “consciousness,” as far as I know, not untilAugustine.AR: Why would you say not until Augustine?Prof. E: I don’t think there was any actual concept of “consciousness” in Greekphilosophy.AR: But what of Aristotle’s psychology, with the concept of “soul” asconsciousness?Prof. E: Yes, but “soul” as he used it is more of a biological concept than amental one.Prof. B: Aristotle has “thinking,” he has “feeling,” he has “imagining,” but hedoesn’t seem to have “consciousness” as an integration of those. The next levelof abstraction for him is “soul,” which applies to all living things qua living.AR: You mean Augustine was the first to isolate “consciousness” as a concept inthe Cartesian sense?Prof. E: Yes. “Si fallor, sum.”AR: Oh, that’s interesting.Prof. E: The human race developed the three axioms in the right order.Prof. B: Good for us!AR: It’s a very interesting observation from another aspect, too. You know it’sbeen said many times that the human race follows in a general way the stages ofdevelopment of an individual. And this would be an instance of that. But Ishudder to think of the time elements involved, if it takes that long. It’s aninteresting observation, however.ENTITIES AND THEIR MAKEUPWHAT IS AN ENTITY?Prof. K: I would like to ask you to clarify your use of the term “entity.”Specifically, on page 15, in speaking of perceptual entities, you state,“entities are the only primary existents.” Now, does this imply that you grantthat there is a metaphysical status of entity apart from whether or notsomething is a perceptual entity?For example, is it in principle possible for a perceptual entity to be composedof constituents which are metaphysically themselves also entities, such as abrick wall with the individual bricks also retaining their status as entities?AR: Certainly. What about human beings? Heads, arms, and legs can be cut off andthey are entities. But I was speaking here in the context of entity as againstattribute or action. Actually, I was speaking here in the Aristotelian sense ofthe primary “substance”—which is a very misleading term, but what he meant wasthat the primary existent is an entity. And then aspects of an entity can beidentified mentally, but only in relation to the entity. There are no attributeswithout entities, there are no actions without entities.An entity is that which you perceive and which can exist by itself.Characteristics, qualities, attributes, actions, relationships do not exist bythemselves.But, now, if you ask me what is the relationship of parts of an entity to theentity: metaphysically they exist, so that if you, for instance, cut off thelegs of this table, the top will exist by itself and the legs will exist bythemselves.Now, epistemologically, you could regard the top and the legs as attributes ofthe table in the sense that, if you cut them off, what remains is no longer atable. But that would be only an epistemological method of regarding a part ofan entity [as if the part were an attribute]. Metaphysically, the separatedparts will continue to exist, only they will no longer be in the form of atable.You know, there is a great validity in looking at it that way,epistemologically, provided you always remember the metaphysical difference[between parts and attributes]. Length cannot exist without something which islong; an action cannot exist without something that acts. But parts of an entitycan exist separately; but if they are separated, the entity is no longer thesame kind of entity.For instance, if you remove the picture tube from a television set, you willhave a tube on one side and a box on the other. They still exist. But if youregard a television set as an entity, then if you remove that which makes it atelevision set—the works—what remains is no longer a television set, even thoughthe parts exist separately. Or, if you cut a man’s head off, what you have is acorpse; you have parts of a man but it is no longer a man. In that sense, youcould regard parts as an attribute of a given entity—as that without which itwould no longer be the same kind of entity. But, metaphysically, you must alwaysremember that the parts can exist separately, whereas attributes and actionscannot exist apart from the entity.Included in the very concept of attributes is the fact that they are parts whichyou can separate only mentally, but which cannot exist by themselves. That isthe difference between “part” and “attribute.”Prof. K: If we separate the organs of the body from the body, not only will thebody change but the separated organ will change, decompose, and so forth. Butthat will not happen to the brick taken out of a brick wall. Can philosophyspecify this difference as a criterion for deciding whether or not somethingcould be validly viewed as a part, in addition to being viewed as an attribute?AR: But you are mixing terms here. The fact that human organs deteriorate but abrick does not has no relation to the issue at all. That is not a philosophicalissue, it is an issue of the fact that living organisms deteriorate—well, so dobricks, but it takes them longer. That does not pertain to the question you areasking. It isn’t by means of observing what happens to separated parts that youdecide whether something is a part or an attribute. If it can be separated for asplit second it is a part, it is not an attribute. An attribute is that whichcannot be physically separated. Now, what is an entity? It is a sum ofcharacteristics. There is no such thing as an entity without itscharacteristics, and, for that very reason, there is no such thing as acharacteristic without an entity.Prof. A: I don’t want to seize on a formulation which you may not have meant tobe taken literally, but you said that an entity is the sum of itscharacteristics or attributes.AR: Don’t take “sum” literally, no. Not in the sense that you would say “sum ofits parts.” Usually when I write I say the entity is its attributes. To beexact, you’d have to treat them as inseparable.Prof. A: That follows from “existence is identity”—in other words, there can’tbe a “substratum” that has no identity with the attributes just inhering inthat.AR: Exactly. You mean the Lockean idea?Prof. A: Yes, where each attribute—AR:—is hung on an ineffable substratum. No—the attributes are the entity, or anentity is its attributes. The attributes are really separable only byabstraction.When you form concepts of attributes, all you have done, if you are preciseabout it, is to have mentally stated, “By ‘length’ I mean a certain aspect of anexisting entity, by ‘color’ I mean a certain aspect of an existingentity”—parenthesis: “which cannot, in fact, be separated from the entity.” Thatis implicit in forming the concept. Therefore, once you say that anything,anything whatever on any level, can be separated from an entity and can exist,it doesn’t matter whether it deteriorates in two days or two centuries. If itcan exist by itself, it is a part and not an attribute.Prof. E: I think he is attempting to show that a living thing has a kind ofunity that no mechanical juxtaposition of parts could possess, and thattherefore there is a metaphysical basis for distinguishing a living whole fromany other type of wholes.AR: Oh, but that is almost self-evident, isn’t it? That is implicit in thedistinction between inanimate objects and living entities.Prof. E: Well, he is trying to characterize that distinction by saying that, inthe case of inanimate things, you could explain the behavior of the totalityexclusively on the basis of the characteristics of the parts, without takinginto account the additional fact that they are combined into a whole. Whereas,in the case of living things, you can explain it only by virtue of theircombination into a whole; therefore, living things have a kind of unity that theinanimate doesn’t.AR: But you can establish that by other means. In other words, you don’t have togo into the issue of relationship of parts to whole, in order to prove somethingwhich is apparent by means of other observations. The fact that parts of aliving entity will deteriorate without the whole isn’t philosophicallyexplicable by a different kind of philosophical category. It is explicable bythe nature of what is a living entity as against an inanimate object. And thetwo concepts have to be established empirically. You have to first observe thedifference, then establish what are the essential characteristics of a livingentity as against an inanimate object. After you have established the essentialsof what is a living organism, as a consequence of that you will be able toexplain why the parts of a living entity, if cut off, deteriorate. But if youtry to base it all on just that observation about the parts, I’m afraid youwould have a Rube Gold-berg set-up—trying to prove something [philosophically]which can be demonstrated as a consequence by a different method.026 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_026_r1.jpg]AR: A part of an entity is something that can be separated.Prof. E: And then becomes an entity, when it’s separated.AR:Yes.Prof. B: Is a pile of dirt an entity? Or a mountain?AR: A mountain would be an entity.Prof. B: But it’s just a heap or pile of sand.AR: It’s not a pile of sand, no. It’s minerals, metals, and whatever else amountain is composed of, which are welded together in a certain form. You knowhow I would draw the distinction here? We call an entity that which is weldedtogether physically and about which we can learn something, to which we canascribe certain properties, as a whole.But now as to a pile of dirt, we can only call it a “pile” for convenience ofidentification, because there is nothing we can learn about the pile as a whole,nor does it have any particular attributes qua pile. It’s only separate entitiesput together with no consequent change in their status or in their aggregatepotentialities.Prof. E: Suppose you took that pile of dirt and poured glue into it so that itbecame all welded together, and then it could roll back and forth, you wouldstill not learn anything about the total that you couldn’t tell about theconstituents, but it would be welded together.AR: It would be an entity then.Prof. E: Well, what would you learn about the total qua total?AR: Only the things which it would do then—that it could roll but the pile ofdirt couldn’t (if you tried to make the pile move, it would spread across thefloor).Prof. E: You’re not bothered at all about the fact that the mountain is notspatially separable from the earth? You don’t regard spatial separability asintrinsic to an entity?AR: What do you mean by spatial separability?Prof. E: The mountain is stuck to the earth.Prof. B: So is a tree.Prof. E: Yeah, but you could uproot a tree.Prof. B: You could uproot a mountain, if you were strong enough.Prof. E: That’s true, I never thought of that.Prof. B: But on the other hand, if you look at the earth’s surface, it iscontinuous—the surface goes across, and up, and down.AR: And that which goes up is what you define as a mountain.Prof. B: But the mountain is welded to the crust of the earth—it’s just a kindof protuberance of the crust of the earth.Prof. E: The mountain is an entity and the earth, with the mountain, is anentity—and that’s not a contradiction.AR: Oh, of course not. It’s the same issue as inbuilt furniture in a room, likea desk which is built into the room, it doesn’t become entity-less by beingattached to the wall; it’s still a separate entity, only it’s attached to thewall.Prof. F: So is a built-in closet an entity?AR: Yes, certainly. Because you distinguish it from the room; it’s not the room.But let me give you the arch-example of this type of consideration. What about asquare inch of ground? Is that an entity or not? You can, from anepistemological viewpoint, regard any part of an entity as a separate entity inthat context. And a square inch of ground would be just that. The entity wouldbe the whole ground; you delimit it and examine one square inch of it. In thecontext of your examination, it’s a specific entity, that particular inch, eventhough metaphysically, in reality, it’s part of many, many other inches like it.The concept of “entity” is an issue of the context in which you define yourterms. So that an entity has to be a material object, but what you regard as anentity in any given statement or inquiry depends on your definitions. You canregard part of an entity as a separate entity. And in that sense all the vitalorgans are entities, and you have a separate science for the brain or the heartor the stomach. And in the context of that science, you study them as separateentities, never dropping the context that they are vital organs of a totalentity which is a human being.Prof. E: Is it intrinsic to the concept of “entity,” in any context, that it becapable of some form of action?AR: No, not necessarily. Except that everything existing is capable of some formof action.Prof. F: Would there be any context in which an individual human being would notbe an entity?AR: Almost any of them today. [Laughter]Prof. E: That’s an equivocation.AR: I know, that wasn’t a serious comment.Prof. F: You certainly can’t subsume an individual into society in the same waythat you can subsume the liver into an individual.AR: Oh, no. That’s a very important point.Prof. F: So there seems to be no context wherein you can say an individual humanbeing is not an entity. Well then, that’s an exception to the generalization youmade.Prof. B: No, it wasn’t said that everything can be viewed in some context as notan entity. It was the other way around: every part of an entity can in somecontext be viewed as an entity.Prof. F: I thought that what Miss Rand said was that whether you view a thing asan entity or not depends on the context in which you are viewing it.AR: Oh, no. You can view a part of an entity as an entity without dropping thecontext: you will have to include the context that it is part of an entity, suchas the human vital organs. Or: if you cut off an arm, what is it? Well, it’s ahuman arm, but now it will not function as a living part of a living being.Still, it is an entity of a certain kind: a dying part of a human being. In thesame way you can look at an inch of ground and consider it an entity, but thatdoesn’t mean that you can then drop the context and say, “This inch is hangingalone in a vacuum, it’s not part of a plain.” You can narrow or widen your view,but you can never drop the identity—the basic definition—of the entity which youare considering.Similarly, there is a way in which you can in fact not consider man as anentity—speaking metaphorically: if you discuss a society.Prof. E: Not an entity!AR: Now wait. For the purposes of your discussion, if you are drawing certainconclusions about socio-political laws, and you say, “A society organized as adictatorship will always have such and such consequences.” Now, you are not herediscussing particular men; you are discussing a collective whole. You areconsidering it as an entity, but you must always remember the definition of yourentity—which is: a number of individual human entities living in the samegeographical locality under the same laws, etc.Prof. E: But how does it differ from the heap of dirt, in that it is not weldedtogether?AR: But it is welded together when you are talking about a society. It is weldedtogether by certain laws and by geographical location. You can consider it thatway, but that doesn’t mean you then consider human beings as dispensable cellsof it, which is precisely the mistake all the collectivists make. You candiscuss society as an entity, never forgetting that what you mean by “society”is a large number of human entities.Human beings in a society are tied together by, let’s say, political laws and bycommon geographical location. In discussing society, you are discussing acollection of entities tied together by certain kinds of laws. And then you candetermine what kind of organization is proper in regard to this entity and whatkind is improper.Prof. E: Just to nail this down: I would always have said against Plato orHegel, for instance, that society is not an entity, it’s a collection ofentities. What would you say?AR: You distinguish the epistemological aspect from the metaphysical in thissense: you are saying, “I am considering this inch of ground or I am studyingthis human organ, but I know that metaphysically it’s part of a wider space ofground or of a living human being.” In the same way, you are permitted to regardas an entity, for purposes of study, a collection of human beings such as asociety, but you are not permitted then to say that metaphysically it is anorganism, tied together by some ineffable means. You cannot say it is anythingother than a group of a certain kind of entities, living beings, and you regardthem as one entity only from a certain aspect—that they live in the samegeographical locality under the same type of government and laws.So you can discuss the society, but it doesn’t mean that while you arediscussing it you are dropping its definition and regarding man as a non-entity.Prof. E: But then I don’t see why you couldn’t take any disparate collection ofentities and in some context regard it as an entity.AR: They would have to have something in common or be tied together in some way.Prof. E: What if the tie is only physical location?AR: That wouldn’t produce anything new.Prof. F: So it would not be correct to pick out as your entity “all the peoplenow walking on Thirty-fourth Street.”AR: No.Prof. B: Unless they made a mob.AR: Right.Prof. E: Or, “all the things in my pocket”—that wouldn’t be an entity.AR: No, but if you glued them together, they would be.Prof. B: Does that mean that some entities are prior to other entities, or havepriority in being called entities? In other words, you can’t identify a societyas an entity until you have identified the individuals as entities, and the samewith parts of the body.AR: That’s right. But the priority here, metaphysically, would be determinedaccording to which is essential. In other words, you would apply the law offundamentality. Now, epistemologically, the priority is: which do you have toknow before you go to the next one? It’s the hierarchical structure of concepts.You can’t talk about “society” before grasping what man is. And you can’tseparate an inch of ground without grasping that there’s a wider stretch fromwhich you isolate a certain area. Therefore here the priority is both cognitiveand metaphysical.Prof. B: On the metaphysical priority, isn’t there a basic classification ofthings as entities which comes before all these special cases, rather thanseeing them all as equal?AR: Right, they’re not all equal metaphysically. A valley, for instance, orsociety—those epistemologically can be regarded as entities. But a mountain is aprimary entity; the valley is not, it’s a dependent—it’s actually an indentationbetween two mountains if you regard them together. But then what is the primaryentity? Recall what we said about the pile of dirt vs. the mountain: it has tobe a unit of some kind, tied or welded or integrated together, which has certainproperties, and with actions being possible to it as a whole. Such as, you canclimb a mountain, but you can’t do anything with the pile of dirt, unless youglue it together.Prof. B: I would be completely satisfied on this if you could clarify one morething for me, which is: why call the universe an entity, rather than simply acollection, since it doesn’t act as a whole?AR: Well, you can’t really call it an entity in that sense. I don’t think theterm applies. The universe is really the sum of everything that exists. It isn’tan entity in the sense in which you call a table, a chair, or a man an entity.Actually, do you know what we can ascribe to the universe as such, apart fromscientific discovery? Only those fundamentals that we can grasp about existence.Not in the sense of switching contexts and ascribing particular characteristicsto the universe, but we can say: since everything possesses identity, theuniverse possesses identity. Since everything is finite, the universe is finite.But we can’t ascribe space or time or a lot of other things to the universe as awhole.Prof. E: The whole trick in talking about wholes is to remember that they arewholes.AR: The whole trick in talking about anything is to remember what it is you aretalking about, and where your definitions came from, and are they correct. Youalways look back at reality—what do we mean by a given concept, or how did weget it?“ENTITY” VS. “ATTRIBUTE,” “ACTION,” ETC.Prof. E: In any process of concept-formation, you have to differentiate certainconcretes from the field around you. You and I discussed this once in regard toforming the concept of “existence,” but how does differentiation apply toforming the concept of these metaphysical categories: entity, attribute, action,and relation? What would you differentiate entity from? Would it be that youdifferentiate entity from attribute, or attribute from action, in order, as anadult, to form such concepts? Do you differentiate one such category fromanother?AR: Yes, except in one respect. To be exact, you would have to say you learn todifferentiate those concepts by differentiating them from the concept “entity.”Because “entity” has to be the basic concept. And then, as you observe thatentities move or change or they have certain characteristics, you isolate thoseattributes or actions from the concept “entity.” So that the concept “entity”serves as the context. But it is basic.Prof. B: In connection with this, would there be any CCD behind attribute,action, relation?AR: Well yes, in regard to everything based on or derived from the concept“entity,” the CCD is that they all pertain to entities.Prof. B: But there would be no CCD for the whole group of them, includingentity. This is Aristotle’s point about the different categories: there would beno CCD of “being” which is behind entity, attribute, action, etc.AR: No.Prof. E: There is nothing in common between existence and nonexistence on thebasis of which you would differentiate existence from nonexistence.AR: No.Prof. G: May I ask, what was that earlier discussion about existence that youreferred to?Prof. E: I had asked the question, “What do you distinguish existence from,since there is nothing else?” And Miss Rand said, “Look at something. Now closeyour eyes. That is what you are distinguishing it from.” And that made itperfectly clear. It doesn’t imply, of course, that there is a metaphysical zerowhich comes into existence when you close your eyes.Prof. L: Previously you said that the CCD in forming basic categories, such as“attribute” or “action,” would be: entity. But a CCD is always a characteristic.So I have a problem in seeing how “entity” could be a CCD in conceptualizing thebasic categories, like “attribute.”AR: No, remember that the question asked was how do we form concepts of actionsor attributes at all. And I said that we arrive at them from the concept“entity.” But to say that “entity” is the CCD in forming “action” or “attribute”does not mean that you differentiate between actions and attributes on the basisof the fact that they pertain to an entity. Because those two as such areincommensurable. But the common element which permits you to interrelate them[once each has been conceptualized] is the fact that they pertain to an entity.The concept of “attribute” is a concept which you can arrive at after you haveidentified individual attributes. Such as, for instance, by observing differentobjects you will arrive at the concept “length.” Then by weighing them youarrive at the concept “weight.” Then the concept “attribute” will be formed outof these various individual concepts, such as the weight of an object, thelength of an object, the color, etc.Prof. E: Suppose you have conceptualized a whole bunch of individual attributes,and you now want to rise to the level of conceptualizing “attribute” as such,“action” as such, etc. In conceptualizing “attribute,” don’t you have todifferentiate attribute from something, for instance from “action” or from“entity”? And to differentiate the one group from another, there has to be somecommensurable characteristic uniting them. The question then is: what is thecommensurable characteristic uniting attributes as such with actions as such?Must there be something commensurable in common between attributes and actionsin order to follow the rule of the CCD?AR: No, because you do not form the concepts “attribute” and “action” byconsidering them one against the other and differentiating attributes fromactions. You don’t form those concepts that way.If the question is: “What is the CCD for the concept ‘attribute’?” the answeris: “entity.” An attribute is something which is not the entity itself. No oneattribute constitutes the whole entity, but all of them together are theentity—not “possessed by” but “are” the entity.Prof. E: Then is this correct? If you separate blue from green, those are twodistinguishable things existentially, metaphysically. And therefore the issue ofthere being a common characteristic which is reducible to a unit of measurementis involved. But when you “separate” or “distinguish” attribute from entity,those do not have the relationship of green and blue because the entity is itsattributes.AR: That’s correct.Prof. E: So the concept “attribute” still names, existentially, the samefact—namely, entity, but just from a different perspective. And therefore it’s amistake to think there are two different things—the attribute and the entity—andthen ask, “What’s the common denominator uniting them?” That’s the significanceof your remark: an entity is its attributes.AR: That’s right.Prof. B: So you are forming the concept “attribute” by distinguishing it fromentity, not by distinguishing it from action, relationship, etc.?AR: That’s right. By distinguishing it as one aspect or characteristic of anentity, an indivisible aspect or characteristic which cannot be factually,metaphysically, separated and cannot exist by itself.“MATERIAL”Prof. B: In the theory of concept-formation, you want to identify how thevarious types of concepts are formed, and it becomes valuable to distinguish thedifferent aspects of reality—entities, attributes, etc. I think that is one ofthe functions of any table of categories, such as the one Aristotle gave. Now,would you include materials in, as it were, a table of categories the way youinclude attributes, actions, and relationships?AR: No, I only included materials as an example here [page 16] because theprocess by which you form concepts of materials is somewhat different from theprocess of forming other concepts--it’s the same in principle but the actualdetails are somewhat different. And since I was in fact once asked how you formconcepts of materials, I thought it would be valuable to include it here. But“materials” is not a separate metaphysical category, because materials cannotexist except in the form of entities of some kind, nor can entities existwithout materials. That is, physical entities.Prof. B: But in what way is that different from the relation of attributes andentities? Or relations and entities?AR: “Materials” is an abstraction we use to denote what all physical entitieshave in common. The things which we call physical entities are all made of somekind of material. But you can’t consider one without the other.Prof. E: Would it be correct to say that “material” is a classification ofattributes of entities?Prof. B: Entities qua possessing certain attributes.AR: In a way, yes.Prof. E: And from that point of view, it’s a cross-classification to have both“attribute” and “material” as categories.AR: That’s right. You could say that, yes.ATTRIBUTES AS METAPHYSICALProf. A: In regard to the concept of an attribute—for example, “length”—sincethe attribute is something which does not exist separate in reality, is thereferent of the concept of an attribute in the category of the epistemologicalrather than the metaphysical?AR: Oh no, why?Prof. A: Because length doesn’t exist per se in reality. Length is a human formof breaking up the identities of things.AR: Wait a moment, that’s a very, very dangerous statement. Length does exist inreality, only it doesn’t exist by itself. It is not separable from an entity,but it certainly exists in reality. If it didn’t, what would we be doing withour concepts of attributes? They would be pure fantasy then. The only thing thatis epistemological and not metaphysical in the concept of “length” is the act ofmental separation, of considering this attribute separately as if it were aseparate thing.How would you project a physical object which had no length? You couldn’t. Andtherefore if to say it is epistemological rather than metaphysical is to say itexists only in relation to your grasp of it, or it requires your grasp of it inorder to acquire existence—it doesn’t. Surely, if anything is metaphysical,attributes are.Prof. A: If I ask you, then, what is the referent of “length,” would you say“long objects”?AR: Not the objects, the attribute of length in all the objects which possessthat attribute.Prof. A: Isn’t the referent something separated?AR: It’s mentally separated, but it is there in those objects. It doesn’t haveto be an entity to be a referent.Prof. A: I don’t understand then why the referent of the concept “red,” say,isn’t all the red concretes.AR: How about the other attributes of all those red concretes? Is the referentof “red” the length and weight of all the red concretes?Prof. A: No.AR: Well then, obviously the concrete itself isn’t the referent of the concept,but a particular aspect of that concrete, an inseparable aspect.Prof. B: You said that the referent must be separated, or something like that.There’s no reason why the referent of the concept should be separable from theobject.Prof. A: But in the case of attributes, the referent is not the entity but onlyan aspect of the entity. And an aspect cannot exist except as an aspect of thewhole entity.Prof. B: Can you follow that one step further? You say that the referent of“length” must be an aspect, and an aspect cannot exist separately—what is thenext step?Prof. A: The referent is the aspect separated. Is that the wrong premise?Prof. B: The referent is the aspect, not the aspect separated.AR: Exactly.Prof. B: Otherwise you switch metaphysics and epistemology.AR: That’s right. The aspect, not the separation. That’s very well put.THE PRIMARY-SECONDARY QUALITY DICHOTOMY AS FALLACIOUSProf. C: I have a question about the primary-secondary quality distinction. Aquality like bitterness is not an attribute of an object, but it is caused by anattribute. At least I would be tempted to say that.AR: I would not accept the distinction of primary and secondary qualities,because it leads you into enormous pitfalls. It is not a valid distinction.We perceive light vibrations as color. Therefore you would say the color is notin the object. The object absorbs certain parts of the spectrum and reflects theothers, and we perceive that fact of reality by means of the structure of theeye. But then ask yourself: don’t we perceive all attributes by our means ofperception—including length? Everything we perceive is the result of ourprocessing, which is not arbitrary or subjective.The primary-secondary quality distinction is a long philosophical traditionwhich I deny totally. Because there isn’t a single aspect, including length orspatial extension, which is perceived by us without means of perception.Everything we perceive is perceived by some means.Prof. C: Would you put taste and smell in the identical category with length?AR: All of them. Because they would be different forms of the way yourparticular sensory apparatus works in order to grasp something. Consider taste.It relates to the way your particular nerve ends react to certain chemicals orcertain components of the things which you eat. Tastes as such do not existapart from your sensory apparatus. But that which arouses a certain sensation oftaste in you, does it exist or not?Prof. C: Yes, of course. But I would not claim that the object has theparticular taste. I would say that the taste is an effect of the object.AR: Certain elements in the object, when they strike your taste apparatus, yournerve endings, produce a certain sensation. Now take length. How do you becomeaware of length, which is usually taken as a primary quality? Are your eyesinvolved?Prof. C: Yes.AR: What else? You perceive the attribute by means of your eyes, but you canalso perceive it by means of touch. And both these enter your mind as certainsensations conveyed by certain kinds of nerves and nerve endings in response tocertain stimuli. Therefore, if you say that taste is a “secondary quality” butlength is a “primary” one, you are open to the same criticism. Theprimary-secondary distinction in fact starts from the idea that that which weperceive by some specific means is somehow not objective.Now you can properly distinguish that which is in the object from the form inwhich you perceive that quality. But that isn’t the same thing as saying coloris a secondary quality but extension is a primary quality. That isn’t the sameissue at all. Color is a form of perception—something caused by one existingphenomenon, namely wavelength, acting on another phenomenon, namely, the retinaof our eye. That does not make color a “secondary quality,” as if one could saycolor isn’t in the object but extension is.You see, it’s the classification of the attributes of reality according to howand by what means we perceive them that is wrong in that whole classification.The same argument can be made against any sensation, anything that you perceiveby means of your senses.Prof. E: Berkeley did exactly that and came to the conclusion that everything issubjective.Prof. G: Is your position then that all qualities of objects are on an equalfooting in this respect?AR: Not necessarily exactly the same, because for instance, as far as is known(and remember now this is a scientific question, not a philosophical one)—as faras is known, the process by which you establish texture or hardness is simplerthan the process by which you perceive visually. So you would have to have somedreadful disaster occur over your whole skin to lose the sensation of touchaltogether (in fact I don’t know whether that’s even possible), whereas you canlose the capacity of sight simply by having your eyes damaged. A more complexand a more delicate mechanism is involved in vision or hearing than in touch.But that’s all we can say scientifically.Philosophically, the issue is reduced to the question: do we make a distinctionmetaphysically, in regard to the object, on the basis of our form of perception?So that in the perception of sight we can identify a particular sensation,color, whereas in the sensation of touch, we identify roughness or smoothness,let us say, which is closer to the actual quality in the object: a given surfaceis smooth, and an uneven surface will give you a sensation of roughness. So thatit seems—and I stress: it seems as far as we know—that the process there issimpler. But you could claim that the object as such is neither rough norsmooth, because those terms refer to your sensation, just as “color” refers toyour sensation and not to the actual object. A rough object is merely of anuneven surface. But the difference [between sensory qualities] is only one ofthe comparative simplicity and directness by which you perceive one kind ofsensory data vs. another.PROPERTIES, ACTIONS, AND CAUSALITYProf. F: This question has to do with the concept of “property” and itssignificance for causality. In Galt’s speech, you say every action is caused bythe nature of the acting entity. Now, by “the nature of an entity” do you meanthe physical properties of an entity—properties like combustible, fragile,corrosive, and so on?AR: Yes. And also the psychological properties of a consciousness, includingfree will.Prof. E: And also the constitutive properties, because the question herespecifies exclusively examples of potentialities to act in a certain way. Thereare also the properties that constitute the entity—size, weight, material, etc.Prof. F: Yes, I agree with you, but I am trying to phrase it in terms ofdispositional properties so I can get clearly the distinction between thesekinds of properties. So I am going to go on now as if I don’t presuppose thatparticular distinction. My reason for going on is to get it completely clear inmy mind.AR: What are you calling “dispositional properties”?Prof. F: When you say, “That glass is fragile,” you mean only that if you dropit, say on concrete, it will break; you don’t mean it is breaking now at thismoment. To say that an entity is combustible at two hundred degrees Fahrenheitdoes not mean that it is now actually burning. To say that it is corrosive doesnot mean that it is now actually corroding anything. And so on.Indeed, most physical-property concepts are concepts of actions which are notactually occurring. They need “counterfactual” conditions for their definitions.I have to say, “If I drop the glass, it will break,” but actually I haven’tdropped it, so we call that “counterfactual” because as a matter of fact thecondition is not fulfilled.If the physical nature of glass is defined primarily in terms of such propertiesas fragility, and if the identity of glass is its physical nature, it followsthat the identity of glass is determined primarily in terms of itsnon-actualized relations to other entities. There are two problems here. Firstof all the relations are not actualized and secondly there is a reference toother entities in every definition of the identity of a thing.Prof. E: So it leads to the doctrine of “internal relations.”Prof. F: It impinges on internal relations.AR: You are making an artificial dichotomy. Why divide properties into twocategories, first of all?To straighten out the question, you would have to begin by asking yourself, “Howdo I determine what is the nature of an entity?” Before you can divideproperties of an entity into subcategories, you have to first determine what isa property. Then you can subdivide them. But you cannot say, “I willdeliberately take one group of properties and see what it will lead to logicallyif we consider exclusively those properties.” I question the start. Why do wetake exclusively those properties? If we do, we have already admitted that weare not looking at the whole picture. Then we have, in effect, edited reality,so that we are trying to define what an entity is on a partial, selective basis.Where would you properly start here? Not with fragility, because you would haveto ask yourself what literally and in reality you mean by this glass beingfragile. We say it has the property of fragility. What does that actually mean?You said it means that if you drop it on concrete, it will break. But that isn’twhat the property consists of. If you drop a metal object on concrete, it won’tbreak. Why? What is it that you know or determine about the glass as it is now,before you break it?Prof. F: It has a certain structure.AR: Yes, it has a certain molecular, chemical, or other structure which makes ita certain type of material object. That type will produce certain effects if itacts or is acted upon. So that if you drop it, it will fall to the floor andbreak. It will not float away. If you drop a feather, because of its constituentchemical, material structure, it will float; where it will land will depend onthe nature of the air currents, etc. But when you ascribe particularaction-potentials to an entity, you do so on the premise that these actions willresult because the entity, materially, physically, chemically, is of a certainkind.Prof. E: Isn’t that another way of saying the following? The so-called“dispositional property” is already a mistaken concept because all there is inactual reality is constituent properties and their effects when the entity acts.The so-called “dispositional property” is simply a package-deal term to cover acertain structure and its consequent potentialities for action.AR: Exactly.Prof. E: It simply presupposes and summarizes a causal relationship. Thereforeit would be entirely mistaken to say that an entity comprises its constituentproperties and its dispositional properties.AR: Exactly.Prof. E: Because to make that distinction will leave the constituent propertiesof a thing divorced from its potentialities for action and its potentialitiesfor action divorced from its characteristics.All there is is the constituent properties and the capacities for action. Somecombination of those is occasionally given a name in the language, but there’snot a separate property.Prof. F: Could you give me an example of a constituent property?Prof. E: Physical structure.AR: The arrangement of molecules.Prof. B: The glass is silicon dioxide, etc.Prof. F: But where you have certain physical laws about the way those moleculeswill interact, those physical laws themselves are stated in terms ofdispositional properties. Namely, if an atom of such and such atomic structureapproaches an atom of such and such other atomic structure, the following willhappen.AR: Observe: you have already said, “An atom of a certain structure, anotheratom of a different structure.” Now those are not “dispositional.”Prof. B: I think the point he is after is the following. We explain actions onthe molecular level by reference to different kinds of atoms. And when weclassify different kinds of atoms, it turns out that they have differentelectric charges. But that charge is simply a potential for action. Eventuallyyou reach the ultimate stuff, which you can identify only as the kind of thingwhich acts in this kind of way.AR: But the mistake is right here. If you go to the subatomic level, you’d haveto state, “which we at present can identify only in terms of its action becausethat’s the only way we can observe it.” But if we said, “Therefore it’s pureaction without entities,” that would be the worst mistake possible.Prof. E: So in other words, the whole idea of dispositional versusnon-dispositional properties is simply wrong.AR: It’s totally wrong. Professor F is entirely right to bring it up inconnection with my statement on causality from Galt’s speech. Because actionsare caused by entities, and therefore if you divide properties intodispositional properties vs. other properties, you’ve already denied the law ofcausality.Prof. F: But if you talk about the glass merely in terms of the macroscopiclevel, then don’t you need some concept of “dispositions”?AR: In what way? How?Prof. F: Because the glass is not acting now, it’s not breaking into pieces.Prof. E: Well, what’s wrong with the Aristotelian concept of “potentiality”? Anentity has the capacity to act because of its nature.Prof. F: Well, the reason I was bringing this up was because I thought that yourejected the concept of “potentiality.”AR: No. What made you think that? I have referred to actual and potential in anynumber of ways in any number of articles. Even if I didn’t write on this subjectdirectly, what would make you think that we reject the Aristotelian view onthis?Prof. F: All I can say is that I have memory or a misremembrance of someonesaying that Objectivism does not accept the Aristotelian concept of“potentiality.”AR: Specifically, that wasn’t me. Unless it was in some context of whatAristotle makes of it, as in regard to his form-matter dichotomy.Prof. E: Or if “potentiality” becomes the bare possibility of being something—asin his views on ultimate “prime matter.” Most of Aristotle’s usage of theconcept of “potentiality,” so far as I understand, is quite rational.Prof. F: He defines “motion” entirely in terms of potentiality, as the passagefrom potentiality to actuality. Would you agree with him there?AR: No. But that’s not disagreeing with the concept of potentiality, but onlywith its application to this particular instance.Prof. B: Would you say that what they call a “dispositional property”—fragility,combustibility, etc.—is simply naming what an entity with certain properties cando?AR: Under certain conditions, under the action of another entity.Prof. F: But most physicists deal in what they call “dispositional properties.”Prof. B: That’s just bad epistemology.AR: That’s modern epistemology.Prof. B: They don’t want to get involved with the “why,” only the “how.”Prof. E: Not even with the “what.”Prof. B: Yes, exactly.Prof. F: But now, properties are all constitutive properties, right?AR: Yes.Prof. F: In Galt’s speech you say, “A thing cannot act in contradiction to itsnature.” But that does not mean, of course, that every action which is possibleto the entity is now being realized.AR: Oh, no. I only mean that it cannot take an action which is not possible toit by its constituent nature. For instance, if you dropped that glass, itcouldn’t suddenly float. If it did—what would you do as a scientist? Suppose youtook that glass and dropped it, and suddenly you saw it going up instead ofdown. You would look for other forces operating here. You would immediately say:something is acting on that glass in a manner which is contrary to the force ofgravity. Then you have to find out what that something is. You would look fornew causes—namely, new phenomena, entities previously unknown to you whichcaused the different behavior of that glass.In other words, whenever you observe a phenomenon which seems to contradict whatyou knew before, you do not discard your knowledge, you look for newinformation—which is the process by which all science has grown.Therefore, when you say that a “dispositional property” of this glass is that itwill break, what you are really saying, if one keeps full context, is: thisglass is of a certain structure which, in the context now known to me, willbreak if it is thrown with a certain force against another entity with adifferent, harder structure. If it does something other than break, that meanssome other entity has interfered, or the action of another entity, according toits nature, has changed the result of this glass’s action but not the glass’snature. The action has changed, but the action remains within the potential foraction inherent in this glass by its nature.But if you dropped the glass, and no other force was involved, and it startedfloating, that would be an action contrary to its nature. Or if you dropped amatch into a highly inflammable substance like gasoline and it failed toexplode—Prof. E:—without some compensating factor entering—AR:—without any other factor, but suddenly nothing happened, neither to thematch nor to the gasoline, that would be the two entities acting contrary totheir nature.Prof. B: Could you put it this way? It would contradict the fact that entitieswith these properties necessarily act in certain ways under certain conditions.AR: Right. Because of the nature of a flame and the nature of gasoline, if youbring the two together there will be an explosion or the gasoline will catchfire. If you drop the same match on a piece of iron, nothing will happen exceptthat the match will burn out and the metal will be slightly heated. That’s whatI meant by that statement in Galt’s speech. [“The nature of an action is causedand determined by the nature of the entities that act; a thing cannot act incontradiction to its nature.”]Prof. F: I noticed that Gait does not say, “A thing must act in accordance withits nature”; he says it “cannot act in contradiction to its nature.” I wonder ifyou had some particular reason for stating it in the negative.AR: Oh, no, only to make it stronger actually. You could have said “must act inaccordance with its nature.” But I wanted to stress that one cannot claimcauseless actions, or actions contrary to the nature of the interactingentities. I wanted to stress that actions cannot be inexplicable and causeless.If the cause lies in the nature of an entity, then it cannot do something otherthan what its nature makes possible.PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCEPHILOSOPHIC VS. SCIENTIFIC ISSUESProf. B: Is the concept of “matter” a philosophical concept or a scientific one?AR: In the way we are using it here, as a very broad abstraction, it is aphilosophical concept. If by “matter” we mean “that of which all the things weperceive are made,” that is a philosophical concept. But questions like: whatare different things made of? what are the properties of matter? how can youbreak it down? etc.—those are scientific problems.Philosophy by its nature has to be based only on that which is available to theknowledge of any man with a normal mental equipment. Philosophy is not dependenton the discoveries of science; the reverse is true.So whenever you are in doubt about what is or is not a philosophical subject,ask yourself whether you need a specialized knowledge, beyond the knowledgeavailable to you as a normal adult, unaided by any special knowledge or specialinstruments. And if the answer is possible to you on that basis alone, you aredealing with a philosophical question. If to answer it you would need trainingin physics, or psychology, or special equipment, etc., then you are dealing witha derivative or scientific field of knowledge, not philosophy.Prof. B: I’d like to apply this to the “mind-brain” issue— that is, what is therelation of conscious activity to brain activity? That would be a scientificquestion.AR: Yes.Prof. B: With certain provisos from philosophy, such as that consciousness iscausally efficacious and that free will is possible.AR: Philosophy would have to define the terms of that question. In asking what’sthe relationship between “mind” and “brain,” scientists have to know what theymean by the two concepts. It’s philosophy that would have to tell them the[general] definitions of those concepts. But then actually to find the specificrelationship, that’s a scientific question.PROPERTIES OF THE ULTIMATE CONSTITUENTSProf. E: Could you argue, on metaphysical grounds, that all observed propertiesof an entity are ultimately explicable in terms of, or reducible back to,properties of their primary constituents?AR: We’d have to be omniscient to know. The question in my mind would be: howcan we [as philosophers] make conclusions about the ultimate constituents of theuniverse? For instance, we couldn’t say: everything is material, if by“material” we mean that of which the physical objects on the perceptual levelare made—“material” in the normal, perceptual meaning of the word. If this iswhat we mean by “material,” then we do not have the knowledge to say thatultimately everything is sub-subatomic particles which in certain aggregates arematter. Because suppose scientists discovered that there are two different kindsof primary ingredients—or three, or more? We would be in the same position asthe pre-Socratics who were trying to claim that everything was air, water,earth, and fire because that’s all they knew.Prof. E: You see the question is whether the concept of “potentiality” might notbe irreducible. That is, whether the ultimate constituents of the universe, ifand when we ever reach them, would have to be definable solely in terms of theirmode of action.AR: No, in fact the opposite will be true. The only thing of which we can besure, philosophically, is that the ultimate stuff, if it’s ever found—oneelement or ten of them—will have identity. It will be what it is. You could notsay that it is pure action: the concept wouldn’t apply. If you come down to theultimate particles of the universe and say they are pure action, they don’t haveany identity, they don’t have anything except the capacity for action—the term“action” would not apply. By “action” we mean the action of an entity.Prof. E: But suppose one were to raise the question epistemologically, ratherthan metaphysically. Granted that the ultimate constituents are something, areentities and have an identity, still is it possible for us in theory ever toknow any more about them than the kind of action they take?Prof. B: They’d have to have size, for one thing, and shape.AR: If they are particles. What if they are solid flows of energy, but each isindivisible, and it moves, but it’s one entity, moving from left to right andvice versa?Prof. B: That depends on what “energy” means, because whatever the nature ofenergy is, that’s the nature it would have.AR: Exactly.Prof. E: No, I was switching this to epistemology.AR: But the confusion there would arise in applying concepts based on themacroscopic level of observation to the submicroscopic, subatomic level. If youuse macroscopic terms which do not apply on that level, the misapplication willdestroy all your perceptual level and your whole conceptual structure.Prof. B: So you are saying that the ultimate constituents need not be particles,like solid balls, but whatever they are, one is not to refer to them as beingactions without entities.AR: Exactly. And I was also objecting to your saying they will have to haveextension, for instance, or shape. We can’t claim that.Prof. F: But suppose we agree that whatever they are, they will haveidentity—they will be what they are and so on. But mustn’t we also say somethingelse: that we cannot define this identity solely in terms of their relationshipto other objects?For instance, suppose that one of the ultimate properties of an entity ischarge. Suppose you couldn’t find any way of defining “charge” except inrelationship to other entities. Now wouldn’t that be grounds, metaphysically,for saying therefore charge is not an ultimate property of matter?AR: I am not sure I even understand the logic. Why?Prof. E: Presumably he would argue that a property which is defined in terms ofa relationship between two entities presupposes and is a consequence of theattributes of that entity which give rise to that relationship. And therefore,if charge is definable only in terms of an entity’s relation to others—itseffects on them—then charge couldn’t be a primary, it would have to be aderivative from something else in the entity that gives rise to that kind ofeffect.Prof. F: Thank you. That’s exactly what I meant.Prof. E: But then we are in bad shape here, because to grasp what the ultimateentities are, you have to strip off their actions, their potentialities foraction, and their relations to other entities—then by what means would you everget to know what they are?AR: Not only that, you are obviously making advance conditions for what thatprimary has to be. You are being Hegelian or Rationalistic in that sense. Youcannot say philosophically what conditions you will ascribe to that which is notknown. We cannot know by what means we will grasp something not known today. Ahundred years ago you couldn’t have conceived of the cloud chamber, the firstinstrument by which scientists could observe atoms simply by observing theireffects on something. You couldn’t have made the rule that unless you can touch,see, smell, and measure a given entity with a ruler, it cannot exist. That wouldhave been crude materialism of some kind. You couldn’t, a hundred years ago,have prescribed the means by which you would discover twentieth-centuryknowledge. And yet in making any kind of conclusions about the ultimate stuff ofthe universe, you are necessarily committing that error. You are prescribingconditions of what something not known to you now has to be.The important thing here is this. You cannot say that you would define an atomby means of its charge, or that you would look further, or what you would do,because you have no way of knowing in what form you will become aware of thatprimary stuff. It might be through ten different instruments, and theinteraction of one upon another, which would only tell you how you became awareof it. You wouldn’t yet have defined it, metaphysically. All you could say is,“It is a something, which I discovered by the following method.”The only thing that concerns philosophy is that we can say: whatever it is, itwill have to be what it is, and no contradictions claimed about it will bevalid—as for instance, the current theories about a particle that goes from oneplace to another without crossing the places in between. Now you see that ismetaphysically impossible, and you don’t have to be a scientist to know that. Aphilosopher can tell you without ever entering a laboratory that that is notpossible. But for a philosopher to attempt to define what kind of particle ithas to be, or how we will determine its properties, that is unwarranted andRationalistic. That is the province of science, not philosophy.You see it isn’t the job of philosophy to tell us what exists, it’s only to tellus what has to be true of everything that exists [identity] and what are therules by which you can claim knowledge. And in regard to the constituentelements of the universe, all we can say is that they would have to haveidentity. That we can prove. Any other conclusions we cannot drawphilosophically.Prof. F: So then philosophy should leave open the possibility that the ultimateproperties of things are relational properties?AR: No, because you are using a term from our present level of knowledge.“Relational properties” are what? Properties arising out of the relation of twoentities. In calling something a relational property, you are implying theexistence of entities. But now if you say the ultimate particles or elementswill be defined as relational, what does that mean? You are applying a conceptfrom our present level of knowledge to a level on which you deny it suddenly.What is a “relational property”—relation of what?Prof. F: Two ultimate elements to one another.AR: But then it isn’t a relational property.Prof. E: You’ve already made reference to the elements. AR: You made referenceto the elements. The only meaning it could possibly have is that you willobserve it only through a relationship. Let’s say that ultimately, through tensuper-microscopes, you establish that you can only observe this ultimateparticle by means of its relationship to another particle. That’s possible. Butthen you will still have implied the entity.Prof. E: Suppose it were the case that worse comes to worst epistemologically,that at the outside limit of human cognition in the indefinite future,scientists will never get beyond a knowledge of the actions of the ultimateentities—because in effect human beings’ means of cognition doesn’t encompassany means of reaching the nature of the entities, except that it is a somethingwhich has identity and acts in a certain way. Would you regard that as havingphilosophic significance, were that to be the ultimate answer?AR: No.Prof. E: Would that prove that reality in itself is unknowable to us?AR: No.Prof. E: Or that all we can know ultimately is just action?AR: No. Keep your terms defined. What are you talking about? You are talkingabout the constituents of what we, to begin with, perceive as entities. And tosay we really can perceive only action, because on the sub-subatomic level wecannot grasp the nature of those entities, we can only grasp their actions,doesn’t hold. All you are saying is: I can’t go beyond a certain level ofknowledge. That doesn’t mean that all you grasp is action.And you know what else is crucially important? When you talk about discoveringthe ultimate constituents of the universe, remember that in order to discoverthem, no matter by what calculations or by what machinery, you had to bring themto your perceptual level. You would have to say “this particle” is that whichacts in such and such a way on subatomic particles, which act in such and such away on atoms, which act in such and such a way on molecules, and all of thatresults in a material object such as this glass as distinguished from othermaterial objects such as this ashtray. Unless you bring it back to theperceptual level, it’s not knowledge. That is what has to be kept in mind alwaysin speculating about ultimate causes, which have to be discovered by some, atpresent, unknown means. You still always have to bring it back to yoursensory-perceptual level, otherwise it’s not knowledge.INDUCTIONProf. H: This is a common question relating to induction. Someone is boilingwater, and he notices that every time the water gets to a certain temperature,it boils. Now he wants to know: does all water boil at that temperature, or isit only due to some accidental feature about this particular water? How does hedetermine whether it’s accidental or essential?AR: By whether you can or cannot establish a causal connection between what youhave determined to be the essential characteristic of water and the fact that itboils at a certain temperature.Prof. H: I suppose what I’m asking is: how do you establish the causalconnection?AR: That’s a scientific question. But, in essence, what you do is this. Let’ssay you have to establish the molecular structure of water. How do thosemolecules act at a certain temperature? And if you see that something happens tothe molecules which causes boiling at a certain temperature, you conclude:that’s essential to the nature of water, adding the parenthesis: “within thepresent context of my knowledge.” You will later discover that water behavesdifferently at a different altitude. So you never claim water necessarily, as anabsolute, will always and everywhere boil at the same temperature. No, you say,“Within my present context, omitting elements of which I have no knowledge atpresent, water will always boil at a certain temperature, because boiling is astate depending on certain kind of molecular motions, and water’s molecules willalways reach that stage at a certain temperature.”Now, with later development, you might discover that maybe there are differencesin certain molecules of water when in an impure state. Or with atomic additions,say, something else happens. But then your context has changed. You don’t saythat water has changed. It’s only that your definition of how the essentialcharacteristic of water will function will have to include more: what water willdo at sea level, what it will do at higher altitudes, and what it will do undernew molecular or atomic influences, or in relation to some scientific phenomenonnot yet known to any of us. But the principle there is the same. Does thatanswer it?Prof. H: I have to think about it.AR: Okay, but ask again later, because I don’t want to leave you withsemi-answers. And that is the rational procedure : think it over, and if afurther question occurs to you, then ask me later. This applies to everybodyelse as well. If any answer is only partial, the right thing to do is to thinkit over, because one can’t discuss it and integrate it at the same time. If yousee that there is still an area not covered, then ask me later.Prof. A: How would you answer this common objection to your answer? In relatingthe boiling of water to the energy required to break certain molecular bonds,you haven’t actually made any progress in regard to the induction, becauseyou’ve only got the same kind of generalization on the molecular level that youhad before on the gross, macroscopic level. You now know, “In a given number ofcases, it has always taken a certain amount of energy to break this molecularbond.” But that fact has the same sort of status as the fact you started with:“In a given number of cases, I heated the water to 212 degrees, and it alwaysboiled.” I know the objection is crazy, because in some way you do have moreknowledge when you’ve gone down to the molecular level. But I can’t see what theerror is.AR: But you see, you answered it. When you simply boil water, you do not knowthat it has molecules, nor what happens to those molecules. When you arrive atthat later stage of knowledge, you’ve discovered something about water and theconditions of its boiling which you didn’t know before. And, therefore, withinyour present context, this is a sufficient explanation, even though it’s not theexclusive and final explanation. To reach that you would have to haveomniscience. But, if you can say, “It’s in the nature of water that it’scomposed of molecules, and something happens to those molecules at a certaintemperature, this explains to me why water boils,” that is a causal explanation.It isn’t the same thing as saying, “I don’t know why it boils, but if I heat it,it bubbles up.” That’s all that you knew before. And, therefore, your knowledgeis now further advanced.Prof. A: But it seems that the certainty that you were first trying to attach tothe idea that water boils under certain conditions is derivative from the degreeof certainty you have concerning the idea that a certain amount of energydisrupts the molecules.AR: If this is supposed to be on the same level, what would the person raisingthis objection consider to be a different level?Prof. A: Yes, that’s exactly the problem.AR: That’s not the problem. No. That’s the method of ruling his objection out.Because you discover that he has no ground for his conclusion that you’re on thesame level. Look at the facts. You observe that water boils. You discoversomething in the constituent elements of water that causes it. You know morethan you did before. But he tells you, “No, you’re at the same place.” Then youask him, “What place do you want to go to? What do you regard as knowledge?”Prof. E: And then his answer would be that he wants a mystic apprehension of“necessity,” which he hasn’t yet received. All he has is “contingent” facts.AR: Yes. And you ask him what does he regard the facts of reality as: anecessity or a contingency? He’ll say, “Of course it’s a contingency, becauseGod made it this way, and he could have made it another.” And you say,“Good-bye.”Prof. F: But I am not clear why it is a significant step when one goes from themacroscopic phenomenon, boiling, to the molecular level. Why does one then say,“Aha! Now, within our present context of knowledge, we’ve made a satisfactoryadvance.”AR: Let’s ask something wider: what is knowledge? And what is study, what isobservation? It’s the discovery of properties in the nature of certain objects,existents, entities. All knowledge consists of learning more and more about thenature—the properties and characteristics—of given objects. So first you seeonly water—just that. Then you observe that it boils at a certain point. Yourknowledge is advanced. You know more about water than you did when you onlyobserved it in a lake. Then you discover such a thing as molecules, then youdiscover the molecular structure of water. Your knowledge about what water is isstill greater. Now you observe what happens to those molecules when you apply acertain amount of energy. Your knowledge is still greater. If it isn’t, what doyou mean by knowledge?Prof. F: Both you and your positivist opponents would agree that the knowledgeis greater. But they would then raise the question of whether one has to go afurther step or not—or why one should have made this step in the first place.Why does the breaking of the macroscopic down into the molecular constitute asignificant step, whereas the addition of some other type of knowledge—AR: Such as?Prof. F: Such as the knowledge of, say, the shape of the water at present, orthe electrical charges involved.AR: All that is knowledge. The knowledge of anything that can happen towater—what temperature it will freeze at, how it reflects light—anycharacteristic of a given object of study is knowledge. If you can establishthat this characteristic pertains to water, you have learned something new aboutwater.But if the problem here involves the issue of necessity vs. contingency, thenit’s a prescientific problem, a strictly philosophical problem. What do you meanby “necessity”? By “necessity,” we mean that things are a certain way and had tobe. I would maintain that the statement “Things are,” when referring tonon-man-made occurrences, is the synonym of “They had to be.” Because unless westart with the premise of an arbitrary God who creates nature, what is had tobe. We have to drop any mystical premise and keep the full context in mind.Then, aside from human action, what things are is what they had to be.The alternative of what “had to be” versus what “didn’t have to be” doesn’tapply metaphysically. It applies only to the realm of human action and humanchoice. For instance, will you wear a gray suit or a blue suit? That’s up toyou. You didn’t have to wear either one. Let’s assume you have only one suit.Even then you can’t say you had to wear it. You chose to wear it rather than benaked. Anything pertaining to actions open to human choice raises the question:“Is it necessary or is it volitional?” But in regard to facts which aremetaphysical—that is, not created by a human action—there is no such thing asnecessity—or, the fact of existence is the necessity.Prof. A: I think that was exactly my problem. I was assuming that the fact thata certain entity had always done a certain thing had no significance initself—that it could be otherwise tomorrow. But actually, something would actdifferently tomorrow only if a new factor entered in.AR: Yes.Prof. A: And by going to the molecular level, you tend to exclude any newfactor; you have more awareness of the mechanism operating, so you have moreknowledge of what is going to affect it and what isn’t; you understand what theprocess is that’s happening. I was assuming exactly what you were saying, thatthe fact that the energy required was so-and-so today, might change tomorrow,because of God knows what. So the answer lies in the point that necessity isjust identity.AR: Exactly.Prof. C: On this issue of boiling water and finding out that it must boilbecause of understanding its molecular structure: isn’t it related in some wayto the issue of unit-economy in concepts? Because in theory-formation oneattempts to condense a vast amount of knowledge into a smaller and smallernumber of principles. And when one is able to explain the boiling of water interms of the electrons and protons, not only does one explain boiling asnecessary from these few facts, but also one explains a vast number of othercharacteristics, properties, and set of behaviors for water and a whole scad ofother substances.AR: Oh yes.Prof. C: So when you go to that level, you have widened your knowledge to a muchlarger scope by integrating the data to a few simple laws, such as, in thiscase, the properties of the electrons.AR: You mean, it is also applicable to more than water, and if you discover howthe molecules of water react to heat, you then open the way to discoveriesconcerning how other elements react to heat, and you learn a great deal aboutother elements that way.Prof. C: Right.AR: Oh, of course.Prof. C: So the objection of the logical positivist would be valid only if onelearned nothing else relating water at the molecular level to other substances.Then one would say one has additional knowledge, but one doesn’t have a morefundamental knowledge.AR: No, the objection wouldn’t be valid even then. To begin with, thesupposition is impossible. Everything that you discover about one kind ofsubject or element opens the way for the same type of inquiry and discoveryabout other elements.But let’s assume for a moment that it had no other applications. Even then, youlearn something about water and how to handle it and what you can obtain fromit. If you discover that its molecules move in a certain way and that causesboiling, this can lead you to discover other things you can do with water, suchas what happens under a deep freeze or what happens with liquid oxygen—which isall derived from the same type of knowledge, from the same category of science.And don’t forget—it is important here—what the purpose of knowledge is. Thepurpose is for you to deal with that which you are studying. And if you discoverwhy water boils, you will know something more and will be able to do more thingswith water than the primitive man who knows only that if he holds it over fire acertain length of time it will boil. By discovering such issues as temperatureand molecular structure, you have made yourself infinitely more capable ofdealing with water and using it for your purposes than the primitive man whoonly made the first observation.SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGYProf. M: Would you consider the following method of confirming a scientificprinciple to be valid? One formulates the principle being guided by one’sknowledge of fact. Using the principle, one next deduces how entities undercertain conditions should act. Then, if one observes such action and, within thecontext of one’s knowledge can account for it only by the principle whichpredicted it, it follows that the principle has been confirmed. In summary, oneinduces the principle, deduces its consequences, and if only that principle isknown to give rise to those consequences, which in turn exist, then theprinciple is confirmed as a contextual absolute.AR: This is outside the province of my book; this is the theory of induction.But within this context, I would say, no, this would not be the right procedure,and there is a danger of a very, very grave error here. Because if you followthe procedure you outline here, and you make certain predictions on the basis ofa hypothesis, and the entities do act accordingly, you conclude that you canhold as a contextual absolute that it was your hypothesis that was operating andthat it is therefore true. You are assuming an omniscience that contextualknowledge cannot permit. Because since you are not omniscient, within thecontext of your knowledge you cannot say that your particular hypothesis was theonly possible cause of the entities acting the way you predicted. You would haveto say this offers great confirmation of your hypothesis, but it still remains ahypothesis and cannot be taken as knowledge. Why? Because so many otherpossibilities are involved. And I don’t mean unknown or unknowable factors—Imean that it would be impossible, for any complex principle of science that youare trying to establish, to eliminate, even within your own context ofknowledge, all the other possibilities.What I would question is this part of the procedure: “if only that principle isknown to give rise to those consequences” —that’s the mistake of arrestedknowledge, right there.Prof. M: Even though it is relative to what you know at that time?AR: Even though it’s at that time and it’s your full context of knowledge.Because you cannot conclude that something which is not fully known to you canbe produced only by one hypothesized factor. On the basis of that same contextof knowledge, any number of hypotheses could be constructed. Which is why weneed hypotheses. If it were otherwise, then your hypothesis to begin with wouldalmost have to be a certainty.Historically, some dreadful errors have resulted from that method. One of themis the denial of the existence of ether. I don’t mean that ether necessarilyexists; I mean the process by which they denied it, was of this type. Theypredicted something with an artificial absolute or ultimatum delivered tonature—if light bends in a certain way (or something on that order), then itproves that space is a vacuum. It certainly does not, and I am no physicist, Iam just an epistemologist. You cannot arbitrarily restrict the facts of natureto your current level of knowledge. In other words, you cannot take the contextof your knowledge, as if reality were confined only to that which you know, anddeliver ultimatums, saying, “If my hypothesis predicts correctly, then it isonly my hypothesis that can be true.”Prof. M: Take the example of Newton’s theory of universal gravitation. He saidthat if the theory is true, then the planets will exhibit elliptical orbits withthe sun at one of the foci. Now it is found in astronomy that the planets dofollow that path. So what can one say then about Newton’s theory? Is it apossible explanation? Is it correct, or what?AR: After it has been verified by a great many other observations, not merelythe verification of one prediction, then at a certain time one can accept it asa fact. But taking your example as an illustration of what you are asking, ifthe sole validation for Newton’s principle was that it predicted that orbitswill be elliptical, and then we observed that they are elliptical—that wouldn’tbe sufficient proof. Epistemologically, it wouldn’t be enough. You would have tohave other observations, from different aspects of the same issue, which allsupport this hypothesis. [Historically, Newton validated his theory by means ofa great many observations of widely differing phenomena.]Prof. M: The question is: when does one stop? When does one decide that enoughconfirming evidence exists? Is that in the province of the issue of induction?AR: Yes. That’s the big question of induction. Which I couldn’t begin todiscuss—because (a) I haven’t worked on that subject enough to even begin toformulate it, and (b) it would take an accomplished scientist in a given fieldto illustrate the whole process in that field.027 [rand_9781101137208_oeb_027_r1.jpg]Prof. C: Some mathematicians claim that there is such a thing as an “imaginarynumber.” How do you determine whether it is correct or not to include imaginarynumbers within the same category as real numbers?AR: By defining the essential characteristics of the units. After you definewhat a real number is and what an imaginary number is, if you see from what youmean by those terms that there are essential differences, then you can’t includethem in the same concept.But this is really a question concerning theory-formation, notconcept-formation. You are in the realm of epistemology of science. I will justsay on this topic that you have to treat scientific concepts in exactly the sameway, in principle, as you treat “table” and “chair.” If somebody decided to puttables and chairs into one concept—on the grounds that you always see themtogether—but beds and automobiles in another because he can lie down in either,you would object to that. Why? Because you would say that he has organized hisdata by non-essentials. He has ignored essential similarities and essentialdifferences and arbitrarily coupled certain existents into certain groups. Thaterror comes under the general category of definition by non-essentials. It isdisastrous conceptually to try to integrate objects by non-essentialcharacteristics.Exactly the same thing, in principle, would apply to a scientific theory.Suppose somebody tries to couple neutrons and pancakes. The same objectionapplies. If you ask him to define what he means by “neutron” and what he meansby “pancake,” you will find volumes of differences that do not permit them to begrouped into one concept.Prof. C: An imaginary number is supposed to be that number which when multipliedby itself is equal to minus one. There is, in fact, no real number which whenmultiplied by itself gives you minus one.AR: What is its purpose?Prof. C: It turns out that it has a great usefulness as a device mathematicallyfor solving problems of a real kind—for instance, problems involving electricalcircuits. But I personally do not see the validity of this concept. There isnothing in reality to which it corresponds. Nothing is measured except by realnumbers.AR: But here there is a certain contradiction in your theoretical presentation.If you say that these imaginary numbers do serve a certain function inmeasurement, then—Prof. C: Excuse me, not in measurements of anything, but in computation—insolving an equation.AR: The main question is: do they really serve that purpose?Prof. C: In practice, yes.AR: If they serve that purpose, then they have a valid meaning—only then theyare not concepts of entities, they are concepts of method. If they have a usewhich you can apply to actual reality, but they do not correspond to any actualnumbers, it is clearly a concept pertaining to method. It is an epistemologicaldevice to establish certain relationships. But then it has validity. Allconcepts of this kind are concepts of method and have to be clearlydifferentiated as such.Whenever in doubt, incidentally, about the standing of any concept, you can dowhat I have done in this discussion right now. I asked you, “What, in reality,does that concept refer to?” If you tell me that the concept, let’s say, of animaginary number doesn’t do anything in reality, but somebody builds a theory onit, then I would say it is an invalid concept. But if you tell me, yes, thisparticular concept, although it doesn’t correspond to anything real, doesachieve certain ends in computations, then clearly you can classify it: it is aconcept of method, and it acquires meaning only in the context of a certainprocess of computation.Therefore, when in doubt about the classification or nature of a concept, alwaysrefer ultimately to reality. What in reality gives rise to that concept? Does itcorrespond to anything real? Does it achieve anything real? Or is it justsomebody’s arbitrary theory?You see, the danger here is the method of saying, “What if?” That is a verywidely held and disastrous error today—not only in mathematics but in everyscience. And, of course, philosophy is the author of that error. I mean the ideathat it is legitimate to form arbitrary hypotheses. Never try to justify or totie to reality—or to negate for that matter—some hypothesis, or some “What if?”proposition for which there is no basis at all. That is the dead end of humanepistemology, and worse than that. That is a mind-destroyer.Prof. C: On the preceding point, how would I answer the charge that I am nowaccepting the validity of imaginary numbers on merely pragmatic grounds—that is,just because “it works.”AR: Yes, but if it works, it is your job as a scientist to find out why itworks. If something works you want to know the reason why. For instance, thereare cases where people used certain things, such as potions in medicine, whichworked—only they didn’t know why. That’s not science yet; that is a stage ofpre-science or of pragmatic observations. But you don’t dismiss them. If theywork, you inquire why. But only after you have established why they work doesthis kind of inquiry enter the realm of science or of philosophy.CONCLUDING HISTORICAL POSTSCRIPTProf. B: You said you might discuss how you arrived at your theory ofmeasurement-omission. That might be a fitting way to close.AR: All right. Historically, it happened this way. Somewhere in the 1940s, soit’s over twenty years ago, I was discussing the issue of concepts with aJesuit, who philosophically was a Thomist. He was holding to the Aristotelianposition that concepts refer to an essence in concretes. And he specificallyreferred to “manness” in man and “roseness” in roses. I was arguing with himthat there is no such thing, and that these names refer merely to anorganization of concretes, that this is our way of organizing concretes.We never really finished the argument. But after this conversation, I wasdissatisfied with my own answer. Because I felt, “Yes, I have indicated whereconcepts come from, but I haven’t indicated what is the process by which weorganize concretes into different groups—because I certainly don’t agree withthe modern nominalists who claim that it’s an arbitrary convention or anarbitrary grouping.”And then I asked myself, “What is it that my mind does when I use concepts? Towhat do I refer, and how do I learn new concepts?” And within half an hour, Ihad the answer.Now it took me longer than that to check it, to apply it to various categoriesof concepts, and see if there are exceptions. But once I had the answer, by thelogic of it, I knew that that’s it. And that’s it."},{"pageContent":"INDEXPrepared by Linda Reardan, Department of Philosophy California State University,San BernardinoAAbstractionfrom abstractions; cognitive content of ; and hierarchy ; measurement-omissionin; and similarity; units ofSee also Hierarchy of concepts; Measurement-omissionAction, concepts of See also Casuality; MotionAdjectivesAdverbsAnalytic-synthetic dichotomyconsequences ofand Kantand meaningroots ofSee also Logical-empirical dichotomy; Necessary-contingent dichotomyAnimals, awareness ofAnti-concepts.
