It contains the main philosophical passages from my novels and presents the ou tline of a new philosophical system. The full system is implicit in thes e excerpts (particularly in Galt’s speech), but its fundamentals are indi cated only in the widest terms and require a detailed, system atic presentation in a philosophical treatise. I am working on such a treatis e at present; it will deal predominantly with the issue which is barely touched upon in Galt’s speech: epistemology, and will present a new theory of the nature, source and valid ation of concepts. This work will require several years; until th en, I offer the present book as a lead or a summary for those who wish to acqui re an integrated view of existence. They may regard it as a basic outline ; it will give them the guidance they need, but only if they think through and understand the exact meaning and the full implications of these excerpts. I am often asked whether I am prim arily a novelist or a philosopher. The answer is: both. In a certain sense, every novelist is a philosopher, because one cannot present a picture of human existence without a philosophical framework; the novelist’s only choice is whether that framework is present in his story explicitly or implicitly, whet her he is aware of it or not, whether he holds his philosophical convictions consciously or subconsciously. This involves another choice: whether his work is his individual projection of existing philosophical ideas or whethe r he originates a philosophical framework of his own. I did the second. That is not the specific task of a novelist; I had to do it, becau se my basic view of ma n and of existence was in conflict with most of the existi ng philosophical theories. In order to define, explain and present my con cept of man, I had to become a philosopher in the specific meaning of the term. For those who may be interested in the chronological development of my thinking, I have included excerpts fro m all four of my novels. They may observe the progression from a political theme in We the Living to a metaphysical theme in Atlas Shrugged . These excerpts are necessarily c ondensed summaries, because the full statement of the subjects involved is pr esented, in each novel, by means of the events of the story. The events are the concrete s and the particulars, of which the speeches are th e abstract summations."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 6 When I say that these excerpts are me rely an outline, I do not mean to imply that my full system is still to be defined or discovered; I had to define it before I could start writing Atlas Shrugged . Galt’s speech is its briefest summary. Until I complete the presentation of my philosophy in a fully detailed form, this present book may serve as an outline or a program or a manifesto. For reasons which are made clear in the following pages, the name I have chosen for my philosophy is Objectivism .

America, at present, is following the first course. The gray-ness, the stale cynicism, the noncommittal cautiousne ss, the guilty evasiveness of our public voices suggest the attitude of the courtiers in the story “The Emperor’s New Clothes” who profe ssed admiration for the Emperor’s non- existent garments, having accepted the assertion that a nyone who failed to perceive them was morally depraved at heart. Let me be the child in the story and declare that the Emperor is naked—or that America is culturally bankrupt. In any given period of history, a cu lture is to be judged by its dominant philosophy, by the prevalent trend of it s intellectual life as expressed in morality, in politics, in economics, in art. Professional intellectuals are the voice of a culture and are, therefore, its leaders, its integrators and its bodyguards. America’s intellectual leadersh ip has collapsed. Her virtues, her values, her enormous power are scat tered in a silent underground and will remain private, subjective, historically impotent if left without intellectual expression. America is a country wit hout voice or defense—a country sold out and abandoned by he r intellectual bodyguards. Bankruptcy is defined as the state of being at the end of one’s resources. What are the intellectual values or re sources offered to us by the present guardians of our culture? In philosophy, we are taught that man’s mind is impotent, that reality is unknowable, that knowledge is an illusion, and reason a superstition. In psychology, we are told that man is a helpless automaton, determined by forces be yond his control, motivated by innate depravity. In literature, we are shown a line-up of murderers, dipsomaniacs, drug addicts, neurotics and psychotics as representatives of man’s soul—and are invited to identify our own among them—with the belligerent assertions that life is a sewer, a foxhole or a rat race, with the whining injunctions that we must love everything, except vi rtue, and forgive everything, except greatness. In politics, we are told that America, the great est, noblest, freest"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 8 country on earth, is politically and mora lly inferior to Soviet Russia, the bloodiest dictatorship in history—and that our wealth s hould be given away to the savages of Asia and Africa, with apologies for the fact that we have produced it while they haven’t. If we look at modern intellectuals, we are confronted with the grotesque spectacle of such characteristics as militant uncertainty, crusading cynicism, dogmatic agnosticism, boastful self- abasement and self-righteous depravity—in an atmosphe re of guilt, of panic, of despair, of boredom and of all-pervasive evasion. If this is not the state of being at the end of one’s resources , there is no further place to go. Everybody seems to agree that civilizat ion is facing a crisis, but nobody cares to define its nature, to di scover its cause and to assume the responsibility of formulating a solutio n. In times of danger, a morally healthy culture rallies its values, its self-esteem and its crusading spirit to fight for its moral ideals with full, right eous confidence. But this is not what we see today. If we ask our intellectual leaders what are the ideals we should fight for, their answer is such a sticky puddle of stale syrup—of benevolent bromides and apologetic generalities a bout brother love, global progress and universal prosperity at America’s expense—that a fly would not die for it or in it. One of America’s tragic errors is that too many of her best minds believe—as they did in the past—that the solution is to turn anti-intellectual and rely on some cracker-barrel sort of folksy wisdom. The exact opposite is true. What we need most urgently is to recognize the enormous power and the crucial importance of the intellectua l professions. A culture cannot exist without a constant stream of ideas and the alert, independent minds who originate them; it cannot exist without a philosophy of life, without those who formulate it and express it. A coun try without intellectuals is like a body without a head. And that is precisely the position of America today. Our present state of cultural disintegration is not maintained and prolonged by intellectuals as such, but by the fact that we haven’t any. The majority of those who posture as intellectuals toda y are frightened zombies, posturing in a vacuum of their own making, who adm it their abdication from the realm of the intellect by embracing such doctrines as Existentialism and Zen Buddhism. After decades of preaching that the hallm ark of an intellectual consists of proclaiming the impotence of the inte llect, these modern zombies are left aghast before the fact that they ha ve succeeded—that they are impotent to ignite the lights of civilization, which they have extinguished—that they are impotent to halt the triumphant advance of the primordial brute, whom they have released—that they ha ve no answer to give to those voices out of the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 9 Dark Ages who gloat that reason and freedom have had their chance and have failed, and that the future, like the long night of the past, belongs once more to faith and force . If all the manufacturers of railroad engines suddenly went irrational and began to manufacture covered wagons instead, nobody would accept the claim that this is a progressive innova tion or that the iron horse has failed; and many men would step into the indus trial vacuum to start manufacturing railroad engines. But when this happens in philoso phy—when we are offered Zen Buddhism and its equivalents as the latest word in human thought—nobody, so far, has chosen to step into the intellectual vacuum to carry on the work of man’s mind. Thus our great industrial civilizati on is now expected to run railroads, airlines, intercontinental missiles and H- bomb stock piles by the guidance of philosophical doctrines created by and for barefoot sava ges who lived in mudholes, scratched the soil for a handful of grain and gave thanks to the statues of distorted animals whom th ey worshipped as superior to man. Historically, the professional intellect ual is a very recent phenomenon: he dates only from the industrial revolu tion. There are no professional intellectuals in primitive, savage so cieties, there are only witch doctors. There were no professional intellectuals in the Middle Ages, there were only monks in monasteries. In the post-Ren aissance era, prior to the birth of capitalism, the men of the intellect—t he philosophers, the teachers, the writers, the early scientists—were men w ithout a profession, that is: without a socially recognized position, without a market, without a means of earning a livelihood. Intellectual pursuits had to depend on the accident of inherited wealth or on the favor and financial support of some wealthy protector. And wealth was not earned on an open mark et, either; wealth was acquired by conquest, by force, by political power, or by the favor of those who held political power. Tradesmen were mo re vulnerably and precariously dependent on favor than the intellectuals. The professional businessman and the professional Intellectual came into existence together, as brothers born of the industrial revolution. Both are the sons of capitalism—and if they perish, they will perish together. The tragic irony will be that they will have destr oyed each other; and the major share of the guilt will belong to the intellectual. With very rare and brief exceptio ns, pre-capitalist societies had no place for the creative power of man’s mind, ne ither in the creation of ideas nor in the creation of wealth. Reason and its practical expression—free trade— were forbidden as a sin and a crime, or were tolerated, usually as ignoble activities, under the control of authoritie s who could revoke the tolerance at"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 10 whim. Such societies were ruled by faith and its practical expression: force. There were no makers of knowledge an d no makers of wealth; there were only witch doctors and tribal chiefs. These two figures dominate every anti- rational period of history, whether one calls them tribal chief and witch doctor—or absolute monarc h and religious leader—or dictator and logical positivist. “The tragic joke of human hist ory”—I am quoting Join Galt in Atlas Shrugged —“is that on any of the altars men erected, it was always man whom they immolated and the animal w hom they enshrined. It was always the animal’s attributes, not man’s, th at humanity worshipped: the idol of instinct and the idol of force—the my stics and the kings—the mystics, who longed for an irresponsible consciousness and ruled by means of the claim that their dark emotions were superi or to reason, that knowledge came in blind, causeless fits, blindly to be followed, not doubted—and the kings, who ruled by means of claws and musc les, with conquest as their method and looting as their aim, with a club or a gun as sole sanction of their power. The defenders of man’s soul were c oncerned with his feelings, and the defenders of man’s body were concerne d with his stomach—but both were united against his mind.” These two figures—the man of fa ith and the man of force—are philosophical archetypes, psychological symbols and historical reality. As philosophical archetypes, they embody two variants of a certain view of man and of existence. As psychological symbols, they represent the basic motivation of a great many men who exist in any era, culture or society. As historical reality, they are the actual ru lers of most of mankind’s societies, who rise to power whenever men abandon reason. 1 The essential characteristics of thes e two remain the same in all ages: Attila , the man who rules by brute force, acts on the range of the moment, is concerned with nothing but the physical reality immediately before him, respects nothing but man’s muscles, and regards a fist, a club or a gun as the only answer to any problem—and the Witch Doctor , the man who dreads physical reality, dreads the necessity of practical action, and escapes into his emotions, into visions of some myst ic realm where his wishes enjoy a supernatural power unlimited by the absolute of nature. Superficially, these two may appear to be opposites, but observe what they have in common: a consciousness held down to the perceptual method of functioning, an awareness that does Hot choose to extend beyond the  1 I am indebted to Nathaniel Branden for many valuable observations on this subject and for his eloquent designation of the two archetypes, which I shall use hereafter: Attila and the Witch Doctor ."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 11 automatic, the immediate, the given, the involuntary, which means: an animal’s “epistemology” or as near to it as a human consciousness can come. Man’s consciousness shares with animals the first two stages of its development: sensations and percep tions; but it is the third state, conceptions , that makes him man. Sensations are integrated into perceptions automatically, by the brain of a man or of an animal. But to integrate perceptions into conceptions by a proce ss of abstraction, is a feat that man alone has the power to perfor m—and he has to perform it by choice . The process of abstraction, a nd of concept-formation is a process of reason, of thought ; it is not automatic nor instinctiv e nor involuntary nor infallible. Man has to initiate it, to sustain it a nd to bear responsibility for its results. The pre-conceptual level of consci ousness is nonvolitiona l; volition begins with the first syllogism. Man has th e choice to think or to evade—to maintain a state of full awareness or to drift from moment to moment, in a semi-conscious daze, at the mercy of whatever associational whims the unfocused mechanism of his consciousness produces. But the living organisms that possess th e faculty of consciousness need to exercise it in order to survive. An animal’s consciousness functions automatically; an animal perceives what it is able to perceive and survives accordingly, no further than the percep tual level permits and no better. Man cannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses do not provide him with an automatic gui dance, they do not give him the knowledge he needs, only the material of knowledge, which his mind has to integrate. Man is the only living species who has to perceive reality—which means: to be conscious —by choice. But he shares with other species the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. For an animal, the question of survival is primarily physical; fo r man, primarily epistemological. Man’s unique reward, however, is that while animals survive by adjusting themselves to their background, man survives by adjusting his background to himself. If a drought strikes them, animals perish—man builds irrigation canals; if a flood strikes them, animals perish—man builds dams; if a carnivorous pack attacks them animal s perish—man writes the Constitution of the United States. But one does not obtain food, safe ty or freedom—by instinct. It is against this faculty, the faculty of reason , that Attila and the Witch Doctor rebel. The key to both their souls is their longing for the effortless, irresponsible, automatic consciousne ss of an animal. Both dread the necessity, the risk and the responsibility of rational cognition. Both dread the fact that “nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.” Both seek to exist, not"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 12 by conquering nature, but by adjusting to the given, the immediate, the known. There is only one means of surv ival for those who do not choose to conquer nature: to conquer those who do. The physical conquest of men is Attila’s me thod of survival. He regards men as others regard fruit trees or farm animals: as objects in nature, his for the seizing. But while a good farmer knows, at least, that fruit trees and animals have a specific nature and re quire a specific kind of handling, the perceptual mentality of Attila does not extend to so abstract a level: men, to him, are a natural phenomenon and an irreducible primary, as all natural phenomena are irreducible primaries to an animal. Attila feels no need to understand, to explain, nor even to wonder, how men manage to produce the things he covets—“ somehow ” is a fully satisfactory answer inside his skull, which refuses to consider such ques tions as “how?” and “why?” or such concepts as identity and causality. All he needs, his “urges” tell him, is bigger muscles, bigger clubs or a bigger gang than theirs in order to seize their bodies and their products, af ter which their bodies will obey his commands and will provide him, some how, with the satisfaction of any whim. He approaches men as a beast of prey, and the consequences of his actions or the possibilit y of exhausting his vict ims never enters his consciousness, which does not choose to extend beyond the given moment. His view of the universe does not include the power of production. The power of destruction, of brute force, is, to him, metaphysically omnipotent. An Attila never thinks of creating, only of taking over . Whether he conquers a neighboring tribe or overruns a continent, material looting is his only goal and it ends with the act of seizure: he has no other purpose, no plan, no system to impose on the conq uered, no values. His pleasures are closer to the level of sensations than of perceptions: f ood, drink, palatial shelter, rich clothing, indiscriminate sex, contests of physical prowess, gambling—all those activities which do not demand or involve the use of the conceptual level of consciousness. He does not originate his pleasures: he desires and pursues whatever those around him seem to find desirable. Even in the realm of desires, he does not create, he me rely takes over. But a human being cannot live his life moment by moment; a human consciousness preserves a certain contin uity and demands a certain degree of integration, whether a man seeks it or not. A human being needs a frame of reference, a comprehensive view of existence, no matter how rudimentary, and, since his consciousness is volitional, a sense of being right , a moral justification of his actions, which m eans: a philosophical code of values. Who, then, provides Attila with values? The Witch Doctor."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 13 If Attila’s method of survival is the conquest of those who conquer nature, the Witch Doctor’s method of survival is safer, he believe s, and spares him the risks of physical conflict. His method is the conquest of those who conquer those who conque r nature. It is not men’s bodies that he seeks to rule, but men’s souls. To Attila, as to an animal, the pheno mena of nature are an irreducible primary. To the Witch Doctor, as to an animal, the irreducible primary is the automatic phenomena of his own consciousness. An animal has no critical faculty; he has no control ove r the function of his brain and no power to question its content. To an animal, whatever strikes his awareness is an absolute that corresponds to reality—or rather, it is a distinction he is incapable of ma king: reality, to him, is whatever he senses or feels. And this is the Witch Doctor’s epistemological ideal, the mode of consciousness he strives to in duce in himself. To the Witch Doctor, emotions are tools of cognition, and wishes take precedence over facts. He seeks to escape the risks of a que st for knowledge by obliterating the distinction between consciousness and re ality, between the perceiver and the perceived, hoping that an automatic ce rtainty and an infallible knowledge of the universe will be granted to him by the blind, unfo cused stare of his eyes turned inward, contemplating the sens ations, the feelings, the urgings, the muggy associational twistings projected by the rudderless mechanism of his undirected consciousness. Whatever his mechanism produces is an absolute not to be questioned; and whenever it clas hes with reality, it is reality that he ignores. Since the clash is constant, the Witch Doctor’s solution is to believe that what he perceives is another, “hig her” reality—where his wishes are omnipotent, where contradictions ar e possible and A is non-A, where his assertions, which are false on earth, beco me true and acquire the status of a “superior” truth which he perceives by means of a special faculty denied to other, “inferior,” beings. The only va lidation of his consciousness he can obtain on earth is the belief and the obedience of others, when they accept his “truth” as superior to their own pe rception of reality. While Attila extorts their obedience by means of a club, the Witch Doctor obtains it by means of a much more powerful weapon: he pre-empts the field of morality . There is no way to turn morality in to a weapon of enslavement except by divorcing it from man’s reason and from the goals of his own existence. There is no way to degrade man’s life on earth except by the lethal opposition of the moral and the practical . Morality is a code of values to guide man’s choices and actions; when it is set to oppose his own life and mind, it makes him turn against himself and blindly act as the tool of his"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 14 own destruction. There is no way to ma ke a human being accept the role of a sacrificial animal except by destroying hi s self-esteem. There is no way to destroy his self-esteem except by maki ng him reject his own consciousness. There is no way to make him rej ect his own consciousness except by convincing him of its impotence. The damnation of this earth as a r ealm where nothing is possible to man but pain, disaster and defeat, a realm in ferior to another, “higher,” reality; the damnation of all values, enjoyment, achievement and success on earth as a proof of depravity; the damnati on of man’s mind as a source of pride , and the damnation of reason as a “limited, ” deceptive, unreliable, impotent faculty, incapable of perceiving the “r eal” reality and the “true” truth; the split of man in two, setting his conscious ness (his soul) against his body, and his moral values against his own inte rest; the damnation of man’s nature, body and self as evil; the commandment of self-sacrifice, renunciation, suffering, obedience, humility and faith, as the good; the damnation of life and the worship of death, with th e promise of rewards beyond the grave— these are the necessary tenets of the Witc h Doctor’s view of existence, as they have been in every variant of Witch Doctor philosophy throughout the course of mankind’s history. The secret of the Witch Do ctor’s power lies in the fact that man needs an integrated view of life, a philosophy , whether he is aware of his need or not—and whenever, through ignorance, cowardice or mental sloth, men choose not to be aware of it, their ch ronic sense of guilt, uncertainty and terror makes them feel that the W itch Doctor’s philosophy is true. The first to feel it is Attila. The man who lives by brute force, at the whim and mercy of the moment, lives on a narrow island suspended in a fog of the unknown, where invisible threats and unpredictable disasters can descend upon him any morning. He is willing to surrender his c onsciousness to the man w ho offers him protection against those intangible questions whic h he does not wish to consider, yet dreads. Attila’s fear of reality is as great as the Witch Doctor’s. Both hold their consciousness on a subhuman level a nd method of functioning: Attila’s brain is a jumble of concretes uni ntegrated by abstractions; the Witch Doctor’s brain is a miasma of floating abstractions unrelated to concretes. Both are guided and motivated—ultimately—not by thoughts, but by feelings and whims. Both cling to th eir whims as to their only certainty. Both feel secretly inadequate to th e task of dealing with existence. Thus they come to need each other. Attila feels that th e Witch Doctor can give him what he lacks: a long-range view, an insurance against the dark"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 15 unknown of tomorrow or next week or ne xt year, a code of moral values to sanction his actions and to disarm his victims. The Witch Doctor feels that Attila can give him the material mean s of survival, can protect him from physical reality, can spare him the nece ssity of practical action, and can enforce his mystic edicts on any recal citrant who may choose to challenge his authority. Both of them are incomp lete parts of a human being, who seek completion in each other: the man of muscle and the man of feelings, seeking to exist without mind . Since no man can fully escape the concep tual level of c onsciousness, it is not the case that Attila and the Witch Do ctor cannot or do not think; they can and do—but thinking, to them, is not a means of perceiving reality, it is a means of justifying their escape from the necessity of rational perception. Reason, to them, is a means of defea ting their victims, a menial servant charged with the task of rationalizing the metaphysical validity and power of their whims. Just as a bank robber will spend years of planning, ingenuity and effort in order to prove to himself that he can exist without effort, so both Attila and the Witch Doctor w ill go to any length of cunning, calculation and thought in order to demonstrate the impotence of thought and preserve the image of a pliable uni verse where miracles are possible and whims are efficacious. The power of ideas has no reality for either of them, and neither cares to learn that the proo f of that power lies in his own chronic sense of guilt and terror. Thus Attila and the Witch Doctor fo rm an alliance and divide their respective domains. Attila rules the r ealm of men’s physical existence—the Witch Doctor rules the realm of men’ s consciousness. Attila herds men into armies—the Witch Doctor sets the armies’ goals. Attila conquers empires— the Witch Doctor writes their laws. Attila loots and plunders—the Witch Doctor exhorts the victims to surpass their selfish concern with material property. Attila slaughters— the Witch Doctor proclaims to the survivors that scourges are a retribution for their sins. Attila rules by means of fear , by keeping men under a constant threat of destruction—the Witch Doctor rules by means of guilt , by keeping men convinced of their innate depravity, impotence and insignificance. Attila tu rns men’s life on earth into a living hell—the Witch Doctor tells them that it could not be otherwise. But the alliance of the two rulers is precarious: it is based on mutual fear and mutual contempt. Attila is an extr overt, resentful of any concern with consciousness—the Witch Doctor is an introvert, resentful of any concern with physical existence. Attila professe s scorn for values, ideals, principles, theories, abstractions—the Witch Doctor professes scorn for material property, for wealth, for man’s body, for this earth. Attila considers the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 16 Witch Doctor impractical—the Witch Do ctor considers Attila immoral. But, secretly, each of them believes that the other possesses a mysterious faculty he lacks, that the other is the true mast er of reality, the tr ue exponent of the power to deal with Existence. In te rms, not of thought, ; but of chronic anxiety, it is the Witch Doctor who believes that brute force rules the world—and it is Attila who believes in the supernatural; his name for it is “fate” or “luck.” Against whom is this alliance formed? Against those men whose existence and character both Attila and th e Witch Doctor refuse to admit into their view of the universe: the men who produce. In any age or society, there are men who think and work, who discover how to deal with existence, how to produce the intellectual and the materi al values it requires. These are the men whose effort is the only means of survival for the parasites of all varieties: the Attilas, the Witch Doct ors and the human ballast. The ballast consists of those who go th rough life in a state of unfocused stupor, merely repeating the words and the motions th ey learned from others. But the men from whom they learn, the men who ar e first to discover any scrap of new knowledge, are the men who deal with reality, with the task of conquering nature, and who, to that extent, assu me the responsibility of cognition: of exercising their rational faculty. A producer is any man who works and knows what he is doing. He may function on a fully human, conceptual le vel of awareness only some part of his time, but, to that extent, he is the Atlas who supports the existence of mankind; he may spend the rest of his time in an unthinking daze, like the others, and, to that extent, he is th e exploited, drained, tortured, self- destroying victim of their schemes. Men’s epistemology—or, more precisely, their psycho-epistemology , their method of awareness—is the most funda mental standard by which they can be classified. Few men are consistent in that respect; most men keep switching from one level of awarene ss to another, according to the circumstances or the issues involved, ranging from moments of full rationality to an almost somnambulis tic stupor. But the battle of human history is fought and determined by th ose who are predominantly consistent, those who, for good or evil, are committ ed to and motivated by their chosen psycho-epistemology and its corollary view of existence—with echoes responding to them, in support or opp osition, in the switching, flickering souls of the others. A man’s method of using his consci ousness determines his method of survival. The three contestants ar e Attila, the Witch Doctor and the Producer—or the man of force, the man of feelings, the man of reason—or"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 17 the brute, the mystic, the thinker. The rest of mankind calls it expedient to be tossed by the current of events from one of those roles to another, not choosing to identify the fact that thos e three are the source which determines the current’s direction. The producers, so far, have been the forgotten men of history. With the exception of a few brief periods, the pr oducers have not been the leaders or the term-setters of men’s societies, although the degree of their influence and freedom was the degree of a so ciety’s welfare and progress. Most societies have been ruled by Attila a nd the Witch Doctor. The cause is not some innate tendency to evil in human nature, but the fact that reason is a volitional faculty which man has to choose to discover, employ and preserve. Irrationality is a state of defaul t, the state of an unachieved human stature. When men do not choose to reach the conceptual level, their consciousness has no recourse but to its automatic, perceptual, semi-animal functions. If a missing link between the hum an and the animal species is to be found, Attila and the Witch Doctor are that missing link—the profiteers on men’s default. The sound of the first human step in re corded history, the prelude to the entrance of the producer on the histori cal scene, was the birth of philosophy in ancient Greece. All earlier cultures ha d been ruled, not by reason, but by mysticism: the task of ph ilosophy—the formulation of an integrated view of man, of existence, of the universe— was the monopoly of various religions that enforced their views by the aut hority of a claim to supernatural knowledge and dictated the rules that controlled men’s lives. Philosophy was born in a period when Attila was impotent to assist the Witch Doctor—when a comparative degree of political free dom undercut the power of mysticism and, for the first time, man was free to face an unobstructe d universe, free to declare that his mind was competent to deal with all the problems of his existence and that reason was his only means of knowledge. Even though the influence of the W itch Doctor’s views permeated the works of the early philosophers, reason, for the first time, was identified and acknowledged as man’s ruling faculty , a recognition it had never been granted before. Plato’s system was a monument to the Witch Doctor’s metaphysics—with its two realities, wi th the physical world as a semi- illusory, imperfect, inferior real m, subordinated to a realm of abstractions (which means, in fact, though not in Plato’s statement: subordinated to man’s consciousness), with reason in the position of an inferior but necessary servant that paves the wa y for the ultimate burst of mystic revelation which discloses a “superior” truth. But Aristotle’s philosophy was the intellect’s Declaration of Independe nce. Aristotle, the father of logic,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 18 should be given the title of the world’s first intellectual , in the purest and noblest sense of that word. No matter wh at remnants of Platonism did exist in Aristotle’s system, his incomparable achievement lay in the fact that he defined the basic principles of a rational view of existence and of man’s consciousness: that there is only one reality, the one which man perceives— that it exists as an objective absolute (which means: independently of the consciousness, the wishes or the feelings of any perceiver)—that the task of man’s consciousness is to perceive , not to create, reality—that abstractions are man’s method of integrating his sensory material—that man’s mind is his only tool of knowledge—that A is A. If we consider the fact that to this day everything that makes us civilized beings, every rational value that we po ssess—including the birth of science, the industrial revolution, the creation of the United States, even the structure of our language—is the result of Aris totle’s influence, of the degree to which, explicitly or implicitly, men ac cepted his epistemological principles, we would have to say: never have so many owed so much to one man. Just as the Witch Doctor is impotent without Attila, so Attila is impotent without the Witch Doctor; neither can ma ke his power last without the other. Politically, the centuries of the Greco-Roman civilization were still dominated by Attila (by the rule of local tyrants or tribal aristocracies), but it was a tame, uncertain, subdued Attila, who had to contend with the influence of philosophy (not of faith) in men’s minds. The best aspects of Western civilization still owe their roots to the in tellectual achievements of that era. Attila regained his power with the rise of statism in the Roman Empire. What followed was the fall of Rome, as a drained hulk, bankrupt in spirit and body, unable to muster any power of resistance to the invasion of barbarian hordes—then the looting and devastation of Eu rope by the literal Attila , and the centuries of brute violen ce, of bloody tribal warfare, of unrecorded chaos, known as the Dark Ages. The Witch Doctors were re- emerging, with a new version of mysticism, in answer to the pleas for help of the various local Attilas, who were bowing to them voluntarily, in speedy conversions, in exchange for the guidan ce of some form of basic principles to help them stabilize their power. The Middle Ages was a period ruled by the Witch Doctor, in a firm, if mutually jealous, alliance with Attila . The Witch Doctors controlled every aspect of human life and thought, while the feudal Attilas looted one another’s domains, collected materi al tributes from serfs—who worked, lived and starved in subhuman c onditions—and maintained the Witch Doctors’ monopoly on spiritual law and order, by the power to burn heretics at the stake."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 19 Philosophy, in that era, existed as a “handmaiden of theology,” and the dominant influence was, appropriately, Pl ato’s in the form of Plotinus and Augustine. Aristotle’s works were lo st to the scholars of Europe for centuries. The prelude to the Renaissance was the return of Aristotle via Thomas Aquinas. The Renaissance—the rebirth of man’ s mind—blasted the rule of the Witch Doctor sky-high, setting the earth free of his power. The liberation was not total, nor was it immediate: th e convulsions lasted for centuries, but the cultural influence of mysticism—of a vowed mysticism—was broken. Men could no longer be told to reject their mind as an impotent tool, when the proof of its potency was so ma gnificently evident that the lowest perceptual-level mentality was not able fully to evade it: men were seeing the achievements of science . The Renaissance did not dethrone Attila at once: he clung to his fading power a while longer, building his abso lute monarchies on the remnants of his crumbling feudal state. But once agai n, as in the Greco -Roman era, Attila was ineffectual when left on his own. He was mentally helpless and scared, unable to cope with the tide of libera tion sweeping the world. He ran blindly amuck in the practice of his only sk ill and purpose, that of material extortion, bringing nations to ragged pov erty by his constant wars and levies, taxing away the last of his subjects’ possessions. But when it came to intellectual issues, he kept appeasing the advocates of freedom, he assumed the role of their pupil, protector and “patron of the arts,” lapsing occasionally into frantic bursts of censorship “and persecution, then returning to the role of “enlightened monarch.” Attil a, like any bully and like many animals, feels confident only when he smells fear in his opponents— and it is not fear that thinkers project when they fight for the freedom of the mind. “The divine right of kings” wa s not much of a weapon against men who were discovering the rights of man . The industrial revolution completed the task of the Renaissance: it blasted Attila off his throne. For the first time in history, men ga ined control over physical nature and threw off the c ontrol of men over men—that is: men discovered science a nd political freedom. The first society in history whose leaders were neither Attilas nor Witch Doctors, a society led, do minated and created by the Producers , was the United States of America. The moral code implicit in its political principles was not the Witch Doctor’s code of se lf-sacrifice. The political principles embodied in its Constitution were not Attila’s blank check on brute force, but men’s protection against any future Attila’s ambition."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 20 The Founding Fathers were neither passive, death-worshipping mystics nor mindless, power-seeking looters; as a political group, they were a phenomenon unprecedented in history: they were thinkers who were also men of action. They had rejected th e soul-body dichotomy, with its two corollaries: the impotence of man’s mi nd and the damnation of this earth; they had rejected the doctrine of suffe ring as man’s metaphysical fate, they proclaimed man’s right to the pursuit of happiness and were determined to establish on earth the conditions require d for man’s proper existence, by the “unaided” power of their intellect. A society based on and geared to the conceptual level of man’s consciousness, a society dominated by a philosophy of reason, has no place for the rule of fear and guilt. Reason requires freedom, self-confidence and self-esteem. It requires the right to th ink and to act on the guidance of one’s thinking—the right to live by one ’s own independent judgment Intellectual freedom cannot exist without political freedom; political freedom cannot exist without economic freedom; a free mind and a free market are corollaries . The unprecedented social system whos e fundamentals were established by the Founding Fathers, the system whic h set the terms, the example and the pattern for the nineteenth century—spr eading to all the countries of the civilized world—was capitalism . To be exact, it was not a full , perfect, totally unregulated laissez-faire capitalism. Various degrees of govern ment interference and control still remained, even in Americ a, as deadly cr acks in the system’s foundations. But during the nineteenth century, the world came close to economic freedom, for the first and only time in history. The degree of any given country’s economic freedom was the exac t degree of its progress. America, the freest, achieved the most. Capitalism wiped out slavery in matter and in spirit It replaced Attila and the Witch Doctor, the looter of wealth and the purveyor of revelations, with two new types of man: the producer of wealth and the purveyor of knowledge— the businessman and the intellectual . Capitalism demands the best of ev ery man—his rationality—and rewards him accordingly. It leaves every man free to choose the work he likes, to specialize in it, to trade his product for the products of others, and to go as far on the road of achievement as his ability and ambition will carry him. His success depends on the objective value of his work and on the rationality of those who recognize that value.

In this complex pattern of human co-operation, tw o key figures act as the twin-motors of progress, the integrators of the entire system, the transmission belts that carry the achie vements of the best minds to every level of society: the intellectual and the businessman. The professional intellectual is th e field agent of the army whose commander-in-chief is the philosopher . The intellectual carries the application of philosophical principles to every field of human endeavor. He sets a society’s course by transmitting ideas from the “ivory tower” of the philosopher to the university professo r—to the writer—to the artist—to the newspaperman—to the politician—to th e movie maker—to the night-club singer—to the man in the street The in tellectual’s specific professions are in the field of the sciences that study ma n, the so-called “humanities,” but for that very reason his influence extends to all other professions. Those who deal with the sciences studying nature have to rely on the intellectual for philosophical guidance and informati on: for moral values, for social theories, for political premises, for psyc hological tenets and, above all, for the principles of epistemology, that crucial branch of philosophy which studies man’s means of knowledge and makes all other sciences possible. The intellectual is the eyes, ears and voice of a free society: it is his job to observe the events of the world, to ev aluate their meaning and to inform the men in all the other fields. A free societ y has to be an informed society. In the stagnation of feudalism, with caste s and guilds of serfs repeating the same motions generation afte r generation, the services of traveling minstrels chanting the same old legends were suffi cient. But in the racing torrent of progress which is capitalism, where the free choices of individual men determine their own lives and the co urse of the entire economy, where opportunities are unlimited, where di scoveries are constant, where the achievements of every profession a ffect all the others, men need a knowledge wider than their particular specialties, they need those who can point the way to the better mousetrap—or the better cyclotron, or the better symphony, or the better view of exis tence. The more specialized and diversified a society, the greater its need for the integrating power of knowledge; but the acquisition of knowle dge on so wide a scale is a full- time profession. A free society has to co unt on the honor of its intellectuals: it has to expect them to be as efficient, reliable, precise and objective as the printing presses and the televisi on sets that carry their voices."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 22 The professional businessman is th e field agent of the army whose lieutenant-commander-in-chief is the scientist . The businessman carries scientific discoveries from the laboratory of the inventor to industrial plants, and transforms them into material products that fill men’s physical needs and expand the comfort of men’s existe nce. By creating a mass market, he makes these products available to every income level of society. By using machines, he increases the productivity of human labor, thus raising labor’s economic rewards. By organizing human effort into productive enterprises, he creates employment for men of countless professions. He is the great liberator who, in the short span of a century and a half, has released men from bondage to their physical needs, ha s released them from the terrible drudgery of an eighteen-hour workda y of manual labor for their barest subsistence, has released them fro m famines, from pestilences, from the stagnant hopelessness and terror in which most of mankind had lived in all the pre-capitalist centuries—and in wh ich most of it still lives, in non- capitalist countries. It is on this fundamental division of labor and of responsibility that the intellectual has defaulted. His twin brother, the businessman, has done a superlative job and has brought me n to an unprecedented material prosperity. But the intellectual has so ld him out, has betrayed their common source, has failed in his own job and has brought men to spiritual bankruptcy. The businessman has raised men’s standard of living—but the intellectual has dropped men’s standard of thought to the level of an impotent savage. It has often been noted that mankind has achieved an enormous material progress, but has remained on the level of the primitive brute in spirit (The solution usually offered is to abandon material progress.) The cause of the discrepancy is ignored or evaded. The caus e is to be found at that crossroads of the post-Renaissance period wher e man’s physical existence and his philosophy broke apart and went in different directions. Just as a man’s actions are preceded and determined by some form of idea in his mind, so a society’s exis tential conditions are preceded and determined by the ascendancy of a certain philosophy among those whose job is to deal with ideas. The events of any given period of history are the result of the thinking of the precedi ng period. The nineteenth century—with its political freedom, science, industry, business, trade, all the necessary conditions of material progress—was th e result and the last achievement of the intellectual power released by th e Renaissance. The men engaged in those activities were still riding on the re mnants of an Aristotelian influence in philosophy, particularly on an Aris totelian epistemology (more implicitly"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 23 than explicitly). But they were like men living on the energy of the light rays of a distant star, who did not know (it was not their primary task to know) that that star had been extinguished. It had been extinguished by those whos e primary task was to sustain it. From the start of the post-Renaissan ce period, philosophy—released from its bondage as handmaiden of theo logy—went seeking a new form of servitude, like a frightened slave, br oken in spirit, who recoils from the responsibility of freedom. Descartes set the direction of the retreat by bringing the Witch Doctor back into philosophy. While promising a philosophical system as rational, demonstrable and scientific as mathematics, Descartes began with th e basic epistemological premise of every Witch Doctor (a premise he shar ed explicitly with Augustine): “the prior certainty of consciousne ss,” the belief that the existence of an external world is not self-evident, but must be proved by deduction from the contents of one’s consciousness—which means: the concept of consciousness as some faculty other than the faculty of perception—which means: the indiscriminate contents of one’s cons ciousness as the irreducible primary and absolute, to which reality has to conform. What followed was the grotesquely tragic spectacle of philosophers struggling to prove the existence of an external world by staring, with th e Witch Doctor’s blind, inward stare, at the random twists of their conceptions—then of perceptions—then of sensations. When the medieval Witch Doctor ha d merely ordered men to doubt the validity of their mind, the philosophe rs’ rebellion against him consisted of proclaiming that they doubted whether man was conscious at all and whether anything existed for him to be conscious of. It is at this point that Attila entered the philosophical scene. Attila—the type of man who longs to live on the perceptual level of consciousness, without the “interference” of any concepts, to act on the whim and range of the moment, wit hout the “hampering restriction” of principles or theories, without the ne cessity of integrating one experience with another or one moment with the next—saw his chance to escape from his subservience to the Witch Doctor, which he had always resented (to muscle in on the racket, one woul d have to say), and to obtain from science the sanction of his actions and of his psycho-episte mology. Attila, who hated and feared intellectual issues, saw his chance to take over the intellect and found his voice. When Hume declared that he saw objects moving about, but never saw such a thing as “causality”—it was the voice of Attila that men were hearing. It was Attila’s soul that spoke when Hume de clared that he"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 24 experienced a flow of fleeting states inside his skull, such as sensations, feelings or memories, but had never ca ught the experience of such a thing as consciousness or self . When Hume declared that th e apparent existence of an object did not guarantee that it woul d not vanish spontaneously next moment, and the sunrise of today did not prove that the sun would rise tomorrow; when he declared that ph ilosophical speculation was a game, like chess or hunting, of no significance wh atever to the pract ical course of human existence, since reason proved th at existence was unintelligible and only the ignorant maintained the illusion of knowledge—all of this accompanied by vehement opposition to the mysticism of the Witch Doctor and by protestations of loyalty to reason and science—what men were hearing was the manifesto of a ph ilosophical movement that can be designated only as Attila-ism . If it were possible for an animal to describe the content of his consciousness, the result would be a transcript of Hume’s philosophy. Hume’s conclusions would be the conc lusions of a consciousness limited to the perceptual level of awareness, pa ssively reacting to the experience of immediate concretes, with no capac ity to form abstractions, to integrate perceptions into concepts, waiting in vain for the appearance of an object labeled “causality” (except that such a consciousness would not be able to draw conclusions). To negate man’s mind, it is the conceptual level of his consciousness that has to be invalidated. Under all the tortuous complexities, contradictions, equivocations, rationalizations of the post-Renaissance philosophy—the one consistent line, the fundamental that explains the rest, is: a concerted attack on man ’ s conceptual faculty . Most philosophers did not intend to invalidate conceptual knowledge, but its defenders did more to destroy it than did its enemies. They were unable to offe r a solution to the “problem of universals,” that is: to define the na ture and source of abstractions, to determine the relationship of concepts to perceptual data—and to prove the validity of scientific i nduction. Ignoring the lead of Aristotle, who had not left them a full answer to the problem , but had shown the direction and the method by which the answer could be found, the philosophers were unable to refute the Witch Doctor’s claim that their concepts were as arbitrary as his whims and that their scientific knowledge had no greater metaphysical validity than his revelations. The philosophers chose to solve the problem by conceding the Witch Doctor’s claim and by surrendering to him the conceptual level of man’s consciousness—a victory no Witc h Doctor could have hoped to achieve on his own. The form of that absurd concession was the philosophers’ ultimate"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 25 division into two camps: those who cl aimed that man obtains his knowledge of the world by deducing it exclusivel y from concepts, which come from inside his head and are not derived from the perception of physical facts (the Rationalists)—and those who claimed th at man obtains his knowledge from experience, which was held to mean : by direct perception of immediate facts, with no recourse to concepts (t he Empiricists). To put it more simply: those who joined the Witch Doctor , by abandoning reality—and those who clung to reality, by abandoning their mind. Thus reason was pushed off the philo sophical scene, by default, by implication, by evasion. What had star ted as a serious problem between two camps of serious thinkers soon degene rated to the level where nothing was left on the field of philosophy but a ba ttle between Witch Doctors and Attila- ists. The man who formalized this state, and closed the door of philosophy to reason, was Immanuel Kant. Kant gave metaphysical expression to the psycho-epistemology of Attila and the Witch Doctor and to their pr imordial existential relationship, shutting out of his universe the existe nce and the psycho-epistemology of the Producer. He surrendered philosophy to Attila—and insured its future delivery back into the power of the W itch Doctor. He turned the world over to Attila, but reserved to the Witch Doctor the realm of morality. Kant’s expressly stated purpose was to save the morality of self-abnegation and self-sacrifice. He knew that it could not survive without a mystic base—and what it had to be saved from was reason . Attila’s share of Kant’s universe in cludes this earth, physical reality, man’s senses, perceptions, reason an d science, all of it labeled the “phenomenal” world. The Witch Doctor’s share is another, “higher,” reality, labeled the “noumenal” world, and a special manifesta tion, labeled the “categorical imperative,” which dictates to man the rules of morality and which makes itself known by means of a feeling , as a special sense of duty. The “phenomenal” world, said Kant, is not real: reality, as perceived by man’s mind, is a distortion. The dist orting mechanism is man’s conceptual faculty: man’s basic concepts (such as ti me, space, existence) are not derived from experience or reality, but come from an automatic system of filters in his consciousness (labeled “categories” and “forms of perception”) which impose their own design on his percepti on of the external world and make him incapable of perceiving it in any ma nner other than the one in which he does perceive it. This proves, said Kant, that man’s concepts are only a delusion, but a collective delusion which no one has the power to escape. Thus reason and science are “limited,” sa id Kant; they are valid only so long"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 26 as they deal with this world, with a permanent, pre-determined collective delusion (and thus the criterion of reason’s validity was switched from the objective to the collective ), but they are impotent to deal with the fundamental, metaphysical issues of existence, which belong to the “noumenal” world. The “noumenal” worl d is unknowable; it is the world of “real” reality, “superior” truth and “thing s in themselves” or “things as they are”—which means: th ings as they are not perceived by man. Even apart from the fact that Kant’s theory of the “categories” as the source of man’s concepts was a pre posterous invention, his argument amounted to a negation, not only of man’s consciousness, but of any consciousness, of consciousness as such . His argument, in essence, ran as follows: man is limited to a consciousness of a specific nature, which perceives by specific means and no othe rs, therefore, his consciousness is not valid; man is blind, because he has eyes—deaf, because he has ears— deluded, because he has a mind—and the things he perceives do not exist, because he perceives them. As to Kant’s version of morality, it wa s appropriate to the kind of zombies that would inhabit that kind of unive rse: it consisted of total, abject selflessness . An action is moral, said Kant , only if one has no desire to perform it, but performs it out of a sense of duty and derives no benefit from it of any sort, neither ma terial nor spiritual; a be nefit destroys the moral value of an action. (Thus, if one has no desire to be evil, one cannot be good; if one has, one can.) Those who accept any part of Kant’s philosophy—metaphysical, epistemological or moral—deserve it. If one finds the present state of the world unintelligible and inexplicable, one can begin to understa nd it by realizing that the dominant intellectual influence today is still Kant’s—and th at all the leading modern schools of philosophy are derived from a Kantian base. The popular slang expression “head-shrin ker,” applied to psychologists, is much more literally applicable to Ka nt: observe the sharp drop in the intellectual stature of the post-Kantia n philosophers, and the progressively thickening veil of grayness, superfici ality, casuistry that descends on the history of philosophy thereafter—like a fog enveloping a sluggish river that runs thinner and thinner a nd finally vanishes in the swamps of the twentieth century. The major line of philosophers reject ed Kant’s “noumenal” world quiet speedily, but they accepted his “pheno menal” world and carried it to its logical consequences: the view of rea lity as mere appearance; the view of man’s conceptual faculty as a me chanism for producing arbitrary"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 27 “constructs” not derived fr om experience or facts; the view of rational certainty as impossible, of scienc e as unprovable, of man’s mind as impotent—and, above all, the equation of morality w ith selflessness. They rejected the root or cause of Kant’s system, but accepted all of its deadly effects. They accepted it as some mons trous spider hanging in midair, in a web of unintelligible, almost unreadab le verbiage—and, today, few people know that that spider is not sup ported by a single thread of proof. Such was the intellectual equipment with which philosophers approached the task of observing the unprecedented historical events of the nineteenth century, and the responsibility of providing guidance for the new, free society of capitalism. While scientists were performing ast ounding feats of disciplined reason, breaking down the barriers of the “unknowable” in every field of knowledge, charting the course of light rays in space or the course of blood in the capillaries of man’s body—what philosophy was offering them, as interpretation of and guidance for their achievements was the plain Witch- doctory of Hegel, who proclaimed that matter does not exist at all, that everything is Idea (not somebody’s idea, just Idea ), and that this Idea operates by the dialectical process of a new “super-logic” which proves that contradictions are the law of reality, that A is non-A, and that omniscience about the physical universe (including electricity, gravitation, the solar system, etc.) is to be derived, not from the observation of facts, but from the contemplation of that Idea’s triple so mersaults inside his, Hegel’s, mind. This was offered as a philosophy of reason. While businessmen were rising to spectacular achievements of creative ability and self-confidently ambitious courage, challenging the primordial dogma of man’s poverty and misery on ear th, breaking open the trade routes of the world, releasing mankind’s productive energy and placing in its service the liberating power of machines (against the scornful resistance of loafing, ex-feudal aristocrats and the destructive violence of those who were to profit most: the workers)—what philo sophy was offering, as an evaluation of their achievements and as guidance for the rest of society was the pure Attila-ism of Marx, who proclaimed that the mind does not exist, that everything is matter, that matter devel ops itself by the dialectical process of its own “super-logic” of contradictions, and what is true today, will not be true tomorrow, that the material tools of production determine men’s “ideological superstructure” (which m eans: machines create men’s thinking, not the other way around), that muscular labor is the source of wealth, that physical force is the only practical mean s of existence, and that the seizure of the omnipotent machines will transfer omnipotence to the rule of brute"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 28 violence. Never had Attila’s psycho- epistemology been transcribed so accurately. This was offered as a philosophy of history and of political economy. What was offered as philosophical an tidote to those who would not accept these theories? As a defense against the Witch-doctory of Kant and Hegel, the businessman was offered me neo-mystic Attila -ism of the Pragmatists. They declared that philosophy must be practical and that practica lity consists of dispensing with all absolute principles and standards—that there is no such thing as objective reality or permanent truth—that truth is that which works , and its validity can be judged only by its consequences—that no facts can be known with certainty in advance, a nd anything may be tried by rule-of- thumb—that reality is not firm, but fl uid and “indeterminate,” that there is no such thing as a distinction between an external world and a consciousness (between the perceived and the perceive r), there is only an undifferentiated package-deal labeled “experience,” and whatever one wishes to be true, is true, whatever one wishes to exist, does exist, provided it works or makes one feel better. A later school of more Kantian Pragm atists amended this philosophy as follows. If there is no such thing as an objective reality, men’s metaphysical choice is whether the selfish, dictat orial whims of an individual or the democratic whims of a collective are to shape that plastic goo which the ignorant call “reality,” therefore this school decided that objectivity consists of collective subjectivism —that knowledge is to be gained by means of public polls among special elites of “competent investigators” who can “predict and control” reality—that whatever people wish to be true, is true, whatever people wish to exist, does exist, and anyone who holds any firm convictions of his own is an arbitrar y, mystic dogmatist, since reality is indeterminate and people de termine its actual nature. The scientist was offered a slightly different version of philosophy. As a defense against the Witch-doctory of Hegel, who claimed universal omniscience, the scientist was offe red the combined neo-mystic Witch- doctory and Attila-ism of the Logical Po sitivists. They assured him that such concepts as metaphysics or existence or reality or thing or matter or mind are meaningless—let the mystics care whethe r they exist or not, a scientist does not have to know it; the task of theo retical science is the manipulation of symbols, and scientists are the special elite whose symbols have the magic power of making reality conform to th eir will (“matter is that which fits mathematical equations”). Knowledge, they said, consists, not of facts, but of words , words unrelated to objects, wo rds of an arbitrary social"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 29 convention, as an irreducible primary; thus knowledge is merely a matter of manipulating language. The job of scien tists, they said, is not the study of reality, but the creation of arbitrary c onstructs by means of arbitrary sounds, and any construct is as valid as another, since the criterion of validity is only “convenience” and the definition of scien ce is “that which the scientists do.” But this omnipotent power, surpassing the dreams of ancient numerologists or of medieval alchemists, was gran ted to the scientist by philosophical Attila-ism on two conditions: a . that he never claim certainty for his knowledge, since certainty is unknowable to man, and that he claim, instead, “percentages of probability,” not troublin g himself with such questions as how one calculates percen tages of the unknowable; b . that he claim as absolute knowledge the proposition that all values lie outsi de the sphere of science, that reason is impotent to deal with morality, that moral values are a matter of subjective choice, dictated by one’s feelings, not one’s mind. The great treason of the philosophers wa s that they never stepped out of the Middle Ages: they never challenged the Witch Doctor’s code of morality. They were willing to doubt the existence of physical objects, they were willing to doubt the validity of their own senses, they were willing to defy the authority of absolute mona rchies, they were willing (occasionally) to proclaim themselves to be skeptics or agnostics or atheis ts—but they were not willing to doubt the doctrine that ma n is a sacrificial animal, that he has no right to exist for his own sake, th at service to others is the only justification of his existence and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value. Under all its countless gui ses, variations and adaptations, that doctrine— best designated as the morality of altruism—has come from prehistoric swamps to New York City, unchanged. In savage societie s, men practiced the ritual of human sacr ifices, immolating individual men on sacrificial altars, for the sake of what they rega rded as their collective, tribal good. Today, they are still doing it, only the agony is slower and the slaughter greater—but the doctrine that demands it and sanctions it, is the same doctrine of moral cannibalism. The philosophers preserved it, by leav ing the subject of morality to the mystics—or by consigning it to the province of subjective feelings , which means: to the mystics—or by the veheme nt rejection of reason’s capacity to deal with moral values and the br anding of all value-judgments as “unscientific,” which means: the r eaffirmation and perpetuation of the mystics’ monopoly on morality—or, wors t of all, by accepting the mystics’ moral code in its irrational entirety, th en translating it into earthly terms and propagating it in the name of reason."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 30 The convolutions of this last attempt provide what is, perhaps, the most grotesquely terrible chapter in the history of Western thought The political “me-too-ism,” abjectly displayed by the “conservatives” of today toward their brazenly socialistic adversaries, is only the result and the feeble reflection of the ethical “me-too-ism” displayed by the philosophers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, by the alleged champions of reason, toward the Witch Doctors of morality. Auguste Comte, the founder of Positivism, the champion of science, advocated a “rational,” “scientific” social system based on the total subjugation of the individual to the collective, including a “Religion of Humanity” which substituted Society for the Gods or gods who collect the blood of sacrificial victim s. It is not astonishing that Comte was the comer of the term Altruism , which means: the placing of others above self, of their interests above one’s own. Nietzsche’s rebellion agains t altruism consisted of replacing the sacrifice of oneself to others by the sacrifice of others to oneself. He proclaimed that the ideal man is moved, not by reason, but by his “blood,” by his innate instincts, feelings and will to power—that he is predestined by birth to rule others and sacrifice them to himself, while they are predestined by birth to be his victims and slaves—that reason , logic, principles are futile and debilitating, that morality is useless, that the “superman” is “beyond good and evil,” that he is a “beast of prey” whose ultimate standard is nothing but his own whim. Thus Nietzsche’s rejecti on of the Witch Doctor consisted of elevating Attila into a moral ideal—w hich meant: a double surrender of morality to the Witch Doctor. Jeremy Bentham, the champion of cap italism, defended it by proclaiming “the greatest happiness of the greatest number” as its moral justification— and propounded a “hedonistic calculus” for men’s moral guidance, which enunciated the principle that before ta king any action one must consider all the possible forms and amounts of happ iness and unhappiness to accrue to all the people possibly to be affected by the consequences of one’s action (including oneself as one unit among the dozens or hundreds or millions), one must compute them all, then act accordingly and sacrifice the “hedonistic” minority to the majority. Herbert Spencer, another champion of cap italism, chose to decide that the theory of evolution and of adaptation to environment was the key to man’s morality—and declared that the moral justification of capitalism was the survival of the species, of the human race ; that whoever was of no value to the race, had to perish; that man’s mo rality consisted of adapting oneself to one’s social environment, and seeking one’s own happiness in the welfare of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 31 society; and that the automatic pro cesses of evolution would eventually obliterate the distinction betwee n selfishness and unselfishness. And when Karl Marx, the most consis tent translator of the altruist morality into practical action and politi cal theory, advocated a society where all would be sacrificed to all, starting with the immediate immolation of the able, the intelligent, the successful and the wealthy—whatever opposition he did encounter, nobody opposed him on moral grounds. Predominantly, he was granted the status of a noble, but impractical, idealist . The great treason of the philosophers was that they, the thinkers, defaulted on the responsibility of providing a rational society with a code of rational morality . They, whose job it was to discover and define man’s moral values, stared at the brilliant torrent of man’ s released energy and had nothing better to offer for its guidance than the Witch Doctor’s morality of human sacrifices—of self-denial, self-abase ment, self-immolation—of suffering, guilt and death. The failure of philosophers to challe nge the Witch Doctor’s morality, has cost them their kingdom: philosophy. The relationship of reason and morality is reciprocal: the man who accep ts the role of a sacrificial animal, will not achieve the self-confidence nece ssary to uphold the validity of his mind—the man who doubts the validity of his mind, will not achieve the self-esteem necessary to uphold the va lue of his person and to discover the moral premises that make man’s value possible. The intellectuals share the philosophe rs’ guilt. The intellectuals—all those whose professions deal with the “humanities” and require a firm philosophical base—have known for a long time that no such base existed. They knew that they were functioning in a philosophical vacuum and that the currency they were passing was rubber checks which would bounce, some day, wrecking their culture. One can never know, only surmise, what tragedies, despair and silent devastation have been going on for over a century in the invisible underground of the intellectual pr ofessions—in the souls of their practitioners—nor what incalculable pot ential of human ability and integrity perished in those hidden, lonely c onflicts. The young minds who came to the field of the intellect with the inarticul ate sense of a crusade, seeking rational answers to the problems of achieving a meaningful human existence, found a philosophical con game in place of guidance and leadership. Some of them gave up the field of ideas, in hopeless, indignant frustration, and vanished into the silence of subjectivity. Others gave in, and saw their eagerness turn into bitterness, their quest into apathy, their crusade into a cynical racket. They condemned themselves to the ch ronic anxiety of a con man dreading"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 32 exposure when they accepted the role s of enlightened leaders, while knowing that their knowledge rested on nothing but fog and that its only validation was somebody’s feelings. They, the standard bearer s of the mind, found themselves dreading reason as an enemy, logic as a pursuer, thought as an avenger. They, the proponents of ideas, found themselves clinging to the belief that ideas were impotent: their choice was the futility of a charlatan or the guilt of a traitor. They were not mediocrities when they began th eir careers; they were pretentious mediocrities when they ended. The ex ceptions are growing rarer with every generation. No one can accept with ps ychological impunity the function of a Witch Doctor under the banner of the intellect. With nothing but quicksands to sta nd on—the shifting mixture of Witch- doctory and Attila-ism as their philoso phical base—the intellectuals were unable to grasp, to identify or to eval uate the historical drama taking place before them: the industrial revoluti on and capitalism. They were like men who did not see the splendor of a rocket bursting over their heads, because their eyes were lowered in guilt. It was their job to see and to explain—to a society of men stumbling dazedly ou t of a primeval dungeon—the cause and the meaning of the events that were sweeping them faster and farther than the motion of all the centuries behind them. The intellectuals did not choose to see. The men in the other professions were not able to step back and observe. If some men found themselves leaving their farms for a chance to work in a factory, that was all they knew. If thei r children now had a chance to survive beyond the age of ten (child mortality had been about fifty percent in the pre-capitalist era), they were not able to identify the cause . They could not tell why the periodic famines—that had been striking every twenty years to wipe out the “surplus” population whic h pre-capitalist economies could not feed—now came to an end, as did the carnages of religious wars, nor why fear seemed to be lifting away from people’s voices and from the streets of growing cities, nor why an enormous exultation was suddenly sweeping the world. The intellectuals did not choose to tell them. The intellectuals, or their predomin ant majority, remained centuries behind their time: still seeking the favor of noble protectors, some of them were bewailing the “vulgarity” of co mmercial pursuits, scoffing at those whose wealth was “new,” and, simu ltaneously, blaming these new wealth- makers for all the poverty inherited from the centuries ruled by the owners of nobly “non-commercia l” wealth. Others were denouncing machines as “inhuman,” and factories as a blemish on the beauty of the countryside (where gallows had formerly stood at the crossroads). Still others were"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 33 calling for a movement “back to nature ,” to the handicrafts, to the Middle Ages. And some were attacking scie ntists for inquiring into forbidden “mysteries” and interfering with God’s design. The victim of the intellectuals’ most infamous injustice was the businessman. Having accepted the premises, the mora l values and the position of Witch Doctors, the intellectuals were unw illing to differentiate between the businessman and Attila, between the produ cer of wealth and the looter. Like the Witch Doctor, they scorned and dr eaded the realm of material reality, feeling secretly inadequate to deal w ith it. Like the Witch Doctor’s, their secret vision (almost their feared and e nvied ideal) of a practical, successful man, a true master of reality, wa s Attila; like the Witch Doctor, they believed that force, fraud, lies, plunde r, expropriation, enslavement, murder were practical . So they did not inquire into th e source of wealth or ever ask what made it possible (they had been ta ught that causality is an illusion and that only the immediate moment is real). They took it as their axiom, as an irreducible primary, that wealth can be acquired only by force—and that a fortune as such is the proof of plunder, with no further distinctions or inquiries necessary. With their eyes still fixed on the Middl e Ages, they were maintaining this in the midst of a period when a great er amount of wealth than had ever before existed in the world was be ing brought into existence all around them. If the men who produced that we alth were thieve s, from whom had they stolen it? Under all the shameful twists of their evasions, the intellectuals’ answer was: from those who had not produced it. They were refusing to acknowledge the industria l revolution (they are still refusing today). They were refusing to admit in to their universe what neither Attila nor the Witch Doctor can afford to admit: the existence of man, the Producer. Evading the difference between produc tion and looting, they called the businessman a robber. Evading th e difference betw een freedom and compulsion, they called him a slave dr iver. Evading the difference between reward and terror, they called him an exploiter. Evading the difference between pay checks and guns, they cal led him an autocrat. Evading the difference between trade and force, they called him a tyrant The most crucial issue they had to evade was the difference between the earned and the unearned . Ignoring the existence of the faculty they were betraying, the faculty of discrimination, the intellect they refuse d to identify the fact that industrial wealth was the product of man’s mi nd: that an incalculable amount of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 34 intellectual power, of creative intelligen ce, of disciplined energy, of human genius had gone into the creation of industrial fortunes. They could not afford to identify it, because they could not afford to admit the fact that the intellect is a practical faculty, a guide to man’s successful existence on earth, and that its task is the study of reality (as well as the production of wealth), not the contemplation of uni ntelligible feelings nor a special monopoly on the “unknowable.” The Witch Doctor’s morality of altr uism—the morality that damns all those who achieve success or enjoymen t on earth—provided the intellectuals with the means to make a virtue of evasion. It gave them a weapon that disarmed their victims; it gave them an automatic substitute for self-esteem, and a chance at an unearned moral stature. They proclaimed themselves to be the defenders of the poor against th e rich, righteously evading the fact that the rich were not Attilas any l onger—and the defenders of the weak against the strong, righteously evading the fact that the strength involved was not the strength of brute muscles any longer, but the strength of man’s mind. But while the intellectuals regard ed the businessman as Attila, the businessman would not behave as they , from the position of Witch Doctors, expected Attila to behave: he was impervious to their power. The businessman was as bewildered by events as the rest of mankind, he had no time to grasp his own historical role , he had no moral weapons, no voice, no defense, and—knowing no morality but th e altruist code, yet knowing also that he was functioning agains t it, that self-sacrifice was not his role—he was helplessly vulnerable to the inte llectuals’ attack. He would have welcomed eagerly the guidance of Ar istotle, but had no use for Immanuel Kant. That which today is called “c ommon sense” is the remnant of an Aristotelian influence, and that was the businessman’s only form of philosophy. The businessman asked for pr oof and expected things to make sense—an expectation that kicked the intellectuals into the category of the unemployed. They had nothing to offer to a man who did not buy any shares of any version of the “noumenal” world. To understand the course the intellectuals chose to take, it is important to remember the Witch Doctor’s psycho- epistemology and his relationship to Attila: the Witch Doctor expects Attila to be his protector against reality, against the necessity of rational cognition, and, at the same time, he expects to rule his own protector, who needs an unintelligible mystic sanction as a narcotic to relieve his chronic guilt. Th ey derive their mutual security, not from any form of strength, but from the fact that each has a hold on the other’s secret weakness. It is not the security of two traders, who count on"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 35 the values they offer each other, but the s ecurity of two blackmailers, who count on each other’s fear . The Witch Doctor feels like a me taphysical outcast in a capitalist society—as if he were pushed into some limbo outside of any universe he cares to recognize. He has no means to deal with innocence; he can get no hold on a man who does not seek to liv e in guilt, on a businessman who is confident of his ability to earn his liv ing—who takes pride in his work and in the value of his product—who drives himself with inexhaustible energy and limitless ambition to do better and still better a nd ever better—who is willing to bear penalties for his mist akes and expects rewards for his achievements—who looks at the univers e with the fearless eagerness of a child, knowing it to be intelligible—who de mands straight lines, clear terms, precise definitions—who stands in full sunlight and has no use for the murky fog of the hidden, the secret, the unname d, the furtively evocative, for any code of signals from the psycho-epistemology of guilt. What the businessman offered to th e intellectuals was the spiritual counterpart of his own activity, that which the Witch Doctor dreads most: the freedom of the market place of ideas. To live by the work of one’s mind, to offer men the products of one’s thinking, to provide them with ne w knowledge, to stand on nothing but the merit of one’s ideas and to rely on nothing but objective truth, in a market open to any man who is willing to thin k and has “to judge, accept or reject on his own—is a task that only a ma n on the conceptual level of psycho- epistemology can welcome or fulfill. It is not the place for a Witch Doctor nor for any mystic “elite.” A Witch Do ctor has to live by the favor of a protector, by a special dispensation, by a reserved monopoly, by exclusion, by suppression, by censorship . Having accepted the philosophy and the psycho-epistemology of the Witch Doctor, the intellectuals had to cut the ground from under their own feet and turn against their own historical distinction: against the first chance men had ever had to make a professional living by means of the intellect. When the intellectuals rebelled agains t the “commercialism” of a capitalist society, what they were specifically re belling against was the open market of ideas, where feelings were not accepted and ideas were expected to demonstrate their validity, where the risks were great, injustices were possible and no protector existed but objective reality. Just as Attila, since the Renaissance, was looking for a Witch Doctor of his own, so the intellectuals, since th e industrial revoluti on, were looking for an Attila of their own. The altruist mo rality brought them together and gave"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 36 them the weapon they n eeded. The field where they found each other was Socialism. It was not the businessmen or the indus trialists or the workers or the labor unions or the remnants of the feudal ar istocracy that began the revolt against freedom and the demand for the return of the absolute state: it was the intellectuals. It was the alleged guard ians of reason who brought mankind back to the rule of brute force. Growing throughout the nineteenth ce ntury, originated in and directed from intellectual salons, sidewalk cafes, basement beer joints and university classrooms, the industrial counter-re volution united the Witch Doctors and the Attila-ists. They demanded the right to enforce ideas at the point of a gun, that is: through the power of gove rnment, and compel the submission of others to the views and wishes of those who would gain control of the government’s machinery. They extolled the State as the “Form of the Good,” with man as its abject servant, and th ey proposed as many variants of the socialist state as there had been of the altruist morality. But, in both cases, the variations merely played with the surface, while the cannibal essence remained the same: socialism is the doc trine that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that his life and his work do not belong to him , but belong to society, that the only justification of his existence is his service to society, and that society may dispose of him in any way it pleases for the sake of whatever it deems to be its own tribal, collective good. It is only the Attila-ist, pragmatist, positivist, anti-conceptual mentality— which grants no validity to abstracti ons, no meaning to principles and no power to ideas—that can still wonder why a theoretical doctrine of that kind had to lead in practice to the torrent of blood and brute, non-human horror of such socialist societies as Nazi Germa ny and Soviet Russia. Only the Attila- ist mentality can still claim that nobody can prove that these had to be the necessary results—or still try to blame it on the “imperfection” of human nature or on the evil of some speci fic gang who “betrayed a noble ideal,” and still promise that its own gang w ould do it better and make it work—or still mumble in a quavering voice that the motive was love of humanity. The pretenses have worn thin, the ev asions do not work any longer; the intellectuals are aware of their guilt, but are still struggling to evade its cause and to pass it on to the universe at large, to man’s metaphysically predestined impotence. Guilt and fear are the disintegrators of a man’s cons ciousness or of a society’s culture. Today, America’s culture is being splintered into disintegration by the three injunctions which permeate our intellectual"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 37 atmosphere and which are typical of guilt: don’t look—don’t judge—don’t be certain. The psycho-epistemological meaning and implementation of these three are: don’t integrate—don’t evaluate—give up. The last stand of Attila-ism, both in philosophy and in science, is the concerted assertion of all the neo-mys tics that integration is impossible and unscientific. The escape from the concep tual level of consciousness, the progressive contraction of man’s visi on down to Attila’s range, has now reached its ultimate climax. Withdrawi ng from reality a nd responsibility, the neo-mystics proclaim that no entities ex ist, only relationshi ps, and that one may study relationships without anything to relate, and, simultaneously, that every datum is single and discrete, and no datum can ever be related to any other data—that context is irreleva nt, that anything may be proved or disproved in midair and midstream, a nd the narrower the subject of study, the better—that myopia is the hallmar k of a thinker or a scientist. System-building—the integration of kno wledge into a coherent sum and a consistent view of reality—is denounced by all the Attila-ists as irrational, mystical and unscientific. This is A ttila’s perennial way of surrendering to the Witch Doctor—and it explains why so many scientists are turning to God or to such flights of mysticism of their own as would make even an old- fashioned Witch Doctor blush. No c onsciousness can accept disintegration as a normal and permanent state. Science was born as a result and consequence of philosophy; it cannot survive without a philosophical (particularly epistemological) base. If philosophy perishes, science will be next to go. The abdication of philosophy is all but complete. Toda y’s philosophers, qua Witch Doctors, declare th at nobody can define what is philosophy or what is its specific task, but this need not prevent anyone from practicing it as a profession. Qua Attila-ists, they declare that the use of wide abstractions or concepts is the prerogative of the la yman or of the ignorant or of the man in the street—while a philosopher is one who, knowing all the difficulties involved in the problem of abstractions , deals with nothing but concretes. The injunction “don’t judge” is the ultim ate climax of the altruist morality which, today, can be seen in its naked essence. When men plead for forgiveness, for the nameless, cosmic forgiveness of an unconfessed evil, when they react with instantaneous compassion to any guilt, to the perpetrators of any atrocity, while turning away indifferently from the bleeding bodies of the victims and the innocent—one may see the actual purpose, motive and psychological appeal of the altruist code. When these same compassionate men turn with snarling hatred upon anyone who"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 38 pronounces moral judgments, when they scream that the only evil is the determination to fight against evil— one may see the kind of moral blank check that the altrui st morality hands out. Perhaps the most craven attitude of all is the one expressed by the Injunction “don’t be certain.” As stat ed explicitly by many intellectuals, it is the suggestion that if nobody is certain of anything, if nobody holds any firm convictions, if everybody is willing to give in to everybody else, no dictator will rise among us and we will escape the destruction sweeping the rest of the world. This is the secret voice of the Witch Doctor confessing that he sees a dictator, an Attila, as a man of confident strength and uncompromising conviction. Nothing but a psycho-epistemological panic can blind such intellectuals to the fact that a dictator, like any thug, runs from the first sign of confident resistance; that he can rise only in a society of precisely such uncer tain, compliant, shaking compromisers as they advocate, a society that invites a thug to take over; and that the task of resisting an Attila can be accomp lished only by men of intransigent conviction and moral certainty—not by ch ickens hiding their heads in the sand (“ostrich” is too big and dignified a metaphor for this instance). And, paving the way for Attila, the inte llectuals are still repeating, not by conviction any longer, but by rote, that the growth of government power is not an abridgment of freedom—that the demand of one group for an unearned share of another group’s in come is not socialism—that the destruction of property rights will not affect any other rights—that man’s mind, intelligence, creative ability are a “ national resource ” (like mines, forests, waterfalls, buffalo reserves a nd national parks) to be taken over, subsidized and disposed of by the gove rnment—that businessmen are selfish autocrats because they are strugglin g to preserve freedom, while the “liberals” are the true champions of liberty because they are fighting for more government controls—that the fact that we are sliding down a road which has destroyed every other country , does not prove that it will destroy ours—that dictatorship is not dict atorship if nobody calls it by that abstract name—and that none of us can help it, anyway. Nobody believes any of it any longe r, yet nobody opposes it. To oppose anything, one needs a firm set of pr inciples, which means: a philosophy. If America perishes, it will perish by intellectual default There is no diabolical conspiracy to destroy it: no conspiracy could be big enough and strong enough. Such cafeteria-socialist conspiracies as do undoubtedly exist are groups of scared, neurotic mediocr ities who find themselves pushed into national leadership because nobody el se steps forward; they are like pickpockets who merely intended to sn atch a welfare-regulation or two and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 39 who suddenly find that their victim is unconscious, that they are alone in an enormous mansion of fabulous weal th, with all the doors open and a seasoned burglar’s job on their hands; watch them now screaming that they didn’t mean it, that they had never advocated the nationalization of a country’s economy. As to the communis t conspirators in the service of Soviet Russia, they are the best illu stration of victory by default: their successes are handed to them by the conce ssions of their victims. There is no national movement for socialism or di ctatorship in America, no “man on horseback” or popular demagogue, nothi ng but fumbling compromisers and frightened opportunists. Yet we ar e moving toward full, totalitarian socialism, with worn, cynical voices telli ng us that such is the irresistible trend of history. History, fate and male volent conspiracy ar e easier to believe than the actual truth: that we are moved by nothing but the sluggish inertia of unfocused minds. Collectivism, as a social ideal, is dead, but capitalism has not yet been discovered. It cannot be discovered by the psycho-epistemology of Witch Doctors and Attila-ists—and as to the bus inessman, he is struggling to forget that he had ever known it. That is his guilt. The businessman, historically, had started as the victim of the intellectuals; but no injustice or exploitation can succeed for long without the sanction of the victim. The bus inessman, who could not accept the intellectual leadership of post-Kantian Witch Doctors, made his fatal error when he conceded to them the field of the intellect. He gave them the benefit of the doubt, at his own expense: he concluded that their meaningless verbiage could not be as bad as it sounded to him , that he lacked understanding, but had no st omach for trying to unders tand that sort of stuff and would leave it respectfully alone. No Witch Doctor could have hoped for a deadlier concession. By becoming anti-intellectual, the bus inessman condemned himself to the position of an Attila. By restric ting his goals, concerns and vision exclusively to his specific productive activ ity, he was forced to restrict his interests to Attila’s narrow range of the physical, the material, the immediately present. Thus he tore hims elf in two by an inner contradiction: he functioned on a confidently ratio nal, conceptual level of psycho- epistemology in business, but repressed all the other aspects of his life and thought, letting himself he carried passi vely along by the general cultural current, in the semi-unfocused, perc eptual-level daze of a man who considers himself impotent to judge what he perceives. It is thus that he turned too often into the tragic phenom enon of a genius in business who is a Babbitt in his private life."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 40 He repressed and renoun ced any interest in ideas, any quest for intellectual values or moral principl es. He could not accept the altruist morality, as no man of self-esteem ca n accept it, and he found no other moral philosophy. He lived by a subj ective code of his own—the code of justice, the code of a fair trader—w ithout knowing what a superlative moral virtue it represented. His private ve rsion or understanding of altruism— particularly in America—took the form of an enormous generosity, the joyous, innocent, benevolent generosity of a self-confident man, who is too innocent to suspect that he is hated for his success, that the moralists of altruism want him to pay financia l tributes, not as kindness, but as atonement for the guilt of having succee ded. There were exceptions; there were businessmen who did accept the fu ll philosophical meaning of altruism and its ugly burden of guilt, but they were not the majority. They are the majority today. No man or group of men can live indefinitely under the pressure of moral injustice: they have to rebel or give in. Most of the businessmen gave in; it would have taken a philosopher to provide them with the intellectual weapons of rebellio n, but they had given up any interest in philosophy. They accepted the burden of an unearned guilt; they accepted the brand of “vulgar materialists”; they accepted the accusations of “predatory greed”—predatory toward the wealth which they had created, greed for the fortunes which, but for them, would not have existed. As a result, consciously or subconsciously, they were driven to the cynical bitterness of the conviction that men are irrational, that reason is impotent in human relationships, that the field of ideas is some dark, gigantic, incomprehensible fraud. No one can accept unearned guilt with psychological impunity. Starting as the most courageous class of men in history, the businessmen have slipped slowly into the position of men motivat ed by chronic fear—in all the social, political, moral, intellectual aspects of their existence. Their public policy consists of appeasing their worst enem ies, placating their most contemptible attackers, trying to make terms with their own destroye rs, pouring money into the support of leftist publicati ons and “liberal” politicians, placing avowed collectivists in charge of thei r public relations and then voicing—in banquet speeches and full-page ads—socia listic protestations that selfless service to society is their only goal, and altruistic apologies for the fact that they still keep two or three percent of profit out of their multi-million-dollar enterprises. There are many different motives behind that policy. Some men are moved by actual guilt: they are the new t ype of businessmen , the product of a “mixed” economy, who make fortun es, not by productive ability and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 41 competition in a free market, but by political pull, by government favors, subsidies, franchises and special privileges; these are psycho- epistemologically and economically clos er to Attila than to the Producer, and have good reason to feel guilty. Others are forced reluctantly into a mixed position, where they still live by productive ability, yet have to depend on government favors in order to function; th ese are the closest to the position of self-destroyers. The ma jority of businessmen—perhaps the ablest and best—work in silence and are never heard from publicly. Most businessmen have probably given up the expectation of any justice from the public. But there is one motive which is shared by too many businessmen and which is the penalty for renouncing th e intellect: an unconfessed fear of ideas under the professed conviction that ideas are futile, which leads to a nervously stubborn evasiveness, an anxi ous feeling or hope that wealth as such is power, that only material po ssessions are of practical importance. Today, the businessman and the inte llectual face each other with the mutual fear and the mutual contempt of Attila and the Witch Doctor. The businessman has lost confidence in a ll theories, and functions on a range-of- the-moment expediency, not daring to lo ok at the future. The intellectual has cut himself off from reality and play s a futile word-game with ideas, not daring to look at the past. The busin essman considers the intellectual impractical; the intellectual consider s the businessman immoral. But, secretly, each of them believes that the other possesses a mysterious faculty he lacks, that the other is the true mast er of reality, the tr ue exponent of the power to deal with existence. It is by this mutual attitude and the philosophical premises from which it comes that they are destroying each other. The major share of the guilt belongs to the intellectual: ph ilosophical leadership was his responsibility, which he betrayed and is now deserting under fire. The most grotesquely anachronistic a nd atavistic spectacle in history is the spectacle of the modern intellectua ls raising the primordial voice of the Witch Doctor and, in the midst of an industrial civilization, wailing about the hopeless misery of life on earth, the depravity of man, the impotence of man’s mind, the ignoble vulgarity of material pursuits, and the nobility of longing for the supernatural. The echoes answering them are the voi ces of the plain, medieval Witch Doctors that are beginning to be heard again, preaching the doctrine of man’s innate, preordained impotence, of humility, passivity, submission and resignation—here, in New York City, th e greatest monument to the potency of man’s mind—and proclaiming that all the disasters of the modern age are man’s punishment for the pride of relying on his intellect, for his attempt to"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 42 Improve his condition, to establish a ra tional society and to achieve a perfect way of life on earth. On a recent television panel disc ussion, an alleged conservative intellectual was asked to define the difference between a “conservative” and a “liberal.” He answered that a “liberal” is one who does not believe in Original Sin. To which a liberal inte llectual replied has tily: “Oh, yes, we do!”—but proceeded to add that the lib erals believe they can improve men’s life just a little . Such is the bankruptcy of a culture. It is into the midst of this dismal gray vacuum that the New Intellectuals must step—and must challenge the wo rshippers of doom, resignation and death, with an attitude best expressed by a paraphrase of an ancient salute: “We who are not about to die ...” Who are to be the New Intellectuals ? Any man or woman who is willing to think. All those who know that man’s life must be guided by reason, those who value their own life and are not willing to surrender it to the cult of despair in the modern jungle of cyni cal impotence, just as they are not willing to surrender the world to the Dark Ages and the rule of the brutes. The need for intellectual leadership was never as great as now. No human being who has a trace of personal worth can be willing to surrender his life without lifting a hand—or a mind—to defe nd it, particularly not in America, the country based on the premise of man’s self-reliance and self-esteem. Americans have known how to erect a superlative material achievement in the midst of an untouched wilderness, ag ainst the resistance of savage tribes. What we need today is to erect a corresponding philosophical structure, without which the material greatness cannot survive. A skyscraper cannot stand on cracker-barrels, nor on wall mottoes, nor on full-page ads, nor on prayers, nor on meta-language. The ne w wilderness to reclaim is philosophy, now all but deserted, with the weeds of prehistoric doctrines rising again to swallow the ruins. To support a cu lture, nothing less than a new philosophical foundation will do. The pr esent state of the world is not the proof of philosophy’s impotence, but the proof of philosophy’s power. It is philosophy that has brought men to this state—it is only philosophy that can lead them out. Those who could become the New In tellectuals are America’s hidden assets; their number is probably greater than anyone can estimate; they exist in every profession, even among the present intellectuals. But they are scattered in silent helplessness thro ughout the country, or hidden in that underground which, in human history, has too often swallowed the best of men’s potential: subjectivity. They are the men who have long since lost"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 43 respect for the cultural standards to wh ich they conform, but who hide their own convictions or repress their ideas or suppress their minds, each feeling that he has no chance against the others , each serving as both victim and destroyer. The New Intellectuals will be those men who will come out into the open and have the courage to break that vicious circle. If they glance at the state of our culture, they will see that the entire miserable show is kept up by nothi ng but routine and pretense, which disguise bewilderment and fear: nobo dy dares to take the first new step, everybody waits for his neighbor’s init iative. If a society reaches the stage where every man accepts the feeling that he is “a strange r and afraid in a world [he] never made,” the world it gives up will be made by Attila. The greatest need today is for men who are not strangers to reality, because they are not afraid of thought. The New Inte llectuals will be those who will take the initiative and the responsibility: they will check their own philosophical premises, identify their convictions, inte grate their ideas into coherence and consistency, then offer to the country a view of existence to which the wise and honest can repair. The New Intellectual will be the man who lives up to the exact meaning of his title: a man who is guided by his intellect —not a zombie guided by feelings, instincts, urges, wishes, wh ims or revelations. Ending the rule of Attila and the Witch Doctor, he will di scard the basic premise that made them possible: the soul-body dichotomy. He will discard its irrational conflicts and contradictions, such as: mind versus heart, thought versus action, reality versus desire, the practical versus the moral. He will be an integrated man , that is: a thinker who is a ma n of action. He will know that ideas divorced from consequent action are fraudulent, and that action divorced from ideas is suicidal. He w ill know that the conceptual level of psycho-epistemology—the volitional le vel of reason and thought—is the basic necessity of man’s survival and his greatest moral virtue. He will know that men need philosophy for the purpose of living on earth . The New Intellectual will be a reuni on of the twins who should never have been separated: the intellectua l and the businessman. He can come from among the best—that is: the most rational—men who may still exist in both camps. In place of an involuntar y Witch Doctor and a reluctant Attila, the reunion will produce two new type s: the practical thinker and the philosophical businessman. The best among the present intellectua ls should consider the tremendous power which they are holding, but have never fully exercised or understood. If any man among them feels that he is the helpless, ineffectual stepson of a “materialistic” culture that grants him neither wealth nor recognition, let him"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 44 remember the meaning of his title: his power is his intellect not his feelings, emotions or intuitions. It is not th e businessmen who have robbed him of efficacy, but those of his colleagues who have degraded his profession to the level of soothsayers, tea-leaf reader s and jungle oracles. Let him break with the neo-mystics; let him realize that id eas are not an escape from reality, not a hobby for “disinterested” neurotics in ivory towers, but the most crucial and practical power in human existence. Then let him become an intellectual leader who assumes full responsibility for the practical consequences of his theories. The best among the businessmen should consider the function of wealth, and realize that the power behind the incomprehensible evil now unleashed against them is their own. Wealth, as such, is only a t ool; by renouncing his intellect, the businessman has placed hi s wealth in the service of his own destroyers. They do not deed to nati onalize his property: they nationalized his mind long ago. Let him now realize that practical action without a theoretical base achieves the opposite of his goals, and that intellectual irresponsibility is not a way of es cape from his enemies. Then let him discover the function of philosophy. Instead of those ludicrous programs of “student exchanges” between America and Soviet Russia, for the alleged purpose of “gaining mutual understanding,” there ought to be a priv ate, voluntary program of “student exchanges” between the intellectuals and the businessmen, the two groups that need each other most, yet know less and understand less about each other than about any alien society in any distant corner of the globe. The businessmen need to discover the intelle ct; the intellectuals need to discover reality. Let the intellectuals understand the nature and the function of a free market in order to offer the businessmen , as well as the public at large, the guidance of an intelligible theoretical framework for dealing with men, with society, with politics, with economics. Let the businessmen learn the basic issues and principles of philosophy in order to know how to judge ideas, then let them assume full responsibili ty for the kind of ideologies they choose to finance and support. Let them both discover (he nature, th e theory and the actual history of capitalism; both groups are equally ignora nt of it No other subject is hidden by so many distortions, misconceptions, misrepresentations and falsifications. Let them study the histor ical facts and discover that all the evils popularly ascribed to capitalism were caused, nece ssitated and made possible only by government controls impos ed on the economy. Whenever they hear capitalism being denounced, let them check the facts and discover which of the two opposite political principles—free trade or government"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 45 controls—was responsible for the alleged iniquities. When they hear it said that capitalism has had its chance and ha s failed, let them remember that what ultimately failed was a “mixed” economy, that the controls were the cause of the failure, and that the way to save a country is not by making it swallow a full, “unmixed” glass of the poison which is killing it. The Founding Fathers were America’s fi rst intellectuals and, so far, her last. It is their basic political line that the New Intellectuals have to continue. Today, that line is lost under layer upon layer of evasions, equivocations and plain falsehood; today’s Witch Doctors claim that the basic premise of the Founding Fathers was faith and uncritical compliance with tradition; today’s Attila-ists claim that that basic premise was the subordination of the individual to the collective and his s acrifice to the public good. The New Intellectuals must remind the world th at the basic premise of the Founding Fathers was man’s right to his own life, to his own liberty, to the pursuit of his own happiness—which means: man’s right to exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others no r sacrificing others to himself; and that the political implementation of this right is a society where men deal with one another as traders , by voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. The moral premises implicit in the political philosophy of the Founding Fathers, in the social system they established and in the economics of capitalism, must now be recognized and accepted in the form of an explicit moral philosophy. That which is merely Implicit is not in men’s conscious control; they can lose it by means of other implications, without knowing what it is that they are losing or when or why. It was the morality of altruism that undercut America and is now dest roying her. From her start, America was torn by the clash of her political system with the altruist morality. Capitalism and altruism are incompatib le; they are philosophical opposites; they cannot co-exist in the same man or in the same society. Today, the conflict has reached its ultimate climax ; the choice is clear-cut: either a new morality of rational self-interest, with its consequences of freedom, justice, progress and man’s happiness on earth—o r the primordial morality of altruism, with its consequences of slav ery, brute force, stagnant terror and sacrificial furnaces. The world crisis of today is a moral crisis—and nothing less than a moral revolution can resolve it: a moral revol ution to sanction and complete the political achievement of the American Revolution. Evasions, equivocations and guilty apologies will not work a ny longer. The disgraceful injustice which penalized virtue for being vi rtue, which forced businessmen to apologize for their ability, for their succe ss, for their achievements, has now been projected onto a global scale a nd translated into the disgraceful"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 46 spectacle of America apologizing for he r virtues and greatness to that bloody slaughterhouse of embodied altruism which is Soviet Russia. The New Intellectuals must fight for cap italism, not as a “practical” issue, not as an economic issue, but, with the most righteous pride, as a moral issue. That is what capitalism de serves, and nothing less will save it The New Intellectuals must assume th e task of building a new culture on a new moral foundation, whic h, for once, will not be the culture of Attila and the Witch Doctor, but the culture of the Producer. They will have to be radicals in the literal and reputable sense of the word: “radical” means “fundamental.” The representativ es of intellectual orthodoxy, conventionality and status quo , the Babbitts of today, are the collectivists. Let those who do care about the future, those willing to crusade for a perfect society, realize that the new radicals are the fighters for capitalism. It is not an easy task and it cannot be achieved overnight But the New Intellectuals have an inestimable advant age: they have reality on their side. The difficulties they will encounter on th eir way are not stone barriers, but fog: the heavy fog of passive disinteg ration, through which it will be hard for them to find one another. They w ill encounter no opposition, since, in this context, an opposition would have to possess intellectual weapons. As to their enemies, they should comply with their enemies’ request—and leave them to heaven. The process of identifying, judging, accepting and upholding a new philosophy of life is a long, complicat ed process, which requires thought, proof, full understanding and convictio n. But there are two principles on which all men of intellectual integrity and good will can agree, as a “basic minimum,” as a precondition of any di scussion, co-operation or movement toward an intellectual Renaissance. One principle is epistemological, the other is moral; they are not axioms , but until a man has proved them to himself and has accepted them, he is not fit for an intellectual discussion. These two principles are: a . that emotions are not tools of cognition; b . that no man has the right to initiate the use of physical force against others. a . The first of these two principles repr esents one’s basic rejection of the Witch Doctor’s psycho-epistemology. It means that one must differentiate between one’s thoughts and one’s emo tions with full clarity and precision. One does not have to be omniscient in order to possess knowledge; one merely has to know that which one does know, and distinguish it from that which one feels. Nor does one need a full system of philosophical epistemology in order to distinguish one’s own considered judgment from one’s feelings, wishes, hopes or fears. Those who claim that they cannot do it are merely confessing that they have never learned how to use their mind"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 47 and are incapable of perceiving, judging or evaluating reality. This may be a psychological problem, but it become s an intellectual fraud when such persons enter a philosophical discussion and demand consideration for their ideas. No discussion, co-operation, ag reement or understanding is possible among men who substitute emotion for proof. b . This second principle represents one’s basic rejection of Attila’s psycho-epistemology. To claim the right to initiate the use of physical force against another man—the right to comp el his agreement by the threat of physical destruction—is to evict onese lf automatically from the realm of rights, of morality and of the intellect . Perhaps the most obscene legacy of altruism among modern intellectuals is their axiomatic acceptance of brute force and of somebody’s sacrifice as a normal and necessary part of a human society, and their refusal to consider the possibility of a non-sacrificial, non- compulsory co-existence and co-opera tion among men. Observe that they cannot conceive of “selfishness” except in terms of sacrificing others to oneself, and they cannot conceive of anyone who does not regard such sacrificing as to his own interest This, of course, is a psychological confession about the nature of their ow n desires and about the Attila in their souls. When they declare that th ey see no difference between economic power and political power—which me ans: no difference between an employer and a holdup man, no differen ce between the United States and Soviet Russia—they are confessing a W itch Doctor’s abject fear of reality, which makes them equate a Producer with an Attila. One would suppose that any man who ma kes claim to the title of moralist, humanitarian or intellectual would spen d his life trying to devise—as an ideal—a social system where no man or group of men may initiate the use of physical force against others or dema nd the sacrifice of anyone to anyone. But when one remembers that such a system was devised and did exist less than a hundred years ago, one knows how to evaluate the brutes and thugs of the spirit who refuse to consider it possible. 2 So long as men believe that the initiation of physical force by some men against others is a proper part of an organized society—hatred, violence, brutality, destruction, slaughter a nd the savage gang warfare of group against group are all they can or will achieve. When physical force is the ultimate arbiter, men are driven to co nnive, conspire a nd gang up on one another in order to destroy rather than be destroyed; the best perish, but the Attilas rise to the top. It might be understandable that primitive, savage  2 The epistemological chaos of today makes it necessary to stress that men have the right and the moral obligation of self-defense, that is: the right to use physical force only as retaliation and only against those who initiate its use.

But when men propose to live in an industrial civili zation by the moral concepts of those jungle savages, with nuclear missiles and H-bombs at their disposal—they deserve the catastrophes they ask for. Let no man posture as an advocate of peace if he proposes or supports any so cial system that initiates the use of physical force against individual men, in any form whatever. Let no man posture as an advocate of freedom if he claims the right to establish his version of a good society where individua l dissenters are to be suppressed by means of physical force. Let no man posture as an intellectual if he proposes to elevate a thug into the position of final authority over the intellect—or if he equates the power of physical com pulsion with the power of persuasion— or if he equates the power of muscles with the power of ideas. No advocate of reason can claim the ri ght to force his ideas on others. No advocate of the free mind can claim the right to for ce the minds of others. No rational society, no co-operation, no agreement, no understanding, no discussion are possible among men who propose to substitute guns for rational persuasion. If men of good will wish to come toge ther for the purpose of upholding reason and establishing a rational soci ety, they should begin by following the example of the cowboys in Western m ovies when the sher iff tells them at the door to a conference room: “Gen tlemen, leave your guns outside.” Those who will accept the “basic mi nimum” of civilization, the two principles stated above, will have made the first step toward the building of a new culture in the wide-open spaces of today’s intellectual vacuum. There is an ancient slogan that applies to ou r present position: “The king is dead— long live the king!” We can say, with th e same dedication to the future: “The intellectuals are dead—long live the in tellectuals!”—and then proceed to fulfill the responsibility which th at honorable title had once implied."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 49 We the Living This novel was published in 1936 and reissued in 1959.

Gail, I think the only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. I’ve always demanded a certain quality in the people I liked. I’ve always recognized it at once—and it’s the only qu ality I respect in men. I chose my friends by that. Now I know what it is. A self-sufficient ego. Nothing else matters.” THE SOUL OF A COLLECTIVIST This excerpt is the confession of R oark’s antipode and archenemy, Ellsworth M. Toohey, an architectural critic an d sociologist, who spends his life plotting the future establishment of a collectivist society. He is addressing one of his own victims. “I’ve always said just that. Clearly, precisely and openly. It’s not my fault if you couldn’t hear. You could, of c ourse. You didn’t want to. Which was safer than deafness—for me. I said I in tended to rule. Like all my spiritual predecessors. But I’m luckier than they were. I inherited the fruit of their efforts and I shall be the one who’ll see the great dream made real. I see it all around me today. I recognize it. I don’t like it. I didn’t expect to like it Enjoyment is not my destiny. I shall fi nd such satisfaction as my capacity permits. I shall rule. ... “It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. If you learn how to rule one single man’s soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It’s the soul, Peter, the soul. Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That’s why the Caesars, the Attilas, the Napoleons were fools and di d not last. We will. The soul, Peter, is that which can’t be ruled. It must be broken.

See if you haven’t heard all this for years, but didn’t want to hear, and the fault is yours, not mine. There are many ways. Here’s one. Make man feel small. Make him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult. The worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct it toward a goal destructiv e of all integrity. Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live for others. Te ll men that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a single one ever will. His every living instinct screams agains t it. But don’t you see what you accomplish? Man realizes that he’s in capable of what he’s accepted as the noblest virtue—and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own basic unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp he gives up eventually all ideals, all aspiration, a ll sense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he can ’t practice. But one can’t be good halfway or honest approximately. To pres erve one’s integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? His soul gives up its self-respect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey. He’ll be glad to obey—because he can’t trust himself, he feels uncerta in, he feels unclean. That’s one way. Here’s another. Kill man’s sense of values. Kill his cap acity to recognize greatness or to achieve it. Great men can ’t be ruled. We don’t want any great men. Don’t deny the conception of gr eatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, the difficult, th e exceptional. Set up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept—and you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perf ection. ... Don’t set out to raze all shrines—you’ll frighten men. Enshri ne mediocrity—and the shrines are razed. Then there’s another way. Kill by laughter. Laughter is an instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into a sneer. It’s simple. Tell them to laugh at ever ything. Tell them that a sense of humor is an unlimited virtue. Don’t let anyt hing remain sacred in a man’s soul— and his soul won’t be sacred to him. Kill reverence and you’ve killed the hero in man. One doesn’t reverence wi th a giggle. He’ll obey and he’ll set no limits to his obedience—anything go es—nothing is too serious. Here’s another way. This is most importa nt. Don’t allow men to be happy. Happiness is self-contained and self-su fficient. Happy men have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living.

They’ll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’s soul—and the space is yours to fill. I don’t see why you should look so shocked, Peter. This is the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great system of ethics, from the Orient up. Didn’t th ey all preach the sacrifice of personal joy? Under all the complications of ve rbiage, haven’t they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-d enial? Haven’t you been able to catch their theme song—‘Give up, give up, gi ve up, give up’? Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjo yable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is consid ered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy—and you’v e damned it. That’s how far we’ve come. We’ve tied happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the throat. Throw your first-born into a sacrif icial furnace—lie on a bed of nails—go into the desert to mortify the flesh— don’t dance—don’t go to the movies on Sunday—don’t try to get rich—don’t smoke —don’t drink. It’s all the same line. The great line. Fools think that tabo os of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned. But there’s always a purpose in nonsense. Don’t bother to examine a folly—ask yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men. Of course, you must dress it up. You must tell people that they’ll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. Y ou don’t have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words. ‘Universal Harmony’—‘Eternal Spirit’—‘Divine Purpose’—‘Nirvana’—‘Paradise’—‘Raci al Supremacy’—‘The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.’ Internal corruption, Peter. That’s the oldest one of all. The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall fo r it. Yet the test should be so simple: just listen to a ny prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice—run. Run faster than from a plague. It stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice, there’s someone co llecting sacrificial offerings. Where there’s service, there’s someone bei ng served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and mast ers. And intends to be the master. But if ever you hear a man telling you th at you must be happy, that it’s your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself—t hat will be the man who’s not after your soul. That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. But let him come and you’ll scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish monster. So the racket is safe for many, many centuries.

He was probably burned at the stake he ha d taught his brothers to light He was considered an evildoer who had dealt with a demon mankind dreaded. But thereafter men had fire to keep them wa rm, to cook their food, to light their caves. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had lifted darkness off the earth. Centuries later, the first man invented the wheel. He was probably torn on the rack he had taught his brothers to build. He was considered a transgressor who ventur ed into forbidden territory. But"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 62 thereafter, men could travel past any hor izon. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had ope ned the roads of the world. “That man, the unsubmissive and first, stands in the opening chapter of every legend mankind has recorded a bout its beginning. Prometheus was chained to a rock and torn by vultures—b ecause he had stolen the fire of the gods. Adam was condemned to suffer—be cause he had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Whatever the legend, somewhere in the shadows of its memory mankind knew that its glory bega n with one and that that one paid for his courage. “Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and me response they r eceived—hatred. The great creators— the thinkers, the artists, the scientists , the inventors—stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The first mo tor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won. “No creator was prompted by a desire to serve his brothers, for his brothers rejected the gift he offered and that gift destroyed the slothful routine of their lives. His truth was hi s only motive. His own truth, and his own work to achieve it in his own way. A symphony, a book, an engine, a philosophy, an airplane or a building— that was his goal and his life. Not those who heard, read, operated, believed, flew or inhabited the thing he had created. The creation, not its users. Th e creation, not the benefits others derived from it. The creati on which gave form to his truth. He held his truth above all things a nd against all men. “His vision, his strength, his courage came from his own spirit. A man’s spirit, however, is his self. That entity which is his consciousness. To think, to feel, to judge, to act are functions of the ego. “The creators were not selfless. It is the whole secret of their power—that it was self-sufficient, self-motivated, se lf-generated. A first cause, a fount of energy, a life force, a Prime Mover. The creator served nothing and no one. He lived for himself. “And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement. “Man cannot survive except thro ugh his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. Animals obtain food by force. Man has no claws, no fangs, no horns, no great strength of muscle. He must plant"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 63 his food or hunt it. To plant, he n eeds a process of thought. To hunt, he needs weapons, and to make weapons—a process of thought. From this simplest necessity to the highest religio us abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and ev erything we have comes from a single attribute of man—the function of his reasoning mind. “But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act—the process of reason—mu st be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. A ll the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred. “We inherit the products of the thou ght of other men. We inherit the wheel. We make a cart. The cart becomes an auto mobile. The automobile becomes an airplane. But all through the process what we receive from others is only the end pr oduct of their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes this product as material, uses it and originates the next step. This creative faculty ca nnot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single, indivi dual men. That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learn from one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man can gi ve another the capac ity to think. Yet that capacity is our on ly means of survival. “Nothing is given to man on earth. Everything he needs has to be produced. And here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways—by the independent work of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of others. The creator originates. The parasite borrows. The creator faces nature alone. The pa rasite faces nature through an intermediary. “The creator’s concern is the conquest of nature. The parasite’s concern is the conquest of men. “The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become his prime motive. “The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsi on. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to any considera tion whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 64 “The basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order to be fed. He places relations firs t. He declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. “Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self. “No man can live for anothe r. He cannot share his spirit just as he cannot share his body. But the second-hander has used altruism as a weapon of exploitation and reversed the base of mankind’s moral principles. Men have been taught every precept that destroys the creator. Men have been taught dependence as a virtue. “The man who attempts to live for othe rs is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach to it in reality—the man who lives to serve others—is the slave. If physical slavery is repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the spirit? The conquered slav e has a vestige of honor. He has the merit of having resisted and of cons idering his condition evil. But the man who enslaves himself voluntarily in the name of love is the basest of creatures. He degrades the dignity of man and he degrades the conception of love. But this is the essence of altruism. “Men have been taught that the highe st virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Yet one cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes before distribution—or there will be not hing to distribute. The need of the creator comes before the need of any po ssible beneficiary. Yet we are taught to admire the second-hander who dispen ses gifts he has not produced above the man who made the gifts possible. We praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act of achievement. “Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the suffering of others. But suffering is a disease. Shoul d one come upon it, one tries to give relief and assistance. To make that the highest test of virtue is to make suffering the most important part of li fe. Then man must wish to see others suffer—in order that he ma y be virtuous. Such is the nature of altruism. The creator is not concerned with disease, but with life. Yet the work of the creators has eliminated one form of di sease after another, in man’s body and spirit, and brought more relief from su ffering than any altruist could ever conceive. “Men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who disagrees. Men ha ve been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creat or is the man who goes against the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 65 current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who stands alone. “Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egoist in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge or act. These are functions of the self. “Here the basic reversal is most dead ly. The issue has been perverted and man has been left no alternative—a nd no freedom. As poles of good and evil, he was offered two conceptions: e goism and altruism. Egoism was held to mean the sacrifice of others to se lf. Altruism—the sacrifice of self to others. This tied man irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his own pain borne for the sake of ot hers or pain inflicted upon others for the sake of self. When it was added that man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap was closed. Man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal—under the threat that sadi sm was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on mankind. “This was the device by which de pendence and suffering were perpetuated as fundamentals of life. “The choice is not self-sacrifi ce or domination. The choice is independence or dependence. The code of the creator or the code of the second-hander. This is the basic issue. It rests upon the alternative of life or death. The code of the creator is built on the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive. The code of the second-hander is built on the needs of a mind incapable of survival. All that which proceeds from man’s independent ego is good. All that which proceeds from man’s dependence upon men is evil. “The egoist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not in the source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man—and he asks no other man to exis t for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual resp ect possible between men. “Degrees of ability vary, but the ba sic principle remains the same: the degree of a man’s independence, initia tive and personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker a nd his worth as a man. Independence is the only gauge of human virtue and va lue. What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or hasn’t d one for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity. There is no sta ndard of personal dignity except independence."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 66 “In all proper relationships there is no sacrifice of anyone to anyone. An architect needs clients, but he does not subordinate his work to their wishes. They need him, but they do not order a house just to give him a commission. Men exchange their work by free, mutu al consent to mutual advantage when their personal interests agree and they both desire the exchange. If they do not desire it, they are not forced to deal with each other. They seek further. This is the only possible form of rela tionship between equals. Anything else is a relation of slave to mast er, or victim to executioner. “No work is ever done collectively, by a majority decision. Every creative job is achieved under the guidance of a single individual thought. An architect requires a great many men to er ect his building. But he does not ask them to vote on his design. They work together by free agreement and each is free in his proper function. An ar chitect uses steel, glass, concrete, produced by others. But the materials re main just so much steel, glass and concrete until he touches them. What be does with them is his individual product and his individual property. This is the only pattern for proper co- operation among men. “The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man’s first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, provided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty, his thinking, his work. But it does not include the sphere of the gangster, the altruist and the dictator. “A man thinks and works alone. A man cannot rob, exploit or rule— alone. Robbery, exploitatio n and ruling presuppose victims. They imply dependence. They are the pr ovince of the second-hander. “Rulers of men are not egoists. They create nothing. They exist entirely through the persons of others. Their goal is in their subjects, in the activity of enslaving. They are as dependent as the beggar, the social worker and the bandit. The form of dependence does not matter. “But men were taught to regard second-hande rs—tyrants, emperors, dictators—as exponents of egoism. By th is fraud they were made to destroy the ego, themselves and others. The purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators. Or to harness them. Which is a synonym. “From the beginning of history, th e two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the second-hander. When the first creator invented the wheel, the first second-hander re sponded. He invented altruism. “The creator—denied, opposed, persecu ted, exploited—went on, moved forward and carried all humanity al ong on his energy. The second-hander"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 67 contributed nothing to th e process except the impediments. The contest has another name: the individual against the collective. “The ‘common good’ of a collective— a race, a class, a state—was the claim and justification of every tyra nny ever established over men. Every major horror of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive. Has any act of selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of altruism? Does the fault lie in men’ s hypocrisy or in the nature of the principle? The most dreadfu l butchers were the most sincere. They believed in the perfect society reached through the guillotine and the firing squad. Nobody questioned their right to murder since they were murdering for an altruistic purpose. It was accepted that man must be sacrificed for other men. Actors change, but the course of the tragedy remains the same. A humanitarian who starts with declarati ons of love for ma nkind and ends with a sea of blood. It goes on and will go on so long as men believe that an action is good if it is unselfish. That pe rmits the altruist to act and forces his victims to bear it. The leaders of collectivist movements ask nothing for themselves. But observe the results. “The only good which men can do to one another and the only statement of their proper relati onship is—Hands off! “Now observe the results of a so ciety built on the principle of individualism. This, our country. The nobl est country in the history of men. The country of greatest achievement, greatest prosperity, greatest freedom. This country was not based on selfless se rvice, sacrifice, renunciation or any precept of altruism. It was based on a man’ s right to the purs uit of happiness. His own happiness. Not anyone else’s. A private, personal, selfish motive. Look at the results. Look into your own conscience. “It is an ancient conflict. Men have come close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. Th e savage’s whole ex istence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men. “Now, in our age, collectivism, the rule of the sec ond-hander and second- rater, the ancient monste r, has broken loose and is running amuck.

They were permitted to do it by the general implication that the altruistic purpose of the building superseded all rights and that I had no claim to stand against it. “I agreed to design Cortlandt for the purpose of seeing it erected as I designed it and for no other reason. That was the price I set for my work. I was not paid. “I do not blame Peter Keating. He wa s helpless. He had a contract with his employers. It was ignored. He had a promise that the structure he offered would be built as designed. The promis e was broken. The love of a man for the integrity of his work and his right to preserve it are now considered a vague intangible and an inessential. Y ou have heard the prosecutor say that. Why was the building disfigured? For no reason. Such acts never have any reason, unless it’s the vanity of some second-handers who feel they have a right to anyone’s property, spiritual or material. Who permitted them to do it? No particular man among the dozens in authority. No one cared to permit or to stop it. No one was responsible. No one can be held to account. Such is the nature of all collective action. “I did not receive the payment I aske d. But the owners of Cortlandt got what they needed from me. They wanted a scheme devised to build a structure as cheaply as possible. Th ey found no one else who could do it to their satisfaction. I could and did.

It is forgotten that but for me the destitute could not have had this particular home. Those who were concerned with th e poor had to come to me, who have never been concerned, in order to help the poor.

Its th eme is: the role of the mind in man’s existence—and, as corollary, the demons tration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest. The story shows what happens to the world when the mind goes on strike — when the men of creative ability , in every profession , quit and disappear . To quote John Galt , the leader and initiator of the strike : “ There is only one kind of men who have never been on strike in human history . Every other kind and class have stopped , when they so wished , and have presented demands to the world , claiming to be indispensable — except the men who have carried the world on their shoulders , have kept it alive , have endured torture as sole payment , but have never walked out on the human race . Well , their turn has come . Let the world discover who they are , what they do and what happens when they refuse to function . This is the strike of the men of the mind .” THE MEANING OF MONEY This is a speech made by Francisco d’ Anconia, copper industrialist, heir to an enormous fortune, Galt’s closest friend and first to join him in going on strike. “So you think that money is the ro ot of all evil?” said Francisco d’Anconia. “Have you ever asked what is the root of money?

Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it wa s created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothi ng but physical motions—and you’ll learn that man’s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth. “But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expens e of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the am bitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made —before it can be looted or m ooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consum e more than he has produced. “To trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willi ng to trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss—the recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your misery—that you must offer th em values, not wounds—that the common bond among men is no t the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods . Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men’s stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best th at your money can find. And when men live by trade—with reason, not force, as their final arbiter—it is the best product that wins, the best perform ance, the man of best judgment and highest ability—and the degree of a ma n’s productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existen ce whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider evil?"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 72 “But money is only a tool.

Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to re verse the law of causality—the men who seek to replace the mind by se izing the products of the mind. “Money will not purchase happiness fo r the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if he’s evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it w ill not provide him with a purpose, if he’s evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors.

It’s the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money—and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it. “Let me give you a tip on a clue to men’s characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; th e man who respects it has earned it. “Run for your life from any man who te lls you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper’s bell of an a pproaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another—their only substitute, if they abandon m oney, is the muzzle of a gun. “But money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pr ide or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their m oney and are not willin g to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich—will not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come craw ling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guilt—and of his life, as he deserves. “Then you will see the rise of the me n of the double standard—the men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money—the men who are th e hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society esta blishes criminals-by-right and looters- by-law—men who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victims—then money becomes its creators’ avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they’ve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, w ho get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to t hose most ruthless at brutality. When force is the st andard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society va nishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter. “Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a society’s virtue .

Money is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not ma ke terms with brut ality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot. “Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men’s protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and deli vers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produ ce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the da y when it bounces, marked: ‘Account overdrawn.’ “When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to st ay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of th e immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, ‘Who is destroying the world?’ You are. “You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonde r why it’s crumbling around you, while you’re damning its life-blood—m oney. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungl e is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout men’ s history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, de prived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slaves—slaves who repeated the motions once disc overed by somebody’s mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer. Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starva tion, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slav es, as traders, as shopkeepers—as industrialists."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 75 “To the glory of mankind, there was, fo r the first and only time in history, a country of money —and I have no higher, more re verent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement.

Americans were the first to unders tand that wealth has to be created. The words ‘to make money’ hold the essence of human morality. “Yet these were the words for wh ich Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters’ continen ts.

Then he will scream th at his body has vicious desires of its own which his mind cannot conquer, that sex is sin, that true love is a pure emotion of the spirit. And then he will wonder why love brings him nothing but boredom, and sex—nothing but shame. ... “You’d never accept any part of their vicious creed. You wouldn’t be able to force it upon yourself. If you tried to damn sex as evil, you’d still find yourself, against your will, acting on the proper moral premise. You’d be attracted to the highest woman you me t. You’d always want a heroine. You’d be incapable of self-contempt . You’d be unable to believe that existence is evil and that you’re a he lpless creature caught in an impossible universe. You’re the man who’s spent his life shaping matter to the purpose of his mind. You’re the man who w ould know that just as an idea unexpressed in physical action is co ntemptible hypocrisy, so is platonic love—and just as physical action unguide d by an idea is a fool’s self-fraud, so is sex when cut off from one’s code of values. It’s the same issue, and you would know it Your inviolate sense of self-esteem would know it. You would be incapable of desire for a woman you despised.

And he cr ies with despair, because he can feel nothing for the women he respects, but finds himself in bondage to an irresistible passion for a slut from th e gutter. He is the man whom people call an idealist. The other kind of half is the man whom people call practical, the man who despises principles, abst ractions, art, philosophy and his own mind. He regards the acquisition of ma terial objects as the only goal of existence—and he laughs at the need to consider their purpose or their source.

Observe the triple fraud which he perpetrates upon himself. He will not acknowledge his need of self-esteem, since he scoffs at such a concept as moral values; yet he feels the profound self-contempt which comes from believing that he is a piece of meat. He will not acknowle dge, but he knows that sex is the physical expression of a tr ibute to personal values. So he tries, by going through the motions of the ef fect, to acquire that which should have been the cause.

It was when the old ma n died and his heirs took over. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter, and they brought a new plan to run the factory.

The plan was that everybody in the factory would work according to his ability, but would be paid according to his need. ... “We voted for that plan at a big meet ing, with all of us present, six thousand of us, everybody that worked in the factory. The Starnes heirs made long speeches about it, and it wa sn’t too clear, but nobody asked any questions. None of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us thought that the next fellow knew it. And if anybody had doubts, he felt guilty and kept his mouth shut—becau se they made it sound like anyone who’d oppose the plan was a child-kil ler at heart and less than a human being. They told us that this plan would achieve a noble ideal. Well, how were we to know otherwise? Hadn’t we heard it all our lives—from our parents and our schoolteachers and our ministers, and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and ever y public speech? Hadn’t we always been told that this was righteous and just? Well, maybe there’s some excuse for what we did at that meeting. S till, we voted for the plan—and what we got, we had it coming to us. You know, ma’am, we are marked men, in a way, those of us who lived through th e four years of that plan in the Twentieth Century factory. What is it that hell is supposed to be? Evil— plain, naked, smirking evil, isn’t it?

Well, anyway, it was decided th at nobody had the right to judge his own need or ability. We voted on it. Yes, ma’am, we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year. How else could it be done? Do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting? It took us just one meeti ng to discover that we had become beggars—rotten, whin ing, sniveling beggars, all of us, because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he had no rights and no earnings, his work didn’t belong to him, it belonged to ‘the family,’ and they owed him nothing in return, and the only claim he had on them was his ‘need’—so he had to beg in pub lic for relief from his needs, like any lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers and his wife’s head colds, hopi ng that ‘the family’ would throw him the alms. He had to claim miseries, be cause it’s miseries, not work, that had become the coin of the realm—so it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers, each claiming that his need was worse than his brother’s. How else could it be don e? Do you care to guess what happened, what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame, and what sort got away with the jackpot? “But that wasn’t all. There was some thing else that we discovered at the same meeting. The factory’s production had fallen by forty per cent, in that first half-year, so it was decided th at somebody hadn’t delivered ‘according to his ability.’ Who? How would you te ll it? ‘The family’ voted on that, too. They voted which men were the best, an d these men were sentenced to work overtime each night for the next six months. Overtime without pay—because you weren’t paid by time and you weren’t paid by work, only by need. “Do I have to tell you what happened after that—and into what sort of creatures we all started turning, we who had once been human? We began to hide whatever ability we had, to slow down and watch like hawks that we never worked any faster or better than the next fellow. What else could we do, when we knew that if we did our best for ‘the family,’ it’s not thanks or rewards that we’d get, but punishment? We knew that for every stinker who’d ruin a batch of motors and co st the company money—either through his sloppiness, because he didn’t have to care, or through plain incompetence—it’s we who’d have to pa y with our nights and our Sundays. So we did our best to be no good."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 84 “There was one young boy who started ou t, full of fire for the noble ideal, a bright kid without any schooling, but with a wonderful head on his shoulders. The first year, he figured out a work process that saved us thousands of man-hours. He gave it to ‘the family,’ didn’t ask anything for it, either, couldn’t ask, but that was all right with him. It was for the ideal, he said. But when he found himself voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work, because we hadn’t gotten enough from him, he shut his mouth and his brain. You can bet he didn’t come up with any ideas, the second year. “What was it they’d always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system, where men had to compet e for who’d do a better job than his fellows? Vicious, wasn’t it? Well, they should have seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for who’d do the worst job possible. There’s no surer way to destroy a man than to for ce him into a spot where he has to aim at not doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. That will finish him quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stick-ups for a living. But ther e was nothing else for us to do except to fake unfitness. The one accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability. Ability was like a mortgage on you that you could never pay off. And what was there to wo rk for? You knew that your basic pittance would be given to you anyway, whether you worked or not—your ‘housing and feeding allowance,’ it was called—an d above that pittance, you had no chance to get anything, no matter how hard you tried. You couldn’t count on buying a new suit of clothes next year —they might give you a ‘clothing allowance’ or they might not, according to whether nobody broke a leg, needed an operation or gave birth to more babies. And if there wasn’t enough money for new suits for everyb ody, then you couldn’t get yours, either. “There was one man who’d worked hard all his life, because he’d always wanted to send his son through colle ge. Well, the boy graduated from high school in the second year of the plan —but ‘the family’ wouldn’t give the father any ‘allowance’ for the college . They said his son couldn’t go to college, until we had enough to send ev erybody’s sons to college—and that we first had to send everybody’s child ren through high school, and we didn’t even have enough for that. The father died the following year, in a knife fight with somebody in a saloon, a fi ght over nothing in particular—such fights were beginning to happen among us all the time. “Then there was an old guy, a widow er with no family, who had one hobby: phonograph records.

Th e old guy who loved music, turned to drink, instead. He got so you never saw him fully conscious any more. But it seems like there was one thing he c ouldn’t forget. One night, he came staggering down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out. Every one of them. “Drink, of course, was what we all tu rned to, some more , some less. Don’t ask how we got the money for it. Wh en all the decent pleasures are forbidden, there’s always ways to ge t the rotten ones. You don’t break into grocery stores after dark and you don’ t pick your fellow’s pockets to buy classical symphonies or fishing tackle , but if it’s to get stinking drunk and forget—you do. Fishing tackle? Hunti ng guns? Snapshot cameras? Hobbies? There wasn’t any ‘amusement allo wance’ for anybody. ‘Amusement’ was the first thing they dropped. Aren’t yo u always supposed to be ashamed to object when anybody asks you to give up anything, if it’s something that gave you pleasure? Even our ‘tobacco a llowance’ was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a month—and this, they told us , was because the money had to go into the babies’ milk fund. Babies was the only item of production that didn’t fall, but rose and kept on rising—because people had nothing else to do, I guess, and because they didn’t have to care, the baby wasn’t their burden, it was ‘the family’s.’ In fact, the best chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier fo r a while was a ‘baby allowance.’ Either that, or a major disease. “It didn’t take us long to see how it all worked out. Any man who tried to play straight, had to refuse himself everything. He lost his taste for any pleasure, he hated to smoke a nickel’s worth of tobacco or chew a stick of gum, worrying whether somebody had more need for that nickel. He felt ashamed of every mouthful of food he swallowed, wondering whose weary nights of overtime had paid for it, knowing that his food was not his by right, miserably wishing to be cheated ra ther than to cheat, to be a sucker, but not a blood-sucker. He wouldn’t ma rry, he wouldn’t help his folks back home, he wouldn’t put an ex tra burden on ‘the family.’ Besides, if he still had some sort of sense of responsibility , he couldn’t marry or bring children into the world, when he could plan nothing, promise nothing, count on nothing.

They found more ways of getting in ‘need’ than the rest of us could ever imagine—they developed a special skill for it, which was the only ability they showed. “God help us, ma’am! Do you see what we saw? We saw that we’d been given a law to live by, a moral law, they called it, which punished those who observed it—for observing it. The more you tried to live up to it, the more you suffered; the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. Your honesty was like a tool left at the merc y of the next man’s dishonesty. The honest ones paid, the dishonest collected . The honest lost the dishonest won. How long could men stay good under this sort of law of goodness? We were a pretty decent bunch of fellows when we started. There weren’t many chiselers among us. We knew our jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in the country, where old man Starnes hired nothing but the pick of the country’s labor. Within one year under the new plan, there wasn’t an honest man left among us. That was the evil, the sort of hell-horror evil that preachers used to scare you with, but you never thought to see alive. Not that th e plan encouraged a few ba stards, but that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing else th at it could do—and it was called a moral ideal! “What was it we were supposed to want to work for? For the love of our brothers? What brothers? For the bums, the loafers, the moochers we saw all around us? And whether they were chea ting or plain incompetent whether they were unwilling or unable—what diffe rence did that make to us? If we were tied for life to the level of thei r unfitness, faked or real, how long could we care to go on? We had no way of knowing their ability, we had no way of controlling their needs—all we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in some sort of place that was half-hospital, half- stockyards—a place geared to nothing but disability, disaster, disease— beasts put there for the relief of whatever whoever chose to say was whichever’s need. “Love of our brothers? That’s when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time in our lives. We began to hate them for every meal they swallowed, for every small pleasure th ey enjoyed, for one man’s new shirt, for another’s wife’s hat, for an outing with their family, for a paint job on their house—it was taken from us, it wa s paid for by our privations, our denials, our hunger.

We began to have stool pigeons who informed on people, who reported that somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his family on some Sunday—which he’d paid for by gambling, most likely. We began to meddle into one another’s lives. We provoked family quarrels, to get somebody’s relatives thrown out. Any time we sa w a man starting to go steady with a girl, we made life miserable for him. We broke up many engagements. We didn’t want anyone to marry, we didn’t want any more dependents to feed. “In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used to chip in and help him out with the hosp ital bills, if he ha ppened to be hard- pressed for the moment. Now, if a baby was born, we didn’t speak to the parents for weeks. Babies, to us, had be come what locusts were to farmers. In the old days, we used to help a ma n if he had a bad illness in the family. Now—well, I’ll tell you about just one ca se. It was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years. She was a kindly old lady, cheerful and wise, she knew us all by our first name s and we all liked her—we used to like her. One day, she slipped on the cel lar stairs and fell and broke her hip. We knew what that meant at her age. The staff doctor said that she’d have to be sent to a hospital in town, for expe nsive treatments that would take a long time. The old lady died the night befo re she was to leave for town. They never established the cause of deat h. No, I don’t know whether she was murdered. Nobody said that. Nobody would talk about it at all. All I know is that I—and that’s what I can’t forget !—I, too, had caught myself wishing that she would die. This—may God fo rgive us!—was the brotherhood, the security, the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve for us! “Was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by anybody? Was there anybody who got any profit from it? There was. The Starnes heirs. I hope you’re not going to remind me that they’d sacrificed a fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift. We were fooled by that one, too. Yes, they gave up the factor y. But profit, ma’am, depends on what it is you’re after. And what the Starne s heirs were after, no money on earth could buy. Money is too clean and innocent for that. “Eric Starnes, the youngest—he was a jell yfish that didn’t have the guts to be after anything in particular.

We couldn’t stand him. “Gerald Starnes was our Director of Production. We ne ver learned just what the size of his rake-off—his alms —had been. It would have taken a staff of accountants to figure that out , and a staff of engineers to trace the way it was piped, directly or indirec tly, into his office. None of it was supposed to be for him—it was all fo r company expenses. Gerald had three cars, four secretaries, five telephones, and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no tax-paying tycoon in the country could have afforded. He spent more money in one year than his father had earned in profits in the last two years of his life. We saw a hundred-pound stack—a hundred pounds, we weighed them—of magazines in Gerald’s office, full of stories about our factory and our noble plan, wi th big pictures of Gerald Starnes, calling him a great social cr usader. Gerald liked to come into the shops at night, dressed in his formal clothes, fl ashing diamond cuff links the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes all over. Any cheap s how-off who’s got nothing to parade but his cash, is bad enough—except that he makes no bones about the cash being his, and you’re free to gape at him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don’t. But when a bastard like Gerald Starnes puts on an act and keeps spouting that he doesn’t care for material wealth, that he’s only serving ‘the family,’ that all the lushness is not for himself, but for our sake and for the common good, because it’s necessary to keep up the prestige of the company and of the nobl e plan in the eyes of the public— then that’s when you learn to hate the creature as you’ve never hated anything human. “But his sister Ivy was worse. She r eally did not care for material wealth. The alms she got was no bigger than ou rs, and she went about in scuffed, flat-heeled shoes and shirtwaists—just to show how selfless she was. She was our Director of Distribution. She was the lady in charge of our needs. She was the one who held us by the throat Of course, distribution was supposed to be decided by voting—by the voice of the people. But when the people are six thousand howling voices, tr ying to decide without yardstick, rhyme or reason, when there are no rule s to the game and each can demand anything, but has a right to nothi ng, when everybody holds power over everybody’s life except his own—then it turn s out, as it did, that the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. By the e nd of the second year, we dropped the pretense of the ‘family meetings’—in the name of ‘production efficiency and time economy,’ one meeting used to take ten days—and all the petitions of need were simply sent to Miss Star nes’ office. No, not sent. They had to be recited to her in person by ev ery petitioner. Then she made up a"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 89 distribution list, which she read to us for our vote of approval at a meeting that lasted three-quarters of an hour . We voted approval. There was a ten- minute period on the agenda for disc ussion and objections. We made no objections. We knew better by that tim e. Nobody can divide a factory’s income among thousands of people, without some sort of a gauge to measure people’s value. Her gauge wa s bootlicking. Selfless? In her father’s time, all of his money wouldn’t have given him a chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away with it, as she spok e to our best skilled workers and their wives. She had pale eyes that looked fi shy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil, you should have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man who’ d talked back to her once and who’d just heard his name on the list of those getting nothing above basic pittance. And when you saw it, you saw the real motive of any person who’s ever preached the slogan: ‘From each according to his abilit y, to each according to his need.’ “This was the whole secret of it. At fi rst, I kept wondering how it could be possible that the educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world could make a mistake of this size and pre ach, as righteousness, this sort of abomination—when five minutes of t hought should have told them what would happen if somebody tried to pr actice what they preached. Now I know that they didn’t do it by any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are never made innocently. If men fall for so me vicious piece of insanity, when they have no way to make it work a nd no possible reason to explain their choice—it’s because they have a reason th at they do not wish to tell. And we weren’t so innocent either, when we voted for that plan at the first meeting. We didn’t do it just because we belie ved that the drippy old guff they spewed was good. We had a nother reason, but the guff helped us to hide it from our neighbors and from ourselves. Th e guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue something that we’d be ashamed to admit otherwise. There wasn’t a man voting for it who didn’t th ink that under a setup of this kind he’d muscle in on the profits of the me n abler than himself. There wasn’t a man rich and smart enough but that he didn’t think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would give him a share of his better’s wealth and brain. But while he was thinking that he’d get unearned be nefits from the men above, he forgot about the men below who’d get unearned benefits, too. He forgot about all his inferiors who’d rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors. The worker who lik ed the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like his boss’s, forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come howling that their need entitled them to an icebox like his own. That was our real motive when we voted—that was the truth of it—but we"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 90 didn’t like to think it, so the less we lik ed it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common good. “Well, we got what we asked for. By the time we saw what it was that we’d asked for, it was too late. We we re trapped, with no place to go. The best men among us left the factory in th e first week of the plan. We lost our best engineers, superintendents, fore men and highest-skilled workers. A man of self-respect doesn’t turn into a mi lch cow for anybody. Some able fellows tried to stick it out, but they couldn’t take it for long. We kept losing our men, they kept escaping from the factory like from a pesthole—till we had nothing left except the men of need, but none of the men of ability. “And the few of us who were still an y good, but stayed on, were only those who had been there too long. In the old days, nobody ever quit the Twentieth Century—and, somehow, we couldn’t make ourselves believe that it was gone. After a while, we c ouldn’t quit, because no other employer would have us—for which I can’t blam e him. Nobody would deal with us in any way, no respectable person or fi rm. All the small shops, where we traded, started moving out of Starnesv ille fast—till we had nothing left but saloons, gambling joints and crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices. The alms we got kept falling, but the cost of our living went up. The list of the factory’s needy kept stretching, but th e list of its customers shrank. There was less and less income to divide am ong more and more people. In the old days, it used to be said that the Tw entieth Century Motor trademark was as good as the karat mark on gold. I don’t know what it was that the Starnes heirs thought, if they thought at all, but I suppose that like all social planners and like savages, they thought that th is trademark was a magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it would keep them rich, as it had kept their father. Well, when our customers began to see that we never delivered an order on time and neve r put out a motor that didn’t have something wrong with it—the magic stamp began to work the other way around: people wouldn’t take a motor as a gift, if it was marked Twentieth Century. And it came to where our only customers were me n who never paid and never meant to pay their bills. But Gerald Starnes, doped by his own publicity, got huffy and went around, w ith an air of moral superiority, demanding that businessmen place orders with us, not because our motors were good, but because we needed the orders so badly. “By that time, a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to notice. What goo d would our need do to a power plant when its generators stopped because of our defective engines? What good would it do to a man caught on an ope rating table when the electric light went out?

And if they bought our product, not because of its merit, but because of our need, would that be the good, the right, the moral thing to do for the owner of that power plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the maker of that plane? “Yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had wanted to establish all over the earth. If this is what it did in a single small town where we all knew one an other, do you care to think what it would do on a world scale? Do you care to imagine what it would be like, if you had to live and to work, when you’re tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe? To work—and whenever any men failed anywhere, it’s you who woul d have to make up for it.

To work—with no chance for an extra ration, till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians ha ve been sent through college. To work—on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom you’ll never see, whose needs you’ll never k now, whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question—just to work and work and work—and leave it up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the world to decide whose stomach w ill consume the effort, the dreams and the days of your life. And this is the moral law to accept? This —a moral ideal? Well, we tried it—and we learned. Our agony took four years, from our first meeting to our last, and it e nded the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. At our last m eeting, Ivy Starnes was the one who tried to brazen it out. She made a short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that the plan had failed because the rest of th e country had not accepted it, that a single community could not succeed in the midst of a selfish, greedy world—and that the plan was a noble id eal, but human nature was not good enough for it. A young boy—the one who ha d been punished for giving us a useful idea in our first year—got up, as we all sat silent, a nd walked straight to Ivy Starnes on the platform. He said nothing. He spat in her face. That was the end of the noble plan and of the Twentieth Century.” THE FORGOTTEN MAN OF SOCIALIZED MEDICINE This is the explanation given by a di stinguished brain surgeon of why he joined Galt’s strike.

That was what I would not place at th e disposal of men whose sole qualification to rule me was thei r capacity to spout the fraudulent generalities that got them elected to the privilege of enforcing their wishes at the point of a gun. I would not let them dictate the purpose for which my years of study had been spent, or the c onditions of my work, or my choice of patients, or the amount of my reward. I observed that in all the discussions that preceded the enslavement of me dicine, men discussed everything— except the desires of the doctors. Men considered only the ‘welfare’ of the patients, with no thought fo r those who were to provi de it. That a doctor should have any right, desi re or choice in the matter, was regarded as irrelevant selfishness; his is not to c hoose, they said, only ‘to serve.’ That a man who’s willing to work under compul sion is too dangerous a brute to entrust with a job in the stockyards— never occurred to those who proposed to help the sick by making life impo ssible for the healthy. I have often wondered at the smugness with which pe ople assert their right to enslave me, to control my work, to force my will, to violate my conscience, to stifle my mind—yet what is it that they expe ct to depend on, when they lie on an operating table under my hands? Their moral code has taught them to believe that it is safe to rely on the vi rtue of their victims. Well, that is the virtue I have withdrawn. Let them discover the kind of doctors that their system will now produce. Let them di scover, in their operating rooms and hospital wards, that it is not safe to place their lives in the hands of a man whose life they have throttled.

His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of hi s action. He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch—or build a cyclotron—without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To rema in alive, he must think. “But to think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call ‘human nature,’ the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness . Reason does not work automatically; thinking is not a mechanic al process; the connections of logic are not made by instinct. The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; the function of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are free to think or to evad e that effort. But you are not free to escape from your nature, from the fact that reason is your means of survival—so that for you , who are a human being, th e question ‘to be or not to be’ is the question ‘to think or not to think.’ “A being of volitional consciousness ha s no automatic course of behavior. He needs a code of values to guide hi s actions. ‘Value’ is that which one acts to gain and keep, ‘virtue’ is the action by which one gains and keeps it."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 98 ‘Value’ presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? ‘Value’ presupposes a standard, a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an alternative.

The existence of inanimate matter is unconditiona l, the existence of life is not: it depends on a spec ific course of action. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant a lternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemic al elements remain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that ma kes the concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil. “A plant must feed itself in order to live; the sunlight, the water, the chemicals it needs are the values its nature has set it to pursue; its life is the standard of value directing its actions . But a plant has no choice of action; there are alternatives in the conditio ns it encounters, but there is no alternative in its function: it acts automa tically to further its life, it cannot act for its own destruction. “An animal is equipped for sustaining it s life; its senses provide it with an automatic code of action, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil. It has no power to extend its k nowledge or to evade it. In conditions where its knowledge proves inadequate, it dies. But so long as it lives, it acts on its knowledge, with automatic safety and no power of choice, it is unable to ignore its own good, unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer. “Man has no automatic code of surviv al. His particular distinction from all other living species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means of volitional choice . He has no automatic knowledge of what is good for him or evil, what values his life depends on, what course of action it requires. Are you prattling about an in stinct of self-preservation? An instinct of self-preservation is precisely what man does not possess. An ‘instinct’ is an unerring and automatic form of knowle dge. A desire is not an instinct.

A plant that struggled to mangle its roots, a bird that fought to break its wings would not remain for long in the existence they affronted. But the history of man has been a struggle to deny and to destroy his mind. “Man has been called a rational bei ng, but rationality is a matter of choice—and the alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man—by choice; he has to hold his life as a value—by choice; he has to learn to su stain it—by choice; he has to discover the values it requires and pr actice his virtues—by choice. “A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality. “Whoever you are, you who are hearing me now, I am speaking to whatever living remnant is left uncorrupt ed within you, to the remnant of the human, to your mind , and I say: There is a mora lity of reason, a morality proper to man, and Man ’ s Life is its standard of value. “All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; all that which destroys it is the evil. “Man’s life, as required by his nature , is not the life of a mindless brute, of a looting thug or a mooching mystic, but the life of a thinking being—not life by means of force or fraud, but life by means of achievement—not survival at any price, since there’s only one price that pays for man’s survival: reason. “Man’s life is the standard of morality, but your own life is its purpose . If existence on earth is your goal, you must choose your actions and values by the standard of that which is proper to man—for the purpose of preserving, fulfilling and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life. “Since life requires a specific course of action, any other course will destroy it. A being who does not hold hi s own life as the motive and goal of his actions, is acting on the motive and standard of death . Such a being is a metaphysical monstrosity, struggling to oppose, negate an d contradict the fact of his own existence, running bl indly amuck on a trail of destruction, capable of nothing but pain. “Happiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death. Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one’s values.

They, who pose as scientists and claim that man is only an animal, do not grant him in clusion in the law of existence they have granted to the lowest of ins ects.

I told them, in essence, the statement I am making tonight. They were men who had lived by my code, but had not known how great a virtue it represented. I made them see it. I brought them, not a re-evaluation, but only an identification of their values. “We, the men of the mind, are now on st rike against you in the name of a single axiom, which is the root of our mo ral code, just as the root of yours is the wish to escape it: the axiom that existence exists . “Existence exists—and the act of gr asping that statement implies two corollary axioms: that something exis ts which one perceives and that one exists possessing consci ousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists. “If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a cont radiction in terms. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a c ontradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claim to perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness. “Whatever the degree of your knowle dge, these two—existence and consciousness—are axioms you cannot es cape, these two are the irreducible primaries implied in any action you undertake, in any part of your knowledge and in its sum, from the first ra y of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widest erudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape of a pebble or the stru cture of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it exists and that you know it. “To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of non- existence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature ma de of specific attributes. Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors—the greatest of your philosophers, has stated the formul a defining the concept of existence and the rule of all knowledge: A is A . A thing is itself. You have never grasped the meaning of his statement I am here to complete it: Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification. “Whatever you choose to consider, be it an object, an attribute or an action, the law of identity remains the same.

Reason is the facu lty that perceives, identifies and integrates the material provided by his se nses. The task of his senses is to give him the evidence of existence, but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason, his senses tell him only that something is , but what it is must be learned by his mind. “All thinking is a process of identifi cation and integrati on. Man perceives a blob of color; by integr ating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he learns to identify it as a solid object; he learns to identify the object as a table; he learns that the table is ma de of wood; he learns that the wood consists of cells, that the cells cons ist of molecules, that the molecules consist of atoms. All through this pro cess, the work of his mind consists of answers to a single question: What is it? His means to establish the truth of his answers is logic, and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification . A contradiction cannot exist. An atom is itself, and so is the uni verse; neither can contradict its own identity; nor can a part contradict the whole. No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge. To arrive at a contradictio n is to confess an error in one’s thinking; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one’s mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality. “Reality is that which exists; the un real does not exist; the unreal is merely that negation of existence which is the content of a human consciousness when it attempts to abandon reason. Truth is the recognition of reality; reason, man’s only means of knowledge, is his only standard of truth. “The most depraved sentence y ou can now utter is to ask: Whose reason?

You may make an error at any step of it, with nothing to protect you but your own severity, or you may try to cheat, to fake the evidence and evade the effort of the quest—but if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assume s the responsibility of thinking. “That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, and that which you call ‘free will’ is your mind’ s freedom to think or not, the only will you have, your only freedom, the choi ce that controls all the choices you make and determines your life and your character. “Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And his basic vice, the source of all hi s evils, is that nameless act which all of you practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful suspension of one’s consci ousness, the refusal to think—not blindness, but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but th e refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment—on the unsta ted premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict ‘It is .’ Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, an attempt to wipe out reality. But existence exists; reality is not to be wiped out, it will me rely wipe out the wiper. By refusing to say ‘It is,’ you are refusing to say ‘I am.’ By suspending your judgment, you are negating your pers on. When a man declares: ‘Who am I to know?’—he is declaring: ‘Who am I to live?’ “This, in every hour and every issue, is your basic moral choice: thinking or non-thinking, existence or non-ex istence, A or non-A, entity or zero. “To the extent to which a man is rati onal, life is the premise directing his actions. To the extent to which he is irrational, the premise directing his actions is death."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 104 “You who prattle that morality is so cial and that man would need no morality on a desert island—it is on a desert island that he would need it most.

But a ‘moral commandment’ is a contradiction in terms. The moral is the chosen, not the forced; the understood, not the obeyed. The moral is the rational, and reason accepts no commandments. “My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existence exists—and in a single choi ce: to live. The rest proceeds from these. To live, man must hold three th ings as the supreme and ruling values of his life: Reason—Purpose—Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve—Self-esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is wo rthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three values im ply and require all of man’s virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the re lation of existence and consciousness: rationality, independence, in tegrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, pride. “Rationality is the recognition of the fact that existe nce exists, that nothing can alter the truth and nothing ca n take precedence over that act of perceiving it, which is thinking—that the mind is one’s only judge of values and one’s only guide of action—that re ason is an absolute that permits no compromise—that a concession to the irrational invalidates one’s consciousness and turns it from the task of perceiving to the task of faking reality—that the alleged short-cut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short-circuit destroying the mind—that the acceptance of a mystical invention is a wish for the annih ilation of existence and, properly, annihilates one’s consciousness. “Independence is the recognition of the fa ct that yours is the responsibility of judgment and nothing can help you escape it—th at no substitute can do your thinking, as no pinch-hitter can liv e your life—that the vilest form of self-abasement and self-destruction is the subordination of your mind to the mind of another, the acceptance of an authority over your brain, the acceptance of his assertions as facts, his say-so as truth, his edicts as

convictions to the wishes of others, be it the whole of mankind shouting pleas or threats against him—that courage and confidence are practical necessities, that courage is the practical form of being true to existence, of being true to truth, a nd confidence is the practical form of being true to one’s own consciousness. “Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have no value, that neither love nor fa me nor cash is a value if obtained by fraud—that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an act of raising your victims to a po sition

you have to dread and flee—that you do not care to live as a dependent, least of all a dependent on the stupidity of others, or as a fool whose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling—that honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrifice fo r the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice: his refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence

His own happiness is man’s only moral purpose, but only his own virtue can achieve it. Virtue is not an end in its elf. Virtue is not its own reward or sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil. Life is the reward of virtue—and happiness is the goal and the reward of life. “Just as your body has tw o fundamental sensations, pleasure and pain, as signs of its welfare or injury, as a baro meter of its basic alternative, life or death, so your consciousness has two fundamental emotions, joy and suffering, in answer to the same altern ative.

Happiness is not the satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly attempt to indulge. Happiness is a state of non-contradictory joy—a joy without penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of your values and does not work for your own destruction, not the joy of escaping from your mind, but of using your mind’s fu llest power, not the joy of faking reality, but of achieving values that are real, not the joy of a drunkard, but of a producer. Happiness is possible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions. “Just as I support my life, neither by robbery nor alms, but by my own effort, so I do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others, but earn it by my own achieveme nt. Just as I do not consider the pleasure of others as the goal of my life, so I do not consider my pleasure as the goal of the lives of others. Just as there are no contradictions in my values and no conflicts among my desi res—so there are no victims and no conflicts of interest among rationa l men, men who do not desire the unearned and do not view one anothe r with a cannibal’s lust, men who neither make sacrifices nor accept them. “The symbol of all relationships am ong such men, the moral symbol of respect for human beings, is the trader . We, who live by values, not by loot, are traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the unde served. A trader does not ask to be paid for his failures, nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws. A trader does not squander his body as fodder or his soul as alms. Just as he does not give his work except in trade for material va lues, so he does not give the values of his spirit—his love, his friendship, his esteem—except in payment and in trade for human virtues, in payment for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout the ages, rev iled the traders and held them in contempt, while honoring the beggars and the looters, have known the secret motive of their sneers: a trader is the entity they dread—a man of justice. “Do you ask what moral obligation I owe to my fellow men? None— except the obligation I owe to myself, to material objects and to all of existence: rationality. I deal with men as my nature and theirs demands: by means of reason.

The only va lue men can offer me is the work of their mind. When I disagree with a rati onal man, I let reality be our final arbiter; if I am right, he will learn; if I am wrong, I will; one of us will win, but both will profit. “Whatever may be open to disagreement, there is one act of evil that may not, the act that no man may commit against others and no man may sanction or forgive. So long as men desire to live together, no man may initiate —do you hear me? no man may start —the use of physical force against others. “To interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his perception of reality, is to negate a nd paralyze his means of survival; to force him to act against his own judgmen t, is like forcing him to act against his own sight. Whoever, to whatever purpose or extent, initiates the use of force, is a killer acting on the prem ise of death in a manner wider than murder: the premise of destroying man’s capacity to live. “Do not open your mouth to tell me that your mind has convinced you of your right to force my mind. Force and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun begins. When you declare that men are irrational animals and propose to treat them as such, you de fine thereby your own character and can no longer claim the sanction of r eason—as no advocate of contradictions can claim it. There can be no ‘right’ to destroy the source of rights, the only means of judging right and wrong: the mind. “To force a man to drop his own mind and to accept your will as a substitute, with a gun in place of a syll ogism, with terror in place of proof, and death as the final argument—is to at tempt to exist in defiance of reality. Reality demands of man that he act for his own rational interest; your gun demands of him that he act against it. Reality threatens man with death if he does not act on his rational judgment; you threaten him with death if he does. You place him in a world where the price of his life is the surrender of all the virtues required by life—an d death by a process of gradual destruction is all that you and your system will achie ve, when death is made to be the ruling power, the winning argument in a society of men. “Be it a highwayman who confronts a traveler with the ultimatum: ‘Your money or your life,’ or a politician who confronts a country with the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 110 ultimatum: ‘Your children’s education or your life,’ the meaning of that ultimatum is: ‘Your mind or your lif e’—and neither is possible to man without the other. “If there are degrees of evil, it is hard to say who is the more contemptible: the brute who assumes the right to force the mind of others or the moral degenerate who grants to others the right to force his mind. That is the moral absolute one does not leav e open to debate. I do not grant the terms of reason to men who propose to deprive me of reason. I do not enter discussions with neighbors who think they can forbid me to think. I do not place my moral sanction upon a murdere r’s wish to kill me. When a man attempts to deal with me by fo rce, I answer him—by force. “It is only as retaliation that for ce may be used and only against the man who starts its use. No, I do not share his evil or sink to his concept of morality: I merely grant him his choice, destruction, the only destruction he had the right to choose: his own. He us es force to seize a value; I use it only to destroy destruction. A holdup man se eks to gain wealth by killing me; I do not grow richer by killing a holdup man. I seek no values by means of evil, nor do I surrender my values to evil. “In the name of all the producers who had kept you alive and received your death ultimatums in payment, I now answer you with a single ultimatum of our own: Our work or your guns. You can choose either; you can’t have both. We do not initiate the use of force against others or submit to force at their hands. If you desire ever again to live in an industrial society, it will be on our moral terms. Our terms and our motive power are the antithesis of yours. You have been using fear as your weapon and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality. We offer him life as his reward for accepting ours. “You who are worshippers of the ze ro—you have never discovered that achieving life is not the equivalent of a voiding death. Joy is not ‘the absence of pain,’ intelligence is not ‘the absence of stupidity,’ light is not ‘the absence of darkness,’ an entity is not ‘the absence of a nonentity.’ Building is not done by abstaining from demolition; centuries of sitting and waiting in such abstinence will not raise one sing le girder for you to abstain from demolishing—and now you can no longer say to me, the builder; ‘Produce, and feed us in exchange for our not destroying your pr oduction.’ I am answering in the name of all your victim s: Perish with and in your own void.

Stop running, for once—there is no place to run—stand naked, as you dread to stand, but as I see you, and take a look at what you dared to call a moral code. “Damnation is the start of your morality , destruction is its purpose, means and end. Your code begins by damning man as evil, then demands that he practice a good which it defines as im possible for him to practice. It demands, as his first proof of virt ue, that he accept his own depravity without proof. It demands that he start, not with a standard of value, but with a standard of evil, which is himself, by means of which he is then to define the good: the good is that which he is not. “It does not matter who then becomes the profiteer on his renounced glory and tormented soul, a mystic God with some incomprehensible design or any passer-by whose rotting so res are held as some inexplicable claim upon him—it does not matter, the good is not for him to understand, his duty is to crawl through years of penance, atoning for the guilt of his existence to any stray collector of unintelligible debts, his only concept of a value is a zero: the good is that which is non-man. “The name of this monstrous absurdity is Original Sin. “A sin without volition is a slap at mo rality and an insolent contradiction in terms: that which is outside the possibility of choice is outside the province of morality. If man is evil by birth, he has no will, no power to change it; if he has no will, he can be neither good nor evil; a robot is amoral.

To hold him guilty in a matter where no innocence exists is a mockery of reason. To destroy morality, nature, ju stice and reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched. Yet that is the root of your code. “Do not hide behind the cowardly evasion that man is born with free will, but with a tendency to evil. A free will saddled with a tendency is like a game with loaded dice. It forces man to struggle through the effort of playing, to bear responsibility and pa y for the game, but the decision is weighted in favor of a tendency that he had no power to escape. If the tendency is of his choice, he cannot possess it at both; if it is not of his choice, his will is not free. “What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call his Original Sin? What are the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection? Their myth declares th at he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge—he acquired a mind and became a rationa l being. It was the knowledge of good and evil—he became a moral being. He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor—he became a productive being. He was sentenced to experience desire—h e acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment The evils for which they damn him are reason, morality, creativeness, joy—all the cardinal values of his existence. It is not his vices that their myth of man’s fall is designe d to explain and condemn, it is not his errors that they hold as his guilt, bu t the essence of his nature as man.

A body without a soul is a corpse, a soul without a body is a ghost—yet such is their image of man’s nature: the battleground of a struggle between a corpse and a ghost, a corpse endowed with some evil volition of its own and a ghost endowed with the knowledge that everything known to man is non-existent, that only the unknowable exists. “Do you observe what human faculty that doctrine was designed to ignore? It was man’s mind that had to be negated in order to make him fall apart. Once he surrendered reason, he was left at th e mercy of two monsters whom he could not fat hom or control: of a body moved by unaccountable instincts and a soul moved by mystic revelations—he was left as the passively ravaged victim of a battle between a robot and a Dictaphone. “And as he now crawls through the wreckage, groping blindly for a way to live, your teachers offer him the he lp of a morality that proclaims that he’ll find no solution and must seek no fulfillment on earth. Real existence, they tell him, is that which he cannot perceive, true consciousness is the faculty of perceiving the non-existent —and if he is unabl e to understand it, that is the proof that his existence is evil and his consciousness impotent. “As products of the split between ma n’s soul and body, there are two kinds of teachers of the Morality of Death: the mystics of spirit and the mystics of muscle, whom you call the spir itualists and the materialists, those who believe in consciousness without existence and those who believe in existence without consciousness.

Sacrifice —cry both—is the essence of morality, the highest virtue within man’s reach. “Whoever is now within reach of my voice, whoever is man the victim, not man the killer, I am speaking at th e deathbed of your mind, at the brink of that darkness in which you’re drow ning, and if there still remains within you the power to struggle to hold on to those fading sparks which had been yourself—use it now. The word that has destroyed you is ‘ sacrifice .’ Use the last of your strength to understand its meaning. You ’re still alive. You have a chance. “ ‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the reject ion of the worthless, but of the precious. ‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the re jection of the evil for the sake of the good, but of the good for the sake of the evil. ‘Sacrifice’ is the surrender of that which you value in favor of that which you don’t. “If you exchange a penny for a dollar, it is not a sacrifice; if you exchange a dollar for a penny, it is . If you achieve the career you wanted, after years of struggle, it is not a sacrifice; if you then renounce it for the sake of a rival, it is. If you own a bottle of milk and give it to your star ving child, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to your nei ghbor’s child and let your own die, it is . “If you give money to help a friend, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to a worthless stranger, it is . If you give your friend a sum you can afford, it is not a sacrifice; if you give him money at the cost of your own discomfort, it is only a partial virtue, according to this sort of moral standard; if you give him money at the cost of disaster to yourself— that is the virtue of sacrifice in full. “If you renounce all personal desires and dedicate your life to those you love, you do not achieve full virtue: yo u still retain a value of your own, which is your love. If you devote your lif e to random strangers, it is an act of greater virtue.

You cannot achieve it so long as you live, but the value of your life and of your person is gauged by how closely you succeed in approaching that ideal zero which is death . “If you start, however, as a passionless blank, as a vegetable seeking to be eaten, with no values to reject and no wishes to renounce, you will not win the crown of sacrifice. It is not a sacr ifice to renounce the unwanted. It is not a sacrifice to give your life for others , if death is your personal desire. To achieve the virtue of sacrifice, you mu st want to live, you must love it, you must burn with passion for this earth and for all the splendor it can give you—you must feel the twist of every knife as it slashes your desires away from your reach and drains your love out of your body. It is not mere death that the morality of sacrifice holds ou t to you as an ideal, but death by slow torture. “Do not remind me that it pertains only to this life on earth. I am concerned with no othe r. Neither are you. “If you wish to save the last of your dignity, do not call your best actions a ‘sacrifice’: that term brands you as immoral. If a mother buys food for her hungry child rather than a hat for herself, it is not a sacrifice: she values the child higher than the hat; but it is a s acrifice to the kind of mother whose higher value is the hat, who would pref er her child to starve and feeds him only from a sense of duty. If a man dies fighting for his own freedom, it is not a sacrifice: he is not willing to live as a slave; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of man who’s willing. If a man re fuses to sell his convictions, it is not a sacrifice, unless he is the sort of man who has no convictions. “Sacrifice could be proper only for t hose who have nothing to sacrifice— no values, no standards, no judgment— those whose desires are irrational whims, blindly conceived and lightly surrendered. For a man of moral stature, whose desires are born of ratio nal values, sacrifice is the surrender of the right to the wrong, of the good to the evil. “The creed of sacrifice is a mora lity for the immoral—a morality that declares its own bankruptcy by confessing that it can’t impart to men any personal stake in virtues or values, and that their souls are sewers of depravity, which they must be taught to sacrifice.

And what do you think are material values? Matter has no value ex cept as a means for the satisfaction of human desires. Matter is only a tool of human values. To what service are you asked to give the material tools your virtue has produced? To the service of that which you regard as evil: to a principle you do not share, to a person you do not respect, to the achievement of a purpose opposed to your own— else your gift is not a sacrifice. “Your morality tells you to renounce th e material world and to divorce your values from matter. A man whose values are given no expression in material form, whose existence is unr elated to his ideals, whose actions contradict his convictions, is a cheap little hypocrite—yet that is the man who obeys your morality and divorces hi s values from matter. The man who loves one woman, but sleeps with anot her—the man who admires the talent of a worker, but hires another—the man who considers one cause to be just, but donates his money to the support of another—the man who holds high standards of craftsmanship, but devot es his effort to the production of trash— these are the men who have renounced matter, the men who believe that the values of their spirit ca nnot be brought into material reality. “Do you say it is the spirit that such men have renounced? Yes, of course. You cannot have one without the other. You are an indivisible entity of matter and consciousness. Renounce your consciousness and you become a brute. Renounce your body and you beco me a fake. Renounce the material world and you surrender it to evil. “And that is precisely the goal of your morality, the duty that your code demands of you. Give to that which you do not enjoy, serve that which you do not admire, submit to that which yo u consider evil—surrender the world to the values of others, deny, reject, renounce your self . Your self is your mind ; renounce it and you become a chunk of meat ready for any cannibal to swallow. “It is your mind that they want you to surrender—all those who preach the creed of sacrifice, whatev er their tags or their mo tives, whether they demand it for the sake of your soul or of your body, whether they promise you another life in heaven or a full stomach on this earth.

You need no proof, no reasons, no success, you need not achieve in fact the good of others—all you need to know is that your motive was the good of others, not your own. Your only definition of the good is a negation: the good is the ‘non-good for me.’ “Your code—which boasts that it uph olds eternal, absolute, objective moral values and scorns the conditio nal, the relative and the subjective— your code hands out, as its version of the absolute, the following rule of moral conduct: If you wish it, it’s evil; if others wish it, it’s good; if the motive of your action is your welfare, don’t do it; if th e motive is the welfare of others, then anything goes. “As this double-jointed, double-standard morality sp lits you in half, so it splits mankind into two enemy camps: one is you , the other is all the rest of humanity. You are the only outcast who has no right to wish or live. You are the only servant, the rest are the masters, you are the only giver, the rest are the takers, you are the eternal debtor, the rest are the creditors never to be paid off. You must not question their right to your sacrifice, or the nature of their wishes and their needs: their right is conferred upon them by a negative, by the fact th at they are ‘non-you.’ “For those of you who might ask questions, your code provides a consolation prize and booby-trap: it is for your own happiness, it says, that you must serve the happiness of others, the only way to achieve your joy is to give it up to others, the only way to achieve your prosperity is to surrender your wealth to others, the only way to protect your life is to protect all men except yourself—and if you find no joy in this procedure, it is your own fault and the proof of your evil; if you were g ood, you would find your happiness in providing a banquet for othe rs, and your dignity in existing on such crumbs as they might care to toss you."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Ayn Rand – FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL 118 “You who have no standard of self-esteem, accep t the guilt and dare not ask the questions.

You know it, not in honest statement, but as a dark uneasiness within you, while you flounder between guiltily cheating and grudgingly practicing a principle too vicious to name. “I, who do not accept the unearned, neither in values nor in guilt , am here to ask the questions you evaded. Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others, but not your own? If enjoyment is a value, why is it moral when experienced by others, but immora l when experienced by you?

Why is it immoral for you to desire, but mo ral for others to do so? Why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it, but moral to give it away? And if it is not moral for you to keep a value, w hy is it moral for others to accept it? If you are selfless and virtuous when you give it, are they not selfish and vicious when they take it? Does virtue consist of serving vice? Is the moral purpose of those who are good, self-imm olation for the sake of those who are evil? “The answer you evade, the monstrous answer is: No, the takers are not evil, provided they did not earn the value you gave them. It is not immoral for them to accept it, provided they are unable to produce it, unable to deserve it, unable to give you any value in return. It is not immoral for them to enjoy it, provided they do not obtain it by right . “Such is the secret core of your creed, the other half of your double standard: it is immoral to live by you r own effort, but moral to live by the effort of others—it is immoral to consume your own product, but moral to consume the products of others—it is immoral to earn, but moral to mooch—it is the parasites who are the moral justification for the existence of the producers, but the existence of th e parasites is an end in itself—it is evil to profit by achievement, but good to profit by sacrifice—it is evil to create your own happiness, but good to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others. “Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by opposite rules: those who may desire anything and thos e who may desire nothing, the chosen and the damned, th e riders and the carriers, the eaters and the eaten.

Whether your fa ilure is just or not, whether your wishes are rational or not, whether yo ur misfortune is undeserved or the result of your vices, it is misfortune that gives you a right to rewards. It is pain , regardless of its nature or cause, pain as a primary absolute, that gives you a mortgage on all of existence. “If you heal your pain by your own effort, you receive no moral credit: your code regards it scornfully as an act of self-interest. Whatever value you seek to acquire, be it wealth or food or love or rights, if you acquire it by means of your virtue, your code does no t regard it as a moral acquisition: you occasion no loss to anyone, it is a trade, not alms; a payment, not a sacrifice. The deserved belongs in the selfish, co mmercial realm of mutual profit; it is only the undeserved that calls for that moral transaction which consists of profit to one at the price of disaster to the other. To demand rewards for your virtue is se lfish and immoral; it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand into a moral right. “A morality that holds need as a claim, holds emptiness—non-existence— as its standard of value; it rewards an absence , a defect: weakness, inability, incompetence, suffering, disease, disast er, the lack, the fault, the flaw—the zero . “Who provides the account to pay thes e claims? Those w ho are cursed for being non-zeros, each to the extent of his distance from that ideal. Since all values are the product of virtues, the degree of your virtue is used as the measure of your penalty; the degree of your faults is used as the measure of your gain.

Do you wonder at the meanness of soul in those you see around you? The man who achieves these virtues will not accept your moral code; the man who accepts your moral code will not achieve these virtues. “Under a morality of sacrifice, the fi rst value you sacrifice is morality; the next is self-esteem.

You hate the man who has a dollar more than you, that dollar is ri ghtfully yours, he makes you feel that you are morally defrauded. The man below is a source of your guilt, the man above is a source of your fr ustration. You do not kn ow what to surrender or demand, when to give and when to grab , what pleasure in life is rightfully yours and what debt is still unpaid to others—you struggle to evade, as ‘theory,’ the knowledge that by the moral standard you’ve accepted you are guilty every moment of your life, ther e is no mouthful of food you swallow that is not needed by someone somewhere on earth—and you give up the problem in blind resentment, you conclude that moral perfection is not to be achieved or desired , that you will muddle through by snatching as snatch can and by avoiding the eyes of the yo ung, of those who look at you as if self-esteem were possible and they expe cted you to have it. Guilt is all that you retain within your soul—and so doe s every other man, as he goes past, avoiding your eyes. Do you wonder why your morality has not achieved brotherhood on earth or the good will of man to man? “The justification of sacrifice, that your morality propounds, is more corrupt than the corruption it purpor ts to justify. The motive of your sacrifice, it tells you, should be love —the love you ought to feel for every man. A morality that professes the belief that the values of the spirit are more precious than matter, a morality that teaches you to scorn a whore who gives her body indiscriminate ly to all men—this same morality demands that you surrender your soul to promiscuous love for all comers. “As there can be no causeless wealth, so there can be no causeless love or any sort of causeless emotion. An emo tion is a response to a fact of reality, an estimate dictated by your standards. To love is to value .

Your morality demands that you divorce your love from values and hand it down to any vagrant, not as res ponse to his worth, but as response to his need , not as reward, but as alms, not as a payment for virtues, but as a blank check on vices. Your morality tells you that the purpose of love is to set you free of the bonds of morality, that love is superior to moral judgment, that true love transcends, forgives and survives every manner of evil in its object, and the greater the love the greater the depravity it permits to the loved. To love a man for his vi rtues is paltry and human, it tells you; to love him for his flaws is divine. To love those who are worthy of it is self- interest; to love the unworthy is sacr ifice. You owe your love to those who don’t deserve it, and the less they dese rve it, the more love you owe them— the more loathsome the object, the nobl er your love—the more unfastidious your love, the greater your virtue—and if you can bring your soul to the state of a dump heap that welcomes anything on equal terms, if you can cease to value moral values, you have achieved the state of moral perfection. “Such is your morality of sacrifice and such are the twin ideals it offers: to refashion the life of your body in the image of a human stockyard, and the life of your spirit in the image of a dump. “Such was your goal—and you’ve reached it. Why do you now moan complaints about man’s impotence an d the futility of human aspirations? Because you were unable to prosper by seeking destruction? Because you were unable to find joy by worshippin g pain?

Somewhere in th e distant reaches of his childhood, when his own understanding of reality cl ashed with the assertions of others, with their arbitrary orders and contra dictory demands, he gave in to so craven a fear of independence that he renounced his rational faculty. At the crossroads of the choice between ‘I know’ and ‘They sa y,’ he chose the authority of others, he chose to s ubmit rather than to understand, to believe rather than to think. Faith in the supernatural begins as faith in the superiority of others. His surrender took the form of the feeling that he must hide his lack of understanding, that others possess some mysterious knowledge of which he alone is deprived, that reality is whatever they want it to be, through some mean s forever denied to him. “From then on, afraid to think, he is left at the mercy of unidentified feelings.

A mystic is driven by the urge to impress, to cheat, to flatter, to deceive, to force that omnipotent consciousness of others. ‘ They ’ are his only key to reality, he feels th at he cannot exist save by harnessing their mysterious power and extorting their unaccountable consent. ‘ They ’ are his only means of perception and, like a blind man who depends on the sight of a dog, he feels he must leash them in order to live. To control the consciousness of others b ecomes his only passion; power-lust is a weed that grows only in the vacant lots of an abandoned mind. “Every dictator is a mystic, and ev ery mystic is a potential dictator. A mystic craves obedience from men, not their agreement. He wants them to surrender their consciousness to his asse rtions, his edicts, his wishes, his whims—as his consciousness is surrendered to th eirs. He wants to deal with men by means of faith and for ce—he finds no satisfaction in their consent if he must earn it by means of facts and reason. Reason is the enemy he dreads and, simultaneously, considers precarious ; reason, to him, is a means of deception; he feels that men possess some power more potent than reason— and only their causeless belief or their forced obedience can give him a sense of security, a proof that he has gained control of the mystic endowment he lacked. His lust is to command, not to convince: conviction requires an act of independence and rests on the absolute of an objective reality. What he seeks is power over reality and over men’s means of perceiving it, their mind, the power to interpose his will between existence and consciousness, as if, by agreeing to fake the reality he orders them to fake, men would, in fact, create it. “Just as the mystic is a parasite in matter, who expropr iates the wealth created by others—just as he is a para site in spirit, who plunders the ideas created by others—so he falls below th e level of a lunatic who creates his own distortion of reality, to the level of a parasite of lunacy who seeks a distortion created by others. “There is only one state that fulfills the mystic’s longing for infinity, non- causality, non-identity: death .

The less you felt, the louder you proclaimed your selfless love and servitude to others, in dread of ever letting them discover your own self, the se lf that you betrayed, the self that you kept in concealment, like a skelet on in the closet of your body. And they, who were at once your dupes an d your deceivers, they listened and voiced their loud approval, in dread of ever letting you discover that they were harboring the same unspoken secret. Existence among you is a giant pretense, an act you all perform for one a nother, each feeling that he is the only guilty freak, each placing his mora l authority in the unknowable known only to others, each faking the reality he feels they expect him to fake, none having the courage to break the vicious circle. “No matter what dishonorable co mpromise you’ve made with your impracticable creed, no matter what mi serable balance, half-cynicism, half- superstition, you now manage to maintain, you still preserve the root, the lethal tenet: the belief that the moral and the practical ar e opposites.

And in that fog of switching definitions which des cends upon a frozen mind, you have forgotten that the evils damned by your creed were the virtues required for living, and you have come to be lieve that actual evils are the practical means of existence. Forgetting that th e impractical ‘good’ was self-sacrifice, you believe that self-esteem is impractical ; forgetting that the practical ‘evil’ was production, you believe th at robbery is practical. “Swinging like a helpless branch in the wind of an uncharted moral wilderness, you dare not fully to be evil or fully to live.

You feel disarmed when you come up against a scoundrel: you believe that evil is bound to win, since the moral is the impotent, the impractical . “Morality, to you, is a phantom scar ecrow made of duty, of boredom, of punishment, of pain, a cross-breed betw een the first schoolteacher of your past and the tax collector of your pr esent, a scarecrow standing in a barren field, waving a stick to chase away your pleasures—and pleasure , to you, is a liquor-soggy brain, a mindless slut, th e stupor of a moron who stakes his cash on some animal’s race, sin ce pleasure cannot be moral. “If you identify your actual belief, you will find a trip le damnation—of yourself, of life, of virtue—in the grot esque conclusion you have reached: you believe that morality is a necessary evil. “Do you wonder why you live without di gnity, love without fire and die without resistance?

A moral code impossible to practice, a code that demands imperfection or death, has taught you to dissolve all ideas in fog, to permit no firm definitions, to regard any concept as approximate and any rule of conduct as elastic, to hedge on any principle, to compromise on any value, to take the middle of any ro ad. By extorting your acceptance of supernatural absolutes, it has forced you to reject the absolute of nature.

No value is higher than self-esteem, but you’ve invested it in counterfeit securities—and now your morality has caught you in a trap where you are forced to protect your se lf-esteem by fighting for the creed of self-destruction.

To escape it—if he’s chosen an irrational standard—he will fake, evade, blank out; he will cheat himself of reality, of existence, of happiness, of mind; and he will ultimat ely cheat himself of self-esteem by struggling to preserve its illusion rather than to risk discovering its lack. To fear to face an issue is to believe that the worst is true. “It is not any crime you ha ve ever committed that infects your soul with permanent guilt, it is none of your failures, erro rs or flaws, but the blank-out by which you attempt to evade them—it is not any sort of Original Sin or unknown prenatal deficiency, but the knowledge and fact of your basic default, of suspending yo ur mind, of refusing to think. Fear and guilt are your chronic emotions, they are real and you do deserv e them, but they don’t come from the superficial reasons you invent to disguise their cause, not from your ‘selfishness,’ weakness or i gnorance, but from a real and basic threat to your existence: fear , because you have aba ndoned your weapon of survival, guilt , because you know you have done it volitionally. “The self you have betrayed is your mind; self-esteem is reliance on one’s power to think.

An error of know ledge is not a moral flaw, provided you are willing to correct it; only a mystic would judge human beings by the standard of an impossible, automatic omniscience. But a breach of morality is the conscious choice of an action you know to be evil, or a willful evasion of knowledge, a suspension of sight a nd of thought.

We will rebuild America’s system on the moral premise which had been its foundation, but which you treated as a guilty underground, in your frantic evasion of the conflict between that premise and your mystic morality: the premise that man is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others, that man’s life, his freedom, his happiness are his by inalienable right “You who’ve lost the concept of a right, you who swing in impotent evasiveness between the claim that right s are a gift of God, a supernatural gift to be taken on faith, or the claim th at rights are a gift of society, to be broken at its arbitrary whim—the source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the law of id entity.

If life on ear th is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature forbids him the irrational. Any grou p, any gang, any nation that attempts to negate man’s rights, is wrong , which means: is evil, which means: is anti-life. “ Rights are a moral concept—and morality is a matter of choice. Men are free not to choose man’s survival as th e standard of their morals and their laws, but not free to escape from the fa ct that the alternative is a cannibal society, which exists for a while by de vouring its best and collapses like a cancerous body, when the healthy have been eaten by the diseased, when the rational have been consumed by the irra tional. Such has been the fate of your societies in history, but you’ve evaded the knowledge of the cause. I am here to state it: the agent of retr ibution was the law of identity, which you cannot escape. Just as man cannot liv e by means of the irrational, so two men cannot, or two thousand, or two bi llion. Just as man can’t succeed by defying reality, so a nation can’t, or a co untry, or a globe. A is A. The rest is a matter of time, provided by the generosity of victims. “Just as man can’t exist without his body, so no rights can exist without the right to translate one’s rights into reality—to think, to work and to keep the results—which means: the right of property. The modern mystics of muscle who offer you the fraudulent alternative of ‘human rights’ versus ‘property rights,’ as if one could exis t without the other, are making a last, grotesque attempt to revive the doctrin e of soul versus body. Only a ghost can exist without material property; onl y a slave can work with no right to the product of his effort. The doctrine that ‘human rights’ are superior to ‘property rights’ simply means that some human be ings have the right to make property out of others; since the competent have nothing to gain from the incompetent, it means the right of the incompetent to own their betters and to use them as productive cattle. Whoever regards this as human and right, has no right to the title of ‘human.’ “The source of property rights is the law of causality. All property and all forms of wealth are produced by ma n’s mind and labor. As you cannot have effects without causes, so you cannot have wealth without its source: without intelligence. You cannot force intelligence to work: those who’re able to think, will not work under compulsion; those who will, won’t produce much more than the price of the whip needed to keep them enslaved. You cannot obtain the produc ts of a mind except on the owner’s terms, by trade and by volitional consen t.

A proper government is only a policeman, acting as an agent of man’s self-defense, and, as such, may resort to force only against those who start the use of force. The only proper functions of a gove rnment are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others, to settle disputes by rational rules, according to objective law. But a government that initiates the employment of force against men who had forced no one, the employment of armed compulsion against disarmed victims, is a nightmare infernal machine designed to annihi late morality: such a government reverses its only moral purpose and switche s from the role of protector to the role of man’s deadliest enemy, from the role of policeman to the role of a criminal vested with the right to th e wielding of violence against victims deprived of the right of self-defen se. Such a government substitutes for morality the following rule of soci al conduct: you may do whatever you please to your neighbor, provided your gang is bigger than his. “Only a brute, a fool or an evader can agree to exist on such terms or agree to give his fellow men a blank ch eck on his life and hi s mind, to accept the belief that others have the right to dispose of his person at their whim, that the will of the majority is omnipoten t, that the physical force of muscles and numbers is a substitute for justice, reality and truth. We, the men of the mind, we who are traders, not masters or slaves, do not deal in blank checks or grant them. We do not live or work with any form of the non-objective. “So long as men, in the era of sa vagery, had no concept of objective reality and believed that physical na ture was ruled by the whim of unknowable demons—no thought, no sc ience, no production were possible. Only when men discovered that nature was a firm, predictable absolute were they able to rely on their knowledge, to choose their course, to plan their future and, slowly, to rise from the cave. Now you have placed modern industry, with its immense complexity of scientific precision, back into the power of unknowable demons—the unpre dictable power of the arbitrary whims of hidden, ugly little bureaucrats.

A man whose vision extends to a shanty, might cont inue to build on your quicksands, to grab a fast profit and run. A man w ho envisions skyscrapers, will not. Nor will he give ten years of unswerving de votion to the task of inventing a new product, when he knows that gangs of entrenched mediocrity are juggling the laws against him, to tie him, restri ct him and force him to fail, but should he fight them and struggle and succeed , they will seize his rewards and his invention. “Look past the range of the moment, you who cry that you fear to compete with men of superior intelligence, that their mind is a threat to your livelihood, that the strong leave no chance to the weak in a market of voluntary trade. What determines the material value of your work? Nothing but the productive effort of your mind— if you lived on a desert island. The less efficient the thinking of your br ain, the less your physical labor would bring you—and you could sp end your life on a single routine, collecting a precarious harvest or hunting with bow and arrows, unable to think any further. But when you live in a rational society, where men are free to trade, you receive an incalculable bonus: the material value of your work is determined not only by your effort, but by the effort of the best productive minds who exist in the world around you. “When you work in a modern factor y, you are paid, not only for your labor, but for all the produc tive genius which has made that factory possible: for the work of the industrialist who built it, for the work of the investor who saved the money to risk on the untried and the new, for the work of the engineer who designed the machines of which you are pushing the levers, for the work of the inventor who cr eated the product which you spend your time on making, for the work of the sc ientist who discovered the laws that went into the making of that product, for the work of the philosopher who taught men how to think and whom you spend your time denouncing. “The machine, the frozen form of a liv ing intelligence, is the power that expands the potential of your life by ra ising the productivity of your time.

Physical labor as such can extend no further than the range of the moment. The man who does no more than physi cal labor, consumes the material value-equivalent of his own contributio n to the process of production, and leaves no further value, neither for himself nor others. But the man who produces an idea in any field of ra tional endeavor—the man who discovers new knowledge—is the permanent bene factor of humanity. Material products can’t be shared, they belong to some ultimate consumer; it is only the value of an idea that can be shar ed with unlimited numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one’s sacrifice or loss, raising the productive capacity of whatever labor they perform. It is the value of his own time that the strong of the intellect transfers to the weak, letting them work on the jobs he discovered, while devoting his time to further discoveries. This is mutual trade to mutual advantage; the intere sts of the mind are one, no matter what the degree of intelligence, among men w ho desire to work and don’t seek or expect the unearned. “In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man who creates a new invention receives but a small percentage of his value in terms of material payment, no matter what fortune he makes, no matter what millions he earns. But the man who works as a ja nitor in the factory producing that invention, receives an enor mous payment in proporti on to the mental effort that his job requires of him . And the same is true of all men betw een, on all levels of ambition and ability. The man at the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes the most of all those be low him, but gets nothing except his material payment, receiving no intellect ual bonus from others to add to the value of his time. The man at the bottom who, left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing to those above him, but receives the bonus of all of their br ains. Such is the nature of the ‘competition’ between the strong and the weak of the intellect. Such is the pattern of ‘exploitation’ for wh ich you have damned the strong. “Such was the service we had given you and were glad and willing to give. What did we ask in return? No thing but freedom.

But the damned and the guiltiest among you are the men who had the capacity to know, yet chose to blank out reality, the men who were willing to sell their intelligence in to cynical servitude to force: the contemptible breed of those mystics of science who profess a devotion to some sort of ‘pure knowledge’—the pur ity consisting of their claim that such knowledge has no practical purpo se on this earth—who reserve their logic for inanimate matter, but believe that the subject of dealing with men requires and deserves no ra tionality, who scorn money and sell their souls in exchange for a laboratory supplied by loot. And since there is no such thing as ‘non-practical knowledge’ or any sort of ‘disinterested’ action, since they scorn the use of their science for the purpose and profit of life, they deliver their science to the service of death, to the only practical purpose it can ever have for looters: to inventing weapons of coercion and destruction.
