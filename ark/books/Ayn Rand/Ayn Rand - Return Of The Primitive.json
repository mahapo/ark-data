It was the time of the NewLeft—a time of organized violence, militant emotionalism, and open, pervasivenihilism. It was a time when college campuses were being forcibly shut down bystudent thugs brandishing “Free Speech” banners. It was a time when corporatebuildings and military-recruitment offices were being invaded by guerrillasdemanding “Peace Now!” It was a time of psychedelic “flower children” and“people’s armies,” of Timothy Leary and Abbie Hoffman and Charles Manson, of theTheater of the Absurd and the Black Panthers.Spearheading this mindlessness was a movement that resisted definition. Itsenemies were anyone and anything American, its heroes were dictatorial killerslike Ho Chi Minh and Fidel Castro, its goal was indiscriminate destruction—yetits leaders were hailed by cultural commentators as idealistic defenders of theindividual against an oppressive state.American society was under dizzying siege. It was in retreat, uncertain whetherto embrace or repel this onslaught—an onslaught launched in the name of a causeno one could name.Ayn Rand proceeded to name it.In her essays in this book, she identified its ideological essence. Sheexplained how the “revolutionaries” of that movement were faithful practitionersof every important idea their elders had taught them. She showed that the NewLeft was the offspring of the Establishment’s philosophers and of theiranti-reason, anti-individualism, anti-capitalism doctrines.Those doctrines were fused, in the 1960s, into an overwhelming hostility towardone distinctively Western target: industrialization. The New Left declared thatthe West was corrupt and that its influence had to be eliminated through therenunciation of technology. People were exhorted to give up their automobilesand shopping centers, their air conditioners and nuclear power plants.This was the distinguishing characteristic of the New Left. It brazenlyadvocated what prior collectivists had been reluctant to acknowledge—even tothemselves—as inherent in their philosophy. “The activists of the New Left,” AynRand wrote, “are closer [than those of the Old Left] to revealing the truth oftheir motives: they do not seek to take over industrial plants, they seek todestroy technology.”While the New Left did not triumph in its “anti-industrial revolution,” it didpave the way for an ongoing assault on the rational mind and its products.Writing about the New Left’s campus commandos, Ayn Rand said that “even thoughthe student rebellion has not aroused much public sympathy, the most ominousaspect of the situation is the fact that it has not met any ideologicalopposition,” that it has shown “the road ahead is empty, with no intellectualbarricades in sight” and that the “battle is to continue.”That battle is indeed continuing.It is being waged today by two cultural movements virulently opposed to theadvances—material and intellectual—created by Western civilization. One movementis environmentalism; the other, multiculturalism. Both seek to enshrine a newprimitivism.Primitive, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, means: “Of or belongingto the first age, period or stage; pertaining to early times ...” With respectto human development, primitivism is a pre-rational stage. It is a stage inwhich man lives in fearful awe of a universe he cannot understand. The primitiveman does not grasp the law of causality. He does not comprehend the fact thatthe world is governed by natural laws and that nature can be ruled by any manwho discovers those laws. To a primitive, there is only a mysterioussupernatural. Sunshine, darkness, rainfall, drought, the clap of thunder, thehooting of a spotted owl—all are inexplicable, portentous, and sacrosanct tohim. To this non-conceptual mentality, man is metaphysically subordinate tonature, which is never to be commanded, only meekly obeyed.This is the state of mind to which the environmentalists want us to revert.If primitive man regards the world as unknowable, how does he decide what tobelieve and how to act? Since such knowledge is not innate, where does primitiveman turn for guidance? To his tribe. It is membership in a collective thatinfuses such a person with his sole sense of identity. The tribe’s edicts thusbecome his unquestioned absolutes, and the tribe’s welfare becomes hisfundamental value.This is the state of mind to which the multiculturalists want us to revert. Theyhold that the basic unit of existence is the tribe, which they define by thecrudest, most primitive, most anti-conceptual criteria (such as skin color).They consequently reject the view that the achievements of Western—i.e.,individualistic—civilization represent a way of life superior to that of savagetribalism.Both environmentalism and multiculturalism wish to destroy the values of arational, industrial age. Both are scions of the New Left, zealously carrying onits campaign of sacrificing progress to primitivism. It is for the purpose of analyzing the philosophic progeny of the New Left thatthis expanded edition of The New Left has been compiled.I have retained everything from the original edition and added essays of my ownon environmentalism, multiculturalism, and feminism. Because multiculturalistshave fostered enormous confusion about the nature of racism and of “ethnicity,”I have also added two Ayn Rand articles on these subjects—“Racism” and “GlobalBalkanization”—even though they have previously been published elsewhere (thefirst in The Virtue of Selfishness, the second in The Voice of Reason).The result is a collection of essays identifying, explaining, and evaluatingdifferent manifestations of the same anti-industrial revolution.It is eye-opening to see how much of the New Left’s once-radical agenda not onlyhas been adopted by today’s society, but is no longer even controversial. Thetrappings of the New Left are gone, but its substance has endured.For example, in the 1960s there were repeated, charged confrontations betweencorporations and “back-to-nature” hippies over such matters as pollution andrecycling. Now, Earth Day is an annual cultural event—promoted by big business;now, countless products advertise themselves as “ecology friendly” (such asMc-Donald’s hamburgers, which the company boasts come from no cows that graze atthe expense of the planet’s “rain forests”); now, the major villains inchildren’s cartoon programs are not criminals, but greedy tree-loggers; and now,most states, according to a news report in the New York Times, “require schoolsto incorporate environmental concepts into virtually every subject in all gradelevels.”In the 1960s, college students forcibly occupied administration buildings,demanding courses in “black studies.” Today, every major university featuresfull departments (and even some designated dormitories and cafeterias) for avariety of ethnic excogitations. Today, instead of violent sit-ins, there hasbeen a quiet coup by “diversity committees,” whose authoritarian thought-policereign on campuses and who banish “politically incorrect” dissenters to thedungeons of re-education seminars.This devolution has been the result, not of the intellectual persuasiveness ofits defenders, but of the intellectual emptiness of its opponents. Theanti-industrial revolutionaries have been winning only by default. As Ayn Randsaid: “The uncontested absurdities of today are the accepted slogans oftomorrow. They come to be accepted by degrees, by dint of constant pressure onone side and constant retreat on the other—until one day when they are suddenlydeclared to be the country’s official ideology. That is the way welfare statismcame to be accepted in this country.”It is also the way multiculturalism and environmentalism have come to beaccepted. But this insidious process does not have to continue. The absurditiesthat have become today’s primitivism can, and urgently need to, be challenged.But they cannot be fought by the typically conservative method of arguing thatthey are good ideas that “unfortunately, go too far.” This battle requires anuncompromising loyalty to rational values—and a repudiation of the newprimitivism as fundamentally irrational.Perhaps this book will help people acquire the intellectual means and the moralconviction to mount such a battle. - Peter SchwartzJanuary 1998"},{"pageContent":"Foreword to the First EditionAbout a year ago, I received the following letter from a reader whom I have notmet:Dear Miss Rand:I am a graduate student in sociology at Northern Illinois University and astudent of Objectivism....Actually, what I want to discuss with you is your writings on the New Left. Ihave read them all and, in my opinion, they offer the best critical analysisthat has ever been written on this movement. Your recent articles: “The Left:Old and New”; “Apollo and Dionysus”; and your recent article in The New YorkTimes Sunday Magazine, “The New Left Represents an Intellectual Vacuum,” weresuperb. I recently reread your article, “The Cashing-In: The Student‘Rebellion,’ ” published in 1965, and I was struck by how accurate and propheticyour analysis was at that time.After reading these articles it occurred to me that, if they were all collectedtogether and published (i.e., mass-distributed in paperback by Signet), theycould have a tremendous impact on the culture and especially on the collegecampuses.It is my fervent hope that you will seriously consider issuing such a book, MissRand. Believe me, there are no other analyses of the New Left that measure up tothose published by The Objectivist. If the book was issued in paperback bySignet, ... as your other books have [been], it would be on almost everynewsstand and in every college bookstore. In fact, most college bookstoresdevote a section of their space to books dealing with the New Left and campusturmoil. Your book would therefore be displayed prominently. The publication anddistribution of such a book to college students could mark a turning point forthe students who read it. It would be a voice of reason for students to turn to.It would give them the intellectual ammunition that they could find nowhereelse....Sincerely,G.M.B.As a rule, I do not like practical suggestions from readers. But this was such agood idea so convincingly presented that I showed the letter to my publishers,who agreed with its writer wholeheartedly. Such was the origin of this book—withmy thanks to Mr. G. M. B.The purpose of the book is clearly stated in the letter: this book is intendedfor college students—for those among them who are seeking “a voice of reason toturn to.” It is intended also for all those who are concerned about collegestudents and about the state of modern education.I delayed the publication of the book in order to include two articles I wasplanning at the time, which belong in this collection (“The Anti-IndustrialRevolution” and “The Comprachicos”). I have included “The Cashing-In: TheStudent ‘Rebellion’ ” (originally published in The Objectivist Newsletter) inorder to let readers judge for themselves the accuracy of my understanding ofthe activist movement’s philosophical meaning, goals and sources.All the other articles in this book, with one exception, appeared originally inmy magazine The Objectivist. The date at the end of each article indicates thespecific issue. The exception is a brief piece which appeared as part of asymposium in The New York Times Magazine.—Ayn Rand New York City April 1971"},{"pageContent":"The Schools003 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_003_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"The Cashing-In: The Student “Rebellion”The so-called student “rebellion,” which was started and key-noted at theUniversity of California at Berkeley, has profound significance, but not of thekind that most commentators have ascribed to it. And the nature of themisrepresentations is part of its significance.The events at Berkeley began, in the fall of 1964, ostensibly as a studentprotest against the University administration’s order forbidding politicalactivity—specifically, the recruiting, fund-raising and organizing of studentsfor political action off-campus—on a certain strip of ground adjoining thecampus, which was owned by the University. Claiming that their rights had beenviolated, a small group of “rebels” rallied thousands of students of allpolitical views, including many “conservatives,” and assumed the title of the“Free Speech Movement.” The Movement staged “sit-in” protests in theadministration building, and committed other acts of physical force, such asassaults on the police and the seizure of a police car for use as a rostrum.The spirit, style and tactics of the rebellion are best illustrated by oneparticular incident. The University administration called a mass meeting, whichwas attended by eighteen thousand students and faculty members, to hear anaddress on the situation by the University President, Clark Kerr; it had beenexpressly announced that no student speakers would be allowed to address themeeting. Kerr attempted to end the rebellion by capitulating: he promised togrant most of the rebels’ demands; it looked as if he had won the audience tohis side. Whereupon, Mario Savio, the rebel leader, seized the microphone, in anattempt to take over the meeting, ignoring the rules and the fact that themeeting had been adjourned. When he was—properly—dragged off the platform, theleaders of the F.S.M. admitted, openly and jubilantly, that they had almost losttheir battle, but had saved it by provoking the administration to an act of“violence” (thus admitting that the victory of their publicly proclaimed goalswas not the goal of their battle).What followed was nationwide publicity, of a peculiar kind. It was a sudden and,seemingly, spontaneous out-pouring of articles, studies, surveys, revealing astrange unanimity of approach in several basic aspects: in ascribing to theF.S.M. the importance of a national movement, unwarranted by the facts—inblurring the facts by means of unintelligible generalities—in granting to therebels the status of spokesmen for American youth, acclaiming their “idealism”and “commitment” to political action, hailing them as a symptom of the“awakening” of college students from “political apathy.” If ever a “puff-job”was done by a major part of the press, this was it.In the meantime, what followed at Berkeley was a fierce, three-cornered struggleamong the University administration, its Board of Regents and its faculty, astruggle so sketchily reported in the press that its exact nature remainsfogbound. One can gather only that the Regents were, apparently, demanding a“tough” policy toward the rebels, that the majority of the faculty were on therebels’ side and that the administration was caught in the “moderate” middle ofthe road.The struggle led to the permanent resignation of the University’s Chancellor (asthe rebels had demanded)—the temporary resignation, and later reinstatement, ofPresident Kerr—and, ultimately, an almost complete capitulation to the F.S.M.,with the administration granting most of the rebels’ demands. (These includedthe right to advocate illegal acts and the right to an unrestricted freedom ofspeech on campus.)To the astonishment of the naive, this did not end the rebellion: the moredemands were granted, the more were made. As the administration intensified itsefforts to appease the F.S.M., the F.S.M. intensified its provocations. Theunrestricted freedom of speech took the form of a “Filthy Language Movement,”which consisted of students carrying placards with four-letter words, andbroadcasting obscenities over the University loudspeakers (which Movement wasdismissed with mild reproof by most of the press, as a mere “adolescent prank”).This, apparently, was too much even for those who sympathized with therebellion. The F.S.M. began to lose its following—and was, eventually,dissolved. Mario Savio quit the University, declaring that he “could not keep upwith the undemocratic procedures that the administration is following” (italicsmine)—and departed, reportedly to organize a nationwide revolutionary studentmovement.This is a bare summary of the events as they were reported by the press. Butsome revealing information was provided by volunteers, outside the regular newschannels, such as in the letters-to-the-editor columns.An eloquent account was given in a letter to The New York Times (March 31, 1965)by Alexander Grendon, a biophysicist in the Donner Laboratory, University ofCalifornia:The F.S.M. has always applied coercion to insure victory. One-party “democracy,”as in the Communist countries or the lily-white portions of the South, correctsopponents of the party line by punishment. The punishment of the recalcitrantuniversity administration (and more than 20,000 students who avoidedparticipation in the conflict) was to “bring the university to a grinding halt”by physical force.To capitulate to such corruption of democracy is to teach students that thesemethods are right. President Kerr capitulated repeatedly....Kerr agreed the university would not control “advocacy of illegal acts,” anabstraction until illustrated by examples: In a university lecture hall, aself-proclaimed anarchist advises students how to cheat to escape militaryservice; a nationally known Communist uses the university facilities to condemnour Government in vicious terms for its action in Vietnam, while funds tosupport the Vietcong are illegally solicited; propaganda for the use ofmarijuana, with instructions where to buy it, is openly distributed on campus.Even the abstraction “obscenity” is better understood when one hears a speaker,using the university’s amplifying equipment, describe in vulgar words hisexperiences in group sexual intercourse and homosexuality and recommend thesepractices, while another suggests students should have the same sexual freedomon campus as dogs....Clark Kerr’s “negotiation”—a euphemism for surrender—on each deliberate defianceof orderly university processes contributes not to a liberal university but to alawless one.David S. Landes, professor of history, Harvard University, made an interestingobservation in a letter to The New York Times (December 29, 1964). Stating thatthe Berkeley revolt represents potentially one of the most serious assaults onacademic freedom in America, he wrote:“In conclusion, I should like to point out the deleterious implications of thisdispute for the University of California. I know personally of five or sixfaculty members who are leaving, not because of lack of sympathy with ‘freespeech’ or ‘political action,’ but because, as one put it, who wants to teach atthe University of Saigon?”The clearest account and most perceptive evaluation were offered in an articlein the Columbia University Forum (Spring 1965), entitled “What’s Left atBerkeley,” by William Petersen, professor of sociology at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley.He writes:The first fact one must know about the Free Speech Movement is that it haslittle or nothing to do with free speech.... If not free speech, what then isthe issue? In fact, preposterous as this may seem, the real issue is the seizureof power....That a tiny number, a few hundred out of a student body of more than 27,000, wasable to disrupt the campus is the consequence of more than vigor and skill inagitation. This miniscule group could not have succeeded in getting so manystudents into motion without three other, at times unwitting, sources ofsupport: off-campus assistance of various kinds, the University administrationand the faculty.Everyone who has seen the efficient, almost military organization of theagitators’ program has a reasonable basis for believing that skilled personneland money are being dispatched into the Berkeley battle.... Around the Berkeleycommunity a dozen “ad hoc committees to support” this or that element of thestudent revolt sprang up spontaneously, as though out of nowhere.The course followed by the University administration... could hardly have betterfostered a rebellious student body if it had been devised to do so. To establishdubious regulations and when they are attacked to defend them by unreasonableargument is bad enough; worse still, the University did not impose on thestudents any sanctions that did not finally evaporate.... Obedience to norms isdeveloped when it is suitably rewarded, and when noncompliance is suitablypunished. That professional educators should need to be reminded of this axiomindicates how deep the roots of the Berkeley crisis lie.But the most important reason that the extremists won so many supporters amongthe students was the attitude of the faculty. Perhaps their most notoriouscapitulation to the F.S.M. was a resolution passed by the Academic Senate onDecember 8, by which the faculty notified the campus not only that theysupported all of the radicals’ demands but also that, in effect, they werewilling to fight for them against the Board of Regents, should that becomenecessary. When that resolution passed by an overwhelming majority—824 to 115votes—it effectively silenced the anti-F.S.M. student organizations....The Free Speech Movement is reminiscent of the Communist fronts of the 1930’s,but there are several important differences. The key feature, that a radicalcore uses legitimate issues ambiguously in order to manipulate a large mass, isidentical. The core in this case, however, is not the disciplined Communistparty, but a heterogeneous group of radical sects.Professor Petersen lists the various socialist, Trotskyist, communist and othergroups involved. His conclusion is: “The radical leaders on the Berkeley campus,like those in Latin American or Asian universities, are not the less radical forbeing, in many cases, outside the discipline of a formal political party. Theyare defined not by whether they pay dues to a party, but by their actions, theirvocabulary, their way of thinking. The best term to describe them, in myopinion, is Castroite.” This term, he explains, applies primarily to theirchoice of tactics, to the fact that “in critical respects all of them imitatethe Castro movement....“At Berkeley, provocative tactics applied not against a dictatorship but againstthe liberal, divided, and vacillating University administration proved to beenormously effective. Each provocation and subsequent victory led to the next.”Professor Petersen ends his article on a note of warning: “By my diagnosis ...not only has the patient [the University] not recovered but he is sicker thanever. The fever has gone down temporarily, but the infection is spreading andbecoming more virulent.”Now let us consider the ideology of the rebels, from such indications as weregiven in the press reports. The general tone of the reports was best expressedby a headline in The New York Times (March 15,1965): “The New Student Left:Movement Represents Serious Activists in Drive for Changes.”What kind of changes? No specific answer was given in the almost full-pagestory. Just “changes.”Some of these activists “who liken their movement to a ‘revolution,’ want to becalled radicals. Most of them, however, prefer to be called ‘organizers.’ ”Organizers—of what? Of “deprived people.” For what? No answer. Just“organizers.”“Most express contempt for any specific labels, and they don’t mind being calledcynics.... The great majority of those questioned said they were as skeptical ofCommunism as they were of any other form of political control.... ‘You might saywe’re a-Communist,’ said one of them, ‘just as you might say we’re amoral anda-almost everything else.’ ”There are exceptions, however. A girl from the University of California, one ofthe leaders of the Berkeley revolt, is quoted as saying: “At present thesocialist world, even with all its problems, is moving closer than any othercountries toward the sort of society I think should exist. In the Soviet Union,it has almost been achieved.”Another student, from the City College of New York, is quoted as concurring: “‘The Soviet Union and the whole Socialist bloc are on the right track,’ hesaid.”In view of the fact that most of the young activists were active in the civilrights movement, and that the Berkeley rebels had started by hiding behind theissue of civil rights (attempting, unsuccessfully, to smear all opposition as of“racist” origin), it is interesting to read that: “There is little talk amongthe activists about racial integration. Some of them consider the subject passé.They declare that integration will be almost as evil as segregation if itresults in a complacent, middle-class interracial society.”The central theme and basic ideology of all the activists is: anti-ideology.They are militantly opposed to all “labels,” definitions and theories; theyproclaim the supremacy of the immediate moment and commitment to action—tosubjectively, emotionally motivated action. Their anti-intellectual attituderuns like a stressed leitmotif through all the press reports.“The Berkeley mutineers did not seem political in the sense of those studentrebels in the Turbulent Thirties,” declares an article in The New York TimesMagazine (Feb. 14, 1965), “they are too suspicious of all adult institutions toembrace wholeheartedly even those ideologies with a stake in smashing thesystem. An anarchist or I.W.W. strain seems as pronounced as any Marxistdoctrine. ‘Theirs is a sort of political existentialism,’ says Paul Jacobs, aresearch associate at the university’s Center for the Study of Law and Society,who is one of the F.S.M.’s applauders. ‘All the old labels are out....’ ”And: “The proudly immoderate zealots of the F.S.M. pursue an activist creed—thatonly commitment can strip life of its emptiness, its absence of meaning in agreat ‘knowledge factory’ like Berkeley.”An article in The Saturday Evening Post (May 8, 1965), discussing the variousyouth groups of the left, quotes a leader of Students for a Democratic Society:“We began by rejecting the old sectarian left and its ancient quarrels, and witha contempt for American society, which we saw as depraved. We are interested indirect action and specific issues. We do not spend endless hours debating thenature of Soviet Russia or whether Yugoslavia is a degenerate workers’ state.”And: “With sit-ins we saw for the first time the chance for direct participationin meaningful social revolution.”“In their off-picket-line hours,” states the same article, “the P.L.[Progressive Labor] youngsters hang out at the experimental theaters and coffeeshops of Manhattan’s East Village. Their taste in reading runs more to Sartrethan to Marx.”With an interesting touch of unanimity, a survey in Newsweek (March 22, 1965)quotes a young man on the other side of the continent: “ ‘These students don’tread Marx,’ said one Berkeley Free Student Movement leader, ‘they read Camus.’ ”“If they are rebels,” the survey continues, “they are rebels without anideology, and without long-range revolutionary programs. They rally over issues,not philosophies, and seem unable to formulate or sustain a systematizedpolitical theory of society, either from the left or right.”“Today’s student seeks to find himself through what he does, not what hethinks,” the survey declares explicitly—and quotes some adult authorities insympathetic confirmation. “ ‘What you have now, as in the 30’s,’ says New YorkPost editor James A. Wechsler, ‘are groups of activists who really want tofunction in life.’ But not ideologically. ‘We used to sit around and debateMarxism, but students now are working for civil-rights and peace.’ ” RichardUnsworth, chaplain at Dartmouth, is quoted as saying: “In the world of today’scampus ‘the avenue now is doing and then reflecting on your doing, instead ofreflecting, then deciding, and then doing, the way it was a few years ago.’ ”Paul Goodman, described as writer, educator and “one of the students’ currentheroes,” is quoted as hailing the Berkeley movement because: “The leaders of theinsurrection, he says, ‘didn’t play it cool, they took risks, they were willingto be confused, they didn’t know whether it all would be a success or a failure.Now they don’t want to be cool any more, they want to take over.’ ” (Italicsmine. The same tribute could be paid to any drunken driver.)The theme of “taking over” is repeated again and again. The immediate target,apparently, is the takeover of the universities. The New York Times Magazinearticle quotes one of the F.S.M. leaders: “Our idea is that the university iscomposed of faculty, students, books and ideas. In a literal sense, theadministration is merely there to make sure the sidewalks are kept clean. Itshould be the servant of the faculty and the students.”The climax of this particular line was a news-story in The New York Times (March29, 1965) under the heading: “Collegians adopt a ‘Bill of Rights.’ ”“A group of Eastern college students declared here [in Philadelphia] thisweekend that college administrators should be no more than housekeepers in theeducational community.“The modern college or university, they said, should be run by the students andthe professors; administrators would be ‘maintenance, clerical and safetypersonnel whose purpose is to enforce the will of faculty and students.’ ”A manifesto to this effect was adopted at a meeting held at the University ofPennsylvania and attended by 200 youths “from 39 colleges in the Philadelphiaand New York areas, Harvard, Yale, the University of California at Berkeley, andfrom schools in the Midwest.”“A recurring theme in the meeting was that colleges and universities had becomeservants of the ‘financial, industrial, and military establishment,’ and thatstudents and faculty were being ‘sold down the river’ by administrators.“Among the provisions of the manifesto were declarations of freedom to join,organize or hold meetings of any organization ... abolition of tuition fees;control of law enforcement by the students and faculty; an end to the ReserveOfficer Training Corps; abolition of loyalty oaths; student-faculty control overcurriculum....”The method used to adopt that manifesto is illuminating: “About 200 studentsattended the meeting, 45 remaining until the end when the ‘Student Bill ofRights’ was adopted.” So much for “democratic procedures” and for the activists’right to the title of spokesmen for American youth.What significance is ascribed to the student rebellion by all these reports andby the authorities they choose to quote? Moral courage is not a characteristicof today’s culture, but in no other contemporary issue has moral cowardice beenrevealed to such a naked, ugly extent. Not only do most of the commentators lackan independent evaluation of the events, not only do they take their cue fromthe rebels, but of all the rebels’ complaints, it is the most superficial,irrelevant and, therefore, the safest, that they choose to support and to acceptas the cause of the rebellion: the complaint that the universities have grown“too big.”As if they had mushroomed overnight, the “bigness” of the universities issuddenly decried by the consensus as a national problem and blamed for the“unrest” of the students, whose motives are hailed as youthful “idealism.” Intoday’s culture, it has always been safe to attack “bigness.” And since themeaningless issue of mere size has long served as a means of evading realissues, on all sides of all political fences, a new catch phrase has been addedto the list of “Big Business,” “Big Labor,” “Big Government,” etc.: “BigUniversity.”For a more sophisticated audience, the socialist magazine The New Leader (Dec.21, 1964) offers a Marxist-Freudian appraisal, ascribing the rebellion primarilyto “alienation” (quoting Savio: “Somehow people are being separated off fromsomething”) and to “generational revolt” (“Spontaneously the natural idiom ofthe student political protest was that of sexual protest against the forbiddinguniversity administrator who ruled in loco parentis”).But the prize for expressing the moral-intellectual essence of today’s cultureshould go to Governor Brown of California. Remember that the University ofCalifornia is a state institution, that its Regents are appointed by theGovernor and that he, therefore, was the ultimate target of the revolt,including all its manifestations, from physical violence to filthy language.“Have we made our society safe for students with ideas?” said Governor Brown ata campus dinner. (The New York Times, May 22, 1965.) “We have not. Students havechanged but the structure of the university and its attitudes towards itsstudents have not kept pace with that change.“Therefore, some students felt they had the right to go outside the law to forcethe change. But in so doing, they displayed the height of idealistic hypocrisy.[Italics mine.] On the one hand, they held up the Federal Constitution,demanding their rights of political advocacy. But at the same time, they threwaway the principle of due process in favor of direct action.“In doing so, they were as wrong as the university. This, then, is the greatchallenge that faces us, the challenge of change.”Consider the fact that Governor Brown is generally regarded as a powerful chiefexecutive and, by California Republicans, as a formidable opponent. Consider thefact that “according to the California Public Opinion Poll, 74 percent of thepeople disapprove of the student protest movement in Berkeley.” (The New Leader,April 12, 1965.) Then observe that Governor Brown did not dare denounce amovement led or manipulated by a group of 45 students—and that he felt obligedto qualify the term “hypocrisy” by the adjective “idealistic,” thus creating oneof the weirdest combinations in today’s vocabulary of evasion.Now observe that in all that mass of comments, appraisals and interpretations(including the ponderous survey in Newsweek which offered statistics on everyimaginable aspect of college life) not one word was said about the content ofmodern education, about the nature of the ideas that are being inculcated bytoday’s universities. Every possible question was raised and considered, except:What are the students taught to think? This, apparently, was what no one dareddiscuss.This is what we shall now proceed to discuss.If a dramatist had the power to convert philosophical ideas into real,flesh-and-blood people and attempted to create the walking embodiments of modernphilosophy—the result would be the Berkeley rebels.These “activists” are so fully, literally, loyally, devastatingly the productsof modern philosophy that someone should cry to all the universityadministrations and faculties: “Brothers, you asked for it!”Mankind could not expect to remain unscathed after decades of exposure to theradiation of intellectual fission-debris, such as: “Reason is impotent to knowthings as they are—reality is unknowable—certainty is impossible—knowledge ismere probability—truth is that which works—mind is a superstition—logic is asocial convention—ethics is a matter of subjective commitment to an arbitrarypostulate”—and the consequent mutations are those contorted young creatures whoscream, in chronic terror, that they know nothing and want to rule everything.If that dramatist were writing a movie, he could justifiably entitle it “MarioSavio, Son of Immanuel Kant.”With rare and academically neglected exceptions, the philosophical “mainstream”that seeps into every classroom, subject and brain in today’s universities, is:epistemological agnosticism, avowed irrationalism, ethical subjectivism. Our ageis witnessing the ultimate climax, the cashing-in on a long process ofdestruction, at the end of the road laid out by Kant.Ever since Kant divorced reason from reality, his intellectual descendants havebeen diligently widening the breach. In the name of reason, Pragmatismestablished a range-of-the-moment view as an enlightened perspective on life,context-dropping as a rule of epistemology, expediency as a principle ofmorality, and collective subjectivism as a substitute for metaphysics. LogicalPositivism carried it further and, in the name of reason, elevated theimmemorial psycho-epistemology of shyster lawyers to the status of a scientificepistemological system—by proclaiming that knowledge consists of linguisticmanipulations. Taking this seriously, Linguistic Analysis declared that the taskof philosophy is, not to identify universal principles, but to tell people whatthey mean when they speak, which they are otherwise unable to know (which last,by that time, was true—in philosophical circles). This was the final stroke ofphilosophy breaking its moorings and floating off, like a lighter-than-airballoon, losing any semblance of connection to reality, any relevance to theproblems of man’s existence.No matter how cautiously the proponents of such theories skirted any referenceto the relationship between theory and practice, no matter how coyly theystruggled to treat philosophy as a parlor or classroom game—the fact remainedthat young people went to college for the purpose of acquiring theoreticalknowledge to guide them in practical action. Philosophy teachers evadedquestions about the application of their ideas to reality, by such means asdeclaring that “reality is a meaningless term,” or by asserting that philosophyhas no purpose other than the amusement of manufacturing arbitrary “constructs,”or by urging students to temper every theory with “common sense” - the commonsense they had spent countless hours trying to invalidate.As a result, a student came out of a modern university with the followingsediment left in his brain by his four to eight years of study: existence is anuncharted, unknowable jungle, fear and uncertainty are man’s permanent state,skepticism is the mark of maturity, cynicism is the mark of realism and, aboveall, the hallmark of an intellectual is the denial of the intellect.When and if academic commentators gave any thought to the practical results oftheir theories, they were predominantly united in claiming that uncertainty andskepticism are socially valuable traits which would lead to tolerance ofdifferences, flexibility, social “adjustment” and willingness to compromise.Some went so far as to maintain explicitly that intellectual certainty is themark of a dictatorial mentality, and that chronic doubt—the absence of firmconvictions, the lack of absolutes—is the guarantee of a peaceful, “democratic”society.They miscalculated.It has been said that Kant’s dichotomy led to two lines of Kantian philosophers,both accepting his basic premises, but choosing opposite sides: those who chosereason, abandoning reality—and those who chose reality, abandoning reason. Thefirst delivered the world to the second.The collector of the Kantian rationalizers’ efforts—the receiver of the bankruptshambles of sophistry, casuistry, sterility and abysmal triviality to which theyhad reduced philosophy—was Existentialism.Existentialism, in essence, consists of pointing to modern philosophy anddeclaring: “Since this is reason, to hell with it!”In spite of the fact that the pragmatists-positivists-analysts had obliteratedreason, the existentialists accepted them as reason’s advocates, held them up tothe world as examples of rationality and proceeded to reject reason altogether,proclaiming its impotence, rebelling against its “failure,” calling for a returnto reality, to the problems of human existence, to values, to action—tosubjective values and mindless action. In the name of reality, they proclaimedthe moral supremacy of “instincts,” urges, feelings—and the cognitive powers ofstomachs, muscles, kidneys, hearts, blood. It was a rebellion of headlessbodies.The battle is not over. The philosophy departments of today’s universities arethe battleground of a struggle which, in fact, is only a family quarrel betweenthe analysts and the existentialists. Their progeny are the activists of thestudent rebellion.If these activists choose the policy of “doing and then reflecting on yourdoing”—hasn’t Pragmatism taught them that truth is to be judged by consequences?If they “seem unable to formulate or sustain a systematized political theory ofsociety,” yet shriek with moral righteousness that they propose to achieve theirsocial goals by physical force—hasn’t Logical Positivism taught them thatethical propositions have no cognitive meaning and are merely a report on one’sfeelings or the equivalent of emotional ejaculations? If they are savagely blindto everything but the immediate moment—hasn’t Logical Positivism taught themthat nothing else can be claimed with certainty to exist? And while theLinguistic Analysts are busy demonstrating that “The cat is on the mat” does notmean that “the mat” is an attribute of “the cat,” nor that “on-the-mat” is thegenus to which “the cat” belongs, nor yet that “the-cat” equals “on-the-mat”—isit any wonder that students storm the Berkeley campus with placards inscribed“Strike now, analyze later”? (This slogan is quoted by Professor Petersen in theColumbia University Forum.)On June 14, CBS televised a jumbled, incoherent, unintelligible—and for thesevery reasons, authentic and significant—documentary entitled “The BerkeleyStory.” There is method in every kind of madness—and for those acquainted withmodern philosophy, that documentary was like a display of sideshow mirrorsthrowing off twisted reflections and random echoes of the carnage perpetrated inthe academic torture-chambers of the mind.“Our generation has no ideology,” declared the first boy interviewed, in thetone of defiance and hatred once reserved for saying: “Down with WallStreet!”—clearly projecting that the enemy now is not the “Robber Barons,” butthe mind. The older generation, he explained scornfully, had “a neat littlepill” to solve everything, but the pill didn’t work and they merely “got theirhearts busted.” “We don’t believe in pills,” he said.“We’ve learned that there are no absolute rules,” said a young girl, hastily anddefensively, as if uttering an axiom—and proceeded to explain inarticulately,with the help of gestures pointing inward, that “we make rules for ourselves”and that what is right for her may not be right for others.A girl described her classes as “words, words, words, paper, paper, paper”—andquietly, in a tone of authentic despair, said that she stopped at times towonder: “What am I doing here? I’m not learning anything.”An intense young girl who talked volubly, never quite finishing a sentence normaking a point, was denouncing society in general, trying to say that sincepeople are social products, society has done a bad job. In the middle of asentence, she stopped and threw in, as a casual aside: “Whatever way I turn out,I still am a product,” then went on. She said it with the simple earnestness ofa conscientious child acknowledging a self-evident fact of nature. It was not anact: the poor little creature meant it.The helpless bewilderment on the face of Harry Reasoner, the commentator, whenhe tried to sum up what he had presented, was an eloquent indication of why thepress is unable properly to handle the student rebellion. “Now—immediacy—anysituation must be solved now,” he said incredulously, describing the rebels’attitude, neither praising nor blaming, in the faintly astonished, faintlyhelpless tone of a man unable to believe that he is seeing savages running looseon the campus of one of America’s great universities.Such are the products of modern philosophy. They are the type of students whoare too intelligent not to see the logical consequences of the theories theyhave been taught—but not intelligent nor independent enough to see through thetheories and reject them.So they scream their defiance against “The System,” not realizing that they areits most consistently docile pupils, that theirs is a rebellion against thestatus quo by its archetypes, against the intellectual “Establishment” by itsrobots who have swallowed every shopworn premise of the “liberals” of the1930’s, including the catchphrases of altruism, the dedication to “deprivedpeople,” to such a safely conventional cause as “the war on poverty.” Arebellion that brandishes banners inscribed with bromides is not a veryconvincing nor very inspiring sight.As in any movement, there is obviously a mixture of motives involved: there arethe little shysters of the intellect who have found a gold mine in modernphilosophy, who delight in arguing for argument’s sake and stumping opponents bymeans of ready-to-wear paradoxes—there are the little role-players who fancythemselves as heroes and enjoy defiance for the sake of defiance—there are thenihilists who, moved by a profound hatred, seek nothing but destruction for thesake of destruction—there are the hopeless dependents who seek to “belong” toany crowd that would have them—and there are the plain hooligans who are alwaysthere, on the fringes of any mob action that smells of trouble. Whatever thecombination of motives, neurosis is stamped in capital letters across the wholemovement, since there is no such thing as rejecting reason through an innocenterror of knowledge. But whether the theories of modern philosophy serve merelyas a screen, a defense-mechanism, a rationalization of neurosis or are, in part,its cause—the fact remains that modern philosophy has destroyed the best inthese students and fostered the worst.Young people do seek a comprehensive view of life, i.e., a philosophy, they doseek meaning, purpose, ideals—and most of them take what they get. It is intheir teens and early twenties that most people seek philosophical answers andset their premises, for good or evil, for the rest of their lives. Some neverreach that stage; some never give up the quest; but the majority are open to thevoice of philosophy for a few brief years. These last are the permanent, if notinnocent, victims of modern philosophy.They are not independent thinkers nor intellectual originators; they are unableto answer or withstand the flood of modern sophistries. So some of them give up,after one or two unintelligible courses, convinced that thinking is a waste oftime—and turn into lethargic cynics or stultified Babbitts by the time theyreach twenty-five. Others accept what they hear; they accept it blindly andliterally; these are today’s activists. And no matter what tangle of motives nowmoves them, every teacher of modern philosophy should cringe in their presence,if he is still open to the realization that it is by means of the best withinthem, by means of their twisted, precarious groping for ideas, that he hasturned them into grotesque little monstrosities.Now what happens to the better minds in modern universities, to the students ofabove average intelligence who are actually eager to learn? What they find andhave to endure is a long, slow process of psycho-epistemological torture.Directly or indirectly, the influence of philosophy sets the epistemologicalstandards and methods of teaching for all departments, in the physical sciencesas well as in the humanities. The consequence, today, is a chaos of subjectivewhims setting the criteria of logic, of communication, demonstration, evidence,proof, which differ from class to class, from teacher to teacher. I am notspeaking of a difference in viewpoint or content, but of the absence of basicepistemological principles and the consequent difference in the method offunctioning required of a student’s mind. It is as if each course were given ina different language, each requiring that one think exclusively in thatlanguage, none providing a dictionary. The result—to the extent that one wouldattempt to comply—is intellectual disintegration.Add to this: the opposition to “system-building,” i.e., to the integration ofknowledge, with the result that the material taught in one class contradicts thematerial taught in the others, each subject hanging in a vacuum and to beaccepted out of context, while any questions on how to integrate it arerejected, discredited and discouraged.Add to this: the arbitrary, senseless, haphazard conglomeration of mostcurricula, the absence of any hierarchical structure of knowledge, any order,continuity or rationale—the jumble of courses on out-of-context minutiae andout-of-focus surveys—the all-pervading unintelligibility—the arrogantlyself-confessed irrationality—and, consequently, the necessity to memorize,rather than learn, to recite, rather than understand, to hold in one’s mind acacophony of undefined jargon long enough to pass the next exam.Add to this: the professors who refuse to answer questions—the professors whoanswer by evasion and ridicule—the professors who turn their classes intobull-sessions on the premise that “we’re here to mull things over together” -theprofessors who do lecture, but, in the name of “anti-dogmatism,” take no stand,express no viewpoint and leave the students in a maze of contradictions with nolead to a solution- the professors who do take a stand and invite the students’comments, then penalize dissenters by means of lower grades (particularly inpolitical courses).Add to this: the moral cowardice of most university administrations, the policyof permanent moral neutrality, of compromising on anything, of evading anyconflict at any price—and the students’ knowledge that the worst classroominjustice will remain uncorrected, that no appeal is practicable and no justiceis to be found anywhere.Yes, of course, there are exceptions—there are competent educators, brilliantminds and rational men on the university staffs—but they are swallowed in therampaging “mainstream” of irrationality and, too often, defeated by the hopelesspessimism of bitter, long-repressed frustration.And further: most professors and administrators are much more competent andrational as individuals than they are in their collective performance. Most ofthem realize and, privately, complain about the evils of today’s educationalworld. But each of them feels individually impotent before the enormity of theproblem. So they blame it on some nameless, disembodied, almost mystical power,which they designate as “The System”—and too many of them take it to be apolitical system, specifically capitalism. They do not realize that there isonly one human discipline which enables men to deal with large-scale problems,which has the power to integrate and unify human activities—and that thatdiscipline is philosophy, which they have set. instead, to the task ofdisintegrating and destroying their work.What does all this do to the best minds among the students? Most of them enduretheir college years with the teeth-clenched determination of serving out a jailsentence. The psychological scars they acquire in the process are incalculable.But they struggle as best they can to preserve their capacity to think, sensingdimly that the essence of the torture is an assault on their mind. And what theyfeel toward their schools ranges from mistrust to resentment to contempt tohatred—intertwined with a sense of exhaustion and excruciating boredom.To various extents and various degrees of conscious awareness, these feelingsare shared by the entire pyramid of the student body, from intellectual top tobottom. This is the reason why the handful of Berkeley rebels was able toattract thousands of students who did not realize, at first, the nature of whatthey were joining and who withdrew when it became apparent. Those students weremoved by a desperate, incoherent frustration, by a need to protest, not knowingfully against what, by a blind desire to strike out at the university somehow.I asked a small group of intelligent students at one of New York’s bestuniversities—who were ideologically opposed to the rebels—whether they wouldfight for the university administration, if the rebellion came to their campus.All of them shook their heads, with faint, wise, bitter smiles.The philosophical impotence of the older generation is the reason why the adultauthorities—from the Berkeley administration to the social commentators to thepress to Governor Brown—were unable to take a firm stand and had no rationalanswer to the Berkeley rebellion. Granting the premises of modern philosophy,logic was on the side of the rebels. To answer them would require a totalphilosophical re-evaluation, down to basic premises—which none of those adultswould dare attempt.Hence the incredible spectacle of brute force, hoodlum tactics and militantlyexplicit irrationality being brought to a university campus—and being met by thevague, uncertain, apologetic concessions, the stale generalities, the evasiveplatitudes of the alleged defenders of academic law and order.In a civilized society, a student’s declaration that he rejects reason andproposes to act outside the bounds of rationality, would be taken as sufficientgrounds for immediate expulsion—let alone if he proceeded to engage in mobaction and physical violence on a university campus. But modern universitieshave long since lost the moral right to oppose the first—and are, therefore,impotent against the second.The student rebellion is an eloquent demonstration of the fact that when menabandon reason, they open the door to physical force as the only alternative andthe inevitable consequence.The rebellion is also one of the clearest refutations of the argument of thoseintellectuals who claimed that skepticism and chronic doubt would lead to socialharmony. “When men reduce their virtues to the approximate, then evil acquiresthe force of an absolute, when loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped bythe virtuous, it’s picked up by scoundrels—and you get the indecent spectacle ofa cringing, bargaining, traitorous good and a self-righteously uncompromisingevil.” (Atlas Shrugged)Who stands to profit by that rebellion? The answer lies in the nature and goalsof its leadership.If the rank-and-file of the college rebels are victims, at least in part, thiscannot be said of their leaders. Who are their leaders? Any and all of thestatist-collectivist groups that hover, like vultures, over the remnants ofcapitalism, hoping to pounce on the carcass—and to accelerate the end, wheneverpossible. Their minimal goal is just “to make trouble”—to undercut, to confuse,to demoralize, to destroy. Their ultimate goal is to take over.To such leadership, the college rebels are merely cannon-fodder, intended tostick their headless necks out, to fight on campuses, to go to jail, to losetheir careers and their future—and eventually, if the leadership succeeds, tofight in the streets and lose their “non-absolute” lives, paving the way for theabsolute dictatorship of whoever is the bloodiest among the thugs scrambling forpower. Young fools who refuse to look beyond the immediate “now,” have no way ofknowing whose long-range goals they are serving.The communists are involved, among others; but, like the others, they are merelythe manipulators, not the cause, of the student rebellion. This is an example ofthe fact that whenever they win, they win by default—like germs feeding on thesores of a disintegrating body. They did not create the conditions that aredestroying American universities—they did not create the hordes of embittered,aimless, neurotic teenagers—but they do know how to attack through the soreswhich their opponents insist on evading. They are professional ideologists andit is not difficult for them to move into an intellectual vacuum and to hang thecringing advocates of “anti-ideology” by their own contradictions.For its motley leftist leadership, the student rebellion is a trial balloon, akind of cultural temperature-taking. It is a test of how much they can get awaywith and what sort of opposition they will encounter.For the rest of us, it is a miniature preview—in the microcosm of the academicworld—of what is to happen to the country at large, if the present culturaltrend remains unchallenged.The country at large is a mirror of its universities. The practical result ofmodem philosophy is today’s mixed economy with its moral nihilism, itsrange-of-the-moment pragmatism, its anti-ideological ideology and its trulyshameful recourse to the notion of “Government by Consensus.” (See my article inthe May and June 1965 issues of The Objectivist Newsletter.)Rule by pressure groups is merely the prelude, the social conditioning for mobrule. Once a country has accepted the obliteration of moral principles, ofindividual rights, of objectivity, of justice, of reason, and has submitted tothe rule of legalized brute force—the elimination of the concept “legalized”does not take long to follow. Who is to resist it—and in the name of what?When numbers are substituted for morality, and no individual can claim a right,but any gang can assert any desire whatever, when compromise is the only policyexpected of those in power, and the preservation of the moment’s “stability,” ofpeace at any price, is their only goal—the winner, necessarily, is whoeverpresents the most unjust and irrational demands; the system serves as an openinvitation to do so. If there were no communists or other thugs in the world,such a system would create them.The more an official is committed to the policy of compromise, the less able heis to resist anything: to give in, is his “instinctive” response in anyemergency, his basic principle of conduct, which makes him an easy mark.In this connection, the extreme of naive superficiality was reached by thosecommentators who expressed astonishment that the student rebellion had chosenBerkeley as its first battleground and President Kerr as its first target inspite of his record as a “liberal” and as a renowned mediator and arbitrator.“Ironically, some of the least mature student spokesmen ... tried to depict Mr.Kerr as the illiberal administrator,” said an editorial in The New York Times(March 11, 1965). “This was, of course, absurd in view of Mr. Kerr’s long andcourageous battle to uphold academic freedom and students’ rights in the face ofthose right-wing pressures that abound in California.” Other commentatorspictured Mr. Kerr as an innocent victim caught between the conflicting pressuresof the “conservatives” on the Board of Regents and the “liberals” on thefaculty. But, in fact and in logic, the middle of the road can lead to no otherfinal destination—and it is clear that the rebels chose Clark Kerr as theirfirst target, not in spite of, but because of his record.Now project what would happen if the technique of the Berkeley rebellion wererepeated on a national scale. Contrary to the fanatical belief of its advocates,compromise does not satisfy, but dissatisfies everybody; it does not lead togeneral fulfillment, but to general frustration; those who try to be all thingsto all men, end up by not being anything to anyone. And more: the partialvictory of an unjust claim, encourages the claimant to try further; the partialdefeat of a just claim, discourages and paralyzes the victim. If a determined,disciplined gang of statists were to make an assault on the crumbling remnantsof a mixed economy, boldly and explicitly proclaiming the collectivist tenetswhich the country had accepted by tacit default—what resistance would theyencounter? The dispirited, demoralized, embittered majority would remainlethargically indifferent to any public event. And many would support the gang,at first, moved by a desperate, incoherent frustration, by a need to protest,not knowing fully against what, by a blind desire to strike out somehow at thesuffocating hopelessness of the status quo.Who would feel morally inspired to fight for Johnson’s “consensus”? Who foughtfor the aimless platitudes of the Kerensky government in Russia—of the WeimarRepublic in Germany of the Nationalist government in China?But no matter how badly demoralized and philosophically disarmed a country mightbe, it has to reach a certain psychological turning point before it can bepushed from a state of semi-freedom into surrender to full-fledged dictatorship.And this was the main ideological purpose of the student rebellion’s leaders,whoever they were: to condition the country to accept force as the means ofsettling political controversies.Observe the ideological precedents which the Berkeley rebels were striving toestablish: all of them involved the abrogation of rights and the advocacy offorce. These notions have been publicized, yet their meaning has been largelyignored and left unanswered.1. The main issue was the attempt to make the country accept mass civildisobedience as a proper and valid tool of political action. This attempt hasbeen made repeatedly in connection with the civil rights movement. But there theissue was confused by the fact that the Negroes were the victims of legalizedinjustice and, therefore, the matter of breaching legality did not becomeunequivocally clear. The country took it as a fight for justice, not as anassault on the law.Civil disobedience may be justifiable, in some cases, when and if an individualdisobeys a law in order to bring an issue to court, as a test case. Such anaction involves respect for legality and a protest directed only at a particularlaw which the individual seeks an opportunity to prove to be unjust. The same istrue of a group of individuals when and if the risks involved are their own.But there is no justification, in a civilized society, for the kind of masscivil disobedience that involves the violation of the rights ofothers—regardless of whether the demonstrators’ goal is good or evil. The enddoes not justify the means. No one’s rights can be secured by the violation ofthe rights of others. Mass disobedience is an assault on the concept of rights:it is a mob’s defiance of legality as such.The forcible occupation of another man’s property or the obstruction of a publicthoroughfare is so blatant a violation of rights that an attempt to justify itbecomes an abrogation of morality. An individual has no right to do a “sit-in”in the home or office of a person he disagrees with—and he does not acquire sucha right by joining a gang. Rights are not a matter of numbers—and there can beno such thing, in law or in morality, as actions forbidden to an individual, butpermitted to a mob.The only power of a mob, as against an individual, is greater muscularstrength—i.e., plain, brute physical force. The attempt to solve social problemsby means of physical force is what a civilized society is established toprevent. The advocates of mass civil disobedience admit that their purpose isintimidation. A society that tolerates intimidation as a means of settlingdisputes—the physical intimidation of some men or groups by others—loses itsmoral right to exist as a social system, and its collapse does not take long tofollow.Politically, mass civil disobedience is appropriate only as a prelude to civilwar—as the declaration of a total break with a country’s political institutions.And the degree of today’s intellectual chaos and context-dropping was bestillustrated by some “conservative” California official who rushed to declarethat he objects to the Berkeley rebellion, but respects civil disobedience as avalid American tradition. “Don’t forget the Boston Tea Party,” he said,forgetting it.If the meaning of civil disobedience is somewhat obscured in the civil rightsmovement—and, therefore, the attitude of the country is inconclusive—thatmeaning becomes blatantly obvious when a sit-in is staged on a universitycampus. If the universities—the supposed citadels of reason, knowledge,scholarship, civilization—can be made to surrender to the rule of brute force,the rest of the country is cooked.2. To facilitate the acceptance of force, the Berkeley rebels attempted toestablish a special distinction between force and violence: force, they claimedexplicitly, is a proper form of social action, but violence is not. Theirdefinition of the terms was as follows: coercion by means of a literal physicalcontact is “violence” and is reprehensible; any other way of violating rights ismerely “force” and is a legitimate, peaceful method of dealing with opponents.For instance, if the rebels occupy the administration building, that is “force”;if policemen drag them out, that is “violence.” If Savio seizes a microphone hehas no right to use, that is “force”; if a policeman drags him away from it,that is “violence.”Consider the implications of that distinction as a rule of social conduct: ifyou come home one evening, find a stranger occupying your house and throw himout bodily, he has merely committed a peaceful act of “force,” but you areguilty of “violence” and you are to be punished.The theoretical purpose of that grotesque absurdity is to establish a moralinversion: to make the initiation of force moral, and resistance to forceimmoral—and thus to obliterate the right of self-defense. The immediatepractical purpose is to foster the activities of the lowest political breed: theprovocateurs, who commit acts of force and place the blame on their victims.3. To justify that fraudulent distinction, the Berkeley rebels attempted toobliterate a legitimate one: the distinction between ideas and actions. Theyclaimed that freedom of speech means freedom of action and that no clear line ofdemarcation can be drawn between them.For instance, if they have the right to advocate any political viewpoint—theyclaimed—they have the right to organize, on campus, any off-campus activities,even those forbidden by law. As Professor Petersen put it, they were claimingthe right “to use the University as a sanctuary from which to make illegal raidson the general community.”The difference between an exchange of ideas and an exchange of blows isself-evident. The line of demarcation between freedom of speech and freedom ofaction is established by the ban on the initiation of physical force. It is onlywhen that ban is abrogated that such a problem can arise—but when that ban isabrogated, no political freedom of any kind can remain in existence.At a superficial glance, the rebels’ “package-deal” may seem to imply a sort ofanarchistic extension of freedom; but, in fact and in logic, it implies theexact opposite—which is a grim joke on those unthinking youths who joined therebellion in the name of “free speech.” If the freedom to express ideas wereequated with the freedom to commit crimes, it would not take long to demonstratethat no organized society can exist on such terms and, therefore, that theexpression of ideas has to be curtailed and some ideas have to be forbidden,just as criminal acts are forbidden. Thus the gullible would be brought toconcede that the right of free speech is undefinable and “impracticable.”4. An indication of such a motive was given by the rebels’ demand forunrestricted freedom of speech on campus—with the consequent “Filthy LanguageMovement.”There can be no such thing as the right to an unrestricted freedom of speech (orof action) on someone else’s property. The fact that the university at Berkeleyis owned by the state, merely complicates the issue, but does not alter it. Theowners of a state university are the voters and taxpayers of that state. Theuniversity administration, appointed (directly or indirectly) by an electedofficial, is, theoretically, the agent of the owners—and has to act as such, solong as state universities exist. (Whether they should exist, is a differentquestion.)In any undertaking or establishment involving more than one man, it is the owneror owners who set the rules and terms of appropriate conduct; the rest of theparticipants are free to go elsewhere and seek different terms, if they do notagree. There can be no such thing as the right to act on whim, to be exercisedby some participants at the expense of others.Students who attend a university have the right to expect that they will not besubjected to hearing the kind of obscenities for which the owner of asemi-decent barroom would bounce hoodlums out onto the street. The right todetermine what sort of language is permissible, belongs to the administration ofa university—fully as much as to the owner of a barroom.The technique of the rebels, as of all statists, was to take advantage of theprinciples of a free society in order to undercut them by an allegeddemonstration of their “impracticability”—in this case, the “impracticability”of the right of free speech. But, in fact, what they have demonstrated is apoint farthest removed from their goals: that no rights of any kind can beexercised without property rights.It is only on the basis of property rights that the sphere and application ofindividual rights can be defined in any given social situation. Without propertyrights, there is no way to solve or to avoid a hopeless chaos of clashing views,interests, demands, desires and whims.There was no way for the Berkeley administration to answer the rebels except byinvoking property rights. It is obvious why neither modern “liberals” nor“conservatives” would care to do so. It is not the contradictions of a freesociety that the rebels were exposing and cashing-in on, but the contradictionsof a mixed economy.As to the question of what ideological policy should properly be adopted by theadministration of a state university, it is a question that has no answer. Thereare no solutions for the many contradictions inherent in the concept of “publicproperty,” particularly when the property is directly concerned with thedissemination of ideas. This is one of the reasons why the rebels would choose astate university as their first battleground.A good case could be made for the claim that a state university has no right toforbid the teaching or advocacy of any political viewpoint whatever, as, forinstance, of communism, since some of the taxpaying owners may be communists. Anequally good case could be made for the claim that a state university has noright to permit the teaching and advocacy of any political viewpoint which (as,for instance, communism) is a direct threat to the property, freedom and livesof the majority of the taxpaying owners. Majority rule is not applicable in therealm of ideas; an individual’s convictions are not subject to a majority vote;but neither an individual nor a minority nor a majority should be forced tosupport their own destroyers.On the one hand, a government institution has no right to forbid the expressionof any ideas. On the other hand, a government institution has no right toharbor, assist and finance the country’s enemies (as, for instance, thecollectors of funds for the Vietcong).The source of these contradictions does not lie in the principle of individualrights, but in their violation by the collectivist institution of “publicproperty.”This issue, however, has to be fought in the field of constitutional law, not oncampus. As students, the rebels have no greater rights in a state universitythan in a private one. As taxpayers, they have no greater rights than themillions of other California taxpayers involved. If they object to the policiesof the Board of Regents, they have no recourse except at the polls at the nextelection—if they can persuade a sufficient number of voters. This is a prettyslim chance—and this is a good argument against any type of “public property.”But it is not an issue to be solved by physical force.What is significant here is the fact that the rebels—who, to put it mildly, arenot champions of private property—refused to abide by the kind of majority rulewhich is inherent in public ownership. That is what they were opposing when theycomplained that universities have become servants of the “financial, industrialand military establishment.” It is the rights of these particular groups oftaxpayers (the right to a voice in the management of state universities) thatthey were seeking to abrogate.If anyone needs proof of the fact that the advocates of public ownership are notseeking “democratic” control of property by majority rule, but control bydictatorship—this is one eloquent piece of evidence.5. As part of the ideological conditioning for that ultimate goal, the rebelsattempted to introduce a new variant on an old theme that has been the object ofan intense drive by all statist-collectivists for many years past: theobliteration of the difference between private action and government action.This has always been attempted by means of a “package-deal” ascribing to privatecitizens the specific violations constitutionally forbidden to the government,and thus destroying individual rights while freeing the government from anyrestrictions. The most frequent example of this technique consists of accusingprivate citizens of practicing “censorship” (a concept applicable only to thegovernment) and thus negating their right to disagree. (See my article on “Man’sRights” in the April 1963 issue of The Objectivist Newsletter.)The new variant provided by the rebels was their protest against alleged “doublejeopardy.” It went as follows: if the students commit illegal acts, they will bepunished by the courts and must not, therefore, be penalized by the universityfor the same offense.“Double jeopardy” is a concept applicable only to one branch of the government,the judiciary, and only to a specific judiciary action: it means that a man mustnot be put on trial twice for the same offense.To equate private judgment and action (or, in this context, a governmentofficial’s judgment and action) with a court trial, is worse than absurd. It isan outrageous attempt to obliterate the right to moral judgment and moralaction. It is a demand that a lawbreaker suffer no civil consequences of hiscrime.If such a notion were accepted, individuals would have no right to evaluate theconduct of others nor to act according to their evaluation. They would have towait until a court had decreed whether a given man was guilty or innocent—andeven after he was pronounced guilty, they would have no right to change theirbehavior toward him and would have to leave the task of penalizing himexclusively to the government.For instance, if a bank employee were found guilty of embezzlement and hadserved his sentence, the bank would have no right to refuse to give him back hisformer job—since a refusal would constitute “double jeopardy.”Or: a government official would have no right to watch the legality of theactions of his department’s employees, nor to lay down rules for their strictobservance of the law, but would have to wait until a court had found themguilty of law-breaking—and would have to reinstate them in their jobs, afterthey had served their sentences for influence-peddling or bribe-taking ortreason.The notion of morality as a monopoly of the government (and of a single branchor group within the government) is so blatantly a part of the ideology of adictatorship that the rebels’ attempt to get away with it is truly shocking.6. The rebels’ notion that universities should be run by students and facultieswas an open, explicit assault on the right attacked implicitly by all theirother notions: the right of private property. And of all the variousstatist-collectivist systems, the one they chose as their goal is,politico-economically, the least practical; intellectually, the leastdefensible; morally, the most shameful: Guild Socialism.Guild socialism is a system that abolishes the exercise of individual ability bychaining men into groups according to their line of work, and delivering thework into the group’s power, as its exclusive domain, with the group dictatingthe rules, standards and practices of how the work is to be done and who shallor shall not do it.Guild socialism is the concrete-bound, routine-bound mentality of a savage,elevated into a social theory. Just as a tribe of savages seizes a piece ofjungle territory and claims it as a monopoly by reason of the fact of beingthere—so guild socialism grants a monopoly, not on a jungle forest or waterhole, but on a factory or a university—not by reason of a man’s ability,achievement or even “public service,” but by reason of the fact that he isthere.Just as savages have no concept of causes or consequences, of past or future,and no concept of efficacy beyond the muscular power of their tribe—so guildsocialists, finding themselves in the midst of an industrial civilization,regard its institutions as phenomena of nature and see no reason why the gangshould not seize them.If there is any one proof of a man’s incompetence, it is the stagnant mentalityof a worker (or of a professor) who, doing some small, routine job in a vastundertaking, does not care to look beyond the lever of a machine (or the lecternof a classroom), does not choose to know how the machine (or the classroom) gotthere or what makes his job possible, and proclaims that the management of theundertaking is parasitical and unnecessary. Managerial work—the organization andintegration of human effort into purposeful. large-scale, long-rangeactivities—is, in the realm of action, what man’s conceptual faculty is in therealm of cognition. It is beyond the grasp and, therefore, is the first targetof the self-arrested, sensory-perceptual mentality.If there is any one way to confess one’s own mediocrity, it is the willingnessto place one’s work in the absolute power of a group, particularly a group ofone’s professional colleagues. Of any forms of tyranny, this is the worst; it isdirected against a single human attribute: the mind—and against a single enemy:the innovator. The innovator, by definition, is the man who challenges theestablished practices of his profession. To grant a professional monopoly to anygroup, is to sacrifice human ability and abolish progress; to advocate such amonopoly, is to confess that one has nothing to sacrifice.Guild socialism is the rule of, by and for mediocrity. Its cause is a society’sintellectual collapse; its consequence is a quagmire of stagnation; itshistorical example is the guild system of the Middle Ages (or, in modern times,the fascist system of Italy under Mussolini).The rebels’ notion that students (along with faculties) should run universitiesand determine their curricula is a crude absurdity. If an ignorant youth comesto an institution of learning in order to acquire knowledge of a certainscience, by what means is he to determine what is relevant and how he should betaught? (In the process of learning, he can judge only whether his teacher’spresentation is clear or unclear, logical or contradictory; he cannot determinethe proper course and method of teaching, ahead of any knowledge of thesubject.) It is obvious that a student who demands the right to run a university(or to decide who should run it) has no knowledge of the concept of knowledge,that his demand is self-contradictory and disqualifies him automatically. Thesame is true—with a much heavier burden of moral guilt - of the professor whotaught him to make such demands and who supports them.Would you care to be treated in a hospital where the methods of therapy weredetermined by a vote of doctors and patients?Yet the absurdity of these examples is merely more obvious—not more irrationalnor more vicious—than the standard collectivist claim that workers should takeover the factories created by men whose achievement they can neither grasp norequal. The basic epistemological-moral premise and pattern are the same: theobliteration of reason obliterates the concept of reality, which obliterates theconcept of achievement, which obliterates the concept of the distinction betweenthe earned and the unearned. Then the incompetent can seize factories, theignorant can seize universities, the brutes can seize scientific researchlaboratories—and nothing is left in a human society but the power of whim andfist.What makes guild socialism cruder than (but not different from) moststatist-collectivist theories is the fact that it represents the other, theusually unmentioned, side of altruism: it is the voice, not of the givers, butof the receivers. While most altruistic theorists proclaim “the common good” astheir justification, advocate self-sacrificial service to the “community” andkeep silent about the exact nature or identity of the recipients ofsacrifices—guild socialists brazenly declare themselves to be the recipients andpresent their claims to the community, demanding its services. If they want amonopoly on a given profession, they claim, the rest of the community must giveup the right to practice it. If they want a university, they claim, thecommunity must provide it.And if “selfishness” is taken, by the altruists, to mean the sacrifice of othersto self, I challenge them to name an uglier example of it than the pronouncementof the little Berkeley collectivist who declared: “Our idea is that theuniversity is composed of faculty, students, books and ideas. In a literalsense, the administration is merely there to make sure the sidewalks are keptclean. It should be the servant of the faculty and the students.”What did that little disembodied mystic omit from his idea of a university? Whopays the salaries of the faculty? Who provides the livelihood of the students?Who publishes the books? Who builds the classrooms, the libraries, thedormitories—and the sidewalks? Leave it to a modern “mystic of muscle” todisplay the kind of contempt for “vulgar material concerns” that anold-fashioned mystic would not quite dare permit himself.Who—besides the university administration—is to be the voiceless, rightless“servant” and sidewalk-sweeper of the faculty and students? No, not only the menof productive genius who create the material wealth that makes universitiespossible, not only the “tycoons of big business,” not only the “financial,industrial, and military establishment”—but every taxpayer of the state ofCalifornia, every man who works for a living, high or low, every human being whoearns his sustenance, struggles with his budget, pays for what he gets, and doesnot permit himself to evade the reality of “vulgar material concerns.”Such is the soul revealed by the ideology of the Berkeley rebellion. Such is themeaning of the rebels’ demands and of the ideological precedents they weretrying to establish.Observe the complexity, the equivocations, the tricks, the twists, theintellectual acrobatics performed by these avowed advocates of unbridledfeelings—and the ideological consistency of these activists who claim to possessno ideology.The first round of the student rebellion has not gone over too well. In spite ofthe gratuitous “puff-job” done by the press, the attitude of the public is amixture of bewilderment, indifference and antagonism. Indifference—because theevasive vagueness of the press reports was self-defeating: people do notunderstand what it is all about and see no reason to care. Antagonism—becausethe American public still holds a profound respect for universities (as theymight be and ought to be, but are not any longer), and the commentators’half-laudatory, half-humorous platitudes about the “idealism of youth” have notsucceeded in whitewashing the fact that brute physical force was brought to auniversity campus. That fact has aroused a vague sense of uneasiness in people,a sense of undefined, apprehensive condemnation.The rebellion’s attempt to invade other campuses did not get very far. Therewere some disgraceful proclamations of appeasement by some universityadministrators and commencement orators this spring, but no discernible publicsympathy.There were a few instances of a proper attitude on the part of universityadministrations—an attitude of firmness, dignity and uncompromisingseverity—notably at Columbia University. A commencement address by Dr. Meng,president of Hunter College, is also worth noting. Declaring that the violationof the rights of others “is intolerable” in an academic community and that anystudent or teacher guilty of it deserves “instant expulsion,” he said:“Yesterday’s ivory tower has become today’s fox-hole. The leisure of the theoryclass is increasingly occupied in the organization of picket lines, teach-ins,think-ins, and stake-outs of one sort or another.” (The New York Times, June 18,1965.)But even though the student rebellion has not aroused much public sympathy, themost ominous aspect of the situation is the fact that it has not met anyideological opposition, that the implications of the rebels’ stand have neitherbeen answered nor rejected, that such criticism as it did evoke was, with rareexceptions, evasively superficial.As a trial balloon, the rebellion has accomplished its leaders’ purpose: it hasdemonstrated that they may have gone a bit too far, bared their teeth and clawsa bit too soon, and antagonized many potential sympathizers, even among the“liberals”—but that the road ahead is empty, with no intellectual barricades insight.The battle is to continue. The long-range intentions of the student rebellionhave been proclaimed repeatedly by the same activists who proclaim theirexclusive dedication to the immediate moment. The remnants of the “Free SpeechMovement” at Berkeley have been reorganized into a “Free Student Union,” whichis making militant noises in preparation for another assault. No matter howabsurd their notions, the rebels’ assaults are directed at the most importantphilosophical-political issues of our age. These issues cannot be ignored,evaded or bribed away by compromise. When brute force is on the march,compromise is the red carpet. When reason is attacked, common sense is notenough.Neither a man nor a nation can exist without some form of philosophy. A man hasthe free will to think or not; if he does not, he takes what he gets. The freewill of a nation is its intellectuals; the rest of the country takes what theyoffer; they set the terms, the values, the course, the goal.In the absence of intellectual opposition, the rebels’ notions will graduallycome to be absorbed into the culture. The uncontested absurdities of today arethe accepted slogans of tomorrow. They come to be accepted by degrees, byprecedent, by implication, by erosion, by default, by dint of constant pressureon one side and constant retreat on the other—until the day when they aresuddenly declared to be the country’s official ideology. That is the way welfarestatism came to be accepted in this country.What we are witnessing today is an acceleration of the attempts to cash in onthe ideological implications of welfare statism and to push beyond it. Thecollege rebels are merely the commandos, charged with the task of establishingideological beachheads for a full-scale advance of all the statist-collectivistforces against the remnants of capitalism in America; and part of their task isthe takeover of the ideological control of America’s universities.If the collectivists succeed, the terrible historical irony will lie in the factthat what looks like a noisy, reckless, belligerent confidence is, in fact, ahysterical bluff. The acceleration of collectivism’s advance is not the march ofwinners, but the blind stampede of losers. Collectivism has lost the battle formen’s minds; its advocates know it; their last chance consists of the fact thatno one else knows it. If they are to cash in on decades of philosophicalcorruption, on all the gnawing, scraping, scratching, burrowing to dig a maze ofphilosophical rat-holes which is about to cave in, it’s now or never.As a cultural-intellectual power and a moral ideal, collectivism died in WorldWar II. If we are still rolling in its direction, it is only by the inertia of avoid and the momentum of disintegration. A social movement that began with theponderous, brain-cracking, dialectical constructs of Hegel and Marx, and ends upwith a horde of morally unwashed children, each stamping his foot and shrieking:“I want it now!”—is through.All over the world, while mowing down one helpless nation after another,collectivism has been steadily losing the two elements that hold the key to thefuture: the brains of mankind and its youth. In regard to the first, observeBritain’s “brain drain.” In regard to the second, consider the fact (which wasnot mentioned in the press comments on the student rebellion) that in apredominant number of American universities, the political views of the facultyare perceptibly more “liberal” than those of the student body. (The same is trueof the youth of the country at large—as against the older generation, the 35 to50 age bracket, who were reared under the New Deal and who hold the country’sleadership, at present.) That is one of the facts which the student rebellionwas intended to disguise.This is not to say that the anti-collectivists represent a numerical majorityamong college students. The passive supporters of the status quo are always themajority in any group, culture, society or age. But it is not by passivemajorities that the trends of a nation are set. Who sets them? Anyone who caresto do so, if he has the intellectual ammunition to win on the battlefield ofideas, which belongs to those who do care. Those who don’t, are merely socialballast by their own choice and predilection.The fact that the “non-liberals” among college students (and among the youth ofthe world) can be identified at present only as “anti-collectivists” is thedangerous element and the question mark in today’s situation. They are the youngpeople who are not ready to give up, who want to fight against a swamp of evil,but do not know what is the good. They have rejected the sick, worn platitudesof collectivism—(along with all of its cultural manifestations, including thecult of despair and depravity—the studied mindlessness of jerk-and-moan dancing,singing or acting—the worship of anti-heroes—the experience of looking up to thedissection of a psychotic’s brain, for inspiration, and to the bare feet of aninarticulate brute, for guidance—the stupor of reduction to sensory stimuli—thesense of life of a movie such as Tom Jones)—but they have found, as yet, nodirection, no consistent philosophy, no rational values, no long-range goals.Until and unless they do, their incoherent striving for a better future willcollapse before the final thrust of the collectivists.Historically, we are now in a kind of intellectual no-man’s-land—and the futurewill be determined by those who venture out of the trenches of the status quo.Our direction will depend on whether the venturers are crusaders fighting for anew Renaissance or scavengers pouncing upon the wreckage left of yesterday’sbattles. The crusaders are not yet ready; the scavengers are.That is why—in a deeper sense than the little zombies of college campuses willever grasp—“Now, now, now!” is the last slogan and cry of the ragged, beardedstragglers who had once been an army rallied by the promise of a scientifically(!) planned society.The two most accurate characterizations of the student rebellion, given in thepress, were: “Political Existentialism” and “Castroite.” Both are conceptspertaining to intellectual bankruptcy: the first stands for the abdication ofreason—the second, for that state of hysterical panic which brandishes a fist asits sole recourse.In preparation for its published survey (March 22, 1965), Newsweek conducted anumber of polls among college students at large, on various subjects, one ofwhich was the question of who are the students’ heroes. The editors of Newsweekinformed me that my name appeared on the resultant list, and sent an interviewerto question me about my views on the state of modern universities. For reasonsbest known to themselves, they chose not to publish any part of that interview.What I said (in briefer form) was what I am now saying in this article—with theexception of the concluding remarks which follow and which I want to addressmost particularly to those college students who chose me as one of their heroes.Young people are constantly asking what they can do to fight today’s disastroustrends; they are seeking some form of action, and wrecking their hopes in blindalleys, particularly every four years, at election time. Those who do notrealize that the battle is ideological, had better give up, because they have nochance. Those who do realize it, should grasp that the student rebellion offersthem a chance to train themselves for the kind of battle they will have to fightin the world, when they leave the university; a chance, not only to trainthemselves, but to win the first rounds of that wider battle.If they seek an important cause, they have the opportunity to fight the rebels,to fight ideologically, on moral-intellectual grounds—by identifying andexposing the meaning of the rebels’ demands, by naming and answering the basicprinciples which the rebels dare not admit. The battle consists, above all, ofproviding the country (or all those within hearing) with ideological answers—afield of action from which the older generation has deserted under fire.Ideas cannot be fought except by means of better ideas. The battle consists, notof opposing, but of exposing; not of denouncing, but of disproving; not ofevading, but of boldly proclaiming a full, consistent and radical alternative.This does not mean that rational students should enter debates with the rebelsor attempt to convert them: one cannot argue with self-confessed irrationalists.The goal of an ideological battle is to enlighten the vast, helpless, bewilderedmajority in the universities—and in the country at large—or, rather, the mindsof those among the majority who are struggling to find answers or those who,having heard nothing but collectivist sophistries for years, have withdrawn inrevulsion and given up.The first goal of such a battle is to wrest from a handful of beatniks the titleof “spokesmen for American youth,” which the press is so anxious to grant them.The first step is to make oneself heard, on the campus and outside. There aremany civilized ways to do it: protest-meetings, public petitions, speeches,pamphlets, letters-to-editors. It is a much more important issue than picketingthe United Nations or parading in support of the House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee. And while such futile groups as Young Americans for Freedom areengaged in such undertakings, they are letting the collectivist vanguard speakin their name—in the name of American college students—without any audible soundof protest.But in order to be heard, one must have something to say. To have that, one mustknow one’s case. One must know it fully, logically, consistently, all the waydown to philosophical fundamentals. One cannot hope to fight nuclear expertswith Republican pea-shooters. And the leaders behind the student rebellion areexperts at their particular game.But they are dangerous only to those who stare at the issues out of focus andhope to fight ideas by means of faith, feelings and fund-raising. You would besurprised how quickly the ideologists of collectivism retreat when theyencounter a confident, intellectual adversary. Their case rests on appealing tohuman confusion, ignorance, dishonesty, cowardice, despair. Take the side theydare not touch: appeal to human intelligence.Collectivism has lost the two crucial weapons that raised it to world power andmade all of its victories possible: intellectuality and idealism, or reason andmorality. It had to lose precisely at the height of its success, since its claimto both was a fraud: the full, actual reality of socialist-communist-fasciststates has demonstrated the brute irrationality of collectivist systems and theinhumanity of altruism as a moral code.Yet reason and morality are the only weapons that determine the course ofhistory. The collectivists dropped them, because they had no right to carrythem. Pick them up; you have. (July- September 1965)"},{"pageContent":"The Chickens’ HomecomingA microcosmic version of what is wrong with today’s world, including the causeand the exact mechanics of how it got that way, was enacted at the annualbusiness meeting of the Eastern Division of the American PhilosophicalAssociation on December 28, 1969. Like an old-fashioned morality play, the eventhad an awe-inspiring element of justice: it would be hard to find a group of menwho had done more to deserve what they got.The central debate of the occasion was triggered by some philosophers, describedonly as “radical,” who demanded that the meeting pass a resolution they haddrafted. The resolution condemned the war in Vietnam, in blatantly Marxistterms, declaring that it is “a direct consequence of [America’s] foreign policywhose basic aim is to make and keep a large part of the world safe for Americanenterprise”; that American foreign aid, “particularly in underdevelopedcountries, amounts to the exploitation of the peoples of these countries” andthat it “necessitates the suppression of popular rebellions.”An allegedly conservative group opposed the resolution. According to The NewYork Times (December 29, 1969): “The academics, including some of the nation’sbest-known thinkers, filled the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel withhisses and shouts in debating the issue ...“While Vietnam was the ostensible subject of debate, the central issue was twoconflicting views of the task of philosophy—that the discipline’s job is totrain minds and advance thought dispassionately and aloof from politics, andthat philosophy should bring its talents to bear on the issues of the day. [Thisis a correct summary of the state of today’s philosophy; note the nature of thefalse dichotomy, which we shall discuss later.]“The debate was symptomatic of the uneasiness of many young students andprofessors in recent years who contend that philosophy has lost touch withAmerican life, being concerned instead with sterile quibbles over abstractions.[This is generosity on the part of the reporter: it is not over abstractionsthat today’s philosophers are quibbling.] It is a common saying that philosophynow devotes itself to the problems of philosophy, not the problems of men.”How did the “dispassionate mind-trainers” oppose the radicals? They did as well,and with the same results, as their former students do in comparable situations,such as the conservatives when opposing the liberals, or the liberals whenopposing the socialists, or the socialists when opposing the communists, orcollege administrators when opposing campus thugs: they steadfastly abstainedfrom mentioning any essentials or referring to any fundamental principles.First, they tried to resort to a typically modem weapon: evasion. “The opponents[of the resolution] made an early attempt to postpone discussion of the issueindefinitely,” writes The New York Times, “and lost by a vote of 120 to 78.”“I hope,” declared the leader of the radicals, “that we are not going toconstrue ourselves as a narrow professional organization. Our duty as peoplemust take priority over our alleged duty as ‘professionals.’ ”“This can only damage our association,” declared a leader of the opposition. “Iplead with you as philosophers to suspend judgment on some of the horrendousthings in this resolution.” (Ethics, apparently, is not part of philosophy and,in the face of a horrendous resolution, a philosopher must not attempt todiscover the truth or falsehood of its allegations: he must not pass judgment,but suspend it.)If such tactics are futile even in the realm of practical politics (with fiftyyears of evidence to demonstrate the failure), what could they be expected toachieve in the realm of philosophy? Just exactly what they did achieve. Theopponents of the radicals’ resolution did not win, they did not walk out, theydid not resign: they compromised.The meetine passed an amended resolution that kept the first and last paragraphsof the original virtually intact, but omitted all the rest. It omitted theMarxist evaluation of American foreign policy and condemned the war in Vietnamwithout reasons or explanations. In other words, it discarded Marxist theory,but accepted its product as if it were a self-evident primary requiring no proofor discussion.The quality and stature of the amendments may be gauged by the following:The first paragraph of the original resolution stated that the war in Vietnamconstitutes “a moral and political problem.” The amendment changed it to “amoral problem” (in the hope that no one would accuse the A.P.A. of taking apolitical stand—even though the resolution deals with the war in Vietnam).The last paragraph of the original resolution read: “Therefore, it is the senseof the American Philosophical Association that we oppose both the Vietnamizationof the war and the claim that the United States has any right to negotiate thefuture of the Vietnamese people, and we advocate instead the total withdrawalfrom Vietnam of all American forces as fast as the boats and planes can carrythem.”The last paragraph of the amended resolution reads: “It is the sense of theEastern Division of the American Philosophical Association that we oppose boththe policy of bombing villages to compensate for partial withdrawal of U.S.troops and the claim that the U.S. has any right to negotiate the future of theVietnamese people, and we advocate instead the total withdrawal from Vietnam ofall American forces as soon as physically possible.”Just as politicians feel it safe to take a firm stand in favor of motherhood, sotheir equivalents in philosophy felt it safe to take a stand against the bombingof villages. The implication, in their resolution, that such bombing is not amilitary necessity, but a deliberate, senseless atrocity on the part of the U.S.would be clear to a schoolboy, but, apparently, not to modem philosophers. Norwould it occur to them that viewing the war in Vietnam as a moral problem andcondemning the U.S., without a word about the nature, methods and atrocities ofthe enemy, is a moral obscenity—particularly in view of the fact that the U.S.has nothing to gain from that suicidal war and undertook it only in compliancewith these same philosophers’ morality of altruism.Apparently for fear of having succeeded at creating confusion and beingmisunderstood, the author of the amended resolution wrote a letter to the Editorof The New York Times (February 7, 1970) to correct its report: “The story andheadlines present the event as a victory of right-wing over left while, in fact,it was a victory for the moderate left. After all, the Putnam resolution waspassed, although with my moderating amendment.” So it was, which made mattersmuch worse for the American Philosophical Association—which is always the casewhen the moderates deal with moral issues, morality being a realm where nocompromise is possible.(An extra touch of grim justice: the author of the amended resolution had been agraduate philosophy student under one of the leaders of the conservativeopposition.)The original resolution was more honest than the amended one, and morephilosophical: it stated its theoretical base. That base (Marxism) is false ashell, but its very falsehood defeats it and works to protect the unwary: whenpeople know the theoretical grounds of any given stand, they are able to checkit, to judge and to decide whether they agree or not. To name one’s principlesis to open one’s declarations to serious critical appraisal. But the evasion oftheory, the enunciation of arbitrary inexplicable pronouncements, is an act ofdestruction that no Marxist theories could match: it destroys epistemology. Itundercuts the principles of rationality, invalidates the processes of acivilized discussion, discards logic and replaces it with the “Sez you—Sez I”method of communication—which the campus activists are using to great advantage.If you wonder how it came about that the American people were never given achance to vote on the question of whether they want to adopt socialism, yetvirtually the entire program of The Communist Manifesto has been enacted intolaw in this country—you have seen that process reenacted at a philosophicalconvention.To discard a theory, yet accept its product—to discard (or to hide) the Marxistmeans, but adopt and propagate its end—is contemptible, even for politicians.When philosophers do it, it amounts to a declaration that philosophy is dead andthat it died of unemployment.By way of an autopsy, examine the false dichotomy mentioned earlier, the “twoconflicting views of the task of philosophy.” One side holds that the task is“to train minds and advance thought” and that politics is not philosophy’sconcern; the other side holds that it is, and that philosophy must deal with“the issues of the day.” What subject is omitted from this dichotomy? Politics—in the full, exact, philosophical meaning of the term.Politics is the study of the principles governing the proper organization ofsociety; it is based on ethics, the study of the proper values to guide man’schoices and actions. Both ethics and politics, necessarily, have been branchesof philosophy from its birth.Philosophy is the science that studies the fundamental aspects of the nature ofexistence. The task of philosophy is to provide man with a comprehensive view oflife. This view serves as a base, a frame of reference, for all his actions,mental or physical, psychological or existential. This view tells him the natureof the universe with which he has to deal (metaphysics); the means by which heis to deal with it, i.e., the means of acquiring knowledge (epistemology); thestandards by which he is to choose his goals and values, in regard to his ownlife and character (ethics)—and in regard to society (politics); the means ofconcretizing this view is given to him by esthetics.It is not a question of whether man chooses to be guided by a comprehensiveview: he is not equipped to survive without it. The nature of his consciousnessdoes not permit him an animal’s percept-guided, range-of-the-moment form ofexistence. No matter how primitive his actions, he needs to project them intothe future and to weigh their consequences; this requires a conceptual process,and a conceptual process cannot take place in a vacuum: it requires a context.Man’s choice is not whether he needs a comprehensive view of life, but onlywhether his view is true or false. If it is false, it leads him to act as hisown destroyer.In the early stages of mankind’s development, that view was provided byreligion, i.e., by mystic fantasy. Man’s psycho-epistemological need is thereason why even the most primitively savage tribes always clung to some form ofreligious belief; the mystic (i.e., anti-reality) nature of their view was thecause of mankind’s incalculably long stagnation.Man came into his own in Greece, some two-and-a-half thousand years ago. Thebirth of philosophy marked his adulthood; not the content of any particularsystem of philosophy, but deeper: the concept of philosophy—the realization thata comprehensive view of existence is to be reached by man’s mind.Philosophy is the goal toward which religion was only a helplessly blindgroping. The grandeur, the reverence, the exalted purity, the austere dedicationto the pursuit of truth, which are commonly associated with religion, shouldproperly belong to the field of philosophy. Aristotle lived up to it and, inpart, so did Plato, Aquinas, Spinoza but how many others? It is earlier than wethink.If you observe that ever since Hume and Kant (mainly Kant, because Hume wasmerely the Bertrand Russell of his time) philosophy has been striving to provethat man’s mind is impotent, that there’s no such thing as reality and wewouldn’t be able to perceive it if there were—you will realize the magnitude ofthe treason involved.The task of philosophy requires the total best of a mind’s capacity; theresponsibility is commensurate. Most men are unable to form a comprehensive viewof life: some, because their ability is devoted to other professions; a greatmany, because they lack the ability. But all need that view and, consciously orsubconsciously, directly or indirectly, they accept what philosophy offers them.The integration of factual data, the maintenance of a full context, thediscovery of principles, the establishment of causal connections and thus theimplementation of a long-range vision—these are some of the tasks required of aphilosopher in every branch of his profession and, today, particularly inpolitics.In the space of a single lifetime, two world wars have devastated the entirecivilized world; two major dictatorships, in Russia and Germany, have committedsuch atrocities that most men are unable fully to believe it—and the bloody riseof rule by brute force is spreading around the globe. Something is obviouslywrong with mankind’s political ideas, and needs urgent attention. To declare—insuch circumstances—that politics is not the concern of philosophy is sounspeakable a default that it can be compared only to the stand of a doctordeclaring, in the midst of a bubonic plague epidemic, that health or disease isnot the concern of medicine.It is political philosophy that sets the goals and determines the course of acountry’s practical politics. But political philosophy means: abstract theory toidentify, explain and evaluate the trend of events, to discover their causes,project their consequences, define the problems and offer the solutions.Yet for many decades past, there has been no interest in political theory amongacademic philosophers; there has been no such thing as political philosophy—withthe stale exception of Marxism, if one can call it a philosophy.Bearing this in mind, evaluate the dichotomy displayed at the A.P.A. convention.If the conservative philosophers assert that their job is “to train minds andadvance thought, aloof from politics,” how do they propose to do it? To trainminds—in what skill? To advance thought—about what? Apparently, a man’s mind isto be trained to think with no reference to man’s problems and, therefore, withthe implicit knowledge that his thinking is of no consequence whatever to theevents taking place in the world around him or to his own life, goals andactions. If so, how long will he choose to think, and what will be his view ofthought and of reason? (You can see the answer on any campus in the country.)On the other hand, if the radical philosophers assert that their job is to dealwith “the issues of the day,” which day do they mean? Philosophical issues arenot of “the day” or even “the year.” Where do “the issues of the day” come from?Who originates them? How do philosophers determine which issue to pick up and onwhich side?It is obvious that what the radicals mean by political involvement is notprofessional, i.e., philosophical participation in politics, but an unthinking,emotional “commitment” to any slogan or issue of the immediate moment. Enjoying,by default, a monopoly on political philosophy, they are anxious to have itregarded as a subject closed to discussion, and they raise issues only in termsof practical politics, with the Marxist frame of reference to be taken forgranted, as dogma.The major part of the guilt, however, belongs to the conservatives: they haveaccepted the radicals’terms. When they speak of dispassionate aloofness frompolitics, they mean practical politics, but they discard the wider,philosophical meaning of the term as well. They concede the premise that thereis no such thing as political theory and that the realm of politics consists ofnothing but random concretes, below the level of philosophy’s concern. Which isall that the radicals want them to concede.The result, at that convention, was the spectacle of a gruesome battle: theadvocates of thought divorced from action versus the advocates of actiondivorced from thought—men armed with concepts in the form of floatingabstractions versus men armed with concrete-bound percepts.The outcome was a double disgrace: (1) that a philosophical association passed apolitical resolution and (2) the kind of resolution it passed.1. No professional organization has the right to take an ideological stand inthe name of its members. A man’s ideas, including political convictions, areexclusively his to determine and cannot be delegated to or prescribed by anyoneelse. It is not a matter of “professional ethics,” but of individual rights. Thepractice of passing ideological resolutions is a futile and immoral device ofpressure-group warfare. For all the very reasons that a philosopher, as athinking individual, should take a strong stand on political issues, he shouldnot allow it to be taken for him by a collective: he, above all other men,should know that a man’s convictions are not to be determined or prescribed bymajority vote. (The same moral principles apply to universities that attempt topass such resolutions.)2. If movie stars give out interviews criticizing military tactics, no one takesit seriously. If drugged adolescents scream demands that the war in Vietnam beended at once, regardless of means, methods, context or consequences, onewonders about the quality of their educators. But when an association ofphilosophers does both, it is a disgrace.The nature of our foreign policy is a proper concern of philosophy; the strategyof our military operations is not. The goal of the war in Vietnam is a properconcern of philosophy; the practice or nonpractice of bombing and the choice oftargets are not. (If someone squeaks that the bombing of villages is a “moral”issue, let him remember that villages are the enemy’s strongholds in Vietnam—afact which that shameful resolution neglected to mention.)There is a great deal that philosophers could do about the war in Vietnam, andtheir services are desperately needed. The whole country, including our soldiersdying in the jungles, is in a state of bewildered confusion about that war andits purpose. But a philosophical approach would consist of tracing theideological history of how we got into that war, what influences or interestspushed us in, what errors of our foreign policy were responsible, what basicpremises created that policy and how they should be corrected.If such a study were made, it would remind the country that the war in Vietnamwas started by President Kennedy, who is the idol of all the anti-warprotesters; that the basic premises of our foreign policy were set by anotheridol, President Roosevelt, and reinforced by the United Nations and by everypeace and One-World group ever since: the premises that we owe a duty to therest of the world, that we are responsible for the welfare of any nationanywhere on earth, that isolationism is selfish, immoral and impractical in a“shrinking” modern world, etc. Such a study would demonstrate the evil ofaltruistic “interventionism” or “internationalism,” and would define the properprinciples (the premises of national self-interest) that should guide America’sforeign policy.This is just a brief suggestion of what a philosopher’s task would be in regardto the war in Vietnam, but it is enough to indicate the scale of the allegedconservatives’ evasion.If——with reason, justice, morality, facts and history on their side—theyabdicated their leadership as philosophers and had nothing to offer people butthe advice to ignore politics, anyone could take over, and did.Passive resignation to disaster is not a widespread characteristic among men,particularly not among Americans. If, in a desperate situation, one sidedeclares that nothing can be done and the other offers the possibility ofaction, men will take the action—even if it is some suicidal attempt, such asthat resolution.It must be remembered that “reason,” “justice,” “morality,” “facts,” “history”are the things that most of those conservative philosophers had been proclaimingto be nonexistent or nonobjective or unknowable or unprovable or belonging tothe realm of arbitrary emotional choice. Through decades of promulgating suchdoctrines as Pragmatism, Logical Positivism, Linguistic Analysis, they refusedto consider the fact that these doctrines would disarm and paralyze the bestamong men, those who take philosophy seriously, and that they would unleash theworst, those who, scorning philosophy, reason, justice, morality, would have notrouble brushing the disarmed out of the way.This is the prospect they ignored in regard to the future of the country. It isjustice that the blow should strike them first. A tiny minority group took overthe leading branch of a profession of some 7,000 members and forced it to slapits own face by a resolution proclaiming that philosophy is a farce.The brothers had asked for it. To what sort of problems had they been givingpriority over the problems of politics? Among the papers to be read at that sameconvention were: “Pronouns and Proper Names”—“Can Grammar BeThought?”—“Propositions as the Only Realities.”The only reality, as it usually does, avenged itself at that convention. (June 1970)"},{"pageContent":"The ComprachicosIThe comprachicos, or comprapequeños, were a strange and hideous nomadicassociation, famous in the seventeenth century, forgotten in the eighteenth,unknown today....Comprachicos, as well as comprapequeños, is a compound Spanish word that means“child-buyers.”The comprachicos traded in children.They bought them and sold them.They did not steal them. The kidnapping of children is a different industry.And what did they make of these children?Monsters.Why monsters?To laugh.The people needs laughter; so do the kings. Cities require side-show freaks orclowns; palaces require jesters....To succeed in producing a freak, one must get hold of him early. A dwarf must bestarted when he is small....Hence, an art. There were educators. They took a man and turned him into amiscarriage; they took a face and made a muzzle. They stunted growth; theymangled features. This artificial production of teratological cases had its ownrules. It was a whole science. Imagine an inverted orthopedics. Where God hadput a straight glance, this art put a squint. Where God had put harmony, theyput deformity. Where God had put perfection, they brought back a botchedattempt. And, in the eyes of connoisseurs, it is the botched that wasperfect....The practice of degrading man leads one to the practice of deforming him.Deformity completes the task of political suppression....The comprachicos had a talent, to disfigure, that made them valuable inpolitics. To disfigure is better than to kill. There was the iron mask, but thatis an awkward means. One cannot populate Europe with iron masks; deformedmountebanks, however, run through the streets without appearing implausible;besides, an iron mask can be torn off, a mask of flesh cannot. To mask youforever by means of your own face, nothing can be more ingenious....The comprachicos did not merely remove a child’s face, they removed his memory.At least, they removed as much of it as they could. The child was not aware ofthe mutilation he had suffered. This horrible surgery left traces on his face,not in his mind. He could remember at most that one day he had been seized bysome men, then had fallen asleep, and later they had cured him. Cured him ofwhat? He did not know. Of the burning by sulphur and the incisions by iron, heremembered nothing. During the operation, the comprachicos made the littlepatient unconscious by means of a stupefying powder that passed for magic andsuppressed pain....In China, since time immemorial, they have achieved refinement in a special artand industry: the molding of a living man. One takes a child two or three yearsold, one puts him into a porcelain vase, more or less grotesque in shape,without cover or bottom, so that the head and feet protrude. In the daytime, onekeeps this vase standing upright; at night, one lays it down, so that the childcan sleep. Thus the child expands without growing, slowly filling the contoursof the vase with his compressed flesh and twisted bones. This bottleddevelopment continues for several years. At a certain point, it becomesirreparable. When one judges that this has occurred and that the monster ismade, one breaks the vase, the child comes out, and one has a man in the shapeof a pot. (Victor Hugo, The Man Who Laughs, translation mine.)Victor Hugo wrote this in the nineteenth century. His exalted mind could notconceive that so unspeakable a form of inhumanity would ever be possible again.The twentieth century proved him wrong.The production of monsters—helpless, twisted monsters whose normal developmenthas been stunted—goes on all around us. But the modern heirs of the comprachicosare smarter and subtler than their predecessors: they do not hide, they practicetheir trade in the open; they do not buy children, the children are delivered tothem; they do not use sulphur or iron, they achieve their goal without everlaying a finger on their little victims.The ancient comprachicos hid the operation, but displayed its results; theirheirs have reversed the process: the operation is open, the results areinvisible. In the past, this horrible surgery left traces on a child’s face, notin his mind. Today, it leaves traces in his mind, not on his face. In bothcases, the child is not aware of the mutilation he has suffered. But today’scomprachicos do not use narcotic powders: they take a child before he is fullyaware of reality and never let him develop that awareness. Where nature had puta normal brain, they put mental retardation. To make you unconscious for life bymeans of your own brain, nothing can be more ingenious.This is the ingenuity practiced by most of today’s educators. They are thecomprachicos of the mind.They do not place a child into a vase to adjust his body to its contours. Theyplace him into a “Progressive” nursery school to adjust him to society.The Progressive nursery schools start a child’s education at the age of three.Their view of a child’s needs is militantly anti-cognitive and anti-conceptual.A child of that age, they claim, is too young for cognitive training; hisnatural desire is not to learn, but to play. The development of his conceptualfaculty, they claim, is an unnatural burden that should not be imposed on him;he should be free to act on his spontaneous urges and feelings in order toexpress his subconscious desires, hostilities and fears. The primary goal of aProgressive nursery school is “social adjustment”; this is to be achieved bymeans of group activities, in which a child is expected to develop both“self-expression” (in the form of anything he might feel like doing) andconformity to the group.(For a presentation of the essentials of the Progressive nursery schools’theories and practice—as contrasted to the rationality of the Montessori nurseryschools—I refer you to “The Montessori Method” by Beatrice Hessen in TheObjectivist, May-July 1970.)“Give me a child for the first seven years,” says a famous maxim attributed tothe Jesuits, “and you may do what you like with him afterwards.” This is true ofmost children, with rare, heroically independent exceptions. The first five orsix years of a child’s life are crucial to his cognitive development. Theydetermine, not the content of his mind, but its method of functioning, itspsycho-epistemology. (Psycho-epistemology is the study of man’s cognitiveprocesses from the aspect of the interaction between man’s conscious mind andthe automatic functions of his subconscious.)At birth, a child’s mind is tabula rasa; he has the potential of awareness—themechanism of a human consciousness—but no content. Speaking metaphorically, hehas a camera with an extremely sensitive, unexposed film (his conscious mind),and an extremely complex computer waiting to be programmed (his subconscious).Both are blank. He knows nothing of the external world. He faces an immensechaos which he must learn to perceive by means of the complex mechanism which hemust learn to operate.If, in any two years of adult life, men could learn as much as an infant learnsin his first two years, they would have the capacity of genius. To focus hiseyes (which is not an innate, but an acquired skill), to perceive the thingsaround him by integrating his sensations into percepts (which is not an innate,but an acquired skill), to coordinate his muscles for the task of crawling, thenstanding upright, then walking—and, ultimately, to grasp the process ofconcept-formation and learn to speak—these are some of an infant’s tasks andachievements whose magnitude is not equaled by most men in the rest of theirlives.These achievements are not conscious and volitional in the adult sense of theterms: an infant is not aware, in advance, of the processes he has to perform inorder to acquire these skills, and the processes are largely automatic. But theyare acquired skills, nevertheless, and the enormous effort expended by an infantto acquire them can be easily observed. Observe also the intensity, the austere,the unsmiling seriousness with which an infant watches the world around him. (Ifyou ever find, in an adult, that degree of seriousness about reality, you willhave found a great man.)A child’s cognitive development is not completed by the time he is three yearsold—it is just about to begin in the full, human, conceptual sense of the term.He has merely traveled through the anteroom of cognition and acquired theprerequisites of knowledge, the rudimentary mental tools he needs to begin tolearn. His mind is in a state of eager, impatient flux: he is unable to catch upwith the impressions bombarding him from all sides; he wants to know everythingand at once. After the gigantic effort to acquire his mental tools, he has anoverwhelming need to use them.For him, the world has just begun. It is an intelligible world now; the chaos isin his mind, which he has not yet learned to organize—this is his next,conceptual task. His every experience is a discovery; every impression it leavesin his mind is new. But he is not able to think in such terms: to him, it is theworld that’s new. What Columbus felt when he landed in America, what theastronauts felt when they landed on the moon, is what a child feels when hediscovers the earth, between the ages of two and seven. (Do you think thatColumbus’ first desire was to “adjust” to the natives—or that the astronauts’first wish was to engage in fantasy play?)This is a child’s position at about the age of three. The next three or fouryears determine the brightness or the misery of his future: they program thecognitive functions of his subconscious computer.The subconscious is an integrating mechanism. Man’s conscious mind observes andestablishes connections among his experiences; the subconscious integrates theconnections and makes them become automatic. For example, the skill of walkingis acquired, after many faltering attempts, by the automatization of countlessconnections controlling muscular movements; once he learns to walk, a childneeds no conscious awareness of such problems as posture, balance, length ofstep, etc.—the mere decision to walk brings the integrated total into hiscontrol.A mind’s cognitive development involves a continual process of automatization.For example, you cannot perceive a table as an infant perceives it—as amysterious object with four legs. You perceive it as a table, i.e., a man-madepiece of furniture, serving a certain purpose belonging to a human habitation,etc.; you cannot separate these attributes from your sight of the table, youexperience it as a single, indivisible percept—yet all you see is a four-leggedobject; the rest is an automatized integration of a vast amount of conceptualknowledge which, at one time, you had to learn bit by bit. The same is true ofeverything you perceive or experience; as an adult, you cannot perceive orexperience in a vacuum, you do it in a certain automatized context—and theefficiency of your mental operations depends on the kind of context yoursubconscious has automatized.“Learning to speak is a process of automatizing the use (i.e., the meaning andthe application) of concepts. And more: all learning involves a process ofautomatizing, i.e., of first acquiring knowledge by fully conscious, focusedattention and observation, then of establishing mental connections which makethat knowledge automatic (instantly available as a context), thus freeing man’smind to pursue further, more complex knowledge.” (Introduction to ObjectivistEpistemology.)The process of forming, integrating and using concepts is not an automatic, buta volitional process—i.e., a process which uses both new and automatizedmaterial, but which is directed volitionally. It is not an innate, but anacquired skill; it has to be learned—it is the most crucially important part oflearning—and all of man’s other capacities depend on how well or how badly helearns it.This skill does not pertain to the particular content of a man’s knowledge atany given age, but to the method by which he acquires and organizesknowledge—the method by which his mind deals with its content. The methodprograms his subconscious computer, determining how efficiently, lamely ordisastrously his cognitive processes will function. The programming of a man’ssubconscious consists of the kind of cognitive habits he acquires; these habitsconstitute his psycho-epistemology.It is a child’s early experiences, observations and subverbal conclusions thatdetermine this programming. Thereafter, the interaction of content and methodestablishes a certain reciprocity: the method of acquiring knowledge affects itscontent, which affects the further development of the method, and so on.In the flux of a child’s countless impressions and momentary conclusions, thecrucial ones are those that pertain to the nature of the world around him, andto the efficacy of his mental efforts. The words that would name the essence ofthe long, wordless process taking place in a child’s mind are two questions:Where am I?—and: Is it worth it?The child’s answers are not set in words: they are set in the form of certainreactions which become habitual, i.e., automatized. He does not conclude thatthe universe is “benevolent” and that thinking is important—he develops an eagercuriosity about every new experience, and a desire to understand it.Subconsciously, in terms of automatized mental processes, he develops theimplicit equivalent of two fundamental premises, which are the cornerstones ofhis future sense of life, i.e., of his metaphysics and epistemology, long beforehe is able to grasp such concepts consciously.Does a child conclude that the world is intelligible, and proceed to expand hisunderstanding by the effort of conceptualizing on an ever-wider scale, withgrowing success and enjoyment? Or does he conclude that the world is abewildering chaos, where the fact he grasped today is reversed tomorrow, wherethe more he sees the more helpless he becomes—and, consequently, does he retreatinto the cellar of his own mind, locking its door? Does a child reach the stageof self-consciousness, i.e., does he grasp the distinction between consciousnessand existence, between his mind and the outside world, which leads him tounderstand that the task of the first is to perceive the second, which leads tothe development of his critical faculty and of control over his mentaloperations? Or does he remain in an indeterminate daze, never certain of whetherhe feels or perceives, of where one ends and the other begins, which leads himto feel trapped between two unintelligible states of flux: the chaos within andwithout? Does a child learn to identify, to categorize, to integrate hisexperiences and thus acquire the self-confidence needed to develop a long-rangevision? Or does he learn to see nothing but the immediate moment and thefeelings it produces, never venturing to look beyond it, never establishing anycontext but an emotional one, which leads him eventually to a stage where, underthe pressure of any strong emotion, his mind disintegrates and reality vanishes?These are the kinds of issues and answers that program a child’s mind in thefirst years of his life, as his subconscious automatizes one set ofcognitive—psycho-epistemological—habits or the other, or a continuum of degreesof precarious mixtures between the two extremes.The ultimate result is that by the age of about seven, a child acquires thecapacity to develop a vast conceptual context which will accompany andilluminate his every experience, creating an ever-growing chain of automatizedconnections, expanding the power of his intelligence with every year of hislife—or a child shrivels as his mind shrinks, leaving only a nameless anxiety inthe vacuum that should have been filled by his growing brain.Intelligence is the ability to deal with a broad range of abstractions. Whatevera child’s natural endowment, the use of intelligence is an acquired skill. Ithas to be acquired by a child’s own effort and automatized by his own mind, butadults can help or hinder him in this crucial process. They can place him in anenvironment that provides him with evidence of a stable, consistent,intelligible world which challenges and rewards his efforts to understand—or inan environment where nothing connects to anything, nothing holds long enough tograsp, nothing is answered, nothing is certain, where the incomprehensible andunpredictable lurks behind every corner and strikes him at any random step. Theadults can accelerate or hamper, retard and, perhaps, destroy the development ofhis conceptual faculty.Dr. Montessori’s Own Handbook indicates the nature and extent of the help that achild needs at the time he enters nursery school. He has learned to identifyobjects; he has not learned to abstract attributes, i.e., consciously toidentify things such as height, weight, color or number. He has barely acquiredthe ability to speak; he is not yet able to grasp the nature of this, to him,amazing skill, and he needs training in its proper use (i.e., training inconceptualization). It is psycho-epistemological training that Dr. Montessorihad in mind (though this is not her term), when she wrote the following abouther method:“The didactic material, in fact, does not offer to the child the ‘content’ ofthe mind, but the order for that ‘content.’ ... The mind has formed itself by aspecial exercise of attention, observing, comparing, and classifying.“The mental attitude acquired by such an exercise leads the child to makeordered observations in his environment, observations which prove as interestingto him as discoveries, and so stimulate him to multiply them indefinitely and toform in his mind a rich ‘content’ of clear ideas.“Language now comes to fix by means of exact words the ideas which the mind hasacquired.... In this way the children are able to ‘find themselves,’ alike inthe world of natural things and in the world of objects and of words whichsurround them, for they have an inner guide which leads them to become activeand intelligent explorers instead of wandering wayfarers in an unknown land.”(Maria Montessori, Dr. Montessori Own Handbook, New York, Schocken Books, 1965,pp. 137-138.)The purposeful, disciplined use of his intelligence is the highest achievementpossible to man: it is that which makes him human. The higher the skill, theearlier in life its learning should be started. The same holds true in reverse,for those who seek to stifle a human potential. To succeed in producing theatrophy of intelligence, a state of man-made stupidity, one must get hold of thevictim early; a mental dwarf must be started when he is small. This is the artand science practiced by the comprachicos of the mind.At the age of three, when his mind is almost as plastic as his bones, when hisneed and desire to know are more intense than they will ever be again, a childis delivered—by a Progressive nursery school—into the midst of a pack ofchildren as helplessly ignorant as himself. He is not merely left withoutcognitive guidance—he is actively discouraged and prevented from pursuingcognitive tasks. He wants to learn; he is told to play. Why? No answer is given.He is made to understand—by the emotional vibrations permeating the atmosphereof the place, by every crude or subtle means available to the adults whom hecannot understand—that the most important thing in this peculiar world is not toknow, but to get along with the pack. Why? No answer is given.He does not know what to do; he is told to do anything he feels like. He picksup a toy; it is snatched away from him by another child; he is told that he mustlearn to share. Why? No answer is given. He sits alone in a corner; he is toldthat he must join the others. Why? No answer is given. He approaches a group,reaches for their toys and is punched in the nose. He cries, in angrybewilderment; the teacher throws her arms around him and gushes that she loveshim.Animals, infants and small children are exceedingly sensitive to emotionalvibrations: it is their chief means of cognition. A small child senses whetheran adult’s emotions are genuine, and grasps instantly the vibrations ofhypocrisy. The teacher’s mechanical crib-side manner—the rigid smile, the cooingtone of voice, the clutching hands, the coldly unfocused, unseeing eyes—add upin a child’s mind to a word he will soon learn: phony. He knows it is adisguise; a disguise hides something; he experiences suspicion—and fear.A small child is mildly curious about, but not greatly interested in, otherchildren of his own age. In daily association, they merely bewilder him. He isnot seeking equals, but cognitive superiors, people who know Observe that youngchildren prefer the company of older children or of adults, that theyhero-worship and try to emulate an older brother or sister. A child needs toreach a certain development, a sense of his own identity, before he can enjoythe company of his “peers.” But he is thrown into their midst and told toadjust.Adjust to what? To anything. To cruelty, to injustice, to blindness, tosilliness, to pretentiousness, to snubs, to mockery, to treachery, to lies, toincomprehensible demands, to unwanted favors, to nagging affections, tounprovoked hostilities—and to the overwhelming, overpowering presence of Whim asthe ruler of everything. (Why these and nothing better? Because these are theprotective devices of helpless, frightened, unformed children who are leftwithout guidance and are ordered to act as a mob. The better kinds of actionsrequire thought.)A three-year-old delivered into the power of a pack of other three-year-olds isworse off than a fox delivered to a pack of hounds: the fox, at least, is freeto run; the three-year-old is expected to court the hounds and seek their lovewhile they tear him to pieces.After a while, he adjusts. He gets the nature of the game—wordlessly, byrepetition, imitation and emotional osmosis, long before he can form theconcepts to identify it.He learns not to question the supremacy of the pack. He discovers that suchquestions are taboo in some frightening, supernatural way; the answer is anincantation vibrating with the overtones of a damning indictment, suggestingthat he is guilty of some innate, incorrigible evil: “Don’t be selfish.” Thus heacquires self-doubt, before he is fully aware of a self.He learns that regardless of what he does—whether his action is right or wrong,honest or dishonest, sensible or senseless—if the pack disapproves, he is wrongand his desire is frustrated; if the pack approves, then anything goes. Thus theembryo of his concept of morality shrivels before it is born.He learns that it is no use starting any lengthy project of his own—such asbuilding a castle out of boxes—it will be taken over or destroyed by others. Helearns that anything he wants must be grabbed today, since there is no way oftelling what the pack will decide tomorrow. Thus his groping sense oftime-continuity—of the future’s reality—is stunted, shrinking his awareness andconcern to the range of the immediate moment. He is able (and motivated) toperceive the present; he is unable (and unmotivated) to retain the past or toproject the future.But even the present is undercut. Make-believe is a dangerous luxury, which onlythose who have grasped the distinction between the real and the imaginary canafford. Cut off from reality, which he has not learned fully to grasp, he isplunged into a world of fantasy playing. He may feel a dim uneasiness, at first:to him, it is not imagining, it is lying. But he loses that distinction and getsinto the swing. The wilder his fantasies, the warmer the teacher’s approval andconcern; his doubts are intangible, the approval is real. He begins to believehis own fantasies. How can he be sure of what is true or not, what is out thereand what is only in his mind? Thus he never acquires a firm distinction betweenexistence and consciousness: his precarious hold on reality is shaken, and hiscognitive processes subverted.His desire to know dies slowly; it is not killed—it is diluted and swims away.Why bother facing problems if they can be solved by make-believe? Why struggleto discover the world if you can make it become whatever you wish—by wishing?His trouble is that the wishing also seems to fade. He has nothing left to guidehim, except his feelings, but he is afraid to feel. The teacher prods him toself-expression, but he knows that this is a trap: he is being put on trialbefore the pack, to see whether he fits or not. He senses that he is constantlyexpected to feel, but he does not feel anything—only fear, confusion,helplessness and boredom. He senses that these must not be expressed, that thereis something wrong with him if he has such feelings—since none of the otherchildren seem to have them. (That they are all going through the same process,is way beyond his capacity to understand.) They seem to be at home—he is theonly freak and outcast.So he learns to hide his feelings, to simulate them, to pretend, to evade—torepress. The stronger his fear, the more aggressive his behavior; the moreuncertain his assertions, the louder his voice. From playacting, he progresseseasily to the skill of putting on an act. He does so with the dim intention ofprotecting himself, on the wordless conclusion that the pack will not hurt himif it never discovers what he feels. He has neither the means nor the courage tograsp that it is not his bad feelings, but the good ones, that he wants toprotect from the pack: his feelings about anything important to him, aboutanything he loves—i.e., the first, vague rudiments of his values.He succeeds so well at hiding his feelings and values from others that he hidesthem also from himself. His subconscious automatizes his act—he gives it nothingelse to automatize. (Years later, in a “crisis of identity,” he will discoverthat there is nothing behind the act, that his mask is protecting a vacuum.)Thus, his emotional capacity is stunted and, instead of “spontaneity” oremotional freedom, it is the arctic wastes of repression that he acquires.He cannot know by what imperceptible steps he, too, has become a phony.Now he is ready to discover that he need not gamble on the unpredictableapproval of the intangible, omnipotent power which he cannot name, but sensesall around him, which is named the will of the pack. He discovers that there areways to manipulate its omnipotence. He observes that some of the other childrenmanage to impose their wishes on the pack, but they never say so openly. Heobserves that the shifting will of the pack is not so mysterious as it seemed atfirst, that it is swung by a silent contest of wills among those who compete forthe role of pack leaders.How does one fight in such a competition? He cannot say—the answer would takeconceptual knowledge—but he learns by doing: by flattering, threatening,cajoling, intimidating, bribing, deceiving the members of the pack. Whichtactics does one use, when and on whom? He cannot say—it has to be done by“instinct” (i.e., by the unnamed, but automatized connections in his mind). Whatdoes he gain from this struggle? He cannot say. He has long since forgotten whyhe started it—whether he had some particular wish to achieve, or out of revengeor frustration or aimlessness. He feels dimly that there was nothing else to do.His own feelings now swing unpredictably, alternating between capricious fits ofdomination, and stretches of passive, compliant indifference which he can nameonly as: “What’s the use?” He sees no contradiction between his cynicalmaneuvering and his unalterable fear of the pack: the first is motivated by andreinforces the second. The will of the pack has been internalized: hisunaccountable emotions become his proof of its omnipotence.The issue, to him, is now metaphvsical. His subconscious is programmed, hisfundamentals are set. By means of the wordless integrations in his brain, thefaceless, intangible shape of the pack now stands between him and reality, withthe will of the pack as the dominant power. He is “adjusted.”Is this his conscious idea? It is not: he is wholly dominated by hissubconscious. Is it a reasoned conviction? It is not: he has not discoveredreason. A child needs periods of privacy in order to learn to think. He has hadless privacy in that nursery school than a convict in a crowded concentrationcamp. He has had no privacy even for his bathroom functions, let alone for suchan unsocial activity as concept-formation.He has acquired no incentive, no motive, to develop his intellect. Of whatimportance can reality be to him if his fate depends on the pack? Of whatimportance is thought, when the whole of his mental attention and energy aretrained to focus on detecting the emotional vibrations of the pack? Reality, tohim, is no longer an exciting challenge, but a dark, unknowable threat, whichevokes a feeling he did not have when he started: a feeling not of ignorance,but of failure, not of helplessness, but of impotence—a sense of his ownmalfunctioning mind. The pack is the only realm he knows where he feels at home;he needs its protection and reassurance; the art of human manipulation is theonly skill he has acquired.But humility and hostility are two sides of the same coin. An overwhelminghostility toward all men is his basic emotion, his automatic context for theconcept “man.” Every stranger he meets is a potential threat—a member of thatmystic entity, “others,” which rules him—an enemy to appease and to deceive.What became of his potential intelligence? Every precondition of its use hasbeen stunted; every prop supporting his mind has been cut: he has nosetf-confidence—no concept of self—no sense of morality—no sense oftime-continuity—no ability to project the future—no ability to grasp, tointegrate or to apply abstractions—no firm distinction between existence andconsciousness—no values, with the mechanism of repression paralyzing hisevaluative capacity.Any one of these mental habits would be sufficient to handicap his mind—letalone the weight of the total, the calculated product of a system devised tocripple his rational faculty.At the age of five-and-a-half, he is ready to be released into the world: animpotent creature, unable to think, unable to face or deal with reality, acreature who combines brashness and fear, who can recite its memorized lessons,but cannot understand them—a creature deprived of its means of survival, doomedto limp or stumble or crawl through life in search of some nameless relief froma chronic, nameless, incomprehensible pain.The vase can now be broken—the monster is made. The comprachicos of the mindhave performed the basic surgery and mangled the wiring——the connections—in hisbrain. But their job is not completed; it has merely begun.IIIs the damage done to a child’s mind by a Progressive nursery schoolirreparable?Scientific evidence indicates that it is in at least one respect: the timewasted in delaying a child’s cognitive development cannot be made up. The latestresearch on the subject shows that a child whose early cognitive training hasbeen neglected will never catch up, in intellectual progress, with a properlytrained child of approximately the same intelligence (as far as this last can beestimated). Thus all the graduates of a Progressive nursery school are robbed oftheir full potential, and their further development is impeded, slowed down,made much harder.But the Progressive nursery school does not merely neglect the cognitivetraining that a child needs in his early years: it stifles his normaldevelopment. It conditions his mind to an anti-conceptual method of functioningthat paralyzes his rational faculty.Can the damage be corrected or is the child doomed to a lifetime of conceptualimpotence?This is an open question. No firm answer can be given on the present level ofknowledge.We know that a child’s bones are not fully formed at birth: they are soft andplastic up to a certain age, and harden gradually into their final shape. Thereis a strong likelihood that the same is true of a child’s mind: it is blank andflexible at birth, but its early programming may become indelible at a certainpoint. The body has its own timetable of development, and so, perhaps, has themind. If some complex skills are not acquired by a certain age, it may becometoo late to acquire them. But the mind has a wider range of possibilities, agreater capacity to recover, because its volitional faculty gives it the powerto control its operations.Volition, however, does not mean non-identity; it does not mean that one canmisuse one’s mind indefinitely without suffering permanent damage. But it doesmean that so long as a child is not insane, he has the power to correct manyfaults in his mental functioning, and many injuries, whether they areself-inflicted or imposed on him from the outside. The latter are easier tocorrect than the former.The evidence indicates that some graduates of the Progressive nursery schools dorecover and others do not—and that their recovery depends on the degree of their“nonadjustment,” i.e., the degree to which they rejected the school’sconditioning. By “recovery” I mean the eventual development of a rationalpsycho-epistemology, i.e., of the ability to deal with reality by means ofconceptual knowledge.It is the little “misfits” who have the best chance to recover—the children whodo not conform, the children who endure three years of agonizing misery,loneliness, confusion, abuse by the teachers and by their “peers,” but remainaloof and withdrawn, unable to give in, unable to fake, armed with nothing butthe feeling that there is something wrong in that nursery school.These are the “problem children” who are periodically put through the torture ofthe teachers’ complaints to their parents, and through the helpless despair ofseeing their parents side with the torturers. Some of these children areviolently rebellious; others seem outwardly timid and passive, but are outsidethe reach of any pressure or influence. Whatever their particular forms ofbearing the unbearable, what they all have in common is the inability to fit in,i.e., to accept the intellectual authority of the pack. (Not all “misfits”belong to this category; there are children who reject the pack for entirelydifferent reasons, such as frustrated powerlust.)The nonconformists are heroic little martyrs who are given no credit byanyone—not even by themselves, since they cannot identify the nature of theirbattle. They do not have the conceptual knowledge or the introspective skill tograsp that they are unable and unwilling to accept anything withoutunderstanding it, and that they are holding to the sovereignty of their ownjudgment against the terrifying pressure of everyone around them.These children have no means of knowing that what they are fighting for is theintegrity of their minds—and that they will come out of those schools with manyproblems, battered, twisted, frightened, discouraged or embittered, but it istheir rational faculty that they will have saved.The little manipulators, the “adjusted” little pack leaders, will not.The manipulators have, in effect, sold out: they have accepted the approval ofthe pack and/or power over the pack as a value, in exchange for surrenderingtheir judgment. To fake reality at an age when one has not learned fully tograsp it—to automatize a technique of deception when one has not yet automatizedthe technique of perception—is an extremely dangerous thing to do to one’s ownmind. It is highly doubtful whether this kind of priority can ever be reversed.The little manipulators acquire a vested interest in evasion. The longer theypractice their policies, the greater their fear of reality and the slimmer theirchance of ever recapturing the desire to face it, to know, to understand.The principle involved is clear on an adult level: when men are caught in thepower of an enormous evil—such as under the Soviet or Nazi dictatorship—thosewho are willing to suffer as helpless victims, rather than make terms with theevil, have a good chance to regain their psychological health; but not those whojoin the G.P.U. or the S.S.Even though the major part of the guilt belongs to his teachers, the littlemanipulator is not entirely innocent. He is too young to understand theimmorality of his course, but nature gives him an emotional warning: he does notlike himself when he engages in deception, he feels dirty, unworthy, unclean.This protest of a violated consciousness serves the same purpose as physicalpain: it is the warning of a dangerous malfunction or injury. No one can force achild to disregard a warning of this kind; if he does, if he chooses to placesome value above his own sense of himself, what he gradually kills is hisself-esteem. Thereafter, he is left without motivation to correct hispsycho-epistemology; he has reason to dread reason, reality and truth; hisentire emotional mechanism is automatized to serve as a defense against them.The majority of the Progressive nursery schools’ graduates represent a mixtureof psychological elements, on a continuum between the nonconformist and themanipulator. Their future development depends in large part on the nature oftheir future education. The nursery schools have taught them the wrong method ofmental functioning; now they are expected to begin acquiring mental content,i.e., ideas, by such means as they possess.The modern educators—the comprachicos of the mind—are prepared for the secondstage of their task: to indoctrinate the children with the kinds of ideas thatwill make their intellectual recovery unlikely, if not impossible—and to do itby the kind of method that continues and reinforces the conditioning begun inthe nursery school. The program is devised to stunt the minds of those whomanaged to survive the first stage with some remnants of their rationalcapacity, and to cripple those who were fortunate enough not to be sent to aProgressive nursery. In comprachico terms, this program means: to keep tearingthe scabs off the wounds left by the original surgery and to keep infecting thewounds until the child’s mind and spirit are broken.To stunt a mind means to arrest its conceptual development, its power to useabstractions—and to keep it on a concrete-bound, perceptual method offunctioning.John Dewey, the father of modern education (including the Progressive nurseryschools), opposed the teaching of theoretical (i.e., conceptual) knowledge, anddemanded that it be replaced by concrete, “practical” action, in the form of“class projects” which would develop the students’ social spirit.“The mere absorbing of facts and truths,” he wrote, “is so exclusivelyindividual an affair that it tends very naturally to pass into selfishness.There is no obvious social motive for the acquirement of mere learning, there isno clear social gain in success thereat.” (John Dewey, The School and Society,Chicago, The University of Chicago Press, 1956, p. 15.)This much is true: the perception of reality, the learning of facts, the abilityto distinguish truth from falsehood, are exclusively individual capacities; themind is an exclusively individual “affair”; there is no such thing as acollective brain. And intellectual integrity——the refusal to sacrifice one’smind and one’s knowledge of the truth to any social pressures—is a profoundlyand properly selfish attitude.The goal of modern education is to stunt, stifle and destroy the students’capacity to develop such an attitude, as well as its conceptual andpsycho-epistemological preconditions.There are two different methods of learning: by memorizing and by understanding.The first belongs primarily to the perceptual level of a human consciousness,the second to the conceptual.The first is achieved by means of repetition and concrete-bound association (aprocess in which one sensory concrete leads automatically to another, with noregard to content or meaning). The best illustration of this process is a songwhich was popular some twenty years ago, called “Mairzy Doats.” Try to recallsome poem you had to memorize in grade school; you will find that you can recallit only if you recite the sounds automatically, by the “Mairzy Doats” method; ifyou focus on the meaning, the memory vanishes. This form of learning is sharedwith man by the higher animals: all animal training consists of making theanimal memorize a series of actions by repetition and association.The second method of learning—by a process of understanding—is possible only toman. To understand means to focus on the content of a given subject (as againstthe sensory—visual or auditory—form in which it is communicated), to isolate itsessentials, to establish its relationship to the previously known, and tointegrate it with the appropriate categories of other subjects. Integration isthe essential part of understanding.The predominance of memorizing is proper only in the first few years of achild’s education, while he is observing and gathering perceptual material. Fromthe time he reaches the conceptual level (i.e., from the time he learns tospeak), his education requires a progressively larger scale of understanding andprogressively smaller amounts of memorizing.Just as modern educators proclaim the importance of developing a child’sindividuality, yet train him to conform to the pack, so they denouncememorization, yet their method of teaching ignores the requirements ofconceptual development and confines learning predominantly to a process ofmemorizing. To grasp what this does to a child’s mind, project what it would doto a child’s body if, at the age of seven, he were not permitted to walk, butwere required to crawl and stumble like an infant.The comprachico technique starts at the base. The child’s great achievement inlearning to speak is undercut and all but nullified by the method used to teachhim to read. The “Look-Say” method substitutes the concrete-bound memorizationof the visual shapes of words for the phonetic method which taught a child totreat letters and sounds as abstractions. The senseless memorizing of such avast amount of sensory material places an abnormal strain on a child’s mentalcapacity, a burden that cannot be fully retained, integrated or automatized. Theresult is a widespread “reading neurosis”—the inability to learn to read—amongchildren, including many of above average intelligence, a neurosis that did notexist prior to the introduction of the “Look-Say” method. (If the enlightenmentand welfare of children were the modern educators’ goal, the incidence of thatneurosis would have made them check and revise their educational theories; ithas not.)The ultimate result is the half-illiterate college freshmen who are unable toread a book (in the sense of understanding its content, as against looking atits pages) or to write a paper or to spell—or even to speak coherently, which iscaused by the inability to organize their thoughts, if any.When applied to conceptual material, memorizing is the psycho-epistemologicaldestroyer of understanding and of the ability to think. But throughout theirgrade- and high-school years, memorizing becomes the students’ dominant (and, insome cases, virtually exclusive) method of mental functioning. They have noother way to cope with the schools’ curricula that consist predominantly ofrandom, haphazard, disintegrated (and unintegratable) snatches of varioussubjects, without context, continuity or systematic progression.The material taught in one class has no relation to and frequently contradictsthe material taught in another. The cure, introduced by the modem educators, isworse than the disease; it consists in the following procedure: a “theme” ispicked at random for a given period of time, during which every teacher presentshis subject in relation to that theme, without context or earlier preparation.For instance, if the theme is “shoes,” the teacher of physics discusses themachinery required to make shoes, the teacher of chemistry discusses the tanningof leather, the teacher of economics discusses the production and consumption ofshoes, the teacher of mathematics gives problems in calculating the costs ofshoes, the teacher of English reads stories involving shoes (or the plight ofthe barefoot), and so on.This substitutes the accidental concrete of an arbitrarily picked “theme” forthe conceptual integration of the content of one discipline with that ofanother—thus conditioning the students’ minds to the concrete-bound,associational method of functioning, while they are dealing with conceptualmaterial. Knowledge acquired in that manner cannot be retained beyond the nextexam, and sometimes not even that long.The indoctrination of children with a mob spirit—under the category of “socialadjustment”—is conducted openly and explicitly. The supremacy of the pack isdrilled, pounded and forced into the student’s mind by every means available tothe comprachicos of the classroom, including the contemptible policy of gradingthe students on their social adaptability (under various titles). No bettermethod than this type of grading could be devised to destroy a child’sindividuality and turn him into a stale little conformist, to stunt his unformedsense of personal identity and make him blend into an anonymous mob, to penalizethe best, the most intelligent and honest children in the class, and to rewardthe worst, the dull, the lethargic, the dishonest.Still more evil (because more fundamental) is the “discussion” method ofteaching, which is used more frequently in the humanities than in the physicalsciences, for obvious reasons. Following this method, the teacher abstains fromlecturing and merely presides at a free-for-all or “bull session,” while thestudents express their “views” on the subject under study, which they do notknow and have come to school to learn. What these sessions produce in the mindsof the students is an unbearable boredom.But this is much worse than a mere waste of the students’ time. They are beingtaught some crucial things, though not the ostensible subject of study. They arebeing given a lesson in metaphysics and epistemology. They are being taught, byimplication, that there is no such thing as a firm, objective reality, whichman’s mind must learn to perceive correctly; that reality is an indeterminateflux and can be anything the pack wants it to be; that truth or falsehood isdetermined by majority vote. And more: that knowledge is unnecessary andirrelevant, since the teacher’s views have no greater validity than the oratoryof the dullest and most ignorant student—and, therefore, that reason, thinking,intelligence and education are of no importance or value. To the extent that astudent absorbs these notions, what incentive would he have to continue hiseducation and to develop his mind? The answer may be seen today on any collegecampus.As to the content of the courses in the grade and high schools, theanti-rational indoctrination is carried on in the form of slanted, distortedmaterial, of mystic-altruist-collectivist slogans, of propaganda for thesupremacy of emotions over reason—but this is merely a process of cashing in onthe devastation wrought in the children’s psycho-epistemology. Most of thestudents do graduate as full-fledged little collectivists, reciting theappropriate dogma, but one cannot say that this represents their convictions.The truth is much worse than that: they are incapable of holding any convictionsof any kind, and they gravitate to collectivism because that is what they havememorized—and also because one does not turn to reason and independence out offear, helplessness and self-doubt.IIINo matter what premises a child may form in his grade- and high-school years,the educational system works to multiply his inner conflicts.The graduates of the Progressive nurseries are caught in the clash between theirdazed, unfocused, whim-oriented psycho-epistemology and the demands of reality,with which they are not prepared to deal. They are expected to acquire some sortof formal knowledge, to pass exams, to achieve acceptable grades, i.e., tocomply with some minimal factual norms—but, to them, it is a metaphysicalbetrayal. Facts are what they have been trained to ignore; facts cannot belearned by the kind of mental process they have automatized: by an animal-likemethod of catching the emotional cues emitted by the pack. The pack is stillthere, but it cannot help them at examination time—which they have to face in astate they have been taught to regard as evil: alone.The panic of the conflict between their foggy subjectivism and the rudiments ofobjectivity left in the schools by a civilized past, leads to a namelessresentment in the minds of such children, to a wordless feeling that they arebeing unfairly imposed upon—they do not know how or by whom—to a growinghostility without object. The comprachicos, in due time, will offer them anobject.Some of the brighter children—those who are mentally active and do want to learnare caught in a different conflict. Struggling to integrate the chaotic snatchesof information taught in their classes, they discover the omissions, the nonsequiturs, the contradictions, which are seldom explained or resolved. Theirquestions are usually ignored or resented or laughed at or evaded by means ofexplanations that confuse the issue further. A child may give up, inbewilderment, concluding that the pursuit of knowledge is senseless, thateducation is an enormous pretense of some evil kind which he cannotunderstand—and thus he is started on the road to anti-intellectuality and mentalstagnation. Or a child may conclude that the school will give him nothing, thathe must learn on his own—which is the best conclusion to draw in thecircumstances, except that it can lead him to a profound contempt for teachers,for other adults and, often, for all men (which is the road to subjectivism).The “socializing” aspects of the school, the pressure to conform to the pack,are, for him, a special kind of torture. A thinking child cannot conform—thoughtdoes not bow to authority. The resentment of the pack toward intelligence andindependence is older than Progressive education; it is an ancient evil (amongchildren and adults alike), a product of fear, self-doubt and envy. ButPragmatism, the father of Progressive education, is a Kantian philosophy anduses Kant’s technique of cashing in on human weaknesses and fears.Instead of teaching children respect for one another’s individuality,achievements and rights, Progressive education gives an official stamp of moralrighteousness to the tendency of frightened half-savages to gang up on oneanother, to form “in-groups” and to persecute the outsider. When, on top of it,the outsider is penalized or reprimanded for his inability to “get along withpeople,” the rule of mediocrity is elevated into a system. (“Mediocrity” doesnot mean an average intelligence; it means an average intelligence that resentsand envies its betters.) Progressive education has institutionalized anEstablishment of Envy.The thinking child is not antisocial (he is, in fact, the only type of child fitfor social relationships). When he develops his first values and consciousconvictions, particularly as he approaches adolescence, he feels an intensedesire to share them with a friend who would understand him; if frustrated, hefeels an acute sense of loneliness. (Loneliness is specifically the experienceof this type of child—or adult; it is the experience of those who have somethingto offer. The emotion that drives conformists to “belong,” is not loneliness,but fear—the fear of intellectual independence and responsibility. The thinkingchild seeks equals; the conformist seeks protectors.)One of the most evil aspects of modern schools is the spectacle of a thinkingchild trying to “adjust” to the pack, trying to hide his intelligence (and hisscholastic grades) and to act like “one of the boys.” He never succeeds, and isleft wondering helplessly: “What is wrong with me? What do I lack? What do theywant?” He has no way of knowing that his lack consists in thinking of suchquestions. The questions imply that there are reasons, causes, principles,values—which are the very things the pack mentality dreads, evades and resents.He has no way of knowing that one’s psycho-epistemology cannot be hidden, thatit shows in many subtle ways, and that the pack rejects him because they sensehis factual (i.e., judging) orientation, his psycho-epistemologicalself-confidence and lack of fear. (Existentially, such loners lack socialself-confidence and, more often than not, are afraid of the pack, but the issueis not existential.)Gradually, the thinking child gives up the realm of human relationships. Hedraws the conclusion that he can understand science, but not people, that peopleare unknowable, that they are outside the province of reason, that some othercognitive means are required, which he lacks. Thus he comes to accept a falsedichotomy, best designated as reason versus people, which his teachers arestriving to instill and reinforce.The conformists, in the face of that dichotomy, give up reason; he gives uppeople. Repressing his need of friendship, he gives up concern with humanvalues, with moral questions, with social issues, with the entire realm of thehumanities. Seeking rationality, objectivity and intelligibility—i.e., a realmwhere he can function—he escapes into the physical sciences or technology orbusiness, i.e., into the professions that deal primarily with matter rather thanwith man. (This is a major cause of America’s “brain drain,” of the appallingintellectual poverty in the humanities, with the best minds running—fortemporary protection—to the physical sciences.)There is nothing wrong, of course, in choosing a career in the physicalprofessions, if such is one’s rational preference. But it is a tragic error if ayoung man chooses it as an escape, because the escape is illusory. Since thedichotomy he accepted is false, since repression is not a solution to anything,but merely an impairment of his mental capacity, the psychological price he paysis nameless fear, unearned guilt, self-doubt, neurosis, and, more often thannot, indifference, suspicion or hostility toward people. The result, in hiscase, is the exact opposite of the social harmony the comprachicos ofProgressive education had promised to achieve.There are children who succumb to another, similar dichotomy: values versuspeople. Prompted by loneliness, unable to know that the pleasure one finds inhuman companionship is possible only on the grounds of holding the same values,a child may attempt to reverse cause and effect: he places companionship firstand tries to adopt the values of others, repressing his own half-formedvalue-judgments, in the belief that this will bring him friends. The dogma ofconformity to the pack encourages and reinforces his moral self-abnegation.Thereafter, he struggles blindly to obtain from people some satisfaction whichhe cannot define (and which cannot be found), to alleviate a sense of guilt hecannot name, to fill a vacuum he is unable to identify. He alternates betweenabject compliance with his friends’ wishes, and peremptory demands foraffection—he becomes the kind of emotional dependent that no friends of anypersuasion could stand for long. The more he fails, the more desperately heclings to his pursuit of people and “love.” But the nameless emotion growing inhis subconscious, never to be admitted or identified, is hatred for people. Theresult, again, is the opposite of the comprachicos’ alleged goal.No matter what their individual problems or what defenses they choose, all thechildren—from the “adjusted” to the independent—suffer from a common blight intheir grade- and high-school years: boredom. Their reasons vary, but theemotional result is the same. Learning is a conceptual process; an educationalmethod devised to ignore, bypass and contradict the requirements of conceptualdevelopment, cannot arouse any interest in learning. The “adjusted” are boredbecause they are unable actively to absorb knowledge. The independent are boredbecause they seek knowledge, not games of “class projects” or group“discussions.” The first are unable to digest their lessons; the second arestarved.The comprachicos succeed in either case. The independent children, who resistthe conditioning and preserve some part of their rationality, are predominantlyshunted, or self-exiled, into the physical sciences and allied professions, awayfrom social, philosophical or humanistic concerns. The social field—and thussociety’s future—is left to the “adjusted,” to the stunted, twisted, mutilatedminds the comprachicos’ technique was intended to produce.The average high-school graduate is a jerky, anxious, incoherent youth with amind like a scarecrow made of sundry patches that cannot be integrated into anyshape. He has no concept of knowledge: he does not know when he knows and whenhe does not know. His chronic fear is of what he is supposed to know, and hispretentious posturing is intended to hide the fact that he hasn’t the faintestidea. He alternates between oracular pronouncements and blankly evasive silence.He assumes the pose of an authority on the latest, journalistic issues inpolitics (part of his “class projects”) and recites the canned bromides ofthird-rate editorials as if they were his original discoveries. He does not knowhow to read or write or consult a dictionary. He is sly and “wise”; he has thecynicism of a decadent adult, and the credulity of a child. He is loud,aggressive, belligerent. His main concern is to prove that he is afraid ofnothing—because he is scared to death of everything.His mind is in a state of whirling confusion. He has never learned toconceptualize, i.e., to identify, to organize, to integrate the content of hismind. In school and out, he has observed and experienced (or, more precisely,been exposed to) many things, and he cannot tell their meaning or import, hedoes not know what to make of them, sensing dimly that he should make somethingsomehow. He does not know where to begin; he feels chronically behind himself,unable to catch up with his own mental content—as if the task of untangling itwere far beyond his capacity.Since he was prevented from conceptualizing his cognitive material step by step,as he acquired it, the accumulation of unidentified experiences and perceptualimpressions is now such that he feels paralyzed. When he tries to think, hismind runs into a blank wall every few steps; his mental processes seem todissolve in a labyrinth of question marks and blind alleys. His subconscious,like an unattended basement, is cluttered with the irrelevant, the accidental,the misunderstood, the ungrasped, the undefined, the not-fully-remembered; itdoes not respond to his mental efforts. He gives up.The secret of his psycho-epistemology-which baffles those who deal with him—liesin the fact that, as an adult, he has to use concepts, but he uses concepts by achild’s perceptual method. He uses them as concretes, as the immediatelygiven—without context, definitions, integrations or specific referents; his onlycontext is the immediate moment. To what, then, do his concepts refer? To afoggy mixture of partial knowledge, memorized responses, habitual associations,his audience’s reactions and his own feelings, which represent the content ofhis mind at that particular moment. On the next day or occasion, the sameconcepts will refer to different things, according to the changes in his moodand in the immediate circumstances.He seems able to understand a discussion or a rational argument, sometimes evenon an abstract, theoretical level. He is able to participate, to agree ordisagree after what appears to be a critical examination of the issue. But thenext time one meets him, the conclusions he reached are gone from his mind, asif the discussion had never occurred even though he remembers it: he remembersthe event, i.e., a discussion, not its intellectual content.It is beside the point to accuse him of hypocrisy or lying (though some part ofboth is necessarily involved). His problem is much worse than that: he wassincere, he meant what he said in and for that moment. But it ended with thatmoment. Nothing happens in his mind to an idea he accepts or rejects; there isno processing, no integration, no application to himself, his actions or hisconcerns; he is unable to use it or even to retain it. Ideas, i.e.,abstractions, have no reality to him; abstractions involve the past and thefuture, as well as the present; nothing is fully real to him except the present.Concepts, in his mind, become percepts—percepts of people uttering sounds; andpercepts end when the stimuli vanish. When he uses words, his mental operationsare closer to those of a parrot than of a human being. In the strict sense ofthe word, he has not learned to speak.But there is one constant in his mental flux. The subconscious is an integratingmechanism; when left without conscious control, it goes on integrating on itsown—and, like an automatic blender, his subconscious squeezes its clutter oftrash to produce a single basic emotion: fear.He is not equipped to earn a living in a primitive village, but he finds himselfin the midst of the brilliant complexity of an industrial, technologicalcivilization, which he cannot begin to understand. He senses that something isdemanded of him—by his parents, by his friends, by people at large, and, sincehe is a living organism, by his own restless energy—something he is unable todeliver.He has been trained to react, not to act; to respond, not to initiate; to pursuepleasure, not purpose. He is a playboy without money, taste or the capacity ofenjoyment. He is guided by his feelings—he has nothing else. And his feelingsare only various shades of panic.He cannot turn for help to his parents. In most cases, they are unable and/orunwilling to understand him; he distrusts them and he is too inarticulate toexplain anything. What he needs is rational guidance; what they offer him istheir own brand of irrationality. If they are old-fashioned, they tell him thathe is too self-indulgent and it’s about time he came down to earth and assumedsome responsibility; for moral guidance, they say, he ought to go to church. Ifthey are modern, they tell him that he takes himself too seriously and ought tohave more fun; for moral guidance, they tell him that nobody is ever fully rightor fully wrong, and take him to a cocktail party raising funds for some liberalcause.His parents are the products of the same educational system, but at an earlierstage, at a time when the school conditioning was furtively indirect, andrational influences still existed in the culture—which permitted them to getaway with discarding intellectual concerns and playing the fashionable game ofundercutting reason, while believing that somebody else would always be there toprovide them with a civilized world.Of any one group involved, it is not the comprachicos who are the guiltiest, itis the parents—particularly the educated ones who could afford to send theirchildren to Progressive nursery schools. Such parents would do anything fortheir children, except give them a moment’s thought or an hour’s criticalinquiry into the nature of the educational institutions to be selected. Promptedchiefly by the desire to get the children off their hands and out of their way,they selected schools as they select clothes—according to the latest fashion.The comprachicos do not hide their theories and methods; they propagate themopenly, in countless books, lectures, magazines and school brochures. Theirtheme is clear: they attack the intellect and proclaim their hatred ofreason—the rest is gush and slush. Anyone who delivers a helpless child intotheir hands, does so because he shares their motives. Mistakes of this size arenot made innocently.There is, however, an innocent group of parents: the hard-working, uneducatedones who want to give their children a better chance in life and a brighterfuture than their own. These parents spend a lifetime in poverty, struggling,skimping, saving, working overtime to send their children through school(particularly, through college). They have a profound respect for the educatedpeople, for teachers, for learning. They would not be able to conceive of thecomprachico mentality—to imagine an educator who works, not to enlighten, but tocripple their children. Such parents are the victims of as vicious a fraud asany recorded in criminal history.(This last is one of the reasons to question the motives—and the compassion—ofthose unemployed busy-bodies who flitter about, protecting consumers fromoversized breakfast-cereal boxes. What about the consumers of education?)If you want to grasp what the comprachicos’ methods have done to the mind of ahigh-school graduate, remember that the intellect is often compared to thefaculty of sight. Try to project what you would feel if your eyesight weredamaged in such a way that you were left with nothing but peripheral vision. Youwould sense vague, unidentifiable shapes floating around you, which would vanishwhen you tried to focus on them, then would reappear on the periphery and swimand switch and multiply. This is the mental state—and the terror—produced intheir students by the comprachicos of Progressive education.Can such a youth recondition his mental processes? It is possible, but theautomatization of a conceptual method of functioning—which, in hisnursery-school years, would have been an easy, joyous, natural process——wouldnow require an excruciatingly difficult effort.As an illustration of the consequences of delaying nature’s timetable, considerthe following. In our infancy, all of us had to learn and automatize the skillof integrating into percepts the material provided by our various sense organs.It was a natural, painless process which—as we can infer by observing infants—wewere eager to learn. But medical science has recorded cases of children who wereborn blind and later, in their youth or adulthood, underwent an operation thatrestored their sight. Such persons are not able to see, i.e., they experiencesensations of sight, but cannot perceive objects. For example, they recognize atriangle by touch, but cannot connect it to the sight of a triangle; the sightconveys nothing to them. The ability to see is not innate—it is a skill that hasto be acquired. But the material provided by these persons’ other senses is sothoroughly integrated and automatized that they are unable instantly to break itup to add a new element, vision. This integration now requires such a long,difficult process of retraining that few of them choose to undertake it. Thesefew succeed, after a heroically persevering struggle. The rest give up,preferring to stay in their familiar world of touch and sound—to remainsightless for life.An unusual kind of moral strength and of personal ambition (i.e., ofself-esteem) is required to regain one’s sight: a profound love of life, apassionate refusal to remain a cripple, an intense dedication to the task ofachieving the best within one’s reach. The reward is commensurate.The same kind of dedication and as difficult a struggle are required of a modemhigh-school graduate to regain his rational faculty. The reward is as great—orgreater. In the midst of his chronic anxiety, he is still able to experiencesome moments of freedom, to catch a few glimpses of what life would be like in ajoyous state of self-confidence. And one thing he does know for certain: thatthere is something wrong with him. He has a springboard—a slender, precariousone, but still a springboard—for an incentive to recapture the use of his mind.The comprachicos destroy that incentive in the third stage of their job: incollege.IVMost young people retain some hold on their rational faculty—or, at least, someunidentified desire to retain it—until their early twenties, approximately untiltheir post-college years. The symptom of that desire is their quest for acomprehensive view of life.It is man’s rational faculty that integrates his cognitive material and enableshim to understand it; his only means of understanding is conceptual. Aconsciousness, like any other vital faculty, cannot accept its own impotencewithout protest. No matter how badly disorganized, a young person’s mind stillgropes for answers to fundamental questions, sensing that all of its contenthangs precariously in a vacuum.This is not a matter of “idealism,” but of psycho-epistemological necessity. Onthe conscious level, the countless alternatives confronting him make a youngperson aware of the fact that he has to make choices and that he does not knowwhat to choose or how to act. On the subconscious level, his psycho-epistemologyhas not yet automatized a lethargic resignation to a state of chronic suffering(which is the “solution” of most adults)—and the painful conflicts of his innercontradictions, of his self-doubt, of his impotent confusion, make him searchfrantically for some form of inner unity and mental order. His quest representsthe last convulsions of his cognitive faculty at the approach of atrophy, like alast cry of protest.For the few brief years of his adolescence, a young person’s future is urgently,though dimly, real to him; he senses that he has to determine it in some unknownway.A thinking youth has a vague glimmer of the nature of his need. It is expressedin his concern with broad philosophical questions, particularly with moralissues (i.e., with a code of values to guide his actions). An average youthmerely feels helpless, and his erratic restlessness is a form of escape from thedesperate feeling that “things ought to make sense.”By the time they are ready for college, both types of youths have been hurt, inand out of school, by countless clashes with the irrationality of their eldersand of today’s culture. The thinking youth has been frustrated in his longing tofind people who take ideas seriously; but he believes that he will find them incollege—in the alleged citadel of reason and wisdom. The average youth feelsthat things do not make sense to him, but they do to someone somewhere in theworld, and someone will make the world intelligible to him someday.For both of them, college is the last hope. They lose it in their freshman year.It is generally known in academic circles that, according to surveys, thestudents’ interest in their studies is greatest in their freshman year anddiminishes progressively each year thereafter. The educators deplore it, but donot question the nature of the courses they are giving.With rare exceptions, which are lost in the academic “mainstream,” collegecourses in the humanities do not provide the students with knowledge, but withthe conviction that it is wrong, naive or futile to seek knowledge. What theyprovide is not information, but rationalization—the rationalization of thestudents’ concrete-bound, perceptual, emotion-oriented method of mentalfunctioning. The courses are designed to protect the status quo—not theexistential, political or social status quo, but the miserable status quo of thestudents’ psycho-epistemology, as laid down in the Progressive nursery schools.The Progressive nurseries pleaded for a delay of the process of education,asserting that cognitive training is premature for a young child—and conditionedhis mind to an anti-cognitive method of functioning. The grade and high schoolsreinforced the conditioning: struggling helplessly with random snatches ofknowledge, the student learned to associate a sense of dread, resentment andself-doubt with the process of learning. College completes the job, declaringexplicitly—to a receptive audience—that there is nothing to learn, that realityis unknowable, certainty is unattainable, the mind is an instrument ofself-deception, and the sole function of reason is to find conclusive proof ofits own impotence.Even though philosophy is held in a (today) well-earned contempt by the othercollege departments, it is philosophy that determines the nature and directionof all the other courses, because it is philosophy that formulates theprinciples of epistemology, i.e., the rules by which men are to acquireknowledge. The influence of the dominant philosophic theories permeates everyother department, including the physical sciences—and becomes the more dangerousbecause accepted subconsciously. The philosophic theories of the past twohundred years, since Immanuel Kant, seem to justify the attitude of those whodismiss philosophy as empty, inconsequential verbiage. But this precisely is thedanger: surrendering philosophy (i.e., the foundations of knowledge) to thepurveyors of empty verbiage is far from inconsequential. It is particularly tophilosophy that one must apply the advice of Ellsworth Toohey in TheFountainhead: “Don’t bother to examine a folly, ask yourself only what itaccomplishes.”Consider the progressive stages of modern philosophy, not from the aspect of itsphilosophic content, but of its psycho-epistemological goals.When Pragmatism declares that reality is an indeterminate flux which can beanything people want it to be, nobody accepts it literally. But it strikes anote of emotional recognition in the mind of a Progressive nursery graduate,because it seems to justify a feeling he has not been able to explain: theomnipotence of the pack. So he accepts it as true in some indeterminate way—tobe used when and as needed. When Pragmatism declares that truth is to be judgedby consequences, it justifies his inability to project the future, to plan hiscourse of action long-range, and sanctions his wish to act on the spur of themoment, to try anything once and then discover whether he can get away with itor not.When Logical Positivism declares that “reality,” “identity,” “existence,” “mind”are meaningless terms, that man can be certain of nothing but the sensoryperceptions of the immediate moment—when it declares that the meaning of theproposition: “Napoleon lost the battle of Waterloo” is your walk to the librarywhere you read it in a book—the Progressive nursery graduate recognizes it as anexact description of his inner state and as a justification of hisconcrete-bound, perceptual mentality.When Linguistic Analysis declares that the ultimate reality is not evenpercepts, but words, and that words have no specific referents, but meanwhatever people want them to mean, the Progressive graduate finds himselfhappily back at home, in the familiar world of his nursery school. He does nothave to struggle to grasp an incomprehensible reality, all he has to do is focuson people and watch for the vibrations of how they use words—and compete withhis fellow philosophers in how many different vibrations he is able to discover.And more: armed with the prestige of philosophy, he can now tell people whatthey mean when they speak, which they are unable to know without hisassistance—i.e., he can appoint himself interpreter of the will of the pack.What had once been a little manipulator now grows to the fullpsycho-epistemological stature of a shyster lawyer.And more: Linguistic Analysis is vehemently opposed to all the intellectualfeats he is unable to perform. It is opposed to any kinds of principles or broadgeneralizations—i.e., to consistency. It is opposed to basic axioms (as“analytic” and “redundant”)—i.e., to the necessity of any grounds for one’sassertions. It is opposed to the hierarchical structure of concepts (i.e., tothe process of abstraction) and regards any word as an isolated primary (i.e.,as a perceptually given concrete). It is opposed to “system-building” —i.e., tothe integration of knowledge.The Progressive nursery graduate thus finds all his psycho-epistemological flawstransformed into virtues—and, instead of hiding them as a guilty secret, he canflaunt them as proof of his intellectual superiority. As to the students who didnot attend a Progressive nursery, they are now worked over to make them equalhis mental status.It is the claim of Linguistic Analysis that its purpose is not the communicationof any particular philosophic content, but the training of a student’s mind.This is true—in the terrible, butchering sense of a comprachico operation. Thedetailed discussions of inconsequential minutiae—the discourses on trivia pickedat random and in midstream, without base, context or conclusion—the shocks ofself-doubt at the professor’s sudden revelations of some such fact as thestudents’ inability to define the word “but,” which, he claims, proves that theydo not understand their own statements—the countering of the question: “What isthe meaning of philosophy?” with: “Which sense of ‘meaning’ do you mean?”followed by a discourse on twelve possible uses of the word “meaning,” by whichtime the question is lost—and, above all, the necessity to shrink one’s focus tothe range of a flea’s, and to keep it there—will cripple the best of minds, ifit attempts to comply.“Mind-training” pertains to psycho-epistemology; it consists in making a mindautomatize certain processes, turning them into permanent habits. What habitsdoes Linguistic Analysis inculcate? Context-dropping, “concept-stealing,”disintegration, purposelessness, the inability to grasp, retain or deal withabstractions. Linguistic Analysis is not a philosophy, it is a method ofeliminating the capacity for philosophical thought—it is a course inbrain-destruction, a systematic attempt to turn a rational animal into an animalunable to reason.Why? What is the comprachicos’ motive?To paraphrase Victor Hugo: “And what did they make of these children?“Monsters.“Why monsters?“To rule.”Man’s mind is his basic means of survival—and of self-protection. Reason is themost selfish human faculty: it has to be used in and by a man’s own mind, andits product—truth—makes him inflexible, intransigent, impervious to the power ofany pack or any ruler. Deprived of the ability to reason, man becomes a docile,pliant, impotent chunk of clay, to be shaped into any subhuman form and used forany purpose by anyone who wants to bother.There has never been a philosophy, a theory or a doctrine that attacked (or“limited”) reason, which did not also preach submission to the power of someauthority. Philosophically, most men do not understand the issue to this day;but psycho-epistemologically, they have sensed it since prehistoric times.Observe the nature of mankind’s earliest legends—such as the fall of Lucifer,“the light-bearer,” for the sin of defying authority; or the story ofPrometheus, who taught men the practical arts of survival. Power-seekers havealways known that if men are to be made submissive, the obstacle is not theirfeelings, their wishes or their “instincts,” but their minds; if men are to beruled, then the enemy is reason.Power-lust is a psycho-epistemological matter. It is not confined to potentialdictators or aspiring politicians. It can be experienced, chronically orsporadically, by men in any profession, on any level of intellectualdevelopment. It is experienced by shriveled scholars, by noisy playboys, byshabby office managers, by pretentious millionaires, by droning teachers, bycocktail-chasing mothers—by anyone who, having uttered an assertion, confrontsthe direct glance of a man or a child and hears the words: “But that is nottrue.” Those who, in such moments, feel the desire, not to persuade, but toforce the mind behind the direct eyes, are the legions that make thecomprachicos possible.Not all of the modern teachers are consciously motivated by power-lust, though agreat many of them are. Not all of them are consciously aware of the goal ofobliterating reason by crippling the minds of their students. Some aspire tonothing but the mean little pleasure of fooling and defeating too intelligently,persistently inquiring a student. Some seek nothing but to hide and evade theholes and contradictions in their own intellectual equipment. Some had neversought anything but a safe, undemanding, respectable position—and would notdream of contradicting the majority of their colleagues or of their textbooks.Some are eaten by envy of the rich, the famous, the successful, the independent.Some believe (or try to believe) the thin veneer of humanitarianrationalizations coating the theories of Kant or John Dewey. And all of them areproducts of the same educational system in its earlier stages.The system is self-perpetuating: it leads to many vicious circles. There arepromising, intelligent teachers who are driven to despair by the obtuse,lethargic, invincibly unthinking mentalities of their students. The grade- andhigh-school teachers blame it on parental influences; the college professorsblame it on the grade-and high-school teachers. Few, if any, question thecontent of the courses. After struggling for a few years, these better teachersgive up and retire, or become convinced that reason is beyond the grasp of mostmen, and remain as bitterly indifferent camp followers of the comprachicos’advance.But the comprachico leaders past and present—are aware of their own motives. Itis impossible to be consumed by a single passion without knowing its nature, nomatter what rationalizations one constructs to hide it from oneself. If you wantto see hatred, do not look at wars or concentration camps—these are merely itsconsequences. Look at the writings of Kant, Dewey, Marcuse and their followersto see pure hatred—hatred of reason and of everything it implies: ofintelligence, of ability, of achievement, of success, of self-confidence, ofself-esteem, of every bright, happy, benevolent aspect of man. This is theatmosphere, the leitmotif, the sense of life permeating today’s educationalestablishment.(What brings a human being to the state of a comprachico? Self-loathing. Thedegree of a man’s hatred for reason is the measure of his hatred for himself.)A comprachico leader does not aspire to the role of political dictator. Heleaves it to his heir: the mindless brute. The comprachicos are not concernedwith establishing anything. The obliteration of reason is their single passionand goal. What comes afterward has no reality to them; dimly, they fancythemselves as the masters who will pull the strings behind the ruler’s throne:the brute, they feel, will need them. (That they end up as terrorizedbootlickers at the brute’s court and at his mercy, as in Nazi Germany and SovietRussia, is merely an instance of reality’s justice.)Power-lust requires guinea pigs, to develop the techniques of inculcatingobedience—and cannon fodder that will obey the orders. College students fillboth roles. Psycho-epistemological flattery is the most potent technique to useon a person with a damaged brain. The Progressive nursery graduate’s last linkto rationality—the feeling that there is something wrong with him—is cut off incollege. There is nothing wrong with him, he is told, his is the healthy,natural state, he is merely unable to function in a “System” that ignores humannature; he is normal, the “System” is abnormal.The term “System” is left undefined, at first; it may be the educational system,the cultural system, the private family system—anything that a student mightblame for his inner misery. This induces a paranoid mood, the feeling that he isan innocent victim persecuted by some dark, mysterious powers—which builds up inhim a blind, helpless rage. The theories of determinism—with which he isbattered in most of his courses—intensify and justify his mood: if he ismiserable, he cannot help it, they tell him, he cannot help anything he feels ordoes, he is a product of society and society has made a bad job of it. By thetime he hears that all his troubles—from poor grades to sexual problems tochronic anxiety—are caused by the political system and that the enemy iscapitalism, he accepts it as self-evident.The methods of teaching are essentially the same as those used in high school,only more so. The curriculum is an embodiment of disintegration—a hodgepodge ofrandom subjects, without continuity, context or purpose. It is like a series ofBalkanized kingdoms, offering a survey course of floating abstractions or anoverdetailed study of a professor’s favorite minutiae, with the borders closedto the kingdom in the next classroom, with no connections, no bridges, no maps.Maps—i.e., systematization—are forbidden on principle. Cramming and memorizingare the students’ only psycho-epistemological means of getting through. (Thereare graduates in philosophy who can recite the differences between the early andlate Wittgenstein, but have never had a course on Aristotle. There are graduatesin psychology who have puttered about with rats in mazes, with knee-jerkingreflexes and with statistics, but never got to an actual study of humanpsychology.)The “discussion” seminars are part of the technique of flattery: when anignorant adolescent is asked to air his views on a subject he has not studied,he gets the message that the status of college student has transformed him froman ignoramus into an authority—and that the significance of any opinion lies inthe fact that somebody holds it, with no reasons, knowledge or groundsnecessary. (This helps to justify the importance of watching for the vibrationsof the pack.)Such “discussions” advance another purpose of the comprachico technique: thebreeding of hostility—the encouragement of criticism rather than creativeness.In the absence of any reasoned views, the students develop the knack of blastingeach other’s nonsense (which is not difficult in the circumstances) and come toregard the demolition of a bad argument as the equivalent of the construction ofa good one. (The example is set by the professors who, in their own publicationsand debates, are often brilliant at demolishing one another’s irrationaltheories, but fall flat in attempting to present a new theory of their own.) Inthe absence of intellectual content, the students resort to personal attacks,practicing with impunity the old fallacy of ad hominem, substituting insults forarguments—with hooligan rudeness and four-letter words accepted as part of theirfreedom of speech. Thus malice is protected, ideas are not. The unimportance ofideas is further stressed by the demand that the nature of such “discussions” beignored and the participants remain “good friends”—no matter what offensiveexchanges took place—in the name of “intellectual tolerance.”An eloquent demonstration of today’s general contempt for the power of ideas isoffered by the fact that people did not expect an education of this kind toproduce any consequences—and are now shocked by the spectacle of collegestudents putting into practice what they have been taught. If, after such atraining, the students demand the power to run the universities, why shouldn’tthey? They were given that power intellectually and decided to exercise itexistentially. They were regarded as qualified arbiters of ideas, withoutknowledge, preparation or experience—and they decided that they were qualifiedadministrators, without knowledge, preparation or experience.The students’ demand that their courses be “relevant” to their actual lives hasa badly twisted element of validity. The only purpose of education is to teach astudent how to live his life—by developing his mind and equipping him to dealwith reality. The training he needs is theoretical, i.e., conceptual. He has tobe taught to think, to understand, to integrate, to prove. He has to be taughtthe essentials of the knowledge discovered in the past—and he has to be equippedto acquire further knowledge by his own effort. All of this is what the collegeshave renounced, failed in and defaulted on long ago. What they are teachingtoday has no relevance to anything—neither to theory nor practice nor realitynor human life.But—in keeping with their concrete-bound psycho-epistemology—what the studentsregard as “relevant” are such things as courses in “community action,” airpollution, rat-control and guerrilla warfare. Their criteria for determining acollege curriculum are the newspaper headlines of the immediate moment, theirhierarchy of concerns is established by tabloid editorials, their notion ofreality does not extend beyond the latest TV talk-show. Modem intellectuals usedto denounce the influence of comic strips on children; the progress theyachieved consists in pushing the children’s interest to the front pages andfreezing it there for life.The conditioning phase of the comprachicos’ task is completed. The students’development is arrested, their minds are set to respond to slogans, as animalsrespond to a trainer’s whistle, their brains are embalmed in the syrup ofaltruism as an automatic substitute for self-esteem—they have nothing left butthe terror of chronic anxiety, the blind urge to act, to strike out at whoevercaused it, and a boiling hostility against the whole of the universe. They wouldobey anyone, they need a master, they need to be told what to do. They are readynow to be used as cannon fodder—to attack, to bomb, to burn, to murder, to fightin the streets and die in the gutters. They are a trained pack of miserablyimpotent freaks, ready to be unleashed against anyone. The comprachicos unleashthem against the “System.”VIn the avalanche of commentaries on the campus riots, a great deal has been saidabout the students, as if those manifestations of savagery were spontaneous, andabout the college administrators, as if their policies of abject appeasementwere “repressive” —but very little is said about the faculties. Yet it is thefaculty that causes, inspires, manipulates and often stage-manages the riots. Insome cases, the majority of the faculty supports the rioters; in others, it is asmall comprachico minority that overpowers the faculty majority by spitting inits face. (And if you want to see a negative demonstration of the power ofideas—i.e., a demonstration of what happens to men devoid of philosophicalconvictions—take a look at the cringing moral cowardice of allegedly civilizedscholars in the presence of a handful of faculty hooligans. There have beennotable exceptions to this attitude, but not many.)For several generations, the destruction of reason was carried on under thecover and in the name of reason, which was the Kant-Hegel-James-Dewey method.When every girder of rationality had been undercut, a new philosophy madeexplicit what had been implicit, and took over the job of providing arationalization of the students’ psycho-epistemological state: Existentialism.Existentialism elevates chronic anxiety into the realm of metaphysics. Fear,misery, nausea—it declares—are not an individual’s fault, they are inherent inhuman nature, they are an intrinsic, predestined part of the “human condition.”Action is the sole alleviation possible to man. What action? Any action. You donot know how to act? Don’t be chicken, courage consists in acting withoutknowledge. You do not know what goals to choose? There are no standards ofchoice. Virtue consists in choosing a goal by whim and sticking to it(“committing yourself”) to the grim death. It sounds unreasonable? Reason isman’s enemy—your guts, muscles and blood know best.For several generations, the destruction of freedom (i.e., of capitalism) wascarried on under the cover and in the name of freedom. The genteel intellectualconformists, mass-produced in colleges, proclaimed every collectivist tenet,premise and slogan, while professing their abhorrence of dictatorship. Whenevery girder of capitalism had been undercut, when it had been transformed intoa crumbling mixed economy—i.e., a state of civil war among pressure groupsfighting politely for the legalized privilege of using physical force—the roadwas cleared for a philosopher who scrapped the politeness and the legality,making explicit what had been implicit: Herbert Marcuse, the avowed enemy ofreason and freedom, the advocate of dictatorship, of mystic “insight,” ofretrogression to savagery, of universal enslavement, of rule by brute force.The student activists are the comprachicos’ most successful products: they wentobediently along every step of the way, never challenging the basic premisesinculcated in the Progressive nursery schools. They act in packs, with the willof the pack as their only guide. The scramble for power among their pack leadersand among different packs does not make them question their premises: they areincapable of questioning anything. So they cling to the belief that mankind canbe united into one happily, harmoniously unanimous pack—by force. Brute,physical force is, to them, a natural form of action. Philosophically, it isclear that when men abandon reason, physical force becomes their only means ofdealing with one another and of settling disagreements. The activists are theliving demonstration of this principle.The activists’ claim that they have no way of “attracting attention” to theirdemands and of getting what they want except by force—by violent demonstrations,obstruction and destruction—is a pure throwback to the Progressive nurseryschool, where a tantrum was the only thing required to achieve their wishes.Their hysterical screaming still carries a touch of pouting astonishment at aworld that does not respond to an absolute such as: “I want it!” Thethree-year-old whim-worshiper becomes the twenty-year-old thug.The activists are a small minority, but they are confronting a helpless,confused, demoralized majority consisting of those who were unable fully toaccept the school conditioning or fully to reject it. Among them, a large grouprepresents the activists’ fellow travelers and prospective converts: thehippies. The hippies froze on the Progressive nursery school level and went nofurther. They took the Progressive nursery’s metaphysics literally—and are nowwandering in search of a world to fit it.The hippies’ “lifestyle” is an exact concretization of the nursery’s ideal: nothought—no focus—no purpose—no work—no reality save the whim of the moment—thehypnotic monotony of primitive music, with the even beat that deadens the brainand the senses—the brotherhood of the pack, combined with pretensions atexpressing individuality, at “doing one’s thing” in the haze and stench of grimycoffeehouses, which “thing” consists in the monotonous repetition of the samejerking contortions with the same long whine of sounds that had been emitted byothers for days on end—the inarticulate extolling of emotions above reason, of“spirituality” above matter, of “nature” above technology—and, above all, thequest for love, anyone’s love, any kind of love as the key to finding someonewho will take care of them.Clinging to their nursery ideal, the hippies live down to its essential demand:non-effort. If they are not provided with brightly furnished rooms and toys,they live in dank basements, they sleep on floors, they eat what they find ingarbage cans, they breed stomach ulcers and spread venereal diseases—anythingrather than confront that implacable enemy of whims: reality.And out of all those variants of Progressive education’s results, out of thatspectacle of human self-degradation, there rises a grim, factual, unanswerableproof of the place of reason in man’s nature and existence, as a silent warningto all the comprachicos and their allies: You can destroy men’s minds, but youwill not find a substitute—you can condition men to irrationality, but youcannot make them bear it—you can deprive men of reason, but you cannot make themlive with what is left. That proof and warning is: drugs.The most damning refutation of the theories of all the hippie-activist-Marcusianhordes is the drug-glazed eyes of their members. Men who have found the rightway of life do not seek to escape from awareness, to obliterate theirconsciousness and to drug themselves out of existence. Drug addiction is theconfession of an unbearable inner state.Drugs are not an escape from economic or political problems, they are not anescape from society, but from oneself. They are an escape from the unendurablestate of a living being whose consciousness has been crippled, deformed,mutilated, but not eliminated, so that its mangled remnants are screaming thathe cannot go on without it.The phenomenon of an entire generation turning to drugs is such an indictment oftoday’s culture—of its basic philosophy and its educational establishment—thatno further evidence is necessary and no lesser causal explanation is possible.If they had not been trained to believe that belonging to a pack is a moral andmetaphysical necessity, would high-school children risk the physical destructionof their brains in order to belong to a pot-smoking “in-group”?If they had not been trained to believe that reason is impotent, would collegestudents take “mind-expanding” drugs to seek some “higher” means of cognition?If they had not been trained to believe that reality is an illusion, would youngpersons take drugs to reach a “higher” reality that seems to obey their wishes,except that they are smashed on pavements in attempting to fly out of windows?If a trained pack of commentators, sharing the same beliefs, did not glamorizethe obscene epidemic of self-destruction—by means of such estimates as“idealistic,” “revolutionary,” “new life-style,” “new morality,” “drugculture”—would the young have any cover left to hide their own deep-downknowledge that drug addiction is nothing but a public confession of personalimpotence?It is the educational establishment that has created this national disaster. Itis philosophy that has created the educational establishment. The anti-rationalphilosophic trend of the past two hundred years has run its course and reachedits climax. To oppose it will require a philosophical revolution or, rather, arebirth of philosophy. Appeals to “home, church, mother and tradition” will notdo; they never did. Ideas can be fought only by means of ideas. The educationalestablishment has to be fought—from bottom to top, from cause to consequences,from nursery schools to universities, from basic philosophy to campus riots,from without and from within.This last is addressed to the many intelligent youths who are aware of the stateof higher education and refuse to go to college or, having gone, drop out inrevulsion. They are playing into the comprachicos’ hands. If the better mindsdesert the universities, this country will reach a situation in which theincompetent and the second-rate will carry the official badge of the intellectand there will be no place for the first-rate and independent to function oreven to hide. To preserve one’s mind intact through a modem college education isa test of courage and endurance, but the battle is worth it and the stakes arethe highest possible to man: the survival of reason. The time spent in collegeis not wasted, if one knows how to use the comprachicos against themselves: onelearns in reverse—by subjecting their theories to the most rigorously criticalexamination and discovering what is false and why, what is true, what are theanswers.As to the drugged contingents of hippies and activists, I should like to addressthe following to those among them who may still be redeemable, as well as tothose who may be tempted to join their hordes.The modern comprachicos have an advantage over their ancient predecessors: whena victim was mutilated physically, he retained the capacity to discover who haddone it. But when a victim is mutilated mentally, he clings to his owndestroyers as his masters and his only protectors against the horror of thestate which they have created; he remains as their tool and theirplay-thing—which is part of their racket.If, in the chaos of your motives, some element is a genuine desire to crusade ina righteous cause and take part in a heroic battle, direct it against the properenemy. Yes, the world is in a terrible state—but what caused it? Capitalism?Where do you see it, except for some battered remnants that still manage to keepus all alive? Yes, today’s “Establishment” is a rotted structure of mindlesshypocrisy—but who and what is the “Establishment”? Who directs it? Not the bigbusinessmen, who mouth the same collectivist slogans as your professors and pourout millions of dollars to support them. Not the so-called “conservatives,” whocompete with your professors in attacking reason and in spreading the samecollectivist-altruist-mystic notions. Not the Washington politicians, who arethe eager dummies of your professorial ventriloquists. Not the communicationsmedia, who publicize your cause, praise your ideals and preach your professors’doctrines.It is ideas that determine the actions of all those people, and it is theEducational Establishment that determines the ideas of a nation. It is yourprofessors’ ideas that have ruled the world for the past fifty years or longer,with a growing spread of devastation, not improvement—and today, in default ofopposition, these ideas are destroying the world, as they destroyed your mindand self-esteem.You are miserably helpless and want to rebel? Then rebel against the ideas ofyour teachers. You will never find a harder, nobler or more heroic form ofrebellion. You have nothing to lose but your anxiety. You have your mind to win.In conclusion, I should like to quote—for one of the guiltiest groups, theparents—a passage from Atlas Shrugged, which deals with Rearden’s thoughts afterthe death of the Wet Nurse:“He thought of all the living species that train their young in the art ofsurvival, the cats who teach their kittens to hunt, the birds who spend suchstrident effort on teaching their fledglings to fly—yet man, whose tool ofsurvival is the mind, does not merely fail to teach a child to think, butdevotes the child’s education to the purpose of destroying his brain, ofconvincing him that thought is futile and evil, before he has started tothink....“Men would shudder, he thought, if they saw a mother bird plucking the feathersfrom the wings of her young, then pushing him out of the nest to struggle forsurvival—yet that was what they did to their children.“Armed with nothing but meaningless phrases, this boy had been thrown to fightfor existence, he had hobbled and groped through a brief, doomed effort, he hadscreamed his indignant, bewildered protest—and had perished in his first attemptto soar on his mangled wings.” (August-December 1970)"},{"pageContent":"The Culture004 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_004_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Apollo and DionysusOn July 16, 1969, one million people, from all over the country, converged onCape Kennedy, Florida, to witness the launching of Apollo 11 that carriedastronauts to the moon.On August 15, 300,000 people, from all over the country, converged on Bethel,New York, near the town of Woodstock, to witness a rock music festival.These two events were news, not philosophical theory. These were facts of ouractual existence, the kinds of facts—according to both modern philosophers andpractical businessmen—that philosophy has nothing to do with.But if one cares to understand the meaning of these two events—to grasp theirroots and their consequences—one will understand the power of philosophy andlearn to recognize the specific forms in which philosophical abstractions appearin our actual existence.The issue in this case is the alleged dichotomy of reason versus emotion.This dichotomy has been presented in many variants in the history of philosophy,but its most colorfully eloquent statement was given by Friedrich Nietzsche. InThe Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music, Nietzsche claims that he observedtwo opposite elements in Greek tragedies, which he saw as metaphysicalprinciples inherent in the nature of reality; he named them after two Greekgods: Apollo, the god of light, and Dionysus, the god of wine. Apollo, inNietzsche’s metaphysics, is the symbol of beauty, order, wisdom, efficacy(though Nietzsche equivocates about this last)—i.e., the symbol of reason.Dionysus is the symbol of drunkenness or, rather, Nietzsche cites drunkenness ashis identification of what Dionysus stands for: wild, primeval feelings,orgiastic joy, the dark, the savage, the unintelligible element in man—i.e., thesymbol of emotion.Apollo, according to Nietzsche, is a necessary element, but an unreliable andthus inferior guide to existence, that gives man a superficial view of reality:the illusion of an orderly universe. Dionysus is the free, unfettered spiritthat offers man—by means of a mysterious intuition induced by wine and drugs—amore profound vision of a different kind of reality, and is thus the superior.And—indicating that Nietzsche knew clearly what he was talking about, eventhough he chose to express it in a safely, drunkenly Dionysian manner—Apollorepresents the principle of individuality, while Dionysus leads man “intocomplete self-forgetfulness” and into merging with the “Oneness” of nature.(Those who, at a superficial reading, take Nietzsche to be an advocate ofindividualism, please note.)This much is true: reason is the faculty of an individual, to be exercisedindividually; and it is only dark, irrational emotions, obliterating his mind,that can enable a man to melt, merge and dissolve into a mob or a tribe. We mayaccept Nietzsche’s symbols, but not his estimate of their respective values, northe metaphysical necessity of a reason-emotion dichotomy.It is not true that reason and emotion are irreconcilable antagonists or thatemotions are a wild, unknowable, ineffable element in men. But this is whatemotions become for those who do not care to know what they feel, and whoattempt to subordinate reason to their emotions. For every variant of suchattempts—as well as for their consequences—the image of Dionysus is anappropriate symbol.Symbolic figures are a valuable adjunct to philosophy: they help men tointegrate and bear in mind the essential meaning of complex issues. Apollo andDionysus represent the fundamental conflict of our age. And for those who mayregard them as floating abstractions, reality has offered two perfect,fiction-like dramatizations of these abstract symbols: at Cape Kennedy and atWoodstock. They were perfect in every respect demanded of serious fiction: theyconcretized the essentials of the two principles involved, in action, in a pure,extreme, isolated form. The fact that the spacecraft was called “Apollo” ismerely a coincidence, but a helpful coincidence.If you want to know fully what the conflict of reason versus irrational emotionmeans—in fact, in reality, on earth—keep these two events in mind: it meansApollo 11 versus the Woodstock festival. Remember also that you are asked tomake a choice between these two—and that the whole weight of today’s culture isbeing used to push you to the side of and into Woodstock’s mud.In my article “Apollo 11” (The Objectivist, September 1969), I discussed themeaning and the greatness of the moon landing. To quote: ”No one could doubtthat we had seen an achievement of man in his capacity as a rational being—anachievement of reason, of logic, of mathematics, of total dedication to theabsolutism of reality.... The most confirmed evader in the worldwide audiencecould not escape the fact that ... no feelings, wishes, urges, instincts orlucky ‘conditioning’ ... could have achieved this incomparable feat—that we werewatching the embodied concretization of a single faculty of man: hisrationality.”This was the meaning and motive of the overwhelming worldwide response to Apollo11, whether the cheering crowds knew it consciously or not—and most of them didnot. It was the response of people starved for the sight of an achievement, fora vision of man the hero.This was the motive that drew one million people to Cape Kennedy for thelaunching. Those people were not a stampeding herd nor a manipulated mob; theydid not wreck the Florida communities, they did not devastate the countryside,they did not throw themselves, like whining thugs, at the mercy of theirvictims; they did not create any victims. They came as responsible individualsable to project the reality of two or three days ahead and to provide for theirown needs. There were people of every age, creed, color, educational level andeconomic status. They lived and slept in tents or in their cars, some of themfor several days, in great discomfort and unbearable heat; they did it gamely,cheerfully, gaily; they projected a general feeling of confident goodwill, thebond of a common enthusiasm; they created a public spectacle of responsibleprivacy—and they departed as they had come, without benefit of press agents.The best account of the nature of that general feeling was given to me by anintelligent young woman of my acquaintance. She went to see the parade of theastronauts when they came to New York. For a few brief moments, she stood on astreet corner and waved to them as they went by. “It was so wonderful,” she toldme. “People didn’t want to leave after the parade had passed. They just stoodthere, talking about it—talking to strangers—smiling. It was so wonderful tofeel, for once, that people aren’t vicious, that one doesn’t have to suspectthem, that we have something good in common.”This is the essence of a genuine feeling of human brotherhood: the brotherhoodof values. This is the only authentic form of unity among men—and only valuescan achieve it.There was virtually no comment in the press on the meaning of the popularresponse to Apollo 11; the comments, for the most part, were superficial,perfunctory, mainly statistical. There was a brief flurry of nonsense about“unity”—as if it were some mysteriously causeless emotional primary—withsuggestions about directing this unity to such inspiring goals as the crusadesagainst poverty, air pollution, wilderness-desecration, even urbantransportation. Then the subject was dropped, and the Apollo 11 story wasdropped as of no further significance.One of the paradoxes of our age is the fact that the intellectuals, thepoliticians and all the sundry voices that choke, like asthma, the throat of ourcommunications media have never gasped and stuttered so loudly about theirdevotion to the public good and about the people’s will as the supreme criterionof value—and never have they been so grossly indifferent to the people. Thereason, obviously, is that collectivist slogans serve as a rationalization forthose who intend, not to follow the people, but to rule it. There is, however, adeeper reason: the most profound breach in this country is not between the richand the poor, but between the people and the intellectuals. In their view oflife, the American people are predominantly Apollonian; the “mainstream”intellectuals are Dionysian.This means: the people are reality-oriented, commonsenseoriented,technology-oriented (the intellectuals call this “materialistic” and“middle-class”); the intellectuals are emotion-oriented and seek, in panic, anescape from a reality they are unable to deal with, and from a technologicalcivilization that ignores their feelings.The flight of Apollo 11 brought this out into the open. With rare exceptions,the intellectuals resented its triumph. A two-page survey of their reactions,published by The New York Times on July 21, was an almost unanimous spread ofdenigrations and denunciations. (See my article “Apollo 11.”) What theydenounced was “technology”; what they resented was achievement and its source:reason. The same attitude—with rare exceptions—was displayed by the popularcommentators, who are not the makers, but the products and the weather vanes ofthe prevailing intellectual trends.Walter Cronkite of CBS was a notable exception. But Eric Sevareid of CBS wastypical of the trend. On July 15, the eve of the launching, he broadcast fromCape Kennedy a commentary that was reprinted in Variety (July 23, 1969). “InWashington and elsewhere,” he said, “the doubts concern future flights, theirnumber, their cost and their benefits, as if the success of Apollo 11 werealready assured. We are a people who hate failure. It’s un-American. It is afair guess that failure of Apollo 11 would not curtail future space programs butre-energize them.”Please consider these two sentences: “We are a people who hate failure. It’sun-American.” (In the context of the rest, this was not intended as acompliment, though it should have been; it was intended as sarcasm.) Who doesn’thate failure? Should one love it? Is there a nation on earth that doesn’t hateit? Surely, one would have to say that failure is un-British or un-French orun-Chinese. I can think of only one nation to whom this would not apply: failureis not un-Russian (in a sense which is deeper than politics).But what Mr. Sevareid had in mind was not failure. It was the Americandedication to success that he was deriding. It is true that no other nation as awhole is as successful as America, which is America’s greatest virtue. Butsuccess is never automatically immediate; passive resignation is not a typicalAmerican trait; Americans seldom give up. It is this precondition of success—the“try, try again” precept—that Mr. Sevareid was undercutting.He went on to say that if Apollo 11 succeeded, “the pressure to divert thesegreat sums of money to inner space, terra firma and inner man will steadilygrow.” He went on to discuss the views of men who believe “that this adventure,however majestic its drama, is only one more act of escape, that it is man onceagain running away from himself and his real needs, that we are approaching thebright side of the moon with the dark side of ourselves.... We know that thehuman brain will soon know more about the composition of the moon than it knowsabout the human brain ... [and] why human beings do what they do.”This last sentence is true, and one would think that the inescapable conclusionis that man should use his brain to study human nature by the same rationalmethods he has used so successfully to study inanimate matter. But not accordingto Mr. Sevareid ; he reached a different conclusion: “It is possible that thedivine spark in man will consume him in flames, that the big brain will proveour ultimate flaw, like the dinosaur’s big body, that the metal plaque Armstrongand Aldrin expect to place on the moon will become man’s epitaph.”On July 20, while Apollo 11 was approaching the moon, and the world was waitingbreathlessly, Mr. Sevareid found it appropriate to broadcast the followingremark: no matter how great this event, he said, nothing much has changed, “manstill puts his pants on, one leg at a time, he still argues with his wife,” etc.Well, each to his own hierarchy of values and of importance.On the same day, David Brinkley of NBC observed that since men can now see andhear everything directly on television, by sensory-perceptual means (as hestressed), commentators are no longer needed at all. This implies that perceivedevents will somehow provide men automatically with the appropriate conceptualconclusions. The truth is that the more men perceive, the more they need thehelp of commentators, but of commentators who are able to provide a conceptualanalysis.According to a fan letter I received from Canada, the U.S. TVCOMMENTARIES duringApollo 11’s flight were mild compared to those on Canadian television. “Welistened to an appalling panel of ‘experts’ disparage the project as a ‘meretechnological cleverness by a stupid, pretentious speck of dust in the cosmos.’... They were also very concerned about the ‘inflated American ego’ if thevoyage succeeded. One almost got the impression that they would be greatlyrelieved if the mission failed!”What is the actual motive behind this attitude—the unadmitted, subconsciousmotive? An intelligent American newsman, Harry Reasoner of CBS, named itinadvertently; I had the impression that he did not realize the importance ofhis own statement. Many voices, at the time, were declaring that the success ofApollo 11 would destroy the poetic-romantic glamor of the moon, its fascinatingmystery, its appeal to lovers and to human imagination. Harry Reasoner summed itup by saying simply, quietly, a little sadly, that if the moon is found to bemade of green cheese, it will be a blow to science; but if it isn’t, it will bea blow to “those of us whose life is not so well organized.”And this is the whole shabby secret: to some men, the sight of an achievement isa reproach, a reminder that their own lives are irrational and that there is noloophole, no escape from reason and reality. Their resentment is the corneredDionysian element baring its teeth.What Harry Reasoner’s statement implied was the fact that only the vanguard ofthe Dionysian cohorts is made up of wild, rampaging irrationalists, openlyproclaiming their hatred of reason, dripping wine and blood. The bulk ofDionysus’ strength, his grass-roots following, consists of sedate little soulswho never commit any major crime against reason, who merely indulge their pettyirrational whims once in a while, covertly—and. overtly, seek a “balance ofpower,” a compromise between whims and reality. But reason is an absolute: inorder to betray it, one does not have to dance naked in the streets with vineleaves in one’s hair; one betrays it merely by sneaking down the back stairs.Then, someday, one finds oneself unable to grasp why one feels no joy at thescientific discoveries that prolong human life or why the naked dancers areprancing all over one’s own body.Such are the Dionysian followers. But who are the leaders? These are not alwaysobvious or immediately identifiable. For instance, the greatest Dionysian inhistory was a shriveled little “square,” well past thirty, who never drank orsmoked pot, who took a daily walk with such precise, monotonous regularity thatthe townspeople set their clocks by him; his name was Immanuel Kant.Kant was the first hippie in history.But a generalissimo of that kind needs lieutenants and noncommissioned officers:Apollo cannot be defeated by buck privates who are merely the conditionedproducts of their officers. Nor can the buck privates unleash the Dionysianhordes on the world, out of the zoos, the coffeehouses and the colleges wherethey are bred. To do that job—and to blindfold the keepers—requires some men ofstature, but men with a split face who have worn an Apollonian half-mask on theside turned to the world, thus convincing the unwary that a “compromise” ispossible.This brings us to one of Kant’s noncommissioned officers (he is not the onlyone, but he is typical), a man who serves as a transmission belt to Dionysus andto Woodstock: Charles A. Lindbergh.Forty-two years ago, Lindbergh was a hero. His great feat—the solo flight acrossthe Atlantic—had required major virtues, including a significant degree ofrationality. As a grim demonstration of the nature of man’s volition—of the factthat neither rationality nor any other virtue is automatically permanent, butrequires a constant, volitional practice—I offer in evidence a letter fromLindbergh, commenting on Apollo 11’s coming flight, published in Life magazine,July 4, 1969. It demonstrates what is left of what had once been a hero.Mr. Lindbergh confesses that he does not know all the motives that prompted himto fly the Atlantic (which proves nothing but a failure of introspection). “ButI can say quite definitely that they sprang more from intuition than fromrationality, and that the love of flying outweighed practical purposes—importantas the latter often were.”Observe that the choice and love of one’s profession are here regarded as havingno connection with rationality or with practical purposes, whatever these mightbe.“Then, as the art of flying transposed to a science, I found my interest inairplanes decreasing. Rationally I welcomed the advances that came withself-starters, closed cockpits, radio and automatic pilots. Intuitively I feltrevolted by them, for they upset the balance between intellect and senses thathad made my profession such a joy.”A great deal could be identified, in this sort of statement, about the nature ofMr. Lindbergh’s “intuition” and about the motives he finds so mysterious. But Ishall let him speak for himself and let you draw your own conclusions.“And so, as intuition had led me into aviation in the first place, it led meback to an early boyhood interest, the contemplation of life.”He does not state by what means he intended to contemplate it, since he hadrejected reason.“I found the mechanics of life less interesting than the mystical qualities theymanifest. With these conclusions, I began studying supersensory phenomena and,in 1937, flew to India in the hope of gaining insight to yogic practices.”Some years later, he states, he made expeditions into the wildernesses ofAfrica, Eurasia and the American continents, which gave him a new perspective,“a perspective that drove into my bones, as well as into my mind, the fact thatin instinct rather than in intellect is manifest the cosmic plan of life.”When he attended the launching of Apollo 8, he was momentarily impressed.“Talking to astronauts and engineers, I felt an almost overwhelming desire toreenter the fields of astronautics—with their scientific committees,laboratories, factories and block-houses, possibly to voyage into space myself.But I know I will not return to them, despite limitless possibilities forinvention, exploration and adventure.“Why not? Decades spent in contact with science and its vehicles have directedmy mind and senses to areas beyond their reach. I now see scientificaccomplishment as a path, not an end; a path leading to and disappearing inmystery.”Observe the motive of placing one’s own motives outside the power of reason: itpermits one to regard an explanation of that kind as satisfactory, and anepistemological claim of that kind as requiring no further proof.From the incoherent paragraphs that follow, one can gather only that what Mr.Lindbergh holds against science is the fact that science does not give usomniscience and omnipotence. “Scientific knowledge argues that space vehiclescan never attain the speed of light, which makes a puny penetration of theuniverse within a human lifespan; and that, therefore, cosmic distances willconfine our physical explorations to those planets which orbit the sun ...scientifically established principles now seem to limit [man] to thespace-territory of the minor star he orbits. We are blocked by lack of time aswe were once blocked by lack of air.”But, he wonders, are we perhaps cracking open the entrance to another era, “onethat will surpass the era of science as the era of science surpassed that ofreligious superstition? Following the paths of science, we become constantlymore aware of mysteries beyond scientific reach. In these vaguely apprehendedazimuths, I think the great adventures of the future lie—in voyagesinconceivable by our 20th Century rationality—beyond the solar system, throughdistant galaxies, possibly through peripheries untouched by time and space.”If this does not make sense to you, the fault lies in your “20th Centuryrationality.” Mr. Lindbergh claims a different means of cognition. “We know thattens of thousands of years ago, man departed from both the hazards and thesecurity of instinct’s natural selection, and that his intellectual reactionshave become too powerful to permit him ever to return.... We must find a way toblend with our present erratic tyranny of mind the countless, subtle andstill-little-known elements that created the tangible shape of man and hisintangible extensions.”There follows an incoherent paean to “wildness”—not “nature,” but “wildness.” In“wildness”—as opposed to technological progress and civilization—Mr. Lindberghhas found “a direction ... an awareness of values ... and the means of oursalvation.”To help you untangle this, I can only quote Ellsworth Toohey in TheFountainhead: “Don’t bother to examine a folly—ask yourself only what itaccomplishes.” Mr. Lindbergh accomplishes the following:“If we can combine our knowledge of science with the wisdom of wildness, if wecan nurture civilization through roots in the primitive, man’s potentialitiesappear to be unbounded ... he can merge with the miraculous—to which we canattach what better name than ‘God’? And in this merging, as long sensed byintuition but still only vaguely perceived by rationality, experience may travelwithout need for accompanying life.“Will we then find life to be only a stage, though an essential one, in a cosmicevolution of which our evolving awareness is beginning to become aware? Will wediscover that only without spaceships can we reach the galaxies; that onlywithout cyclotrons can we know the interior of atoms? [Italics his.] To venturebeyond the fantastic accomplishments of this physically fantastic age, sensoryperception must combine with the extra-sensory, and I suspect that the two willprove to be different faces of each other.”What are the puny little compromises sought by today’s politicians, compared toa quest for a compromise of this kind?I have said, in Atlas Shrugged, that mysticism is anti-man, anti-mind,anti-life. I received violent protests from mystics, assuring me that this isnot true. Observe that Mr. Lindbergh regards life, spaceships and cyclotrons asequally dispensable, that he talks of “experience” which travels “without needfor accompanying life”—and that his intuition promises him achievements greaterthan those reached by the advocates of life, reason and civilization.Well, reality has obliged him. He does not have to wait for tens of thousands ofyears, for evolution, for a reunion with wildness, for intergalactic travel. Thegoal, the ideal, the salvation and the ecstasy have been achieved -by 300,000people wallowing in the mud on an excrement-strewn hillside near Woodstock.Their name for the experience of travel unaccompanied by life, to peripheriesuntouched by time and space, is “LSD trips.”The “Woodstock Music and Art Fair” did not take place in Woodstock; likeeverything else about that event, its title was a phony, an attempt to cash inon the artistic reputation of the Woodstock community. The fair took place on anempty thousand-acre pasture leased by the promoters from a local farmer. Inresponse to $200,000 worth of publicity and advertising, 300,000 hippies showedup for the occasion. (These figures are from The New York Times; some sourcesplace the attendance estimate higher.)According to Newsweek (August 25): “The three-day Woodstock fair was differentfrom the usual pop festival from the outset. It was not just a concert but atribal gathering, expressing all the ideas of the new generation: communalliving away from the cities, getting high, digging arts, clothes and craftexhibits, and listening to the songs of revolution.” The article quotes one ofthe promoters as declaring: “People will all be going into their own thing. Thisis not just music, but a conglomeration of everything involved in the newculture.”So it was.No living, eating or sanitary facilities were provided; the promoters claimedthat they had not expected so large a crowd. Newsweek describes the conditionsas follows: “Festival food supplies were almost immediately exhausted ... andwater coming from wells dug into the area stopped flowing or came up impure. Aheavy rain Friday night turned the amphitheater into a quagmire and theconcession area into a mudhole.... Throngs of wet, sick and wounded hippiestrekked to impromptu hospital tents suffering from colds, sore throats, brokenbones, barbed-wire cuts and nail-puncture wounds. Festival doctors called it a‘health emergency,’ and 50 additional doctors were flown in from New York Cityto meet the crisis.”According to The New York Times (August 18), when the rainstorm came “at least80,000 young people sat or stood in front of the stage and shouted obscenitiesat the darkened skies as trash rolled down the muddy hillside with the runoff ofthe rain. Others took shelter in dripping tents, lean-tos, cars and trucks....Many boys and girls wandered through the storm nude, red mud clinging to theirbodies.”Drugs were used, sold, shared or given away during the entire festival.Eyewitnesses claim that 99 percent of the crowd smoked marijuana; but heroin,hashish, LSD and other stronger drugs were peddled openly. The nightmareconvulsions of so-called “bad trips” were a common occurrence. One young mandied, apparently from an overdose of heroin.The Newsweek report concludes with: “The promoters had hired members of the HogFarm, a New Mexico hippie commune, to peacefully police the fair. At week’s endnear the Hog Farm campsite, a hard core of crazies barked like dogs and freakedout in a bizarre circle dance lit by flashing strobe lights. The songs seemed tosum up what the young Aquarians believed, despite all misadventures, thefestival was all about: ‘Now, now, now is all there is. Love is all there is.Love is. Love.’ ”Who paid for this love-feast? Apparently, the unloved ones: those who know thatthere is more than the “now” for a human being—and that without it, even the“now” is not possible.The citizens of Bethel, the nearest community, were the victims, abandoned bytheir law-enforcing agencies. These victims were neither bums nor millionaires;they were farmers and small businessmen, who worked hard to earn their living.Their stories, reported in The New York Times (August 20), sound like those ofthe survivors of a foreign invasion.Richard C. Joyner, the operator of the local post office and general store onRoute 17B, “said that the youngsters at the festival had virtually taken overhis property—camping on his lawn, making fires on his patio and using thebackyard as a latrine....“Clarence W. Townsend, who runs a 150-acre dairy farm ... was shaken by theordeal. ‘We had thousands of cars all over our fields,’ he said. ‘There werekids all over the place. They made a human cesspool of our property and drovethrough the cornfields. There’s not a fence left on the place. They just torethem up and used them for firewood.’ ...“ ‘My pond is a swamp [said Royden Gabriele, another farmer]. I’ve got no fencesand they used my field as a latrine. They picked corn and camped all over theplace. They just landed wherever they could.... We pulled 30 of them out of thehay mow smoking pot.... If they come back next year I don’t know what I’ll do,’Mr. Gabriele said. ‘If I can’t sell, I’ll just burn the place down.’ ”No love—or thought—was given to these victims by the unsanitary apostles of love(and someday the world will discover that without thought there can be no love).Furthermore, the universal loving was not extended by the promoters of thefestival even to one another. “In the aftermath of Woodstock,” writes The NewYork Times (September 9), “as the euphoria of the ‘three days of peace andmusic’ dies out, the tales of the problems, the bickering, the power strugglesand the diverse philosophies of the four young businessmen are coming out.”The promoters were four young men, all of them in their twenties ; one of them,the heir to a drugstore products fortune, pledged his fortune to cover thefestival’s losses. Inasmuch as the Woodstock hordes broke down theticket-selling procedure, and half the people got in without paying the $7admission, the fair was “a financial disaster,” according to the young heir whosaid (in an earlier story) that his debts might reach $2 million.Now the four promoters are splitting up and fighting over control of theWoodstock Ventures Corporation.One of them was described as “a hippie who keeps one foot in the financial worldat all times” and as a boy “who eschews shoes, shirts and barbers (but who likeschauffeured Cadillacs and overseas jet travel and plunges in the stock market)...” All of them, apparently, have connections with “several largeEstablishment-oriented corporations and Wall Street investment firms [who] areinterested in cashing in on the youth market ...”One of them stated openly: “Maybe the best way to define the UndergroundIndustrial Complex ... is materialistic people of the underground trying to makemoney off of a generation of underground kids who feel they aren’tmaterialistic.”The problems that plagued these promoters “before, during and after the festivalreflect the difficulties in merging the ideas of ‘making money off the kids’ andtrying to let the kids believe that a rock festival, for example, is, as [one ofthem] likes to put it, ‘a groovy meeting of the tribes, a part of therevolution.’ ”If this is disgusting, there is something more disgusting still: the psychologyof those hundreds of thousands of “underground kids”—who, in justice, deserve nobetter.Under the title “Woodstock: Like It Was,” The New York Times (August 25)published a lengthy interview with six young people who had attended thefestival. The interview gives only their first names; five boys: Steve, Lindsey,Bill, Jimmy and Dan; and one girl: Judy. Most of them were college students; theyoungest one was “a 16-year-old junior at one of the city’s better privateschools.... All were from comfortable middle-class backgrounds.”I shall quote some of this interview. It is a remarkable psychological document.“Q. Why did you want to go [to the festival]?“Lindsey. It was the music. I wanted to go because of the music. That was theonly reason.“Judy. They had the most fantastic line-up of stars that I’ve ever heard about,more than any place I’ve ever heard of, better than Newport.“Q. Did you have any idea where you’d sleep or what there would be to eat?“Judy. Well, we drove down in a caravan of two cars—there were four girls andtwo guys- -but we were supposed to meet 20 or 30 other people who were drivingdown from New Hampshire and they were supposed to bring a tent, but we never meteach other. We just scattered.“Q. What about food?“Judy. We brought a bag of carrots. And some soda.“Q. Did you expect to be able to buy more there?“Judy. We never really thought about it.”When they were asked what they felt at the scene, Judy answered : “I just had afeeling that, wow, there are so many of us, we really have power. I’d alwaysfelt like such a minority. But I thought, wow, we’re a majority—it felt likethat. I felt, here’s the answer to anyone who calls us deviates.“Q. Was that before you heard any music?“Judy. I never made it to the concert. I never heard any music at all.“Q. The whole weekend?“Judy. Yeh. The whole weekend.”Further: “All the participants stressed a sense of what they called ‘community.’...“Steve. Everyone came there to be together—not that everyone would cease to bean individual—but everyone came there to be able to express their life style....“Q. Was there a lot of sharing?“A voice. Everything was shared....“Bill. I was sitting in a group of people and it was hot and the sun was beatingdown. All of a sudden you’d have a box of Cocoa Puffs hit you in the side.They’d say, ‘Take a handful and pass it on.’ And like Saturday afternoon we weresitting there and this watermelon came by with three mouthfuls taken out of it.You were supposed to take a bite and pass it on. Because some guy three rowsover said, ‘Give those people some watermelon.’ ”Further: “All the panel participants carried some kind of drug to thefestival—mostly marijuana.... Not infrequently drugs were given away by youngpeople eager to share. What couldn’t be had free could be bought from dealersroaming freely through the crowd.... Most of the participants regarded the drugsas an essential part of the scene ...“Q. How much of the time were you people up there stoned [i.e., deeply drugged]?“Lindsey. About 102 percent....“Q. Could you have had the festival without the drugs?“Steve. I’m sure there were people there you would have had trouble with ifthere had not been drugs there.”One of the boys remarked that some of the older ones were using cocaine.“Q. The older ones? How old?“Judy. About 24 or 26.”When they were asked what they wanted to be in the future, they answered asfollows:“Jimmy. All my life I’ve had just about everything I want. And I have to havewhatever I want for the rest of my life, except from now on I have to begin tothink of how to provide it for myself. And I don’t want to work because I can’thave everything and do everything I want if I have to stay in the same placefrom 9 to 5.“Judy. I’m going to try everything at least once. I lived on a communal farm fora month on the Cape. And, well, I liked it and I really enjoyed staying thereand I’ve always wanted to go back and try this thing again, grow tomatoes andthings.“Q. Do you want a family?“Judy. One child. Just, you know, to procreate. But I don’t want a familybecause I don’t want to get into that much responsibility. I want to be able tomove. I want to be able to leave at any time. I don’t want that muchrestriction.”Further: “Q. Was sex an important part of the scene [at Woodstock] ?“Dan. It was just a part. I don’t know if it was an important part or not.“Steve. In any society of 500,000 people over the course of three days you’regoing to have sex—let’s face it.“Jimmy.... They were no more free or less free in Woodstock than they are anyother place.“Dan. There was some society to what people did. I mean, they waited untilnight.“Q. You mean there were certain standards of decorum?“Dan. I think there were, yes. People still have some reservations. Some. Not asmany.”Had enough?Has it ever occurred to you that it is not an accident, but the psychologicalmechanism of projection that has made people of this kind choose to call theiropponents “pigs”?These are the young people whom the press is hailing as a “new culture” and as amovement of great moral significance—the same press and the same intellectualswho dismissed or denounced Apollo 11 as “mere technology.”Of the publications I have read, Newsweek was the most fastidious in regard toWoodstock: it offered no praise. The New York Times started by denouncing thefestival in an editorial entitled “Nightmare in the Catskills” (August 18), butreversed itself the next day and published an editorial with a softened tone.Time magazine went whole hog: it published an essay under the title “The Messageof History’s Biggest Happening” (August 29). This included such statements as:“As the moment when the special culture of U.S. youth of the ’60s openlydisplayed its strength, appeal and power, it may well rank as one of thesignificant political and sociological events of the age.” And: “The spontaneouscommunity of youth that was created at Bethel was the stuff of which legends aremade ...”Life magazine straddled the fence. It published a special edition devoted to theWoodstock festival; the best skill that technology has created in the field ofcolor photography was used to fill that issue with beautiful pictures of scummyyoung savages. And only toward the end of the two laudatory articles did thewriter strike a note of alarm: “The great stoned rock show had worked acountermiracle, trading on the freedom to get stoned, transforming it into aforce that tamed the crowd and extracted its compliance. Not that anyone minded,of course—the freedom to get stoned was all the freedom they wanted.... In thecold acid light, the spoiled field took on the aspect of an Orwellianconcentration camp stocked with drugs and music and staffed with charmingpolice. The [loud]speaker’s coaxing voice only enriched the nightmare ... I fearit will grow groovier in memory, when the market in madness leads on to showswe’d rather not see.”I found one brief letter to the editor of The New York Times (September 3), as alone voice of cognitive and moral sanity. It said, in part: “Perhaps the mostpeculiar aspect of this event, if we are forced to regard the festival assymbolic, is the awful mindless conformity of external appearance and behavior,and the manifest desperation of this lonely herd of pilgrims doing what Dharmademands—the lack of personal will or spirit...”These publications demonstrate that the hippies are right in one respect: theculture of today’s Establishment is done for, it is rotted through andthrough—and rebelling against it is like rebelling against a dead horse.The hippies are wrong, however, when they fancy themselves to be rebels. Theyare the distilled essence of the Establishment’s culture, they are theembodiment of its soul, they are the personified ideal of generations ofcrypto-Dionysians now leaping into the open.Among the various types of today’s younger generation, the hippies are the mostdocile conformists. Unable to generate a thought of their own, they haveaccepted the philosophical beliefs of their elders as unchallengeable dogma—as,in earlier generations, the weakest among the young conformed to thefundamentalist view of the Bible.The hippies were taught by their parents, their neighbors, their tabloids andtheir college professors that faith, instinct and emotion are superior toreason—and they obeyed. They were taught that material concerns are evil, thatthe State or the Lord will provide, that the Lilies of the Field do not toil—andthey obeyed. They were taught that love, indiscriminate love, for one’sfellow-men is the highest virtue—and they obeyed. They were taught that themerging of one’s self with a herd, a tribe or a community is the noblest way formen to live—and they obeyed.There isn’t a single basic principle of the Establishment which they do notshare—there isn’t a belief which they have not accepted.When they discovered that this philosophy did not work—because, in fact, itcannot work—the hippies had neither the wit nor the courage to challenge it;they found, instead, an outlet for their impotent frustration by accusing theirelders of hypocrisy—as if hypocrisy were the only obstacle to the realization oftheir ideals. And—left blindly, helplessly lobotomized in the face of aninexplicable reality that is not amenable to their feelings—they have norecourse but to the shouting of obscenities at anything that frustrates theirwhims, at men or at a rainy sky, indiscriminately, with no concept of thedifference.It is typical of today’s culture that these exponents of seething, raginghostility are taken as advocates of love.Avowed anti-materialists whose only manifestation of rebellion and ofindividualism takes the material form of the clothes they choose to wear, are apretty ridiculous spectacle. Of any type of nonconformity, this is the easiestto practice, and the safest.But even in this issue, there is a special psychological component : observe thehippies’ choice of clothing. It is not intended to make them look attractive,but to make them look grotesque. It is not intended to evoke admiration, but toevoke mockery and pity. One does not make oneself look like a caricature unlessone intends one’s appearance to plead: Please don’t take me seriously.And there is a kind of malicious wink, a contemptuous sneer, in the publicvoices acclaiming the hippies as heroes.This is what I would call “the court-jester premise.” The jester at the court ofan absolute monarch was permitted to say anything and to insult anyone, even hismaster, because the jester had assumed the role of a fool, had abdicated anyclaim to personal dignity and was using self-abasement as his protection.The hippies are a desperate herd looking for a master, to be taken over byanyone; anyone who would tell them how to live, without demanding the effort ofthinking. Theirs is the mentality ready for a Führer.The hippies are the living demonstration of what it means to give up reason andto rely on one’s primeval “instincts,” “urges,” “intuitions”—and whims. Withsuch tools, they are unable to grasp even what is needed to satisfy theirwishes—for example, the wish to have a festival. Where would they be without thecharity of the local “squares” who fed them? Where would they be without thefifty doctors, rushed from New York to save their lives—without the automobilesthat brought them to the festival—without the soda pop and beer they substitutedfor water—without the helicopter that brought the entertainers—without all theachievements of the technological civilization they denounce? Left to their owndevices, they literally didn’t know enough to come in out of the rain.Their hysterical incantations of worship of the “now” were sincere : theimmediate moment is all that exists for the perceptual-level, concrete-bound,animal-like mentality; to grasp “tomorrow” is an enormous abstraction, anintellectual feat open only to the conceptual (i.e., the rational) level ofconsciousness.Hence their state of stagnant, resigned passivity: if no one comes to help them,they will sit in the mud. If a box of Cocoa Puffs hits them in the side, they’lleat it; if a communally chewed watermelon comes by, they’ll chew it; if amarijuana cigarette is stuck into their mouth, they’ll smoke it. If not, not.How can one act, when the next day or hour is an impenetrable black hole inone’s mind?And how can one desire or feel? The obvious truth is that these Dionysiandesire-worshipers do not really desire anything. The little parasite whodeclared: “I have to have whatever I want for the rest of my life,” did not knowwhat he wanted; observe the “whatever” in his statement. Neither did the girlwho announced that she would “try everything at least once.” All of them arelooking desperately for somebody who will provide them with something they willbe able to enjoy or to desire. Desires, too, are a product of the conceptualfaculty.But there is one emotion which the hippies do experience intensely : chronicfear. If you have seen any of them on television, you have seen it leaping atyou from the screen. Fear is their brand, their hallmark; fear is the specialvibration by which they claim to recognize one another.I have mentioned the nature of the bond uniting the admirers of Apollo 11: thebrotherhood of values. The hippies, too, have a brotherhood, but of a differentkind: it is the brotherhood of fear.It is fear that drives them to seek the warmth, the protection, the “safety” ofa herd. When they speak of merging their selves into a “greater whole,” it istheir fear that they hope to drown in the undemanding waves of unfastidioushuman bodies. And what they hope to fish out of that pool is the momentaryillusion of an unearned personal significance.But all discussions or arguments about the hippies are almost superfluous in theface of one overwhelming fact: most of the hippies are drug addicts.Is there any doubt that drug addiction is an escape from an unbearable innerstate, from a reality one cannot deal with, from an atrophying mind one cannever fully destroy? If Apollonian reason were unnatural to man, and Dionysian“intuition” brought him closer to nature and truth, the apostles ofirrationality would not have to resort to drugs. Happy, self-confident men donot seek to get “stoned.”Drug addiction is the attempt to obliterate one’s consciousness, the quest for adeliberately induced insanity. As such, it is so obscene an evil that any doubtabout the moral character of its practitioners is itself an obscenity.Such is the nature of the conflict of Apollo versus Dionysus.You have all heard the old bromide to the effect that man has his eyes on thestars and his feet in the mud. It is usually taken to mean that man’s reason andhis physical senses are the element pulling him down to the mud, while hismystical, supra-rational emotions are the element that lifts him to the stars.This is the grimmest inversion of many in the course of mankind’s history. But,last summer, reality offered you a literal dramatization of the truth: it isman’s irrational emotions that bring him down to the mud; it is man’s reasonthat lifts him to the stars. (December 1969-January 1970)"},{"pageContent":"The “Inexplicable Personal Alchemy”The following news story by Henry Kamm appeared in The New York Times on October13, 1968, under the title “For Three Minutes I Felt Free.”MOSCOW—For three days last week, the “Prague spring” seemed to have come to onedingy street in Moscow. From morning into evening dissidents from the Soviet wayof life openly put their radical views to milling, informal groups, while policeblocked the streets to traffic.The disaffected intellectuals spoke not only under the eyes of the K.G.B.(secret police), but they knew that many of those with whom they debated wereeither regular members of the security apparatus or were doing part time servicefor it.If they had gathered for a similar protest at another time and place, they wouldhave been arrested as surely as were the five dissidents for whom they had cometo do vigil, in front of the courthouse on the dingy street.Inside, the five—Larisa Daniel, Pavel Litvinov, Vadim Delone, KonstantinBabitsky, Vladimir Dremlyuga—were standing trial for having, for a few minutesaround noon on Aug. 25 on Red Square, openly spoken their minds about theinvasion of Czechoslovakia.So did Natalya Gorbanevskaya, a poet, who was spared trial because she has twoyoung children, and Viktor Fainberg, an art critic, who lost four teeth duringthe arrest and consequently appeared to be not presentable even to the limitedpublic admitted to political trials. He was sent to a mental hospital instead.But for three of the defendants the Government revived the old Czarist penaltyfor radical political agitators exile. And the other two were sentenced toprison camps.Litvinov, a 30-year-old physicist whose grandfather was Maxim Litvinov, Stalin’sForeign Minister, was sentenced to five years of exile in a remote area ofRussia, as yet not announced. Mrs. Daniel, wife of Yuli Daniel, the imprisonedwriter, was banished for four years to a similar spot. Babitsky, 40-year-oldlanguage scholar, received three years in exile.Dremlyuga, 28, unemployed, was given the maximum jail term of three years.Delone, 23, a student and poet, got a two-and-a-half-year prison term and wasordered to serve four months of a previous suspended sentence.The ironic circumstance that only when some dissidents are standing trial forhaving sought to awaken the conscience of this politically inert nation canother dissidents gather publicly, and that their audience is only those ofproven immunity to radical thoughts, shows the hard limit to the infinitesimalscope of Soviet dissidence.The average citizen had no idea that five men and two women had denounced theircountry’s aggression and were being tried consequently on a charge ofobstructing pedestrian traffic on the empty vastness of Red Square.The only ones who knew were those who had been sent to the dingy street to poseas ordinary Communist youths or workers. Their mission was to observe andphotograph the few who, through an inexplicable personal alchemy, have thrownoff the leading conformity of the only society they have known and are condemnedto be its outcasts.But dissidents cannot change. As Larisa Daniel said outside another courthouse,during an earlier trial, “I cannot do otherwise.”They know that they are known only by those who hate them for raising theirvoices in protest and by those who love them because they are so few and drawtogether for company. Two of the principal figures in the streetdemonstrations—they have no leaders—only shrugged their shoulders when askedlast week whether any but their own small number was aware of what they weredoing.But Vladimir Dremlyuga, denounced in court as a provincial Don Juan, replied tothe judge who asked him Wednesday whether he thought what he had done on RedSquare was right, “Would I go to jail for something I think is not right?”The small band is becoming increasingly outspoken not because Soviet society hasbecome more tolerant of dissent. What one senses in talking with them is anincreasing sense of anguish that the small measure of liberty that appeared likea faint light at the end of the tunnel in the era of former Premier NikitaKhrushchev, earlier in the decade, is being snuffed out. Their courage is bornof despair.They are aware that among scientists particularly there may be chafing at therestrictiveness of life. But they say that most scientists are far removed frompolitical thought and the passion that alone can create freedom.They know that some poets enjoy a name for dissent outside this country, but ifthey really want to earn that name, why aren’t they here, the radicals ask.They are not politically naive, although a few have the other-worldly nobilityof thought and passion of Don Quixote. Both share the earthly and real passionof Vadim Delone, who, without bravado, told the judge before sentencing :“For three minutes on Red Square I felt free. I am glad to take your three yearsfor that.”a [rand_9781101137277_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-1]This news story is such a remarkable example of journalism at its best that Iwanted my readers to see it and to consider its wider implications.It is written by a reporter who knew how to observe essentials and whatquestions to raise. It is a simple, straightforward, factual account, but itsvery simplicity and its heartbreaking perceptiveness give it the qualities, notof a news story, but of a work of art: beauty, grandeur, a desperate honesty anda quietly unstressed cry for help—a cry addressed to no one in particular,carried between the lines from the frozen cobblestones of Moscow’s twilight tothe universe at large.In the many years since I left that country, this is the first news story aboutRussia that “got me.” It made me feel the kind of personal identification anddirectly immediate, personal pain that I have not felt about events in Russiafor a long time. It is an odd feeling: it is poignancy, wistfulness,helplessness and, above all, sadness—just pure, still sadness. The words in mymind, when I read that story, were: There, but for the grace of the UnitedStates of America, go I.I do not mean that I would have been one of the accused in that Sovietcourtroom: I knew enough, in my college days, to know that it was useless toattempt political protests in Soviet Russia. But that knowledge broke down,involuntarily, many times; so I would probably have been one of those protestersin the street who engaged in the terrible futility of debating with the secretpolice. I know how they felt and what would make them do it.There is a fundamental conviction which some people never acquire, some holdonly in their youth, and a few hold to the end of their days—the conviction thatideas matter. In one’s youth that conviction is experienced as a self-evidentabsolute, and one is unable fully to believe that there are people who do notshare it. That ideas matter means that knowledge matters, that truth matters,that one’s mind matters. And the radiance of that certainty, in the process ofgrowing up, is the best aspect of youth.Its consequence is the inability to believe in the power or the triumph of evil.No matter what corruption one observes in one’s immediate background, one isunable to accept it as normal, permanent or metaphysically right. One feels:“This injustice (or terror or falsehood or frustration or pain or agony) is theexception in life, not the rule.” One feels certain that somewhere on earth—evenif not anywhere in one’s surroundings or within one’s reach—a proper, human wayof life is possible to human beings, and justice matters. It takes years, ifever, to accept the notion that one lives among the not-fully-human; it isimpossible to accept that notion in one’s youth. And if justice matters, thenone fights for it: one speaks out—in the unnamed certainty that someone,somewhere will understand.It is not the particular content of a young person’s ideas that is of primaryimportance in this issue, but his attitude toward ideas as such. The best way todescribe it would be to say that he takes ideas seriously—except that “serious”is too unserious a word in this context: he takes ideas with the most profound,solemn and passionate earnestness. (Granted this attitude, his mind is alwaysopen to correct his ideas, if they are wrong or false; but nothing on earth cantake precedence for him over the truth of an idea.)This is the “inexplicable personal alchemy” that puzzled Henry Kamm: anindependent mind dedicated to the supremacy of ideas, i.e., of truth.Young persons who hold that conviction, do not have to “throw off the leadingconformity of the only society they have known.” They do not conform in thefirst place: they judge and evaluate; if they accept any part of the prevalentsocial trends, it is through intellectual agreement (which may be mistaken), notthrough conformity. They do not need to know different types of society in orderto discover the evils, falsehoods or contradictions of the one in which theylive: intellectual honesty is the only tool required.Men who possess this “personal alchemy” are exceedingly rare; they are a smallminority in any country or culture. In Soviet Russia, they are tragic martyrs.It is very likely that many of those young protesters were socialists or“idealistic communists”—like the doomed Czechoslovakian rebels whose subjugationthey were protesting. (This was not true in my case and time, I had never beenattracted to or fooled by any form of collectivism, but it is likely to be thecase of young people some forty years later.) It is likely that those youngprotesters took Soviet propaganda seriously: brought up on slogans extolling(undefined) freedom, justice, brotherhood and condemning military aggression,they were able to observe the absence of all those social values in Russia andto recognize the invasion of Czechoslovakia as the most brutal type of militaryaggression. Thus, if they took ideas seriously, they rebelled in the name of thevery ideas they had been taught.(This, incidentally, is the ultimate penalty of all dictators [and all liars]:their nemesis is those who believe them. A dictatorship has to promulgate somesort of distant goals and moral ideals in order to justify its rule and thepeople’s immolation; the extent to which it succeeds in convincing its victims,is the extent of its own danger; sooner or later, its contradictions are thrownin its face by the best of its subjects: the ablest, the most intelligent, themost honest. Thus a dictatorship is forced to destroy and to keep on destroyingthe best of its “human resources.” And be it fifty years or five centurieslater, ambitious thugs and lethargic drones are all a dictatorship will haveleft to exploit and rule; the rest will die young, physically or spiritually.)The dedication to ideas leads, in practice, to an almost involuntary goodwilltoward men—or rather to something deeper and more important, which is the rootof goodwill: respect. It leads to the attitude, in individual encounters, oftreating men as rational beings, on the unstated premise that a man is innocentuntil proved guilty, that he is not evil until he has proved himself to be;“evil,” in terms of this attitude, means closed to the power of ideas, i.e., ofreason.This is what would make the young dissenters debate political issues with theagents of the secret police. Wordlessly, the unnamed, unidentified feeling“These are human beings” would take precedence over the knowledge that these arehuman monsters. If named, the driving motive of the dissenters would be anappeal which, to them, is irresistible: “But don’t you see? It’s true!”—and theywould speak, regardless of circumstances, regardless of danger, regardless oftheir audience, so long as the audience had a human form, they would speak indesperate innocence, knowing that a life-or-death imperative compels them tospeak, not knowing fully why.And, facing a firing squad, if necessary, they would still feel it, with no timeto learn why and to discover that they are moved by the noblest form ofmetaphysical self-preservation: the refusal to commit spiritual suicide byabnegating one’s own mind and to survive as a lobotomized automaton.While her husband was being tried and sentenced to a prison camp, Larisa Danielsaid, supporting him: “I cannot do otherwise.” As a human being, she could not.Replying to a judge “who asked him whether he thought what he had done on RedSquare was right,” Vladimir Dremlyuga said: “Would I go to jail for something Ithink is not right?” Observe that this is an appeal to reason, an answer thatsprings spontaneously from the implicit premise that the “right” matters, that alogically and morally incontrovertible answer would matter to a judge who is ahuman being. I doubt that, at the age of 28, Dremlyuga would be able to conceiveof the psychological depravity he was dealing with—of the fact that the verypurity and rightness of his answer would evoke in the judge’s mind, not a senseof justice, but a response of guilty, vindictive hatred.Now consider the words of Vadim Delone when he said quietly (“without bravado”)to a judge about to sentence him to three years in prison: “For three minutes onRed Square I felt free. I am glad to take your three years for that.”This, I submit, is one of the noblest and most revealing statements everrecorded. It is revealing psycho-epistemologically, as an indication of the kindof soul that would make it.Delone seemed to be aware of the nature of his judges and of the social systemthey represented. Whom, then, was he addressing?Observe, in this connection, that these young dissenters had “sought to awakenthe conscience of this politically inert nation” —a nation resigned to slavery,indifferent to good or evil—yet they were not “politically naive” and two oftheir supporters in the street demonstrations “only shrugged their shoulderswhen asked ... whether any but their own small number was aware of what theywere doing.”Consciously or not, in the mind of any rebel in Soviet Russia, particularly ofthe young, there is only one court of final appeal against the injustice, thebrutality, the sadistic horror of the inhuman social system in which they aretrapped: abroad.The meaning of that word for a Soviet citizen is incommunicable to anyone whohas not lived in that country: if you project what you would feel for acombination of Atlantis, the Promised Land and the most glorious civilization onanother planet, as imagined by a benevolent kind of science fiction, you willhave a pale approximation. “Abroad,” to a Soviet Russian, is as distant, shiningand unattainable as these; yet to any Russian who lifts his head for a momentfrom the Soviet muck, the concept “abroad” is a psychological necessity, alifeline and soul preserver.That concept is made of brilliant bits sneaked, smuggled or floating in throughthe dense gray fog of the country’s physical and spiritual barbed-wire walls: inforeign movies, magazines, radio broadcasts, or even the clothing and theconfident posture of foreign visitors. These bits are so un-Soviet and so alivethat they blend in one’s mind into a vision of freedom, abundance, unimaginabletechnological efficacy, inconceivable achievements and, above all, a sense ofjoyous, fearless, benevolent gaiety. And if European countries, in this vision,are shining planets, America is the sun.It is not that one hopes for material help or liberation to come from “abroad”;it is that such a place exists. The mere knowledge that a nobler way of life ispossible somewhere, redeems the human race in one’s mind. And when, in momentsof despair or final extremity, one cries out in protest, that cry is notconsciously addressed to anyone, only to whatever justice might exist in theuniverse at large; but, subconsciously, the universe at large is “abroad.”And what is “abroad,” in fact? What is America today?According to the dominant voices of her press, America, too, has a vanguard ofyoung rebels, dissenters and fighters for freedom. Marching down the aisle of atheater, they shout their protest to the world: “I cannot travel without apassport! ... I am not allowed to smoke marijuana! ... I am not allowed to takemy clothes off!” (The New York Times, October 15, 1968.)These self-made puppets in search of a master, dangling and jerking hystericallyat the end of strings no one wants to pick up, begging and demanding to be takencare of—these exhibitionists who have nothing to exhibit, who combine themethods of a thug with the candied platitudes of a small-town evangelist, whose“creative self-expression” is as stale as their unwashed bodies, with drugseating away their brains, obscenities as the (appropriate) voice of their souls,and an all-consuming hatred as their only visible emotion—are the embodiedsymbols and protégés of the Establishment they are going through the motions ofdefying. There is a level of cowardice lower than that of a conformist: the“fashionable non-conformist.”Akin, in spirit, to any other product of decomposition, these are the productsof a decadent culture, who crawl out of the wreckage left on college campuses bygenerations practicing the cult of irrationality. With one eye on the gallery oftheir applauding teachers, they rebel against the “System” of their groggyelders in the name of such controversial issues as “Love” and “Poverty,” theydemand the freedom to batter down doors and chase speakers away from universitylecterns, the freedom to burn the manuscripts of professors, the freedom to bashin the skulls of their opponents—and, openly proclaiming their intention tokill, they win the apologies of judges, college presidents and newspapereditors, who call them “youthful idealists,” they are tailed by televisioncrews, they fight on the barricades of coffeehouses and discotheques, they laysiege to Hollywood and storm the Bastille of the jet set’s cocktail parties.While, under dictatorships, young men are giving their lives for the freedom ofthe mind, it is against the mind—against the “tyranny” of reason andreality—that young thugs are rebelling in America. It is the mind—the power ofideas—that Western culture is now rigged to destroy, offering the power of dope,guns and gangs as a substitute.There is a level of intellectual corruption lower than that of adolescenthoodlums: their aging, sanctimonious apologists who gush that the hoodlums aremoved by compassion. “Compassion?” “Justice?” “Brotherhood?” “Concern forsuffering?” “The liberation of the oppressed?” If any of these were their actualmotives, where were those crusaders in October of last year? Why aren’t theystaging a demonstration in front of the Soviet Embassy ?If anyone wonders at the moral credibility gap of today—at the heavy, graydullness of our cultural atmosphere, with its sickening mixture of boredom andblood, at the lethargic cynicism, the skeptical indifference, the morallimpness, and the contempt of the country at large for all those prostitutedslogans (as well as its desperately blind quest and need of morality)—this GrandGuignol of altruism is the reason.Who can take any values seriously if he is offered, for moral inspiration, achoice between two images of youth: an unshaved, barefooted Harvard graduate,throwing bottles and bombs at policemen—or a prim, sun-helmeted, frustratedlittle autocrat of the Peace Corps, spoon-feeding babies in a jungle clinic?No, these are not representative of America’s youth—they are, in fact, a verysmall minority with a very loud group of unpaid p.r. [agents] on universityfaculties and among the press—but where are its representatives? Where areAmerica’s young fighters for ideas, the rebels against conformity to thegutter—the young men of “inexplicable personal alchemy,” the independent mindsdedicated to the supremacy of truth?With very rare exceptions, they are perishing in silence, unknown and unnoticed.Consciously or subconsciously, philosophically and psychologically, it isagainst them that the cult of irrationality—i.e., our entire academic andcultural Establishment—is directed.They perish gradually, giving up, extinguishing their minds before they have achance to grasp the nature of the evil they are facing. In lonely agony, they gofrom confident eagerness to bewilderment to indignation to resignation—toobscurity. And while their elders putter about, conserving redwood forests andbuilding sanctuaries for mallard ducks, nobody notices those youths as they dropout of sight one by one, like sparks vanishing in limitless black space; nobodybuilds sanctuaries for the best of the human species.So will the young Russian rebels perish spiritually—if they survive their jailterms physically. How long can a man preserve his sacred fire if he knows thatjail is the reward for loyalty to reason? No longer than he can preserve it ifhe is taught that that loyalty is irrelevant—as he is taught both in the Eastand in the West. There are exceptions who will hold out, no matter what thecircumstances. But these are exceptions that mankind has no right to expect.When I read that news story about the Russian rebels, I thought of what I wouldhave felt, in my youth and in their place: if I knew that someone had escapedfrom the Soviet hell, it is him (or her) that I would have expected to speak forme. Today, since I did escape and have acquired a public voice, I felt that Ihad to speak for them—in the name of justice—even if few will hear me in theempty vastness of a decadent culture.I do not know what effect my one voice can have in a matter of this kind. But Iam addressing myself to the best within any man, Objectivist or not, who haspreserved some sense of humanity, justice and compassion, and is still able tocare and to give a damn.There is only one form of protest open to the men of goodwill in the semi-freeworld: do not sanction the Soviet jailers of those young people—do not help themto pretend that they are the morally acceptable leaders of a civilized country.Do not patronize or support the evil pretense of the so-called “culturalexchanges” —any Soviet-government-sponsored scientists, professors, writers,artists, musicians, dancers (who are either vicious bootlickers or doomed,tortured victims). Do not patronize, support or deal with any Soviet supportersand apologists in this country: they are the guiltiest men of all. Speak out onany scale open to you, public or private, in protest and in defense of thoseyoung victims.In a somewhat inadequate editorial (October 13, 1968), The New York Times saidthat the sentences of the young rebels “could have been—and probably would havebeen—much harsher had there not been such widespread admiration for these Sovietopponents of Soviet aggression, and so much world concern about their fate.”If the protest of the men of goodwill were wide enough and sustained enough, itmight possibly save the condemned.And one can never tell in what way or form some feedback from such a protestmight reach the lonely children in Red Square. (January 1969)"},{"pageContent":"The Age of EnvyA culture, like an individual, has a sense of life or, rather, the equivalent ofa sense of life—an emotional atmosphere created by its dominant philosophy, byits view of man and of existence. This emotional atmosphere represents aculture’s dominant values and serves as the leitmotif of a given age, settingits trends and its style.Thus Western civilization had an Age of Reason and an Age of Enlightenment. Inthose periods, the quest for reason and enlightenment was the dominantintellectual drive and created a corresponding emotional atmosphere thatfostered these values.Today, we live in the Age of Envy.“Envy” is not the emotion I have in mind, but it is the clearest manifestationof an emotion that has remained nameless; it is the only element of a complexemotional sum that men have permitted themselves to identify.Envy is regarded by most people as a petty, superficial emotion and, therefore,it serves as a semihuman cover for so inhuman an emotion that those who feel itseldom dare admit it even to themselves. Mankind has lived with it, has observedits manifestations and, to various extents, has been ravaged by it for countlesscenturies, yet has failed to grasp its meaning and to rebel against itsexponents.Today, that emotion is the leitmotif, the sense of life of our culture. It isall around us, we are drowning in it, it is almost explicitly confessed by itsmore brazen exponents—yet men continue to evade its existence and are peculiarlyafraid to name it, as primitive people were once afraid to pronounce the name ofthe devil.That emotion is: hatred of the good for being the good.This hatred is not resentment against some prescribed view of the good withwhich one does not agree. For instance, if a child resents some conventionaltype of obedient boy who is constantly held up to him as an ideal to emulate,this is not hatred of the good: the child does not regard that boy as good, andhis resentment is the product of a clash between his values and those of hiselders (though he is too young to grasp the issue in such terms). Similarly, ifan adult does not regard altruism as good and resents the adulation bestowedupon some “humanitarian,” this is a clash between his values and those ofothers, not hatred of the good.Hatred of the good for being the good means hatred of that which one regards asgood by one’s own (conscious or subconscious) judgment. It means hatred of aperson for possessing a value or virtue one regards as desirable.If a child wants to get good grades in school, but is unable or unwilling toachieve them and begins to hate the children who do, that is hatred of the good.If a man regards intelligence as a value, but is troubled by self-doubt andbegins to hate the men he judges to be intelligent, that is hatred of the good.The nature of the particular values a man chooses to hold is not the primaryfactor in this issue (although irrational values may contribute a great deal tothe formation of that emotion). The primary factor and distinguishingcharacteristic is an emotional mechanism set in reverse: a response of hatred,not toward human vices, but toward human virtues.To be exact, the emotional mechanism is not set in reverse, but is set one way:its exponents do not experience love for evil men; their emotional range islimited to hatred or indifference. It is impossible to experience love, which isa response to values, when one’s automatized response to values is hatred.In any specific instance, this type of hatred is heavily enmeshed inrationalizations. The most common one is: “I don’t hate him for hisintelligence, but for his conceit!” More often than not, if one asks the speakerto name the evidence of the victim’s conceit, he exhausts such generalities as:“He’s insolent ... he’s stubborn ... he’s selfish,” and ends up with someindeterminate accusation which amounts to: “He’s intelligent and he knows it.”Well, why shouldn’t he know it? Blank out. Should he hide it? Blank out. Fromwhom should he hide it? The implicit, but never stated, answer is: “From peoplelike me.”Yet such haters accept and even seem to admire the spectacle of conceit put onfor their benefit by a man who shows off, boasting about his own alleged virtuesor achievements, blatantly confessing a lack of self-confidence. This, ofcourse, is a clue to the nature of the hatred. The haters seem unable todifferentiate conceptually between “conceit” and a deserved pride, yet they seemto know the difference “instinctively,” i.e., by means of their automatizedsense of life.Since very few men have fully consistent characters, it is often hard to tell,in a specific instance, whether a given man is hated for his virtues or for hisactual flaws. In regard to one’s own feelings, only a rigorously conscientioushabit of introspection can enable one to be certain of the nature and causes ofone’s emotional responses. But introspection is the mental process most fiercelyavoided by the haters, which permits them a virtually unlimited choice ofrationalizations. In regard to judging the emotional responses of others, it isextremely difficult to tell their reasons in a specific case, particularly if itinvolves complex personal relationships. It is, therefore, in the broad,impersonal field of responses to strangers, to casual acquaintances, to publicfigures or to events that have no direct bearing on the haters’ own lives thatone can observe the hatred of the good in a pure, unmistakable form.Its clearest manifestation is the attitude of a person who characteristicallyresents someone’s success, happiness, achievement or good fortune—andexperiences pleasure at someone’s failure, unhappiness or misfortune. This ispure, “nonvenal” hatred of the good for being the good: the hater has nothing tolose or gain in such instances, no practical value at stake, no existentialmotive, no knowledge except the fact that a human being has succeeded or failed.The expressions of this response are brief, casual, as a rule involuntary. Butif you have seen it, you have seen the naked face of evil.Do not confuse this response with that of a person who resents someone’sunearned success, or feels pleased by someone’s deserved failure. Theseresponses are caused by a sense of justice, which is an entirely differentphenomenon, and its emotional manifestations are different: in such cases, aperson expresses indignation, not hatred—or relief, not malicious gloating.Superficially, the motive of those who hate the good is taken to be envy. Adictionary definition of envy is: “l. a sense of discontent or jealousy withregard to another’s advantages, success, possessions, etc. 2. desire for anadvantage possessed by another.” (The Random House Dictionary, 1968.) The samedictionary adds the following elucidation: “To envy is to feel resentful becausesomeone else possesses or has achieved what one wishes oneself to possess or tohave achieved.”This covers a great many emotional responses, which come from different motives.In a certain sense, the second definition is the opposite of the first, and themore innocent of the two.For example, if a poor man experiences a moment’s envy of another man’s wealth,the feeling may mean nothing more than a momentary concretization of his desirefor wealth; the feeling is not directed against that particular rich person andis concerned with the wealth, not the person. The feeling, in effect, may amountto: “I wish I had an income (or a house, or a car, or an overcoat) like his.”The result of this feeling may be an added incentive for the man to improve hisfinancial condition.The feeling is less innocent, if it involves personal resentment and amounts to:“I want to put on a front, like this man.” The result is a second-hander wholives beyond his means, struggling to “keep up with the Joneses.”The feeling is still less innocent, if it amounts to: “I want this man’s car (orovercoat, or diamond shirt studs, or industrial establishment).” The result is acriminal.But these are still human beings, in various stages of immorality, compared tothe inhuman object whose feeling is: “I hate this man because he is wealthy andI am not.”Envy is part of this creature’s feeling, but only the superficial,semirespectable part; it is like the tip of an iceberg showing nothing worsethan ice, but with the submerged part consisting of a compost of rotting livingmatter. The envy, in this case, is semirespectable because it seems to imply adesire for material possessions, which is a human being’s desire. But, deepdown, the creature has no such desire: it does not want to be rich, it wants thehuman being to be poor.This is particularly clear in the much more virulent cases of hatred, masked asenvy, for those who possess personal values or virtues: hatred for a man (or awoman) because he (or she) is beautiful or intelligent or successful or honestor happy. In these cases, the creature has no desire and makes no effort toimprove its appearance, to develop or to use its intelligence, to struggle forsuccess, to practice honesty, to be happy (nothing can make it happy). It knowsthat the disfigurement or the mental collapse or the failure or the immoralityor the misery of its victim would not endow it with his or her value. It doesnot desire the value: it desires the value destruction.“They do not want to own your fortune, they want you to lose it; they do notwant to succeed, they want you to fail; they do not want to live, they want youto die; they desire nothing, they hate existence ...” (Atlas Shrugged.)What endows such a creature with a quality of abysmal evil is the fact that ithas an awareness of values and is able to recognize them in people. If it weremerely amoral, it would be indifferent; it would be unable to distinguishvirtues from flaws. But it does distinguish them—and the essentialcharacteristic of its corruption is the fact that its mind’s recognition of avalue is transmitted to its emotional mechanism as hatred, not as love, desireor admiration.Consider the full meaning of this attitude. Values are that which one acts togain and/or keep. Values are a necessity of man’s survival, and wider: of anyliving organism’s survival. Life is a process of self-sustaining andself-generated action, and the successful pursuit of values is a precondition ofremaining alive. Since nature does not provide man with an automatic knowledgeof the code of values he requires, there are differences in the codes which menaccept and the goals they pursue. But consider the abstraction “value,” apartfrom the particular content of any given code, and ask yourself: What is thenature of a creature in which the sight of a value arouses hatred and the desireto destroy ? In the most profound sense of the term, such a creature is akiller, not a physical, but a metaphysical one—it is not an enemy of yourvalues, but of all values, it is an enemy of anything that enables men tosurvive, it is an enemy of life as such and of everything living.A community of values—of some sort of values—is a necessity of any successfulrelationship among living beings. If you were training an animal, you would nothurt it every time it obeyed you. If you were bringing up a child, you would notpunish him whenever he acted properly. What relationship can you have with thehating creatures, and what element do they introduce into social relationships?If you struggle for existence and find that your success brings you, notapproval and appreciation, but hatred, if you strive to be moral and find thatyour virtue brings you, not the love, but the hatred of your fellow-men, whatbecomes of your own benevolence? Will you be able to generate or to maintain afeeling of good will toward your fellow-men?The greatest danger in this issue is men’s inability—or worse:unwillingness—fully to identify it.Evil as the hating creatures are, there is something still more evil: those whotry to appease them.It is understandable that men might seek to hide their vices from the eyes ofpeople whose judgment they respect. But there are men who hide their virtuesfrom the eyes of monsters. There are men who apologize for their ownachievements, deride their own values, debase their own character—for the sakeof pleasing those they know to be stupid, corrupt, malicious, evil. Anobsequious pandering to the vanity of some alleged superior, such as a king, forthe sake of some practical advantage, is bad enough. But pandering to the vanityof one’s inferiors—inferior specifically in regard to the value involved—is soshameful an act of treason to one’s values that nothing can be left thereafterof the person who commits it, neither intellectually nor morally, and nothingever is.If men attempt to play up to those they admire, and fake virtues they do notpossess, it is futile, but understandable, if not justifiable. But to fakevices, weaknesses, flaws, disabilities? To shrink one’s soul and stature? Toplay down- or write down, or speak down, or think down?Observe just one social consequence of this policy: such appeasers do nothesitate to join some cause or other appealing for mercy; they never raise theirvoices in the name of justice.Cowardice is so ignoble an inner state that men struggle to overcome it, in theface of real dangers. The appeaser chooses a state of cowardice where no dangerexists. To live in fear is so unworthy a condition that men have died onbarricades, defying the tyranny of the mighty. The appeaser chooses to live inchronic fear of the impotent. Men have died in torture chambers, on the stake,in concentration camps, in front of firing squads, rather than renounce theirconvictions. The appeaser renounces his under the pressure of a frown on anyvacant face. Men have refused to sell their souls in exchange for fame, fortune,power, even their own lives. The appeaser does not sell his soul: he gives itaway for free, getting nothing in return.The appeaser’s usual rationalization is: “I don’t want to be disliked.” By whom?By people he dislikes, despises and condemns.Let me give you some examples. An intellectual who was recruiting members forMensa—an international society allegedly restricted to intelligent men, whichselects members on the dubious basis of I.Q. tests—was quoted in an interview asfollows: “Intelligence is not especially admired by people. Outside Mensa youhad to be very careful not to win an argument and lose a friend. Inside Mensa wecan be ourselves and that is a great relief.” (The New York Times, September 11,1966.) A friend, therefore, is more important than the truth. What kind offriend? The kind that resents you for being right.A professor, the head of a department in a large university, had a favoritegraduate student who wanted to be a teacher. The professor had tested him as aninstructor and regarded him as exceptionally intelligent. In a privateconversation with the young man’s parents, the professor praised him highly anddeclared: “There is only one danger in his future: he is such a good teacherthat the rest of the faculty will resent him.” When the young man got his Ph.D.,the professor did not offer him a job, even though he had the power to do so.The notion that an intelligent girl should hide her intelligence in order to bepopular with men and find a husband, is widespread and well-known. Of what valuewould such a husband be to her? Blank out.In an old movie dealing with college life, a boy asks a girl to help him getgood grades by means of an actually criminal scheme (it involves the theft of atest from the professor’s office). When she refuses, the boy asks scornfully:“Are you some sort of moralist?” “Oh, no, no,” she answers hastily andapologetically, “it’s just my small-town upbringing, I guess.”Do not confuse appeasement with tactfulness or generosity. Appeasement is notconsideration for the feelings of others, it is consideration for and compliancewith the unjust, irrational and evil feelings of others. It is a policy ofexempting the emotions of others from moral judgment, and of willingness tosacrifice innocent, virtuous victims to the evil malice of such emotions.Tactfulness is consideration extended only to rational feelings. A tactful mandoes not stress his success or happiness in the presence of those who havesuffered failure, loss or unhappiness; not because he suspects them of envy, butbecause he realizes that the contrast can revive and sharpen their pain. He doesnot stress his virtues in anyone’s presence: he takes for granted that they arerecognized. As a rule, a man of achievement does not flaunt his achievements,neither among equals nor inferiors nor superiors; he does not evaluatehimself—or others—by a comparative standard. His attitude is not: “I am betterthan you,” but: “I am good.”If, however, he encounters an envious hater who gets huffy, trying to ignore,deny or insult his achievements, he asserts them proudly. In answer to thehater’s stock question: “Who do you think you are?”—he tells him.It is the pretentious mediocrity—the show-off, the boaster, the snootyposturer—who seeks, not virtue or value, but superiority. A comparative standardis his only guide, which means that he has no standards and that he has a vestedinterest in reducing others to inferiority. Decent people, properly, resent ashow-off, but the haters and enviers do not: they recognize him as a soul mate.Offensive boasting or self-abasing appeasement is a false alternative. As in allhuman relationships, the guidelines of proper conduct are: objectivity andjustice. But this is not what men are taught or were taught in the past.“Use your head—but don’t let anyone know it. Set your goals high—but don’t admitit. Be honest—but don’t uphold it. Be successful—but hide it. Be great—but actsmall. Be happy—but God help you if you are!” Such are the moral injunctions wegather from the cultural atmosphere in which we grow up—as men did in the past,throughout history.The appeasement of evil—of an unknowable, undefinable, inexplicable evil—hasbeen the undertow of mankind’s cultural stream all through the ages. Inprimitive cultures (and even in ancient Greece) the appeasement took the form ofthe belief that the gods resent human happiness or success, because these arethe prerogatives of the gods to which men must not aspire. Hence thesuperstitious fear of acknowledging one’s good fortune—as, for instance, theritual of parents wailing that their newborn son is puny, ugly, worthless, forfear that a demon would harm him if they admitted their happy pride in hishealth and looks. Observe the contradiction: Why attempt to deceive anomnipotent demon who would be able to judge the infant’s value for himself? Theintention of the ritual, therefore, is not: “Don’t let him know that the infantis good,” but: “Don’t let him know that you know it and that you’re happy!”Men create gods—and demons—in their own likeness; mystic fantasies, as a rule,are invented to explain some phenomenon for which men find no explanation. Thenotion of gods who are so malicious that they wish men to live in chronicmisery, would not be conceived or believed unless men sensed all around them thepresence of some inexplicable malevolence directed specifically at theirpersonal happiness.Are the haters of the good that numerous? No. The actual haters are a small,depraved minority in any age or culture. The spread and perpetuation of thisevil are accomplished by those who profiteer on it.The profiteers are men with a vested interest in mankind’s psychologicaldevastation, who burrow their way into positions of moral-intellectualleadership. They provide the haters with unlimited means of rationalization,dissimulation, excuse and camouflage, including ways of passing vices off asvirtues. They slander, confuse and disarm the victims. Their vested interest ispower-lust. Their stock-in-trade is any system of thought or of belief aimed atkeeping men small.Observe the nature of some of mankind’s oldest legends.Why were the men of Babel punished? Because they attempted to build a tower tothe sky.Why did Phaëthon perish? Because he attempted to drive the chariot of the sun.Why was Icarus smashed? Because he attempted to fly.Why was Arachne transformed into a spider? Because she challenged a goddess to acompetition in the art of weaving—and won it.“Do not aspire—do not venture- -do not rise—ambition is self-destruction,”drones this ancient chorus through the ages—through all the ages, changing itslyrics, but not its tune—all the way to the Hollywood movies in which the boywho goes to seek a career in the big city becomes a wealthy, but miserablescoundrel, while the small-town boy who stays put wins the girl next door, whowins over the glamorous temptress.There is and was abundant evidence to show that the curse of an overwhelmingmajority of men is passivity, lethargy and fear, not ambition and audacity. Butmen’s well-being is not the motive of that chorus.Toward the end of World War II, newspapers reported the following : when Russiantroops moved west and occupied foreign towns, the Soviet authoritiesautomatically executed any person who had a bank account of $100 or ahigh-school education; the rest of the inhabitants submitted. This is a physicaldramatization of the spiritual policy of mankind’s moral-intellectual leaders:destroy the tops, the rest will give up and obey.Just as a political dictator needs specially indoctrinated thugs to enforce hisorders, so his intellectual road-pavers need them to maintain their power. Theirthugs are the haters of the good; the special indoctrination is the morality ofaltruism.It is obvious—historically, philosophically and psychologically—that altruism isan inexhaustible source of rationalizations for the most evil motives, the mostinhuman actions, the most loathsome emotions. It is not difficult to grasp themeaning of the tenet that the good is an object of sacrifice—and to understandwhat a blanket damnation of anything living is represented by an undefinedaccusation of “selfishness.”But here is a significant phenomenon to observe: the haters and enviers—who arethe most vociferous shock troops of altruism—seem to be subconsciouslyimpervious to the altruist criterion of the good. The touchy vanity of thesehaters—which flares up at any suggestion of their inferiority to a man ofvirtue—is not aroused by any saint or hero of altruism, whose moral superioritythey profess to acknowledge. Nobody envies Albert Schweitzer. Whom do they envy?The man of intelligence, of ability, of achievement, of independence.If anyone ever believed (or tried to believe) that the motive of altruism iscompassion, that its goal is the relief of human suffering and the eliminationof poverty, the state of today’s culture now deprives him of any foothold onself-deception. Today, altruism is running amuck, shedding its tatteredrationalizations and displaying its soul.Altruists are no longer concerned with material wealth, not even with its“redistribution,” only with its destruction—but even this is merely a means toan end. Their savage fury is aimed at the destruction of intelligence—ofability, ambition, thought, purpose, justice; the destruction of morality, anysort of morality; the destruction of values qua values.The last fig leaf of academic pretentiousness is the tag used to disguise thismovement: egalitarianism. It does not disguise, but reveals.Egalitarianism means the belief in the equality of all men. If the word“equality” is to be taken in any serious or rational sense, the crusade for thisbelief is dated by about a century or more: the United States of America hasmade it an anachronism—by establishing a system based on the principle ofindividual rights. “Equality,” in a human context, is a political term: it meansequality before the law, the equality of fundamental, inalienable rights whichevery man possesses by virtue of his birth as a human being, and which may notbe infringed or abrogated by man-made institutions, such as titles of nobilityor the division of men into castes established by law, with special privilegesgranted to some and denied to others. The rise of capitalism swept away allcastes, including the institutions of aristocracy and of slavery or serfdom.But this is not the meaning that the altruists ascribe to the word “equality.”They turn the word into an anti-concept: they use it to mean, not political, butmetaphysical equality—the equality of personal attributes and virtues,regardless of natural endowment or individual choice, performance and character.It is not man-made institutions, but nature, i.e., reality, that they propose tofight—by means of man-made institutions.Since nature does not endow all men with equal beauty or equal intelligence, andthe faculty of volition leads men to make different choices, the egalitarianspropose to abolish the “unfairness” of nature and of volition, and to establishuniversal equality in fact—in defiance of facts. Since the Law of Identity isimpervious to human manipulation, it.is the Law of Causality that they struggleto abrogate. Since personal attributes or virtues cannot be “redistributed,”they seek to deprive men of their consequences—of the rewards, the benefits, theachievements created by personal attributes and virtues.It is not equality before the law that they seek, but inequality: theestablishment of an inverted social pyramid, with a new aristocracy on top-—thearistocracy of non- value.Observe the nature of the various methods used to accomplish this goal.Since equal pay for unequal performance is too obvious an injustice, theegalitarians solve the problem by forbidding unequal performance. (See thepolicy of many labor unions.)Since some men are able to rise faster than others, the egalitarians forbid theconcept of “merit” and substitute the concept of “seniority” as the basis ofpromotions. (See the state of modern railroads.)Since the expropriation of wealth is a somewhat discredited policy, theegalitarians place limits on the use of wealth and keep shrinking them, thusmaking wealth inoperative. It is “unfair,” they cry, that only the rich canobtain the best medical care—or the best education—or the best housing—or anycommodity in short supply, which should be rationed, not competed for—etc., etc.(See any newspaper editorial.)Since some women are beautiful and others are not, the egalitarians are fightingto forbid beauty contests and television commercials using glamorous models.(See Women’s Lib.)Since some students are more intelligent and study more conscientiously thanothers, the egalitarians abolish the system of grades based on the objectivevalue of a student’s scholastic achievement, and substitute for it a system ofgrading “on a curve” based on a comparative standard: a set number of grades,ranging from A’s to failures, is given to each class, regardless of thestudents’ individual performances, with the “distribution” of grades calculatedon the relative basis of the collective performance of the class as a whole.Thus a student may get an A or an F for the same work, according to whether hehappens to be in a class of morons or of child prodigies. No better way could bedevised to endow a young man with a vested interest in the inferiority of othersand with fear and hatred of their superiority. (See the state of moderneducation.)Observe the fact that all these methods do not provide the inferiors with anypart of the virtues of their superiors, but merely frustrate and paralyze thevirtues. What, then, is the common denominator and basic premise of thesemethods? Hatred of the good for being the good.But most of these examples are merely the older and quieter manifestations of apremise which, once introduced into a culture, grows geometrically, pushing thehaters forward and creating new haters where none had existed before. Look attoday’s stampede.Pressure-group warfare is an inexorable result of a mixed economy and followsthe course of its philosophical progression: it starts with economic groups andleads to an explosion of anti-intellectual, anti-ideological gang warfare.Anything and everything may serve as a rallying point for a new pressure grouptoday, provided it is someone’s weakness.Weakness of any sort—intellectual, moral, financial or numerical—is today’sstandard of value, criterion of rights and claim to privileges. The demand foran institutionalized inequality is voiced openly and belligerently, and theright to a double standard is proclaimed self-righteously.Since numerical superiority has a certain value, at least in practical politics,the same collectivists who once upheld the vicious doctrine of unlimitedmajority rule, now deny to the majority—in any given issue- the specialprivileges they grant to any group that claims to be a minority.Racism is an evil and primitive form of collectivism. Today, racism is regardedas a crime if practiced by a majority—but as an inalienable right if practicedby a minority. The notion that one’s culture is superior to all others solelybecause it represents the traditions of one’s ancestors, is regarded aschauvinism if claimed by a majority—but as “ethnic” pride if claimed by aminority. Resistance to change and progress is regarded as reactionary ifdemonstrated by a majority—but retrogression to a Balkan village, to an Indiantepee or to the jungle is hailed if demonstrated by a minority.“Tolerance” and “understanding” are regarded as unilateral virtues. In relationto any given minority, we are told, it is the duty of all others, i.e., of themajority, to tolerate and understand the minority’s values and customs——whilethe minority proclaims that its soul is beyond the outsiders’ comprehension,that no common ties or bridges exist, that it does not propose to grasp onesyllable of the majority’s values, customs or culture, and will continue hurlingracist epithets (or worse) at the majority’s faces.Nobody can pretend any longer that the goal of such policies is the eliminationof racism—particularly when one observes that the real victims are the bettermembers of these privileged minorities. The self-respecting small home ownersand shop owners are the unprotected and undefended victims of every race riot.The minority’s members are expected by their egalitarian leaders to remain apassive herd crying for help (which is a precondition of the power to control apressure group). Those who ignore the threats and struggle to rise throughindividual effort and achievement are denounced as traitors. Traitors—to what?To a physiological (racial) collective—to the incompetence or unwillingness orlethargy or malingering of others. If the exceptional men are black, they areattacked as “Uncle Toms.” But the status of privileged minority is not confinedto the blacks, it extends to all racial minorities—on one condition—and some ofthe most offensive herds are white.That condition—the deeper issue involved, of greater importance to theegalitarians than mere numerical weakness—is the primitive nature of a givenminority’s traditions, i.e., its cultural weakness.It is primitive cultures that we are asked to study, to appreciate and torespect—any sort of culture except our own. A piece of pottery copied fromgeneration to generation is held up to us as an achievement—a plastic cup isnot. A bearskin is an achievement—synthetic fiber is not. An oxcart is anachievement—an airplane is not. A potion of herbs and snake oil is anachievement—open-heart surgery is not. Stonehenge is an achievement—the EmpireState Building is not. Black magic is an achievement—Aristotle’s Organon is not.And if there is a more repulsive spectacle than a television broadcastpresenting, as news, any two-bit group of pretentious, self-consciousadolescents, out of old vaudeville, performing some Slavonic folk dance on astreet corner, in the shadow of New York’s skyscrapers—I have not discovered ityet.Why is Western civilization admonished to admire primitive cultures? Becausethey are not admirable. Why is a primitive man exhorted to ignore Westernachievements? Because they are. Why is the self-expression of a retardedadolescent to be nurtured and acclaimed? Because he has nothing to express. Whyis the self-expression of a genius to be impeded and ignored? Because he has.“It is to the Mohammedans, the Buddhists, and the cannibals—to theunderdeveloped, the undeveloped, and the not-to-be-developed cultures—that theCapitalist United States of America is asked to apologize for her skyscrapers,her automobiles, her plumbing, and her smiling, confident, untortured,un-skinned-alive, un-eaten young men! ... It is not for her flaws that theUnited States of America is hated, but for her virtues—not for her weaknesses,but for her achievements—not for her failures, but for her success—hermagnificent, shining, life-giving success.” (“The Obliteration of Capitalism,”The Objectivist Newsletter, October 1965.)If there were such a thing as a passion for equality (not equality de jure, butde facto), it would be obvious to its exponents that there are only two ways toachieve it: either by raising all men to the mountaintop—or by razing themountains. The first method is impossible because it is the faculty of volitionthat determines a man’s stature and actions; but the nearest approach to it wasdemonstrated by the United States and capitalism, which protected the freedom,the rewards and the incentives for every individual’s achievement, each to theextent of his ability and ambition, thus raising the intellectual, moral andeconomic state of the whole society. The second method is impossible because, ifmankind were leveled down to the common denominator of its least competentmembers, it would not be able to survive (and its best would not choose tosurvive on such terms). Yet it is the second method that thealtruist-egalitarians are pursuing. The greater the evidence of their policy’sconsequences, i.e., the greater the spread of misery, of injustice, of viciousinequality throughout the world, the more frantic their pursuit—which is onedemonstration of the fact that there is no such thing as a benevolent passionfor equality and that the claim to it is only a rationalization to cover apassionate hatred of the good for being the good.To understand the meaning and motives of egalitarianism, project it into thefield of medicine. Suppose a doctor is called to help a man with a broken legand, instead of setting it, proceeds to break the legs of ten other men,explaining that this would make the patient feel better; when all these menbecome crippled for life, the doctor advocates the passage of a law compellingeveryone to walk on crutches—in order to make the cripples feel better andequalize the “unfairness” of nature.If this is unspeakable, how does it acquire an aura of morality—or even thebenefit of a moral doubt—when practiced in regard to man’s mind? Yet this kindof motivation—hatred of the healthy for being healthy, i.e., of the good forbeing the good—is the ruling spirit of today’s culture.Observe some random symptoms cracking open all around us, like the skin lesionsof a hidden disease.Egalitarian educators defeated a plan to establish a Montessori day-care centerfor disadvantaged children, because they “feared that the Montessori-traineddisadvantaged children would enter public kindergarten or the first grade withan advantage over the other children.” What was these educators’ motive: thedesire to lift the children of the poor—or to bring everyone down?A noted economist proposed the establishment of a tax on personal ability,suggesting that “a modest first step might be a special tax on persons with highacademic scores.” What would this do to the talented, purposeful young peoplewho are barely able to make a living while working their way through school?Would they be able to pay a tax for the privilege of using their intelligence ?Who—rich or poor—would want to use his intelligence in such conditions? Is itlove that would condemn the best of men to a lifetime of hiding theirintelligence as a guilty secret?Was compassion the motive of the noted social worker who, years ago, wrote abouther visit to Soviet Russia: “It was wonderful to see that everybody in thestreets was equally shabby”? Is compassion the motive of those who denounce theUnited States for the existence of slums in cities—yet keep silent about orsympathize with the Soviet system, which has turned an entire country into agigantic slum, with the exception of a small elite of rulers on top, and a vast,bloody sewer of forced labor camps below?Ask yourself what were the motives in the following example. A professor askedhis class which of two projected systems they would prefer: a system of unequalsalaries—or a system paying everyone the same salary, but which would be lowerthan the lowest one paid under the unequal system. With the exception of onestudent, the entire class voted for the system of equal salaries (which was alsothe professor’s preference).In politics, observe the sanctimonious smugness of any ward heeler who recitesthe ritualistic formula about defending the interests of “the poor, the blackand the young.” Why these? Because they are (presumably) weak. Who are the otherkinds of citizens and what about their interests? Blank out. The implication heconveys is not that the opposite kinds are “the rich, the white and the old”(the “hard-hats” are not rich, the “Uncle Toms” are black, and the old are theheroes of Medicare). The implication is that there is only one kind of opposite,regardless of age, sex, creed, color or economic status: the competent.At the turn of the century, when the notions of socialism were gainingadherents, it was believed that the competent should be enslaved in order toraise the rest of mankind to their level and equalize material benefits. Eventhough such a belief is evil, its adherents were better than today’segalitarians—as a man who kills for the sake of robbery is better than a man whokills for kicks. Today, socialism’s record has demonstrated the impracticalityof enslaving man’s mind—and has brought deeply buried motives out into the open.Today’s advocates of “equality” do not pretend that they wish to improve the lotof the poor; they do not wish to exploit the competent, but to destroy them.If anyone doubted the possibility of such motives, the ecological crusade shouldremove all doubts.When men’s greatest benefactor, technology, is denounced as an enemy ofmankind—when the U.S. is damned, not for the alleged exploitation of the masses,but explicitly for their material prosperity—when the villain is no longer theWall Street tycoon, but the American worker—when his crime is held to be hispay-check, and his greed consists in owning a television set—when the currentpejorative is not “the rich,” but “the middle class” (which means the best, themost competent, the most ambitious, the most productive group in any society,the group of self-made men)—when the plight of the poor is held to be, notpoverty, but relative poverty (i.e., envy)—when the great emancipator, theautomobile, is attacked as a public menace, and highways are decried as aviolation of the wilderness—when bleary-eyed, limp-limbed young hobos of bothsexes chant about the evil of labor-saving devices, and demand that human lifebe devoted to the grubby hand-planting of truck gardens, and to garbagedisposal—when alleged scientists stretch, fake or suppress scientific evidencein order to panic the ignorant about the interplanetary perils augured by somesuch omen as the presence of mercury in tuna fish—when their leading philosopherproclaims that work is an outdated prejudice, that fornication should replaceambition, and that mankind’s standard of living should be brought down—whensundry hordes block the construction of electric generators and are about toplunge New York City into the catastrophe of an overloaded power system’sfailure—it is time to grasp that we are not dealing with man-lovers, but withkillers.A cultural movement often produces caricatures of itself that emphasize itsessence. The hippies are one such caricature. These ecological crusaders—whowould pollute any stream by stepping into it—are the physical embodiments of thespirit of today’s culture. Much more can be said about their motives, but forthe moment observe the intention of the physical appearance they choose toassume. The purpose of flaunting deliberate ugliness and bodily dirt is tooffend others (while simultaneously playing for pity)—to defy, to affront, tobait those who hold values, any values.But the hippies were not enough. They were surpassed by the caricature to endall caricatures: Women’s Lib.Just as the egalitarians ride on the historical prestige of those who fought forpolitical equality, and struggle to achieve the opposite—so their specialsorority, Women’s Lib, rides on the historical prestige of women who fought forindividual rights against government power, and struggles to get specialprivileges by means of government power.Screaming that it is out to fight prejudice against women, this movement isproviding evidence on a grand public scale—on any street corner and televisionscreen—to support the worst prejudices of the bitterest misogynist.As a group, American women are the most privileged females on earth: theycontrol the wealth of the United States—through inheritance from fathers andhusbands who work themselves into an early grave, struggling to provide everycomfort and luxury for the bridge-playing, cocktail-party-chasing cohorts, whogive them very little in return. Women’s Lib proclaims that they should givestill less, and exhorts its members to refuse to cook their husbands’ meals—withits placards commanding: “Starve a rat today!” (Where would the cat’s food comefrom, after the rat is starved? Blank out.)The notion that a woman’s place is in the home—the Kinder-Küche-Kirche axis—isan ancient, primitive evil, supported and perpetuated by women as much as, ormore than, by men. The aggressive, embittered, self-righteous and envioushousewife is the greatest enemy of the career woman. Women’s Lib pounces uponthis aggressiveness, bitterness, self-righteousness, envy—and directs it towardmen. (It gives the lie, however, to one masculine prejudice: women are thoughtto be catty, but no cat and very few men could experience the degree ofmalicious hostility that these women are now displaying.)There is no place on earth where so many opportunities are open to career womenas in the United States, or where so many women have achieved successfulcareers. Women’s Lib proclaims that success should not have to be achieved, butshould be guaranteed as a right. Women, it claims, should be pushed by law intoany job, club, saloon or executive position they choose—and let the employerprove in court that he failed to promote a woman because she is a slob and notbecause she is a woman.There are men who fear and resent intelligent, ambitious women. Women’s Libproposes to eliminate such feelings by asserting that intelligence and abilitydo not matter, only gender does.Some men believe that women are irrational, illogical, incompetent,emotion-driven and unreliable. Women’s Lib sets out to disprove it by thespectacle of sloppy, bedraggled, unfocused females stomping down the streets andchanting brief slogans, over and over again, with the stuporous monotony of ajungle ritual and the sulkiness of a badly spoiled child.Denouncing masculine oppression, Women’s Lib screams protests against the policyof regarding women as “sex objects”—through speakers who, too obviously, are inno such danger.Proclaiming women’s independence from and equality with men, Women’s Lib demandsliberation from the consequences of whatever sex life a woman might choose, suchconsequences to be borne by others: it demands free abortions and freeday-nurseries. To be paid for - by whom? By men.The sex views professed by Women’s Lib are so hideous that they cannot bediscussed—at least, not by me. To regard man as an enemy - to regard woman as acombination matriarch and stevedore—to surpass the futile sordidness of a classwar by instituting a sex war—to drag sex into politics and around the floor ofsmoke-filled back rooms, as a tool of the pressure-group jockeying for power—toproclaim spiritual sisterhood with lesbians, and to swear eternal hostility tomen—is so repulsive a set of premises from so loathsome a sense of life that anaccurate commentary would require the kind of language I do not like to see inprint.(I regard myself as surpassed by Women’s Lib in one respect: I did not know thatit was possible to blow up the character of Comrade Sonia to such giganticproportions.)Is there something worse than the women of the Lib movement? Yes. The men whosupport it. The fact that there are such men is a clue to that grotesquephenomenon.Every other pressure group has some semi-plausible complaint or pretense at acomplaint, as an excuse for existing. Women’s Lib has none. But it has a commondenominator with the others, the indispensable element of a modern pressuregroup: a claim based on weakness. It is because men are metaphysically thedominant sex and are regarded (though for the wrong reasons) as the strongerthat a thing such as Women’s Lib could gain plausibility and sympathy amongtoday’s intellectuals. It represents a rebellion against masculine strength,against strength as such, by those who neither attempt nor intend to developit—and thus it is the clearest giveaway of what all the other rebellions areafter.To the credit of the majority of American women, the Lib movement did not goover too well. But neither did the college activists nor the hippies nor thenature-lovers. Yet these are the loudest voices we hear in public and these arethe snarling figures we see on television screens, displaying their sores andbrandishing their fists. These are the commandos of the haters’ army, who crawlout of the sewer of centuries and shake themselves in public, splattering muckover the passers-by, over the streets, the plate-glass windows and the cleanwhite sheets of newspapers, where the drippings are scrambled into a long,steady whine that strives to induce guilt and to receive “compassion” in return.The passers-by are the rest of us, who have to live, breathe and work in thisatmosphere.No, the majority of people are not haters of the good. The majority aredisgusted by all those pathological manifestations. But a chronic experience ofdisgust in looking at the state of one’s society is not conducive to respect,mutual confidence or good will among men. A chronic spectacle of grotesqueposturing, unintelligible proclamations, incomprehensible demands, inexplicablecontradictions, sordid ugliness, unopposed brutality, cynical injustice—thespectacle of aggressive malice being answered by maudlin, sentimentalappeasement—will erode the morale and the morality of all but the mostexceptional men.The process of erosion starts with bewilderment and goes on to discouragement,to frustration, to bitterness, to fear, inwardly to withdrawal into a fog ofsubjectivity, outwardly to mistrust of all men—then to the gradual paralysis ofthe quest for values, to hopelessness, and to a blind hatred of everything andeveryone, resembling the behavior of the actual haters who manipulated it all.The manipulators are the intellectuals, i.e., those who disseminate ideas andwhose professional work lies in the field of the humanities. The majority ofpeople, guided by nothing but common sense and naive, unidentified feelings, arestill groping blindly for the guidance of reason. They do not know that theirguides, the intellectuals, have long since abandoned reason in favor of feelingswhich they, the victims, can neither grasp nor believe. The clearest example ofthe psychological abyss between the people and the intellectuals was theirrespective reactions to Apollo 11.The intellectuals themselves are part-victims, part-killers. Who, then, are thekillers? The small—frighteningly small—minority who, by the grace of default,have monopolized the field of philosophy and, by the grace of Immanuel Kant,have dedicated it to the propagation of hatred of the good for being the good.But this type of hatred is ancient. Modem philosophy is merely itsmunitions-maker and rationalizer, not its cause. What is the cause? The answerlies in the nature of man’s consciousness.Man cannot deal with reality on the merely perceptual level of awareness; hissurvival requires a conceptual method of mental functioning—but the conceptuallevel of awareness is volitional. Man may choose to function conceptually ornot. Most men stumble through the transition from the predominantly perceptualfunctioning of childhood to the conceptual functioning of adulthood with variousdegrees of success, and settle on some precarious mixture of both methods. Thehater of the good is the man who did not make this transition. He is a case ofarrested psycho-epistemological development.The hater’s mental functioning remains on the level of childhood. Nothing isfully real to him except the concrete, the perceptually given, i.e., theimmediate moment without past or future. He has learned to speak, but has nevergrasped the process of conceptualization. Concepts, to him, are merely some sortof code signals employed by other people for some inexplicable reason, signalsthat have no relation to reality or to himself. He treats concepts as if theywere percepts, and their meaning changes with any change of circumstances.Whatever he learns or happens to retain is treated, in his mind, as if it hadalways been there, as if it were an item of direct awareness, with no memory ofhow he acquired it—as a random store of unprocessed material that comes and goesat the mercy of chance.This is the crucial difference between his mentality and that of a child: anormal child is intensely active in seeking knowledge. The hater stands still;he does not seek knowledge—he “exposes himself” to “experience,” hoping, ineffect, that it will push something into his mind; if nothing happens, he feelswith self-righteous rancor that there is nothing he can do about it. Mentalaction, i.e., mental effort—any sort of processing, identifying, organizing,integrating, critical evaluation or control of his mental content—is an alienrealm which he spends his twisted lifetime struggling to escape. His is asstagnant a mentality as a human being can sustain on the edge of the borderlineseparating passivity from psychosis.A mind that seeks to escape effort and to function automatically, is left at themercy of the inner phenomenon over which it has no direct control: emotions.Psycho-epistemologically (any conscious assertions to the contrarynotwithstanding), a hater regards his emotions as irreducible and irresistible,as a power he cannot question or disobey. But emotions come from automatizedvalue-judgments, which come from abstract, metaphysical premises. The hater hasno lasting value-judgments, only the random urges of a given moment. Hisemotions, therefore, are not great passions to which he sacrifices hisintellect, they are not overpowering demons, but smutty little imps, transient,superficial and incredibly banal. He is moved, not by desires, but by whims.How does a human being descend to such a state? There are differentpsychological reasons, but—in pattern—the process of self-stultification isinitiated by the child who lies too often and gets away with it. In his early,formative years, when he needs to learn the mental processes required to graspthe great unknown surrounding him, reality, he learns the opposite. He learns,in effect, that he can get whatever he wants not by observing facts, but byinventing them and by cheating, begging, threatening (throwing tantrums), i.e.,by manipulating the adults. He concludes implicitly that reality is his enemy,since he has to fake it—to lie—in order to obtain what he wants, that the truthwould defeat him and that he’d better not be concerned with it. Reality does notobey him, it frustrates his wishes, it is impervious to his feelings, it doesnot respond to him as the adults do; but, he feels, it is a negligible enemy,since he has the power to defeat it by means of nothing but his own imagination,which commands the mysteriously omnipotent adults who can do what he is unableto do: circumvent reality somehow and satisfy his whims.Gradually, these subconscious conclusions are automatized in his mind, in theform of a habitual, ambivalent feeling: a sneaky sense of triumph—and a sense ofinferiority, since he is helpless when left on his own. He counteracts it bytelling himself that he is superior, since he can deceive anyone; and, seekingreassurance, he multiplies the practice of deception. Wordlessly, as an implicitpremise, he acquires the belief that his means of survival is his ability tomanipulate others. At a certain stage of his development, he acquires the onlyauthentic and permanent emotion he will ever be able to experience: fear.As he grows up, the fear grows proportionately. He becomes aware of hisimpotence in the face of a reality as unknown to him as it was in his childhood,only now it is a dark, menacing, demanding unknown that confronts him withproblems he cannot handle (but others, somehow, can). He is able to grasp thegiven, the immediately present, but that is not enough: he is unable tointegrate it to anything. He is trapped between two gaping black holes he hasnever learned to consider: yesterday and tomorrow. He has no way of knowing what(deserved) dangers will spring at him suddenly from behind or are lying in waitfor him ahead (he senses only that they are. deserved). He senses that there issomething wrong with him, with his mind, some terrible defect which must behidden from everyone, above all from himself, at any price. He is torn by theconflict of two contradictory desires which he dares not identify: the retardedchild’s desire to be led, protected, told what to do—and the manipulator’sdesire to seek reassurance by reasserting his power of command over others.At this stage, two different roads are open to such persons. Most of them seekthe safety of stagnation and vanish into some venomous obscurity where - asslatternly housewives or incompetent clerks—they contribute to the misery ofanyone they deal with, curse existence, damn mankind, and chortle with glee whenthey hear of someone’s failure or misfortune.But those of a more ambitious and pretentious kind take a different road. A manof this type decides to brazen it out—and cashes in on his childhood scorn ofconceptualization. Language, to him, is merely some arbitrary code of signalswhich he can manipulate without having to confront reality. It was by means oflanguage that he used to control others—it is by means of language that he willnow attempt to control them. Such, in pattern, is the birth of the intellectualwho believes that ideas are tools of deception.Psychologists have observed a phenomenon called “the idiot-savant,” a man whohas the mentality of a moron, but, for some as yet undiscovered reason, is ableto perform a prodigy’s feats of arithmetical calculation. The hater of the goodbecomes a similar phenomenon: “the idiot-philosopher,” a man who is unable tograsp the relation of ideas to reality, but devotes his life to the manufacture,propagation and manipulation of ideas—as a means of sustaining hispseudo-self-esteem.The ideas of such philosophers (and of their followers) are singularly,startlingly unrelated to reality—like a structure of playing cards made of fog,to be dissolved by the breath of a single fact. Whatever their coilingcomplexity and variations, these ideas have a single, immutable goal: to dig anabyss between man’s mind and reality, and thus to invalidate reality’s agent inhuman affairs, man’s reason—and a single method: the playing on humanweaknesses, doubts and fears, as the fledgling hater played on them in hischildhood.On the basis of his works, I offer Immanuel Kant in evidence, as the archetypeof this species: a system as consistently evil as his cannot be constructedinnocently.If one wonders about the paradox presented by this type of intellectual a manwho seeks a shortcut to escape mental effort, then devotes his life toexcruciating mental contortions—one may observe a similar paradox on thematerial level of existence. It is the case of a man who believes that “onlysuckers work” and seeks a shortcut to wealth by becoming a bank robber, thenspends his life in and out of jails, devoting his brief snatches of freedom tothe excruciating work of devising ingenious schemes for his next bank robbery.The explanation lies in the fact that the mental contexts required to producewealth or to stage a robbery are different, and so are the mental processesinvolved. The production of wealth requires the personal responsibility ofdealing with reality; robbery requires only the outwitting of a few guards orpolicemen. The formulation of philosophical ideas requires the personalresponsibility of observing, judging and integrating the facts of reality on anenormous scale; the faking of ideas requires only the outwitting of careless,frightened or ignorant men. Both the bank robber and the “idiot-philosopher” arepsychological parasites. The basic cause in both cases is the same: a mentaldevelopment arrested by a concrete-bound quest for the unearned. The basicmotivation is the same: an overwhelming terror of reality and the desire toescape it.Man’s need of self-esteem is the hater’s nemesis. Self-esteem is reliance onone’s power to think. It cannot be replaced by one’s power to deceive. Theself-confidence of a scientist and the self-confidence of a con man are notinterchangeable states, and do not come from the same psychological universe.The success of a man who deals with reality augments his self-confidence. Thesuccess of a con man augments his panic.The intellectual con man has only one defense against panic: the momentaryrelief he finds by succeeding at further and further frauds. To preserve hisillusion of superiority becomes his overriding obsession. Superiority—in what?He does not know. He does not function conceptually. He judges people, eventsand actions “instinctively,” i.e., not by what they are, but by what they makehim feel. Putting something over on people makes him feel superior—he has longsince forgotten (and has never fully known) why.He has developed a special kind of “instinct” for appraising people: he can“smell” the presence of weaknesses in people, of pretentiousness, uncertainty,self-doubt and fear—particularly fear (not fear of him, but of their commonenemy: reality). Such people make him feel like “a big shot,” and his act issuccessful among them. But when he meets the better type of man, he goes topieces: what he feels is terror. It is by means of his own terror that herecognizes authentic self-confidence.The man of authentic self-confidence is the man who relies on the judgment ofhis own mind. Such a man is not malleable; he may be mistaken, he may be fooledin a given instance, but he is inflexible in regard to the absolutism ofreality, i.e., in seeking and demanding truth. The manipulator feels impotentand in mortal danger; his terror of the man is not personal, but metaphysical:he feels stripped of his means of survival.There is only one source of authentic self-confidence: reason. Hence theintellectual con man’s impassioned hatred of reason and of all itsmanifestations and consequences: of intelligence, of certainty, of ambition, ofsuccess, of achievement, of virtue, of happiness, of pride. All these arephenomena from a universe that would destroy him. Like a creature from the oozeat the bottom of the ocean, he senses a breath of air, which he cannot breathe.Such is the cause and such is the pattern of development whose end product ishatred of the good for being the good.At this final stage, moved by nothing but his feelings, the hater cannot tellwhat makes him act, he is aware only of the hatred and of an overwhelmingcompulsion to destroy. He does not know what long-since-forgotten whims he ispaying for now, he does not know what goal he is trying to achieve—he has nogoals, no desires, no whims any longer, his quest for pleasure has peteredout—he has nothing to gain or to seek, his hatred is aimless and whollynonvenal, all he knows is that he must destroy—destroy the bright, thesparkling, the smiling, the clean, destroy “the light bulb look” on a child’sface—destroy, in order to preserve in the universe the possibility that somepotential whim will succeed, even when he has no whim in sight and none topursue any longer.To explain the nature of his feeling, he snatches rationalizations at random, ashe had snatched them all his life. “This man,” he cries, “is arrogant andselfish! ... He defies the gods or the will of God! ... He is intransigent,intractable, inflexible! ... He defies the will of the people! He endangers thecommon good! He is a threat to his fellow-men, whom he robs, despoils andexploits! ... He is cold, unfeeling, unloving! ... He is immoral: he does notforgive! ... He has invented morality to make us feel guilty! ... He is thecause of all the misery on earth! ... We are poor, because he’s rich ... we areweak, because he’s strong ... we suffer, because he’s happy ... We couldn’t helpit, couldn’t help it, couldn’t help it! No one can blame us, all men are equal!Who does he think he is?” The frenzy deflects the knowledge of the answer: he isa man.The desire to escape that answer is the motive that attracts so many haters tothe intellectual professions today—as they were attracted to philosophy or toits primitive precursor, religion, through all the ages. There have always beenmen of arrested mental development who, dreading reality, found psychologicalprotection in the art of incapacitating the minds of others.It takes many years for a man (and many, many centuries for mankind) to graspthe fact that, in order to live, man needs a comprehensive view of existence,which he relies on, consciously or not. But the formulation of such a view isthe most difficult of human endeavors—and (with a few exceptions, to whommankind owes its lives) rats rushed in where lions feared to tread. While othermen were busy struggling to live, the haters were busy undercutting their meansof survival—in the primitive jungle, in ancient Greece or in the United Statesof America.Today, while America’s best minds go into the physical professions—where realityis harder (but not impossible) to fake—the realm of philosophy, abandoned like avacant lot, has become overgrown with Kantian weeds and overrun with Kantiansquatters. Weeds, if unchecked, will grow faster than other plants and willconsume the nourishment of flowers, of trees, of orchards, of farms, then willsprout through the cracks of the cement at the foundation of impregnableskyscrapers which is the spectacle we are seeing today.The haters are in control of our culture and in the open. They have dropped thepretense of such covers as God, The People, The Future or even Love. Theyproclaim pure hatred of the good—of man, of reason, of values, of existence—inclassrooms, in drawing rooms, in public halls, in theaters, in books, inpaintings, in the streets, by land, by sea, by air and through the gutter.Their G.H.Q. is in the field of education, which they control. “Progressive”schools are manufacturing haters wholesale. The hordes they have produced areroaming the land, proclaiming the rule of the “Now” which is the confession ofan arrested, perceptual mentality that cannot project the future, cannot hold atheory, a purpose or a value, can do nothing but hate and destroy. This is theinvasion of Western civilization by psycho-epistemological barbarians. They howland brandish the tag of “Liberation.” According to their philosophicalchieftain, what they demand is liberation from reality. It is as simple and openas that.What does this do to normal men? At a time when they need it most, they are leftwithout a remnant of philosophical guidance. If they struggle to make sense outof what they see, they encounter so much irrationality, such a chaos ofinexplicable evil, that they begin to believe that reality in fact is thenightmare constructed by the hater’s imagination. Some of them give up, somejoin the hordes, some take the blame for their failure to understand, somecontinue to struggle day by day with no thought of past or future. One cannotfight when one does not understand—and when the voices of craven appeasers keepstriving to whitewash the nature of the enemy.As long as men believe that they are facing “misguided idealists” —or“rebellious youth”—or “a counter-culture”—or “a new morality”—or the transitionperiod of a changing world, or an irresistible historical process, or even aninvincibly powerful monster—confusion undercuts their will to resist, andintellectual self-defense is impossible. It is imperative to grasp that this isnot the time for temporizing, compromising and self-deception. It is necessaryfully to understand the nature of the enemy and his mentality.There is no giant behind the devastation of the world—only a shriveled creaturewith the wizened face of a child who is out to blow up the kitchen because hecannot steal his cookies and eat them, too. “Take a look at [him] now, when youface your last choice—and if you choose to perish, do so with full knowledge ofhow cheaply how small an enemy has claimed your life.” (Atlas Shrugged. )What is the weapon one needs to fight such an enemy? For once, it is 1 who willsay that love is the answer—love in the actual meaning of the word, which is theopposite of the meaning they give it- love as a response to values, love of thegood for being the good. If you hold on to the vision of any value you love—yourmind, your work, your wife or husband, or your child—and remember that that iswhat the enemy is after, your shudder of rebellion will give you the moral fire,the courage and the intransigence needed in this battle. What fuel can supportone’s fire? Love for man at his highest potential. (July-August 1971)"},{"pageContent":"THE POLITICS005 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_005_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"The Left: Old and NewIf you happened to see Sign of the Pagan, a very bad movie recently shown ontelevision, dealing with Attila’s invasion of Europe, you may have noticed thatAttila kept an astrologer by his side, as his only adviser, and consulted himbefore undertaking every bloody new campaign. You may have felt a touch ofsuperiority (which Western man took fifteen centuries to earn), best expressedby the sentence: “It can’t happen now.” You may have regarded the reliance onastrology as crude, primitive or amusing, but quite appropriate to Attila;besides, he had nothing but clubs and swords to devastate the world with.Would you find it amusing if you saw the same Attila balancing a nuclear bomb inthe palm of his hand and consulting the astrologer on whether to toss it?Well, you can see it or, rather, you can hear it being announced in advance andwelcomed, not in the scriptures of the Huns, but in a magazine regarded assafely reputable, read by respectable commuters of the somewhat conservativetype—not in A.D. 450, but in Time magazine on December 19, 1969.A piece entitled “The Next Decade: A Search for Goals” begins by invoking thesanction of astrology, as justification for its prophecies about the comingdecade. The present motion of the planet Neptune, it seems, is a “sign ofidealism and spiritual values,” which will work “a profound change” in people’sways of thinking and acting.“Just possibly,” declares—no, not Attila’s adviser, but Time magazine, “theastrologers may be proved right.... In the long run, this decade and the nextmay well constitute an historical era of transition, like that which followedthe Middle Ages and preceded the Renaissance.“The veneration of rationality was the special myth of modern man. The worldview created by the enthronement of reason included a universal belief inindividualism and competition; now that myth is dying. Faith in science andtechnology has given way to fear of their consequences ... The culturalrevolution of the ‘60s that emphasized Dionysian rather than Apollonian virtueswill continue into the ’70s.”Nothing but astrology could justify a statement of this kind. It is embarrassingto have to comment on it. But for the benefit of the very young, I will pointout a few things that should be almost self-evident.The Middle Ages were an era of mysticism, ruled by blind faith and blindobedience to the dogma that faith is superior to reason. The Renaissance wasspecifically the rebirth of reason, the liberation of man’s mind, the triumph ofrationality over mysticism—a faltering, incomplete, but impassioned triumph thatled to the birth of science, of individualism, of freedom.I have no way of knowing whether Time’s statement came from ignorance or worse.I know only that when I advocate the supremacy of reason, I do not equate itwith a historical period exemplifying its opposite. But this is an Apollonian,not a Dionysian, virtue.There is one element of truth in that quotation and it is interesting to findsuch an admission in such a context: the fact that reason leads to (and is thefoundation of) individualism and competition, i.e., capitalism. Capitalism’senemies know it. Its alleged friends are still twisting themselves intodouble-jointed pretzels in the struggle to evade that knowledge.Let me also remind you that reason is the faculty that identifies and integratesthe material provided by man’s senses—i.e., that reason is man’s only means ofgrasping reality and of acquiring knowledge—and, therefore, the rejection ofreason means that men should act regardless of and/or in contradiction to thefacts of reality.One of these facts is the existence of nuclear weapons. If men discard “the mythof rationality,” by what means will they decide whether to use these weapons,when, where and against whom? They will have nothing but their Dionysian“instincts” and their astrologers to guide them. Attila was a piker compared toa prospect of this kind.This does not seem to deter the Time prophet, who speaks of the fear engenderedby the “consequences” of “science and technology.” Nuclear weapons are hisideological brothers’ main reproach against science and their main instrument ofintellectual terrorization. But if this, in fact, were their fear and theirmotive, they would have become passionate advocates of reason overnight: theywould have known that a hydrogen bomb cannot descend on a city of its ownvolition—and they would have known that for this reason, among many others,mankind cannot afford irrationality any longer. But that is not their fear ortheir motive.“It is possible,” Time goes on, “that the hippie may have pioneered—in spirit,at least—the way men will live and think [?] in the next decade....Individualism may continue to wane as men seek personal identity in groupidentity.... Marshall McLuhan predicts confidently: ‘We are going through atribal cycle once again, but this time we are wide awake.’ ”How one manages to be “wide awake” when one has rejected reason, and how one candescribe as “wide awake” the specifically out-of-focus, zombie-like state oftrance characteristic of and necessitated by a tribal mentality, Time does notexplain. It is only Apollonians, not Dionysians, that require explanations.“While industrial technology will provide a dazzling variety of innovativegadgets, from phonovision to computers for the home, possession will be less ofan ideal. When goods are needed, says Buckminster Fuller [a bright young man of75], more and more will be rented rather than bought. ‘Ownership,’ says Fuller,‘is obsolete.’ ”Another youthful authority, the Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin, predicted,according to Time, that “the U.S. will become a ‘late sensate society’ ... Bythis he meant the glorification of pleasure over Puritan duty, of leisure overwork.” Mr. Sorokin, a thoroughly Russian mystic-altruist, was born in 1889. Theyoungest of these rebels and trend-setters for youth is Marshall McLuhan, aged59. I suppose when one writes under the aegis of astrology, one cannot be toochoosy about the sort of authorities one quotes. But the hippies should observewho molded their docile minds and plastic souls, and how much novelty ororiginality is contained in the moth-eaten notions they spout.“Education for enrichment or amusement,” Time marches on, “rather than forprofessional skills will become a lifetime process . . . In fact, says MarshallMcLuhan, older people will have to go back to school to learn basic skills. Theyoung, he says, are not interested in the mundane knowledge it takes to run atechnological civilization; the old will have to learn it if they are to keeptheir world running.” Why should they want to? What if they shrug? No answer isgiven.Time is not indifferent, however, to the continuation of that world. “All this[the Dionysian Utopia of the future],” the article declares, “will depend on thecontinued expansion of the U.S. economy, which virtually all experts agree willtake place.... Business will be operating in a new, probably tougher atmosphere.While profit will still be the prime mover, some of the money once consideredthe stockholders’ will have to be sacrificed to the needs of society and topollution control.”Further on, a faint note of apprehension creeps into the euphoric prophecy: “Itmay be that the early ’70s will see a period of repressive reaction against theDionysian tendencies of the young.... It is possible, too, that a decline in thework ethic or a weakening of demand for material goods may disrupt thefoundation of a hedonist civilization—the economy.”After considering this possibility for two paragraphs, Time concludes:“Possible—but not likely, for at least the greater part of the decade.” Observethe length and range of concern of these supposedly responsible socialcommentators. What is to happen after a decade of that kind? It is onlyApollonians who look that far; Dionysians do not and cannot.As for other predictions: “The most significant trend of the ’70s may well be areligious revival. . . . In reaction against the trend toward secularization[i.e., toward rationality], there may well be a sweeping revival offundamentalism, particularly in its fervent, Pentecostal variety.... Many peoplewill reject traditional Western religions, finding inspiration and solace in themystery cults of the East or in eclectic spiritual systems of their owndevising.... For many, astrology, numerology and phrenology will become nolonger fads but ways of life.”As to art: “The changed atmosphere will affect the arts as well, which maybecome ephemeral, instant, faddish and ultimately disposable.” Here the prophetis confessing his estimate of the arts of the present by projecting it into thefuture. Except for the wrong tense, the estimate is right. “Ephemeral, instant,faddish and ultimately disposable” is a euphemism for: junk that cannot lastovernight, is not needed by anyone, has no value but that ofclique-press-agentry, and ultimately belongs in the trash can.In the ugliest form, this is a confirmation of the metaphysical nature of art:Dionysian brutes who reject reason and live on the sensations of the immediatemoment have no capacity for a metaphysical view of life and no need of art,beyond the Halloween masks or New Year’s Eve hats that the charwomen of historywill sweep up wearily the next morning.Under the subtitle “Man and Environment,” a lengthy section of the Time articleis devoted to the subject of pollution. “Government and business will be forcedto spend ever increasing sums possibly $10 billion to $20 billion a year, inHerman Kahn’s estimate—to control pollution of air and water and to prevent thedestruction of natural beauty.” (Italics mine.) And: “In the next few years ...it will be widely recognized that like most forms of pollution, defiling of thelandscape, whether it be with shopping centers or expressways, is hard toreverse.”The word “pollution” implies health hazards, such as smog or dirty waters. Butthese are not the article’s main concern; observe that they are lumped togetherinto one package dealing with such matters as “natural beauty” and that thepollutants threatening us are shopping centers and expressways.Young men who live under the nightmare threat of the military draft should alsoobserve that the people who propose to spend $10 to $20 billion a year on thepreservation of “natural beauty” regard $4 billion a year as too high a price topay for a volunteer army.The real motive behind the anti-pollution campaign is stated all but explicitly:“As the decade advances, it will become clear that if the ecological effort isto succeed, much of today’s existing technology will have to be scrapped andsomething new developed in its place. [”You’ll do something, Mr. Rearden!“] ...Increasingly, it will be seen that any kind of mass transportation, howeverpowered, is more efficient than the family car. [Such as the New York subway,for instance?] ... Planning will have to be a much greater concern.”And here is the motive behind the motive: “The attitude, central to the modernmind, that all technology is good technology will have to be changed radically.‘Our society is trained to accept all new technology as progress, or to lookupon it as an aspect of fate,’ says George Wald, Harvard’s Nobel-laureatebiologist. ‘Should one do everything one can? The usual answer is “Of course”;but the right answer is “Of course not.” ’. . .“Bertrand de Jouvenal adds: ‘Western man has not lived with his naturalenvironment. He has merely conquered it.’ ”By the grace of Aristotle, of Galileo, of Pasteur, of Edison and of a long, thinline of often-martyred men stretching back through millennia, Western man hasnot lived with his natural environment, in the sense intended by that quotation.But the rest of mankind has and does.An Asian peasant who labors through all of his waking hours, with tools createdin Biblical times—a South American aborigine who is devoured by piranha in ajungle stream—an African who is bitten by the tsetse fly—an Arab whose teeth aregreen with decay in his mouth—these do live with their “natural environment,”but are scarcely able to appreciate its beauty. Try to tell a Chinese mother,whose child is dying of cholera: “Should one do everything one can? Of coursenot.” Try to tell a Russian housewife, who trudges miles on foot in sub-zeroweather in order to spend hours standing in line at a state store dispensingfood rations, that America is defiled by shopping centers, expressways andfamily cars.It is not possible that the “anti-pollution”—i.e., anti-technology—crusaders areignorant of man’s condition in the midst of an unconquered nature. It does notseem possible that, knowing it, they would advocate its return. But there it is,out of their own mouth.The thing that permits men to utter public statements which, if believed, wouldcause people to run from them as from lepers, is the fact that no one believesit. Most people have been conditioned to regard broad generalizations, abstractideas, fundamental principles and logical consequences as impotent, irrelevant,invalid or non-existent. “Aw, they don’t mean it,” is the general attitudetoward the anti-technologists, “they don’t want to go that far. They just wantto clean up the smog and the sewage.” Well, Hitler, too, announced his abstractprinciples and goals in advance, and evoked a similar reaction from thepragmatists of the time. The Soviets have openly preached world conquest forfifty years and have conquered one-third of the globe’s population—yet somepeople still do not believe that they mean it.(As far as the issue of actual pollution is concerned, it is primarily ascientific, not a political, problem. In regard to the political principleinvolved: if a man creates a physical danger or harm to others, which extendsbeyond the line of his own property, such as unsanitary conditions or even loudnoise, and if this is proved, the law can and does hold him responsible. If thecondition is collective, such as in an overcrowded city, appropriate andobjective laws can be defined, protecting the rights of all those involved—aswas done in the case of oil rights, air-space rights, etc. But such laws cannotdemand the impossible, must not be aimed at a single scapegoat, i.e., theindustrialists, and must take into consideration the whole context of theproblem, i.e., the absolute necessity of the continued existence of industry—ifthe preservation of human life is the standard.)It has been reported in the press many times that the issue of pollution is tobe the next big crusade of the New Left activists, after the war in Vietnampeters out. And just as peace was not their goal or motive in that crusade, soclean air is not their goal or motive in this one.There is a significant change in the leftist-liberal ideology of today, adifference between the old left and the new—not in essential goals orfundamental motives, but in their forms—and the Time article is an unusuallyeloquent demonstration of it.In a certain sense, the line of the New Left is cruder and more honest—nothonest in an honorable sense of the word, but in the sense of a combination ofbrazenness and despair, prompted by the belief or the hope that one can get awaywith it, as a drunk (or a drug addict) will blurt out some part of a truth hehas spent years evading and repressing. The social veneer of the collectivistsis cracking and their psychological motivation is showing through.The old left had spent years of effort, tons of print, billions of dollars andrivers of blood to maintain an Apollonian mask. Old-line Marxists claimed thatthey were champions of reason, that socialism or communism was a scientificsocial system, that an advanced technology could not function in a capitalistsociety, but required a scientifically planned and organized human community tobring its maximum benefits to every man, in the form of material comforts and ahigher standard of living. They predicted that the progress of Soviet technologywould surpass that of the United States. They accused capitalist societies ofdeluding the masses by means of the policy known as “pie in the sky,” i.e., bymeans of promising spiritual rewards to those suffering from material poverty.Communist propagandists even accused some governments—notably, the old rulers ofChina and the British in India—of deliberately fostering the drug traffic inorder to keep the masses passive, dazed, docile and impotent.That mask crumbled in the aftermath of World War 11.In full view of the fate of industry and the standard of living in SovietRussia, in socialist Britain, in the communist countries of Europe, no one canclaim very loudly or very effectively the technological superiority of socialismover capitalism. The old line to the effect that capitalism was necessary tocreate an industrial civilization, but not to maintain it, is not heard toooften these days. The promises of socialist abundance are not very convincing ina world where most of the working youth worship American products and gadgets,and would swim the ocean, if they could, to come to America—and the promises ofsocialism’s liberation of man’s mind ring hollow in a world made progressivelymore anxious by the drain of its best brains.There was a time when the necessity of industrialization was the crusadingslogan of Western liberals, which justified anything and whitewashed anyatrocity, including the wholesale slaughter in Soviet Russia. We do not hearthat slogan any longer. Confronted with the choice of an industrial civilizationor collectivism, it is an industrial civilization that the liberals discarded.Confronted with the choice of technology or dictatorship, it is technology thatthey discarded. Confronted with the choice of reason or whims, it is reason thatthey discarded.And so today we see the spectacle of old Marxists blessing, aiding and abettingthe young hoodlums (who are their products and heirs) who proclaim thesuperiority of feelings over reason, of faith over knowledge, of leisure overproduction, of spiritual concerns over material comforts, of primitive natureover technology, of astrology over science, of drugs over consciousness.The old-line Marxists used to claim that a single modern factory could produceenough shoes to provide for the whole population of the world and that nothingbut capitalism prevented it. When they discovered the facts of reality involved,they declared that going barefoot is superior to wearing shoes.So much for their concern with poverty and with the improvement of human life onearth.At a superficial (a very superficial) glance, there might have been, for themorally undiscriminating, some plausibility in the notion of enslaving andsacrificing generations of men for the sake of establishing a permanent state ofmaterial abundance for all. But to do it for the sake of preserving “naturalbeauty”? To replace the union of bloody thugs and ivory-tower intellectuals,which was gruesome enough, with a union of bloody thugs and ladies’ gardenclubs?In form, if not in essence, the old-line Marxists were cleaner.But the essence—the fundamental principles, the psychological motivation, theultimate goal—of the leftist-liberals has not changed. The essence is hatred ofreason—whether it takes the cover of “the mystics of muscle” or drops the maskand opts for the “spirituality” of the jungle, whether it preaches dialecticmaterialism or replaces it with doctrines of equal scientific validity:astrology, numerology, phrenology.The forms may vary, the slogans may change, everything may be dispensable in theHeraclitean-Hegelian-Dionysian flux, but three fundamentals remain untouched:mysticism-altruism-collectivism. And so does their psychological manifestation:the lust for power, i.e., the lust to destroy.The activists of the New Left are closer to revealing the truth of theirmotives: they do not seek to take over industrial plants, they seek to destroytechnology.Commentators such as the Time prophet(s) are not necessarily aware of the fullphilosophical meaning and consequences of their statements: they have beeninoculated against ideas by the same Pragmatism in the same colleges as theirvictims. A typical modern intellectual is not consciously eager to destroy atechnological society or the last remnants of capitalism in a mixed economy. Hemerely swims with the “mainstream” and seeks to create “a tougher atmosphere”for businessmen, never doubting that they will always deliver the goods oranything demanded of them. He slings ideas for a living, as others sling hash.But that the victims stand for it, that the advocacy of raw nature and astrologyis voiced without any noticeable protest—that is the culturally ominous andsignificant aspect of the Time article. It is an indication of the degree oftoday’s contempt for the intellect. It is a demonstration of the bankruptcy ofthe left—and of the vacuum in a culture whose respect for the mind has beendestroyed by generations of Kantian-pragmatist-linguistic philosophizing.As far as the left is concerned, its new line is a grotesque caricature of theold and, therefore, revealing, as caricatures often are. Hatred of reason leadsto fear of reality; since fear has always been the intense motivational emotionof the leftists, it is fear that they have always used as their chiefpsychological tool of propaganda, apparently in the belief that it has asirresistible a power in the consciousness of others as in their own.With the destruction of capitalism as their unalterable goal, they tried, atfirst, to engender economic fear—by spreading the notion that capitalism leadsto general impoverishment and the concentration of wealth in fewer and fewerhands. This line was somewhat successful in Europe, but not in this country,where the factual evidence to the contrary was too obviously clear.The next leftist line was fear of the atom bomb, accompanied by the suggestionthat we should surrender to communism without a fight, in order to avoiduniversal destruction. Do you remember the slogan: “Better Red than dead”? Thisdid not go over, either—not in this country, nor among any men or animals with avestige of self-esteem.If, after the failure of such accusations as: “Capitalism leads you to thepoorhouse” and “Capitalism leads you to war,” the New Left is left with nothingbetter than: “Capitalism defiles the beauty of your countryside,” one mayjustifiably conclude that, as an intellectual power, the collectivist movementis through.But the leftists may still have a chance—by default. A society cannot exist forlong in an intellectual vacuum. Culturally, we are approaching the stage whereanyone can take over, provided his doctrines are sufficiently irrational. Acultural vacuum produces its own variants of fishers in muddy waters—and, onsuch terms, whoever is the muddiest, wins.In “The Cashing-In: The Student ‘Rebellion’ ”(The Objectivist Newsletter,July-September 1965), dealing with the rebellion at Berkeley, I wrote: “For itsmotley leftist leadership, the student rebellion is a trial balloon, a kind ofcultural temperature-taking. it is a test of how much they can get away with andwhat sort of opposition they will encounter.” I wrote also that the mainideological purpose of the rebellion’s leaders was “to condition the country toaccept force as the means of settling political controversies.”Observe the extent of the spread of violence since that time, and the condoning,excusing, endorsement and/or advocacy of violence by the public voices of today.An article such as the Time prophecy is one of the trial balloons of a similarkind, as are all the hooligan tactics of the New Left: it is part of a test tofind out how much they can get away with philosophically, i.e., how far thedestruction of reason has gone.I asked an intelligent young friend of mine how college students could read suchan article without protesting. “But they don’t read it,” she answered. “Theyread only the news sections. At most, they skim through the editorial stuff,barely getting some fuzzy approximation.” This, of course, applies tobusinessmen as well.And this is the real danger in articles of that kind: not that the readers willagree—they are not expected to agree—but that their indifference to ideas, tointellectual issues and to long-range thinking will be reaffirmed, reinforcedand ultimately turned into mental atrophy.If Ellsworth Toohey were speaking today, he would say to Peter Keating: “We getthem coming and going. Those who believe in astrology will flock to us: we’ll bethe only defenders of their guilty weakness. Those who don’t believe in it willbe so disgusted, indignant and frustrated that they’ll give up the realm ofideas—and of reason—anyway. Intellectual paralysis, Peter. Whether caused bydrugs, or by bitter skepticism, or by unbearable disgust, doesn’t make anydifference—so long as they stop thinking and give up, give up, give up ...”If businessmen are willing to ignore the proclamations of the New Left and toserve as milch cows for brazen, nature-loving hoodlums—they deserve what theywill get.But the young do not deserve it—not those among the young who are suffocating intoday’s atmosphere and are groping blindly for some glimmer of rationality. Itis they who should fight for their precarious foothold on reason, which is nowbeing systematically undercut.The first step of the battle is to realize that their enemy is not thescreeching Dionysian hippie-puppets, but those exponents of middle-of-the-roadrespectability who tell them gently, in their classrooms, that words, ideas andphilosophy do not matter and that the Attilas do not mean it. (February 1970)"},{"pageContent":"From a SymposiumThe New Left does not portend a revolution, as its press agents claim, but aPutsch. A revolution is the climax of a long philosophical development andexpresses a nation’s profound discontent; a Putsch is a minority’s seizure ofpower. The goal of a revolution is to overthrow tyranny; the goal of a Putsch isto establish it.Tyranny is any political system (whether absolute monarchy or fascism orcommunism) that does not recognize individual rights (which necessarily includeproperty rights). The overthrow of a political system by force is justified onlywhen it is directed against tyranny: it is an act of self-defense against thosewho rule by force. For example, the American Revolution. The resort to force,not in defense, but in violation, of individual rights, can have no moraljustification; it is not a revolution, but gang warfare.No revolution was ever spearheaded by wriggling, chanting drug addicts who areboastfully anti-rational, who have no program to offer, yet propose to take overa nation of 200 million, and who spend their time manufacturing grievances,since they cannot tap any authentic source of popular discontent.Physically, America is not in a desperate state, but intellectually andculturally she is. The New Left is the product of cultural disintegration; it isbred not in the slums, but in the universities; it is not the vanguard of thefuture, but the terminal stage of the past.This article was published in The New York Times Magazine, May 17, 1970, as partof a symposium on the question: “Are We in the Middle of the ‘Second AmericanRevolution’?”Intellectually, the activists of the New Left are the most docile conformists.They have accepted as dogma all the philosophical beliefs of their elders forgenerations: the notions that faith and feeling are superior to reason, thatmaterial concerns are evil, that love is the solution to all problems, that themerging of one’s self with a tribe or a community is the noblest way to live.There is not a single basic principle of today’s Establishment which they do notshare. Far from being rebels, they embody the philosophic trend of the past 200years (or longer): the mysticism-altruism-collectivism axis, which has dominatedWestern philosophy from Kant to Hegel to James and on down.But this philosophic tradition is bankrupt. It crumbled in the aftermath ofWorld War II. Disillusioned in their collectivist ideals, America’sintellectuals gave up the intellect. Their legacy is our present politicalsystem, which is not capitalism, but a mixed economy, a precarious mixture offreedom and controls. Injustice, insecurity, confusion, the pressure-groupwarfare of all against all, the amorality and futility of random, pragmatist,range-of-the-moment policies are the joint products of a mixed economy and of aphilosophical vacuum.There is a profound discontent, but the New Left is not its voice; there is asense of bitterness, bewilderment and frustrated indignation, a profound anxietyabout the intellectual-moral state of this country, a desperate need ofphilosophical guidance, which the church-and-tradition-bound conservatives werenever able to provide and the liberals have given up.Without opposition, the hoodlums of the New Left are crawling from under theintellectual wreckage. Theirs is the Anti-Industrial Revolution, the revolt ofthe primordial brute—no, not against capitalism, but against capitalism’sroots—against reason, progress, technology, achievement, reality.What are the activists after? Nothing. They are not pulled by a goal, but pushedby the panic of mindless terror. Hostility, hatred, destruction for the sake ofdestruction are their momentary forms of escape. They are a desperate herdlooking for a Führer.They are not seeking any specific political system, since they cannot lookbeyond the “now.” But the sundry little Führers who manipulate them ascannon-fodder do have a mongrel system in mind: a statist dictatorship withcommunist slogans and fascist policies. It is their last, frantic attempt tocash in on the intellectual vacuum.Do they have a chance to succeed? No. But they might plunge the country into ablind, hopeless civil war, with nothing but some other product ofanti-rationality, such as George C. Wallace, to oppose them.Can this be averted? Yes. The most destructive influence on the nation’s moraleis not the young thugs, but the cynicism of respectable publications that hailthem as “idealists.” Irrationality is not idealistic; drug addiction is notidealistic; the bombing of public places is not idealistic.What this country needs is a philosophical revolution—a rebellion against theKantian tradition—in the name of the first of our Founding Fathers: Aristotle.This means a reassertion of the supremacy of reason, with its consequences:individualism, freedom, progress, civilization. What political system would itlead to? An untried one: full, laissez-faire capitalism. But this will take morethan a beard and a guitar."},{"pageContent":"“Political” CrimesA very dangerous notion is now being smuggled into our cultural atmosphere. Itis being introduced in reverse, in a form that looks like the opposite of itsactual meaning and logical consequences. The form is sympathy for criminals whoclaim to be motivated by political goals; the notion is the legal category of“political crimes.”There can be no such thing as a political crime under the American system oflaw. Since an individual has the right to hold and to propagate any ideas hechooses (obviously including political ideas), the government may not infringehis right; it may neither penalize nor reward him for his ideas; it may not takeany judicial cognizance whatever of his ideology.By the same principle, the government may not give special leniency to theperpetrator of a crime, on the grounds of the nature of his ideas.A crime is a violation of the right(s) of other men by force (or fraud). It isonly the initiation of physical force against others—i.e., the recourse toviolence—that can be classified as a crime in a free society (as distinguishedfrom a civil wrong). Ideas, in a free society, are not a crime—and neither canthey serve as the justification of a crime.If one keeps clearly in mind the moral-legal context (and hierarchicalderivation) of any given political principle, one will not find any difficultyor contradiction in applying it to specific cases. For instance, Americancitizens possess the right to freedom of religion; but if some sect adoptedprimitive beliefs and began to practice human sacrifices, it would be prosecutedfor murder. Clearly, this is not an infringement of the sect’s religiousfreedom; it is the proper application of the principle that all rights arederived from the right to life and that those who violate it cannot claim itsprotection, i.e., cannot claim the right to violate a right. In exactly the sameway, for the same reasons, the unspeakable little drugged monstrosities whoresort to violence—and who have progressed, without significant opposition, fromcampus sit-ins to arson to such an atrocity as mass terrorization and thebombing of public places—should be treated as the criminals they are, and not aspolitical “dissenters.”Morally, they are worse than the plain criminal: he, at least, does not subvertthe realm of ideas; he does not posture as a champion of rights, justice andfreedom. Legally, both kinds should be given the same treatment. Ideas end wherea gun begins.The moral bankruptcy of today’s liberal Establishment (including itsconcomitant: the erosion of the concept of individual rights) is the basic causeof the young thugs’ activities. The granting to these thugs of such titles as“political dissenters” and “idealists” is the major reason of their acceleratinggrowth. The alleged economic justification of their violence the notion that itis caused by poverty—would be inexcusably evil, if the notion were true; but itbecomes grotesque in the light of the mounting evidence that the young thugs arepredominantly children of the well-to-do.There is only one doctrine that can permit this to go on: the morality ofaltruism. I have said that altruism is, in fact, the negation of morality. “Yourcode hands out, as its version of the absolute, the following rule of moralconduct: ... if the motive of your action is your welfare, don’t do it; if themotive is the welfare of others, then anything goes.” (Atlas Shrugged.) You cannow see it demonstrated in practice. If such monstrous actions as bombings areregarded as “idealistic” because the actors profess to be motivated by the“welfare of others”—and the liberal journalists who proclaim this are not hootedout of their profession—then the last vestige of and pretense at morality aregone from today’s culture.The actual motive of whoever manipulates the opinions of the dazed, scaredliberals is fairly obvious: by arousing sympathy for “political” criminals, bystaging protests and demanding leniency from the courts allegedly in the name ofpolitical freedom the statists are establishing the precedent of politicaltrials. Once the issue of ideology is made part of a court’s consideration, theprinciple is established: the government is brought into the courtroom as anarbiter of ideas. If the government assumes the power to exonerate a man on thegrounds of his political ideas, it has assumed the power to prosecute andcondemn him on the same grounds.It is in Europe, under the despotism of absolute monarchies, that a legaldistinction was made between political and non-political crimes. The firstcategory consisted predominantly, not of acts of violence, but of such acts asuttering or publishing ideas that displeased the government. And, in the growingtrend toward political freedom, public opinion was on the side of suchoffenders: they were fighting for individual rights, against the rule of force.If and when the public opinion of a free country accepts a distinction betweenpolitical and non-political criminals, it accepts the notion of politicalcrimes, it supports the use of force in violation of rights—and the historicalprocess takes place in reverse: the country crosses the borderline intopolitical despotism. (May 1970)"},{"pageContent":"RacismRacism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism. It is thenotion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man’s geneticlineage—the notion that a man’s intellectual and characterological traits areproduced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, inpractice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, butby the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors.Racism claims that the content of a man’s mind (not his cognitive apparatus, butits content) is inherited; that a man’s convictions, values and character aredetermined before he is born, by physical factors beyond his control. This isthe caveman’s version of the doctrine of innate ideas—or of inheritedknowledge—which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science. Racism isa doctrine of, by and for brutes. It is a barnyard or stock-farm version ofcollectivism, appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between variousbreeds of animals, but not between animals and men.Like every form of determinism, racism invalidates the specific attribute whichdistinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. Racismnegates two aspects of man’s life: reason and choice, or mind and morality,replacing them with chemical predestination.The respectable family that supports worthless relatives or covers up theircrimes in order to “protect the family name” (as if the moral stature of one mancould be damaged by the actions of another)—the bum who boasts that hisgreat-grandfather was an empire-builder, or the small-town spinster who boaststhat her maternal great-uncle was a state senator and her third cousin gave aconcert at Carnegie Hall (as if the achievements of one man could rub off on themediocrity of another)—the parents who search genealogical trees in order toevaluate their prospective sons-in-law—the celebrity who starts hisautobiography with a detailed account of his family history—all these aresamples of racism, the atavistic manifestations of a doctrine whose fullexpression is the tribal warfare of prehistorical savages, the wholesaleslaughter of Nazi Germany, the atrocities of today’s so-called “newly emergingnations.”The theory that holds “good blood” or “bad blood” as a moral-intellectualcriterion, can lead to nothing but torrents of blood in practice. Brute force isthe only avenue of action open to men who regard themselves as mindlessaggregates of chemicals.Modern racists attempt to prove the superiority or inferiority of a given raceby the historical achievements of some of its members. The frequent historicalspectacle of a great innovator who, in his lifetime, is jeered, denounced,obstructed, persecuted by his countrymen, and then, a few years after his death,is enshrined in a national monument and hailed as a proof of the greatness ofthe German (or French or Italian or Cambodian) race—is as revolting a spectacleof collectivist expropriation, perpetrated by racists, as any expropriation ofmaterial wealth perpetrated by communists.Just as there is no such thing as a collective or racial mind, so there is nosuch thing as a collective or racial achievement. There are only individualminds and individual achievements—and a culture is not the anonymous product ofundifferentiated masses, but the sum of the intellectual achievements ofindividual men.Even if it were proved—which it is not—that the incidence of men of potentiallysuperior brain power is greater among the members of certain races than amongthe members of others, it would still tell us nothing about any given individualand it would be irrelevant to one’s judgment of him. A genius is a genius,regardless of the number of morons who belong to the same race—and a moron is amoron, regardless of the number of geniuses who share his racial origin. It ishard to say which is the more outrageous injustice: the claim of Southernracists that a Negro genius should be treated as an inferior because his racehas “produced” some brutes—or the claim of a German brute to the status of asuperior because his race has “produced” Goethe, Schiller and Brahms.These are not two different claims, of course, but two applications of the samebasic premise. The question of whether one alleges the superiority or theinferiority of any given race is irrelevant; racism has only one psychologicalroot: the racist’s sense of his own inferiority.Like every other form of collectivism, racism is a quest for the unearned. It isa quest for automatic knowledge—for an automatic evaluation of men’s charactersthat bypasses the responsibility of exercising rational or moral judgment—and,above all, a quest for an automatic self-esteem (or pseudo-self-esteem).To ascribe one’s virtues to one’s racial origin, is to confess that one has noknowledge of the process by which virtues are acquired and, most often, that onehas failed to acquire them. The overwhelming majority of racists are men whohave earned no sense of personal identity, who can claim no individualachievement or distinction, and who seek the illusion of a “tribal self-esteem”by alleging the inferiority of some other tribe. Observe the hystericalintensity of the Southern racists; observe also that racism is much moreprevalent among the poor white trash than among their intellectual betters.Historically, racism has always risen or fallen with the rise or fall ofcollectivism. Collectivism holds that the individual has no rights, that hislife and work belong to the group (to “society,” to the tribe, the state, thenation) and that the group may sacrifice him at its own whim to its owninterests. The only way to implement a doctrine of that kind is by means ofbrute force—and statism has always been the political corollary of collectivism.The absolute state is merely an institutionalized form of gang-rule, regardlessof which particular gang seizes power. And—since there is no rationaljustification for such rule, since none has ever been or can ever be offered—themystique of racism is a crucial element in every variant of the absolute state.The relationship is reciprocal: statism rises out of prehistorical tribalwarfare, out of the notion that the men of one tribe are the natural prey forthe men of another—and establishes its own internal subcategories of racism, asystem of castes determined by a man’s birth, such as inherited titles ofnobility or inherited serfdom.The racism of Nazi Germany—where men had to fill questionnaires about theirancestry for generations back, in order to prove their Aryan descent—has itscounterpart in Soviet Russia, where men had to fill similar questionnaires toshow that their ancestors had owned no property and thus to prove theirproletarian descent. The Soviet ideology rests on the notion that men can beconditioned to communism genetically—that is, that a few generations conditionedby dictatorship will transmit communist ideology to their descendants, who willbe communists at birth. The persecution of racial minorities in Soviet Russia,according to the racial descent and whim of any given commissar, is a matter ofrecord; anti-Semitism is particularly prevalent—only the official pogroms arenow called “political purges.”There is only one antidote to racism: the philosophy of individualism and itspolitico-economic corollary, laissez-faire capitalism.Individualism regards man—every man—as an independent, sovereign entity whopossesses an inalienable right to his own life, a right derived from his natureas a rational being. Individualism holds that a civilized society, or any formof association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among men, can be achievedonly on the basis of the recognition of individual rights—and that a group, assuch, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members.It is not a man’s ancestors or relatives or genes or body chemistry that countin a free market, but only one human attribute: productive ability. It is by hisown individual ability and ambition that capitalism judges a man and rewards himaccordingly.No political system can establish universal rationality by law (or by force).But capitalism is the only system that functions in a way which rewardsrationality and penalizes all forms of irrationality, including racism.A fully free, capitalist system has not yet existed anywhere. But what isenormously significant is the correlation of racism and political controls inthe semifree economies of the nineteenth century. Racial and/or religiouspersecutions of minorities stood in inverse ratio to the degree of a country’sfreedom. Racism was strongest in the more controlled economies, such as Russiaand Germany—and weakest in England, the then freest country of Europe.It is capitalism that gave mankind its first steps toward freedom and a rationalway of life. It is capitalism that broke through national and racial barriers,by means of free trade. It is capitalism that abolished serfdom and slavery inall the civilized countries of the world. It is the capitalist North thatdestroyed the slavery of the agrarian-feudal South in the United States.Such was the trend of mankind for the brief span of some hundred and fiftyyears. The spectacular results and achievements of that trend need norestatement here.The rise of collectivism reversed that trend.When men began to be indoctrinated once more with the notion that the individualpossesses no rights, that supremacy, moral authority and unlimited power belongto the group, and that a man has no significance outside his group—theinevitable consequence was that men began to gravitate toward some group oranother, in self-protection, in bewilderment and in subconscious terror. Thesimplest collective to join, the easiest one to identify—particularly for peopleof limited intelligence—the least demanding form of “belonging” and of“togetherness” is: race.It is thus that the theoreticians of collectivism, the “humanitarian” advocatesof a “benevolent” absolute state, have led to the rebirth and the new, virulentgrowth of racism in the twentieth century.In its great era of capitalism, the United States was the freest country onearth—and the best refutation of racist theories. Men of all races came here,some from obscure, culturally undistinguished countries, and accomplished featsof productive ability which would have remained stillborn in theircontrol-ridden native lands. Men of racial groups that had been slaughtering oneanother for centuries, learned to live together in harmony and peacefulcooperation. America had been called “the melting pot,” with good reason. Butfew people realized that America did not melt men into the gray conformity of acollective: she united them by means of protecting their right to individuality.The major victims of such race prejudice as did exist in America were theNegroes. It was a problem originated and perpetuated by the noncapitalist South,though not confined to its boundaries. The persecution of Negroes in the Southwas and is truly disgraceful. But in the rest of the country, so long as menwere free, even that problem was slowly giving way under the pressure ofenlightenment and of the white men’s own economic interests.Today, that problem is growing worse—and so is every other form of racism.America has become race-conscious in a manner reminiscent of the worst days inthe most backward countries of nineteenth-century Europe. The cause is the same:the growth of collectivism and statism.In spite of the clamor for racial equality, propagated by the “liberals” in thepast few decades, the Census Bureau reported recently that “[the Negro’s]economic status relative to whites has not improved for nearly 20 years.” It hadbeen improving in the freer years of our “mixed economy”; it deteriorated withthe progressive enlargement of the “liberals’ ” Welfare State.The growth of racism in a “mixed economy” keeps step with the growth ofgovernment controls. A “mixed economy” disintegrates a country into aninstitutionalized civil war of pressure groups, each fighting for legislativefavors and special privileges at the expense of one another.The existence of such pressure groups and of their political lobbies is openlyand cynically acknowledged today. The pretense at any political philosophy, anyprinciples, ideals or long-range goals is fast disappearing from our scene—andit is all but admitted that this country is now floating without direction, atthe mercy of a blind, short-range power game played by various statist gangs,each intent on getting hold of a legislative gun for any special advantage ofthe immediate moment.In the absence of any coherent political philosophy, every economic group hasbeen acting as its own destroyer, selling out its future for some momentaryprivilege. The policy of the businessmen has, for some time, been the mostsuicidal one in this respect. But it has been surpassed by the current policy ofthe Negro leaders.So long as the Negro leaders were fighting against government-enforceddiscrimination- right, justice and morality were on their side. But that is notwhat they are fighting any longer. The confusions and contradictions surroundingthe issue of racism have now reached an incredible climax.It is time to clarify the principles involved.The policy of the Southern states toward Negroes was and is a shamefulcontradiction of this country’s basic principles. Racial discrimination, imposedand enforced by law, is so blatantly inexcusable an infringement of individualrights that the racist statutes of the South should have been declaredunconstitutional long ago.The Southern racists’ claim of “states’ rights” is a contradiction in terms:there can be no such thing as the “right” of some men to violate the rights ofothers. The constitutional concept of “states’ rights” pertains to the divisionof power between local and national authorities, and serves to protect thestates from the Federal government; it does not grant to a state government anunlimited, arbitrary power over its citizens or the privilege of abrogating thecitizens’ individual rights.It is true that the Federal government has used the racial issue to enlarge itsown power and to set a precedent of encroachment upon the legitimate rights ofthe states, in an unnecessary and unconstitutional manner. But this merely meansthat both governments are wrong; it does not excuse the policy of the Southernracists.One of the worst contradictions, in this context, is the stand of many so-called“conservatives” (not confined exclusively to the South) who claim to bedefenders of freedom, of capitalism, of property rights, of the Constitution,yet who advocate racism at the same time. They do not seem to possess enoughconcern with principles to realize that they are cutting the ground from undertheir own feet. Men who deny individual rights cannot claim, defend or upholdany rights whatsoever. It is such alleged champions of capitalism who arehelping to discredit and destroy it.The “liberals” are guilty of the same contradiction, but in a different form.They advocate the sacrifice of all individual rights to unlimited majorityrule—yet posture as defenders of the rights of minorities. But the smallestminority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights, cannotclaim to be defenders of minorities.This accumulation of contradictions, of shortsighted pragmatism, of cynicalcontempt for principles, of outrageous irrationality, has now reached its climaxin the new demands of the Negro leaders.Instead of fighting against racial discrimination, they are demanding thatracial discrimination be legalized and enforced. Instead of fighting againstracism, they are demanding the establishment of racial quotas. Instead offighting for “color-blindness” in social and economic issues, they areproclaiming that “color-blindness” is evil and that “color” should be made aprimary consideration. Instead of fighting for equal rights, they are demandingspecial race privileges.They are demanding that racial quotas be established in regard to employment andthat jobs be distributed on a racial basis, in proportion to the percentage of agiven race among the local population. For instance, since Negroes constitute 25percent of the population of New York City, they demand 25 percent of the jobsin a given establishment.Racial quotas have been one of the worst evils of racist regimes. There wereracial quotas in the universities of Czarist Russia, in the population ofRussia’s major cities, etc. One of the accusations against the racists in thiscountry is that some schools practice a secret system of racial quotas. It wasregarded as a victory for justice when employment questionnaires ceased toinquire about an applicant’s race or religion.Today, it is not an oppressor, but an oppressed minority group that is demandingthe establishment of racial quotas. (!)This particular demand was too much even for the “liberals.” Many of themdenounced it—property—with shocked indignation.Wrote The New York Times (July 23, 1963): “The demonstrators are following atruly vicious principle in playing the ‘numbers game.’ A demand that 25 percent(or any other percentage) of jobs be given to Negroes (or any other group) iswrong for one basic reason: it calls for a ‘quota system,’ which is in itselfdiscriminatory.... This newspaper has long fought a religious quota in respectto judgeships; we equally oppose a racial quota in respect to jobs from the mostelevated to the most menial.”As if the blatant racism of such a demand were not enough, some Negro leaderswent still farther. Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of the NationalUrban League, made the following statement (New York Times, August 1):“The white leadership must be honest enough to grant that throughout our historythere has existed a special privileged class of citizens who received preferredtreatment. That class was white. Now we’re saying this: If two men, one Negroand one white, are equally qualified for a job, hire the Negro.”Consider the implications of that statement. It does not merely demand specialprivileges on racial grounds—it demands that white men be penalized for the sinsof their ancestors. It demands that a white laborer be refused a job because hisgrandfather may have practiced racial discrimination. But perhaps hisgrandfather had not practiced it. Or perhaps his grandfather had not even livedin this country. Since these questions are not to be considered, it means thatthat white laborer is to be charged with collective racial guilt, the guiltconsisting merely of the color of his skin.But that is the principle of the worst Southern racist who charges all Negroeswith collective racial guilt for any crime committed by an individual Negro, andwho treats them all as inferiors on the ground that their ancestors weresavages.The only comment one can make about demands of that kind, is: “By what right?—Bywhat code?—By what standard?”That absurdly evil policy is destroying the moral base of the Negroes’ fight.Their case rested on the principle of individual rights. If they demand theviolation of the rights of others, they negate and forfeit their own. Then thesame answer applies to them as to the Southern racists: there can be no suchthing as the “right” of some men to violate the rights of others.Yet the entire policy of the Negro leaders is now moving in that direction. Forinstance, the demand for racial quotas in schools, with the proposal thathundreds of children, white and Negro, be forced to attend school in distantneighborhoods—for the purpose of “racial balance.” Again, this is pure racism.As opponents of this demand have pointed out, to assign children to certainschools by reason of their race, is equally evil whether one does it forpurposes of segregation or integration. And the mere idea of using children aspawns in a political game should outrage all parents, of any race, creed orcolor.The “civil rights” bill, now under consideration in Congress, is another exampleof a gross infringement of individual rights. It is proper to forbid alldiscrimination in government-owned facilities and establishments: the governmenthas no right to discriminate against any citizens. And by the very sameprinciple, the government has no right to discriminate for some citizens at theexpense of others. It has no right to violate the right of private property byforbidding discrimination in privately owned establishments.No man, neither Negro nor white, has any claim to the property of another man. Aman’s rights are not violated by a private individual’s refusal to deal withhim. Racism is an evil, irrational and morally contemptible doctrine—butdoctrines cannot be forbidden or prescribed by law. Just as we have to protect acommunist’s freedom of speech, even though his doctrines are evil, so we have toprotect a racist’s right to the use and disposal of his own property. Privateracism is not a legal, but a moral issue—and can be fought only by privatemeans, such as economic boycott or social ostracism.Needless to say, if that “civil rights” bill is passed, it will be the worstbreach of property rights in the sorry record of American history in respect tothat subject.b [rand_9781101137277_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2]It is an ironic demonstration of the philosophical insanity and the consequentlysuicidal trend of our age, that the men who need the protection of individualrights most urgently—the Negroes—are now in the vanguard of the destruction ofthese rights.A word of warning: do not become victims of the same racists by succumbing toracism; do not hold against all Negroes the disgraceful irrationality of some oftheir leaders. No group has any proper intellectual leadership today or anyproper representation.In conclusion, I shall quote from an astonishing editorial in The New York Timesof August 4—astonishing because ideas of this nature are not typical of our age:“But the question must be not whether a group recognizable in color, features orculture has its rights as a group. No, the question is whether any Americanindividual, regardless of color, features or culture, is deprived of his rightsas an American. If the individual has all the rights and privileges due himunder the laws and the Constitution, we need not worry about groups andmasses—those do not, in fact, exist, except as figures of speech.” (September 1963)"},{"pageContent":"Global BalkanizationHave you ever wondered about the process of the collapse of a civilization? Notthe cause of the collapse -the ultimate cause is always philosophical—but theprocess, the specific means by which the accumulated knowledge and achievementsof centuries vanish from the earth?The possibility of the collapse of Western civilization is not easy to imagineor to believe. Most people do not quite believe it—in spite of all the horrormovies about the end of the world in a nuclear blast. But of course the worldhas never been destroyed by a sudden catastrophe. Man-made catastrophes of thatsize are not sudden; they are the result of a long, slow, gradual process, whichcan be observed in advance.Let me remind you—as I have said many times before—that there is no such thingas historical determinism. The world does not have to continue moving towarddisaster. But unless men change their philosophical direction—which they stillhave time to do—the collapse will come. And if you want to know the specificprocess that will bring it about, that process—the beginning of the end—isvisible today.In The New York Times of January 18, 1976, under the title “Europe’s RestiveTribes,” columnist C. L. Sulzberger is crying out in anxious bewildermentagainst a phenomenon he cannot understand: “It is distressing to return fromAfrica and find the cultivated old continent of Europe subsiding into its ownform of tribalism just as new African governments make concerted effortsThis lecture was delivered at the Ford Hall Forum on April 10. 1977.to curb the power of tribes and subordinate them to the greater concept of thenation-state.,”By “tribalism,” Mr. Sulzberger means the separatist movements spreadingthroughout Europe. “Indeed,” he declares,it is a peculiar phenomenon of contemporary times that so many lands which hadformerly been powerful and important seem obsessed with reducing the remnants oftheir own strength.... There is no logical reason that a Scotland which wasproud to be considered part of the British Empire’s heart when the sun never seton it, from Calcutta to Capetown, is now increasingly eager to disengage fromwhat is left of that grand tradition on an offshore European island. [Emphasisadded.]Oh yes, there is a very logical reason why Great Britain is falling apart, butMr. Sulzberger does not see it—just as he does not see what was grand about thatold tradition. He is the Times’ columnist specializing in European affairs, and,like a conscientious reporter, he is disturbed by something which he senses tobe profoundly wrong—but, tending to be a liberal, he is unable to explain it.He keeps coming back to the subject again and again. On July 3, 1976, in acolumn entitled “The Split Nationality Syndrome,” he writes: “The present era’smost paradoxical feature is the conflict between movements seeking to unifygreat geographical blocs into federations or confederations, and movementsseeking to disintegrate into still smaller pieces the component nations tryingto get together.”He offers an impressive list of examples. In France there is a Corsican autonomymovement, and similar movements of French Basques, of French Bretons, and ofFrench inhabitants of the Jura belt west of Switzerland. “Britain is nowobsessed with what is awkwardly called ‘devolution.’ This means watered-downautonomy and is designed to satisfy Welsh, but above all Scottish,nationalists.” Belgium remains split “by an apparently insoluble languagedispute between French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemish.” Spain isfacing demands for local independence “in Catalonia and the northern Basquecountry.... German-speaking inhabitants of Italy’s Alto Adige yearn to leaveRome and submit to Vienna. There is a tiny British-Danish argument ... over thestatus of the Faroe Islanders.... In Yugoslavia there are continuing disputesbetween Serbs and Croats ... There is also unresolved ferment among Macedonians. . . some of whom, on occasion, revive old dreams of their own state includingGreek Salonika and part of Bulgaria.”Please remember that these tribes and subtribes, which most of the world hasnever heard of—since they have achieved no distinction to hear about—arestruggling to secede from whatever country they are in and to form their ownseparate, sovereign, independent nations on their two-by-four stretches of theearth’s crust.I must make one correction. These tribes did achieve a certain kind ofdistinction: a history of endless, bloody warfare.Coming back to Mr. Sulzberger: Africa, he points out, is torn apart by tribalism(in spite of the local governments’ efforts), and most of Africa’s recent warswere derived “from tribal causes.” He concludes by observing: “The schizophrenicimpulses splitting Europe threaten actually to atomize Africa—and all in thename of progress and unity.”In a column entitled “Western Schizophrenia” (December 22, 1976), Mr. Sulzbergercries: “The West is not drawing closer together; it is coming apart. This isless complicated but perhaps more distressing in North America than in Europe.”For myself, I will add: and more disgusting.Mr. Sulzberger continues: “Canada is apparently getting ready to tear itselfasunder for emotional if illogical reasons which, on a massive scale, resemblethe language dispute that continually splits Belgium ...” He predicts thepossibility of a formal separation between French-speaking Quebec and the restof Canada, and comments sadly and helplessly: “Whatever happens, it is hard toforesee much good for the West ensuing.” Which is certainly true.Now what are the nature and the causes of modern tribalism?Philosophically, tribalism is the product of irrationalism and collectivism. Itis a logical consequence of modern philosophy. If men accept the notion thatreason is not valid, what is to guide them and how are they to live? Obviously,they will seek to join some group—any group—which claims the ability to leadthem and to provide some sort of knowledge acquired by some sort of unspecifiedmeans. If men accept the notion that the individual is helpless, intellectuallyand morally, that he has no mind and no rights, that he is nothing, but thegroup is all, and his only moral significance lies in selfless service to thegroup—they will be pulled obediently to join a group. But which group? Well, ifyou believe that you have no mind and no moral value, you cannot have theconfidence to make choices—so the only thing for you to do is to join anunchosen group, the group into which you were born, the group to which you werepredestined to belong by the sovereign, omnipotent, omniscient power of yourbody chemistry.This, of course, is racism. But if your group is small enough, it will not becalled “racism”: it will be called “ethnicity.”For over half a century, modern liberals have been observing the fact that theirideas are achieving the opposite of their professed goals: instead of“liberation,” communism has brought the blood-drenched dictatorship of SovietRussia—instead of “prosperity,” socialism has brought starvation to China, andCuba, and India (and Russia)—instead of “brotherhood,” the welfare state hasbrought the crumbling stagnation and the fierce, “elitist” power struggle ofGreat Britain, and Sweden, and many other, less obvious victims—instead of“peace,” the spread of international altruism has brought about two world wars,an unceasing procession of local wars, and the suspending of a nuclear bomb overthe heads of mankind. Yet this record does not prompt the liberals to checktheir premises or to glance, for contrast, at the record of the social systemthe last remnants of which they are so ferociously destroying.Now we are seeing another demonstration of the fact that their professed goalsare not the motive of today’s liberals. We are seeing a special kind ofintellectual cover-up—a cover-up so dirty and so low that it makes Watergatelook like a childish caper.Observe that ever since World War 11, racism has been regarded as a viciousfalsehood and a great evil, which it certainly is. It is not the root of allsocial evils——the root is collectivism——but, as I have written before (in TheVirtue of Selfishness), “Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form ofcollectivism.” One would think that Hitler had given a sufficient demonstrationof racism’s evil. Yet today’s intellectuals, particularly the liberals, aresupporting and propagating the most virulent form of racism on earth: tribalism.The cover-up that makes it possible lies in a single word: ethnicity.“Ethnicity” is an anti-concept, used as a disguise for the word “racism” and ithas no clearly definable meaning. But you can get a lead to its meaning if youhunt through a dictionary. The following are the results of my hunt through TheRandom House College Dictionary (1960), a book intended for young people.I found no such term as “ethnicity.” But I found “ethnic,” which is defined asfollows: “pertaining or peculiar to a population, esp. to a speech group,loosely also to a race.” Under “ethnic group,” the definition given associological usage reads: “a group of people, racially or historically related,having a common and distinctive culture, as an Italian or Chinese colony in alarge American city.”I looked up the word “culture.” The definition given as sociological usagereads: “the sum total of ways of living built up by a group of human beings,which is transmitted from one generation to another.” I looked up also the word“tribe.” The definition reads: “1. any aggregate of people united by ties ofdescent from a common ancestor, community of customs, and traditions, adherenceto the same leaders, etc. 2. a local division of a primitive or barbarouspeople”The meaning of the sum of these definitions is fairly clear: the term“ethnicity” stresses the traditional, rather than the physiologicalcharacteristics of a group, such as language—but physiology, i.e., race, isinvolved and mentioned in all but one of these definitions. So the advocacy of“ethnicity,” means racism plus tradition i.e., racism plus conformity i.e.,racism plus staleness.The acceptance of the achievements of an individual by other individuals doesnot represent “ethnicity”: it represents a cultural division of labor in a freemarket; it represents a conscious, individual choice on the part of all the meninvolved; the achievements may be scientific or technological or industrial orintellectual or esthetic—and the sum of such accepted achievements constitutes afree, civilized nation’s culture. Tradition has nothing to do with it; traditionis being challenged and blasted daily in a free, civilized society: its citizensaccept ideas and products because they are true and/or good—not because they areold or because their ancestors accepted them. In such a society, concreteschange, but what remains immutable—by individual conviction, not bytradition—are those philosophical principles which correspond to reality, i.e.,which are true.The “old” and the “ancestral” are the standards of tradition, which supersedesreality, the standards of value of those who accept and practice “ethnicity.”Culture, in the modern sociologists’ view, is not a sum of achievements, but of“ways of living . . . transmitted from one generation to another.” This means:concrete, specific ways of living. Can you—who are still the children of theUnited States of America—imagine the utter horror of a way of living that doesnot change from generation to generation? Yet this is what the advocates ofethnicity are advocating.Is such a way of living compatible with reason? It is not. Is it compatible withindependence or individuality? It is not. Is it compatible with progress?Obviously not. Is it compatible with capitalism? Don’t be funny. What centuryare we talking about? We are dealing with a phenomenon that is rising out ofprehistorical ages.Atavistic remnants and echoes of those ages have always existed in thebackwaters of civilized countries, particularly in Europe, among the old, thetired, the timid, and those who gave up before they started. Such people are thecarriers of “ethnicity.” The “ways of living” they transmit from generation togeneration consist in: folk songs, folk dances, special ways of cooking food,traditional costumes, and folk festivals. Although the professional “ethnics”would (and did) fight wars over the differences between their songs and those oftheir neighbors, there are no significant differences between them; all folk artis essentially similar and excruciatingly boring: if you’ve seen one set ofpeople clapping their hands while jumping up and down, you’ve seen them all.Now observe the nature of those traditional ethnic “achievements” : all of thembelong to the perceptual level of man’s consciousness. All of them are ways ofdealing with or manipulating the concrete, the immediately given, the directlyperceivable. All of them are manifestations of the preconceptual stage of humandevelopment.I quote from one of my articles: “The concrete-bound, anti-conceptual mentalitycan cope only with men who are bound by the same concretes—by the same kind of‘finite’ world. To this mentality, it means a world in which men do not have todeal with abstract principles: principles are replaced by memorized rules ofbehavior, which are accepted uncritically as the given. What is ‘finite’ in sucha world is not its extension, but the degree of mental effort required of itsinhabitants. When they say ‘finite,’ they mean ‘perceptual.’ ” (This is from“The Missing Link” in [Philosophy: Who Needs It]. That article deals with thepsycho-epistemological roots of modern tribalism.)In the same article I said: “John Dewey’s theory of Progressive education (whichhas dominated the schools for close to half a century), established a method ofcrippling a child’s conceptual faculty and replacing cognition with ‘socialadjustment.’ It was and is a systematic attempt to manufacture tribalmentalities.”A symptom of the tribal mentality’s self-arrested, perceptual level ofdevelopment may be observed in the tribalists’ position on language.Language is a conceptual toot—a code of visual-auditory symbols that denoteconcepts. To a person who understands the function of language, it makes nodifference what sounds are chosen to name things, provided these sounds refer toclearly defined aspects of reality. But to a tribalist, language is a mysticheritage, a string of sounds handed down from his ancestors and memorized, notunderstood. To him the importance lies in the perceptual concrete, the sound ofa word, not its meaning. He would kill and die for the privilege of printing onevery postage stamp the word “postage” for the English-speaking and the word“postes” for the French-speaking citizens of his bilingual Canada. Since most ofthe ethnic languages are not full languages, but merely dialects or localcorruptions of a country’s language, the distinctions which the tribalists fightfor are not even as big as that.But, of course, it is not for their language that the tribalists are fighting:they are fighting to protect their level of awareness, their mental passivity,their obedience to the tribe, and their desire to ignore the existence ofoutsiders.The learning of another language expands one’s abstract capacity and vision.Personally, I speak four—or rather three-and-a-half—languages: English, French,Russian, and the half is German, which I can read but not speak. I found thisknowledge extremely helpful when I began writing: it gave me a wider range andchoice of concepts; it showed me four different styles of expression; it made megrasp the nature of languages as such, apart from any set of concretes.(Speaking of concretes, I would say that every civilized language has its owninimitable power and beauty, but the one I love is English—the language of mychoice, not of my birth. English is the most eloquent, the most precise, themost economical, and, therefore, the most powerful. English fits me best—but Iwould be able to express my identity in any Western language.)The tribalists clamor that their language preserves their “ethnic identity.” Butthere is no such thing. Conformity to a racist tradition does not constitute ahuman identity. Just as racism provides a pseudo-self-esteem for men who havenot earned an authentic one, so their hysterical loyalty to their own dialectserves a similar function: it provides a pretense at “collective self-esteem,”an illusion of safety for the confused, frightened, precarious state of atribalist’s stagnant consciousness.The proclaimed desire to preserve one’s language and/or its literary works, ifany, is a cover-up. In a free, or even semi-free country, no one is forbidden tospeak any language he chooses with those who wish to speak it. But he cannotforce it on others. A country has to have only one official language if men areto understand one another—and it makes no difference which language it is, sincemen live by the meaning, not the sound, of words. It is eminently fair that acountry’s official language should be the language of the majority. As toliterary works, their survival does not depend on political enforcement.But to the tribalists, language is not a tool of thought and communication.Language to them is a symbol of tribal status and power—the power to force theirdialect on all outsiders. This appeals not even to the tribal leaders, but tothe sick, touchy vanity of the tribal rank and file.In this connection, I want to mention a hypothesis of mine, which is only ahypothesis because I have given no special study to the subject of bilingualcountries, i.e., countries that have two official languages. But I have observedthe fact that bilingual countries tend to be culturally impoverished bycomparison to the major countries whose language they share in part. Bilingualcountries do not produce many great, first-rate achievements in any intellectualline of endeavor, whether in science, philosophy, literature, or art. Considerthe record of Belgium (which is French-speaking in part) as against the recordof France—or the record of Switzerland (a trilingual country) as against therecord of France, of Germany, of Italy—or the record of Canada as against therecord of the United States.The cause of the poor records may lie in the comparative territorial smallnessof those countries—but this does not apply to Canada versus the United States.The cause may lie in the fact that the best, most talented citizens of thebilingual countries tend to emigrate to the major countries—but this stillleaves the question: Why do they?My hypothesis is as follows: the policy of bilingual rule (which spares somecitizens the necessity to learn another language) is a concession to, and aperpetuation of, a strong ethnic-tribalist element within a country. It is anelement of anti-intellectuality, conformity, and stagnation. The best mindswould run from such countries: they would sense, if not know it consciously,that tribalism leaves them no chance.But quite apart from this particular hypothesis, there can be no doubt that thespread of tribalism is an enormously anti-intellectual evil. If, as I said, someelements of “ethnicity” did remain in the backyards of civilized countries andstayed harmless for centuries, why the sudden epidemic of their rebirth?Irrationalism and collectivism the philosophical notions of the prehistoricaleras—had to be implemented in practice, in political action, before they couldengulf the greatest scientific-technological achievements mankind had everreached. The political cause of tribalism’s rebirth is the mixed economy—thetransitional stage of the formerly civilized countries of the West on their wayto the political level from which the rest of the world has never emerged: thelevel of permanent tribal warfare.As I wrote in my article on “Racism” (in The Virtue of Selfishness): “The growthof racism in a ‘mixed economy’ keeps step with the growth of governmentcontrols. A ‘mixed economy’ disintegrates a country into an institutionalizedcivil war of pressure groups, each fighting for legislative favors and specialprivileges at the expense of one another.”When a country begins to use such expressions as “seeking a bigger share of thepie,” it is accepting a tenet of pure collectivism : the notion that the goodsproduced in a country do not belong to the producers, but belong to everybody,and that the government is the distributor. If so, what chance does anindividual have of getting a slice of that pie? No chance at all, not even a fewcrumbs. An individual becomes “fair game” for every sort of organized predator.Thus people are pushed to surrender their independence in exchange for tribalprotection.The government of a mixed economy manufactures pressure groups—and,specifically, manufactures “ethnicity.” The profiteers are those group leaderswho discover suddenly that they can exploit the helplessness, the fear, thefrustration of their “ethnic” brothers, organize them into a group, presentdemands to the government—and deliver the vote. The result is political jobs,subsidies, influence, and prestige for the leaders of the ethnic groups.This does not improve the lot of the group’s rank and file. It makes nodifference to the hard-pressed unemployed of any race or color what quota ofjobs, college admissions, and Washington appointments were handed out to thepolitical manipulators from their particular race or color. But the ugly farcegoes on, with the help and approval of the intellectuals, who write about“minority victories.”Here is a sample of the goal of such victories. In The New York Times of January17, 1977, a news story was headlined as follows: “Hispanic Groups Say They AreInequitably Treated in Support for Arts.” At a hearing on the subject, New YorkState Senator Robert Garcia declared: “What we are really talking about isdollars and whether we are receiving a fair share of the revenues generated inthis state.” The purpose of the demands for state dollars was “to assure thegrowth of ‘non-mainstream art forms.’ ” This means: art forms which people donot care to see or to support. The recommendations reached at the hearingincluded the demand that “at least twenty-five percent of the money goes toHispanic arts.”This, ladies and gentlemen, is what your tax money is being spent on: the newprofiteers of altruism are not the poor, the sick, or the unemployed, but ethnicfemales swishing their skirts in old Spanish dances which were not too good evenwhen they were new.This is a typical example of the motives and the vested interests behind thegrowth, the pushing, and the touting of “ethnicity.”An interesting article was published in the British magazine Encounter (February1975). It is entitled “The Universalisation of Ethnicity” and is written byNathan Glazer, a well-known American sociologist. It is quite revealing of themodern intellectuals’ attitude toward the spread of ethnicity more revealing inwhat Mr. Glazer does not say than in what he does.He observes: “The overwhelming majority of people ... are born into a religion,rather than adopt it, just as they are born into an ethnic group. In thisrespect both are similar. They are both groups by ‘ascription’ rather than‘achievement.’ They are groups in which one’s status is immediately given bybirth rather than gained by some activities in one’s life.”This is eminently—and horribly—true. There is a great deal to be said about thehorrifying approach of a world dominated by people who prefer “ascription” to“achievement,” and who seek a physiologically determined, automatically givenstatus rather than a status they have to earn. Mr. Glazer does not say it; hemerely reports.He is disturbed by the relationship of “ethnic group” to “caste,” but treats itmerely as a problem of definitions. But, of course, castes are inherent in thenotion of ethnicity—castes of superiors and inferiors, determined by birth,enforced and perpetuated by law, dividing people into “aristocrats,”“commoners,” etc., down to “untouchables.”Mr. Glazer makes a true and profoundly important statement: “The United Statesis perhaps unique among the states of the world in using the term ‘nation’ torefer not to an ethnic group but to all who choose to become Americans.” But hedraws no conclusions from it. Yet it is extremely significant that the UnitedStates was the archenemy and the destroyer of ethnicity, that it abolishedcastes and any sort of inherited titles, that it granted no recognition togroups as such, that it recognized only the right of the individual to choosethe associations he wished to join. Freedom of association is the opposite ofethnicity.Mr. Glazer does not raise the question of the original American philosophy andthe relationship of its destruction to the rise of ethnicity. The focus of hisinterest lies elsewhere. He writes: “The Socialist hope for a trans-nationalclass struggle, based on class identification, never came to pass. Instead, ithas been replaced by national and ethnic conflicts.” And: “In most countriesnational interests and ethnic interests seem to dominate over class interests.”Mr. Glazer is baffled by this development. He offers some tentative explanationswith which he himself is not satisfied, such as: “The trends of modernisation,even while they do destroy some bases of distinctive culture and distinctiveidentity, create a need for a new kind of identity related to the old, intimatetype of village or tribal association.” A modern, technological society, whichincludes nuclear bombs and space travel—to be run by villages or by tribalassociations?Mr. Glazer himself tends to dismiss theories of this sort, and admits that hecannot find an explanation. “This is the heart of the darkness. Why didn’t themajor lines of conflict within societies become class conflicts rather thanethnic conflicts? ... In most developing countries Marxism remains the ideologyof the students and often of the ruling group—but ethnicity is the focus aroundwhich identity and loyalty have been shaped.” Mr. Glazer comes closer to ananswer when he observes that ethnicity has “an irrational appeal,” but he takesit no further. He says instead:It would seem that the rallying cries that mobilise the classes have, in recentdecades, had less power than the rallying cries that mobilise the races, tribes,religions, language-users—in short, the Ethnic Groups. Perhaps the epidemic ofethnic conflicts reflects the fact that leaders and organisers believe they canget a more potent response by appealing to ethnicity than they can by appealingto Class Interest.True, leaders and organizers do believe this—but why? The answer to Mr. Glazer’squestions lies in the fact that Marxism is an intellectual construct; it isfalse, but it is an abstract theory—and it is too abstract for the tribalists’concrete-bound, perceptual mentalities. It requires a significantly high levelof abstraction to grasp the reality of “an international working class”—a levelbeyond the power of a consciousness that understands its own village, but hastrouble treating the nearest town as fully real. No, the level of men’sintelligence has not deteriorated from natural causes; it has been pushed down,retarded, stultified by modern anti-intellectual education and modernirrationalist philosophy.Mr. Glazer does not see or is not concerned with any part of this answer. It isobvious that he is disturbed by the spread of ethnicity, but he tries to hopefor the best—and this leads him, in conclusion, to a truly unspeakablestatement. After proposing some sort of solution in the form of “eitherguaranteed shares for each group, or guaranteed rights for each individual andeach group,” he continues: “The United States in the past seemed to find theapproach in terms of ‘guaranteed rights’ more congenial than the approach interms of guaranteed shares; but recently Americans have begun to take individualrights less seriously, and to take group shares more seriously.” After Irecovered from feeling sick at my stomach, I asked myself: What Americans hasMr. Glazer been observing or associating with? I do not know—but his statementis libel against an entire nation. His statement means that Americans arewilling to sell their rights for money—for a “share of the pie.”In his last paragraph Mr. Glazer observes that there was time when “the problemsof Ethnicity, as a source of conflict within nations and between nations, havegenerally appeared as simply a left-over, an embarrassment from the past. It ismy conviction they must now be placed at the very centre of our concern for thehuman condition.”He is right to fear such a prospect.There is no surer way to infect mankind with hatred—brute, blind, virulenthatred—than by splitting it into ethnic groups or tribes. If a man believes thathis own character is determined at birth in some unknown, ineffable way, andthat the characters of all strangers are determined in the same way—then nocommunication, no understanding, no persuasion is possible among them, onlymutual fear, suspicion, and hatred. Tribal or ethnic rule has existed, at sometime, in every part of the world, and, in some country, in every period ofmankind’s history. The record of hatred is always the same. The worst kinds ofatrocities were perpetrated during ethnic (including religious) wars. A recentgrand-scale example of it was Nazi Germany.Warfare permanent warfare—is the hallmark of tribal existence. A tribe—with itsrules, dogmas, traditions, and arrested mental development—is not a productiveorganization. Tribes subsist on the edge of starvation, at the mercy of naturaldisasters, less successfully than herds of animals. War against other,momentarily luckier tribes, in the hope of looting some meager hoard, is theirchronic emergency means of survival. The inculcation of hatred for other tribesis a necessary tool of tribal rulers, who need scapegoats to blame for themisery of their own subjects.There is no tyranny worse than ethnic rule—since it is an unchosen serfdom oneis asked to accept as a value, and since it applies primarily to one’s mind. Aman of self-esteem will not accept the notion that the content of his mind isdetermined by his muscles, i.e., by his own body. But by the bodies of anunspecified string of ancestors? Determinism by the means of production ispreferable; it is equally false, but less offensive to human dignity. Marxism iscorrupt, but clean compared to the stale, rank, musty odor of ethnicity.As to the stagnation under tribal rule—take a look at the Balkans. At the startof this century, the Balkans were regarded as the disgrace of Europe. Six oreight tribes, plus a number of subtribes with unpronounceable names, werecrowded on the Balkan peninsula, engaging in endless wars among themselves orbeing conquered by stronger neighbors or practicing violence for the sake ofviolence over some microscopic language differences. “Balkanization”—the breakupof larger nations into ethnic tribes—was used as a pejorative term by theEuropean intellectuals of the time. Those same intellectuals were patheticallyproud when they managed, after World War I, to glue most of the Balkan tribestogether into two larger countries: Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. But thetribes never vanished; they have been popping up in minor explosions all along,and a major one is possible at any time.In the light of tribalism’s historical record, it is ludicrous to compromisewith it, to hope for the best or to expect some sort of fair “group shares.”Nothing can be expected from tribalism except brutality and war. But this time,it is not with bows and arrows that the tribes will be armed, but with nuclearbombs.As a tiny preview of what tribalism would mean in a modern, technologicalcivilization, a story in The New York Times of January 23, 1977, reports thatthe French-speaking Canadians of Quebec had demanded the use of French in allofficial dealings, including at airports, but “a federal court upheld a ban bythe federal Ministry of Transport on the use of French for landings atMontreal’s two international airports. (English is the language accepted atairports in every nation of the world.)”Let me remind you of the recent terrible collision of two planes in the CanaryIslands. Although all the personnel involved spoke English perfectly, theinvestigations seem to indicate that the collision was caused by linguisticmisunderstandings. But what is that to the Canadians of Quebec, or to Idi Aminof Uganda, or to any other ethnic tribalists who might demand that theirlanguage be spoken by every plane pilot in the world? Incidentally, thatcollision took place because the small airport was overcrowded with planes thatcould not land at a nearby major airport: the major airport had been bombed byethnic terrorists who were seeking the independence of the Canary Islands fromSpain.How long would the achievements of a technological civilization last under thissort of tribal management?Some people ask whether local groups or provinces have the right to secede fromthe country of which they are a part. The answer is: on ethnic grounds, no.Ethnicity is not a valid consideration, morally or politically, and does notendow anyone with any special rights. As to other than ethnic grounds, rememberthat rights belong only to individuals and that there is no such thing as “grouprights.” If a province wants to secede from a dictatorship, or even from a mixedeconomy, in order to establish a free country—it has the right to do so. But ifa local gang, ethnic or otherwise, wants to secede in order to establish its owngovernment controls, it does not have that right. No group has the right toviolate the rights of the individuals who happen to live in the same locality. Awish—individual or collective—is not a right.Is there a way to avoid the rebirth of global tribalism and the approach ofanother Dark Ages? Yes, there is, but only one way—through the rebirth of theantagonist that has demonstrated its power to relegate ethnicity to a peacefuldump: capitalism.Observe the paradoxes built up about capitalism. It has been called a system ofselfishness (which, in my sense of the term, it is)—yet it is the only systemthat drew men to unite on a large scale into great countries, and peacefully tocooperate across national boundaries, while all the collectivist,internationalist, One-World systems are splitting the world into Balkanizedtribes.Capitalism has been called a system of greed—yet it is the system that raisedthe standard of living of its poorest citizens to heights no collectivist systemhas ever begun to equal, and no tribal gang can conceive of.Capitalism has been called nationalistic—yet it is the only system that banishedethnicity, and made it possible, in the United States, for men of various,formerly antagonistic nationalities to live together in peace.Capitalism has been called cruel—yet it brought such hope, progress and generalgood will that the young people of today, who have not seen it, find it hard tobelieve.As to pride, dignity, self-confidence, self-esteem—these are characteristicsthat mark a man for martyrdom in a tribal society and under any social systemexcept capitalism.If you want an example of what had once been the spirit of America—a spiritwhich would be impossible today, but which we must now struggle to bring to arebirth I will quote from an old poem that represents the opposite of the abjectself-abasement of ethnicity. It is a poem called “The Westerner” by BadgerClark.He begins with “My fathers sleep on the Eastern plain and each one sleepsalone”—he acknowledges his respect for his forefathers, then says:But I lean on no dead kin.My name is mine for fame or scorn,And the world began when I was born,And the world is mine to win."},{"pageContent":"Gender TribalismPeter SchwartzAll forms of collectivism rest on a certain metaphysics. The collectivisttenets—in economics, that production is primarily a social effort; in politics,that the group, not the individual, has rights; in ethics, that the individualmust sacrifice his interests to the needs of society; in epistemology, that thejudgment of an individual mind is subordinate to the collective consensus—allstem from a deeper premise: that the individual is impotent to cope withreality. The individual, on this premise, cannot sustain his life on his own,and must depend upon the group for survival.This viewpoint, as applied to women, is what feminism essentially promulgates.Of all the supposedly demeaning views of women for which feminists condemn our“patriarchal” society, none is remotely as denigrating as that held by feminismitself. It is, today, uniquely feminists who depict women as congenitallyhelpless, endlessly “victimized” creatures.It is feminists who declare that, without government aid, women are compelled toaccept only 75 percent of what men are paid—that their advancement at work isblocked by a “glass ceiling,” which only the weight of government canshatter—that women cannot be expected to hold full-time jobs unless governmentprovides day-care services for their children—that women cannot get hired forthe better jobs or admitted into the better schools, except through“affirmative-action” preferences—that women cannot attain self-esteem as long asPlayboy-type material (which, a court rules, has “a negative impact on theindividual’s sense of self-worth and acceptance”) is legally permitted to besold.1 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en1]The message of such feminist stands is that the individual woman cannot succeedin life by her own efforts and on her own merit. She is at the mercy of forcesshe cannot control, unable to obtain work, education or self-respect without thesuccor of a (governmental) nursemaid.This is not merely a journalistic description of what feminists see as anunfortunate condition of women at present. This is, rather, a part of theirbasic philosophy—a philosophy that holds metaphysical powerlessness to bewoman’s normal state.And it is a state that feminists actively foster. They want women to believethat the way to attain one’s goals is to rely, not on individual merit, but onthe power of the group. According to feminism, acquiring the specific abilitiesnecessary for success in some area should be of little concern to women. Infact, they should dismiss the very need for such abilities. What they shouldcount on, instead, is the fact of their gender.For example, the average woman scores lower on the Medical College AdmissionsTest (because of deficiencies in her knowledge of science) than the average man.Should women who want to be doctors come to the logical conclusion that theyneed to study harder? Should women be advised to master science, so that theycan be accepted on the same basis as men, irrespective of gender? No, say thefeminists; the only conclusion to be drawn is that not enough women are beingadmitted—so the qualifications must be changed.2[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en2]If a woman wants to be, say, a firefighter, the feminists do not encourage herto make sure she measures up to the demanding physical standards. What mattersmost, she is told, is that there be a representative contingent of her gender atthe firehouse. And if she does not meet the standards? She should not have to,feminists retort; women are rightly due their quota of such jobs.With all their prattle about female “empowerment,” feminists disavow the onlylegitimate meaning of that term: i.e., the individual woman’s self-created powerto make herself into a value, the power to make an employer want to promote heror a school want to enroll her—as a mutually beneficial exchange, based on herobjective ability, not as a sacrificial accommodation to her gender. But thatwould be too independent an approach for the feminists to sanction.Their implicit message to women is: “You cannot succeed on your own—but youdon’t have to; your collective will get you what you want.”Ironically, when the contemporary feminist movement began, in the 1960s, peoplebelieved that its message was the exact opposite. They believed that women werebeing urged to abandon the traditional “hausfrau” mentality—i.e., the assumption(held by females no less than by males) that women were incapable of dealingwith existence outside the confines of the kitchen and the bedroom. Peoplebelieved that women were being urged to seek their own careers, to rejectunchosen duties to others, to assert a moral right to the pursuit of their ownhappiness, to embrace the real world by becoming airline pilots, neurosurgeons,music composers and CEOs.But the collectivism at the heart of the movement quickly surfaced, revealingfeminism’s true nature. It became clear that women were expected to obtain allthese new positions, not by earning them qua individuals, but by demanding themqua females. It became clear that the hausfrau image, far from being rejected,was being endorsed by feminism—in an updated, uglier form.Whereas the old hausfrau mentality said that women could not perform the moredemanding jobs as competently as men, this same mentality now says that womenshould not be required to. Now, the fact of gender supposedly entitles women totheir “fair share” of corporate vice presidencies, irrespective of ability. Now,under this “neo-hausfrauism,” women don’t have to earn any reward—they just haveto call upon Momma State to grab it for them. Now, as before, the conclusion forwomen is: gender determines all.It is only the perverse influence of modern collectivism that permits such moraldebilitation to be termed “liberation.”In pushing this philosophy, feminism attracts the very worst among women. Itdraws all those who want to be absolved of responsibility for their lives. Everyhousewife who feels guilty for having forever given up her pursuit of acareer——every mindless scrub nurse who regrets having abandoned her ambition forsomething more—every bitter woman in a dead-end job or a dead-end life——are allreassured that their plight is not their fault. The individual woman cannotsucceed—feminist doctrine proclaims; so she is not to be reproached for herfailures.One type of woman, however, is to be reproached: the woman of true independence.The woman who wants to judge and be judged according to individual merit—whoscorns the crutch of “affirmative action,” who succeeds on her own and who isproud of it—is chastised as a traitor to her tribe. She would never haveachieved anything—feminists resentfully insist—had it not been for thecollective efforts of all women.Feminism rests upon dependency. It tenaciously recruits—and molds——dependent,self-abnegating women. It inculcates in them a belief in their metaphysicalhelplessness—and then waits for them to become docile members of the flock.Feminism wants to enshrine the very mentality from which it claims to “liberate”women. It seeks to re-channel the hausfrau mentality—the desire to be providedfor—by simply switching the object of dependence from husbands to the“Sisterhood.”The leaders of feminism advocate the creed of the social worker. The socialworker exists, not to help people escape from trouble, but to persuade them thatlife inherently is trouble——from which escape is impossible without the help ofthe social worker. Feminists want to instill a similar state of mind, byconvincing the individual woman that she is doomed to frustration andfailure—unless she hitches her wagon to the collective caravan of womanhood. At the root of this malign conception of women lies a premise about free will.Feminists implicitly believe that women have no genuine volition and that theirchoices in life are not freely made.Thus, according to feminism, a woman is never to feel guilty, no matter how lowshe may have sunk. Has she thrown her life away in a loveless marriage, in drugaddiction, in prostitution, in violent crime? She could not help it, feministstell her. Her choices are not the cause of her misery. Society did not allow herto do anything else. It is society, not she, that needs changing. And the onlytrue “choice” a woman can make, therefore, is a collective one: to stand insolidarity with her female comrades.The heroines of the feminist movement are not the women who achieve productivelives by their own efforts, but those who announce how empty and impossibletheir lives would have been without the maternalistic aid of afeminist-sensitive state. The woman who has no real self to assert—who pleads tobe taken care of by her “sisters”—who preaches loyalty to quotas andsubservience to the collective—who declares that the source of her unhappinessis not her own irrational choices in life but a tyrannical culture—it is she whois held up as a model to be emulated.Because feminism regards volition as a myth, women are consistently portrayed asvictims. Since they are not held responsible for any failure to attain some end,every frustrated whim of theirs is taken as a sign of victimization. It is takenas evidence that women are being denied their rightful share of the goods.“Feminist consciousness”—says one author—“is consciousness of victimization. ”3[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en3] (Emphasis in original.)The actual “victimizer” is, of course, reality itself. If a woman wants to behired for a certain position or to gain entry into a certain school, not becauseshe qualifies for it, but because she belongs to a class whose desires are notbeing fulfilled—then it is reality that is the barrier. For it is reality thatdemands objective qualifications. It is reality that presents us with theunbending law of causality, the law which states that a job can be done only bythose who can do it. It is objectivity—the need to adhere to the requirements ofreality—that is feminism’s real enemy.But feminists dismiss the very concept of an objective reality, because thevolitionless woman cannot survive in such a world. She cannot accommodateherself to a universe that makes such rigid demands upon her. She wants the“flexibility” of the non-objective. She feels ineffectual in an objectivereality—so feminism repudiates it for her.“Feminist analysis”—says a professor at the University of New Mexico LawSchool—“begins and ends with the principle that objective reality is a myth.”4[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en4]Thus feminists denounce the “exclusionary” means by which society evaluatesdoctors, lawyers, soldiers. Why, they ask, should women be judged by objectivestandards? And if one answers: because reality and reason mandate it—their replyis: Why should women be bound by reality and reason? Why can’t a woman beallowed to construct a more malleable world, a world she feels is morehospitable to her wishes? Why shouldn’t she be judged, for example, by hercompassion for the ill, rather than her ability to perform surgery—or by heraptitude for telling stories rather than for logically analyzing legalprinciples—or by her capacity to bond with her fellow soldiers rather than torun an obstacle course in full military gear?As the president of City College of New York, complaining about a lack of“diversity” in universities, writes: “Institutions of higher learning in theUnited States are products of Western society in which masculine values like anorientation toward achievement and objectivity are valued over cooperation,connectedness and subjectivity.”5 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en5]Why, feminists wonder, should even immutable facts stand in the way of women’segalitarian desires? For instance, why should women pay more for annuities justbecause they have longer life expectancies? Why should they pay differentmedical insurance premiums just because they incur pregnancy-related costs?6[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en6] Why should females not be members ofthe Dallas Cowboys and the Vienna Boys Choir? As one feminist organizationclaims: “There is no such thing as fair and unfair discrimination.”7[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en7]In this war between women and objectivity—between whims and reality—it isconsidered “discriminatory” to give priority to the latter combatant.But since reality per se is not very responsive to political protests, feministsdirect their grievances against the party they blame for “inventing” such anunyielding universe: men.It is men who push the idea of objectivity—feminism argues—as a means of keepingwomen subjugated. It is men who arbitrarily refuse to indulge a woman’s whims,as they insist that she be judged by merit, not gender. It is men who are toblame for every female who becomes a stewardess rather than a pilot, acheerleader rather than a quarterback, a secretary rather than a vice president.Feminists observe that males have somehow managed to succeed in reality. Theyhave somehow been able to acquire the jobs, the wealth, the fame, the happiness.The way for women to do likewise—feminists maintain—is, not to master reality,but to harness its surrogate: the male. How? By acting like the childrenfeminism believes they metaphysically are, and petulantly demanding that theirdesires be accommodated—by men. By insisting that they be given their“allowances,” in the form of prescribed quotas of jobs, promotions, collegeadmissions, etc.—to be produced and financed by men. (At least, the old hausfraumethod of directly latching onto a husband for financial security was a morehonest form of dependence.)This evaluation of women as non-volitional ciphers, and of men as their vileoppressors, is implicit throughout the feminist philosophy. But there is onearea in which this view is made virtually explicit: sex.Sex between a man and a woman is not what it seems, according to feminists—i.e.,it is not really voluntary. Law professor Susan Estrich, for instance, writes:“Many feminists would argue that so long as women are powerless relative to men,viewing a ‘yes’ as a sign of true consent is misguided.”8[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en8]Other feminists contend that a woman cannot be held accountable for her decisionto engage in sex. “There could be many reasons why a woman might not resist aman’s advances so that unwanted intercourse could occur without force. The woman... may be confused. Her socialization may make it difficult for her toresist.”9 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en9]In other words, women—adult women—are incapable of saying no when they do notwant to have sex. They are the passive, deterministic products of their“socialization.” Consequently, feminists say, women cannot be held responsiblefor having sex, any more than children can.This idea of women as volitionless doormats obliterates the distinction betweenthe voluntary and the forced. Do women have a rational faculty, by which theychoose whether or not to engage in sex? Not according to feminists, who declarethat “verbal coercion” constitutes rape. And what is “verbal coercion”? It is “awoman’s consenting to unwanted sexual activity because of a man’s verbalarguments not including verbal threats of force.”10[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en10] (Emphasis added.) So whenever the manutters anything indicating a desire for sex, any subsequent sexual activity, nomatter how willing the woman is, may well make him criminally liable.This is why, in incidents in which men are denounced (sometimes correctly) for“sexual misconduct”—such as the one at the Navy’s 1991 Tailhook convention—nodifferentiation is made between actions in which the women willingly engage andactions in which they are forced to participate. To the feminist, it is all“coercive.”On this view, it is not the objective facts that are legally decisive, but thewoman’s subjective emotions. Says law professor Catherine MacKinnon: “I call itrape whenever a woman has sex and feels violated.”11[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en11] (Emphasis added.)Facts are simply brushed aside by feminists. Since women are seen as incapableof exercising volition, the crucial distinction with respect to sex is, notbetween the woman’s giving and withholding consent, but between her feeling andnot feeling “violated” —a feeling on the basis of which men are to be indicted,tried and sentenced.A study of college students (“Project on Campus Sexual Assault”), sponsored byMs. magazine in 1985, is widely hailed as an authoritative, scientific survey ofthe prevalence of rape in American society. It found that over 25 percent ofcollege-age women had been victims of rape or attempted rape. This reinforcedthe portrait of a patriarchal culture in which women are under constant attackby, and need constant protection from, their natural enemy, the male.Yet it was only the survey’s distorted definition of rape—based on the view ofwomen as “socialized” puppets, unable to make their own decisions—that led tosuch a conclusion. For example, according to the questionnaire, if a womanaccepts a drink from a man and they then willingly have sex, it may beconsidered rape, because the man has “impair[ed] the other person’s judgment orcontrol by administering any drug or intoxicant.”12[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en12]In fact, of those classified by the survey as having been raped, 73 percentindicated that they themselves did not believe that the sexual activity inquestion constituted rape. And over 40 percent of the “victims” had sex againwith their “attackers.”13 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en13]This neo-hausfrau movement believes that women must be treated like children.They cannot be trusted to give “informed consent,” they cannot be relied upon toknow whether they have been raped and they need continuous parental supervisionto make sure their needs are being met.When a march on Washington was organized by the National Organization for Womento publicize “violence against women,” the objects of the protest were, not justrape or battery, but reductions in welfare spending and cutbacks in affirmativeaction programs. As reported in the New York Times, the feminists “equated whatthey called ‘political violence’ with physical attacks.”14[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en14] A parent who beats an infant and aparent who withholds meals from an infant are both guilty of physical abuse.Similarly—feminist thinking goes—adult women are “victimized” by a denial ofwelfare benefits as much as by a real assault.Just as the essence of rape, according to feminists, is not the act ofphysically forcing a woman to have sex, so the nature of its evil is not thecoercion—but the collective “discrimination” by one class against another.This primitive, tribalist view is most openly advocated by MacKinnon, whowrites: “Sexual violation is both a practice and an index of inequality betweenthe sexes, both a symbol and an act of women’s subordinate social status tomen.”15 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en15] Unable to perceive a woman asan individual even with respect to her being the target of an actual rape,MacKinnon sees the crime as being committed against the tribe. It is not that aparticular woman has been attacked by a particular man—or even that physicalforce has been used—but that one collective has been judged “inferior” toanother.Rape should be prosecuted as a “sex equality case,” MacKinnon says. In a rapetrial, the central questions about the accused would include: “How does this mantreat women sexually? Is he a sex bigot?” If the courts were to adopt thisapproach, she concludes, “At least rape would be called in law what it is inlife: sex discrimination.”16 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en16]But if the essence of rape is “discrimination”—what is the difference betweensex and rape? The act of sex is undeniably “discriminatory” —it discriminates bygender. Doesn’t that make it inherently evil?Whether the claim is that “yes” equals “no,” or that rape equals“inequality”—sex is transformed by feminists into the archetypal act ofaggression by men against women. Sex per se becomes rape. And all men becomeguilty of it.Rape, says one “acquaintance-rape educator,” “is not some form ofpsychopathology that afflicts a very small number of men. In fact rape is notthat different from what we see as socially acceptable or socially laudable malebehavior.”“17 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en17] Rape, says a notedfeminist author, is ”a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keepall women in a state of fear.“18 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en18](Emphasis in original.)What is the source of this enormous hostility toward men, and particularlytoward sex between men and women? The act of sex, Ayn Rand writes, is an act ofmetaphysical assertion: “To a rational man, sex is an expression ofself-esteem—a celebration of himself and of existence.... [I]t is his responseto his own highest values in the person of another.”19[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en19] (Emphasis in original.) Sex is anaffirmation of an individual’s self-worth, of his or her capability to livesuccessfully in reality and to experience the joy of such success.What assessment of sex, then, follows from an opposite metaphysics? If sex isgood because it celebrates the individual’s capacity to master reality andachieve values—how must feminists, who believe that a woman fundamentally lacksthat capacity, perceive sex?To them, sex is a union, not between two partners sharing their highest values,but between two antagonistic forces: a brutal despot—who wantonly denies womanher due by insisting that she earn her place in the world: and a feckless,perpetual victim—who desperately clings to others for her basic identity and forher very survival. On this view, sex for the woman is not a joyous affirmationof her sense of self-value, but an intolerable reinforcement of her sense ofhelplessness—and of her resentment toward the man for not being helpless.Sex, according to feminists, is sheer oppression. The woman is being dominated.She is being “taken” by her enemy. Sex is the quintessential “victimization” ofwoman—the woman who lacks the capacity even to assert her own will in the faceof male “verbal coercion.”Feminist theorist Andrea Dworkin, who depicts sex as “wartime invasion andoccupation,” presents this view unabashedly: “Physically, the woman inintercourse is a space inhabited, a literal territory occupied literally:occupied even if there has been no resistance, no force; even if the occupiedperson said yes please, yes hurry, yes more.” The fact that women may judge sexto be good makes the act all the worse, she says. These “occupied women [are]more base in their collaboration than other collaborators have ever been:experiencing pleasure in their own inferiority, calling intercourse freedom.”20[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#en20]Dworkin’s is not some “lunatic fringe” viewpoint. Her odious characterization ofsex follows logically from the feminist metaphysics. If the individual woman isa powerless, volitionless nonentity, then sex is a combination of callousinvasion and abject collaboration. Dworkin is merely being more consistent, andis taking feminist ideas more seriously, than many of her feminist cohorts.006 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_006_r1.jpg]The doctrine of feminism pervades today’s culture. To question and oppose its“politically correct” tenets, especially within academia, requires anindependent mind. That is, it requires precisely the faculty whose existencefeminism will not acknowledge—and whose force it cannot withstand.Feminism needs to be repudiated by everyone—man or woman—who recognizes thecrucial need to think, and to act, by oneself. If you understand that a humanbeing’s basic identity is self-created, and is not the product of gender—if yougrasp the fact of your capacity to achieve your own goals by your own effort—ifyou indignantly reject the demand that anyone live by the guidance and the powerof the collective—then do not permit the ideas of feminism to go unchallenged.Expose, and condemn, the self-effacing dependency that this “liberation”movement cultivates. Above all, let people see that the ideological battle overfeminism is not between the female and the male—but between tribalism andindependence.REFERENCES1 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c12_r1.html#Ref-en1] “Canada Court Says PornographyHarms Women,” New York Times, February 2, 1992, p.

It was Kant who declared thatman, to be certain that he is acting morally, must not merely ignore hisinterests—material or spiritual—but must willfully contradict them. It was Kantwho created a formal dichotomy between that which constitutes the good and thatwhich fulfills any need of human life.Kant’s philosophy gradually worked its way into Western culture. Now, some twohundred years later, a political movement has arisen that brazenly endorses thiskiller creed. It is a movement that seeks to prohibit the pursuit of humanvalues—because of one’s moral “duty” to the non-human. That movement is:environmentalism.Many people hold a benign view of environmentalism. They regard it as a salutaryforce, as a sort of global sanitation department. While critical of certain“excesses,” people believe that environmentalism fundamentally seeks to improveman’s life by cleaning up the dirt in his water and the pollutants in his air.But that is a dangerously superficial assessment. If one examines the conflictsbetween the interests of man and the “interests” of nature, it becomes clearthat the former are invariably sacrificed to the latter by environmentalists.Whenever there is a hydroelectric dam to be built, it is the welfare of thesnail darter or the Chinook salmon that is inviolate, and the welfare of manthat is dispensable. Whenever there is a choice between cutting down trees forhuman use and leaving them in place for the spotted owl, it is the bird’s homethat environmentalists save and human habitation that goes unbuilt.Huge tracts of Arctic land are off-limits to productive enterprises, in ordernot to disturb the caribou and the ice floes. Mosquito- and alligator-infestedswamps (euphemistically called wetlands) are deemed sacred, not to be defiled byman-made drainage. (Even land that is actually growing crops can be christenedwetlands, if some bureaucrat decides that vegetation typically found in swampscould have grown there had the crops not been planted.) The most beneficialprojects, from housing developments to science observatories, are halted ifthere is any danger—if there is any allegation of danger to some piddlingspecies.The incalculable damage inflicted on human beings by such prohibitions isimmaterial to environmentalists. They have abandoned even the pretext of holdinghuman happiness as their ultimate purpose. In its place, as an open secret thatthe public is unable to take fully seriously, is the premise that nature mustremain unchanged as an end in itself. It is the premise that nature must beprotected, not for man, but from man.Several years ago a controversy arose concerning a new cancer-fighting drug,taxol. It was found in the bark of the Pacific yew tree. The director of theNational Cancer Institute described taxol as “the most important new drug wehave had in cancer for fifteen years.”1[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en21] But environmentalists insisted thatthe trees, which are considered scarce and are home to the spotted owl, remainlargely untouched.Al Gore, in his book Earth in the Balance, declares himself incapable ofchoosing between people and trees: “It seems an easy choice—sacrifice the treefor a human life—until one learns that three trees must be destroyed for eachpatient treated.... Suddenly we must confront some tough questions.”2[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en22]According to an official of the Oregon Natural Resources Council: “The basicissue in our mind is that the yew [tree] is a finite resource.... Our concern isthat there will not be any left the way we are approaching this.”3[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en23] Not be any left—for whom? Certainly,his concern was not that the people now dying of cancer would lack trees fortheir treatment; those were the very people being denied available medicine bythe environmentalists. Nor was his concern that future cancer victims would gountreated; for that would imply an endorsement of a crash program to plant newtrees—and to cut down every single existing one that was needed for its taxol.Toward whom, then, was this official’s concern directed? Toward no one. Towardno human being, that is. Environmentalism wants to preserve those trees for thesake of the trees. It wants all the people who are suffering from cancer simplyto renounce this potential cure. It wants them to accept the inviolability ofthe yew tree.Environmentalists view man as the enemy. Their aim is to keep nature pristine,free from the predatory invasions of man. It is not human welfare that sets thestandard by which they make their judgments.For example, author Tom Regan argues that medical research on animals, designedto discover cures for human diseases, should be abolished. He says: “If it meansthat there are some things we cannot learn, then so be it. We have no basicright not to be harmed by those natural diseases we are heir to.”4[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en24]David Foreman, founder of the organization Earth First, puts it more bluntly:“Wilderness has a right to exist for its own sake, and for the sake of thediversity of the life forms it shelters; we shouldn’t have to justify theexistence of a wilderness area by saying, ‘Well, it protects the watershed, andit’s a nice place to backpack and hunt, and it’s pretty.’ ”5[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en25]David Graber, a biologist with the National Parks Service, revels in execratinghuman beings as trespassers upon nature. He describes himself as among those who“value wilderness for its own sake, not for what value it confers uponmankind.... We are not interested in the utility of a particular species, orfree-flowing river, or ecosystem, to mankind. They have intrinsic value, morevalue—to me—than another human body, or a billion of them. Human happiness, andcertainly human fecundity, are not as important as a wild and healthy planet....It is cosmically unlikely that the developed world will choose to end its orgyof fossil-energy consumption, and the Third World its suicidal consumption oflandscape. Until such time as Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature, someof us can only hope for the right virus to come along.”6[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en26](And speaking of viruses, they too have “rights.” According to Rutgers ecologistDavid Ehrenfeld, the world’s remaining supply of the smallpox virus should notbe exterminated, since it preys only on human beings.7[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en27])Taking this illogic one step further, there are now “ecoterrorists,” who useviolence against loggers and other “intruders” upon nature’s domain. A spokesmanfor the Green Party of Germany says: “We in the Green movement aspire to acultural model in which the killing of a forest will be considered morecontemptible and more criminal than the sale of six-year-old children to Asianbrothels.”8 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en28] And according to anactivist with Earth First, injuring or even murdering such “forest-killers” isjustifiable self-defense: “The holocaust against the environment and its speciesis the same as any holocaust against humans.”9[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en29] (Earth First’s apt slogan? “Back tothe Pleistocene”—the glacial era of one million years ago; it is no accidentthat the Unabomber was openly sympathetic to the goals of this group.)But if “wilderness has a right to exist for its own sake”—then man does not. Mansurvives only by altering nature to satisfy his own needs. Man cannot survive,as animals do, by automatically adapting to the natural surroundings in which hehappens to find himself. Nature’s vast wilderness, if passively accepted, isinimical to his survival. Man must transform the naturally given into a trulyhuman environment. He must produce the values his life requires—he must growfood and build supermarkets, chop down trees and erect condominiums, mine oreand design jet planes, isolate organisms and manufacture vaccines. None of thesevalues exists ready-made in nature. Man brings all of them into being only bytransmuting his “natural environment.”To live as a human being requires that one regard nature as nothing but a meanstoward one’s ends. Every cart, rowboat and space shuttle man has constructedviolates the “right” of land, sea and air to maintain their “natural states.”Every conscious decision to enhance human life—every attempt to rise above theanimals—entails the subduing of nature and the repudiation of environmentalistdoctrine. Man’s life depends upon his productiveness. In Ayn Rand’s words, itdepends on a “process by which man’s consciousness controls his existence, aconstant process of acquiring knowledge and shaping matter to fit one’s purpose,of translating an idea into physical form, of remaking the earth in the image ofone’s values.”10 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en30]But if man lives only by a process of remaking the earth—what is the implicationof the environmentalist demand that he renounce this process?Environmentalism insists that man give up the value of material comfort and theexpectation of material progress. He must distrust modem science and modemtechnology, since they only distance him from nature. He must forgo nuclearpower and genetic engineering, luxury cars and food additives, Styrofoam cupsand disposable diapers. He must stifle his inventiveness and shrink hiscognitive horizons. His ancient ancestors managed to get by without anagglomeration of artificial gadgets—so must he. The essence of this message isthat man should accept the only type of existence in true “harmony” with nature:an existence free of the man-made. Which means: for most, an early death; forthe others, a life of backbreaking toil and bare subsistence.The Worldwatch Institute, an environmentalist think tank, offers a starkconcretization of this ideal: “The Eskimo’s scrupulous use of every scrap ofseal or walrus in the face of absolute scarcity might serve as a symbol for allin the years ahead. Conspicuous and excessive consumption of energy and foodshould be discouraged by law and by social pressure, thus reducing demand.”11[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en31]All the imprecations against “excessive consumption”—all the exhortations to“recycle,” to “conserve energy,” to “save the earth”—have, as their motivation,a vision of the crudely primitive state of this Eskimo. That is theenvironmentalist nirvana. But why do people accept this? Why do the citizens of a modern, industrialsociety not recoil in horror at the attempt to establish privation as a virtue?Because of two insidious ideas pushed by environmentalists—one metaphysical, theother ethical. The first is that production cannot be “sustained”; the second,that it is unjust to “exploit” nature.The first idea springs from the old collectivist belief that wealth is creatednot by the individual, but by the tribe. This belief severs the act ofproduction from the (individual’s) faculty of reason. It was updated by KarlMarx, who maintained that the industrial factories and offices are somehow “justhere,” waiting to be coaxed by proletarian sweat and muscle into dischargingtheir riches.Environmentalists agree with this view of production as a mindless process.Production, they believe, consists in serendipitously finding the goods—indigging into the earth and uncovering what nature generously yields up. Thegoods are nature’s beneficent gift to us. In the act of production, man is justa bit player, while nature is the star.But whereas Marx implied that wealth is generated automatically, theenvironmentalist says it is not. The environmentalist holds that sinceproduction is not an act of reason, we cannot assume that the golden eggs willmagically continue to appear. Instead, he says, with every scrap of wealth wegreedily extract, with every clearing we plow and every bath we run, we“diminish” nature. By persistently trying to improve our environment to suit ourends, we are exceeding nature’s willingness to nurture us. We are not allowingher to “replenish” herself. We are not allowing her to set a “sustainable” pace.Production, therefore, is a hopeless effort. We are running out, theenvironmentalists cry. Of what? Of everything. The attempt to maintain ourpresent level of wealth—let alone to increase it—is futile. Nature’s fragile“ecosystem” simply will not allow it. We must resign ourselves to ourimpoverishment, because the mother lode is being exhausted.Marx said the goods are here somehow—so society should seize them. Whereas theenvironmentalists say the goods are here somehow, but will not be heretomorrow—so society should “conserve” them.It is not their own policies that are lowering our livingstandards—environmentalists disingenuously declare. The cause, rather, is thebuilt-in limitations of nature. And the only solution is for us to reconcileourselves to that fact. That is, since nature has only so much to give, we muststop seeking more. This injunction to make do with less is then resignedlyaccepted by the public because, it believes, there is no alternative.Now consider the enormity of what is being evaded by the proponents of thismetaphysics of scarcity. The Western world enjoys a material abundance at theend of the twentieth century that is orders of magnitude greater than whatexisted, say, in the tenth. The population is vastly larger, yet there arevastly more goods per person. Why? Certainly, natural resources have notmiraculously multiplied. There is no greater quantity now of iron, or rainfall,or sand or petroleum. Rather, man’s mind has been at work. Man has taken ironand made it into tools. He has taken waterfalls and made them into generators ofelectricity. He has transformed grains of sand into computer chips, and oozingblack glop into gasoline. A continuous reshaping of nature has occurred. Man hasgiven value to the raw materials that had always existed but had beenworthless—worthless, because they had been part of nature’s environment, notman’s.This is the essence of production: taking the elements of nature, rearrangingtheir form—and generating prosperity. It is a conceptual, quintessentially humanprocess. Wealth does not exist as a fixed, static quantity. It is the creationof a dynamic, boundless mind. And it has no inherent limitations.The doomsday stories about running out of some “finite resource” (includingthose coming from the Malthusian predecessors of today’s environmentalists) areendless; all of them ignore the causal connection between reason and production.For example, in 1908 the U.S. Geological Survey stated that the maximum futuresupply of crude oil in the U.S. was 22.5 billion barrels; eighty-seven years’worth of consumption later, there were over 22 billion barrels just in unused,proven reserves. In 1914 the U.S. Bureau of Mines said that future Americanproduction of oil could total no more than 5.7 billion barrels; in the followingeighty years, over 160 billion barrels were produced. In 1939 the Department ofthe Interior forecast that our oil supplies would last only another thirteenyears; some thirty years later, the rate of production alone had almosttripled.12 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en32]If one recognizes the intellectual root of production, one realizes thearbitrariness of extrapolating from present reserves to a remote future—evenwith respect to “non-renewable” resources. Goods are produced by rational menacting according to their knowledge and their evaluations. Proven reserves aremerely the quantity of some good that it is currently worthwhile to know isavailable when needed. But the finitude of a given stockpile is no basis forassuming that, when it is used up, scarcities may ensue. There is simply norational value in locating now all the sources of raw material for the goodsthat the market will demand only in some far-off future—just as no one wouldtake pains to identify today the particular store from which he will buy a newtelevision set in ten years when his current one wears out. (As the timeapproaches—if television has not been replaced by some superior product he willmake the effort to find a specific outlet from which to purchase what he needs.)This is why no “finite resources” have ever disappeared, even though they havebeen in use for millennia. The value of some mineral is not intrinsic in itssheer existence. Its value is a consequence of the fact that man has recognizedhow it can be made to fill a human need. Every step of creating this value, fromdiscovering how to mine it to inventing new uses for it, is an act of reason. Asmore of the known quantity of the good is used up and it becomes scarcer, itsvalue grows, and it then becomes rational to search for more supply—it becomesrational to develop improved means of production—it becomes rational to devisebetter and cheaper substitutes. All of this prevents a good from simply beingforever depleted. (Indeed, in a free market the known reserves often expand overtime. For example, between 1950 and 1994 the U.S. reserves of “finite” zinc rose271 percent; and of “finite” iron ore, 527 percent.13[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en33])Only a view of production as mere mechanical motion would make someone believethat what does not exist today will not come into existence tomorrow. That is anunwarranted conclusion, even assuming that the level of knowledge and technologyremains unchanged. It is doubly unwarranted given that one cannot know whatcognitive advances will be made tomorrow, or what new developments thoseadvances will make feasible on the day after tomorrow.Knowledge is hierarchical. Earlier knowledge makes possible later knowledge. Ina continual expansion of thought, every new idea is the key to countless newerones. Every new thought is another step up the cognitive ladder, providing awider, more efficient perspective from which to look out on reality—aperspective not attainable from the lower rung. Physical goods are the materialproduct of those thoughts, and will therefore increase as knowledge increases.As long as man is politically free—free to think, and free to act on hisideas——there will be no shortage of physical goods, any more than there can beof intellectual goods.The irony is that environmentalists sense the connection between reason andproduction (which is what makes them try to obscure it). This impels them toargue that we are running out of not only physical goods- -but ideas as well.The Worldwatch Institute, for example, in discussing “the depletion of physicalresources,” states: “[S]cientific advances in the near future will not be madeas frequently or as cheaply as in the past. The known conceptual ground has beenworked over pretty thoroughly, and subsequent explorers will find rich researchveins less exposed and harder to exploit”[!]14[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en34] (One can only be grateful that ourgenetic engineers and our computer designers—to indicate just two of the manyareas that have seen major scientific advances in recent years—were not deterredby such inanity.)This is a perfectly consistent application of environmentalism. There is nofundamental difference between the act of producing food and the act ofproducing ideas. The mind is the source of each. To deny its efficacy in thefirst, therefore, is to deny it in the second. The contention that a precarious scarcity is our fate—that unless we contentourselves with living in igloos and hunting for walrus, we are endangering thevery planet—paves the way for another, more lethal notion.After arguing that privation is metaphysically inescapable, environmentalistsproceed to insist that it is also desirable. That is, having maintained thatproduction is not the work of reason, they go on to denounce it as theft—theftfrom one’s neighbors, theft from future generations, theft from the earthitself. And this is the second crucial assertion on which their case depends:namely, that production—the “ exploitation” of nature—is morally wrong.Why, they ask, should you be allowed to extirpate nature’s wealth simply togratify your desires? Who are you to claim such a right for your own selfishpurposes? Who are you to declare that you have rights but that nature does not?According to environmentalism, there is no moral legitimacy to valuing yourselfabove the rest of nature. “Ecological egalitarianism,” as one author hails it,“accords nature ethical status at least equal to that of humans.”15[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en35]In other words, first environmentalism proclaims that the Spartan life of theprimitive Eskimo is unavoidable—then, that it is one’s moral duty to aspire toit. First you are told that the quest for prosperity is mindlessself-destruction—then, that sustaining your measly existence ought not takeprecedence over some swampland’s divine right to wetness.Only one code of ethics could make such a viewpoint possible: the code ofaltruism, the code that brands the pursuit of self-interest as evil. This beliefis environmentalism’s most potent weapon. What, after all, is more manifestlyselfish than the act of production itself, in which you remake nature to serveyour values? At its core, environmentalism is the demand that you surrender yourcomfort, your well-being, your self. Stop caring about your desire to behappy—it admonishes—and start worrying about how to please the snail darters andthe spotted owls.Altruism is the doctrine that man has no moral right to exist for his own sake.Taken from the Latin alter (or “other”), it is the doctrine that the solejustification for your life is your willingness to sacrifice it to others.Environmentalism is altruism unadulterated and uncamouflaged. In the past, thecall for sacrifice was made on behalf of other human beings, such as the poorand the sick. Now, in a faithful extension of the altruist maxim, the term“others” is merely being broadened. Now, we are being urged to sacrifice thehuman to the non-human.And if it is evil to live for your own sake, how can you resist such a demand?If self-abnegation is noble, what could be more praiseworthy than to subordinateyour existence to that of the bugs, the weeds, and the mud?The premise of self-sacrifice is embedded in the deceptive meaning now attachedto the very term “environment.” Logically, there can be no concept of an“environment” that is not the environment of someone (or something)—any morethan there can be “property” that exists independently of the owner of theproperty. “Environment” is a relational concept. It properly refers to thesurroundings of some entity as they relate to that entity.But that is not how the environmentalist employs the term. He subverts it todenote an “environment” severed from any relationship to man—which then enableshim to mislead people into evaluating it apart from any relationship to man.That is, he initially counts on its correct meaning, so that people accept aneed to care about the fate of the “environment”—which they assume in some wayis their environment and is linked to their fate. This is why the movement’sfocus is pointedly on the “environment,” rather than on the non-relationalconcept “nature.” But once a confused public has been taken in,environmentalists repackage “environment” to denote something upheld as existingseparately from human beings.Cashing in on the altruist ethics, they condemn as wrong—as selfish—the viewthat any human value must be a value to man. Just as they want you to believe itis wrong to define “environment” only in relation to man, they want you tobelieve it is wrong to evaluate it only in relation to man. It is erroneous,they say, to believe that the only “environment” worth protecting is one that isuseful to human beings. A vein of iron ore, or a forest, or a sunrise should beregarded as values, they say, not because it benefits man, but because it“benefits” nature. These things have “value” the environmentalist declares—apartfrom any connection to, or evaluation by, human beings.According to the tenets of altruism, you should “value” that which holds nosignificance for your life—because it holds no significance for your life. Sowhile nature’s bogs and bugs may not be of any value to you, the precept ofself-sacrifice commands: that is why you should treat them as though they are.Thus, even the putative treasures of environmentalists—such as parks set asideas enclaves of uncommercialized, unindustrialized nature are not permitted to beused as sources of enjoyment for man.For example, when Yellowstone Park was devastated by fire in 1988, firefightingefforts were prohibited for weeks. Park officials allowed the fire to rage outof control, because it had begun naturally (through lightning). By the timefirefighters were finally permitted to contain the conflagration, well over onemillion acres had burned, at a cost of 150 million dollars. What was the motivebehind this lunacy? “Fire is a benign rather than a malignant force,” explainedYellowstone’s chief naturalist. He and other park officials viewed their primaryresponsibility during the disaster, not as preventing further damage by nature’sfire, but as safeguarding the grounds against “unnatural” encroachments. As anews report in the New York Times described it: “They said they were trying toprotect pristine areas from the destructive effects of bulldozers, fire enginesand irrigation pipes.”16 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en36]Yellowstone Park was regarded not as a value to man, but as a “value” to and forits natural self. So why not let it burn down, as long as the flames were partof its “natural” state? The head of the Glacier Institute put the philosophicissue this way: “It comes down to what we expect those lands to be. Is the parkprimarily for human use or their recreation? Or is the park to be maintained inits original state, letting fires do what they’re going to do?”17[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en37]In other words: is man morally entitled to use nature to benefit himself—or musthe become nature’s self-sacrificing menial?It is obvious which alternative environmentalists choose. Technology—whichrepresents the conquest of nature by the human mind—is therefore an object offear and hatred. It is routinely denounced by environmentalists. They greetevery technological advance—from food preservatives to growth hormones tocloning—with a knee-jerkful of scare stories. Technological achievements arepsychological threats to the environmentalist. They stand as testimony to thefact that man is both capable and worthy of living. To the nature-venerator, whocries that man can be neither, this is a terrifying reproach. So he reacts bytrying to suppress technology (while rationalizing that he harbors only“practical” concerns about human safety).Environmentalism is a systematic campaign to make man feel puny. It is a screedagainst self-esteem. It wants man to proclaim his own insignificance and totremble before the mountains and the mites.Today’s man is told by environmentalists that he—like his primitiveancestors—must hold nature in quivering awe. He is to be, not the ruler ofnature, but its obedient thrall. That is, he is to worship nature—as a God.Environmentalism amounts to a modern, secularized form of religion. It is anideology that instructs man to prostrate himself before a superior, ineffableforce. It is an ideology that declares the human mind too feeble to grasp thecomplexities of an inscrutable world, or “ecosystem.” It is an ideologypropelled by the desire to have man subordinate himself to a hallowed power—apower which must be placated and paid homage, if man is to receive the graciousbounty upon which his existence depends.This mysticism is now openly avowed within the environmentalist movement. Forinstance, New Left mandarin Tom Hayden taught a course at Santa Monica Collegeon “Environment and Spirituality.” It began with a discussion of the Bible, andended with the prospects for what he called a new “earth-oriented religion.”Hayden explained: “We need to see nature as having a sacred quality, so werevere it and are in awe of it. That forms a barrier to greed and exploitationand overuse.”18 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en38]The Ecoforestry Institute, in a full-page ad opposing the logging of trees, saysabout forests: “They have an intrinsic value beyond objective measure. A societythat sees them only as a resource to be exploited, as a crop to be marketed, haslost its sense of the sacred. Saving America’s forests is more than an economicor ecological issue. It is a spiritual one as well.”19[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en39] (Emphasis in original.)This unearthly fusion of religion and environmentalism originated with the NewLeft. As Paul Ehrlich writes: “It is probably in vain that so many look toscience and technology to solve our present ecological crisis. Much more basicchanges are needed, perhaps of the type exemplified by the much-despised‘hippie’ movement—a movement that adopts most of its religious ideas from thenon-Christian East. It is a movement wrapped up in Zen Buddhism, physical loveand a disdain for material wealth.”20 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en40]Predictably, the representatives of environmentalism and of religion are forgingovert ties. For example, the late scientist Carl Sagan issued “an appeal forjoint commitment in science and religion.” It was a call for transformingenvironmentalism into a religious crusade. “We are close to committing—manywould say we are already committing—what in religious language is sometimescalled Crimes against Creation,” he said. Environmentalism “must be recognizedfrom the outset as having a religious as well as scientific dimension.... Thusthere is a vital role for both religion and science. We hope this appeal willencourage a spirit of common cause and joint action to help preserve theEarth.”21 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en41] (This was signed by a numberof prominent scientists, including Hans Bethe and Stephen Jay Gould, and by overtwo hundred religious leaders across the globe—from the dean of the HarvardDivinity School to the Secretary-General of the National Council on IslamicAffairs to the abbot of the Zen Community of New York.)Even Pope John Paul II has taken up the cause. Contrary to those who regardChristianity as incompatible with environmentalism, the pope sees theirfundamental unity. He has declared that world peace is threatened by “a lack ofdue respect for nature, by the plundering of natural resources and by aprogressive decline in the quality of life.... Today, the dramatic threat ofecological breakdown is teaching us the extent to which greed andselfishness—both individual and collective[!]—are contrary to the order ofcreation, an order which is characterized by mutual interdependence.... Thecommitment of believers to a healthy environment for everyone stems from theirbelief in God the Creator, from their recognition of the effects of original andpersonal sin, and from the certainty of having been redeemed by Christ.”22[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en42]Both the Church and environmentalism condemn the conception of nature assomething to be refashioned by and for man. Both believe that man must repudiatethe virtue of productiveness and of pride. Whether the commandment is to makeuse of nature in service to God or to make use of nature in service toendangered species—man is rendered a servant. Either way, the principle is thesame: man must sacrifice his selfish enjoyment of earthly comforts in deferenceto a “higher” power. There remains one final issue to be examined in judging environmentalism: itsclaim to science. In trumpeting the dangers of particular industrial productsand activities, environmentalists typically invoke all kinds of empiricalevidence. How, then, can their allegations be summarily dismissed? Isn’t thehonest opponent of environmentalists obligated to investigate, and refute, alltheir evidence? How can one ignore the copious research, the clinical studies,the laboratory experiments, the complex computer models--all supposedly provingthe dire consequences of various technologies? Isn’t cold, hard science on theside of environmentalism?The answer is: no—and the very question reflects the environmentalists’ worstperversion of all. Their scientific garb is a masquerade. It is designed to hidethe fact that their claims do not rest on scientific evidence, but on theopposite: on a sweeping rejection of the methodology of science. Consider, forexample, the environmentalists’ case against Alar.Alar is a chemical developed in the early 1960s that improves the appearance ofapples and delays their ripening. In 1989, it became the target of a campaign toban it, orchestrated by the Natural Resources Defense Council. The NRDCannounced that it had conducted tests revealing that Alar causes cancer inpeople. The news media heralded the story of a greedy manufacturer foisting histoxic product upon unsuspecting, apple juice—drinking children. Alarmed farmers,grocers, and parents began avoiding apples. The apple-growing industry lost over200 million dollars. The manufacturer was compelled to remove Alar from themarket.But what was the scientific basis for these claims? The NRDC tests did indeedshow that Alar produced tumors in mice—in doses equivalent to what a human beingwould absorb by eating fourteen tons of apples a day for seventy years. (Andmice fed half that amount—the equivalent of seven tons a day for seventyyears—produced no tumors at all.)23 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en43]An earlier study of rodents by the Environmental Protection Agency alsosupposedly showed a link between Alar and cancer. Yet according to the EPA’s owndata, the average human exposure to the allegedly carcinogenic chemical was.000047 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg); the mice in the EPAstudy, however, were given doses of 7 mg/kg (for males) and 13 mg/kg (forfemales)—a level 148,000 to 276,000 times that of human exposure. (And even atthat level, none of the rats in the study was stricken with cancer.)24[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en44]This is considered sufficient grounds for panicking the public and crippling anindustry.Or consider the pesticide DDT. It was banned in the U.S. in 1972, largelybecause it was said to be carcinogenic. That conclusion was based on studiesthat found DDT to cause benign liver tumors in mice (and nothing at all in otherexperimental animals) —and even then, only at doses 100,000 times higher thanwhat a person would absorb by ingesting DDT through residues in food.25[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en45]It is now accepted practice in environmentalist circles to assume that if somequantity of a substance is harmful, then any quantity is. But is there anysubstance on earth about which this context-dropping claim cannot be made?Everything can become deadly in sufficiently large doses—including water, orair, or organically grown soybeans. If a one-ton piano crashing down on you isfatal, does this imply that a one-ounce feather floating onto your shouldersonce a day for eighty-eight years is also a threat? Potatoes contain arsenic;lima beans contain cyanide; nutmeg contains a hallucinogen; broccoli contains asubstance that causes cancer in animals.26[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en46] Should these be outlawed? None of theenvironmental “scientists” cares to publicize an obvious fact: the dosage levelmakes all the difference between safety and danger.They don’t care to publicize this—because they have an agenda other than thepresentation of the truth. Dishonesty, as one of these pseudo-scientistsexplains, is their best policy: “We have to offer up scary scenarios, makesimplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we mayhave. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effectiveand being right.”27 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en47]Virtually any claim about some industrial danger is given instant publicity byenvironmentalists, while evidence of the benefits (or of the falsehood of theallegation of danger) is systematically disregarded. Paul Ehrlich, for example,has made a living out of issuing apocalyptic statements that the world isrunning out of food. In 1968 he wrote: “The battle to feed all of humanity isover. In the 1970s the world will undergo famines—hundreds of millions of peopleare going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world deathrate.... We must have population control at home, hopefully through a system ofincentives and penalties, but by compulsion if voluntary methods fail.”28[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en48] (Emphasis added.)Yet reality’s repeated debunking of Ehrlich’s predictions (to say nothing of thehorrifying totalitarianism of his proposed “solution”) has not diminished hisstatus as an influential prophet. His regularly updated scenarios of doom arestill taken seriously by the environmentalists; his well-known book ThePopulation Bomb has gone through more than two dozen printings.With respect to DDT, the promoters of “eco-hysteria” ignore a study in whichpeople were fed DDT every day for up to twenty-seven months—with no harmfulresults. They ignore the fact that during the period of heaviest DDT use in theUnited States, from 1944 to 1972, deaths from liver cancer dropped 30 percent.29[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en49]And, most tellingly, they ignore the benefits of DDT (and the consequent harmcreated by its prohibition). They ignore the fact that before the advent of DDT,malaria was rampant. In Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), for example, there were 2.8million cases of malaria in 1948. By 1963, because DDT killed the insectsbearing the disease, the number had dropped to 17! But in the late 1960s, thespraying was halted due to the growing attacks on DDT; by 1969 the number ofmalaria cases in Sri Lanka had gone back to 2.5 million. In India, about 75million cases of malaria occurred in 1951; ten years later (after DDT wasintroduced) the figure had fallen to 50,000; by 1977, however, it had risen toat least 30 million.30 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en50] Today, millionsof people a year are dying from malaria as a result of environmentalists’hostility toward pesticides. (But of course the truth about DDT is unimportantwhen compared with the need for “being effective.”)The environmentalist utilizes science, not to discover the facts, but toobfuscate them. After stripping away the veneer of rationality, one willdiscover that the hallmark of the catastrophe claim is the half-truth and theout-of-context fact.When environmental “scientists” claim, for instance, that thousands of highlyacidic and fishless lakes in the Northeast (the most severe cases of which arein the Adirondacks) are proof of the destructiveness of “acid rain” caused bycoal-burning electric utilities—they neglect to mention: that most of the acidiclakes in the Adirondacks were acidified by natural organic acids; or that theaverage Adirondack lake is more alkaline now than one hundred fifty years ago;or that highly acidic, fishless waters exist naturally in regions with noindustrial activity, such as the Rio Negro in the Amazon Basin (a river systemthe size of the Mississippi River).31 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en51]When environmental “scientists” claim that man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)have depleted the stratosphere of ozone, leaving us more exposed to the sun’sultraviolet radiation—they neglect to mention: that during the period when theozone layer was presumably diminishing, the levels of ultraviolet radiation atthe earth’s surface were falling32 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en52]; orthat, at its peak, the world output of CFCs was 1.1 million tons annually, while300 million tons of natural chlorine reach the atmosphere each year through theevaporation of seawater alone33 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en53]; orthat a 5 percent drop in ozone—which is of a magnitude that elicits grimcalculations of increased skin cancers—would, according to those verycalculations, result in a rise in radiation equivalent to that experienced bysomeone who merely moves sixty miles closer to the equator (say, from SantaBarbara to Los Angeles).34 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en54]When environmental “scientists” claim that overpopulation is exhausting theearth’s capacity to sustain its inhabitants—they neglect to mention: that suchconclusive yardsticks as per-capita food production and life expectancy areshowing regular increases 35 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en55]; or thatlife improves most where industrialization is strongest; or that finding spacefor a growing population is such a non-problem that if all 5.8 billionearthlings relocated to Texas tomorrow, the resultant population density (22,000people per square mile) would not be even half the current density of, say,Paris.36 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en56]This whole warped approach is the antithesis of science and objectivity. It isnot scientific truth that environmentalists seek to discover—it is not realitythat they hold as an absolute it is not reason that shapes their conclusions.Reason is only an obstacle to the goals of these “scientists”—and some of themreadily admit it.For instance, author Jonathan Schell discusses the nature of the evidencenecessary to form conclusions about environmental matters. He writes thatscientists should “disavow the certainty and precision they normally insist on.Above all, we need to learn to act decisively to forestall predicted perils,even while knowing that they may never materialize.... Scientists need to becomeconnoisseurs and philosophers of uncertainty.... The incurable uncertainty ofour predicament, far from serving to reassure us, should fill us with unease andgoad us to action.”37 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en57]Let’s translate this: Despite the lack of rational evidence for some claim ofimpending doom, we should nonetheless assume that it is true. Certainty andprecision may be appropriate in dealing with other issues, but not environmentalones. The knowledge we have about some technology’s vast benefits is to beoutweighed by the absence of knowledge we have about its alleged harmful-ness.It does not matter, therefore, that these “philosophers of uncertainty” do notknow whether their statements are true. As long as a prediction of theirs can“fill us with unease,” it should be acted on, whether it can be scientificallyproved or not.The aim of the environmentalists’ studies and experiments, then, is not theidentification of accurate, scientific knowledge, but the inculcation of a stateof hysterical ignorance. Blind emotion, not reason, is to be our guide in comingto conclusions.I am not a scientist, and I have not thoroughly investigated these issues. Icannot say that I have conclusive proof that CFCs are not threatening the ozonelayer or that factory emissions are not changing the earth’s temperature. Butwhat I can say about the environmentalists’ claims is something morefundamental: they warrant no cognitive attention—because they are not attemptsat cognition. They are arbitrary vociferations. They do not represent efforts toreach objective truths. Therefore, as utterances issued not to illuminatereality but to distort it, they should not be admitted into the realm ofscience.In this respect, the environmentalist methodology is identical to that of the“Scientific Creationists.”The Creationists’ claims about errors in the theory of evolution are not basedon science. The Creationists do not want to discover the facts about the originof life. They use science merely as a facade, to disguise the fact that theBible is the source of their beliefs and that their only agenda is a religiousone. They do not seek genuine evidence for their position, because they do notaccept any necessity for evidence. No facts or arguments will sway them, becausetheir viewpoint does not rest on facts and arguments: it rests on faith. None oftheir “refutations” of evolution, therefore, qualifies as science.Once the Creationists’ basic method has been discredited, one need notscrutinize every new assertion they come up with. One need not disprove suchassertions—indeed, one should not even try to, since it only legitimizes them—inorder to defend the validity of evolution. The only rational response to allCreationist “arguments” is to dismiss them as being outside the realm of therational. They simply deserve no cognitive respect—including even the respect ofidentifying them as “true” or “false.”The statements of environmentalists ought to be accorded the same αscientificstatus. Just as when you wish to determine the facts about evolution, thepronouncements of Creationists should be irrelevant to your search; so too, ifyou wish to determine the facts about a particular environmental question, youshould do so independently of the declarations made by environmentalists. (Yes,it may turn out that some allegation of theirs happens to be true—by accident,as a parrot’s squawkings may coincidentally parallel some fact of reality. Ifthis occurs, and one ascertains it by rational means, appropriate steps shouldbe taken to alleviate the danger—steps that logically cannot include anyrenunciation of technological progress.)If and when there is genuine evidence that something man-made is harmful tohuman health or damaging to property, the victim is entitled to legalremedies—on the basis of standard laws that have long existed. These are thesame kinds of laws that prevent your neighbor from starting a fire or releasingtear gas in his backyard if it will reach yours. If you can show that you werehurt by someone’s actions, your rights should be protected by law. But you mustmeet one requirement: you must be able to prove your case objectively.To environmentalists, this requirement is an unacceptable impediment. They donot want to be bound by the strictures of logic and science in their efforts tostifle production. Reason is not the method suited to their ends. They want to“disavow certainty and precision”—and to have government regulators accept theirun-proved assertions on faith.The way to assess environmentalism, therefore, is not as a scientific issue, butas a moral one. In response to all the claims about the harm posed by varioustechnologies, one must ask a basic question: “Harmful—by what standard?” Foraccording to the standard of man’s life here on earth, technology as such isbeneficial—wealth as such is beneficial--material progress as such isbeneficial. According to a rational standard, no actual threats to human welfarecould justify the destruction of that upon which man’s welfare depends—namely,production, technology, and freedom. The solution to any such threats mustembrace improved production, better technology, more capitalism.But environmentalists do not hold such a standard. What they find “harmful” isman’s liberation from a life of primitive toil and bare subsistence. To them,the “harm” lies in the very existence of technology, wealth, and progress; itlies in the fact of industrialization per se. Paul Ehrlich, for instance,declares: “We’ve already had too much economic growth in the United States.Economic growth in rich countries like ours is the disease, not the cure.”38[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en58]According to the group Earth First. “If radical environmentalists were to inventa disease to bring human populations back to sanity, it would probably besomething like AIDS. It has the potential to end industrialism, which is themain force behind the environmental crisis.”39[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en59]This is why environmentalists show no concern for all the suffering and deathsresulting from the absence of technology. This is why they do not care abouttheir “ideal” Eskimo’s lack of indoor plumbing, central heating, electricity,dentistry, and heart-transplant technology. This is why they are untroubled bythe demonstrable evils resulting from all the roads and oil refineries andnuclear plants not built—not built, because of the environmentalist desire toprotect nature from man.This is also why, whatever dangers environmentalists claim to find, their answeris always to denounce progress and to search for “nature-friendly” alternatives.If acid rain is supposedly destroying our lakes, they direct us not toneutralize it easily with some alkaline—but to shut down the factories. Iftopsoil is supposedly being eroded, they direct us not to invent methods of moreefficient farming—but to stop harvesting the crops. If there is too muchtraffic, they direct us not to build better highways—but to stop making thecars. Whatever the alleged problem, their incessant “solution” is:de-industrialize.Environmentalists believe that “chemicals” are bad, additives are bad,artificial flavoring is bad, preservatives are bad, synthetic fibers arebad—that “interfering” with the processes of nature is inherently immoral. Theyban food additives that supposedly cause cancer—yet are indifferent to thenatural presence of the identical substances in foods. They condemn DDT—yetdisregard the fact that we ingest 10,000 times more naturally producedpesticides than man-made ones.40 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c13_r1.html#en60] Theypraise societies that wallow in the filth and disease that characterize anon-technological “harmony” with nature—yet condemn those that enjoy thecleanliness and health resulting from modem sewage systems, washing machines,refrigeration, and polio vaccines. Whatever is a product of human design, inother words, is by that fact baneful; whatever is natural is by that factbenign.This view of the man-made as intrinsically noxious is simply the corollary ofthe premise that nature is intrinsically good. The environmentalists’ perversestandard of value is: the human is the harmful—and the way to achieve human“welfare” is to do away with the human.Environmentalism seeks the renunciation of all progress and pleasure. Its goalis not the elimination of air pollution or filthy water—or anything elseactually harmful to man. (If there are people animated by such concerns, theyshould form a new pro-technology /anti-dirt organization; but they should notally themselves with the Paul Ehrlichs, the David Grabers, and the DavidForemans, whose dictatorial aims are only abetted by unthinking“fellow-travelers.”)Environmentalists do not want to promote human happiness, or even the“happiness” of other species. Those who are callously indifferent to themillions of people who die annually because DDT has been banned will not bemoved to moral outrage at the “injustice” of some spotted owl losing its nest.What environmentalists desire is not the welfare of the non-human--but themisery of man.This is true of all manifestations of altruism. It is not the poor whomaltruists wish to lift up (if it were, they would advocate laissez-fairecapitalism); it is rather the productive whom they wish to bring down. But whenthe demand for self-sacrifice takes the form of environmentalism, the desire todestroy becomes more overt. In that form, there is far less pretense of pursuingany human values. There is only the snarling demand for universal deprivation. The philosophic inspiration for all this is Immanuel Kant. It was Kant, theprimary secularizer of religion, whose characteristic approach was to propound amysticism dressed up as rationality. It is environmentalism that has thoroughlyimplemented his philosophy.Kant postulated a “noumenal” world—a non-material world unknowable to man, aworld that transcends human perception and human interests, a world thatrepresents “true reality” because it is “unfiltered” by human consciousness.Environmentalism proceeds to postulate an ineffable “ecosystem”—a dimensionwhose arcane workings are accessible only to those possessing the facultydescribed by the Ecoforestry Institute as a “sense of the sacred,” a dimensionin which it is considered “unnatural” for man to engage in what his liferequires—productive activity—a dimension that remains “real” only as long as itis unsullied by human values.Kant maintained that reason can give us only a distorted picture of reality,that the mind is unreliable and can never be in touch with existence “as itreally is.” Environmentalism too maintains that man’s mind is incapable ofgrasping, and thereby governing, nature, that only if we “disavow certainty andprecision” can we apprehend the actual devastation industrialization is sowing,that rational science blinds us to the truth that the squashing of some insector the trampling of some shrub may bring a fragile planet crashing intooblivion.And obviously, environmentalism’s exhortations to sacrifice for nature—tosurrender our self-interest, not for religion’s promise of bliss in someafterworld nor for Marx’s assurance of prosperity in some indefinable future,but to surrender it as our rewardless obligation to the snail darters and thewetlands, to surrender everything human to anything non-human-what is that, butKant’s “categorical imperative” to submit to moral duty, for no reason and forno human end, but for the sake of submission as an end in itself?The method that Kant instituted, and that environmentalism has adopted, consistsof a continual inversion of the rational and the irrational. It consists ofKant’s proclamation that whatever man perceives is not real, because heperceives it, and that whatever is of value to man is not moral, because it is avalue. And it consists of environmentalism’s final corruption: the declarationthat production is destruction—the declaration that whatever wealth we producemakes us poorer, because we have produced it.Kant used the prestige of reason—to undermine reason and objectivity;environmentalism uses the prestige of science—to undermine science andproduction. Both insidiously pose as advocates of the rational—Kant, bypretending that it is not really reason that he is negating; environmentalists,by pretending that it is not really production (but only “unsustainable”production) that they are attacking. Both, at root, seek to render human lifeand happiness impossible.The single basic truth uttered by environmentalists is about themselves: theywant to crush what they regard as the evil of self-interest. Their ideology hastaken hold not in spite of its opposition to the requirements of man’s life—butbecause of it, because it has latched firmly onto the prevailing culturalpremise of self-sacrifice. In their campaign for privation, this moralevaluation is their strongest weapon.It is time to disarm them.There is only one practical way of fighting environmentalism: by morallydefending man. The apologetic attempts to oppose environmentalist laws byshowing how much better off the “environment” would be through private,non-bureaucratic efforts, are—like the appeasing attempts to fight the welfarestate by arguing that capitalism is more compassionate toward thehomeless—doomed to failure. Instead, what needs to be upheld, proudly andunequivocally, is the principle that there is no value in nature apart from thatwhich is of value to man, which means: there is no “environment”—other than theenvironment of man.The men who live by that premise—the men who make civilization and progresspossible—are choking on the philosophic pollution of environmentalism. They needto be freed from the suffocating clutches of the worshipers of a virgin earth.They need to breathe air—the liberating air of industrialization. They need tobe left free to produce—to continue creating the magnificent abundance that haslifted humanity out of the caves and jungles of the pre-industrial era. And whoare these individuals?

Every stepforward entailed the knowledge not only of how to take that step, but of why itwas a value—of why it was a step forward. It was not enough for men to learn,for example, how to hunt with knives or spears; they had to evaluate thisknowledge and conclude that hunting with weapons was better than hunting withbare hands. Across the entire span of history, man had to comprehend suchtruths—the truth that planting crops was better than foraging off the land, thatindoor plumbing was better than outhouses, that electricity was better thancandlelight, that science was better than superstition. Not just “different,”but better—objectively better.Mankind advanced only because some individuals originated better ways of doingthings (and because the rest of society came to see the validity of thoseinnovations). When some exceptional prehistoric man conceived the uses of fire,he understood the advantage of cooked meat over raw meat. His achievement wasnot regarded as the biased product of a “heat-centrist,” who was insensitive tothose who preferred their mastodon uncooked. In order to advance, men had todiscern that certain products had value—i.e., that they were worth creating,worth using, and worth defending.The history of mankind is the history of the creation of values. The recognitionthat some things further human life and are therefore good, while other thingsdo not and are therefore bad, is what made civilization possible. It is thispremise that enabled man to progress from numerology to mathematics, fromastrology to astronomy, from alchemy to chemistry—and from the cave to theskyscraper.It is this progression that today’s dominant intellectuals wish to undo.Nothing is objectively better than anything else, they assert. Anyone whoelevates Western civilization above primitive, voodoo-worshiping tribes—anyonewho admires the skyscraper and scorns the cave—is looking at life through adistorting, “Eurocentric” prism.These intellectuals are the multiculturalists. They argue, not for the obviousproposition that many cultures exist, but for the invidious proposition that allare equal in value. Every culture is “different,” they say—but none is superior.And what is the ultimate goal of this ideology? To reverse the process ofcivilization, by wrenching man back to a primeval state of existence.Multiculturalism’s major battleground is the classroom. There, beneath itsbromidic protestations about wanting to change the educational curricula only to“broaden” the content and expose students to “different” ways of life, itshostility toward rational values is readily revealed.In New York City, for example, a local school board decided to comply with themulticulturalists’ dictate to teach students about other cultures. But the boardwanted to present such information in the context of the superiority of Americanideals. It passed a resolution stating: “We reject the notion that all culturesshould be taught in an atmosphere of moral equivalency.”1[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en61]This offended the multiculturalists, who refused to tolerate the upholding ofcertain values over others. The school chancellor, for one, denounced theboard’s stand: “I firmly believe it is possible to gain an appreciation ofAmerican culture and values without derogating other cultures.”2[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en62] (In other words, a teacher mustrefrain from suggesting any deficiency in a culture that practices, say, slaveryor cannibalism-and, further, must persuade the class that such moral neutralityis consistent with “an appreciation of American culture and values.”)A school board in Florida made a similar attempt to comply with the ostensibleaims of multiculturalism. It designed a program to instruct students about othercultures—and simultaneously to “instill an appreciation of our American heritageand culture, such as: our republican form of government, capitalism, a freeenterprise system” and “other basic values that are superior to other foreign orhistoric cultures.” An irate teachers union declared that this violated thespirit of multiculturalism. The union threatened to sue the school board forignoring a state law that students must be taught to “eliminate personal andnational ethnocentrism so that they understand that a specific culture is notintrinsically superior or inferior to another.”3[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en63]What multiculturalism seeks is not to broaden, but to shrink our knowledge ofthe cultures of the world. That is, it seeks to expunge our awareness of thevalue of an American or Western—or rational—way of life, and the disvalue of itsantipodes. Multiculturalism wants to do away with all such discriminations. Itwants to erase the distinction between the two opposite ends of the normativescale, i.e., between the primitive and the civilized.But multiculturalists are not promiscuous valuers, indiscriminately grantingequal validity to whatever people choose and asking only for universal toleranceof all choices. They are not blandly indifferent to values. Rather, theircharges of “intolerance” and “exclusion” are consistently targeted against onespecific category of choices. They regularly criticize Americans for“insensitivity” toward the “Third World,” but never criticize, say, Rwandans forinsufficiently appreciating the culture of capitalism. They condemn colleges forteaching that the Great Works of Western minds are better than the scrawlings ofrandom jungle dwellers—but they do not seem to find the reverse viewunacceptable.The discriminations that multiculturalism rejects are those in which acivilized, Western culture is held as superior to a primitive one—i.e., in whichthe rational is valued while the irrational is not—i.e., in which an actualvalue is being embraced and a non-value spurned. That is the only “intolerance”they find intolerable. When multiculturalists vilify Christopher Columbus for“corrupting” the Indians, they are attacking the view that the culture Columbusrepresents is good, that reason and science are better than mysticism andsavagery, that life in the advanced, productive Renaissance societies of Europewas objectively superior to life in the barbarous, warring tribes of the NewWorld.All the “multi-ethnic” assaults on the educational curriculum are variants ofthis antagonism toward the non-primitive. Multiculturalists recommend, forexample, the teaching of “ethnomathematics,” as a way to persuade failingminority students that the most primitive forms of mathematics (such as “Africansand drawings”) are as valid as the most advanced.4[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en64] New York State high schools are nowrequired to teach that the Iroquois Indians (who were paid by England during theRevolutionary War to direct their scalp-taking proclivities exclusively towardthe colonies) inspired the American Constitution.5[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en65] A University of Pennsylvania professorderides American colleges for emphasizing reading and writing, which “are merelytechnologies of control” and are “martial law made academic”; he demands,instead, a greater focus on the “voices of newly emerging peoples” who challenge“Western hegemonic arrangements of knowledge” and who uphold the ancient oraltradition (as manifested, for example, in “rap music”).6[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en66]The motive for upholding such blatant non-values is to undercut authenticvalues. The multiculturalist cannot abide the idea that the mathematics of todayis good, while primitive “African sand drawings” are worthless. Who are we tomake such assessments? —the multiculturalist snarls. Who are we to laudColumbus, or to regard the modern physician as superior to the tribal medicineman, or to deem the skill of reading and writing more desirable than thecapacity to narrate folktales? Who are we to say that the Western is better thanthe non-Western, the scientific better than the non-scientific, the rationalbetter than the irrational?Multiculturalism is the debased attempt to obliterate values by claiming thatthey are indistinguishable from non-values. Multiculturalism is an assault notsimply against the evaluation of cultures, but against values as such. It is anassault on the sine qua non of human life—against the identification ofsomething as good.A prime illustration of this is the notorious “Specific Manifestations ofOppression.” This is a circular distributed by the Office of Student Affairs atSmith College. It declares that “people can be oppressed in many ways and formany reasons because they are perceived to be different.” To name this, “newwords tend to be created to express the concepts that the existing languagecannot.” 7 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en67] One such neologism ofoppression, cited in the circular, is:“Ethnocentrism”—which is defined as: “oppression of cultures other than thedominant one in the belief that the dominant way of doing things is the superiorway.”8 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en68]But “dominant” means only “prevailing over others.” What if a culture prevailsover others because it is in fact better, and because people comprehend thatfact? In America, for instance, the prevailing culture endorses freedom ratherthan dictatorship, and the laws of science rather than the myths of the occult.Is this “oppressive” to the cultures that deny freedom? Is it “oppressive” toconclude that surgery cures illnesses and should be applauded, while faithhealing does not and should be scorned? How have these students come to be sodetached from reality that they find it inconceivable that one “way of doingthings” may actually be superior to another? Can’t one judge some viewpoints tobe right, and therefore to be better than those that are wrong?To the multiculturalist, however, nothing can give rise to suchdifferentiations. The belief that one idea is better than another—regardless ofwhether it is based on rational evidence or not—is inherently “oppressive.” Tothe multiculturalist, to evaluate is to tyrannize.Here is another example from the Smith College flyer:“Lookism”—which is defined as: “the construction of a standard forbeauty/attractiveness; and oppression through stereotypes and generalizations ofboth those who do not fit the standard and those who do.”9[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en69]A stereotype, which is an oversimplified, and hence false, generalization, isprecisely what “lookism” is not objecting to. Stereotyping would entail, forexample, the belief that all beautiful people are successful and happy. Thefalsity of some stereotype, however, is not grounds for attacking generalizationitself—which “lookism” does. There are many valid generalizations about“beauty,” such as: “Beauty is preferable to ugliness.” And that is exactly thekind of generalization multiculturalism wants to suppress. For that is anevaluation, which follows from the judgment of beauty as something good, whichitself follows from the identification of a standard of value. Whatmulticulturalism fundamentally opposes is a standard—any standard—by which somethings are recognized as values and others as non-values.This virulence fully erupts in a third neologism listed in the manifesto:“Ableism”—which is the “oppression of the differently abled, by the temporarilyabled.”10 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en70]This term encompasses all human capacities—physical, intellectual, moral. Itreflects the wish to nullify any rational basis for judging, and thus fordistinguishing among, human beings. It is a wholesale onslaught against themeans by which man achieves his ends, and against the ends themselves.If it is “oppression” to discriminate between those having a particular abilityand those lacking it, then indeed—as multiculturalists demand—sportscompetitions should not be restricted to the athletically able, nor collegediplomas to the alphabetically able. No “discriminatory” standards, then, shouldever be applied. Mortgage loans should not be reserved for those with a means ofrepaying them; driver’s licenses should not be issued only to the sighted;burial plots should not be limited to the dead. Indeed, isn’t the veryevaluation of life over death an insensitive prejudice—the prejudice of“lifeism”? Who, after all, is morally entitled to decide that being among the“temporarily existing” is preferable to joining the “differently existing”? This antipathy to values is why the concept “racism” has come to be perverted bymulticulturalism. Objectively, this term refers to the (false) belief that anindividual’s character is determined by his racial lineage. Multiculturalists,however, attach to “racism” a very different content. They define “racism,” notas discrimination on the basis of race, but as discrimination per se. Theydenounce the racist essentially for labeling some people as superior to others;why he does so is immaterial. Discriminating between blacks and whites,according to the multiculturalist, is the same as discriminating betweengeniuses and fools, heroes and villains, creators and killers. All evaluativedistinctions—which means: values as such—are viewed as despotic.To concretize this, consider the import of an incident at the University ofPennsylvania. An undergraduate member of a “diversity education” committee wasconcerned about some aspects of the school’s multicultural program. She sent anote to the administration, in which she expressed a “deep regard for theindividual and my desire to protect the freedoms of all members of society.”11[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en71]This generated an acrimonious response on the part of one universityadministrator. He returned her note, with her word “individual” underlined andwith the following comment from him: “This is a red flag phrase today, which isconsidered by many to be racist. Arguments that champion the individual over thegroup ultimately privilege the ‘individuals’ belonging to the largest ordominant group.”12 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en72] (Emphasis added.)By any rational analysis, racism and individualism entail opposite philosophies.The former evaluates people by the collective attribute of race; the latter,according to each person’s own characteristics. Why, then, wouldmulticulturalism equate the two? Because they both evaluate-i.e., theydifferentiate some people from others based on some standard. The fact thatracism rests on an irrational standard, while individualism rests on a rationalone, is meaningless to the multiculturalist. To him, the very use of standardsis anathema.An egalitarian leveler does not raise a drug-besotted bum into a moral ideal. Hehas no moral ideal. His defense of the non-ambitious and non-productive is merewindow-dressing for his real motive: the desire to squash the productive and theambitious—a desire he pursues by insisting that we not discriminate between theproductive and the non-productive, and that a bum and a Bill Gates shouldtherefore enjoy equal comforts in life.The egalitarian is far worse than, say, the devout religionist who condemns therich. For the latter is upholding an alternate set of values, albeit anirrational one. He calls for the forswearing of wealth because he believes inthe supreme value of a non-material, supernatural dimension. Egalitarianism,however, is a lower species of irrationalism. It is stark nihilism. It reveresno values—it seeks only the destruction of values. It promotes a leveling forthe sake of leveling, an eradication of value as an end in itself, or—as AynRand puts it—“a hatred of the good for being the good.”13[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en73]This is the philosophic mantle multiculturalism has donned. Multiculturalistsuphold the primitive not because they believe it to be a superior value—butbecause it is inferior, because it is a non-value. They want to annihilate whatthey regard, not as evil—but as good. They do not embrace a standard of valueaccording to which ugliness and disability are esteemed. The multiculturalistesteems nothing. He does not love non-beauty and non-ability; he is moved onlyby a hatred for the beautiful and the able. He wants to exterminate beauty andability because they are good, because on some level he does grasp theirvalue—but his only response to value is venomous hostility.008 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_008_r1.jpg]This is what underlies the insidious tenet known as “diversity.” This is whatexplains the seeming incongruity between multiculturalism’s repudiation of allvalues and its ardent advocacy, as an unquestioned absolute, of the value of“diversity.”Why would anyone consider “diversity” a value? While there are many contexts inwhich it can be desirable, it is never a rational goal in and of itself. One canargue, for example, that diversifying one’s investments is good, so that risk isminimized. But the premise is not that diversity as such is better thannon-diversity; it is that diversified investments are better thannon-diversified ones (which premise itself rests on the value of investment, offinancial security, of wealth, etc.).But how could “diversity” per se be good, irrespective of what is beingdiversified? Is unimpaired health, for example, a shortcoming, which should be“diversified” by exposure to disease? Is knowledge to be “balanced” byignorance? Or sanity by periodic bouts of madness? What, then, is the meaning ofthe crusade for “diversity”?Its supporters claim that the purpose of “diversity” is to provide the antidoteto policies of “exclusion.” To understand what they actually want “diversified,”and what they want not to be “excluded,” let us look at the notion of racial“diversity.”Is racial “diversity” being advocated in order to prevent the racist exclusionof minorities from some sphere? Clearly not. For if it were, multiculturalistswould become instant champions of merit. If their goal in the workplace, forinstance, were to keep employers from discriminating on the basis of skin color,multiculturalists would insist that every employee be judged solely by hisqualifications. They would excoriate any company that granted any importance torace. They would not care what percentage of which race was “represented”anywhere. They would unhesitatingly endorse the hiring of a qualified white overa less qualified black. They would regard race as irrelevant. And they wouldrealize that the only way to ensure that it never becomes relevant is to adhereto a rigorous standard of merit.But multiculturalists do not want race to be irrelevant. Instead, they call fora “diversity” in which race is the salient consideration. They demand thatcertain quotas of minorities be employed. And if those hired by this method arenot sufficiently qualified—well, they say, the need for racial “diversity” isparamount.But why? For decades the liberals fought to have race ignored. “Color-blindness”was their professed ideal. They denounced those who judged any member of aminority not by his objectively important characteristics, but by theunimportant one of race. Yet now, while they aver that no race is superior toanother, they are more obsessed with skin color than any redneck racist. Why?The answer is: precisely because race is unimportant—i.e., because it is anon-value.A policy of disregarding race and of evaluating each individual according to hisabilities is unacceptable to multiculturalists. A company that eschews all formsof racial discrimination does not elicit praise from them. To the contrary, ifit does not actively recruit personnel based on race—if it is “color-blind” andhires only by merit——it elicits antagonism. Such a company is admonished toadopt a “diversity” program and to meet some arbitrary ethnic quota.But if a workforce has been assembled by ignoring race and by hiring onlyqualified people, there is just one way to “diversify” it: by using unqualified(or less qualified) people. If the best-qualified individuals available havebeen hired, then substituting employees of a particular race is likesubstituting employees of a particular eye color or ear length. It can be doneonly by hiring the less competent. What is being counteracted and “diversified,”therefore, is the standard of judging workers. That standard—the standard ofobjective qualifications- is being “balanced” with its opposite. Hiring byability is being “diversified” with hiring by non-ability.In the 1970s, liberals began pushing for “affirmative action” for racialminorities. Because blacks were portrayed as lacking—lacking education, lackingjobs, lacking wealth—society was told to sacrifice for their sake by giving thempreferential treatment in various areas. It was the sheer fact of their need,not any positive value they possessed, that formed the basis for such treatment.But even then, the liberals did not explicitly disavow a standard of value.Rather, they claimed that “affirmative action” would enable the “disadvantaged”eventually to meet a rational standard. By getting a preferential boost, theargument went, minorities would acquire the same values that the “advantaged”whites held—i.e., they would gradually attain the same abilities, pass the sametests, perform the same work and thus enjoy the same rewards.Today’s “diversity” doctrine, however, repudiates even that tenuous link tovalues. Now, the very premise that ability should be the standard by whichworkers are judged is condemned as “exclusionary” and “racist.” Now, it islabeled “ableism.” Now, the contention is that blacks should be preferentiallyhired, not to help them meet a job’s objective standards, but as a means ofdefying the standards themselves.Why—the multiculturalist demands—should blacks adopt the standards of whites?Why should grades rather than ethnic heritage determine who graduates? Why is anapplicant’s performance on an employment test better grounds for being hiredthan his “street smarts”? Why is English better than “Ebonics”? Why should thecorporate world regard a computer programmer as better than someone who caninterpret the messages of ancient tomtom drums? There is no “better,”multiculturalists assert—there is only “diversity.”It is unquestionably true that to espouse a standard of value is to be“exclusionary”: it is to exclude the non-valuable. Any yardstick debars whateverfails to measure up. To hire according to ability is to reject the incompetent.This, not racial discrimination, is the only type of “exclusion”multiculturalism wants to do away with.And that requires doing away with standards as such. The “diversity” or“balance” multiculturalists uphold, therefore, is one between a standard ofvalue and a non-standard—between a standard and an anti-standard. Since they,unlike earlier racists, do not regard one race as better than another, they arenot offering the characteristic of race as an alternative standard. Race isself-avowedly unimportant to the multiculturalist. It is a non-value, servingonly to undercut standards. Those who use it are saying, in effect: “Whyrestrict employment or college admissions to those who meet a standard of value?Why not entirely transcend standards by ‘diversifying’?”The only motive for elevating a non-value is to nullify a real value. Theexponents of racial “diversity” are not seeking a mixture of races achievedwithin a context of objective justice and of rational evaluation; justice andrationality are mercilessly anti-egalitarian and anti-“diversity.” Instead, thegoal is a “diversity” of justice and injustice, of rationality andirrationality, of judging by ability and judging by race.The “diversity” dictum, therefore, means that people are to be “evaluated”according to a non-value. It means that the standard of ability is no betterthan the non-standard of race. It means that people are to be hired not becausethey are able, nor because they will become able, but because the able must be“diversified” with the non-able. It means that the qualified and theunqualified—those who offer some human value and those who do not—are never tobe differentiated. That is the mixture mandated by “diversity.”Thus, we now have the United States Defense Department issuing an employmentpolicy stating that “in the future special permission will be required for thepromotion of all white men without disabilities.” And we have the FederalAviation Administration giving its supervisors the guideline that “the meritpromotion process ... need not be utilized if it will not promote your‘diversity’ goals.”14 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en74]Promote people because they are disabled—promote them because they have nomerit—promote them not for what they possess but for what they lack. Uphold ananti-value, precisely because it negates genuine values. That is themulticultural catechism. Ability must be “diversified” with non-ability, andthose who have no value to offer—those who have only disvalues to offer—must notbe “excluded.” So if an applicant is rejected on the grounds that he does notmeet the standard of ability, he is being wrongly “excluded,” according tomulticulturalists; but if someone who does meet that standard is rejected on thegrounds that he fails to meet the non-standard of race, he is being rightlydismissed as an obstacle to “diversity.”This is why “diversity” is invoked always to undercut some value, never tostrengthen it. “Diversity” is appealed to, for example, as an argument forschools to devote more attention to the “linguistically challenged”; it is neverused to justify more classes for the academically gifted, so that schools might“diversify” upwards rather than downwards. There is never any clamor on campusesto “diversify” the orthodoxy of “political correctness” with viewpoints thatcategorically oppose, say, feminism or affirmative action. (To say nothing ofthe deathly silence about “diversifying” the anti-reason, anti-egoism curriculain philosophy departments with the ideas of, say, Objectivism.) Such proposalsare nonexistent because “diversity” means: destroying the valuable byincorporating the non-valuable.Racial minorities are merely convenient pawns in this egalitarian campaign. Theyhave been defined by liberal propaganda as permanent, helpless deficients. Theyhave been unjustly made into proxies for the hopeless and the unable—proxies forthe absence of value—which reinforces the multicultural claim that to judgepeople according to their objective value is inherently to exclude blacks. Themulticulturalists want the public to believe that without “diversity” quotas,minorities will fail. (And thus the many capable, independent, successfulblacks—who happen to be the greatest victims of “diversity”—hold no interest forthe left, which pretends they do not exist.)The demands of “diversity” now extend well beyond race. From condemning therules of grammar for being intolerant of “linguistic diversity” to mandating theinclusion of mutes in oratory contests, the multiculturalist declares: do not“discriminate.” Standards, he cries, are “Eurocentric” chains of oppression,while “diversity” is liberation. Liberation from what? From reality’s insistencethat value is in fact better than non-value. This philosophy underlies the strange meaning multiculturalists attach to theterm “culture.” The characteristics by which they group people—e.g., race,language, ancestry—are ones that can be important only to the crudest, mostprimitive, tribal mentality. To any rational individual, these characteristicsare insignificant—which, again, is exactly why they are selected. They areperversely designated as defining characteristics of some group because theylack value. And to magnify the perversion, they are said to constitute“cultures.”A genuine culture represents the ideas and values that a particular group ofpeople has chosen. Whether it is the most advanced, technologically drivencivilization, whose achievements are consciously and enthusiastically embracedby members of that society—or the most stagnant, tradition-mired tribe, whosemembers slavishly follow the choices of their ancestors—a culture is avolitional product. A culture is that which people have chosen and whichinfluences their basic way of life.But multiculturalism deliberately highlights that which is unchosen and whichhas virtually no influence on a people’s way of life. It focuses on two aspectsof man: on purely physiological traits (such as race and gender) and on randomcharacteristics that are readily interchangeable with one another (such as one’slanguage being French rather than English, or one’s address being in Serbiarather than in Croatia). The physiological traits are those that no one has anychoice over; the others consist of those that no reasonable individual woulddeem important enough to bother making a choice over. But to themulticulturalist, the less authentic value some attribute has for a group ofpeople, the more it defines a “culture.”The irrationality of old-fashioned racism pales before that of multiculturalism,which holds that there are separate “cultures” of blacks, of Hispanics, of gays,of the handicapped—characteristics that are distinctive by virtue of their beingnon-values that are (supposedly) non-chosen. (Which is, incidentally, whytoday’s left is so insistent that homosexuality is beyond anyone’s choice; therewould be no officially sanctioned “gay culture” if that orientation were seen asvolitional.)The multiculturalist designates the unchosen as the core of your identity.Concomitantly, he belittles that which actually shapes your character andvalues: the volitional—which means, fundamentally: your faculty of thinking.Individual thought is a myth, says the multiculturalist. Your ideas are simplypart of your unchosen ethnic makeup. Like every collectivist, themulticulturalist subscribes to a (subjectivist) version of determinism. Hebelieves that each “culture”—i.e., each ethnic tribe—has a unique mental contentshared by, and only by, the members of that tribe. He ethnicizes all ideas bydogmatically labeling them as: black principles of science, women’s theories oflaw, gay musicology, white interpretations of history, etc.The most glorious cultural accomplishments are cavalierly disvalued bymulticulturalism. From the Greeks’ cultivation of reason and happiness, to theEnlightenment’s development of science and individual freedom, to the IndustrialRevolution’s mastery of nature through technology and entrepreneurship—across arange of discoveries and inventions providing inestimable value to everyrational individual, of any race, color, and gender—the multiculturalist’sscornful response is: “These are the products of white European males, and soare irrelevant to the concerns of non-whites, non-Europeans, and non-males.”While multiculturalists are obviously collectivists, they are different in onesignificant respect from other versions of collectivism: they are also modernegalitarians.Egalitarianism is the doctrine that openly demands a leveling of all men, sothat no one may enjoy anything that others lack. Wealth, brains, talent,looks—whatever the value is, no one may benefit from it unless all do soidentically. As Ayn Rand describes it, egalitarians seek “not political, butmetaphysical equality—the equality of personal attributes and virtues,regardless of natural endowment or individual choice, performance andcharacter.”15 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en75]Multiculturalists zealously endorse this philosophy. They realize that there canbe no metaphysical equality based on values. They know there can be an equalityonly of non-values—an equality obtained by cutting down whoever tries to rise.And they implement this process of leveling in two stages.First, they demand that the individual surrender his identity to his ethnictribe. This crushes all legitimate self-value. Then, to eradicate even any senseof pseudo-value men might acquire through tribal membership, they demand thatone collective sacrifice itself to another—that any tribe of “haves” immolateitself for the sake of any tribe of “have-nots.”Thus, if white males constitute a non-egalitarian proportion of corporate CEOs,or if Asians make up a non-egalitarian ratio of university students, theirinterests must be sacrificed to those of other “cultures.” The non-whites or thenon-Asians are the recipients of these benefits, not because they embody anyvalue—but because they don’t, and because the code of diversity allows nodiscrimination between a value and a non-value. Special preference is given tothose “cultures” whose workers do not deserve promotion, or whose students donot deserve admission, because they don’t deserve it. Multiculturalists, inother words, do not claim that any distinctive group represents the good.This is a major departure from the views of earlier collectivists. Marx, forexample, maintained that while the individual was nothing, the proletariat washistory’s noble embodiment of the good. Hitler told his followers to obliteratetheir egos for the sake of the Aryan collective—which, he said, personified thehuman ideal. The earlier racists in America’s South held whites to be morallyand intellectually superior to blacks. All these collectivists held some groupas the standard of value.Multiculturalism, however, is a full-scale renunciation of value. It is thefirst ideology to overtly weld egalitarianism and collectivism. It is adamantlycollectivist—while eschewing the claim that any collective is genuinely betterthan any other. It believes that the individual has no value—and neither doesany group (to which he must subordinate himself).(This is what led the University of Pennsylvania official to make such a bizarrecriticism of individualism. Leaving aside his inability to think in terms ofanything other than groups, he recognized that under individualism, the“dominant [i.e., objectively better] group” triumphs, while undercollectivism—an egalitarian collectivism—the better is sacrificed to the worse.)Some may regard it as paradoxical that multiculturalism proclaims this universalequality of all “cultures,” while simultaneously invoking special privileges forcertain groups. Some even conclude that the egalitarianism is merely a facade,which enables its proponents to further the interests of the specific groupsthey favor.This is a grave error. In fact, the call for “equality” and the call for“preferential treatment” are the same thing.Egalitarianism wants to level everyone, which means: to drag the best down tothe status of the worst. It contends that the hard-working individual is notentitled to a more enjoyable life than that of the irresponsible moocher.Society must treat the two identically. How? By rewarding the parasite andpenalizing the producer, until the inequalities are eliminated. Both parties aresubject to the same egalitarian principle: namely, that the “haves” ought to bedrained until universal equality—i.e., universal “have-not-ism” —is attained. Ifthe rational and the irrational are to be treated alike, this means that thelatter must be given objectively “preferential” treatment.And that is multiculturalism’s goal. It consistently demands that values be“diversified” with non-values. It promotes “preferential treatment” for certain“cultures”—not for those it regards as superior, but for those that do not meetany standard of value, so that they become “equal” to those that do.This is what makes multiculturalism far more radical, and more consistent, thanold-style cultural relativism. The relativists held that each society isentitled to concoct its own standard of value. Despite this false notion,however, they still believed that values, once concocted, are to be pursued andnon-values shunned. They held that whatever a culture chooses is “good” for thatculture, and should therefore be defended by that culture. Multiculturalists, bycontrast, renounce the very idea of “good”—even a subjective notion of it. Theypreach, not a moral equivalence of everything and everyone, but a militantlyamoral equivalence—i.e., a system under which a value is never to be deemedpreferable to a non-value.The nihilistic view of “culture” and “identity”—as defined by unchosen andinsignificant attributes—is the means by which multiculturalism fully severs anyconnection between man and value. The greater its incongruity with authentic,rational values, the more a “culture” is extolled, and the more each individualis urged to efface himself within it. The meaning and the essence ofmulticulturalism is the worship of anti-values—of that which is patentlyinimical to human life.There is no clearer, or more loathsome, illustration of this than the ongoingcontroversy about a cure for deafness.Deafness is a terrible curse, particularly when the victim is a child. Deafnessimposes upon children a world in which the learning of language—the tool ofconceptual thought—is agonizingly difficult. But medicine has recently developeda surgical procedure, called a cochlear implant, to restore hearing in many deafchildren. This operation represents an incalculable, life-saving blessing. It isa breakthrough that any parent of a deaf child should passionately embrace.Yet there is organized opposition to it—among the deaf.The National Association of the Deaf has denounced the procedure as “invasivesurgery on defenseless children.” As described in The New York Times: “Leadingadvocates of the deaf say it is brutal to open a child’s skull and wind wiresthrough the inner ear, or cochlear, just to rob that child of a birthright ofsilence.” 16 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en76]The editor of Silent News, a periodical published for the deaf, says: “I thinkit is wrong for a hearing parent to deny a deaf child his cultural identity andforce him to be hearing.”17 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en77]An article in The Atlantic explains the metaphysics of this viewpoint: “Deafnessis not a disability. Instead, many deaf people now proclaim, they are asubculture like any other. They are simply a linguistic minority (speakingAmerican Sign Language) and are no more in need of a cure for their conditionthan are Haitians or Hispanics.”18 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en78]That article is titled: “Deafness as Culture.”Here is the full flowering, and full evil, of the multiculturalist philosophy.Here is a naked assault on the irreplaceable value of hearing—on the groundsthat anti-value requires cultural preservation.The multiculturalist bristles at the idea that it is better to be able to hearthan not. That idea is a manifestation of oppression, he asserts. Hearing anddeafness, he says, are merely characteristics of two different “cultures”—and“different” can never imply “better.” So if a hearing person is not consideredto be malfunctioning, if he is not a candidate for corrective surgery—why, then,should the deaf person be? Performing this implant, the multiculturalistdeclares, is discriminatory. It is a repudiation of deaf culture and of what oneauthor hails as “deaf pride.” It is “ableism.” It is, perhaps, “audioism.” Afterall, why should the capacity to hear be universally valued? Why shouldn’t therebe auditory “diversity” among people?As the editors of Deaf Life magazine explain this: “An implant is the ultimatedenial of deafness, the ultimate refusal to let deaf children be Deaf.”19[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en79] This is precisely correct. The implantis a medical denial that deafness is incurable, and a moral denial that deafnessis desirable. But the “culturalists” of the deaf prefer to cling to theirillness. Deafness, they have been taught, is their cultural birthright. It iswhat defines their identity, in conservation of which theywillingly—enthusiastically—consign innocent children to the horrors of alifetime of deafness.And to compound this depravity, the deaf are then urged to take pride in theirpathology. In an unspeakable act of corruption, deaf children are exhorted totake pride, not in their ability to overcome their handicap, but in theirrefusal to overcome it—in their wish to remain stricken—in their desire tovenerate deafness —in their enshrinement of disability qua disability—in theirgrotesque devotion to the multicultural dogma that hearing cannot be superior todeafness. The goal of multiculturalism is to undermine all values, and all aspiration tovalues. Not to improve the plight of minorities, or the uneducated or thedeaf—but to bring everyone down, majority and minority, intelligent andignorant, healthy and sick alike, in fervent pursuit of “non-discrimination”between that which sustains human life and that which does not.But the target of multiculturalism’s nihilism goes beyond evaluation. It extendsto the root of evaluation: cognition itself. The multiculturalist attacks notjust values, but the means of knowing any value—of knowing anything. On the verysame grounds of ethnic egalitarianism, he allows no epistemologicaldiscrimination between logic and illogic, between reason and mysticism. Instead,he says, these alternatives represent nothing more than ... “ethnicpreferences.”This is the deeper meaning of multiculturalism’s belief in ethnic determinism.Each “culture” is said to have its unique method of mental functioning. Adoptingthe basic premise of Marx’s and Hitler’s “polylogism,” multiculturalistsinterpret a commitment to reason and to objectivity as merely a white maleprejudice.“Nothing that passes through the human mind doesn’t have its origin in sexual,economic and racial differentiae,” says a professor at Duke University. 20[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en80] Scientific inquiry is dismissed byfeminists as a “male way of knowing,” and Isaac Newton’s epochal work,Principia, is denounced by them as a “rape manual.”21[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en81] Various “feminist scholarshipguidelines,” established by New Jersey for its schools, reveal the currentgender-perspective on science: “[M]ind was male. Nature was female, andknowledge was created as an act of aggression—a passive nature had to beinterrogated, unclothed, penetrated, and compelled by man to reveal hersecrets.”22 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en82]The very pursuit of knowledge is now derided as “logophallocentrism.” Or, asfeminist theorist Catherine MacKinnon succinctly, and graphically, puts it: “Toknow has meant to fuck.”23 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en83]For generations philosophers have taught that logic is impotent and rational mana myth: multiculturalists are simply exploiting the resultant epistemologicalconfusion. The practical goal of their crude “ethnicizing” of thought is thesame as that of all attempts to “persuade” the public that reason is unreliable:to sap people’s will to fight irrationality—the irrationality that the“persuaders” then feel free to perpetrate.Why don’t people rise up in righteous indignation against racial quotas and“ethnomathematics” and the exaltation of deafness in children? Why is suchsenselessness allowed to persist? Only because people have been intellectuallydisarmed. They have been told that dismissing multiculturalism as senselessreflects an “ethnocentric” bias toward reason. While most people do not agreewith such tripe, they have no answer to it—their philosophers have refused togive them answers—and so they are helpless. They will despair, but they will notfight.In the face of this intellectual pacifism, multiculturalism is able to mount itsdistinctive assault on reason. Its stratagem comprises two lines of actionwhich, at first, seem self-contradictory. On the one hand, multiculturalismemphasizes differences, such as racial ones. Indeed it revels in them, zealouslydividing people all the way down to sub-sub-sub-ethnicities. On the other hand,it vehemently refuses to acknowledge differences, such as those between the deafand the hearing, or the qualified and the unqualified. It condemns as“exclusionary” any attempt to focus on human differences.This apparent anomaly, however, represents a consistent viewpoint. It reflectsthe multiculturalist’s desire to revert to a preconceptual stage. Thedifferences that he accepts—e.g., those of race and gender—are ones that areknown on a purely perceptual level. As long as he can regard suchcharacteristics as narrow, brute facts, he approvingly acknowledges differencesamong people. What he disparages, however, are conceptual differentiations.That is, the multiculturalist is quite willing to discriminate perceptually—asan animal does—between the sheer facts of, say, hearing and not hearing a sound.What he opposes is conceptually identifying those two facts—i.e., abstractingwhat is essential about them, relating them to other relevant knowledge,understanding the causes and consequences of each fact, judging that man’s lifeis greatly expanded by the ability to hear and, most crucially, making thenormative differentiation that hearing is therefore good and deafness bad.The volitional act of evaluation is possible only to a conceptual mind; to aperceptual mentality, there are just raw, disconnected data. “Different, notbetter” is the rallying cry of the concrete-bound mind. It is the cry of themulticulturalist, who first ejects conceptualization from humanconsciousness—and then eliminates evaluation from human life.The multiculturalist aggressively celebrates perceptual differences among peoplebecause they are pivotal to his purpose: dividing mankind into various tribes.To the multiculturalist, each one of the brute differences he observes—blackskin/white skin, male bodies/female bodies—constitutes a tribe, or a herd, or a“culture.”The garden-variety altruist says: “We are all brothers, and each of us is ourbrother’s keeper”; the multiculturalist adapts this by saying: “We are allprimitive tribalists, and each of us is our tribe’s keeper.” He wants people toexult in their tribal differences, in their being black or gay or deaf. This ishow the individual is made a slave to his tribe. The black teenager, forexample, is told to avoid studying hard at school because that would amount to“thinking white.” The deaf child is told to surrender any chance at hearing,because that would betray his “culture of deafness.” Those who engage incampaigns to find remedies for disabilities—such as actor Christopher Reeve, whosuffers from a spinal-injury paralysis—are damned (as “offensive to people whohave learned to live with their disabilities”) and pitied (“I feel sorry for[Reeve] because he wants to be cured”) by a growing horde of “disabilityactivists.”24 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en84]This is how multiculturalists seek to render the individual nonexistent. Theywant to establish the tribe as the moral lawgiver—the tribe as the exacter ofsacrifices—the tribe as the shaper of one’s identity—the tribe as the primaryunit of reality. There are no individuals, multiculturalism insists—there isonly the tribal organism, of which each man is an interchangeable, dispensablecell.All “cultural” differences are to be kept inviolate, according tomulticulturalists—which means that tribalism, which they hail as “diversity,” isto be eternally preserved. They want each tribe to wallow mindlessly in thecrude characteristics that set it apart from other tribes—without beinginstructed that some alternative is better. They know that to convey such anevaluation would be to destroy the tribal identity. They know that to hold suchan evaluation is to urge the deaf to try to become hearing, the ugly to becomeattractive, the illiterate to become literate. It is to tell them that theirtribal designations should be repudiated, and that each individual ought topursue his own, rational values.This is what the multiculturalist rabidly resists. “Don’t tell me about good andbad,” he cries. “I just want to preserve my tribe’s special differences. Whyshould everyone strive to hear and to be handsome and literate and able—thatwould be anti-diversity.”This is unadulterated egalitarianism—upheld as a means of embalming tribaldifferences. It is egalitarianism, designed to perpetuate a life of stagnationand to ratify the inertia of a consciousness that dreads escaping fromcollective bondage. It is egalitarianism, sought by those who recoil, in terror,from the prospect of assuming responsibility for questioning tribal customs andfor thinking and living independently. It is egalitarianism, cherished by thosewho have no desire to make their lives any better because they cling to thebelief that the very idea of “better” is oppressive.If, however, each tribe is to be lauded for its distinctive primitiveness, thenthis calcified mentality feels safe. Then—since those differences are not to beconceptually processed and evaluated, and since the need for “diversity” forbidsdenying to one group what any others have—all will be granted the “security” ofuniversal, tribal “equality”: the same graduation rates, the same income levels,the same number of cochlear implants.Because multiculturalism wants to invalidate the rational mind, it denouncesconceptual discriminations among people. Whenever one judges that, in a givencontext, essential differences exist that the elderly are different from theyoung, that the competent are different from the incompetent, that human beingsare different from animals---one is condemned as an “ageist,” an “ableist,” a“speciesist.” There is an unending litany of such egalitarian “anti-concepts”25[rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#en85] to describe virtually any act ofcognitive discrimination.Multiculturalists refuse to distinguish the essential from the non-essential.They refuse to grasp that, say, men and women ought to be treated as essentiallydifferent in some contexts—e.g., with respect to romantic love or clothingdesign—and as essentially similar in other—e.g., with respect to theirintellectual capacity or their ability to drive a car. The multiculturalistrefuses to understand that the deaf are essentially different from others whenit comes to, say, ability to communicate and essentially similar when it comesto, say, possession of political rights.To a mind frozen on the perceptual level, there are no essential, as againstnon-essential, characteristics. The stunted multicultural mentality sees only aproliferation of tribal traits and asks only one question: are all tribes beingtreated identically or are some being “discriminated” against?Because values are based on facts, this egalitarianism is ultimately not moral,but epistemological. It espouses a certain cognitive approach to reality—anapproach that abjures conceptual discriminations between essentially differentthings. The diversity doctrine, by advocating non-discrimination between valueand non-value, is simply an application of this wider anti-conceptual premise.By keeping man’s consciousness on the level of an animal’s, multiculturalismaborts the cognitive means of making such a distinction.Multiculturalism wants to drag man back to a primitive mode of functioning. Itis an ideology intended to make man into a barbarian—mentally and therebyexistentially. If fully adopted, this can mean only one thing in practice:full-scale tribal warfare, leading to wholesale extermination that would surpassHitler’s wildest longings.When ethnic subjectivism reigns, there can be no other result—and no otherpurpose. If there are no objective truths and no objective methods fordiscovering them—if reasons, arguments, and logic are “cultural biases”—then allhuman interaction reduces ultimately to the wishes, and the weapons, of onetribe versus those of another.On any matter, then, the only relevant consideration becomes the identities ofthe tribes involved. If you apply for admission into college, you will be asked:Which tribe are you from and how many of that tribe have already been accepted?If you present the most eloquent arguments in support of your ideas, you will beasked: To which tribe do you belong and which tribes are affected by yourbeliefs?Tribalism reduces men to the status of beasts snarling over a piece of meat. Itmakes it impossible for people to deal with one another rationally, particularlywith respect to disagreements and conflicts. If an O.J. Simpson is put on trial,there will be no such thing as objective evidence by which to prove guilt. Therewill be only the perception that a member of one tribe is being prosecuted bythose of another—and only one possible verdict: the tribe regarded asrepresenting the “have-nots” must prevail over the “haves.”The tenets of law and reason, which are products of a conceptual age, will nolonger constrain people. People will act like the pack of animalsmulticulturalism has taught them to become. If a community decides it does notlike a certain jury verdict—or a supermarket’s price of milk—what course ofaction will it pursue? It will see only that one tribe has been aggrieved byanother and will choose violent retribution as its response.Multiculturalism is the abject repudiation of centuries of civilization. Itmarks the retrogression to an existence in which individuals no longer seekindependently—i.e., conceptually—to identify the true and the good, but ratherbecome a swarm of savages, unthinkingly accepting their chieftains’. edicts andceaselessly feeding at one another’s throats. Multiculturalism is paving theroad that leads, in the end, back to the cave. America used to be known by a cogent sobriquet: the melting pot. This named thefact that, when coming to America, immigrants of various nationalities,languages, and ancestries would discard their backgrounds and unite in a commonembrace of freedom. They did so because they understood that freedom wasessential to their lives, while the accidents of their pasts were not. Theygrasped that the values represented by America, not those of their ethnicheritage, constituted their true culture and bound together all who acceptedthem. The melting-pot metaphor represented the principle of integrationpolitically, socially, and epistemologically.Today, this is a “politically incorrect” description of America. Now ourschoolchildren are taught that an “ethnic mosaic” is the proper metaphor.Disintegration has become the guiding premise, and tribal balkanization itslogical manifestation.The antidote to this return to primitivism is a return to the “melting pot”—areturn to a time in which liberty and progress were unobstructed. To be moreprecise, the antidote requires a huge leap forward. It requires a commitment tothe philosophy of individualism, which, tragically, America never fully had,even at the start. It requires the conviction that, in all moral and politicalissues, the individual is the primary unit—that man’s defining characteristic ishis rational mind—that the objective standard of value is man’s life—and that,of all the cognitive discriminations his life necessitates, the one betweenvalue and non-value is the most crucial.If enough voices were to articulate such a philosophy, the phenomenon ofmulticulturalism would quickly vanish. Forced to face the bright, unyieldinglight of reason, it would sink back into the primordial ooze from which itarose.REFERENCES1 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#Ref-en61] “Cortines Vows To Stop Board’s‘America Best’ Plan,” New York Post, June 22, 1994, p. 20.2 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#Ref-en62] Ibid.3 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#Ref-en63] “School Board Will RecognizeOther Cultures, but as Inferior,” New York Times, May 13, 1994, p. 16.4 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#Ref-en64] Claudia Zaslavsky, “IntegratingMathematics with the Study of Cultural Traditions” (paper presented at theInternational Conference of Mathematical Education in Budapest, Hungary, summer1988).5 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_c14_r1.html#Ref-en65] William A.

Acurrent trend proclaims that technology is man’s enemy and should be restrictedor abolished. Let us project what this idea would mean in practice.Suppose that you are a young man in the year 1975. You are married, have twochildren and own a modest home in the suburbs of a large city. Let us observe anormal, average day of your life.You get up at five a.m., because you work in the city and must be at the officeat nine. You always had a light breakfast, just toast and coffee. Your electricpercolator is gone; electric percolators are not manufactured any longer, theyare regarded as an item of self indulgent luxury: they consume electric power,which contributes to the load of power stations, which contributes to airpollution. So you make your coffee in an old-fashioned pot on an electric—no, anoil-burning stove; you used to have an electric one, but they have beenforbidden by law. Your electric toaster is gone; you make your toast in theoven; your attention wanders for a moment and you burn the toast. There is notime to make another batch.When you had a car, it took you three-quarters of an hour to get to the office;but private automobiles have been outlawed and replaced by “masstransportation.” Now it takes you two hours and a half. The community bus canmake the trip in a little over an hour, when it is on time; but you never knowwhether it will be on time, so you allow for half-an-hour’s delay. You trudgeten blocks through the bitter gusts of a cold morning wind to your community busstop, and you stand waiting. You have no choice—there are no other means oftransportation—and you know it; so does the bus company.When you reach the city, you walk twelve blocks from the bus terminal to theoffice building. You make it on time. You work till noon, then eat, at yourdesk, the lunch you have brought from home. There used to be six restaurants inthe two blocks around the building; but restaurants are notorious sources ofpollution—they create garbage; now there is only one restaurant, and it is nottoo good, and you have to stand in line. Besides, you save money by packing yourown lunch. You pack it in an old shoe-box; there are no metal boxes: the miningof metal has been severely curtailed; there are no plastic bags—a self-indulgentluxury; there are no Thermos bottles. Your sandwich is a little stale and yourcoffee is cold, but you are used to that.In the later hours of the afternoon, you begin to watch the clock and to fightagainst the recurring attacks of your enemy: boredom. You have worked for thecompany for eight years; for the past three years, you have been office manager;there is no promotion to expect, no further place to go; business expansion hasbeen arrested. You try to fight the boredom by telling yourself that you are anunusually lucky fellow, but it does not help much. You keep saying it because,under the boredom, there is a nagging fear which you don’t want to acknowledge:that the company might go out of business. You know that paper consumes trees,and trees are essential for the preservation of life on earth, and forests mustnot be sacrificed for the sake of self-indulgent luxuries. The company you workfor manufactures paper containers.By the time you reach the bus terminal again, on your way home, you reproachyourself for being exhausted; you see no reason for it. Your wife—you keeptelling yourself—is the real victim. And she is.Your wife gets up at six a.m.—you have insisted that she sleep until the coalfurnace, which you lighted, has warmed the house a little. She has to cookbreakfast for your son, aged 5; there are no breakfast cereals to give him, theyhave been prohibited as not sufficiently nutritious; there is no canned orangejuice—cans pollute the countryside. There are no electric refrigerators.She has to breast-feed your infant daughter, aged six months; there are noplastic bottles, no baby formulas. There are no products such as “Pampers”; yourwife washes diapers for hours each day, by hand, as she washes all the familylaundry, as she washes the dishes—there are no self-indulgent luxuries such aswashing machines or automatic dishwashers or electric irons. There are no vacuumcleaners; she cleans the house by means of a broom.There are no shopping centers—they despoil the beauty of the countryside. Shewalks two miles to the nearest grocery store and stands in line for an hour orso. The purchases she lugs home are a little heavy; but she does notcomplain—the lady columnist in the newspaper has said it is good for her figure.Since there are no canned foods and no frozen foods, she starts cooking dinnerthree hours in advance, peeling and slicing by hand every slimy, recalcitrantbit of the vegetables. She does not get fruit very often—refrigerated freightcars have been discontinued.When you get home, she is trying not to show that she is exhausted. It is prettydifficult to hide, particularly since there are no cosmetics—which are anextra-self-indulgent luxury. By the time you are through with dinner anddishwashing and putting the children to bed and a few other chores, you are bothfree. But what are you to do with your brief evening? There is no television, noradio, no electric phonograph, no recorded music. There are no drive-in movies.There is a movie theater in a town six miles away—if you catch the community busin time. You don’t feel like rushing to catch it.So you stay at home. You find nothing to say to your wife: you don’t want todepress her by discussing the kinds of things that crowd your mind. You knowthat she is keeping silent for the same reason. Junior did not eat much dinner:he has a sore throat; you remember vaguely that diphtheria had once beenvirtually eliminated, but epidemics of it have been recurring recently inschools around the country; seventy-three children died of it in a neighboringstate. The last time you saw your father, he complained about pains in hischest; you hope desperately that it is not a heart ailment. Your mother died ofa heart ailment at the age of fifty-five; the old doctor mentioned a device thatcould have saved her, but it was a product of a very, very advanced technology,which does not exist any longer: it was called a “pacemaker.”You look at your wife; the light is dim—electricity is rationed and only onebulb per room is allowed—but you can see the slump of her shoulders and thelines at the corners of her mouth. She is only thirty-two; she was such abeautiful girl when you met her in college. She was studying to be a lawyer; shecould have combined a career with the duties of a wife and mother; but she couldnot combine it with the duties of heavy industry; so she gave it up. In thefifteen hours of this day, she has done the work of a dozen machines. She hashad to do it—so that the brown pelican or the white polar bear might not vanishfrom this earth.By ten o’clock, you feel a desperate longing for sleep—and cannot summon anyother desire. Lying in bed, by the side of your wife who feels as you do, youwonder dimly what it was that the advocates of a return to nature had beensaying about the joys of an unrestrained sexuality; you cannot remember it anylonger. As you fall asleep, the air is pure above the roof of your house, pureas arctic snow—only you wonder how much longer you will care to breathe it. This, of course, is fiction.In real life, there is no such thing as a gradual descent from civilization tosavagery. There is a crash—and no recovery, only the long, drawn-out agony ofchaos, helplessness and random death, on a mass scale. There is no such thing asretrogressing “a little.” There is no such thing as a “restrained progress.” Youare hearing many voices today that object to an “unrestricted technology.” Arestricted technology is a contradiction in terms.What is not fiction, however, are the countless ways in which your life—and anymeaning, comfort, safety or happiness you may find in life—depends ontechnology. The purpose of the far too brief example I gave you was to promptyou to make a similar, personal inventory of what you would lose if technologywere abolished and then to give a moment’s silent thanks every time you use oneof the labor- and, therefore, time- and, therefore, life-saving devices createdfor you by technology.If someone proposed to reduce you to the state I described, you would scream inprotest. Why don’t you? It is being proposed loudly, clearly and daily allaround you. What is worse, it is being proposed in the name of love for mankind.There are three major reasons why you, and most people, do not protest. (1) Youtake technology—and its magnificent contributions to your iife---for granted,almost as if it were a fact of nature, which will always be there. But it is notand will not. (2) As an American, you are likely to be very benevolent andenormously innocent about the nature of evil. You are unable to believe thatsome people can advocate man’s destruction for the sake of man’s destruction—andwhen you hear them, you think that they don’t mean it. But they do. (3) Youreducation—by that same kind of people—has hampered your ability to translate anabstract idea into its actual, practical meaning and, therefore, has made youindifferent to and contemptuous of ideas. This is the real American tragedy.It is these three premises that you now have to check.The attack on technology is being put over on you by means of a package dealtied together by strings called “ecology.” Let us examine the arguments of theecologists; their motives will become clear as we go along.Under the title “The Ravaged Environment,” a survey of the ecological crusadewas published in Newsweek on January 26, 1970. In spite—or, perhaps, because—ofits sympathy with that crusade, it is an accurate survey: it captures themovement’s essence, spirit and epistemological style.The survey begins by declaring that man “has come face to face with a newman-made peril, the poisoning of his natural environment with noxious doses ofchemicals, garbage, fumes, noise, sewage, heat, ugliness and urbanovercrowding.”Observe the odd disparity of the things listed as perils: noxious chemicals,along with noise and ugliness. This mixture occurs in all the arguments of theecologists; we shall discuss its motives later.The perils—the survey keeps stressing—are not merely local, but global, theyaffect the whole of the earth and threaten the survival of all living species.What kinds of examples are given and on the grounds of what evidence?“In the shallow waters of the Pacific Ocean off Los Angeles, sea urchins—a smallsea animal—are enjoying a population boom, thanks to the organic materials insewage being washed out to sea. Normally, the sea urchins’ population levels aretied to the quantity of kelp on the ocean bottoms; the animals die off when theyhave eaten all the kelp, thus allowing new crops of the seaweed to grow But nowthat the sewage is available to nourish the sea urchins, the kelp beds have nothad a chance to recover. In many places the kelp, for which man has foundhundreds of uses (it is an ingredient of salad dressing and beer) hasdisappeared altogether.“There is, of course, no way of calculating the exact effects of the loss ofkelp on its particular ecosystem.”An “ecosystem” is defined as “the sum total of all the living and non-livingparts that support a chain of life within a selected area.” How do theecologists select this area? How do they determine its interrelationship withthe rest of the globe, and over what period of time? No answer is given.Another example: “Right now some ecologists are worried about the possibleeffect on the Eskimo of the great oil race on Alaska’s remote North Slope. Oilspills in the ever-frozen sea, they fear, would be trapped in the narrow spacebetween water and ice, killing first the plankton, then the fish and mollusksthat feed on the plankton, then the polar bears, walrus, seals and whales thatfeed off sea life, and finally threatening the Eskimos who live off theseanimals.“The net outcome of the current research, hopefully, will be a betterunderstanding of the potential consequences of man’s tampering with anyecosystem.”Consider the actual consequences of this particular example. Without any efforton their part, the Eskimos are to receive fortunes in oil royalties, which willenable them to give up their backbreaking struggle for mere subsistence and todiscover the comfort of civilized life and labor. If—and it is only an “if”—theecologists’ fears came true, the Eskimos would have the means to move to abetter background. Or are we to assume that the Eskimos prefer their way of lifeto ours? If so, why are they entitled to a preference, but we are not? Or shallwe assume that the Eskimos have inalienable rights, but Thomas Edison does not?Or are the Eskimos to be sacrificed to the polar bears, walruses, seals andwhales, which are to be sacrificed to the fish and mollusks, which are to besacrificed to the plankton? If so, why? But we will come back to these questionslater.“Non-human environments,” the survey declares, “have a remarkable resiliency; asmany as 25 or even 50 per cent of a certain fish or rodent population might belost in a habitat during a plague or disaster, yet the species will recover itsoriginal strength within one or two years. It’s man-made interference—orpollution—that can profoundly disturb the ecosystem and its equilibrium.”Bear this in mind: factories represent pollution—plagues do not.“The worst fears of land conservationists concern not the accidental spoilage ofland by wastes, but its exploitation by man to build mines, roads and cities. Intime he may encroach so far on his greenery that he reduces the amount of air hehas to breathe.”Have you ever looked at a map of the globe and compared the size of the area ofindustrial sites and cities to the size of the area of untouched wilderness andprimeval jungles? And what about the greenery cultivated by man? What about thegrains, the fruit trees, the flowers that would have vanished long ago withouthuman care and labor? What about the giant irrigation projects that transformdeserts into fertile, green lands? No answer.“Louisiana’s state bird, the brown pelican, has vanished from its shores,” thesurvey laments, blaming the bird’s extinction on DDT.The dinosaur and its fellow-creatures vanished from this earth long before therewere any industrialists or any men—and environmental “resiliency” never broughtthem back. But this did not end life on earth. Contrary to the ecologists,nature does not stand still and does not maintain the kind of “equilibrium” thatguarantees the survival of any particular species—least of all the survival ofher greatest and most fragile product: man.But love for man is not a characteristic of the ecologists. “Man has always beena messy animal,” the survey declares. “Ancient Romans complained of the sootysmoke that suffused their city, and in the first century Pliny described thedestruction of crops from climate changes wrought by the draining of lakes ordeflection of rivers.”Such events did not occur in the period that followed the fall of Rome: the DarkAges.Would you regard the following as an expression of love for man? This deals withanother alleged pollution created by cities: noise. “Nor can the harried urbaninhabitant seek silence indoors. He merely substitutes the clamor of rock musicfor the beat of the steam hammers, the buzz of the air conditioner for thesteady rumble of traffic. The modern kitchen, with its array of washingmachines, garbage-disposal units and blenders, often rivals the street corner asa source of unwanted sound.”Consider the fate of a human being, a woman, who is to become once again asubstitute for washing machines, garbage-disposal units and blenders. Considerwhat human life and suffering were like, indoors and out, prior to the advent ofair conditioning. The price you pay for these marvelous advantages is “unwantedsound.” Well, there is no unwanted sound in a cemetery.Predictions of universal doom are interspersed with complaints of this kind. Andnowhere, neither in this survey nor elsewhere, does one find any scientificevidence—no, not to prove, but even to support a valid hypothesis of globaldanger. But one does find the following.“... some scientists,” the survey declares, “like to play with the notion thatglobal disaster may result if environmental pollution continues unchecked.According to one scenario, the planet is already well advanced toward aphenomenon called ‘the greenhouse effect.’ Concentrations of carbon dioxide arebuilding up in the atmosphere, it is said, as the world’s vegetation, whichfeeds on CO2, is progressively chopped down. Hanging in the atmosphere, it formsa barrier trapping the planet’s heat. As a result, the greenhouse theoristscontend, the world is threatened with a rise in average temperature which, if itreached 4 or 5 degrees, could melt the polar ice caps, raise sea level by asmuch as 300 feet and cause a worldwide flood. Other scientists see an oppositeperil: that the polar ice will expand, sending glaciers down to the temperatezone once again. This theory assumes that the earth’s cloud cover will continueto thicken as more dust, fumes and water vapor are belched into the atmosphereby industrial smokestacks and jet planes. Screened from the sun’s heat, theplanet will cool, the water vapor will fall and freeze, and a new Ice Age willbe born.”This is what bears the name of “science” today. It is on the basis of this kindof stuff that you are being pushed into a new Dark Age.Now observe that in all the propaganda of the ecologists—amidst all theirappeals to nature and pleas for “harmony with nature” —there is no discussion ofman’s needs and the requirements of his survival. Man is treated as if he werean unnatural phenomenon. Man cannot survive in the kind of state of nature thatthe ecologists envision—i.e., on the level of sea urchins or polar bears. Inthat sense, man is the weakest of animals: he is born naked and unarmed, withoutfangs, claws, horns or “instinctual” knowledge. Physically, he would fall aneasy prey, not only to the higher animals, but also to the lowest bacteria: heis the most complex organism and, in a contest of brute force, extremely fragileand vulnerable. His only weapon his basic means of survival—is his mind.In order to survive, man has to discover and produce everything he needs, whichmeans that he has to alter his background and adapt it to his needs. Nature hasnot equipped him for adapting himself to his background in the manner ofanimals. From the most primitive cultures to the most advanced civilizations,man has had to manufacture things; his well-being depends on his success atproduction. The lowest human tribe cannot survive without that alleged source ofpollution: fire. It is not merely symbolic that fire was the property of thegods which Prometheus brought to man. The ecologists are the new vulturesswarming to extinguish that fire.It is not necessary to remind you of what human existence was like—for centuriesand millennia—prior to the Industrial Revolution. That the ecologists ignore orevade it is so terrible a crime against humanity that it serves as theirprotection: no one believes that anyone can be capable of it. But, in thismatter, it is not even necessary to look at history; take a look at theconditions of existence in the undeveloped countries, which means: on most ofthis earth, with the exception of the blessed island which is Westerncivilization.The wisest words I read on the subject of pollution and ecology were spoken bythe ambassador of one of those countries. At a United Nations symposium, OliverWeerasinghe, ambassador from Ceylon, said: “The two-thirds of mankind who livein developing countries do not share the same concern for the environment as theother one-third in more affluent regions. The primary problem for thesedeveloping areas is the struggle for the bare necessities of life. It would,therefore, not be realistic to expect governments of these areas to carry outrecommendations regarding environmental protection which might impede orrestrict economic progress.” (Industry Week, June 29, 1970. Italics mine.)In Western Europe, in the preindustrial Middle Ages, man’s life expectancy was30 years. In the nineteenth century, Europe’s population grew by 300percent—which is the best proof of the fact that for the first time in humanhistory, industry gave the great masses of people a chance to survive.If it were true that a heavy concentration of industry is destructive to humanlife, one would find life expectancy declining in the more advanced countries.But it has been rising steadily. Here are the figures on life expectancy in theUnited States (from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company):009 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_009_r1.gif]Anyone over 30 years of age today, give a silent “Thank you” to the nearest,grimiest, sootiest smokestacks you can find.No, of course, factories do not have to be grimy—but this is not an issue whenthe survival of technology is at stake. And clean air is not the issue nor thegoal of the ecologists’ crusade.The figures on life expectancy in different countries around the globe are asfollows (from The New York Times Almanac, 1970):010 [rand_9781101137277_oeb_010_r1.gif]If you consider, not merely the length, but the kind of life men have to lead inthe undeveloped parts of the world—“the quality of life,” to borrow, with fullmeaning, the ecologists’ meaningless catch phrase—if you consider the squalor,the misery, the helplessness, the fear, the unspeakably hard labor, thefestering diseases, the plagues, the starvation, you will begin to appreciatethe role of technology in man’s existence.Make no mistake about it: it is technology and progress that the nature-loversare out to destroy. To quote again from the Newsweek survey: “What worriesecologists is that people now upset about the environment may ultimately look totechnology to solve everything ...” This is repeated over and over again;technological solutions, they claim, will merely create new problems.“... a number of today’s environmental reformers conclude that mankind’s mainhope lies not in technology but in abstinence—fewer births and less gadgetry....The West Coast has also spawned a fledgling ‘zero GNP growth’ movement. HarveyWheeler, of Santa Barbara’s Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions,believes the U.S. may reach a point—perhaps in ten years——when ‘the present rateof growth is absolutely disastrous and economic growth may well have to beeliminated altogether.’ ”And: “Russell Train [one of President Nixon’s advisers] warns that improving thequality of life will entail unpopular cutbacks on luxuries. ‘People have shownno inclination,’ he points out, ‘to give up the products of affluence—TV setsand gadgets.’ ”You have probably seen on television, as I have, the younger adherents of theecological crusade, the hippie types who scream, denouncing modern “luxuries,”with special emphasis on the electric toothbrush, which, they claim, contributesto pollution by consuming electricity. Leaving aside the fact that thistoothbrush, as any dentist will tell you, is an extremely valuable tool ofhealth care, because it provides gum massage, let us consider its consumption ofelectricity.An average household light bulb consumes 100 watts of electricity. This bulb isused approximately 8 to 10 hours a day, which means a daily consumption of 800to 1000 watt-hours. Compare this figure with the following: a General ElectricCordless Toothbrush consumes 2 watts of electricity when being recharged.Whatever the motives of those hippies’ attacks, concern for air pollution is notone of them.The immediate—though not the ultimate—motive is made quite clear in the Newsweeksurvey. “To a man they [the ecologists] maintain that a national population planmust be invoked, primarily through a national land-use plan.” “The battleagainst pollution must also overcome the jurisdictional lines that carve theplanet into separate sovereignties.” The ecologists’ programs cannot beaccomplished “without some fairly important modifications of the Americantradition of free enterprise and free choice.” The “obstacles to reform [are]man’s traditional notions of growth, sovereignty, individualism and time.” “Whatis needed, the ecologists suggest, is a rebirth of community spirit, not onlyamong men but among all of nature.” How they intend to impose a “communityspirit” on nature, where living species exist by devouring one another, is notindicated.The immediate goal is obvious: the destruction of the remnants of capitalism intoday’s mixed economy, and the establishment of a global dictatorship. This goaldoes not have to be inferred—many speeches and books on the subject stateexplicitly that the ecological crusade is a means to that end.There are two significant aspects in this New Left switch of the collectivists’line. One is the open break with the intellect, the dropping of the mask ofintellectuality worn by the old left, the substitution of birds, bees andbeauty—“nature’s beauty”—for the pseudoscientific, super-technologicalparaphernalia of Marx’s economic determinism. A more ludicrous shrinking of amovement’s stature or a more obvious confession of intellectual bankruptcy couldnot be invented in fiction.The other significant aspect is the reason behind this switch: the switchrepresents an open admission—by Soviet Russia and its facsimiles around theworld and its sympathizers of every political sort and shade—that collectivismis an industrial and technological failure; that collectivism cannot produce.The root of production is man’s mind; the mind is an attribute of the individualand it does not work under orders, controls and compulsion, as centuries ofstagnation have demonstrated. Progress cannot be planned by government, and itcannot be restricted or retarded; it can only be stopped, as every statistgovernment has demonstrated. If we are to consider nature, what about the factthat collectivism is incompatible with man’s nature and that the firstrequirement of man’s mind is freedom? But observe that just as the ancientmystics of spirit regarded the mind as a faculty of divine origin and,therefore, as unnatural, so today’s mystics of muscle, observing that the mindis not possessed by animals, regard it as unnatural.If concern with poverty and human suffering were the collectivists’ motive, theywould have become champions of capitalism long ago; they would have discoveredthat it is the only political system capable of producing abundance. But theyevaded the evidence as long as they could. When the issue became overwhelminglyclear to the whole world, the collectivists were faced with a choice: eitherturn to the right, in the name of humanity—or to the left, in the name ofdictatorial power. They turned to the left—the New Left.Instead of their old promises that collectivism would create universal abundanceand their denunciations of capitalism for creating poverty, they are nowdenouncing capitalism for creating abundance. Instead of promising comfort andsecurity for everyone, they are now denouncing people for being comfortable andsecure. They are still struggling, however, to inculcate guilt and fear; thesehave always been their psychological tools. Only instead of exhorting you tofeel guilty of exploiting the poor, they are now exhorting you to feel guilty ofexploiting land, air and water. Instead of threatening you with a bloodyrebellion of the disinherited masses, they are now trying—like witch doctorsaddressing a tribe of savages—to scare you out of your wits with thunderouslyvague threats of an unknowable, cosmic cataclysm, threats that cannot bechecked, verified or proved.One element, however, has remained unchanged in the collectivists’ technique,the element without which they would have had no chance: altruism—the appeal forself-sacrifice, the denial of man’s right to exist. But observe the shrinking ofplausibility with the expansion of the scale: some forty years ago, Franklin D.Roosevelt exhorted this country to sacrifice for the sake of an underprivileged“one-third of a nation”; fifteen years later, the sacrifice was stretched toinclude the “underprivileged” of the whole globe; today, you are asked tosacrifice for the sake of seaweeds and inanimate matter.To the credit of the American people, the majority do not take the ecology issueseriously. It is an artificial, PR-manufactured issue, blown up by the bankruptleft who can find no other grounds for attacking capitalism. But the majority,as in so many other issues, remain silent. And this, precisely, is the danger.“The uncontested absurdities of today are the accepted slogans of tomorrow.”They are accepted by default.It is possible, however, that the leftists may have outsmarted themselves, thistime. The issue may be stolen from them and dissolved by American common sense,which may take them at their word, accept the semiplausible bait and reject therest of the ecological package deal.What is the semiplausible bait? The actual instances of local pollution anddirt, which do exist. City smog and filthy rivers are not good for men (thoughthey are not the kind of danger that the ecological panic-mongers proclaim themto be). This is a scientific, technological problem—not a political one—and itcan be solved only by technology. Even if smog were a risk to human life, wemust remember that life in nature, without technology, is wholesale death.As far as the role of government is concerned, there are laws—some of thempassed in the nineteenth century—prohibiting certain kinds of pollution, such asthe dumping of industrial wastes into rivers, These laws have not been enforced.It is the enforcement of such laws that those concerned with the issue mayproperly demand. Specific laws—forbidding specifically defined and proved harm,physical harm, to persons or property—are the only solution to problems of thiskind. But it is not solutions that the leftists are seeking, it is controls.Observe that industry has been made the scapegoat in this issue, as in all modemissues. But industry is not the only culprit; for instance, the handling of thesewage and garbage disposal problems, which is so frequently here denounced, hasbeen the province of the local governments. Yet the nature-lovers scream thatindustry should be abolished, or regulated out of existence, and that more powershould be given to the government. And as far as the visible dirt is concerned,it is not the industrial tycoons who strew beer cans and soda-pop bottles allover the highways of America.Since the enormous weight of controls created by the welfare-state theorists hashampered, burdened, corrupted, but not yet destroyed American industry, thecollectivists have found—in ecology—a new excuse for the creation of morecontrols, more corruption, more favor-peddling, more harassment of industry bymore irresponsible pressure groups.The industrialists, as usual, will be the last to protest. In a mixed economy,the industrialists will swallow anything and apologize for anything. Theirabject crawling and climbing on the “environmental” bandwagon is consistent withtheir policy of the past four or five decades, inculcated by Pragmatism: theywould rather make a deal with a few more bureaucrats than stand up and face theissue in terms of philosophical-moral principles.The greatest guilt of modern industrialists is not the fumes of their factorysmokestacks, but the pollution of this country’s intellectual life, which theyhave condoned, assisted and supported.As to the politicians, they have discovered that the issue of pollution is paydirt and they have gone all out for it. They see it as a safe,non-controversial, “public-spirited” issue, which can mean anything to anyone.Besides, a politician would not dare oppose it and be smeared from coast tocoast as an advocate of smog. All sorts of obscure politicians are leaping intoprominence and onto television screens by proposing “ecological” reforms. A wiseremark on the subject was made by a politician with whom I seldom agree: JesseUnruh of California. He said: “Ecology has become the political substitute forthe word mother.”The deeper significance of the ecological crusade lies in the fact that it doesexpose a profound threat to mankind—though not in the sense its leaders allege.It exposes the ultimate motive of the collectivists—the naked essence of hatredfor achievement, which means: hatred for reason, for man, for life.In today’s drugged orgy of boastfully self-righteous swinish-ness, the masks arecoming down and you can hear all but explicit confessions of that hatred.For example, five years ago, on the occasion of the East Coast’s massive powerfailure and blackout, Life magazine published the following in its issue ofNovember 19, 1965: “It shouldn’t happen every evening, but a crisis like thelights going out has its good points. In the first place, it deflates humansmugness about our miraculous technology, which, at least in the area of powerdistribution and control, now stands revealed as utterly flawed ... and it issomehow delicious to contemplate the fact that all our beautiful brains and allthose wonderful plans and all that marvelous equipment has combined to produce asystem that is unreliable.”Currently, the Newsweek survey criticizes the spectacular progress of the UnitedStates, as follows: “The society’s system of rewards favored the man whoproduced more, who found new ways to exploit nature. There were no riches orprestige for the man who made a deliberate decision to leave well enoughalone—in this case, his environment.” Observe that this “system of rewards” istreated as if it were an arbitrary whim of society, not an inexorable fact ofnature. Who is to provide the riches—or even the minimum sustenance—for the manwho does not choose “to exploit nature”? What is “prestige” to be grantedfor—for non-production and nonachievement? For holding man’s life cheaper thanhis physical environment? When man had to “leave well enough alone”—inprehistoric times—his life expectancy was 15 to 20 years.This phrase, “to leave well enough alone,” captures the essence of the deaf,blind, lethargic, fear-ridden, hatred-eaten human ballast that the men of themind—the prime movers of human survival and progress—have had to drag along, tofeed and to be martyred by, through all the millennia of mankind’s history.The Industrial Revolution was the great breakthrough that liberated man’s mindfrom the weight of that ballast. The country made possible by the IndustrialRevolution—The United States of America—achieved the magnificence which onlyfree men can achieve, and demonstrated that reason is the means, the base, theprecondition of man’s survival.The enemies of reason—the mystics, the man-haters and life-haters, the seekersof the unearned and the unreal—have been gathering their forces for acounterattack, ever since. It was the corruption of philosophy that gave them afoothold and slowly gave them the power to corrupt the rest.The enemies of the Industrial Revolution—its displaced persons were of the kindthat had fought human progress for centuries, by every means available. In theMiddle Ages, their weapon was the fear of God. In the nineteenth century, theystill invoked the fear of God—for instance, they opposed the use of anesthesiaon the grounds that it defies God’s will, since God intended men to suffer. Whenthis weapon wore out, they invoked the will of the collective, the group, thetribe. But since this weapon has collapsed in their hands, they are now reduced,like cornered animals, to baring their teeth and their souls, and to proclaimingthat man has no right to exist—by the divine will of inanimate matter.The demand to “restrict” technology is the demand to restrict man’s mind. It isnature—i.e., reality—that makes both these goals impossible to achieve.Technology can be destroyed, and the mind can be paralyzed, but neither can berestricted. Whether and wherever such restrictions are attempted, it is themind—not the state—that withers away.Technology is applied science. The progress of theoretical science and oftechnology—i.e., of human knowledge—is moved by such a complex andinterconnected sum of the work of individual minds that no computer or committeecould predict and prescribe its course. The discoveries in one branch ofknowledge lead to unexpected discoveries in another; the achievements in onefield open countless roads in all the others. The space exploration program, forinstance, has led to invaluable advances in medicine. Who can predict when,where or how a given bit of information will strike an active mind and what itwill produce?To restrict technology would require omniscience—a total knowledge of all thepossible effects and consequences of a given development for all the potentialinnovators of the future. Short of such omniscience, restrictions mean theattempt to regulate the unknown, to limit the unborn, to set rules for theundiscovered.And more: an active mind will not function by permission. An inventor will notspend years of struggle dedicated to an excruciating work if the fate of hiswork depends, not on the criterion of demonstrable truth, but on the arbitrarydecision of some “authorities.” He will not venture out on a course whereroadblocks are established at every turn, in the form of the horrendousnecessity to seek, to beg, to plead for the consent of a committee. The historyof major inventions, even in semi-free societies, is a shameful record, as faras the collective wisdom of an entrenched professional consensus is concerned.As to the notion that progress is unnecessary, that we know enough, that we canstop on the present level of technological development and maintain it, withoutgoing any farther—ask yourself why mankind’s history is full of the wreckage ofcivilizations that could not be maintained and vanished along with suchknowledge as they had achieved; why men who do not move forward, fall back intothe abyss of savagery.Even a primitive, preindustrial economy, run primarily on muscle power, cannotfunction successfully through the mere repetition of a routine of motions bypassively obedient men who are not permitted to think. How long would a modemfactory last if it were operated by mechanics trained to a routine performance,without a single engineer among them? How long would the engineers last withouta single scientist? And a scientist—in the proper meaning of the term—is a manwhose mind does not stand still.Machines are an extension of man’s mind, as intimately dependent on it as hisbody, and they crumble, as his body crumbles, when the mind stops.A stagnant technology is the equivalent of a stagnant mind. A “restricted”technology is the equivalent of a censored mind.But—the ecologists claim—men would not have to work or think, the computerswould do everything. Try to project a row of computers programmed by a bunch ofhippies.Now observe the grim irony of the fact that the ecological crusaders and theiryoung activist followers are vehement enemies of the status quo—that theydenounce middle-class passivity, defy conventional attitudes, clamor for action,scream for “change”—and that they are cringing advocates of the status quo inregard to nature.In confrontation with nature, their plea is: “Leave well enough alone.” Do notupset the balance of nature—do not disturb the birds, the forests, the swamps,the oceans—do not rock the boat (or even build one)—do not experiment—do notventure out—what was good enough for our anthropoid ancestors is good enough forus—adjust to the winds, the rains, the man-eating tigers, the malarialmosquitoes, the tsetse flies—do not rebel—do not anger the unknowable demons whorule it all.In their cosmology, man is infinitely malleable, controllable and dispensable,nature is sacrosanct. It is only man—and his work, his achievement, hismind—that can be violated with impunity, while nature is not to be defiled by asingle bridge or skyscraper. It is only human beings that they do not hesitateto murder, it is only human schools that they bomb, only human habitations thatthey burn, only human property that they loot—while they crawl on their belliesin homage to the reptiles of the marshlands, whom they protect from theencroachments of human airfields, and humbly seek the guidance of the stars onhow to live on this incomprehensible planet.They are worse than conservatives—they are “conservationists.” What do they wantto conserve? Anything, except man. What do they want to rule? Nothing, exceptman.“The creator’s concern is the conquest of nature. The parasite’s concern is theconquest of men,” said Howard Roark in The Fountainhead. It was published in1943. Today, the moral inversion is complete; you can see it demonstrated inaction and in explicit confessions.The obscenity of regarding scientific progress as “aggression” against nature,while advocating universal slavery for man, needs no further demonstration.But some of those crusaders’ vicious absurdities are worth noting.Whom and what are they attacking? It is not the luxuries of the “idle rich,” butthe availability of “luxuries” to the broad masses of people. They aredenouncing the fact that automobiles, air conditioners and television sets areno longer toys of the rich, but are within the means of an average Americanworker—a beneficence that does not exist and is not fully believed anywhere elseon earth.What do they regard as the proper life for working people? A life of unrelieveddrudgery, of endless, gray toil, with no rest, no travel, no pleasure—above all,no pleasure. Those drugged, fornicating hedonists do not know that man cannotlive by toil alone, that pleasure is a necessity, and that television hasbrought more enjoyment into more lives than all the public parks and settlementhouses combined.What do they regard as luxury? Anything above the “bare necessities” of physicalsurvival——with the explanation that men would not have to labor so hard if itwere not for the “artificial needs” created by “commercialism” and“materialism.” In reality, the opposite is true: the less the return on yourlabor, the harder the labor. It is much easier to acquire an automobile in NewYork City than a meal in the jungle. Without machines and technology, the taskof mere survival is a terrible, mind-and-body-wrecking ordeal. In “nature,” thestruggle for food, clothing and shelter consumes all of a man’s energy andspirit; it is a losing struggle—the winner is any flood, earthquake or swarm oflocusts. (Consider the 500,000 bodies left in the wake of a single flood inPakistan; they had been men who lived without technology.) To work only for barenecessities is a luxury that mankind cannot afford.Who is the first target of the ecological crusade? No, not big business. Thefirst victims will be a specific group: those who are young, ambitious and poor.The young people who work their way through college; the young couples who plantheir future, budgeting their money and their time; the young men and women whoaim at a career; the struggling artists, writers, composers who have to earn aliving, while developing their creative talents; any purposeful humanbeing—i.e., the best of mankind. To them, time is the one priceless commodity,most passionately needed. They are the main beneficiaries of electricpercolators, frozen foods, washing machines and labor-saving devices. And if theproduction and, above all, the invention of such devices is retarded ordiminished by the ecological crusade, it will be one of the darkest crimesagainst humanity—particularly because the victims’ agony will be private, theirvoices will not be heard, and their absence will not be noticed publicly until ageneration or two later (by which time, the survivors will not be able to noticeanything).But there is a different group of young people, the avant-garde and cannonfodder of the ecological crusade, the products of “Progressive” education: thepurposeless. These are the concrete-bound, mentally stunted youths, who areunable to think or to project the future, who can grasp nothing but theimmediate moment. To them, time is an enemy to kill—in order to escape aconfrontation with inner emptiness and chronic anxiety. Unable to generate andcarry out a goal of their own, they seek and welcome drudgery—the drudgery ofmere physical labor, provided, planned and directed by someone else. You saw itdemonstrated on their so-called “Earth Day,” when young people who did not takethe trouble to wash their own bodies, went out to clean the sidewalks of NewYork.These youths have some counterparts among the group they regard as theirantagonists: the middle class. I once knew a hard-working housewife whosehusband offered to buy her a dishwashing machine, which he could easily afford;she refused it; she would not name her reason, but it was obvious that shedreaded the emptiness of liberated time.Combine the blank stare of that housewife with the unwashed face and snarlingmouth of a hippie—and you will see the soul of the Anti-Industrial Revolution.These are its followers. The soul of its leaders is worse. What do the leadershope to gain in practice? I shall answer by quoting a passage from AtlasShrugged. It was published in 1957—and I must say that I am not happy abouthaving been prophetic on this particular issue.It is a scene in which Dagny Taggart, at a conference with the country’seconomic planners, begins to grasp their motives.Then she saw the answer; she saw the secret premise behind their words.... Thesemen were moved forward, not by the image of an industrial skyline, but by thevision of that form of existence which the industrialists had swept away—thevision of a fat, unhygienic rajah of India, with vacant eyes staring in indolentstupor out of stagnant layers of flesh, with nothing to do but run precious gemsthrough his fingers and, once in a while, stick a knife into the body of astarved, toil-dazed, germ-eaten creature, as a claim to a few grains of thecreature’s rice, then claim it from hundreds of millions of such creatures andthus let the rice grains gather into gems.She had thought that industrial production was a value not to be questioned byanyone; she had thought that these men’s urge to expropriate the factories ofothers was their acknowledgment of the factories’ value. She, born of theindustrial revolution, had not held as conceivable, had forgotten along with thetales of astrology and alchemy, what these men knew in their secret, furtivesouls: ... that so long as men struggle to stay alive, they’ll never produce solittle but that the man with the club won’t be able to seize it and leave themstill less, provided millions of them are willing to submit—that the hardertheir work and the less their gain, the more submissive the fiber of theirspirit—that men who live by pulling levers at an electric switchboard, are noteasily ruled, but men who live by digging the soil with their naked fingers,are—that the feudal baron did not need electronic factories in order to drinkhis brains away out of jeweled goblets, and neither did the rajahs of thePeople’s State of India.
