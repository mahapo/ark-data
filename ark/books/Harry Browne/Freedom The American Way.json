Stone, a Califo rnia industrial engineer, wrote a newspaper column recommending a Constitutional amen dment to restrain federal powers. He based his recommendation on years of stu dying ancient, medieval and American history ~ as well as American personal fr eedom principles. The amendment he recommended was similar to Section I o f what is now titled the Liberty Amendment. Text of the proposed Liberty Amendment Section 1. The Government of the United States shal l not engage in any business, professional, commercial, financial or in dustrial enterprise except as specified in the Constitution. Section 2. The constitution or laws of any State, o r the laws of the United States shall not be subject to the terms of any foreign or domestic agreement which would abrogate this amendm ent. Section 3. The activities of the United States Gove rnment which violate the intent and purpose of this amendment shall, wit hin a period of three years from the date of the ratification of this ame ndment, be liquidated and the properties and facilities affected shall be sold. Section 4. Three years after the ratification of th is amendment the sixteenth article of amendments to the Constitution of the United States shall stand repealed and thereafter Congress shall not levy taxes on personal incomes, estates, and/or gifts. By 1949, Mr. Stone was devoting all his time t o the Liberty Amendment; and in 1959 he founded the National Committee for Economic Freedom ~ later known as the Liberty Amendment Committee. The committee's sole p urpose was to form affiliated State Committees to promote and present his propose d Constitutional amendment to the State Legislatures. In February of 1959, Wyoming became the first state to pass a Resolution for the Liberty Amendment; Nevada became the second in Marc h, 1960; Texas was the third in May, 1960; Louisiana was the fourth in June, 196 0; Georgia was the fifth in February, 1962; and South Carolina was the sixth in March, 1962.* *In 1982, Mississippi, Arizona and Indiana became t he seventh, eighth, and ninth states to endorse the Liberty Amendment. Over the next few years the Congressional resolution for the Amendment [H.J. Res. 23] was sponsored by several Representatives. Then on January 28, 2003, the Hon. Ron Paul of Texas introd uced, in The House of Representatives, House Joint Resolution 15. The resolution proposed an amendment to the U.S. Consti tution to prohibit the U.S. Government from engagin g in competitive business with its citizens and to abolish personal income, e state, and gift taxes. The resolution was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. For more information of the Liberty Amen dment go to: www.LibertyAmendment.org. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 8 The Liberty Amendment was popular among libert arian movement activists in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The economist, Murray R othbard, is purported to have called it a \"magnificent\" idea. Libertarian Party f ounder, David Nolan, led the Committee's youth division in the late 1960s. And W illis E. Stone, the Amendment’s author, was a speaker at several early Libertarian Party conventions. AMERICAN PROGRESS FOR ECONOMIC FREEDOM In the summer of 1962 the economist, businessm an, and lecturer, Harry Browne, was named the advertising manager for the Liberty A mendment Committee's bi- monthly publication American Progress for Economic Freedom . The purpose of the magazine was to educate the public and gain support for the Liberty Amendment. By October of that same year Mr Browne was named assoc iate editor, and by November he was the editor. The following Spring the magazin e was renamed Freedom Magazine, and Mr. Browne continued as its editor un til February of 1964 when he turned his full-time attention to the American Way Features, Inc. AMERICAN WAY FEATURES, INC. In the Spring of 1962, Harry Browne, Gordon va n B. King, and Willis E. Stone formed the company American Way Features. The compa ny was incorporated in June of 1962, and its stockholders were the original thr ee founders. Upon incorporation, American Way Features, Inc. purchased the assets of a 25-year-old company, Peck Associates, in Largo, Florida. The company’s purpos e was to provide economic education to business and the public. Harry Browne was the company's President, and he was uniquely qualified for the position. He was an original thinker in the field o f economics. He had developed new, more simplified, theories concerning wage rates, ca uses of recessions and depressions, and effects of governmental intervention into the m arket. And his conclusions ~ while conforming with those of the most respected free ma rket economists ~ were derived independently. And the conclusions greatly simplifi ed existing theories. Services American Way Features offered several services ~ including newspaper feature services, public courses, and education programs. 1. Newspaper Feature Services: The company's newspaper feature services focused on American libertarian views of national affairs, economics, business, and the free market. Harry Browne, a syndicated-newspaper column ist (whose weekly"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 9 newspaper column, \"The American Way\" was appearing in 100 newspapers across America) produced The Weekly Bulletin ~ a four-page editorial service. The press service provided American newspapers the best origi nal editorial comments selected each week from over 500 newspapers. In add ition, the company offered Between The Bookends, a book review column aimed to turn apathetic citize ns into alert patriot readers. 2. Public Courses: Harry Browne, a highly-polished in-demand public sp eaker, who had given approximately 200 lectures the previous y ear, had the ability to put economics on a basis that all could understand and profit from. So he wrote, offered, and presented several public education cou rses featuring topics such as freedom, morality, and economics. The Art of Profitable Living,* The Economics of Freedom, The Economics of Success, How To Surviv e a Monetary Crisis , etc. were offered as a series of eight-week sessions, on e-day seminars, or both. 3. Employee Education Programs: A businessman and salesman himself, Harry Browne had applied economic theory to daily busines s management. So he produced a dynamic employee educational program tha t specialized in the communication of economic truths tailor-made for ex ecutives and employees. Your Future Is In Your Hands was a twice monthly publication that presented one basic economic truth that could be quickly read and understood by the reader. Y our Future required no effort on the part of the employer, no training, and no time off the job. The only company effort required was to subscribe to the service and supply the names and addresses of all their emp loyees. Then folders were distributed to employees as a courtesy by their emp loyers. The issues taught employees how to become more prod uctive workers, how to become advocates of the private enterprise system, and how to respect their jobs. They were mailed directly to the employee’s home; a nd the company was billed monthly for the cost. Harry Browne wrote the folder's short articles, and an artist's cartoon pertaining to the article's subject was included on the back of e ach folder. The articles were factual, well-reasoned and written in language that all could understand and appreciate. They generated no controversy because t he truths presented were self- evident and time-tested. There was no rancor, no pe rsonal attacks, no bitterness. The issues inspired employees to want to be worth more to their company ~ to *The Art of Profitable Living (newly titled Rule Your World ~ Finding Freedom and Living Profit ably) is described in detail at www.HarryBrowne.org and is c urrently available as a 20-CD album or downloadable version.

Your Future talked to employees in their language ~ showing them how they would benefit by understanding and practicing the t ime-tested economic truths. It showed the employee: how to earn more money by prod ucing more, and how his standard of living depended upon a free economy. It appealed to the profit motives of the employee. It showed the employee how he coul d obtain more of what he wanted in life. It demonstrated, on an easy-to-unde rstand basis, the simple truths of economic life ~ and how he could use the truths to raise his standard of living. The articles didn't assume a prior interest by the employee, but instead attracted his interest with provocative headlines that would appe al to his self-interest. They didn't act as \"apologists\" for management. There wa s no \"management side\" of the story; everyone was subject to the same economic tr uths. The language was simple and to the point. While it wasn't over anyone's hea d, it also avoided \"talking down\" to anyone. Your Future created both the desire to be of greater value, as well as periodically offering specific methods for providing it. While t he program was designed for the non-management employee, it was recommended for sup ervisory personnel, too. First, to know what their employees were receiving; and, second, because they would learn and profit from the material. And for a cost of only 35-50 cents per month, per employee (depending upon the number of e mployees the employer chose to enroll) the program was quite a bargain.

When we do, however, we have allowed oursel ves to be maneuvered into the battle that the enemy has chosen , at the time and place of his choosing. There is only one way to protect ourselves against all present or potential invasions or threats to our liberty. That way, of course, is to use “the Chains of the Constitution” to bind down from mischief the potential of government to infringe upon our liberty. If, however, we allow ourselves to be drawn into ev ery battle the enemy would like to fight, we will soon find ourselves with no time, en ergy, or resources left to do the main job we set out to do. What we too often forget is just how conclusively t he Liberty Amendment will enforce our freedom. Once we have seen it through t o its adoption, many other accomplishments ~ which we have considered as separ ate battles ~ will automatically come about. Look over the follow list of 35 benefits which are by no meals all the values which will accrue from the passage of the Liberty Amendme nt. Is there one or more that is currently occupying your mind and body? If so, by p utting your energies into the Liberty Amendment, you can automatically fight all 35 of these battles at one time. For the Liberty Amendment will: 1. Get us “back to the Constitution” 2. Restore states’ rights 3. Cut the cost of government approximately in half 4. End the unfair competition that government has laun ched against private enterprises 5. Declare our belief in liberty to the captive people s throughout the world 6. Serve notice on tyranny everywhere that we really d o stand for freedom 7. End thousands of Defense Department activities that waste vital funds earmarked for national security 8. End the threat of socialized medicine once and for all 9. Affirm completely the doctrine of local control of education ~ thereby eliminating any possibility of federal or international c ontrol 10.

There is no need to fight negatively on all the sep arate fronts above. We can all approach freedom from a positive standpoint. Passag e of the Liberty Amendment will automatically eliminate many threats we now fear, r ectify wrongs that have occurred, and promote a climate of freedom and security from further governmental intervention.

By Harry Browne/Associate Editor American Progress for Economic Freedom Magazine Volume 7, No. 4 September-October, 1962 LOUD AND CLEAR , throughout the land, the politicians are calling for a tax cut. They propose to reduce income taxes ~ claiming that this will put more money into the hands of the consumer, thereby stimulating the economy. Is that really what will happen? Let’s trace the inevitable chain of events: 1. The government lowers income taxes ~ let’s suppose it cuts $9 billion. 2. The government’s deficit for the current fiscal yea r is thereby increased by $9 billion. 3. In order to finance the increased deficit, the Trea sury Department sells additional bonds, totaling $9 billion, to banks of the Federal Reserve System. 4. The Reserve System pays for the bonds by issuing th e equivalent in new paper money (Federal Reserve Notes). 5. These notes increase the amount of money in circula tion (by $9 billion), thereby decreasing the total value of all money already in circulation (by $9 billion). Since only the supply of dollars is increased, while the supply of commodities remains the same, each commodity will inevitably equal more dollars. We call these rising prices “inflation.” 6. Those who receive the income tax cuts may not be hu rt by the inflation, because they can obtain cost-of-living pay raises. But seni or citizens, widows, disabled veterans and others living on fixed savings will be forced to make up the difference ~ by having their money worth less than before the tax cut was instituted. In other words, a “reduction in taxes” without an e qual reduction in federal spending is nothing but fiction. It is just a shifting of th e load to areas we don’t watch as closely. To gain favor with the wage-earner, the po litician turns to robbing widows again! Let’s make a motion to bring about real taxpayer relief. Here’s how it works: 1. Cancel all foreign aid for a starter. If the nation is as bad off as the government says, we obviously can’t afford to support alien go vernments around the world. That will save $4.5 billion. 2. Eliminate all farm subsidies, price supports, soil bank, and other agricultural subsidies. That would save our widows about another $4.5 billion."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 16 3. Thus, we will have saved $9 billion for the governm ent this year, without losing a penny’s worth of service. This will save the average family $225 in taxes. And that will be true relief, not the sleight-of-hand variety. But for real relief, let’s pass the Liberty Amendme nt. That will compel the government to give up all of its wasteful, unconsti tutional activities ~ thus providing for complete repeal of income taxes. That will certainly “get the economy moving” ~ as w ell as restore our lost liberties ~ and it will be the American Way!

By Harry Browne/Associate Editor American Progress for Economic Freedom Magazine Editorial Volume 7, No. 4 September-October, 1962 Millions of Americans are concerned, anxious, and a ngry today. They have come to realize the terrible dangers that face us and threa ten our civilization. They have become aware of the deceit that lulled us to sleep as the threat developed. This awakening is often accompanied by bitterness, a desire for revenge ~ and even hatred ~ toward those considered responsible for ou r troubles. Many label communism or socialism as the nation’s n umber one problem. Then they begin looking for reasons behind the problem ~ a ca use behind the effect ~ or even a cause behind the cause. It becomes fashionable to p in the ultimate responsibility on some specific individual, group, or movement. In th e course of their investigation, people often get so wrapped up in the questions of “who” that they lose sight of the problem itself; and they insist that others join th em in branding this particular “who” as the real threat. The target for their bitterness could be almost any one or any group. However, there are certain theories that have developed particular popularity. These theories place the blame for all our troubles on one of our great reli gions ~ or on a centuries-old secret society ~ or on a conspiracy of the rich or the poo r. And the entity thus selected becomes the target of all wrath. It is not our desire or intention here to pass judg ment on the possible truth of any particular theory. In fact, the point we’d like to make is that we’d be better off not worrying about which target or which theory has the most merit. Even if we could identify one of these “enemies” wi th certainty, we would accomplish very little. For we must deal with facts, not peopl e. Crimes against the people or acts of oppression are a manifestation ~ or symptom ~ of our real enemy. And that real enemy is not a “who” ~ it’s a “what.” Our enemy is tyranny ~ ~Whether in the slave camps of Vortuka, in the mass acre of innocent people in Katanga, or in the harassment of private enterprise in America, its name is the same ~ tyranny. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 18 Since it works through many elements and people, it is easy for us to mistakenly direct all of our attention at the people who carry out its evil designs. But the people are only pawns in tyranny’s endless war of oppressi on. Tyranny persecuted the Jews in Egypt, the Christian s in the later days of Rome, and the Colonists in America. Every page of history is drenched with the blood of its oppression. It has always been the enemy of man, and it always will be. But it is not unbeatable ~ despite the fact that it has so overpowered man for ages. To defeat tyranny, we must understand it. We must i dentify its weapon and disarm it. Big business can not oppress an unwilling public ~ until tyranny’s weapon enters the picture. A corrupt labor union official is only a petty thie f ~ until tyranny’s weapon is placed in his hand. Tyranny’s weapon is always the same. Without it, it is powerless. With it, it is hell on earth. Tyranny’s only source of strength, its only method of oppression, its weapon ~ is political force . The machinery of government is always preferred b y tyrants. No problem, no criminal, no swindler can oppress a society, until it legalizes its immorality through political contrivance. When it g ains control of the police, the courts, and the power to confiscate, it becomes a t errible oppressor. Tyranny can not exist where the power of government is strictly limited to an enforcible size and scope. But tyranny thrives where the government is unlimit ed, and is the prize of the most ruthless. Every possible conspiracy ever seen or imagined by the mind of man has had as its object the control of unlimited government. It has no plans for power that do not involve political collusion of government. Yet how oppressive could such a conspiracy become i f government is strictly limited by indestructible safeguards? It is the size and scope of government that makes t he difference. Next time you want to lash out at a Billie Sol Estes, remember: It is the limitless potential for plunder,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 19 through bureaucratic government, that created him, and thousands like him not yet exposed. Without it, he would have been a harmless pickpocket from Pecos. The labor leader who controls a million-dollar trea sury and harasses business unfairly is not the cause of our problems. The machinery of government has been abused to put him where he is and give him immunity. Strangely, most of these people who earn our contem pt for participating in tyranny might have been splendid citizens were not the plun der of unlimited government so alluring. But tyranny can be defeated. By eliminating tyranny, we eliminate the plunderers . By binding down our government with the “chains of the Constitution,” we can thwart tyranny. By making it impossible for government to trespass beyond certain well- defined limits, we automatically void the capacity for oppression. No matter “who” may be the practitioner creating ou r problem, the solution is still the same ~ prevent the limitless expansion of governmen t. The Liberty Amendment is capable of reducing the si ze and scope of government to the point where it can’t be utilized as an instrume nt for tyranny by any conspiracy. The Liberty Amendment will restore to private use t he billions of dollars of private wealth now at the disposal of whoever captures cont rol of the power of government. So why sit around and argue the questions of “who”? Let’s instead concentrate on the remedy ~ the one cure that applies to any possible conspiracy. Let’s let hatred be the monopoly of the conspirator s. We don’t need to direct it at anyone. It saps our strength and weakens our case. We have a solution ~ let’s concentrate on it. No matter who or what you consider to be the manife station of the enemy, the Liberty Amendment will prevent it from carrying our its evi l designs. It will restore the guards that will prevent tyranny from using our government as a weapon. We all have one common enemy. It is tyranny. Let’s defeat it by applying Thomas Jefferson’s reco mmendation: “Let no more be heard of confidence in many, just bind him down fro m mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 20 We can do this by adopting the Liberty Amendment.

So many things seem to be wrong in America today. But do we know exactly what we’re for? Oh yes, that seems pretty obvious ~ we’re for the opposite of all the things we’re against. Why then don’t we ever discuss the things we’re for? Can we, for instance, name the specific proposals w e have in mind to get America back on the right track? Or is our ability limited to identifying the events or individuals that took American off the track? We ask this question because many people on the Ame rican side apparently feel that all we have to do is “wake up” enough Americans to what’s wrong, and somehow America will be saved. As a result, we find ourselv es rushing about, sounding the alarm, trying desperately to get others as alarmed as we. WHERE ARE WE GOING? But just where does all this end? How many people have to “wake up” to make everything all right? One million? Ten million? 100 million? And what happens once the required number has been awakened? What sort of action will take place to correct all of our problems? A negative approach ~ exposing problems without spe cifying solutions ~ leaves us wide open to dangerous possibilities. Witness those who utilize criticism of the UN as justification for strengthening it? Is that what yo u hand in mind when you criticized it? Our negative approach has made it extremely difficu lt to attract support. People don’t like to learn of a threat to the status quo ~ but t hey often respond to ways to better existing conditions. With a negative approach, those who do “wake up” invariably become greatly alarmed ~ sometimes almost hysterical ~ and rush ou t to fight with no sense of direction. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 22 And, lastly, our negative approach loads ourselves with an impossible task ~ that of going on forever, trying to awaken people ~ with no goal, no end in sight. HALF-DONE JOBS Perhaps the futility of this approach can best be i llustrated by a hypothetical TV commercial that convinced you your life was in dang er from “tired blood” ~ and then didn’t bother to tell you what to get to protect yo urself against it. Isn’t that what we’re doing when we sound alarms about the peril from co mmunism or socialism ~ and then don’t bother to show people how we can whip those perils? If you asked the TV announcer how to cure “tired bl ood” and he said, “Go convince others of the danger,” would you be very impressed? We should consider any freedom-selling job only hal f done ~ if we’ve only called attention to an existing problem, and failed to adv ance a solution. This rule should apply to conversations with friends, letters-to-the -editor, speeches, articles, letters to Congressmen ~ in short, every effort on behalf of l iberty. LET’S START SOLVING PROBLEMS Instead of developing an addiction to studying the nature of e vil and its problems, we should devote ourselves to the enactment of the pro per solution. In fact, no matter how many problems we can find to be against (and th e list is endless), the solution is still the same. Afraid of federalized education or socialized medicine? Th e Liberty Amendment will stop them once and for all. Upset about inflation from printing-press money? Th e Liberty Amendment will restore balanced budgets and the Constitutional pro cess of coining money. Worried about loss of our national sovereignty thro ugh various means? Section two of the Liberty Amendment will erect a protective wall between our sovereignty and any potential foreign entrapment. Against high income taxes? Foreign aid? The farm me ss? Confiscation of lands and businesses? Then the Liberty Amendment is the solut ion to your problems. What are we for? We’re for the Liberty Amendment. S o why bother talking about anything else? Let’s de-emphasize the hundreds of t hings we’re against ~ long enough to do what’s necessary to defeat them. Let’s focus attention on what we’re for , and start moving forward. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 23 When you stand for the Liberty Amendment ~ and talk about it ~ your proposal is the issue. Instead of your trying to stop the further e nlargement of bureaucracy, the bureaucrats will be trying to stop you from shrinking it. You’ll be on the offensive, and they’ll be in the futile position of protecting the status quo. And, strangely enough, when you quit trying to “awa ken” people by warning against intangible dangers, they start responding. When you promote the benefits of the Liberty Amendment ~ lower taxes and freedom from ar bitrary government intervention ~ people “awaken” in a hurry. THE TIME FOR ACTION And, in reality, there are already enough people in America today who know what’s wrong. The “awakening” period should be over. Now the “awakened” army should start driving for wh at is right. With literally millions of Americans strongly oppos ed to big government, how long would it take to pass the Liberty Amendment ~ if ev en a fraction of them were to devote themselves to nothing else? We can have that kind of concerted action if we will just point the way. The next time someone starts telling you what’s wrong, introduce him to the Liberty Amendme nt as the proper solution. Make sure that both he and you are doing something positive to insure its victory. Let’s keep occupied with the Liberty Amendment unti l victory is ours ~ and our problems are solved. Let’s be sure our main emphasis is always on what we want to happen instead of what we’re against.

In it, he sets forth a s pecific program by which we can restore the American republic and end the Communist threat. Harry Browne is the Editor of Freedom Magazine. He also writes a weekly syndicated column, The American Way , and is the Managing Editor of American Way Featur es, Inc. Brief passages of this article have appeared in print pre viously as parts of editorials in this magazine.”) This article is about victory. There’ll be no revelations of new impending threats from the left . Instead, we’re going to dwell on victory. Let’s decide, once and for all, what it is we’re go ing to do to win this cold war. Let’s turn our eyes away from such questions as “How do we prevent the late st disarmament plan?” or “Can we keep them from abolis hing the House Committee on Unamerican Activities?” or “Will we be able to stop socialized medicine?” Let’s instead ask ourselves one very basic question : “How are we going to restore the American republic and end the Communist threat?” In short, we must discover the strategy of victory ~ a program to win this war in which we find ourselves We’ve delayed this decision too long. And, as a res ult, we are losing. No matter how you measure it ~ by the size of the federal budget or the amount of countries in Communist hands ~ every year the cause of freedom m oves backward a little further. But if we honestly and thoughtfully examine our los ing ways, we can find our weakness and correct it. This requires a negative approach for the first par t of our search. But once we understand why we’re losing, and what must be accom plished to win, we can formulate a precise, specific plan for winning the cold war. So let’s get started looking for victory."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 25 Perhaps the best way to begin is to call attention to our government’s foreign policy of “containment” ~ a policy we enjoy criticizing. And why shouldn’t we? It’s a defensive policy ~ one that is doomed to eventual defeat. Because when you try to contain the enemy w here he is now, he’ll keep nibbling away and nibbling away ~ until pretty soon you find you have nothing left to defend. So the entire policy is futile. But any conservativ e knows that. Yet, while we preach against containment by our gov ernment, we conservatives are practicing this very same policy of containment our selves ~ in our battle against communism and socialism. We’re always on the defensive. We’re either trying to prevent federal aid to education; or to stop a UN bond issue; or to halt socialized medicine. Name just about anything at all that’s an issue and a battleground today, and you’ll find the same thing: we are on the defensive, trying to prevent the enemy from acquiring some new territory that is presently ours . In other words, we’re fighting a war of containment ~ the very same kind we love to criticize. Our whole strategy at the present time a mounts to trying to keep the enemy from winning one more victory today. When you’re on the defensive ~ like this ~ the enem y doesn’t need to win every battle, or even a majority of them. If he only wins one occ asionally, he still comes out ahead. Because every victory for him means a step forward. While every victory for us means only that we didn’t lose any more ground for a change. And each time the enemy wins, his victory becomes t he new “status quo” ~ which is never again challenged. Once he acquires a new doma in, we not only don’t try to take it back from him, we often will defend his right to keep i t! For example, three years ago we fought against the “medical care” legislation that eventually passed as the Kerr-Mills Bill. Now today , when you’d think we’d be trying to repeal it, it appears that half the people on ou r side are praising the Kerr-Mills Bill ~ in an attempt to head off the King-Anderson Bill. The Kerr-Mills Bill has become the new “status quo” ~ and the enemy is trying to improve upon it. And we are trying to hold the matt er still by praising ~ or at least respecting ~ the very thing we once condemned. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 26 CONSTANT RETREAT This seems like a strange phenomenon, but it’s actually very t ypical of an army that’s in retreat. In fact, we’re moving backward so rapid ly, any time we hold the enemy still for one day, we manage to deceive ourselves into ca lling it a victory for our side. The dictionary labels this whole strategy a “reacti ve” one. That means we have no capacity to originate, only instead to react to the enemy’s latest attack. And so this cold war reduces itself to a simple “ca use and effect” formula: the enemy attacks, we react. As a result, we have “brushfire battles.” The enemy starts fires, and we rush around from one to the other ~ trying to put them out. We never stop to think that he can start far more f ires than we can ever hope to put out. So all he has to do is start enough of them, a nd his opposition is all tied up. What an enviable position for the enemy ~ he has vi ctory assured. In every battle he enters, he has everything to gain and nothing to lo se. While we have only the hope of not losing so much for a change. Why do we allow ourselves to fight this life-or-dea th war with such a hopeless strategy? If we are fighting this battle for our ve ry lives and property ~ as we keep telling ourselves ~ then why do we settle for a pol icy that makes certain defeat just a matter of time? This question has been raised before, of course. An d answers have been offered. Often it is argued that we are conducting a “holdin g action” ~ holding the enemy at bay while a stronger force is rallied. Or that thes e battles “wake people up” to what’s going on. But most likely the real reason we remain on the de fensive is simply our conviction ~ and fear ~ that there is nothing else we can do . We’re afraid that if we ever let up for a moment, the enemy will light the biggest fire of al l, and the nation will go up in smoke. So we feel it’s necessary that we do anything we ca n to slow down his progress. We try to keep his fires from spreading ~ and rejoice anytime we win one of these skirmishes. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 27 And so our time, money and energy are poured into p rojects designed as holding actions ~ to prevent doomsday just a little longer, to hang on eight more hours in case a miracle is about to happen, in case the cavalry really is coming. And yet, even though we’re willing to accept so lit tle from our defensive policy, we get even less. We’re hoping to buy a little more ti me; but still we lose practically every battle. Add up all of the projects you’ve worked on in the past year, and count the number that succeeded (in other words, the number in which you didn’t lose any ground). If you can say you won 1 out of every 5, you’ve plenty to be thankful for. CHANGE NEEDED So no matter what the justification, our expenditures of time, money and energy have been largely wasted in our attempts to fight defens ively. The policy just isn’t succeeding from any standpoint. But what happens if we decide to take the offensive ? Where do we attack? What do we advocate? That, unfortunately, is a difficult question for m ost conservatives to answer ~ even though it shouldn’t be. But we’ve been on the defen sive for so long, it has affected our entire outlook. It has cornered us into a strictly negative position. We’ve just seen how negative our tactics are. We’ve been maneuvered into a position of pure defense ~ pure negativism ~ in which we bli ndly lash out against every new enemy offensive. But even that is only the beginning. For example, d o you recall the last time you gave a speech to a group of people, or wrote a letter-to -the-editor, or argued with friends? What did you talk about? If you’re like most of us, you pointed out specific evils or threats that exist today ~ hoping that some of the people in your audience wil l “wake up” to what’s going on. SINGLE STRATEGY In fact, isn’t that our whole strategy today? To aw aken as many people as possible to what’s wrong? Isn’t it our underlying belief that i f we can just “wake up” enough people, America will be saved? "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 28 The trouble is that we never bother to awaken them to the things we want to happen. We only point out what’s wrong. In fact, that’s all we ever seem to talk about ~ what’s wrong. We labor it to death ~ never bothering to propose t he solutions necessary to make things right. We just keep telling everybody how wr ong things are ~ how bad communism is ~ in hopes of “waking them up.” For so me reason, we believe that all we have to do is “wake up” enough of them and Amer ica will be saved. But what good are they when they wake up ~ if all t hey know is how wrong everything is? How can they help us restore the rep ublic when they don’t even know what has to be done to restore it. To illustrate this, suppose for a moment that you’r e watching a TV commercial. The announcer convinces you completely that your life i s in danger from the threat of “tired blood.” He realistically depicts the horribl e end that comes when someone finally dies from it, sparing none of the gory deta ils. Naturally, you’re scared to death. But the next thi ng you know, the commercial is all over, and the announcer didn’t bother to tell you w hat to get to protect yourself against tired blood. Suppose, then, you go to see him and ask, “How do I protect myself against tired blood?” His answer? His cure? He tells you to “go and convi nce others of the danger.” Do you really think that’s going to save you from tired bl ood? But isn’t that exactly what we do when we sound the alarm about communism and socialism ~ without ever specifying a solution? Are n’t we just as wrong, when we fail to point to the weapon, the accomplishment, that wi ll defeat the enemy we’re so concerned about? We get a man thoroughly aroused ~ half hysterical, in fact ~ and then turn him loose. We provide no direction. We never tell him specific ally what we’re trying to accomplish ~ other than to “fight communism.” We ju st turn him loose and he takes off ~ alienating friends and hurting the cause. Does this really help America? What good is it to wake up everybody? All we have t o look forward to is the day when 100 million people have awakened. Then we’ll have 100 million frightened, frustrated, panic-stricken conservatives ~ rushing around the countryside from brushfire to br ushfire."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 29 What are we doing wrong? Where is the weakness in o ur strategy? Let’s try to sum it all up. We are totally preoccupied with the enemy. Practically everything we do is a reaction to the enemy ~ or what we think is the enemy, anywa y. We study books about the enemy for hours on end. We seek out every new theory about him ~ his identity, his characteristics. We debate his strategy ~ not ours, but his. We try to determine what he’s up to ~ where he’s going to strike next ~ and how he’ll go about it. And upon these determinations of his strategy, we finally figure out ours. Our strategy, of course, is always the same ~ to apply counterforce wherever he’s applying force. Where does all this end? Are we going to spend the rest of our lives trying to prevent the enemy from doing things? Are we destined to go down to defeat ~ while meticu lously naming the events or individuals that took America off the track? Or do we have in mind some idea of how America is going to get back on the track? Do we or don’t we have answers for all of the quest ions we raise? Do we have solutions for all of the problems we expose? Do we have a goal in sight for which we are working? Are we ready to accept the inadequacy of our defens ive policy and take the offensive? Isn’t it time to start fighting to win or else forg et the whole thing? The missing ingredient, of course, is a program for victory . We are losing simply because we have made no attemp t to win. We are on the defensive because we haven’t even con sidered what we might like to accomplish. Well let’s not put if off any longer. Let’s decide, right here and now, what it is we want to accomplish ~ and how we’re going to go abo ut it. First, what is our goal? "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 30 To preserve the status quo? With its confiscatory t axation, foreign aid and government insurance programs? No thanks. To stop the growth of socialism? That too implies s aving the status quo. To keep the Communists from taking us over? And lea ve them in control of the rest of the world? Again, this doesn’t seem to strike the m ark. What most of us seem to be longing for is a dual go al: To restore the American republic and destroy the Co mmunist conspiracy. Doesn’t that take in everything we are trying to do ~ no matter whether we call ourselves conservatives, libertarians or true liber als? We want a return ~ not to 1960 or 1933 ~ but to the original climate of freedom that will permit man to resume his upward climb, unhinde red by the whims of an arbitrary government. And we intend to end the Communist threat, not live with it. We should all be able to agree that this goal cover s our major desires. And if we can find the means to bring it about, we should all be willing to concentrate on the task. But what are those means? Have we a weapon with whi ch to accomplish this? Yes, we have. We possess a weapon that is capable o f turning our chaos, disunity and confusion into strength. We have a tool that can unite all of the diverse an d widely-scattered forces on our side. In other worlds, we do have a program for victory. It begins with the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. Most of us ha ve familiarized ourselves with the Amendment to some degree. We know that the LIBERTY AMENDMENT will repeal the income tax and cut down on government spending. So it has a lot of appeal f or us. It’s something we’d all like to see happen. So we silently wish it well ~ and then get back to our brushfire battles. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 31 But we don’t stop to realize just how much the LIBE ERTY AMENDMENT will accomplish. The first section, which is the heart of it says: The Government of the United States shall not engag e in any business, professional, commercial, financia l or industrial enterprise except as specified in the Co nstitution. The second section protects this prohibition from b eing overruled by treaty; the third provides for the liquidation of the government’s un constitutional activities; and the fourth section repeals the income tax. But the heart of the Amendment is in that first sec tion. Let’s look at some of the ramifications of it. It will: Cut the cost of government approximately in half; Return the power business to private companies; End the threat of socialized medicine once and for all; Eliminate any possibility of either federal or inte rnational control of education ~ so that we’ll never again have to fight those battles in Congress: End the farm mess; Restore states’ rights; Eliminate the threat of bureaucratic “mental health ” programs; Stop inflation; and End the so-called “federal reserve conspiracy.” And with the repeal of the income tax, we will auto matically: End the double taxation of dividends; End the special privileges of tax exempt foundation s ~ simply by extending tax exemption to all; and Initiate a true prosperity, based on real productio n and sound money values. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 32 In other words, the LIBERTY AMENDMENT will restore the American republic . It will return our government to the scope created for it by our founding fathers ~ not freeze it in its present chaotic condition. It will reestablish the concept of limited government ~ which is probably its most important attribute. We won’t have to fight the yea rly battles in Congress anymore, because Congress ~ any Congress ~ will once again be limited to the speci fic powers granted it in the Constitution. Within one single weapon, we have the power to undo all of the damage of the last fifty years. And, at the same time, we can automat ically prevent new socialistic schemes ~ which we don’t even know about yet ~ from ever getting off the ground. So the LIBERTY AMENDMENT is the tool with which to accomplish the first part of our dual objective. But what about the second pa rt: to destroy the Communist conspiracy? To accomplish this, patriots have been involved on many fronts. We have fought Communist infiltration, loss of sovereignty to inte rnational agencies, and the “no win” foreign policy. It would seem offhand that we need a second weapon ~ in addition to the LIBERTY AMENDMENT ~ with which to ward off these threats. But do we? Perhaps again we’ve been too superficial in our stu dy of the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. For its effect upon communism would be d ecisive indeed. Let’s take the matter of the international agencies . The second section of the LIBERTY AMENDMENT says: The constitution of laws of any State, or the laws of the United States shall not be subject to the terms of any foreign or domestic agreement which would abrogate this amendment. That means we can’t be involved in any international arrangement that, directly or indirectly, involves the United States Government i n any economic enterprise not specified in the Constitution. That means that an end to our government’s particip ation in UNESCO, UNICEF, UN bond issues and loans to Castro through the UN’s Sp ecial Fund. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 33 It means no financial support for such undertakings as the UN assault on Katanga. And it automatically precludes any repetition of th at sort of thing against other countries that might be next on the list. But, more important, the LIBERTY AMENDMENT does not attack the UN ~ it protects American sovereignty. In other words, it is not aimed at one particular organization that might be a threat today. It is in stead a protection of our sovereignty against any threat from any organization. So the LIBERTY AMENDMENT protects us against intern ational meddling in our affairs. But now let’s move further into the area of actuall y ending the Communist threat. What could we possibly do that would destroy it, on ce and for all, and lay to rest all of its millions of wriggling tentacles? To get the answer, let’s turn for a moment to the s tudying we’ve all done on the subject. It seems that we’ve all at some time or other, come to one fundamental conclusion ~ with respect to the nature of communism. We find th at not only is communism evil and ruthless and dangerous. But we find that it is also economically impossible . We come to realize that only capitalism can create wealth and abundance and strong nations. We know that collectivist systems have wit hin themselves the seeds of their own destruction ~ because they destroy the incentiv e to produce abundance. And so we all, at some point in our education, come to realize that the Communists should not have been able to keep their impractical and impossible economic system alive during the past 45 years ~ had all things been equal. Not only that ~ but we begin to wonder how they cou ld possibly become a dangerous threat to the world when their system is so weak. T hey obviously have received help from somewhere ~ but where? The answer, of course, is that they received it from us . There can be little doubt that if it hadn’t been for the help given the Soviets by th e United States, the conspiracy would have collapsed years ago. That help has taken many forms, and we are all well familiar with it. For just a few examples: We sell them machine tools on long-term credits, ev en though they invariably repudiate their debts."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 34 The Soviet Union has destroyed their own once-great wheat producing capacity, and now they need to import wheat desperately. So our g overnment rushes to the rescue, selling them wheat at below market prices ~ from our farmers. We’ve armed and trained the Yugoslavian Army and Ai r Force. Our foreign aid to Poland has financed the current North Vietnamese ag gression against South Vietnam ~ killing our own soliders in the process. There are thousands of other examples, but the poin t is: they keep their own impossible system going by feeding off of ours. It is the surplus fruits of capitalism that are compensating for the communist deficiencie s. They have become a menace to the world for one reas on only ~ because we have aided them with our own labor. But not willingly. I t has not been the American people that have poured billions into the Communist system . It has been the economic enterprises of our government ~ foreign aid, trade negotiations and guarantees, etc. Well, once you realize what caused the Communist threat ~ and what is keeping it alive ~ the solution becomes pretty obvious. In fact, we can see that most weapons proposed for our side ~ and many of the defenses already in existence ~ are not aimed at th e target at all. We don’t need a freedom academy, a stronger defense , closer ties with our allies, or a bigger propaganda program. All we need to do to defeat the Communists is to si mply stop helping them . Without our help, they couldn’t last six months. So we must go to work right now to “stop helping th e Communists.” We must force our own government to terminate all of its economic enterprises that are aiding our sworn enemy. And here again, our weapon is the LIBERTY AMENDMENT . It will force our government to give up all of its unconstitutional e conomic enterprises ~ including those that help the enemy. Once we pass the LIBERTY AMENDMENT the cold war wil l be within a few months of being over. Because two very important ef fects will take place. First, the Communist governments will lose the econ omic support that has enabled them to divert so much of their resources to holdin g down their slaves."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 35 Secondly, the captive peoples will realize that we really do believe in liberty ~ our own as well as theirs. And they will then have the incentive to revolt ~ knowing that we will not help to quell that revolt. This combination of weakening Communist governments and inspired captive peoples will destroy the Communist empire from within. And once it’s destroyed at its heart, all of is tentacles will lose their financing, insp iration and direction. So now let’s return to our goal ~ that of restoring the American republic and destroying the Communist conspiracy. Here we have the attainment of both parts of that g oal tied up in one positive act ~ the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. Don’t you agree that if we could just pass the LIBE RTY AMENDMENT, we will restore the American republic and destroy the Commu nist conspiracy? Is there any major problem that you can possibly th ink of that would not be solved just by achieving this one act? Isn’t this the weapon upon which we can all agree? All right then, if we can agree to this ~ if this is what we need to win this fight once and for all ~ hadn’t we better get to work right now and bring it about? Doesn’t it make sense that any time spent on any ot her project is only time taken away from our real job ~ that of accomplishing the one solution to our problems? Since we have a solution, shouldn’t we get busy and enact it? At this point, it would be appropriate to ask, “Can we possibly hope to bring about the LIBERTY AMENDMENT?” The answer to that question is “yes and no” ~ and p erhaps requires some explanation. Suppose we start to work at nine o’clock tomorrow m orning to pass the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. But then, at ten o’clock, we get diverte d into a brushfire battle to stop socialized medicine. If that is to be our course of action, the answer i s “no” ~ we can’t possibly succeed. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 36 But if even a fraction of those who want the LIBERTY AMENDMENT would actively work at it ~ consistently, without being diverted ~ the n the job can be done far sooner than any of us imagines. At the same time, if we keep giving reasons why the Amendment should be passed, but never mention the LIBETY AMENDMENT by name, how can it possibly succeed? We need to analyze the articles we write, our lette rs-to-the-editors, our comments to friends. Most of them present an excellent case for passing the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. But, for some reason, only 1 in 20 will ever suggest that as the solution to the problems just raised. So the answer to the question of the Amendment’s po ssibilities is just this: If we concentrate on it, and always spell it out in every presentation of our case, then there’s nothing strong enough to stop it. But if we pursue our same old policies ~ those of f ighting the brushfires and ignoring our own proposal ~ we’ll never obtain the LIBERTY A MENDMENT. “But,” you might ask, “Do we have enough people to do this job? Don’t we need to continue awakening more of the uncommitted?” This question can best be answered by citing an exa mple. When Dan Hanson, the Wyoming Chairman for the LIBERTY AMENDMENT, decided to work on the Amendment, he must have had many misgivings. After all, think of all the speeches that would be necessary ~ and the large committee he’d have to recruit. And think of all of the peopl e who have been “brainwashed” who’d have to be un brainwashed before you could ever hope to pass the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. Certainly he must have considered these obstacles. And, after thinking it over, he apparently decided it was impossible ~ at least on that basis. So he decided to forget about all of the uncommitted people and all of the brainwashed. Instead he went directly to the State Capitol and c onvinced enough state legislators to get the Amendment passed. And Wyoming became the fi rst state to approve the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. His only help was Willis Stone’s trip to Wyoming to testify at the legislature. The rest was all done by one man ~ working directly with the state legislators. Virtually the same thing happened in Nevada. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 37 The moral of this story is not that we only need one man in each state to succeed . But it does show that once you realize where the target is, the job becomes a lot easier. And all of those people you thought you needed sudd enly become unimportant. There are already at least one million people in Am erica actively working for the same general cause we are. If only 5% of these peop le ~ 50,000 ~ would agree to work exclusively on the Amendment for six months, i t would quickly become the major issue in America. The potential strength that would be unleashed is b eyond our ability to imagine. For when have we ever had even 1% of our resources behi nd anything of significance before? Our job is no longer that of waking people up, or e ducating them. It’s one of getting the people on our side to concentrate on the target . But even if you still feel that we need to awaken m ore people, you’ll arouse others faster by showing them a way to repeal their income tax ~ far faster than by trying to make them see the danger in socialized medicine. So there’s no reason to desert the Amendment ~ even if all you want is to awaken people. But suppose you’re still unconvinced. Suppose you f eel that, even with 50,000 people working on the Amendment, we can’t achieve it. Then it still doesn’t matter. No matter what you wa nt to do, by stating your case in a positive manner, from an offensive position, your c ase is stronger. This applies even if you’re concerned about a brushfire battle. A good o ffense is automatically a good defense. If you want to influence your Congressman to reject a particular big government proposal, don’t get defensive and try and stop it .

By putting the government on the defensive, you aut omatically cover the hundreds and thousands of other proposals (which you would o ppose) that you haven’t heard of. You also make your stand clear on the inevitable co mpromise that is bound to come up. Often, a Congressman cites the compromise as a way of getting around your opposition. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 38 By pushing for the LIBERTY AMENDMENT, you automatic ally make a stronger case against any of the brushfire issues ~ without even referring to them by name. A good offense is automatically a good defense. So even if you think that obtaining the Amendment i s a hopeless job, you’re still better off defensively by pushing for the Amendment offensively. No matter how you look at it, you keep coming back to the fact that the LIBERTY AMENDMENT is our best possible weapon. Even if you think it’s unobtainable ~ even if all y ou want to do is wake up people ~ even if you want to fight defensively ~ the LIBERTY AMENDMENT is still the key to getting your particular job done. But, most important, if you want to see victory for our side, the LIBERTY AMENDMENT is the answer. For, really, there’s no reason to think that the LI BERTY AMENDMENT is “too good to be true.” It has already been approved by six states. Thirty- six more are considering it during the legislative sessions of early 1963. It will mos t likely get through one or more states during those sessions. But think of the tremendous advance forward it woul d take if all of us were to get behind it. That doesn’t mean write one letter to your state re presentative and then forget about it. That means putting every bit of time, effort and mo ney you have to spare into this one important solution to all of our problems. So why waste time on the next brushfire battle that comes your way? It’ll be cleared up eventually, when the Amendment is passed. In the meantime, there’s no single way the enemy could destroy us with any one blow. So le t’s steel ourselves to accept the temporary losses we know will occur anyway ~ even i f we were to stop to fight them. Other matters that may not be solved by the Amendme nt will not decide this war one way or the other. And they can all be cleared up a lot easier once the LIBERTY AMENDMENT creates a new climate of freedom in Ameri ca. A whole new world awaits you when you begin to figh t this war positively. You’ll be amazed at just how much brighter things become when you realize where it is you’re going and how you intend to get there.

Everything we do accumulates toward the ev entual victory ~ even if a particular skirmish is not won. So let’s get on the offensive. Let’s make sure that every speech, every letter-to-the- editor, every freedom project presents our proposal ~ undisguised by subtlety or defensiveness.

"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 40 DOES THE LIBERTY AMENDMENT GO FAR ENOUGH? By Harry Browne/Editor Freedom Magazine (Formerly American Progress) Editorial Volume 8, No. 2 March/April, 1963 There are, quite naturally, libertarians in America who do not wholeheartedly endorse the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. It would be strange indeed i f any one program met with universal acceptance ~ even within our own ran ks. And yet, we’d like to feel that even the non-endors ers will accept it as the all- important first step to any goal. Basically, the non-acceptance usually falls within one of two categories: (1) those who think the Amendment goes too far, and (2) those who think it doesn’t go far enough. This would appear to put the LIBERTY AMENDMENT in t he “middle of the road” (heaven forbid!) between two extreme viewpoints (he aven forbid, again!). Those who think the Amendment goes too far usually want to try to “trim” government expenditures, a little at a time, gradua lly bringing about the public acceptance that might someday permit something “as radical as the LIBERTY AMENDMENT.” Meanwhile, those who feel it doesn’t go far enough object that the Amendment doesn’t repeal the tax on corporations, or transfer the post office to private enterprise, or reduce the government still further. It would be out of place for us to pass judgment on each of these various opinions. The important point is that these people are lookin g for ways to replace coercive government action with the voluntary choices of fre e people ~ and that search is commendable. In fact, the same search engages the people who bel ieve the LIBERTY AMENDMENT goes too far, those who feel it doesn’t g o far enough, and those who do support it. We’re all looking for ways to extend human freedom. A COMMON CAUSE Our differences are only ones of degree. And while those differences seem too large to overlook, we still find that we are engaged in a co mmon cause. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 41 And the first step in our common search for less go vernment is to recognize that government is not getting smaller, it is growing la rger. Every session of Congress brings ~ not less government ~ but more government. In the past 12 months, the federal government has e nacted literally thousands of regulations and laws that we would consider to be i nvasions of our freedom. Yet these laws passed without our knowledge. While we were busy fighting those we could see, the government was busy enacting many mo re that we couldn’t see. So, far from beginning a counteroffensive for freed om, we can’t even seem to hold the government still while we apply the pruning shears. This is because our federal government is not limit ed by any organic restrictions. It is free to probe into any areas of individual freedom it desires. It is free to usurp any personal human functions it chooses ~ with no restr ictions. It is the concept of limited government ~ constitutional government ~ that is lacking. Unless the federal government is tied down by the “ chains of the Constitution,” we have no hope of ever keeping it within manageable p roportions so that it can then be reduced. When we look for a boundary line ~ a natural border within which to restrain government ~ we find the Constitution, as written b y our founding fathers, to be the most obvious limitation. And reestablishing it as the limitation will at the same time cut our present government in half. CORRECTION POSSIBLE If you feel that this limitation is too narrow, the n you have the right to go to work to amend the Constitution to give the government more powers. On the other hand, if you believe it gives the gove rnment too much authority you again have the privilege of amending the Constituti on ~ to further reduce the scope of government. Even if the Constitution itself is deemed imperfect , you must still reestablish its superiority over government before you can hope to correct it. Because it is the concept of constitutional government that is important. Go vernment must be limited to the specific authorities delegated by the people who created it. An unlimited government is a certain prelude to dic tatorship. And dictatorships do not allow educational programs aimed at more freedom an d less government. So if we"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 42 patiently pursue our programs of enlightenment, we will soon find our teachings shut off by an all-powerful central government that does n’t permit such heresy. Our first step must be to bind down our rulers with the Constitution. Then we can conduct our educational programs in a more optimist ic atmosphere ~ without a fearful deadline hanging over our heads. No matter what your own goal may be, it’s the princ iple of limited government that must first be established. Even if your objectives are limited to a specific sphere, you still need to bind down the entire government before you can hope to remain secure in your own area. And that’s what the LIBERTY AMENDMENT will do. It w ill institute specific limitations upon government. It will prevent govern ment from roaming past the boundaries of the Constitution. No matter what your objective, this is your weapon of salvation. The LIBERTY AMENDMENT deserves the support of all who love and seek freedom. It goes neither too far nor too short of i ts goal. For its goal is to provide the climate of freedom in which we can all work ~ to wh atever degree we choose ~ for that state of society in which man can develop his capabilities to the fullest. How could any other task be more important?  "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 43 WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTION By Harry Browne/Editor Freedom Magazine (Formerly American Progress) Volume 8, No. 3 May-June, 1963 The Constitution is the literal contract between the people and the government. It is the legal document that spells out the duties, powe rs, and responsibilities of government. Whereas laws passed by Congress are generally restr ictions upon the people, the Constitution is a restriction upon government. It s ets out the boundaries of power ~ beyond which government may not tread. It tells ind ividuals in government what they may do and what they may not do. In the American concept, the people are sovereign. Not collectively sovereign in the sense that a majority of them may inflect their wil l upon the minority. But individually sovereign in the sense that each man is his own mas ter ~ capable of running his own affairs, making his own decisions. INALIENABLE RIGHTS The American way recognizes that each man received precious gifts from his creator ~ the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of ha ppiness. These rights are inalienable ~ not to be given nor taken away by any other man or by government. And as one man hires other men to supply him with p roducts and services, the American people have hired a government to protect these alienable rights. But throughout all history, governments have been i nstruments of oppression: Instead of protecting liberty, they take it away. Instead o f defending man’s life, they tell him how he may live it. George Washington expressed it, “Government is not reason; it is not eloquence. It is force! Like fire, it is a dang erous servant and a fearful master.” So Americans ~ recognizing the nature of government and yet still needing an agency to protect their rights ~ tried a noble experiment. NOBLE EXPERIMENT Our forefathers wrote down the duties of government in a written contract ~ the Constitution. When they were finished, they said to their new government, “Here ~ these are the duties and responsibilities we want y ou to assume, nothing more. This is all you are expected or entitled to do. If we find that we have not given you enough power, we will let you know by amending this Consti tution.”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 44 And they made it absolutely clear in the ninth and tenth amendments to it, that the government had no other powers than those specifica lly stated in the contract. As Thomas Jefferson put it, they had bound their ru lers “down from mischief with the chains of the Constitution.” Freed from the age-old threat of government interfe rence, each American was then inspired to produce more ~ because he knew the frui ts of his labor were his own, not liable to confiscation by a greedy government. As a result, Americans created the greatest, most a bundant civilization every known. And this abundance was the result of a single docum ent, a contract between the people and their historical enemy ~ government. Ame ricans tamed it by binding it down. Today, however, we see that menace reassuming its t raditional proportions. The $100 billion budget, the harassing regulatory agencies a nd restrictive laws are all nothing more than modern forms of the age-old tools of oppr ession. VIOLATIONS OVERLOOKED Government has broken its bonds ~ simply because we , the people, have not vigilantly enforced the contract. We have overlooked violation s because we have felt they were for the “general welfare.” We have failed to recognize that one breach in a co ntract nullifies the value of the entire document ~ and we have thus relinquished our God-given rights of free speech, religion and press. Our greatest task today is to pass the LIBERTY AMEN DMENT ~ reestablishing the Constitution as the literal contract between the pe ople and their government. An era of even greater freedom and prosperity await s that day. Let us prove that it is not too late to earn those rewards.

The quickly-aroused public support, the le gislators climbing on the bandwagon ~ these encouraging, sometimes incredible , developments must look very good from the sidelines. Those who are cheering for the LIBERTY AMENDMENT have been given a great deal to cheer about. But ~ strangely enough ~ from the thick of the batt le, the outlook is not so pleasing. Oh yes, the spectacular progress in Indiana, Florid a and other states justifies a great sense of satisfaction for those in the struggle. Still, there is every reason for disappointment. In every state, the spectacular gains were produced by a relatively small group of people . These dedicated leaders worked day and night ~ to the exclusion of all else to pro duce the legislative and public support that carried the AMENDMENT further than it had ever gone before. In most cases, also, these drives didn’t begin unti l late last fall or early this year. The results were the product of a handful of people wor king for a short time. And those results are spectacular, even amazing, by every conceivable ya rdstick ~ except one: When measured against the potential strength on our side, the pro gress of the AMENDMENT is pitifully inadequate.

With this tremendous reservoir of strength on our side, you w ould expect the AMENDMENT to have been approved by several states this year. But unfortunately, these patriots can only be count ed on to write their state representatives once every two years, to send a dol lar or two to the National Committee annually, and perhaps to pass out a handf ul of yellow cards. And that minimum effort won’t bring victory for the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. Why should this be all that can be expected from pe ople who are putting their very lives and fortunes into the struggle for freedom? W hy shouldn't those who are"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 46 working so hard for liberty put most of their effor t into the one thing that will produce the desired result? Yes, the view from the sidelines is pretty good. T he results are very encouraging. But once you get on the inside and start working for the AMENDMENT, instead of just cheering for it, you quickly realize how close we a re to victory. And then you can’t help but feel a tremendous sense of frustration bec ause the strength needed to win exists, but is not being utilized. AND YOU. . . Where do you stand? Have you been in the thick of the fight thi s year ~ or on the sidelines? Perhaps you’ve considered yourself relat ively active in the struggle. Take stock of yourself by answering these questions: 1. Have you taken the trouble to read Action For Americans ~ so that you’ll be fully informed on the AMENDMENT? 2. Have you been writing letters to newspapers regular ly ~ letters that specifically propose the AMENDMENT? 3. Have you written to state legislators at any other time than when the AMENDMENT was about to be considered? 4. Have you made a personal call to discuss the AMENDM ENT with your state representative? 5. Have you made a really sizeable contribution to the National Committee? 6. Have you distributed a large quantity of materials within the past few moths? 7. Have you helped organize a permanent committee to p romote the AMENDMENT in your area? 8. Have you developed new ideas of your own? These are but a few of the questions that help to d istinguish between the cheering section and the players on the field. How many prom pted a “yes” answer in your mind? We have the most potent weapon any freedom-loving a rmy could hope for. The public wants it ~ the state legislators need it. The feder al bureaucracy has demonstrated that it is incapable of stopping it. In other words, there is nothing in the world to st op us but ourselves.

By Harry Browne/Editor Freedom Magazine (Formerly American Progress) Volume 8, No. 4 July-August, 1963 Today’s “Freedom Army” is many times larger than th e most incurable optimist would have predicted three years ago. And as people become concerned about the future of our free enterprise system and constitutional government, they come to realize tha t the LIBERTY AMENDMENT is the solution. Unfortunately, however, a further step is required. The people who want the LIBERTY AMENDMENT must apply themselves to the task of bringing it about. Only people can accomplish these things ~ and, to date, not enough people are willing to expend the time, energy and money necessary to m ake the AMENDMENT a reality. True, there are undoubtedly millions of people in A merica today who are “all for” the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. And many of them will even say s o, if asked. But how many are actively devoting themselves to the task o f making the AMENDMENT a living part of the Constitution? The AMENDMENT was presented before many state legis latures this year. In most of these states, overwhelming public support was obvio us. But those who favored it left the job of persuading the legislators to a small gr oup of willing workers. Consequently, the AMENDMENT didn’t have the strengt h to go all the way at the time of decision. In Indiana, a small group ~ spurred into action jus t six months ago ~ did a remarkable job. They helped engineer the AMENDMENT through the State House of Representatives, and narrowly missed getting it thr ough the Senate ~ losing by only 21-26. If just three votes had switched we would ha ve won. If only some of those thousands for the AMENDMENT had been willing to help change thos e few votes! In Florida, another determined band of freedom-figh ters helped it pass the State House by 74-75, only to see it sidetracked by a Sen ate committee. Again, only a fraction of the available strength was on duty to h elp. This same story can be repeated over and over again . In Mississippi, last fall, the AMENDMENT won in the Senate, 39 to 4, then missed i n the House by 62-64. It also"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 49 lost by only one vote in the Arizona House this year, and by a tie vote in an important Washington State Committee. One vote ~ two votes ~ four votes ~ in state after state victory was denied by the barest of margins. And all of this was done with ju st a few people carrying the load for all of those who believe in freedom. It’s time for Americans to quit hoping that a few p eople can win this battle. All those who generously say, “I’m sure with you” must be sti mulated to action . We who condemn “something for nothing” schemes must quit asking for “something for nothing” ourselves. It’s time we quit “letting George” fight our freedo m battles for us. If we really want to restore freedom to America ~ if we really want our income tax money to be ours to spend as we see fit ~ then we’d better roll up our sleeves, unzip our pocketbooks, and get to work! The battle is far from over. For the LIBERTY AMENDM ENT can not be defeated ~ it can only be delayed. The 1964 and 1965 legislative battles are already u nderway. In many states, determined organizations are already beginning soun dly-based programs of action to bring victory in the next legislative sessions. You can imagine the dynamic force that will be unle ashed once all those who are for the AMENDMENT will actually do something about it. Are you willing to do more than just write a half-dozen letters every year or two? Are you willing to take the time necessary to become a truly articulate “salesman of liberty”? Are you willing to put your resources and energy in to the one program that is aimed at final victory for freedom? If so, let’s get at it. Don’t wait for the “majorit y” to act. It is the militant minority that changes the course of history ~ the minority that k nows where it is going and is willing to expend the effort to get there.

Surprisingly, there is a way to obtain such a tax exemption. But first, t ake a moment and dream about it. What would you do with your inc ome tax money if it were yours to spend as you see fit? Would you invest that money in a business? Buy a ne w car? Move into a better home? Get that new furniture you’ve been wanting? We’re talking about quite a bit of money, you know. If you make $6,000 per year, you probably pay around $600 in personal income tax. At $10,000 per year, the tax is over $1300. And at $20,000, the tax is almost $4,000 eve ry year. What would you do with that money ~ if it was sudde nly yours to spend? It could add up very quickly into a comfortable ret irement fund. Or maybe you’d like to invest it in stocks and bonds. Or a college educ ation for your child. Maybe you just want to have a good time ~ so you mi ght take a trip to Europe or Las Vegas. Then again, you might prefer to support your church or favorite charity to a much greater degree than you can presently afford.

Let’s examine some other possibilities: Perhaps you’d like to give some of your money to th e Communist dictator of Yugoslavia ~ where a good part of your income tax m oney goes now. Or, instead, would you like to invest in some good farm subsidies? On the average, over $100 of your annual income tax presently goes to subsidize, control or regulate agriculture. In fact, it is 700 such “welfare state” projects th at consume your entire income tax payment every year. Federal ventures like public po wer, farm subsidies, foreign aid,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 52 and pork barrel projects consume more money every y ear than is collected by the personal income tax. None of them are authorized by the Constitution ~ a nd just by eliminating them, we could do without income taxes. The Federal Government receives enough revenue from other taxes to cover our defense needs and all other constitutional requirem ents ~ without the personal income tax! The proposed LIBERTY AMENDMENT ~ already approved b y six states ~ will eliminate the government’s spending sprees and repe al the income tax. It will allow the government three yeas in which to liquidate every o ne of its economic enterprises not specified in the Constitution, and then repeal personal income taxes. So it is possible for you to have a total exemption from pe rsonal income taxes. Let’s start dreaming again. What would you do with that money? It can be yours ~ once the LIBERTY AMENDMENT is ena cted. But your help is needed to make it a reality. Visualize what having your income tax money would m ean to you. Then realize that this would be yours every year for the rest of your working life. That’s how much big government is costing you! And that’s how much you can benefit from the LIBERTY AMENDMENT.

"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 53 YES, WE CAN END GOVERNMENT WASTE By Harry Browne/Editor Freedom Magazine (Formerly American Progress) Editorial Volume 9, No. 1 January-February, 1964 A recent newspaper editorial illustrated the futili ty we often feel when struggling with government waste. The editorial described the Rural Electrification A dministration’s program. It pointed out that REA makes 2% loans to co-op electric compa nies (the same money the government presently borrows at 4%). It cited the c o-op privileged position in being exempt from taxes ~ and it proved that REA had outl ived its usefulness and was just a tax drain. These facts have been brought out often ~ yet the R EA program continues with no hindrance to its annual subsidy. The editorial summed up the futility in its last pa ragraph: “How do you get rid of something like this that has outlived its function? It’s a very difficult thing to do.” This frustration strikes us all ~ and not just in r elation to REA, but to many Federal programs that seem perpetual. No matter how often t hey are discredited, they continue unhindered. The foreign aid program is another example. Denounc ed by millions of Americans ~ and proved to be a failure ~ it continues unabated. Even the opposition to it appears to be merely hoping to keep the bill down to $3 billio n or so. The examples are endless. WHY WE LOSE Why is this so? Can’t we ever arouse enough people to win the fight to eliminate even one of these programs? The answer is simply that we are trying to defeat something with nothing. Each boondoggle has a special-interest group promot ing it. We, on the other hand, never seem to muster enough taxpayers who ~ in thei r own self-interest ~ will oppose these programs. This is because we offer nothing for their trouble in opposing them; while the bureaucracy is offering subsidies to the special-in terest groups supporting them."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 54 Oh sure, the elimination of a billion dollars in Fe deral appropriations will theoretically save each taxpaying family an average of $20 or so.

We find it difficult to explain the injustice of a program ~ and there’s no guarantee t hat ending this one won’t foster another injustice. And, more important, there seems to be not one single reward for his trouble. HOW TO DO IT Only when we oppose something with something can we hope to defeat it. And we already have that “something”. In fact, that “something” is so appealing we can ev en hope to sway the recipients of government subsidies to the cause of freedom. We ca n show them they’d be better off without their subsidies. Our program is the LIBERTY AMENDMENT. The AMENDMENT will force the government to give up all economic enterprises not specified in the Constitution. And the savings to the Federal Budget will be so great, and so permanent, the personal income tax wi ll be repealed. This is the greatest benefit any modern-day America n could be offered. Do you know anyone who would not trade his subsidy for repeal of his income tax? Under the LIBERTY AMENDMENT, everyone benefits from the reduction of government. In fact, the rewards are so great, peop le eagerly study the Constitution and economics to find out how it can be done ~ so t hey can help it. The LIBERTY AMENDMENT provides the incentive for al l Americans to join us in this crusade. It is the only proposal that graphica lly illustrates to every taxpayer exactly what big government is costing him. He doesn’t need to understand the dangers in social ized medicine; he may never be inspired to fight REA subsidies; but he’ll join you in the fight for freedom if you give him an incentive to do so!

Should we ~ or shouldn’t we? Each year, the UN turns down the Communists’ reques t for Red China’s admittance.

By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 26, No. 30 September 9, 1962 In retrospect, it seems incredible that we were abl e to subdue the fascist threat of the early forties. Our foreign policy was amazingly pri mitive ~ compared to today’s more “enlightened” methods of dealing with our enemies. For example: 1. We were too unimaginative to think of giving foreig n aid to Japan and Italy, in hopes of “weaning” them away from Germany. 2. We allowed our generals to carelessly talk about “v ictory” and “winning the war” ~ instead of using less militaristic terms, like “s eeking an accommodation with the Nazis.” 3. We didn’t even think of inviting Adolph Hitler to c ome to our country, stubbornly refusing to give him a propaganda platform from whi ch to discourage his enslaved subjects. 4. We made the mistake of using our resources to fight the enemy ~ instead of utilizing our full weight to defeat pro-American al lies, as we now do with Katanga, Peru, South Korea, the Dominican Republic, Laos, and others. 5. We were super-patriots ~ and probably wouldn’t have tolerated a Nazi-dominated labor union to control the Pentagon communications system, as the Communist- dominated American Communications Association does now. These are just some of the mistakes we made. That p rimitive foreign policy did have one compensation, however: We did win the war! LET’S WIN THIS ONE And isn’t it about time we decided to win this one, too? Isn’t it about time we quit playing with an enemy t hat has promised to bury us? Let’s do what is necessary to win the cold war: 1. We should begin by placing a full embargo on all tr ade with the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. 2. We should quit sending foreign aid to Poland, Yugos lavia, or any other Communist country. This includes giving money to th e U.N. to be relayed to the Communists."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 60 3. We should promptly withdraw diplomatic recognition from all Communist countries. One billion restless slaves behind the I ron Curtain would take that as a sign that we really are on their side. Trade, aid, and recognition ~ the three vital ingre dients in the Communists’ success. Yet we have it within our power to withdraw all thr ee. We can win the cold war if we simply make up our minds to quit helping the enemy. If we would stop supplying the Communists with the things they’re incapable of producing themselves, they could not hold their sla ve empire together for six months. So let’s do what is necessary to bring true peace a nd freedom to the world. Let’ start now to win the cold war! How about telling your representative in government how you feel about this?

By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 27, No. 31 July 30, 1963 “Isn’t the current railroad-union controversy proof that our free enterprise system needs government regulation to function properly?” The impasse over featherbedding ~ between managemen t and union leaders ~ has undoubtedly led many people to wonder if free enter prise can survive without government intervention. The truth, of course, is just the opposite. The rai lroads are not ailing from too much freedom. For years, they’ve had a sever case of too much government . They’ve been denied the opportunity to try free enterprise! EXAMPLE Did you know, for example, that railroads are not a llowed to charge freight rates that are less than the minimums established by the federal gover nment? This raises the prices of products you buy that are shipped by rail . The railroads are also forced to pay exorbitant “social security” type costs under t he Railway Retirement Act. And they’re not even permitted to drop an unprofitable passenger route or merge companies without government consent. On top of this, they are compelled by law to bargai n with union leaders who have virtual immunity from taxation, court injunction or the local laws against violence and trespassing. All of these federally-imposed roadblocks exclude t he railroads from the free society guaranteed to all of us by the Constitution. OBVIOUS SOLUTION With these facts in mind, solutions to our present- day railroad problems are obvious. We must take the government out of railroad regulat ion, repeal the unfair privileges enjoyed by union leaders, and allow the railroads t o compete for their sales and profits on the basis of service to their customers ~ as is the tradition in a capitalist nation. The result will be better service and lower prices to all transportation customers. For now the railroads will be free to cut costs and low er rates. Even union workers will be better off. Their job se curity will be based upon true need for their services, instead of temporary union tyra nny over the employer."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 62 FACTS The free enterprise system produces greater service and a higher standard of living for everybody. In a free system, you must serve your customer or employer in order to receive his money. While in the welfare state, prof its and job security depend upon political manipulations ~ which injure our standard of living. When we realize the extent of artificial government intervention into o ur economy, it’s no wonder that we’re having such a tough time “getting the country moving.” Let’s repeal the socialist-style welfare-state laws that are holding back progress.

Yes! This is what our traditional American free ent erprise system offers us. In a free economy, there is always a need for someone who wan ts to work. For evidence of that, just look in the help wanted section of this newspaper. You may not find the job you want most or the salar y you dream of. Who does? But people don’t starve to death in America because the capitalist system will always supply some kind of job at a livable wage. SUPPLY AND DEMAND At the same time, the miraculous private enterprise system automatically takes into consideration the real needs and wants of the consu mer. A premium is thereby placed on work that is really needed, while others see low ering wages as an inducement to give up work that is no longer in demand. This natural supply-and-demand system keeps everyon e at work ~ and keeps production geared to our needs and wants. Why, then, is there so much unemployment today? Wha t has thrown this great system out of balance? WAGE FIXING Basically, there are three main causes of our prese nt unemployment. First, minimum wage laws keep some people ~ who are not worth the fixed minimum ~ out of work permanently. The man whose value is only $1 per hou r is not going to be hired by a firm that is forced to pay $1.25 per hour. Second, government unemployment-insurance systems f orce employers to contribute to a fund that tempts workers to remain unemployed. Why take a less-than-perfect job at $80 per week when you can draw $60 per week for not working? If the system were voluntary ~ supported by the wor ker’s own savings ~ there would be more incentive to work. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 64 Third, the government has granted special privilege s to labor union leaders to permit them to force wage rates up to unrealistic levels. As with minimum wage laws, this forces the employer to make up the difference by hi ring fewer people. CAPITALIST SYTEM Full employment will come when we reclaim the capit alist system that is our heritage. We should eliminate minimum wage laws, transfer une mployment insurance to a private, voluntary system, and require unions to co mpete on the basis of service, rather than political advantage. Then there will be jobs available for all who want them. Production will be geared to the real desires of the people ~ and can help move our standard of living ever upward.

It was a foregone conclusion, of course, that no co mmercial banker in his right mind would trust the Soviets for even one week. And neit her would any private agency be willing to guarantee that the Soviets will pay the bills. POOR BUSINESS But the American taxpayers are now going to be forc ed to guarantee the Soviets’ payments ~ because the Export-Import Bank is financ ed by us. Obviously, this guaranteeing of Communist debts is not “good busine ss” ~ as its backers proclaim ~ for if it were good business some private company w ould be doing it to make the profit involved. So why force the American people to do it? In fact, why force the American people to guarantee FHA loans at interest rates lower than so und policy would justify? And why force us to subsidize farmers and foreign governmen ts and low-interest REA loans? If the benefits from these various programs are as great as we are told, why must anyone be forced to support them? If an enterprise is owned and ope rated by individuals, then the customers who benefit from it willingly pay the costs involved. But when government owns the enterprise, everyone i s forced to pay for it ~ whether or not they benefit. Is the Export-Import Bank (or any other agency) rea lly beneficial? If so, turn it loose from government and let those who benefit pay its c osts. If it doesn’t provide real service, it will eventually die from non-support. BY FORCE The key word in all this is force . There is a basic economic truth involved : If an enterprise has to be operated by the government, it can only be because its benefits are to be derived by forcing others to pay for them . For government possesses only one asset ~ force ~ that is not available to privat e enterprise. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 66 The proposed Liberty Amendment to the Constitution will put an end to forced support. It will require the federal government to give up every economic enterprise not specified in the Constitution.

If foreign aid, farm subsidies, electricity projects, lending agencies, etc. are worthy projects, they will continue after the Amendment is passed. B ut if they don’t really have the support of the people, they will simple “fade away. ” OUR CHOICE The Liberty Amendment will restore the citizen’s ri ght to judge for himself what is worthy and what isn’t. When enacted, everyone can m ake his own decision to give to foreign aid or farm subsidies, to pay the costs of the Export-Import Bank or the REA ~ and no one will be forced to contribute to projects of which he does not app rove.

By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 28, No. 4 January 28, 1964 Do you have money invested in a savings account, in surance policy, pension plan or social security? If so, your financial future is in serious jeopardy ! The value of your savings is solely dependent upon the continuing course of inflation in America. That retirement income of $300 or $500 per month might look very adequate right now. But by the time you retire, its purchasing power can shrink to only $50 or $100 per month. Could you live on that? The stakes of inflation are enormous. If it continu es, you may spend your “retirement” years working harder than you do today ~ or imposin g a frightful burden on your children. Is this what you want? The cause of inflation is simple. It is not high pr ices ~ that’s just the effect of it. DEFINITION Inflation is a condition in which the government fe eds new paper money into the nation’s economy to pay expenses for which no taxes have been raised. For example, if the government collects $85 billion in taxes ~ but spends $90 billion ~ it must make up the $5 billion from somewhere. It s ells bonds to the Federal Reserve System, which pays for them with new Federal Reserv e Notes. These notes look and feel just like other money, but have no value of th eir own ~ because they are not backed up by gold or silver. And since these new bills have no real value of the ir own, all other money in circulation inevitably decreases in value until the total money supply once again equals the assets backing it up. So that $5 billion extra that the government spends will eventually cost the taxpayers $5 billion in new inflation. Even though the costs of government don’t appear to come out of your tax bill, they do come out of the value of your savings account, insurance policy or paycheck. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 68 NEW THREAT In the last twenty years, your savings have already been cut in half by inflation. And ~ far from slowing down ~ it is now beginning to spee d up. New one dollar bills have just been put in circulation ~ without gold or silv er backing. In addition, the government is anxiously pushing a “tax cut” that is not accompanied by a cut in spending. His means more inflation is f orthcoming to make up the deficit in the government’s budget. Together, these two developments signal a massive i ncrease in the rate of inflation ~ unless we act now to reverse the trend. Three major steps are required to restore economic sanity to our nation: THREE STEPS 1. Passage of the Liberty Amendment will cut governmen t expenditures to those authorized by the Constitution only. 2. A prohibition on paper money not backed by gold or silver will further check the government’s temptations to spend. 3. The citizen’s right to personally own gold must be reestablished. This provides additional protection against inflationary governme nt policies. If you don’t have a savings account, insurance poli cy, pension plan or fixed income, don’t worry about all this. But if you do ~ then is n’t it time you acted to protect your own future? If you don’t, someday you’ll be wondering “What hap pened to my savings account?”  "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 69 HOW TO MAKE UNIONS BEHAVE By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 28, No. 2 March 17, 1964 Recent events have focused attention once again on labor union power, sparking renewed demands for corrective measures. In Florida and California, lengthy strikes have pro duced acts of sabotage against companies that continued operating during strikes. The new Teamster contract with the trucking industry raises the threat of a nation wide transportation strike. And the AFL-CIO’s Committee on Political Education is prepa ring to use union members’ dues in the coming elections. What can be done about all this? How do we take the violence out of labor relations? How do we prevent power being exercised by a Jimmy Hoffa ~ or the spending of union members’ money on candidates not of their cho osing? Do we need new restrictive legislation? NATURE OF UNIONS First, we must understand the nature of unions and the cause of their power. What is a union? Is it legal? Is it right? Let’s look into it . Any group of workers has a right to get together an d face the boss with an ultimatum of “higher wages or we quit.” If the boss says “no” , the group can walk out ~ and can even picket on the sidewalk, so long as it does not interfere with the liberties of others. If, after a few days, the workers want to c ome back, they can return to the boss and ask to return to their jobs. Obviously, they ca nnot demand their jobs back; neither can the boss demand their return. This “collective bargaining” is a natural outgrowth of one man’s employment by another. Unions have been created as a private ente rprise service to represent employees in these negotiations. In a free climate, the unions would grow ~ as any business does ~ only in relation to the amount of g enuine service it offers its customers ~ the employees. Unfortunately, however, unions have obtained specia l laws that give them powers that other individuals and groups do not have. This has enabled them to coerce employers and employees in unnatural ways. For example, it is against the law for an employer to fire an employee because he’s a union member ~ but it’s legal to fire one because h e’s not a union member. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 70 SPECIAL UNION POWERS In addition, the federal government has created a w hole new concept called the “right to strike.” This differs from the “right to quit” i n that the union can call a strike and then force the employer to rehire all employees whe n the strike is over. There are many other examples of special powers tha t government has granted to unions. As a result, they don’t grow by serving ~ b ut instead by special legislation that gives hem the power to coerce. The many different problems concerning unions could be solved simply by returning unions to a free enterprise status. When all federal labor legislation has been repeale d, unions will be forced to provide real services to their members. If they have no rea l service to offer, they will simply pass from sight ~ without government help to keep t hem alive. If they do have a service to offer, they will have the opportunity to prove it.

But while the bickering goes on, the poor businessm an continues ~ in his own way ~ creating needed goods and services, providing jobs, raising our standard of living. No politician consults him for his opinion. And tha t’s just as well. For a true capitalist asks for no special favors ~ he merely wants to be left alone to carry out his work. What possible moral justification is there for allo wing economically-illiterate Congressmen to set wage rates for American industry ?

Why doesn’t the government do something about the money shortage? Why not print enough money so that no one will have to work again ? Sound ridiculous? Of course! ITS REAL VALUE In the first place, money is not wealth; it is only a means of exchange. Real wealth consists of such things as goods and services, pers onal property. The value of money is only in what it will purchase. What good is a mi llion dollars if inflation cuts its buying power to one loaf of bread? You and I know that the only way you can have anyth ing is to work for it. To have things, you must produce them ~ or produce somethin g you can exchange for what you want. We realize that the more money there is i n circulation, the less each dollar will buy.

No, money trees are not for us. They’re for childre n reading fairy tales and for politicians ~ but not for grown-up men and women.

By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 4, No. 47 November 23, 1965 “It is hard to live by one’s principles. It is alwa ys easier to give in to temptation and be like others.” Do those words sound familiar? I’ve read them and h eard them often. The man who says it is difficult to live by princip le does not really understand his own principles. For living by principle should be the e asiest task in the world. What is a principle? It is simply an unchanging fac t of life that one recognizes. The object of living by principle is to realistical ly obtain more of what you want in life ~ whatever that may be. So you formulate a set of principles as guideposts to follow in order to obtain what you want. If you have thought out your principles for yoursel f, they will be fully consistent with the real world as it is, and with your goals in lif e. In this case, living by them is not difficult ~ but violating them would be very hard t o do, because you’d be unwilling to accept the consequences of violating what you know to be the truth. For example, is it wrong to lie? Once a man has det ermined for himself that it is wrong, he will have no trouble being honest thereaf ter. For he knows that to violate this principle will bring unpleasant reactions ~ th e fear of being discovered, the disrespect of others, etc. On the other hand, if he finds it difficult to be h onest, it simply means he has never fully understood the consequences of dishonesty tha t would apply in every case. To be livable, a principle must be consistent with the real world. For example, the tenet “live your life completely for others” would be impossible to live by. Anyone who tries to do so will inevitably experience frust ration. Why? Because the “principle” is not realistic. Ever y man lives for himself and what he feels is meaningful. To live for others is conce ptually impossible. Whatever a man’s motives, they are all part of sati sfying his own objectives. The man who devotes himself to charity is only attempting t o satisfy his own motivations ~ perhaps even to the exclusion of others who can con ceive of “better charities”.

If you believe you are living by principle ~ but find yourself sometimes envying tho se who don’t live by yours ~ then you should seriously consider adopting their principles.

While it is certainly true that one’s mental outloo k will color his method of expression, it is also true that most declarations of the doctrine of “positive thinking” far overstep the bounds of reality. The overstepping takes place in forgetting that eac h individual controls only himself. If I “think positively” when I arise in the morning , I may very well express a cheerfulness and optimism that will make people enj oy being around me during the day. But if my “positive thinking” intrudes into the rea lm of believing that I will sell John Jones a certain item today, or that my business ass ociates will have more confidence in me today, or that the stock market will go up to day ~ in each of these cases I am trying to think positively about something over whi ch I have no control. For John Jones has his own life ~ just a fully as I do. He has his own plans and aspirations ~ just as intensely sought after as I d o. He will buy my products today only if what I sell fits into his plans, and if I’m capable of communicating that ap plicability to him. To expect that my thoughts will change his plans and ambitions is to live in a dream world. Actually it is a dream world of total chaos where nothing is firm ~ where everyone’s thoughts and actions are subject t o the whims of other individuals’ positive or negative thoughts. And, in the same way, my business associates have their own lives. They will react favorably to me only as I offer them something of m yself that will enhance their own plans and ambitions. And it goes without saying tha t the action of the stock market will be the result of the mental attitudes of liter ally millions of individuals today ~ rather than my positive or negative attitude. So does it matter what one’s mental outlook is? Of course. As mentioned before, one’s method of expression, his personality, his de sirability as a companion or associate will be colored by his mental attitude. P eople, in general, do not like to be around other people who are gloomy, hostile, or unc ooperative. So the proper attitude has its positive results ~ b ut not because “thinking makes it so”, but because of the actions one takes as a result of his attitude. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 82 But there is a limit to this. For, once again, we m ust recognize that you only control yourself. If your attitude is positive, your manner direct an d courteous, your mood cooperative ~ but still the other individual does n ot respond ~ that is his business. You can’t make him want what you have to offer. And even if it se ems that he should want ~ for his own good ~ what you’re offering, if he fa ils to see it, that’s his problem. Each of us has one life to live ~ all his own. He d oes not control the actions or thoughts of any other individual. The only area for improvement is self -improvement, for the only person one controls is himself. Theref ore, your mental attitude will have an effect upon your actions. But the worst mistake an individual can m ake is to believe he is responsible for the actions of others .

He wanted to know whether to be optimistic or pessimistic. “There is a great deal of improvement,” I said. “Where?” he asked. “I haven’t seen it. Where is the improvement?” “In me!” I answered. And it’s true ~ I am improving. My outlook is bette r. My knowledge and understanding are broadening. My decisions seem to be more wisely considered; my temper has almost completely disappeared; and my ec onomic situation, though shaky at times, is generally going upwards. In short, I’m finding improved ways of running my own life. “But what in the world has that got to do with the general shape of things?” he demanded to know. My answer: “Everything.” My whole life is me ~ I am the only person I will ever be. My decisions are the only ones I’ll ever make; my actions are the only ones I’ll ever control. What else is there in this world that I co uld realistically expect to improve but me? Unwilling to give up the fight, my friend persisted : “But that’s not enough. While ‘every day in every way you’re getting better and b etter’, the world is going to the dogs. Our present national monetary policy is ruini ng our currency. Don’t you think you’d better be concerned about that? “But I am concerned. I’m so concerned that I’ve taken steps to educate myself and protect myself against these policies. The men who are controllin g matters in Washington are far beyond my control; but I’m not. So, even though I can’t change the monetary policy, I can make sure my own propert y and investments are properly protected.” Self-improvement does not mean ignoring the world around you. It means recognizing the world around you ~ and recognizing the intenti ons and motivations of others, and how those factors will affect you. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 84 But self -improvement is based upon one very important premi se: that you only control yourself . It doesn’t matter how warped someone else’s “mora lity” might be. It is not in my power to change him. It’s true he might respond favorably to my arguments; but he also has the power to reject what I say. So I ca nnot be responsible for his actions or morality. But I am responsible for my actions. And if I fail to prote ct myself because I’m so busy pointing my finger at others, I’ve only myself to blame. If I see that others are doing wrong, my first responsibility is to protect myself from their actions; then , if I choose, make an attempt to show them the error of t heir ways. Self-improvement doesn’t mean hiding one’s head in the sand. To the contrary, it means becoming aware of the world and the interacti on between yourself and others. It means using every avenue to improve one’s situat ion ~ using the sound principles of economics to improve one’s own status ~ refusing the government’s handouts and “services” and relying only upon one’s own controll able self. So there is improvement these days ~ improvement in the only a rea about which I can realistically report ~ me. I control myself and no one else. The only way I can be sure there will be improvement is to manufacture it in m yself. You can improve others only as they voluntarily cho ose to hear or read what you have to say.

Suppose you could be virtually certain that no one would ever know that you had taken it. Would you steal it? In other columns, I have written about the poor res ults that come from stealing, from accepting stolen money in the form of government su bsidies. So, for brevity sake, I will not repeat my argument s for not stealing in this column. But rather, let’s summarize them by saying that any act that interfers coercively with another individual will immediately initiate a reac tion that will go against you. Your success in life depends upon your ability to help o thers get what they want ~ because this is what induces them to give you what you want . The individual who provides service of positive val ue to others is always in demand ~ because those others will not want to have to get a long without him. But now back to the original question. Suppose no o ne would ever know that you had stolen, or lied, or in some way hurt another indivi dual. Is there any purely practical way to prove that this is understandable for the in dividual? Yes there is. Just as you can never expect to be a concert pianist without practicing when you’re all alone, so could you never be a succ essful individual in public without practicing in private. Your success depends upon your ability to provide p eople with what they want. This takes more than desire on your part; it takes pract ice, technique, acquired talent. You begin by understanding what you must do to succeed. Then you practice it ~ as a way of life. You refrain from stealing in private ~ just as you would restrain from stealing in public. You are pleasant to strangers ~ just as you would be pleasant to friends. You develop an attitude toward the individuals in this world that is all-e ncompassing, a way of life. You are determined to provide people with what they want ~ so that they will, in turn, prefer your services to alternatives that might exist for them . "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 86 You respect any individual who has not proven himse lf unworthy of that respect. That doesn’t mean you trust him with your life savings ~ only that your attitude toward him precedes your determination that he personally migh t be a profitable element in your life. When the most profitable opportunity of your lifeti me arrives, you’re ready for it. You’re capable of responding immediately with a cod e of conduct that is by then a natural part of your life. You don’t need to reorde r your life suddenly to take advantage of an opportunity that depends upon your honesty, your respect and your ability to be of service to others. And your rewards are great ~ because you are a rare individual, one whose ability to help others get what they want is very unique. Such an individual will always be in great demand. He will have his pick of the most golden opportunities. He is like the athlete who ha s trained himself rigorously for years to be ready for his Olympic contest. When the moment of victory arrives, he knows that every moment of training has been well s pent. Is it unprofitable to steal ~ even when no one know s you’re stealing? Of course, because it diminishes your genuine ability to serve others and reap the rewards ~ no matter what the nature of the rewards you seek.  "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 87 ACTS HAVE CONSEQUENCES By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 5, No. 21 May 24, 1966 Every act has a consequence. Everything you do will have some effect upon the future course of your life. Those acts we would call “good” are those that prod uce good consequences; and bad acts produce bad consequences. In the same way, every decision involves a price. T here is always a price to be paid for anything obtained in life. That price may be pa id in time, energy, money, loss of pride, or it may be paid in the foregoing of anothe r alternative that must be given up in order to make this decision. Life is a series of alternatives staring one in the face. Individuals are constantly choosing among all the alternatives available to th em. Efficiency in decision-making comes from recognizin g in advance the consequences of one’s acts and realistically appraising the pric e. Only in this way can the individual make decisions that will not be tinged with regret later. Only by recognizing consequences in advance can he avoid harmful conseq uences in his life. When this is realized, it becomes apparent just how responsible the individual is for his own welfare. He may point the finger at others, blame adverse circumstances, etc., but he is where he is today as a result of his own choices. He did not make choices for others ~ but he did cho ose for himself. He chose to associate with individuals he may judge to be undes irable; but he didn’t have to choose to be with them. There were always alternati ves available to him ~ and if he chose this road, he has no one to blame but himself . Perhaps he did it out of ignorance. If so, he simpl y decided he would act on the knowledge he had ~ rather than to make an investmen t in additional knowledge. That was his decision. Blaming others is a waste of time. There are bad people who would cheat you if they could; there are undesirable people. But no amount of finger-pointi ng, moralizing, or legislation is going to eliminate those people. The refore, your most effective course of action is to analyze your acts in advance ~ and avoid the circumstances in which “bad” people are in a position to harm you. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 88 Analyze your course of action from the standpoint o f the risks involved. What will this make you vulnerable to? In what way might bad consequences come from this decision? True self-government is to protect yourself in adva nce by assuming the responsibility for every act you commit ~ and by recognizing that you will pay for every mistake you make.

By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 5, No. 23 June 7, 1966 Do you ever get a little sick from finding yourself in the position of having to say something you don’t really believe ~ simply because the consequences of speaking the truth appear to be unattractive? Do you find yourself in the position of having to a ct in some way other than what you really want ~ simply because a previous mistake in your life is now in the way of what you want? There is a product on the market that may cure thes e ills for you. It’s been available for years ~ but few people ever really give it a tr y. It’s called Living.

You cannot base your philosophy, your moral code, your ethics or your actions upon t he premise that someone else can be made to do something. You control only yourself. You cause others to act only as they choose to act. You persuade others only as they choose to be persuaded . Only your life can be molded by your aspirations and beliefs.

Begin by asking yourself who you are, where you’re headed, w hy, and what you hope to gain from it. Ask yourself if this is the most you could do with this one life you have to live. Challenge every principle you’ve ever accepted. Exa mine every important act you’ve committed and ask yourself if it really enhanced wh at you are.

"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 91 PAY THE PRICE By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 5, No. 25 June 21, 1966 The key to good decision-making is in recognizing the price . The reason we find ourselves in the position of mak ing decisions is because there is more than one alternative available to us in a give n case. Therefore, one must choose . Once having made a choice, many people find themsel ves continually in the position of having to look back over their shoulders, wonder ing if perhaps a mistake has been made. How do you avoid the regret and uncertainty that of ten follows an important decision? The key is in recognizing the price that must always be paid. If there were not any alternatives to each possible decision, then there would be no necessity to make a decision. So you begin by recognizing that there ar e alternatives involved. You identify the benefits that may be derived from each possible course of action ~ and you determine what the maximum vulnerability ma y be to yourself. That means you ask “What is the worst possible thing that coul d happen to me if I act I this way?” If the vulnerability is too great a loss for you to take, don’t tell yourself “it might not happen”. If you’re vulnerable for it, take the atti tude that it will happen. So you must then reduce the vulnerability before go ing ahead with that course of action. But never ignore that vulnerability. The pe ople who have accidents, who suffer great damage to themselves, can invariably tell you that it was someone else’s fault. But they would not have suffered the damage in the first place if they had recognized in advance that they were vulnerable to it. Once the best course of action is apparent, then lo ok again at the other alternatives that you are now going to pass up. These are the price ~ this is what you will go without for having made the choice you did. And the re is always a price in rejected alternatives. Look at the price carefully, recognize its full imp lications, know that you are going to go without these things, realize in advance the reg ret you may feel in the future. Then look again at the choice you have made. Is it worth the price? If it is, then act ~ knowing what you are getting for what it is costing you. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 92 The first time you get the temptation to look with nostalgia or regret at that which you have given up, recognize again what you have receiv ed for that price. On this basis, it is very, very difficult to ever suffer any regret o r wonderment at your own decision. You know what you’re getting and you know what it i s costing you. You are paying the price ~ but you’re paying it willingly because what you’re getting for it is so much more important to you. Those who are indecisive and full of later regrets are those who refuse to pay the price. They never accept it. Instead, they are secr etly wishing they could have everything. But you can’t. Therefore, you must know what the price is to you and be willing to pay it. Once having done so, you find yourself moving forwa rd toward greater things ~ unhindered by looks at the past and regrets.

By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 5, No. 30 July 26, 1966 A human being is born into this world with morality , without standards, without knowledge, without purpose. He knows nothing about where he came from or where he is going. He only knows that he is here. And soo n enough he comes to recognize in himself a feeling of mental well-being that we call happiness . And, conversely, he recognizes the mental discomfort that results from unpleasant circumstances. Once having identified the difference between happi ness and unhappiness, he directs all his decisions toward making his life happy and removing unhappiness from it. The method by which he pursues that happiness will depe nd upon the knowledge he has of what truly brings happiness. The ignorant individual, for example, may believe t hat he can only gain happiness by taking things forcibly from others. A more percepti ve individual might realize the value or arranging mutually-profitable exchanges th at makes others happy in the bargain. But the fact remains that the individual will seek happiness in the way that his knowledge leads him. He is not all-knowing or all-w ise; he is restricted by his own limited knowledge. He may come to depend for advice upon those who app ear to have greater knowledge than he has. But it is still his limited knowledge that dictates the choice of advi sor. He may believe that there is a life in the hereafte r and that God will grant him entrance to that life only if he abides by a certai n code. In order to gain that eternal happiness, he tries to live up to that code. On the other hand, he may believe that all happines s must be found here on earth. If so, he will construct his life to obtain the maximu m happiness right here and now. In both of these cases, the same principle applies. The individual is doing what he thinks will bring him the maximum happiness. And his morality is the code of conduct he follows in order to efficiently obtain happiness for himself. Once that morality is firmly established in his min d, he can be relied upon to at least try to live up to it ~ because he has every selfish reason in the world to want to do so."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 94 It matters not from where he derived that morality, it is his ~ and his self-interest prods him to live up to it, because that is the way he believes he’ll find happiness. It is obvious, then, that morality is individually- derived. You cannot impose your morality upon another ~ because his background and knowledge have led him to believe a certain course of action will produce hap piness for him. Only through increased knowledge can you alter his morality ~ and only if his present knowledge inspires him to accept the increased know ledge you offer him. If an individual’s brand of morality seems dangerou s to you (he steals or murders to gain happiness, for instance), then you will not ge t anywhere by passing moral judgment on him. Your morality ~ if it is in any sense practica l ~ should tell you to protect yourself from that individual. That is the only an swer to differences in moral standards. Differences in morality will remain with us as long as no two individuals are alike ~ and that, we trust, will be forever. Does your morality take that into consideration? Or does it depend upon convincing others to act as you do? And, lastly, is your morality the product of your mind? Or has someone convinced you that your mind is not important . . . that your mind, like your appendix, was given to you at birth ~ but serves no real purpose?

By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 5, No. 33 August 16, 1966 “The sins we do two by two Are paid for one by one.” My memory may fail me slightly with regard to the p hrasing of the above adage, but the point has hung onto me for years. It is easier to commit a sin than to pay the price for it. Every act has a consequence. Good acts have good co nsequences. Sins produce misery ultimately to the sinner. The crucial point is when the price of the first sin comes due. Then the individual will either accept h is punishment as the price of clearing the record, or he will attempt to evade th e price by committing the second sin. Since it often seems easier to commit the second sin, they rapidly moun t ~ “two by two.” What is a sin? Men have wrestled with this question for ages. Ulti mately, there can be only one answer ~ a subjective one ~ rendered from your viewpoint as a happiness-seeking human being. A sin is any mistake that you make, im pairing your ability to gain happiness for yourself. If you make the mistake of putting yourself in the position where you can fall off a ledge, you have sinned. And you will pay for this s in through the pain that will result. You will minimize your punishment if you accept it as the inevitable consequence of your own acts. You will compound the ultimate punis hment if you try to excuse your own acts and refuse to face the reality of the situ ation. This will only heighten the possibility of your repeating the mistake. If you make the mistake of lying to another individ ual, you will pay for this sin in the discomfort and pressure it will place upon you. Als o, when you are found out, you will be punished in the market place of human relat ionships; you will lose opportunities you possessed before being classified as a liar. At that point, you can acknowledge your mistake and accept your punishment. Unfortunately, the temptation is to lie again ~ hop ing to ward off the price of the first lie. Because this is such an inviting possibility, sins often mount up “two by two.” "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 96 But it is not profitable to commit the second sin. As discomforting as it may be to have to acknowledge one’s mistake, it is the fastes t way toward neutralizing the price of the mistake and moving toward a happier life. Have I made unsound decisions regarding my business , my family or my future? Then it will always be less expensive to my reputation and well-being to admit those mistakes right now ~ instead of trying to invent bogus principles to justify them. Yes, it is terrifying sometimes to face the punishment coming due for one’s sins. But nature ~ the reality of the world as it is ~ will n ever be denied. So there is something worse than facing the price of one’s sin: And that is to pay the price of that sin plus the price of the cover-up sin that followed it.   "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 97 CAN YOU SAY “I”? By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 5, No. 35 August 30, 1966 How easy it is to make statements such as “I believ e...” of “I think... or “I love you,” etc. But the ease with which such statements are ma de demonstrates a fundamental problem ~ that the importance of “I” has been over looked. What does the word “I” in the above phrases represe nt? When you say “I believe...,” who is the “I” that is doing the talking? Socrates said “Know thyself” ~ which is, of course, a life-long task. The “I” that is casually used in conversation is really the summati on of a multitude of beliefs, experiences, ideas and attitudes. It is a label tha t is placed upon a totally unique entity ~ the human being doing the talking. Each individual is different from all others. He is different because he has lived a different life, thought different thoughts, experie nced different circumstances ~ all different from those of any other human being. No m atter how close two people may be, each will be living his own life ~ although the other may be an important element in that life. When the individual opens his mouth to utter the wo rd “I”, he is referring to that unique human being, unlike any other. And here is t he point: Just how well does the individual understand that “I” when he expresses an opinion on behalf of it? Just how much does he really know about himself? How qualified is he to use the world “I”? Can he say something o n behalf of “I” and make it stick? Does he know himself well enough to be able to exp ress a truly honest thought that really represents this unique “I”? For example, when he says “I believe...,” is it becau se he has thought this out for himself, in terms of his life, his view of reality, his thought processes? Or is he really expressing someone else’s opinion and labeling it “ I”? If he has surveyed the world around him, put two and two together and logically deduced a view of that world, then he can say “This is what I believe” ~ even if someone else first suggested th is view to him. For now it will be something he is sure of, so mething he has proved for himself. Now he has an “I” to express. When he says, “I love you,” is he speaking for some one he really knows? Is he saying, in effect, “I understand myself, I know what life m eans to me, and I know that you are"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 98 the person who gives my life meaning and purpose”? For it all begins with “I”. One must understand who “I” is before he can say “I lov e you.” Know and understand the nature of yourself. If your morals, your philosophy, your attitudes have been formulated as your code of conduct ~ because of what you see in this world ~ then the word “I” when you say it will be meaningful. It will express honestly the viewpoint and intentions of that uniqu e individual that is you . But if you have not yet taken the trouble to unders tand yourself, others will to accept your statements at face value. For they will come t o realize that the “I” of whom you speak is not totally reliable or sure of himself.

I’m sure we will bring order to an otherwise chaotic medical market.” “That’s interesting,” I said, “Tell me, what ~” “Excuse me,” he interrupted as we walked through th e building, “I see this hallway is blocked by backed-up mailbags; we’ll have to go out side and enter from another direction.” “Why are the mailbags stacked up here in the hall?” , I asked. “Well, it’s just a small matter. You see, we have n one of the problems that plague private enterprise. That’s why we’re so much more e fficient. We don’t have to concern ourselves with employee relations or consum er demand or any of those reactionary free enterprise shibboleths.” “What’s a shibboleth?” I asked. “And so,” he went on, “when we found we were paying too much overtime, we just plain cut it out. Slash!” I ducked a karate swing h e was making for emphasis. “Just like that we saved untold amounts of money. Of cour se, there’s a small storage problem as we figure out what to do with the mail t hat’s backed up. “Ah here,” he said as we entered another hallway, a lso loaded with mail sacks, “We can get through here. I’m sure.” He pulled a mail sack out of the solid wall of sack s and we crawled through the hole into the main workroom of the Post Office.

They would have to make a profit, you know. That’s another one of those free enterprise shibboleths.” “What’s a shibboleth?” I asked. “Of course,” he went on, “what you see here is only about one-third of the staff. There are twice as many more upstairs in those tunnels, b ehind the two-way mirrors. Those people spy on the ones down here to make sure that everything is safe and sound.” “What are some of the other lines your company mark ets?” “Oh, I couldn’t begin to tell you all of them. But we’re in electric power generation, loans to just about everyone, urban renewal, overse as charities, agriculture ~ you name it, we’re in it. And you might not believe it, but some of those divisions are even more efficiently-run than this one.” “I find that hard to believe,” I said, climbing ove r a loose stack of mail that had piled up in the center of the floor. As I climbed down th e other side, I brushed the cobwebs off of me and we resumed our conversation. “The really exciting developments,” he went on, “ar e in our new lines. We’re in the poverty business now, you know. And we’re getting r eady to produce special demonstration cities.” “Oh, I see. You’re going to produce cities that are specially made for demonstrations and riots?” I received no answer, only a look of contempt for w hat apparently was my ignorance. We finally said goodbye and I climbed back through the escape hole in the stack of mail-sacks in the front lobby of the Post Office. I returned to my office and wrote my article ~ poin ting out that any company as big and powerful as U.S. Government was bound to be eff icient. And from the way the mail is stacking up in the Chicago Post Office, any thought that their new lines would not be efficient and exciting was just a . . . just a . . . well, just a shibboleth.

There can be no question but what the overall size and scope of government will increase in the next two years. This means federal government and also those closer to home. It is apparent that the new lineup of office-holders will vote even larger taxes and appropriations than their predeces sors did. 2. In some isolated cases, men pledged to platforms of reduced taxes and spending were elected. But it is obvious that most of these men will have to “go along” with the bulk of the orthodox functions of government ~ no matter how repugnant to themselves ~ in order to consolidate their position s in office. 3. Party labels will mean even less during the next tw o years than they have in the past. The Republican victories, for example, do not mean necessarily less government in those cases. For the Republicans are just as vulnerable to the demands of staying in office as are Democrats. And no one yet has ever proven to a politician that cutting accepted government progr ams is a way of perpetuating himself in office. 4. An analysis of the particular individuals who were elected will show that each of them has his pet projects that are designed to incr ease governmental control over your life. For instance, several have said they wan t to hold the line on spending (not cut it, but merely hold the line), while at th e same time promoting some program to increase governmental control through an ti-pornography regulation or tighter controls on unions or inhibiting trade. The sum and substance of very careful analysis of t he election returns must be this: no matter what your political persuasion, there is ver y little reason for new optimism or pessimism. For things are going to continue onward “as usual” ~ with little change in the drift of the nation. As you review the election returns, do the above co mments make sense to you? Do you get the same impression as I do ~ once you clos ely investigate the attitudes and platforms of the victorious candidates? I thought y ou would. But perhaps I should tell you that this analysis wa s written November 1 ~ one week prior to the election. And yet I am positive that m y conclusions will be borne out before the two-year period affected by the election is over. For I am merely calling attention to the obvious ~ that it doesn’t really matter who is elected, the result will be the same.

Did even the famous 80 th “do nothing” Congress bring about greater freedom for u s? Did the election of the famous Max Rafferty in California reduce or alter the cour se of the gigantic, tyrannical state education system in California? If Ronald Reagan has been elected governor of Calif ornia, I predict that the size of the state budget will be at least 25 percent larger wit hin two years. If Republicans somehow won control of the House of Representatives, I predict an increase in “defense” and “great Society” costs. And if neither of those two things happened, I pred ict the same results. For 177 years, the nation has been headed in one di rection ~ toward total socialism. The drift was slow at first, to be sure, but the mo mentum steadily gathered and I know of no politician who ever altered its course in the slightest. Today, we are in the final stages and no politician is going to stop it ~ beca use politics will always come first by the very nature of politics. There is only one answer for the frustrated individ ual who recognizes the futility of politics: get out of the political arena and start investigating ways to protect your own life and property before it is too late.

The billions of dollars being spent to save the world f rom communism make this war on a par with the other two great wars ~ the one that ma de the world safe for democracy and the one that saved the world from fascism. However, the method of fighting this war is peculia rly different from the other two. Perhaps if our “statesmen” of the first two world w ars had possessed the military insight of our present leaders, the two previous wa rs would have been won much faster. Let’s picture a 1943 meeting of the President’s cab inet, called to discuss the waging of the second world war ~ but with the new techniqu es our statesmen have since learned. The President opens the meeting with: “First, befor e we discuss anything else, I want to congratulate the Secretary of State for his stro ke of genius in our Italian policy. Who but a genius would have thought of sending fore ign aid to Mussolini to ‘wean’ him away from Hitler “And the idea of bringing their pilots here to Texa s to train them in the American airplanes we’re giving them ~ why, that just takes your breath away!” “Thank you, Mr. President,” the Secretary replies. “And I’m sure that after we’ve given Mr. Mussolini enough money, he’ll realize our good intentions and quit shooting down our fliers with our own equipment.” “Of course. And now,” the President continues, “We must discuss our Japanese policy. Our Japanese expert, Sujo Pewajo, has just returned from a fact-finding trip to the Far East. He recommends that we drop our suppor t of the British and Chinese and throw in with Premier Tojo’s regime.” “But, Mr. President,” the Postmaster General compla ins, “Premier Tojo is the military leader of the Japanese government. He’s signed a pa ct with Hitler, who is our enemy in this war.” “Nonsense, Jim,” the President overrules, “my advis or has assured me that Mr. Tojo is simply an ‘agrarian reformer.’ And his philosophy i s the wave of the future.” "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 106 “Mr. President,” the Ambassador to Germany interjec ts, “Don’t forget that next Tuesday is the anniversary of Mr. Hitler’s appointm ent as Chancellor. You must be sure to send him congratulations and the usual stat ement about our mutual search for peace.” “Oh yes, thank you, Mr. Ambassador. I think we’ll s kip today our usual endless argument about whether our troops should cross the English Channel. For we need some bold new idea right now; the whole course of t he war has been pretty lethargic. Who has a suggestion?” It is the Attorney General who raises the idea that has since become a classic textbook example in the successful waging of a war. “Mr. Pre sident,” he says, “I think you should invite Mr. Hitler to an exchange of visits. You go to Germany (we’ll suspend bombing and spying missions while you do, of course ) and Mr. Hitler comes to America so he can see what democracy is really like .” “Sheer genius!” the President shouts. “I’ve never h eard anything like it. Why we’ll take him to Valley Forge, the Iowa corn belt, Indep endence Hall, the Capitol Building and . . .” But the Attorney General interrupts: “Well, I’ve al ready sounded him out on those places, Mr. President, but he’s not interested. How ever, he will come on one condition.” “What’s that?” “Mr. Hitler wants to go to Disneyland.”  "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 107 A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER By Harry Browne The American Way, Vol. 5, No. 51 December 20, 1966 To my 9-year-old daughter: It’s Christmas and I have the typical problem of tr ying to know what to give to you. I know there are many things you might enjoy ~ games, books, clothes. But I’m very selfish. I want to give you something that will last more than a few weeks or months in your mind. In fact, I want to gi ve you a gift that will perhaps lead you to think of me on every Christmas to come in yo ur life. I have finally realized that if there were only one thing I could give you, I would want it to be a simple truth that took me many years to learn. If you can understand it now, it may enrich your life in hundreds of ways. And it may prevent hundreds of problems that have hurt people who have never learned it. The truth is simply this: No one owes you anything. Now, how could such a simple statement have any gre at importance? And yet, the deep meaning behind it can bring you a thousand ble ssings. It means that no one else is living for you, my chi ld. Because no one is you. Each person is living for himself; his own happiness is all he can ever personally feel. When you realize that it is no one’s duty to make y ou happy or give you what you want, you will be freed from the chains of expectin g what can never be. It means that no one has to love you. If your mother loves you, it’s becaus e there is something special about you that gives her happiness. Find out what that somet hing special is and try to make it stronger in you, so t hat she’ll love you even more. She doesn’t have to fix meals: she wants to. Aren’t you proud to know that? If you want her to continue to do so, make sure you’re the kind of person that will always inspire her to want to do things for you. And remem ber that this is an exchange between you ~ each of you is giving happiness to th e other. Neither of you owes anything to the other. No one has to like you. If your friends want to be with you, it is not because it is their duty to be with you. Find out what makes others hap py so they’ll want to be near you."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 108 And no one has to respect you. Some people will eve n try to be unkind to you. But once you realize that people do not have to be good to you, and may not be good to you, you’ll learn to avoid those who would harm you . For you do not owe them anything either. No one owes you anything. You owe it to yourself to be the best person possib le. Because if you are, others will want to be with you, want to provide you with the things you want in exchang e for what you are giving to them. Some people will choose not to associate with you f or reasons that have nothing to do with you. When you know that this is true in a give n case, look elsewhere for the relationships you want. Don’t make someone else’s p roblem your problem. Once you learn that you must earn the love and respect of others, you will never expect the impossible and so you will never be disa ppointed. Others do not have to share their property with you nor their feelings no r their thoughts. If they do, it is because you have earned these thi ngs. And you have every reason to be proud of your mother’s love, your friends’ respe ct, the property you have earned. But don’t ever take them for granted. If you do, yo u’ll lose them. They’re not yours by right: you must always earn them. It is not easy to sum up in a few words what has ta ken me years to learn. But maybe if you reread this gift each Christmas, the meaning wi ll become a little clearer each year.

You are not the person you “ought” to be ~ or the p erson others want you to be ~ or the person you hope someday to be. You are what you are right now. Your present decisions should be based upon yoursel f as you are. This does not mean that you will not work to improve yourself. Natural ly, there are many areas of yourself you would like to see strengthened. But you should not act as if that self-improvement has already taken place. This means you should recognize your limitations . Your physical limitations are obvious. You do not buy clothes that are made for s omeone a foot taller than you; and you do not assume that you can run a mile in four m inutes just because there are human beings who can. But there are mental limitations, too. And it is no t my purpose to suggest that you are bound forever to these limitations. Only that your present decisions should be based upon your present status. Do arguments make you depressed or unnerved? Then r ecognize this about yourself and base your conduct on that fact of life. Don’t s ay to yourself, “I ought to be able to engage in arguments without becoming unnerved or lo sing my temper.” Recognize yourself as you are and take steps to assure that y ou don’t get into arguments in the first place ~ instead of hoping that you’ll suddenl y become a different person next time you’re in one. In the same way, recognize that you will make mista kes in life. Do not expect that tomorrow will be the first day of a new mistake-fre e life. You have made mistakes, you are making them, and you will continue to make them. So base your life on this recognition and arrange your affairs in such a way that you can afford the mistakes that you will inevitably make. Don’t allow yourself to become vulnerable to more t han you can handle by expecting yourself never to make an error. You carry insuranc e on your car because you recognize the fact that you could make a mistake and cause an accident. You do not want to be vulnerable to costs you can not stand. Y ou don’t take the attitude that if you drive carefully, you will never have an acciden t.

Life is a combination of the positive and the negative. Both exist. They can not be wished away. The intelligent person does not assume that h e will never do anything wrong. Rather, he arranges things so that his mistakes (wh ich will inevitably happen) will not cost him too dearly. Work to improve yourself in every meaningful way. L earn how to be the person you want to be ~ the one who is capable of obtaining wh at you want from life. But, while you’re learning, recognize yourself as y ou are. Take an inventory of both your strengths and weaknesses. This will not hurt y our confidence in any way. It will enhance your confidence ~ because you will no longe r be trying to hide yourself from yourself.

Although this is true in all areas of one’s life, perhaps it can best be ill ustrated by a financial example. A few years back, a friend of mine bought stock for $80 per share or $8,000 total. After a few months, the stock had dropped to $60 pe r share. When I asked him what he was going to do about it, he said he would now just have to wait until Douglas went back up to $80. Then he wou ld sell his stock and buy one that would be more profitable. But as long as Douglas wa s selling at under $80, he could not get out of it without taking a loss. Now, what was wrong with this approach? He was pre-occupied with his prior investment. His attitude (like the attitude of many individuals in many problems) was that he did not w ant to lose $2,000 in the stock market. But the fact of the matter was that he had already lost $2,000. That was over and done with ~ because he only had $6,000 worth of stock now ~ instead of the $8,000 he originally invested. The loss was over; it was part of history ~ irrever sible. There was nothing he could do to change it. Now, with $6,000 at his disposal, he must ask himse lf how he can increase it in the fastest way ~ since he was a speculator. If he beli eved that Douglas was the fastest- rising stock, he should leave it with Douglas. But, obviously, he did not feel this way. So he sho uld have put his $6,000 into another stock, accepting his loss on Douglas, and working t o make $2,000 or more profit on something else. The decisions to be made at this point is not “How do I make sure that I have no net loss on Douglas stock?” It is “Now that I have $6,0 00, what choice can I make that will increase that as fast as possible? It hurts to have to admit that you put too much of your precious time or money into some poor investment of the past. But the sooner yo u accept the mistake as part of history, the sooner will you be able to move forwar d toward greater happiness in the future."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 112 For instance, a man might say “I have 12 years inve sted in this marriage; I might as well stick it out now.” But the 12 years are meanin gless. What is important is: “What do I have to show for the 12 years?” Perhaps he has a rapport and understanding with his wife that he feels would take 12 years or more to develop with some other woman. If that is so, he might decide that 12 years of the future is too long to invest to bring himself back to where he is right now. But if he co uld develop a similar rapport with a new spouse in 12 days, his respect for the past 12 years is only preventing him from doing what is obviously more profitable. When you are ready to sell something, you want to k now only what is the highest price you can obtain in the market place. Your prev ious cost are unimportant. If you bought something for $500 and now find that the mos t you can get for it is $100, there is no point in turning down this best offer (unless you think keeping the object would be worth more than $100 to you). Why say “I’d be crazy to sell for $100, something I paid $500 for”? If you do, what you’re really saying is: “I was crazy to pay $500 f or something I can only sell for $100.” Take your eyes off the past. For it is over and don e with. Learn from it. But don’t try to erase the mistakes of the past by deciding you must get back every investment you have put into it. Once you know an investment of ti me, energy or knowledge was wrong, accept it ~ and then decide where you go fro m here. And you want to go up ~ not back!

Today’s question: Ronald Reagan, the Republican can didate for president, is running on a platform that includes: an end to foreign aid; an end to farm subsidies and controls; placing Social Security and Medicare on a voluntary, self-supporting, private enterprise basis; selling TVA to private enterprise ; and repealing all legislation granting privileges to labor unions. How do you fee l about this campaign? Wilford Spatz, 54, manufacturer: “Well, I think the man is just great. I mean, here’s a guy who’s not afraid to stand up and call socialism socialism. I say ‘more power to him.’ I would vote for him myself if it were not fo r his unrealistic attitude on foreign aid. After all, most foreign aid money is spent rig ht here in the good old U.S.A., helping our economy. I know ~ because my company ha ndles several of these foreign aid contracts for the government.” Mildred Volker, 68, retired housewife: “Isn’t that man just wonderful? At last, someone has the guts to get the farmers and the man ufacturers and the labor leaders and all the rest of the freeloaders off the dole. O f course, I can’t vote for him.

Your Future Is In Your Hands “All right ~ I agree. If I become more valuable to my employer, he’ll want to pay me more. But What specifically can I do to be more valuable?” First of all, take a few minutes to look at your jo b. What is the purpose of it? Why does someone pay you to perform that job? What does it accomplish? Then, think some more. What could you do to accomplish that objective in less time or at less expense? How could you make it possible for more value to be produced in the same amount of time? It doesn’t necessarily involve working faster ~ although that’s one possible way. But you don’t want to work so fast that the quality of your work suffers. Perhaps there is some way the work could be rearran ged to be more productive. Or maybe there’s a simple tool available that would in crease your speed or efficiency. Discuss with your supervisor any ideas you develop. Don’t be discouraged if he points out some negative factor you hadn’t thought of; jus t go “back to the drawing board” and think some more. And don’t fear that your supervisor will “take all the credit”. Part of his value to the company is his ability to recognize talented people and tell management about them. Besides, even if you don’t get credit for the first idea, the mind that conceived of it can think of others;; and you’ll know better how to handle it next time. Widen your view. Look at your whole department. Is there some way it could be reorganized for greater efficiency? Check your qualifications for your present job. Doe s it utilize many of the skills and talents you possess? If not , there may be a higher-paying job in your company you can handle. Or there may be another job you think you’d like, b ut you don’t have all the skills necessary. Find out how you can acquire the needed knowledge ~ and then make the investment of time or money.

Your future is not dependent upon “luck”. It depends upon your willingness to increase your value to others. As you become more valuable, people will bid higher for your services ~ because it will be profitable for them to do so!

It’s too bad ~ because realistic self-improvement i s the road to getting more of the good things from life.

At the age of 14, just 7 years out of slavery, he w anted to attend the Hampton Institute in Virginia. His most important goal was to get an education. He “hitchhiked” 500 miles to get to the Institute. When he arrived there, he was able to make a deal with the school officials to work hi s way through school. Part of the arrangement was that he would work as a janitor in exchange for part of his board bill. The rest was to be paid in cash. What could he do? What would you do in such a situation? In his autobiography, he gives the answer ~ and sho ws the important key to success: “I was determined from the first to make my work as janitor so valuable that my services would be indispensable. This I succeeded i n doing to such an extent that I was soon informed that I would be allowed the full cost of my board in return for my work.” He was determined to be so valuable that his servic es would be indispensable. And there is the secret of success! People will pay you in accordance with the value they see in you ~ and if you provide a unique value, you become indispensable.

Every previous nation had been plagued with the curse of too much government . No one tried very hard to improve himself or produce enoug h food or other necessities ~ because everyone knew the government would take mos t of what was produced. America introduced a new era.

Your Future Is In Your Hands Does your employer “exploit” you? If you’ve ever been tempted to think he does, possi bly you haven’t noticed how similar his situation is to yours. Let’s identify your relationship to him. When a con sumer pays for a product, he gives money to a human being for something he wants more than the money. The retailer who receives it from him has performed a service. He has made the product available at a time and place of the consum er’s choosing. The retailer will then pay employees ~ because he f eels he could not receive the money without their help. He also pays part of it to a wholesaler who helps h im by having a ready supply of the product available for him. And part of the money goes to the maker of the prod uct. He, in turn, gives part of what he receives to employees. Again, he does this because he believes he could not receive the money without their help. And he will also pay for the cost of “materials” ~ the wood or other resources from which the product was made. Here again, the price i s paid to human beings ~ for their services in bringing the materials out of the groun d. Even rent is a price paid for a human service ~ the privilege of using the landlord’s property. And monetary profits are paid to investors for the use of money they have earned and saved ~ only because that “capital” is needed to pr oduce the product. Then there’s the “entrepreneur” ~ the man who organ ized the company. He is paid for his ability to figure out what consumers want, how they want it, and how much they’ll pay for it. Without that talent, products would be produced that no one would buy. So every part of the price the consumer pays will e ventually go to human being for the services they perform. Every price is a price for human services ~ just li ke yours!"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 123 And the only reason anyone receives any part of that price is because the pro duct cannot get to the consumer and be sold without his service. If anyone decides his service is worth more than others are willing to pay him, the others will find a way to get things done without h im. Each person in the whole process has a service to p erform. But each is required to provide something of value to the others. For if he doesn’t, he will be replaced. This applies to the retailer, the wholesaler, the m anufacturer, the landlord, the investor, the boss and to you! You are not exploited. Neither is anyone else who h as voluntarily chosen his own job. But everyone must provide a valuable service to oth ers or he will not be needed.

Your Future Is In Your Hands What are “fringe losses”? They say that “fringe benefits” are extra benefits you get in addition to your regular pay. So “fringe losses” must be dollars taken away from your pay. Unfortunately, you have some fringe losses in your job. The federal government requires your employer to ta ke money meant for you and use it for the government’s old-age and medical insuran ce plans, and for the income tax. And most state governments require the employer to set aside other dollars for disability insurance, unemployment insurance and ot her uses. It doesn’t matter whether you think these are good or bad investments. Your employer is forced to buy these items for you. They are “fringe losse s” ~ they come out of the money your employer would otherwise be paying to yo u. In most states, these “fringe losses” amount to ove r 25% of what your employer would pay for your services. On top of this, many employers offer what they call “fringe benefits”. But these, too, must come out of the money the employer is willing to pay to obtain the value of the employee’s services. If there were no fringe benefits, the employee woul d receive the money in cash and spend it on whatever he wanted. So a “fringe benefit” simply means the employer is deciding in advance what the employee should spend his money for. It takes away from what the employee would be able to spend; it doesn’t add. So they are not “fringe benefits” ~ they are “fring e losses”! Your employer believes you have the ability to think fo r yourself. If he didn’t, he wouldn’t believe you can profit from reading these messages. He knows that what you decide for yourself will be your best course of act ion.

And that means more of the good things you want in life. We’re talking about waste ~ one of the biggest problems facing any business. Waste simply means money that is spent to buy supplies an d materials that are never used ~ that wind up in the trash can. And because waste is such an important problem to every company, your employer will welcome any efforts to cut down on waste. And you employer will be quite willing to reward anyone who can provide positive, specific savings. Because waste is such a large and critical problem, it is an excellent area in which to demonstrate your value to the company ~ and in turn make more for yourself. Here are some ideas to get you started: 1. Cultivate a respect for property. Everything you se e has cost someone time and effort. When you waste property, you are wasting th e time and effort of the person who purchased it. 2. As you order new materials, take an extra minute to check your needs and be sure you’re not asking for something you won’t eventuall y use. 3. Check the waste problems of your department and you r company. See if you can devise a system that will make it in the self-inter est of each individual to avoid waste.

Are you paid too much? Not enough? Just the right w age? How can you tell how much you’re worth? Actually, i t’s very easy to tell. Let’s examine the simple formula by which wages are estab lished ~ and see how you can increase them: First of all, we know that everyone uses his money in ways he considers most important. The buyer looks at a product, mentally s ets a value on it, and then decides whether or not the product is as valuable as the pr ice being asked for it. Your employer offers products and services to poten tial buyers. He sets a price. Then the buyer judges whether or not it’s a “fair” price by whether or not he buys. If your employer finds it difficult to make sales, he must either lower the price, increase the value of the product, or else go into another line of business. Since your employer can’t make these products by hi mself, he hires you and others to help him. He has to pay you a wage that’s consistent with the price he can sell the product for. So here’s how it’s determined if you’re getting the right wage: If your wage is too low, someone else will be willi ng to hire you at a higher wage. That other employer will recognize that your value to him is greater than the wage you’re getting, and offer you more to work for him. If your wage is too high, you’ll eventually lose yo ur job ~ either because your employer will find someone else who will work for l ess ~ or because your employer will not be able to sell his product at a profit, a nd will go out of business. Even if your employer were forced to pay a higher wage, this would just hasten the day when you’ll be out of a job. He’ll pay the highest wage possible, because this i s the only way he can obtain the employees whose value will help him make a profit.

Let’s get a clear look by taking a journey. Suppose you were stranded on a desert island ~ all by yourself. Since there would be no o ne else to exchange with, many facts of life would be clear. Obviously, you could only have what you were willin g to produce. And you would only bother producing those things you really wante d . It would be no satisfaction to spend 24 hours producing something you didn’t reall y want. This becomes more important as someone else joins y ou on the island.

He is not interested in the time and effort you hav e expended. He is more interested in the value to him ~ in terms of his desires. The same principle applies here in an economy of mi llions of individuals ~ each specializing in a particular job. No one really car es about the time and energy you put into a job; each potential buyer of your service is only interested in the value to him. And how is that value measured? The buyer has limit ed resources at his disposal. He can trade for the things that he wants the most. Bu t he can only trade what he has, no more. Therefore, he must choose between all the alt ernatives available to him. And he’ll choose on the basis of his desires. “Costs” to the seller are unimportant to the buyer. He may be quite willing to pay a lot mor e for something that took only two hours to make than for something that took ten hour s.

Your Future Is In Your Hands Your job could be lost through no fault of your own . In the last folder, we reviewed the simple formula by which you can tell if you’re being paid the proper wage: If your wage is too low, some other employer will o ffer you more ~ in order to profit from your services. If your wage is too high, you’ll eventually lose yo ur job ~ either because someone else will work for less, or because the buyer will be un willing to pay the price of the product you produce. If your employer is profiting from your services, a nd if no one else is offering you more for them, you’re getting the proper wage. To l ower that wage (without lowering your value) will make it attractive to someone else to hire you. To raise it (without increasing your value) will create the conditions b y which you can lose your job. Strangely there are people who would force an artif icially-high wage on you. These people think wages can be raised through pres sure ~ by passing laws or by “strikes”. But just suppose this method is successful. Your wa ge is raised ~ but now it’s no longer profitable to your employer to keep you on t he payroll. He can’t raise his prices ~ because his buyers will choose to spend their mon ey on other things of greater value to them. Suppose, for instance, that a man is paid $1.25 per hour. No other employer is offering him more. Then the government decides ther e will be a minimum wage of $1.50 per hour. At this point, the employer decides that the employ ee who is profitable to him at $1.25, is not profitable at $1.50. So he has to let the employee go. Has the employee been helped by the “minimum wage”? Of course not. Because the minimum no longer applies to him. He doesn’t even h ave a job anymore!

Your employer’s role in business is to sell your se rvice to his customers. Every job in your company is designed to efficientl y provide a product or service to your company’s customers. If the customer doesn’t b uy, there’s no income. This means there are no wages to pay, no profits to divi de, no money to reinvest in new equipment.

Even today, there are many pla ces in the world where few people live past 30 years of age. Why are we so much better off? After all, America has no more natural resources than many other nations. An understanding of the difference provides the key to raising your standard of living! There are only two ways to organize a society: one is with freedom , the other with coercion (force). When a society is organized by coercion , the government makes economic decisions and imposes these upon everyone by force. It makes no difference whether that government is elected by the people or is a dictato rship. In the coercive society, the government decides wha t will be produced, in what quantity, what it will cost, and how much its citiz ens will have to spend. It then tries to subsidize the citizens who suffer for the govern ment’s mistakes. The symbol of all such societies is the Soviet Unio n today ~ where no one but a government official has more than just enough to ba rely stay alive. What about the free economy ? America had a nearly-free economy when the nation was founded. The result? Today we Americans (with 6 % of the world’s population) have produced half of the world’s good things. This is what freedom brings. Why does it work so well? Because each individual w orks at the job where he can produce the most satisfaction for other people (thi s is the job that will pay him the most). And because each individual can spend his earnings on what he wants the most, businessmen automatically produce what will satisfy this demand. So, we all have more of the things we really want.

Prosperity comes from people being able to choose f or themselves how they want to spend the money they earn. When individuals can cho ose, businesses must provide what people really want in order to survive. When government taxes and spends your money for you , you lose the freedom to choose how to spend your earnings. And no one has t o be pleased to keep the government-run businesses going. “ Why can’t I make ends meet?” Because so much of your buying power is taken from you by taxes!

Your Future Is In Your Hands Are you getting dividends or interest on your capit al? “Hold it!” you say. “I don’t have any capital. I do n’t own any stocks or bonds. And my small savings account doesn’t earn enough intere st to keep me supplied in toothpicks. So why talk about capital to me? Because you do have capital. And that capital is probably lying i dle right now ~ when it could be earning income for you, adding to what you earn in wages. Let’s find that capital and use it to make money fo r you. First of all, what is capital? Capital is a form of savings ~ something you own th at others value. Capital can be used to make things that people will pay to have. For example, money can be capital. One man earns interest on his mone y by lending it to others. But, obviously, no one will pay you inte rest if you bury your money in the back yard. In the same way, tools are capital. If you own a set of tools, you can re nt them, or you can make things that people will pay for. But, agai n tools produce no return sitting idle in the garage. But there is another form of capital: talent . If you possess a talent for doing something, it can make money for you ~ if you use it . And I’ll bet you have several talents inside you that you’ve never thought of us ing on the job. If so, they could be making money for you. The skills and ideas you use in other areas of your life are all potential moneymakers for you at work. These talents can be used to incre ase your value to the company. And that will increase what the company pays you for your s ervices. These talents are your capital. Here’s a good example: the way you organize your ho usehold ~ your ability to make repairs, take care of equipment, plan for the futur e, create an economical plan, purchase wisely, stop waste. All of these are skill s you have developed with"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 173 experience. They are an investment you’ve made. If you use them as sincerely on the job, your value will go up ~ and that means your in come will go up. But there’s more: the understanding you bring to th e problems of friends; the warmth and genuine interest you offer to someone you’d lik e to know better. These, too, are talents that represent capital. Take the same genui ne interest in the problems of your company, and your value will go up! Why let your capital sit idle when it could be earning interest for you? Take a few minutes this evening to look at your “talent accoun t” and make a list of those you haven’t been using on the job. Then make it a point to use them ~ and see the dividends they bring.

Your Future Is In Your Hands Any schoolboy can tell you that the Thanksgiving ce lebration is derived from the first Pilgrim feast of thanks. Forgotten, however, are the reasons why the Pilgrims first starved and then prospered. According to Governor Bradford’s own log, the first thing they did upon arriving at Plymouth Rock was “to erect ye first house for comm on use to receive them and their goods.” The “common house” kept all the food and production . All property belonged to the people “in common”. In other words, the Pilgrims we re practicing the communist idea: “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” But within three months, half of the Pilgrims had a lready perished. And after two years of starvation and misery, Governor Bradford s ummoned the leaders of the colony to a meeting. After much soul-searching, the y decided to adopt the seemingly heartless policy of letting each man fend for himse lf. Henceforth, each family would own its own parcel of land ~ and no one would be responsible for anyone else. Private property had arrived at Plymouth Rock. Bradford states: “This had very good success; for i t made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn was planted then otherwise wou ld have been . . . “The women now went willingly into ye field, and to ok their little-ones with them to set corn, which before would allege weakness and in ability.” Now no one had to resent working for others. Each p roduced to the limit of his ambition and ability ~ because what he produced was his! This is perhaps history’s most dramatic contrast be tween private property and communism. The Pilgrims found that it was not the a dversities of nature that caused their misery. Their problems stemmed from taking aw ay from a man what he has produced. When the Pilgrims discovered the secret of private property, it’s no wonder they held a Thanksgiving feast to celebrate the rewards of th eir discovery. "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Freedom The American Way/Harry Browne 175 Today, we are rapidly moving toward a condition of common ownership ~ similar to that practiced first by the Pilgrims. Taxes take ov er 30% of the earnings of each of us. Small wonder that incentive and ambition are decrea sing. Let us look forward to the day of Thanksgiving when you can celebrate the opportunity to keep what you earn . WHY IT WON’T WORK “From each according to his ability, to each accord ing to his need” can never work. For each will attempt to be less able and more needy . And who will produce the wealth to be divided?
