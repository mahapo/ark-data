Recognizing the disastrous monet ary policy of the U.S. government, he warned that the dollar would be devalued, inflation could be severe, and gold, silver, and fo reign currencies should skyrocket in value. The book's theme clashed with the prevailing wisdom, but it struck a chord with tens of thousand s of Americans, and the book made the New York Times bestseller list. The first few chapters of the devaluation book are the clearest and most extensive explanation of how the government money s ystem works and perverts the free market. Equally important, it’s w ritten in language that any reasonably intelligent layman can understand. Fortunately, prior to Harry’s death in 2006, he edi ted the following chapters in preparation for publication: The Role of Money, What is Money?, What is Paper?, What is Inflation?, The Gov ernment and Money, How To Create Money, Mass Confusion, Inflati on Starts to Gallop, and Who Will Protect You? In addition to the aforementioned chapters, this bo ok includes a brief afterword that directs you to another short book by Harry Browne that can help you get started creating a bulletproof por tfolio you can walk away from ~ while protecting you from inflation, de flation, or recession, while allowing you to profit from prospe rous periods. I sincerely hope you’ll benefit from this book.

Everything flows from the way the money system is handled. It is the cause of inflation, of depressions, of any sudden changes in the economy. Not one person in a thousand really understands wha t money is. And yet, there are few subjects in the world more f ascinating than the study of money. A proper grasp of it will give you the key that unlocks the many puzzles of national economic events. Witho ut that understanding, it’s impossible to think for oneself ; instead, you’re forced to rely upon the superficial conclusions of people with conflicting opinions and credentials. This book covers 99% of all you need to know about money and its effect upon the economy. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 9 1 What Is Money? Where do we begin? Let’s go back to the very basics, so there can be n o misunderstanding between us as we proceed to the co nclusions. If you were to find yourself alone on an isolated i sland, you’d have no need for a medium of exchange. There would be no one with whom to exchange. You would go to work, as necessary, to produce the things you needed for your survival. You’d produce some things that you would want to consume immediately, and you would probably produce other things to be stored for later use. You might also produce some other things that would be called “capital goods” — things that make further producti on easier. But you would only produce when you believed it would lead ultimately to something you wanted. Not hard to understand, is it? Let’s suppose now that there was one other person o n the island with you. Each of you has his own area of the islan d and each of you is producing for himself. Sooner or later, you’d probably begin exchanging th ings with each other. Perhaps you’ve produced more than you n eed of something he hasn’t produced, and vice versa. You’d exchange your surplus with each other — and both of you would profit thereby. Obviously, you won’t trade your production for some thing you have no use for. Why bother working if your efforts don’t eventually"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 10 bring you something you can use? You’ll trade only for those things you want to use now or can store for use at a later date. And here we have a very important rule at work, one that we should file mentally for reference later on: You produce or exchange only when you believe it will lead ultimately to so mething you want. On such a simple basis, with only one or two people involved it’s very easy to see and understand what’s happeni ng. You’re producing and exchanging in order to acquire the th ings you’ll eventually use to further your own well-being. But now let’s suppose there are 100 people on the i sland — each with his own area. You will still have to produce t o survive; there’s no way to avoid that. But exchanges will probably take place on a much wi der basis. In fact, it will be only a matter of time until a “ specialization of labor” develops. That’s where an individual no longer prod uces everything for himself. Instead, he concentrates on the production of only one or two items — and then trades his production with others for the products and services he wants. You know that no one’s going to exchange with you i f you don’t have something he wants. So you’ll gear your produc tion to those things that are in demand by others. In that way, y ou’ll get the most possible in return. These trades with others are called direct exchange — the trading of some of your property for another commod ity you intend to use yourself. This is also called barter — trading without money. The direct exchanges are a natural step in the deve lopment of a civilized society. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 11 INDIRECT EXCHANGE But, eventually, you find yourself in a position wh ere you’re willing to accept in exchange an item you don’t int end to use. You accept it only to improve your trading position wit h someone else. Suppose you have butter and you’re looking for whea t. I have wheat, but I’m not looking for butter. Instead, I need corn. So you g o find a third person who has corn and is looking for butter. You trade your butter for his corn. Then you come back to me and trade the corn for my wheat. You have what you want; but it took two exchanges t o get it. This is the beginning of indirect exchange — the trading of one thing for something you don’t intend to use yourself. For example, one day Jones the nail-maker walks int o the store of Smith the furniture-maker (whose store is conven iently located under a palm tree). Jones opens the conversation with, “S mith, I need a new workbench. I’ll give you 2,000 nails to make one fo r me.” “Sorry,” said Smith, “I have all the nails I’ll ne ed for awhile. Those you gave me for the bed I made for you will last me for another six months. Come back and see me then.” Determined not to be refused, Jones goes on, “But I need the workbench now ! Look, you’re bound to use those nails eventually. But, even in the meantime, you can probably trade them t o someone else for something you need. I’m always getting offers of tr ades from people wanting nails. They’re a lot easier to exchange tha n furniture.” “You have a point there,” ponders Smith. “I do seem to have a lot of trouble exchanging king-size beds for clothe s. This way, I’d use only as many nails as I need for each purchase . . . well, okay — I’ll try anything once.” So he accepts the nails and makes the workbench for Jones. And then he goes out to find products for which he can exchange the nails."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 12 And, lo and behold, it works! He finds that trades are much easier to make. As a result, he enjoys life a lot m ore with a few nails in his pocket. He can stop at a store and trade for an ything he wants to — without having to exchange a king-size bed for a pe anut-butter sandwich. In fact, he merely points out to the merchant the a dvantages of nails as a trading medium in the same way that Jone s pointed them out to him. And the final argument is that you can alwa ys use the nails sometime in the future; they won’t lose their value. And if you don’t use them, someone will. The merchant realizes this; and so be accepts the n ails, confident that he can use them or trade them for what he want s. In the months to follow, Jones the nail-maker notic es a slow, steady increase in the demand for his product. Why? Because individuals, one at a time , are coming to see that it’s valuable to have a few extra nails on hand (in addition to those neede d for construction purposes) to facilitate exchanges with others. Nails seem to most people on the island to be an id eal trading medium. But once there are enough nails around for that purpose, the demand will level off. The nails are not free; they cost Jones his time to make them and he demands something in return when h e trades them with others. So no one’s going to pay for more nail s than he’ll find useful to have. As a result, once there are enough nails in circula tion to facilitate exchange, there’ll be no additional valu e from more nails. In other words, like any other commodity, they seek th eir natural level of quantity, their market price. Let’s go back a moment to the point we recognized o n page ten: You produce or exchange only when you believe it wi ll lead ultimately to something you want. Smith, the furniture-maker, didn’t produce the work bench just for the sake of producing. In his eyes, his profit didn’t come from the number of beds or workbenches produced."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 13 Neither did his satisfaction come from the number h e sold. To be able to say he sold a certain number of pieces o f furniture was of no particular value to him. To Smith, the object of it all was to obtain the th ings he wanted. He produced and sold furniture with only one purpos e in mind — to trade it for the specific things he wanted. So he wouldn’t make a workbench just to be making a workbench. Nor would he accept nails just so he could say he’d made a sale. He agreed to Jones’s offer only when he was convinc ed it was a step toward getting what he wanted. And this is a vital point. Neither production volum e nor sales volume is ever the object. It’s only what you event ually receive for it that counts. You only produce and exchange when you believe it will lead ultimately to something you want. We will have occasion to come back to this seemingl y obvious point as we proceed. But, meanwhile, we see that th is simple little trade has been the seed from which exchange is born on th e island. And as it naturally grows in use and acceptance, it opens up all kinds of new possibilities for residents of the com munity. Now it’s possible for one man to employ another, paying him with nails instead of with fractions of a house. Now long-term capital investments can be made by trading one’s production for nails, purchas ing capital goods with the nails, making a new product, and finally s elling it. So nails have become money. And what is money? Money is a commodity that is accepted in exchange b y an individual who intends to trade it for something el se. Money is a commodity, just like everything else tha t’s traded in the marketplace. What distinguishes a money commodi ty from other commodities is the intention of the recipient to ke ep it only until he trades it to someone else. It’s only a means to a f urther exchange for that recipient. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 14 Not everyone intends to trade it, however. Some people receive the money commodity, intending to use it for its ow n natural purpose (in this case, nails for construction purposes). And this brings us to the key word in the definitio n of money: accepted . The commodity can become money only when an indiv idual accepts it — when someone’s willing to take it, confident that he can trade it ultimately for what he wants. You only produce and exchange when you believe it’l l lead ultimately to something you want. So you won’t acce pt bamboo reeds — just because someone wants something you have. The commodity to be used as money must already have established itself as being in demand — otherwise, you’d never be sure that you could trade it later for something you wan ted. Because of this, the money commodity is never chose n by a majority vote; it’s never initially imposed upon a community by the government; it’s never collectively nor arbitrarily selected. It evolves — one exchange at a time — as one individual and then another decide to accept it in exchange. Governments can only choose to go along with what h as naturally evolved in the marketplace. If they stray from that, they’re doomed to destruction. For money only takes on valu e as individuals are willing to accept it. But we’ll come back to go vernments later. To summarize, the money commodity will emerge, one exchange at a time, as each individual sees the com modity, evaluates it, and agrees to accept it — believing this will furth er his ability to obtain eventually the items he wants. In our island example, the individual accepted the nails because he knew how much they were worth in terms of other commodities; and he knew that, come what may, they’d always be of so me value to him. He knew he’d never be “stuck” with nails (pardon th e pun) because he could also use them himself. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 15 As we’ve seen, the volume of nails would be determi ned by the number of nails that proved useful in exchange, tog ether with the normal demand for nails in construction. Beyond tha t, any additional production of nails by Jones would be worthless to him; more nails would simply lessen the exchange value of each nail . So he’d be working harder (producing more nails) but getting n o more in return. If he tried to demand more for his nails than indiv iduals were willing to give (the market value), he’d be invitin g competition. For someone else could then offer nails at a lower exch ange price; or possibly even offer a more useful commodity as a me dium of exchange. So Jones’s success will still depend upon his techn ical ability and marketing sense; he has no special advantage ju st because he’s the man who produces the money commodity. WHY GOLD AND SILVER? It’s quite possible that more than one commodity mi ght be used as money — either in the same or in neighboring com munities. The only question that matters is: will an individual b e willing to accept the commodity in an exchange? But it is only natural that consumers will begin to rely upon the one or two commodities that best satisfy their need s and desires in exchanges. Despite the hundreds of different commod ities that have been used as money at various times and places in h istory, two commodities have dominated the money markets for ce nturies. They are gold and silver . But why gold and silver? As we’ve seen, the development would have had to be purely natural — one exchange at a time — adding up to bil lions of trades. No one person or group ever decided that it would be s o. But, in retrospect, we can look back and understand why gold and silver become supreme. There are five main attributes of gold and silver t hat give individuals good reason to accept these commodities confidently:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 16 1. Both commodities are durable . They can be stored for long periods of time, if necessary, without perishing. O bviously, bananas won’t do. Imagine saving up for a new car, then goi ng to the closet to take out your savings, only to find they were rotte n. 2. The commodities are easily divisible . As we saw, it was easier to exchange nails than furniture because you could divide a supply of nails into small purchases. And gold and silver can be broken into smaller pieces or used as dust — without harming th eir inherent value in any way. 3. Gold and silver are relatively convenient to handle. Their naturally high market values make it possible to wo rk with small quantities. Paper wouldn’t do — because you’d need so much of it to be worth a desired item that it would be inconvenient to carry and exchange. 4. Gold and silver are each consistent in quality. Once it has been assayed and its fineness determined, one ounce of gold is as good as any other ounce of the same fineness. This simpl ifies exchange negotiations. For short periods in history, each of these four ru les has been violated by various commodities that still managed to serve adequately as money. But for a commodity to suffice as money, a fifth attribute is absolutely necessary. For we’re talking about human beings whose futures and securities are at stake. And they won’t produce and exchange unless they believe it will lead ultimatel y to something useful. This means the individual must be confident that wh at he is receiving today will be exchangeable tomorrow. And how can he be sure of that? 5. The commodity must have accepted value . It must be usable and already accepted for a non-money purpose before it can serve as money. Only then can the recipient be sure he isn’t receiving a white elephant. Gold is a commodity — just like lettuce, nails, bri cks, or toothpaste. Gold has its own uses. In fact, gold an d silver are used for"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 17 such things as jewelry, dental work, electronics, a rt objects, ornamentation, soldering, photography, and other pu rposes. If gold weren’t money, it would still circulate in the worl d because of its other uses. (We normally refer to the non-money uses as commercial or industrial uses.) So you never have to worry about gold going out of style as a money item. Its continued value is based upon somet hing sure and reliable. If your neighbor refuses to accept it in exchange from you, you can still take it to a jeweler or a dental supply c ompany and receive something of value for it. That previously determined value also tells you how much gold is worth in relationship to other commodities. If t he money commodity didn’t have that separate value, you couldn’t confi dently accept it in trade for what you have produced, for you wouldn’t know the worth of what you received. Gold, as either an industrial or monetary commodity , is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as is any oth er commodity. Overproduction will cause its market value to drop. On the other hand, a shortage of gold would increase its value and thereby encourage prospecting and production. T here has never really been a long-term shortage of gold in the wor ld; and there certainly isn’t one today. It is being produced at an ever increasing rate. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. The evolution of our money system must continue. Up to this point, we’ve recognized two important si gnposts that will have great significance when we get to the pra ctical application of these principles of money: 1. You produce or exchange only when you believe it will lead ultimately to something you want. 2. Money is a commodity that is accepted in exchang e by an individual who intends to trade it for something el se. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 18 Putting these two together, we find that you would not accept “money” in exchange if you didn’t believe it would lead to the purchase of an item you really wanted. That leads us to some further developments in mone y. In the next few pages, we’ll see the transition from the primit ive society (our island example, employed to isolate the purpose of each in dividual in an exchange) to the modern, complicated economy in whi ch we live. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 19 2 What Is Paper? In any market the natural impulse of an ambitious i ndividual is to look around for ways of making life easier for other peo ple — knowing they will pay him a handsome profit for what he makes av ailable to them. Now that our little community has grown, and gold h as replaced nails as the major money commodity, one enterprisin g fellow notices that individuals waste a lot of time measuring gold dust in exchange for their drinks at the bar. So he opens a mint. He buys raw gold or silver from miners and converts the metal into coins. He stamps the coins with his name and the amount of gold inside the coin. If an individual trusts the coin-maker, he will pro bably prefer to use the coin in exchange. Its recognizable weight m akes it easier than measuring gold dust. But since no one wants to trade for something that may be worthless, he must be sure there’s really gold (in the amount indicated) inside the coin. Not only that, he has to know that others will accept the coin, too. The coins must be stamped with the seal of someone who has gained widespread respect in the marketplace. For a n individual will be willing to accept the coin only when he’s sure of t he value of the commodity in the coin. 1   1 In case you’re wondering if this applies to copper- nickel “coins,” we will come to them shortly. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 20 Exchange is made easier as individuals trade coins instead of continually measuring gold dust. But the evolution continues. another ambitious chap opens a warehouse. “Bring your gold to me,” he says. “I’ll store it for you in my theft-proof vault. I’ll give you a receipt for your gold, so you can claim it any time you want it. I charge only a small fee for the service of storing it for you.” This means you can now keep your gold in a safe war ehouse — rather than having it at home where it could be sto len. You have the receipts in your possession; you can t ake them to the warehouse and get your gold whenever you need i t. And as the use of the warehouse becomes more widesp read, and the integrity of the warehouseman becomes known, th e receipts can serve an additional purpose. You can exchange the r eceipts themselves. Why bother going to the warehouse to get your gold, only to trade it to someone who will probably take it back to the same warehouse for safekeeping? Instead, you simply hand over the receipt to him. In the process, title to the gold has passe d from you to him. Receipts add to the ease of exchange because it’s e asier to transfer the paper than to transfer the gold itself . But at this important stage in the evolution of the money system, we must remind ourselves of an important point : it is the gold that is the money; the paper receipts are not money . Gold is money because it’s a commodity with accepte d value and is convenient to use in exchange. The use of wa rehouse receipts won’t change that. All you receive from the warehou se is a piece of paper, acknowledging that there is gold which belon gs to you at the warehouse. Paper could not be useful as money because the relative ease with which it’s produced makes it inexpensive by na ture; you’d have to use tons of it to obtain the same result served by a few ounces of gold. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 21 The paper takes on value only as it can be exchange d for gold. If the warehouse were to refuse to make gold available , the receipt would eventually be worthless. It’s similar to storing furniture. You can’t sit on a furniture receipt; you can only exchange it for something to sit on. The paper receipts are not money; they are money substitutes . They are receipts that can be readily exchanged for real money. 2 It is obvious that no one is going to accept a piec e of paper just because you want him to. He must be confident that it will eventually bring him what he wants. So there are three essenti al characteristics required of a worthwhile money substitute, if it’s to retain its value: 1. The warehouse must have a good reputation . It isn’t enough that the receipt holder trusts the warehouse. It mu st have general acceptance in the market. Otherwise, the holder of the receipt will be limited to exchanging it for gold; he won’t be able to trade the receipt to someone else. 2. The real money must be readily accessible . If you couldn’t exchange your receipt for gold any time you wanted to, what lasting value would the receipt have? And that means . . . 3. The real money must be kept out of circulation . If the warehouseman were to spend your gold or lend it to someone else, how could you expect it to be available when you wanted it? If you hold a receipt, the gold in the warehouse ac tually belongs to you, not to the warehouse. It would be as prepos terous for the warehouseman to use your gold as it would be for the Ajax Van & Storage Company to use your furniture while you had it stored there (unless it had your permission).   2 Hereafter, I will use three terms interchangeably: money substitutes , money receipts , and paper money — each meaning receipts that are used in place of real money. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 22 Imagine, for example, that you walked into a friend ’s house and found him lying on your sofa. When you expressed yo ur shock, he told you that Ajax had rented your sofa to him because i t figured you wouldn’t be coming back to get it for a year or so. Pieces of paper, as titles to commodities, aren’t w orth much unless you can exchange them at any time of your choosing for the commodity itself. So to whatever extent any of the three requirements listed above is missing, the money substitute is bound to lose v alue. You are paying the warehouseman a fee for a service — the storing of your money. And the gold must be there a nd accessible for the receipts to have much value. Along with the normal paper receipts, it is possibl e to have tokens . A token is a money substitute in metallic form, r ather than in paper. The present U. S. copper-nickel tokens are a good example. These are not coins, since there is no significant inherent value (perhaps two cents worth of metal in a quarter). Th ey are money substitutes. Like paper money, they can only have l asting, constant value if they can be readily exchanged for somethin g of real value. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREDIT If the warehouse shouldn’t be lending out money tha t belongs to its customers, how can credit ever develop? Easily. Suppose you own some gold that you don’t in tend to spend for awhile. You agree to lend it to your next -door neighbor in exchange for an extra payment (interest) when he re turns the gold. Naturally, you know you won’t be able to use the mo ney while it is on loan to your neighbor. The essential ingredient of real credit is that one person gives up the use of his money in order to allow someone else to use it. He is paid interest for temporarily getting along without the money."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 23 Warehouses can play an important part in this. The warehouseman can be aware of who needs money and wh o has it to lend. For example, you agree to leave a certain sum of go ld in the warehouse for a definite period of time — one year, let us say. To compensate you, the warehouse will pay you interest of 3% on your money. Now that the warehouseman knows you won’t demand yo ur money for a year, he can lend it to another custome r at 6% interest — repayable within one year. You have agreed to give up the use of the money while the other person has it. You both can’t have it to spend at the same time. In this case, you will not receive a receipt for yo ur gold; because you have no claim upon it for a year. Instead, you will receive a note that entitles you to pick up your gold plus the int erest at the end of the year. Here we have the difference between demand deposits and time deposits . A demand deposit is the storing of your money, fo r which you pay a fee — in exchange for the convenience of using r eceipts. You can demand your money at any time. A time deposit is the giving up of your money for a specified length of time, for which you receive a fee — interest. And, of course, the warehouse is merely the forerun ner of the modern-day bank. The bank is the place where people store their money and where savings are lent out to obtain interest. So let’s substitute the word bank for warehouse; although it won’t change any of the principles involved. No matter what we call the warehouse, you’ll produc e or exchange only when you believe it will lead ultimat ely to something you want. You aren’t going to give up your producti on or your property in exchange for a piece of paper you think might be worthless. (It is possible, of course, to trade for a piece of paper that is becoming worthless without your knowing it.)"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 24 If, by now, you’ve thought to yourself: “My heavens , this is all so painfully obvious,” then I’m glad you think so. If what we’ve seen so far is obvious, then it will be easier to see how distort ed our present-day monetary structure has become when we examine it la ter on. What we’re reviewing now is obvious — but only in this simplified form. It’s not as easy to see these prin ciples amid the complexities of the modern economy, but they still exist. THE SIZE OF THE MONEY SUPPLY A number of fallacies have developed regarding the size of the money supply necessary to serve a community. As with any other commodity, the overproduction of nails or gold or silver (or whatever is the money commodity) will just lessen the value of each unit of that commodity in exchange. This identifies one element in the setting of pric es. Suppose one horse and one cow are approximately equal in ge neral market value. If prices are expressed in terms of gold, th en the price of each might be five ounces of gold. If the money supply were somehow doubled, one hors e would still be equal to one cow; but both of them would s oon be priced at ten ounces of gold. Consumers would have more gold to s pend but there would have been no increase in the number of produc ts on which to spend it. They would inevitably bid more in order to obtain what they wanted from the limited supply available. And this would cause prices to rise to a level relative to the new, larger, mon ey supply. From this we can formulate an equation that shows h ow the general price level of the community is determined. At any moment in history, there will be a fixed num ber of goods and services in the market, available for purchase. At the same time,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 25 there will be a certain supply of money in the hand s of prospective buyers, usable for purchases. All the goods and services will compete against eac h other for the available money. And all the monies will compet e for the available goods and services. The general price level will be determined by divid ing the available goods and services into the available mon ey, creating a formula: Available Money Supply Available Goods & Services = General Price Level Or, expressed in a different way, General Price Level = Money ÷ Goods This is an abstract equation — meaning that its onl y purpose is to help us visualize what’s happening. We could nev er hope to know the exact amount of money available for purchasing at any given moment; nor is there even any way to measure all th e horses and cows and TV repair services in any uniform way. But the equation serves to show us that the greater the money supply, the higher prices will be . Not because a larger money supply makes the products more valuable; but rather becaus e the larger money supply makes the money less valuable. The prices of products are expressed in terms of money. The more money there i s, the more will be bid on each item until the supply of available m oney is used up on the supply of available objects. This isn’t just probable; it’s inevitable. If consu mers suddenly received gold nuggets that had rained down from hea ven, they wouldn’t leave prices where they’d been previously. Each con sumer would attempt to take advantage of his apparent new wealt h to bid more for what be wanted, hoping to bid it away from others. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 26 In the process, prices would invariably go up; the money supply would have increased, but not the available goods a nd services. No new wealth would have been created (except to whatever extent gold is in demand as a commercial or industrial commodity). If the money supply decreased, prices would drop. T here would not be enough money to buy up the available goods a t the old general price level. Within the general price level, there will be wide variat ions of prices among the commodities as consumers express t heir preferences. Some prices will even be dropping — while others ar e going up, as consumers change their minds and rearrange the valu es they have placed on various items. But the general price index will necessarily result from the amount of money available for spending and the numb er of objects available for purchase.  "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 27 3 What Is Inflation? America is the land of opportunity. So I’m going to suggest that you and I go into business together (at least in your i magination, so I can pose my puzzle to you). You and I form a partnership, a company that prints counterfeit money. We print 1,000 new $20 bills. Then we go into San Diego where our affluence (or l ack of it) is not known to anyone. We start spending the bills and are immediately pra ised by the local merchants and the newspapers. They proclaim t hat it is a great thing for San Diego that we have come to town, for we’re bringing prosperity to a city that perhaps was in a recessio n. Two weeks later, we leave town with $20,000 worth o f goods. The townspeople bid us grateful farewell for all th e business we have brought to them. It’s obvious that we have benefited from the situation. We traded paper dollars with no real value for products that have real value. Assuming that no one ever learns our little secret, has our gain actually hurt anyone else? In other words , does anyone ever pay for the benefits gained by counterfeiters ? Set the book down for as long as it takes to think about that question. Did anyone lose in order for us to gain f rom our counterfeit spree? And, if so, who? * * * What’s your answer?"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 28 The merchants who received the counterfe it bills didn’t lose. They could pass the bills on to others for things t hey wanted. (Part of our assumption was that no one would discover the c ounterfeiting.) We gained; the merchants didn’t lose. Apparently, n o one lost. But we’ve overlooked a few people. Not just a few, in fact . We’ve overlooked everyone else in the marketplace . For everyone else will lose in order to make this gain possible. We can see this easily as we imagine our car leaving San Diego — loaded with goods removed from San Diego’s market place. We leave San Diego’s residents with less property than they had before we came. There will be fewer goods available to divide up among the people there. In exchange, they received additional paper money t hat will circulate in the community. But paper money isn’t w ealth. It simply means there is now more paper money to bid for fewer goods and services. Referring back to our price level formula, we see t hat the general price level is determined by dividing the a vailable goods and services into the available money supply. Since the money supply has gone up and the goods and services have decreased, the result can only be a higher price level in San Diego . The price increase will be irregular. Those who get their hands on the counterfeit money first will gain from it; f or they’ll have extra spending money, and prices won’t have gone up yet. But as that extra paper money passes through the community, it will b id prices upward. The other people in the marketplace will be paying for our gain — and they will do that through the higher prices they pa y for each product . Let’s carry the example a little further. Suppose o ur arrival and departure weren’t noticed. In other words, no one w as aware that an extra $20,000 was suddenly coming into circulation. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 29 The individual merchants who received our $20 bills would have no reason to suppose there was anything unusua l or temporary about the increase in business. They’d simply suppo se that their long-standing promotional efforts were finally payi ng off — that success was on its way at last. They would most likely hire extra clerks to handle the increased business, maybe order a new sign and a better paint job for the store. And they’d enlarge their inventories to meet the in creased demand, of which we appeared to be an example. But as soon as it became evident that the sudden do se of new business was purely temporary, they’d have to retra ct their expansion plans. They would lay off the extra clerks and canc el the orders for remodeling. The painter who was to have done the remodeling wou ld, in turn, have to fire his new helpers. And what would he do with all the extra paint he’d ordered? The net result throughout the area would be a state of gloom. Everyone would have extra commitments to pay off an d shelves full of undesired stock — all because an illusory boom caus ed businessmen to gear up to a demand that never really existed. Would you call that a recession? Had the businessmen understood the artificial natur e of their sudden new business, they wouldn’t have made their mistaken investments. Instead, they’d have recognized the si tuation for what it was — a sudden, temporary windfall. It was the inab ility to calculate the true nature of the situation that led to what w e think of as a recession. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Instead, let me give you another puzzle to ponder, before we go on. Suppose I’ve earned 100 ounces of gold by working i n the marketplace. Now that I have it, I decide not to spend it. I won’t even"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 30 lend it to someone else or put it in the bank. Inst ead, I go home and bury the 100 ounces of gold in the backyard. I steadfastly refuse to spend it. Some of my friend s (who are Harvard economists) come to me and plead with me to spend the money. “After all,” they say, “if you spend it, it’ ll provide employment for others.” But I still refuse to spend the money. It remains i n a hole in the backyard. What happens as a result? Is anyone hurt by my action? If so, who? Does anyone gain from my action? If so, who? Again, set down the book for as long as it takes to ponder the question. * * * What’s your answer? The only possible loser in such a case would be I — the one who has the money and refuses to spend it. Even then, i f I have decided (for whatever reason) that I don’t want to spend it, you could hardly say that I’m hurt. But the fact is that I’m simply depriving myself. I ’ve produced something in the marketplace that other people now enjoy. The gold I received was my claim to goods and services in the market. When I spend the gold, I’m claiming my reward for the thin gs I’ve already given to others. If I refuse to exercise that claim, I am the loser — for I’ll have fewer goods and services to enjoy. And, in the proc ess, I’ll have left that many more goods and services in the market for others to have . This highlights a very popular economic fallacy. Mo st people believe the market benefits from my purchase . But that isn’t the case. The market as a whole benefits from my production , not my purchase. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 31 When I produce, I add to the total number of goods and services available. When I purchase, I reduce that supply. M y purchase is simply the claiming of my reward. If I don’t claim it, onl y I suffer the consequences. Well then, if I choose to forfeit my reward, who wi ll gain? Everyone else will profit from my refusal to spend my money. There will be just that many more goods and services left for the others to split up — since I didn’t take my share. And how will that be reflected in practice? Prices will be affected by the change in the money supply. As I remove 100 ounces of gold from circulation, prices will drop accordingly (see our price formula). So now everyon e can buy more goods with the money he already has. The larger the money supply, the higher prices are. The smaller the money supply, the lower prices are. ORGANIZED COUNTERFEITING In a free market, the gold stock would undoubtedly respond easily and quietly to changes in the volume of good s produced. If the available supply of products increased, prices woul d drop. That would make each ounce of gold more valuable than it was b efore, and this in turn would encourage greater production of gold. On the other hand, if gold were overproduced tempor arily, prices would rise and each ounce of gold would be l ess valuable in exchange. The gold miner would be getting less in r eturn for his efforts. This would discourage production. Remember: it’s not the volume of production or the volume of sales that’s important to you; it’s what you eventu ally receive for what you’ve done that counts. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 32 So if gold mining responds smoothly to changes in m arket needs, the market would seldom ever be disrupted by sudden changes in price levels. However, an intricate economy (like the one in whic h we live) will use the money substitutes to a much greater de gree than the real money. And there’s plenty of room for manipulation of the money substitutes. It’s possible for new paper money to c ome into circulation without increasing the production or storage of rea l money. And this brings us to the next important element in understanding the money system: inflation . Inflation is an increase in money substitutes above the stock of real money in storage. 3 Inflation simply means there are more paper money r eceipts in circulation than there is real money with which to back them up. As we’ve seen, this will cause prices to go up. But ri sing prices are not inflation; they are an effect of inflation. Rising prices can result from several different causes (decreased production, for example); but only when they result from an overproduction of paper mo ney do they cause seemingly mysterious changes in the economy. It is possible for prices to remain stable or even drop during an inflationary period. This would happen if the produ ction of goods and services increased faster than the increase in pape r money (Prices = Money ÷ Goods). But prices would still be higher than they would ha ve been without the inflation .   3 The definitions used in this book have been created by the author. The purpose of a definition is to establish precise communication between author and reader, not to adh ere to any authoritative concept. The worth of a definitio n comes from its ability to draw a sharp line between what is a certain thing and what isn’t. There are several def initions of the word “inflation” in popular use; but this on e isolates the one factor that has the greatest effec t upon general economic conditions. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 33 We should note also that the price formula will wor k in the same way whether the money supply element refers to real money (gold or silver) or to money substitutes. An increase in mon ey substitutes will cause prices to go up, even if the stock of real mo ney has remained constant; for the formula is affected by whatever i s bid for the available goods and services in the market. Let’s return now to the development of our money sy stem. Suppose you left your gold on demand deposit at the bank (warehouse) and received a receipt that you intended to spend i n the marketplace. But the banker didn’t store the gold; he lent it to someone else — in order to earn interest on money that isn’t his. Or perhaps he just issued a second receipt to someone else. In either case, two people would be trying to spend the same gold at the same time. You would have inflation — two receipts for the same supply of gold. One consequence of this would be the well-known “ru n on the bank.” As soon as anyone became suspicious that the banker was doing this, he’d get jittery about his own money. “Heavens,” he’d say, “if there isn’t enough gold in the bank to cover every receipt, then someone will be out of lu ck if everyone decides to turn in his receipts for gold. That may not happen — but why take a chance? So, even though I’m a public-spirite d citizen who doesn’t want to undermine confidence in our institu tions, I have too many humanitarian projects in mind for my gold. So I’d better run down to the bank and get my gold out while there’s still some to get!” If very many people became suspicious, you’d have a run on the bank. And those who arrived there last would be out of luck — if the bank really were cheating on the receipts. If it we ren’t, everyone would get his gold and the bank’s honesty would be proven . This would probably result in increased business for the bank. An honest bank would not have to fear a run. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 34 But if the banker is inflating, and can keep that fact hidden, what then? Obviously, he’ll draw extra benefits from his ability to lend out gold that doesn’t belong to him. Who will pay for his benefits? The people in the co mmunity will pay the difference in higher prices, resulting from the increase of money substitutes in circulation. The example is no different from our glorious succe ss in San Diego. The paper money supply has been artificially increased and the people in the marketplace will pay higher prices as a result. The banker has caused inflation in the same way our counterfeiting hit San Diego. So let’s coin another definition of inflation, one more to the point: Inflation is the counterfeiting of paper money . Inflation is the printing of paper money substitute s that aren’t backed by real money. And it doesn’t matter who does the counterfeiting. Any increase in paper money — not backed by real money in storage — is going to cause the same react ion: prices will be higher than they would have been without the inflat ion. Well, we’ve already come a long way in the developm ent of our money system. We’ve seen banks or warehouses storin g gold and silver, and issuing receipts for them. (They can ev en store money substitutes and issue checking accounts as a second ary money substitute.) We’ve seen coins minted and circulated. Coins are a form of real money; while tokens are money substitutes. Lending and borrowing take place as one individual gives up the use of his money for a period of time. This can be done through time deposits in banks. Any bank that issued more receipts than its stock o f real money justified would be constantly vulnerable to a “run” that could put it out of business."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 35 Once those runs became common, individuals would pr obably become disenchanted with all banks; for how would you know which ones were honest and which weren’t? That would put the burden of proof on the honest banks to prove their honesty to the satisfaction of their customers. There are many ways by which that could be done, but it isn’t necessary to go into them here. If the banks overprint the receipts and no bank run s take place (so that inflation continues unchecked), then, as w e’ve seen, prices go up artificially and cause reactions in the marketpl ace. We now have all the important elements of a money s ystem at our disposal. So we can leave our island and our wa rehouses and proceed to modern-day conditions to see what is hap pening around us. Our examination of the primitive beginnings of mone y has been useful to us, however. For it has isolated and iden tified the principles that exist in any economy. By concentrating on a fe w elements, we have been able to see them more clearly. No matter how intricate the economy, no matter how sophisticated “modern economics” may become, some t hings do not change. For example, you only produce or exchange when you believe it will lead ultimately to something you want . Because of that, actions in the marketplace have re actions, causes have effects, acts produce consequences. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 36 4 The Government and Money The government eventually becomes deeply involved i n any economy. It’s not our purpose here to examine the merits or demerits of governmental intervention in the economy. What is o f immediate concern is the government’s involvement in the mone y supply. The government inevitably takes over the money syst em in any country. To understand why this control is so impor tant to governments, we need to digress temporarily. There are three ways for a government to raise the financial resources for its spending activities: taxing, borr owing, and printing. 1. When taxation is the method, it’s not hard to see that one man’s subsidy from the state is another man’s tax. The total amount of property in the society hasn’t increased; it has on ly, been redistributed according to the government’s wishes. 2. If the government borrows the funds it spends, nothing changes. Eventually the funds will be due for repay ment. That means the taxpayers will pay the bill; or else the loans will be repudiated — which means the lenders pay instead of the taxpayer s in general. We should also notice that, in the short term, the resources the government has borrowed could have been used in the private sector of the economy. These resources have been removed from private use as emphatically as if they’d been confiscated through taxation. Private investment has been curtailed by the amount of the government’s borrowings. Two people cannot use the same money at the same time. 3. This brings us to the most subtle method. It is inflation. The government, in effect, merely prints extra money su bstitutes and spends"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 37 them for what it wants. We have already seen, however, that these money substitutes only take on purchasing power at the expense of the other money substitutes which are thereby reduced in purchasing power . Prices are invariably higher than they otherwise would have be en. Just as in our San Diego example, fewer goods and s ervices are available to the rest of the population. The differ ence is what the government has confiscated through the use of its c ounterfeit paper money. No matter how the government covers its spending bi lls, the end result is that the individuals in the marketplace h ave paid the cost. Whether government obtains its resources by taxing, borrowing, or printing, the people in general have lost purchasin g power to the extent the government has been spending. But the third method has a highly useful advantage: few people realize what is going on . In fact, as prices edge upward, people blame businessmen or the unions for causing what they cal l “inflation.” Actually, it is the government that has taken their resources, but they don’t know it. So inflation is the most subtle kind of taxation; it is always attractive to governments. For example, the government can “benevolently” gran t a “tax cut” periodically. But a look at the budget reveals that spending is continuing to increase. How can this be? All that h appens, of course, is a shift in emphasis from method one to method three — from taxing to printing. Whenever the government spends, the people must giv e up something . You can’t create something out of nothing. This brief digression demonstrates why controlling the money system is so important to any government. With this control, it can tax through inflation. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 38 THE INEVITABLE TAKEOVER Although the details will change from one country t o another, we should be able to draw a composite picture of a government moving into a position of control over the money system. T his takeover will be in six basic steps: 1. The first step is for the government to go into the warehouse business , issuing its own paper money. In no time at all, i t succumbs to the temptation of step two: 2. It prints more receipts than its gold stock justifi es . This, of course, is inflation. In doing so, however, the government runs into our basic rule of money: you only produce or exchange when you believ e it will lead ultimately to something you want. This means that individuals aren’t going to accept the government’s inflationary money receipts — when the y can get more valuable receipts from other sources. 3. Eventually this prompts the government to declare itself to be the monopoly warehouse for gold . That means no one else may issue receipts for gold. From this point onward, banks ar e merely storage houses for paper money receipts — since they can’t issue their own receipts. But our rule still applies; and individuals respond in their own self-interests by refusing to accept the government ’s depreciating currency, preferring to use gold and silver. 4. Seeing its receipts refused , the government then passes a “legal tender” law — which says you must accept the government’s paper money; it’s a crime to turn it down when some one offers it to you in payment of a debt or obligation. If that’s to be the case, then most individuals wil l accept the paper money; but then they’re more prone to turn it in for gold as soon"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 39 as they get it. They hesitate to hold the paper mon ey for any length of time, preferring to store the gold instead. The government, however, labels such storing “hoard ing.” But the rush to turn in the legal tender for gold is si mply the traditional run on the bank — only this time it’s the government’s bank. 5. And so, after creating sufficient rationalizatio n for its action, the government confiscates all the gold — and declares that henceforth no private citizen may own gold (all this in the “p ublic interest,” of course). The government will store all the gold (store it, n ot “hoard” it). And you are to use the paper receipts the governmen t has decreed others must accept from you. The government can’t, however, guarantee what other s will give you in return for that paper money — although it ma y try to do so by invoking price controls. The confiscation of gold took place in America in 1 933. Since then, we have thus been limited to the use of paper money, while the government uses the gold to settle international ba lances. 6. Along with this , the government takes control of the banking system . The effect of the six-step program has been to conf iscate the gold, outlaw all competition in money substitutes, and control the banking system. This is total monetary control. THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM The government’s control of the banking system is m ost important. In modern economics, the banks provide t he most effective engine of inflation. So let’s turn our attention to the nature of the government’s power. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 40 The biggest single step forward in control of the b anking system took place in 1913, with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act. All large banks in the nation are members of the Federa l Reserve System. Nationally chartered banks are forced to join; stat e-chartered banks can choose. The system consists of twelve Reserve Banks, locate d throughout the country. These twelve Reserve Banks are supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syste m, who are appointed by the President of the United States. Some people claim that the Federal Reserve System i s a private enterprise. Nothing could be further from the truth . It’s as much a part of the government as the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Credit Corporation, or the Federal Trade Commission . The error probably stems from the fact that commerc ial banks own “stock” in the Reserve Banks. This isn’t by cho ice, however; each is forced to put up 6% of its own capital in the ne arest Reserve Bank. Dividends are paid on this; but the dividend is fix ed. A commercial bank receives a straight 6% of its inves tment, not 6% of the Reserve Bank’s profits. So the bankers actually onl y earn 6% on the investment they’ve been forced to make — not a very exciting return in the banking business. The remaining profits are turned over to the federa l Treasury; and that’s where the “big profits” go. Over $7,000, 000,000 have been turned over to the government since 1947. Those profits are not the main interest of the gove rnment, however. It’s more concerned with using the banks a s a method of inflating the money supply. For there are actually three ways of inflating: (1) the printing of receipts, (2) the le nding of demand deposits, and (3) the creation of demand deposits. Let’s examine each of the three methods: The first method is the most obvious. The governmen t prints money receipts for which there is no real money as backing. It merely turns on the printing presses — simple counterfeiti ng."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 41 The second method is only slightly more involved. T hat method is to take money in storage as demand deposits and lend it to someone else. In this way, two people believe they have the use of the same money at the same time. As we’ve seen, only time de posits can be legitimately lent; for then the owner of the money has agreed to give up his use of the money while it is out on loan. Demand deposits have evolved into what we call chec king accounts, where you withdraw your funds by making a written demand — a check. Time deposits have become savings accoun ts. But, as you probably know, it’s easy to remove your funds from your savings account (even though the bank reserves the right to refuse). As it turns out, then, in both checking and savings accounts, banks are lending out funds that are there purely a s storage. No one has agreed to give up the funds for a specified length of time, except in special types of accounts — such as certificates of deposit. In order to understand the effect of this practice, let’s suppose you decide to attend an auction. There’s a group of vases there you like. They’ve been selling at past auctions for about $50 apiece. So you deposit $100 in your checking account, hoping to ac quire two vases and pay for them with a check. The bank, meanwhile, follows its normal practice an d lends out $90 of your deposit to someone else. You arrive at the auction and start bidding. When y ou bid $50, you expect to have won the first vase. But (surpris e!) someone across the room bids $60; and so you have to bid higher. The bidding continues until he bids $90 and you fin ally bid $100. At that point, he fails to respond and the va se is yours. But a vase you’d expected to buy for $50 has cost you $100. So you get only one vase with the money you’d expected would buy two. After the auction, you walk across the room and tal k with your adversary. In the process of the conversation, he t ells you that he"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 42 borrowed the money he used to bid against you. In f act, he borrowed it that very morning at your bank. You discover that he’s been bidding the price up against you with your own money ! The bank has taken your funds, lent them to someone else, and allowed your funds to bid up the price you have to pay. That’s a simplified example of how the lending of d emand deposits causes inflation. In the same way, banks l end out deposits, causing prices in general to go up — to the disadva ntage of those who deposited the money in the first place. But there’s a third way to inflate (a way that’s ev en more incredible). We’ll examine that method in the next chapter. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 43 5 How to Create Money Have you ever borrowed money at a bank? If so, thin k back to the occasion. When the loan was approved did the banker go to the vault, count out the money, and hand you the loan in cash? Probably not. More likely, he handed you a deposit slip, showing that he had credited your checking account with the amount of the loan. If you didn’t already have a checking account, he probably asked you to open one as a condition of the loan. In either case, there was no requirement that curre ncy be available to you. All that was necessary was for hi m to enter a figure in a ledger, crediting you with x number of dollars. I n other words, he may not even have had the cash he lent to you. But how could a banker do this? To understand, we need to take a brief look at what is called the fractional reserve banking system . The Federal Reserve System establishes reserve requ irements for commercial banks. In recent years, city banks h ave been required to keep at least 16½% of their checking account deposi ts on reserve at the nearest Reserve Bank. Rural banks have a lower rese rve requirement: 12½%. Savings account requirements are even smaller . To simplify the explanation, we’ll concentrate on t he city banks. Any bank in a metropolitan area must keep approxima tely one-sixth (16½%) of its checking account deposits at the Rese rve Bank. Suppose, for example, that the bank’s records show that its customers have $100,000 deposited in checking accounts. The bank m ust then have at least $16,500 in cash on deposit at the Reserve Ban k. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 44 The superficial purpose of the reserve requirement is to prevent the bank from lending out so much of its deposits t hat it would be highly vulnerable to a run. But, in practice, the r esult works out to something quite different. Since our partnership in the counterfeiting busines s was so successful, let’s try another venture. This time le t’s open a bank. On Monday morning, we open our doors for business f or the first time. The local newspaper carries our adverti sement for people to come in and deposit their funds. The result is that we receive $1,000 in deposits the first day. On Tuesday, we advertise for people to come in and borrow money from us. After all, we intend to make our pro fits by lending out the deposits and earning interest. Since our reserve requirement is 16½%, you’d expect that we’d send $165 of our new deposits to the Reserve Bank a nd lend out the remaining $835. (We’ll assume that our operating ex penses are paid out of our initial capital, to avoid complicating the e ssential matter involved.) In that case, our statement would look something li ke this: Deposits: $1,000 Loans:  $835 Cash Reserves: 165 (16½%) Liabilities: $1,000 Assets: $1,000 Our reserve requirement has been met; and we’ve len t out $835. That’s very simple and easy to understand; but it d oesn’t work that way. For we have the ability to inflate — actually to expand our deposits through loans. So it’s more likely that we ’ll proceed in this way: On Monday, we receive $1,000 in new deposits. On Tuesday, we send the entire $1,000 to the Reserve Bank as our reserve. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 45 Instead of viewing the $1,000 as our total deposit structure, we’ll use it as the reserve base and build a much l arger deposit structure on top of it. We then make new loans totaling $5,000 — by opening new checking accounts for the borrowers. Whenever anyon e asks for a loan, we just add the amount of the loan to his checking account balance. Our statement would then look like this: Deposits $6,000 Loans: $5,000 Cash reserves: 1,000 (16½%) Liabilities $1,000 Assets: $6,000 In other words, we’ll grant loans by issuing deposi t slips for money we don’t actually have. No one usually asks f or currency, anyway — at least not enough people to make a diffe rence. In the process, we expand our deposits by $5,000 to a total of $6,000. And we have a corresponding figure of $5,00 0 worth of loans on the other side of the ledger. Our financial statement balances, our books are in order, and the reserve requirement is being met. We’ve just done our bit to ease the tight money sit uation. This is the third method of inflation — the creation of demand deposits. It’s somewhat similar to the second metho d — the lending of demand deposits. Method three is much simpler and f aster, however; we just create the new deposits on top of the reserves. But there must be a flaw in all this somewhere. Aha ! What happens when the borrowers go out and spend their n ew checking account deposits? After all, they’re not seeking th e loans just to have funds sitting idly in checking accounts. They have something in mind for those funds. They’ll spend them by writing chec ks. Eventually, the town’s merchants are going to depos it these checks in their banks and those banks will come bac k to our bank and"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 46 say, “Give us cash for these checks issued on your bank.” What happens then? We don’t have the cash to give them; we never did. And we’d be in real trouble at this point, except for one littl e thing : the other banks have been doing the same thing we have . They’ve been inflating their deposits and so we’ve collected a lot of their chec ks, too. And so our checks are canceled out by th eir checks , provided we’re all inflating at the same rate . Different-sized banks can coexist and inflate side by side, so long as the rate of in flation is the same. That’s the job of the Federal Reserve System — to a ssure that uniformity of inflation. It has several tools with which to do this, the most basic of which is the reserve requirement. Wit h it, the system controls the volume of inflation in the nation. CONTROLLING INFLATION Suppose the reserve requirement were suddenly lower ed to 14%, or about one-seventh. That would enable us to pyramid our original $1,000 on reserve at the Reserve Bank still further . We could now create an additional $1,000 in deposits and loans. Deposits: $7,000 Loans: $6,000 Cash reserves: 1,000 (14%) Liabilities $1,000 Assets: $7,000 In other words, $1,000 in reserve will create $5,00 0 in loans when the reserve rate is 16½%. The same $1,000 in r eserve can create $6,000 in loans if the reserve rate is 14%. The result is a sudden addition to the nominal mone y supply of the nation. In this way, the Federal Reserve System has the ability to inflate or deflate the paper money supply of the na tion, just by raising or lowering the bank reserve requirements. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 47 The Reserve Banks also act as the clearing houses b etween banks, keeping track of the credits one has against the other. If any bank should temporarily be in higher debt than the others, the Reserve Bank can lend it the funds necessary to bail it out . This process, just described, is fractional reserve banking . No matter how much discussion may take place over the raising or lowering of reserve requirements or the efficiency of the operators of the system, the process itself is never challenged publicly. It’s become as much a part of the American way of life as high taxes. The Reserve Banks also issue the currency we use, t he green pieces of paper we call dollars . They’re actually Federal Reserve Notes. The greenbacks come into circulation as needed. If depositors at commercial banks desire to withdraw more currency, the banks call on the Reserve Banks for extra dollars to meet demands . The Reserve Banks print and issue the currency, as needed, to m eet the demands created by a constantly expanding deposit structure . In modern practice, then, the government doesn’t pr int paper money to cause inflation. It prints the paper money in response to the inflation that takes place through the bank’s depos it-loan expansion. But the government is still running the show. For t he Federal Reserve System determines the extent to which banks may inflate at any given time. Because of that expansion, all banks are highly vul nerable to runs. So the government has created the Federal Dep osit Insurance Corporation to reimburse you for your loss, up to $ 20,000 on any one account. With this insurance, you aren’t supposed t o see any reason for withdrawing your funds in shaky times. “After all, they’re as safe as the United States Government.” In reality, the FDIC is really nothing but a confid ence game. Its show of strength is intended to discourage deposito rs from withdrawing funds during shaky times. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 48 When a tiny bank in New Jersey was caught in an app arent swindle in 1970, the FDIC swooped in with photograp hers and made a grand display of paying off all the depositors. The event was reported from coast to coast and served to reinforce the pub lic impression that bank losses had died forever in the thirties. What’s overlooked is that the FDIC is only capable of dealing with small-time bank failures. Insured deposits in the U.S. in 1969 totaled $313 billion, while the FDIC fund to cover it amounted to only $4 billion. That amounts to slightly over 1¼% cover age. 4 And virtually all of the insurance fund is used to finance the government’s bonds. Only $6 million is kept in cash . The FDIC has nowhere near the funds to cover any la rge-scale bank runs. It could make good only by creating new fictitious demand deposits in other banks or by having more paper mon ey printed. In either case, the cure rivals the disease. THE PAPER MONEY SUPPLY Before reading this book, you may have assumed ther e were greenbacks in the bank vaults for every dollar cred ited to your checking account. If that were the case, the nation’s paper money supply would simply be the amount of currency that had been prin ted and issued. But, as we’ve seen, that isn’t the case. There are far more purchasing media than just the greenbacks. People a re writing checks for which there’s no currency in the bank. The nati on’s paper money supply is larger than just the currency. There are really three elements in the supply: 1. Currency outside of banks 2. Checking account deposits   4 FDIC Annual Report, 1969. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 49 3. Copper-nickel tokens Any currency inside the bank is probably covered by what’s already been credited to checking account deposits. In any event, it isn’t out in the community bidding up prices. So the only currency we count is that which people hold at home, in their pockets , in cash registers, or elsewhere outside of banks. The checking account deposits represent immediately spendable money substitutes. They’re available to bid up the prices of goods and services in the marketplace. Tokens that aren’t silver or gold are not coins, bu t money substitutes. The total of these three factors will be the paper money supply , the money substitutes that are supposedly backed by the government’s gold supply. This also constitutes the available money supply in our general price level formula. Obviously, this isn’t real money we’re talking about. Instead, it’s a great deal of inflat ed paper money, backed up by a small amount of real money. There are conflicting opinions concerning which ele ments should be included in the paper money supply. Some economists include savings accounts; others include savings an d loan deposits, etc. I’m keeping it as simple as possible here, since wh at we’re looking for doesn’t depend upon a precise figure. We’re also leaving out silver coins. There are so f ew in circulation that they don’t affect prices much. Eve n the entire amount held by the public would amount to less than 1% of the available paper money supply. Is there any limit to this paper money supply? The ultimate limits are, of course, the consequences of inflatio n that we’ll examine in the next few pages. There used to be legal limits, also. The law stated that the Federal Reserve System could only issue $1 40 in currency for each ounce of gold in the Treasury. That law has be en repealed.

But the “controls” are all on private indivi duals. There are far fewer controls on those who generate the inflation than there were in 1929. And since all these controls have been taken off, i t becomes vitally important to understand just what inflation does and where it leads, now that there are no longer any legal limit ations upon it.

Have you ever wondered why the higher your income goes, the greater the problems you seem to have in just g etting by? Oh sure, outwardly you’re doing well; but behind the facade there’s a constant problem meeting the monthly bills. Whether or not these specific problems have plagued you, there are a number of somewhat chaotic factors in today’s economy. And they make it very difficult to make rational long-t erm plans. To see things more clearly requires getting a broader pers pective, standing back from the immediate problem. We’ve seen that inflation, in the short term, pushe s prices upward. Prices aren’t necessarily higher than they were previously; but they’re always higher than they’d be without the in flation. And there will always be a sudden upsurge in demand at the specific points where the inflationary paper money is entering the community. The chief entry points in our economy to day are (1) through government spending — defense contracts and subsidies; and (2) through bank loans to businesses and consumers. The recipients are getting extra paper money that w ouldn’t have been theirs in the absence of inflation. They respo nd by gearing production up to a level that didn’t exist before. Businessmen order new capital equipment and add workers to the payroll. In the process, their purchases create new demands on other companies and industries, affecting them in much th e same way the inflation recipients have been affected. It might almost be called a law of nature that no one ever gets new income without raising expenses accordingly . Businessmen start"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 52 offering their suppliers more money to get deliveri es faster; and they start bidding workers away from competing companies . In fact, when a businessman gets a bank loan, he do esn’t hire the unemployed. For in reality, there are only two kind s of unemployed: (1) those who don’t want to work at prevailing wage lev els; and (2) those who are legally prevented from working at prevailin g wage levels by the various forms of minimum wage laws and union co ntracts. So the businessman gets most of his new workers by bidding them away from other jobs, pushing wages upward. In the process, the labor unions stage a gigantic s how of strength to indicate that they are responsible for the higher wage levels, which isn’t possible. All they can do is to move in and s oak up the excess bidding power created by inflation. If it weren’t for inflation, any successful union w age hikes would result in unemployment. For the companies inv olved would be priced out of business by the increased costs. But in an inflationary economy, there’s always more paper money in the han ds of the company’s customers; and that’s what makes the so-c alled wage-price spiral possible. 5 The two chief characteristics of the inflationary e conomy are (1) the unrealistic demands created for some companies and industries, and (1) the constantly rising price level. Our price fo rmula is working, silently but irresistibly; and it applies to prices , wages, everything. As the paper money flows through the market, it bid s prices higher and higher. So those who receive the new inf lationary money the   5 It’s true that inflation, by pushing prices and wag es upward, creates the illusion of a higher wage level . That can then induce some of the unemployed to go back t o work, thinking (erroneously) that the wage level is now m ore attractive. It can also push the prevailing levels above the legal minimum wage, freeing some other workers from involuntary unemployment.

But as it passes from hand to hand, prices get high er. And some individuals receive it just in time to offset the r ising price level and come out even. Further back down the line are others w ho receive it too late to break even. And way in the back of the scene are th ose whose incomes are not bid up by inflation. Those are the retired, the pe nsioners — the individuals who are on fixed incomes that don’t adj ust upward to inflation, even though prices are going steadily up ward. These individuals in the back of the scene are the ones who are paying for the gains of those getting the handouts from the government and the banks. Every gain received by a handout rec ipient must be accompanied by a loss to someone else who must now pay more for everything. Inflation amounts to nothing more than a redistribu tion of the wealth , a distortion of the purchasing pattern that would have taken place in the free market without inflation. Some pe ople get greater purchasing power at the expense of others whose pap er money will no longer buy as much. And yet, in the short run, inflation seems to be producing a “boom.” Prosperity appears to hit the economy when the government pumps new inflationary paper money into circulation . “After all, you have to admit we’ve never had it so good!” This is just another example of the visible gain an d the hidden loss. The so-called gains from inflation are always spectacular, while the losses are generally hidden from view. So let’s go behind the scenes and see the actual sequence of events produced by i nflation. A DAY IN THE LIFE . . . Each consumer is trying to satisfy his most urgent desires at any given time. He’ll allocate his limited income on so me basis, hoping to maximize his own objectives, whatever they may be."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 54 Let’s take a hypothetical engineer, working in an a erospace company. His take-home pay, after taxes, is $800 pe r month. Here’s an imaginary value scale for this consumer: $800 Monthly Budget 1. Food $ 100 2. Housing 200 3. Clothing 100 4. Education 50 5.

With the $50 left over after taking care of these objectives, he feeds a savings account for the futu re. Notice that there are numbers on this imaginary val ue scale. They are important, because the eight or ten items listed here aren’t the only things he’d like to have. There are hundreds of other things in the world he’d love to have, if he only had the money. As a matter of fact, we can see that he’d very much like a swimming pool — but it’s just out of his reach. He’ s also wanted a yacht, but his $800 per month will only go so far. He gets down to item #8 and the budget is used up. It isn’t that he can’t buy the swimming pool or the yacht. But he’s not willing to give up more important things t o get them. Instead,"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 55 he spends an hour or two a day at his desk dreaming of the swimming pool that he knows he can’t afford. But one day the boss calls him into his office to t ell him some good news. “Bumstead,” he says, “the company has ju st received a new government contract. That means we can now give you a raise. Your take-home pay is going up by $100 a month.” Naturally, our hypothetical hero isn’t concerned wi th national questions of inflation and the like. All he knows i s that someone has finally realized how talented he is and he’s been r ewarded with a long-overdue raise. He rushes home, tells his wife, and they spend a go od four minutes trying to decide what to do with the raise. They rush out and buy that swimming pool, probably by obligating them selves for the $100 per month the new raise is bringing him. And the visible effects of his purchase (and the pu rchases of others like him) produce the appearance of a boom. “Look at all the swimming pools; and people are eating at more expen sive restaurants, driving better cars. After all, wouldn’t you really rather live in a society where people can afford swimming pools, in addition to the necessities of life?” There’s only one problem. Prices are rushing upward to meet the increased paper money supply caused by inflation — the same inflation that deceived him into thinking he’d received a rai se. And a few months after the raise, he finds that it now costs him $100 per month more to live in the same old routine than it did before he received the raise. The raise has been completely absorbed by inflation , as the eight most important items on his value scale have gone u p in price. It now costs $900 per month to do what previously cost onl y $800.

Changes will have to be made in order to cram the pool into the budget — now that prices have gone up so much. For as long as it takes to pay off the pool, he’ll have to go without some of the things he’d always taken for gr anted. He’s now purchasing what he used to, plus a swimming pool, less some things he considered more important than a swimming pool. What, then, is the net effect of inflation on his l ife? He now purchases approximately as much as before; but the distribution of his purchases has been artificially altered by the curv e he was thrown by inflation. Had he been given a clear-cut choice, he’d never ha ve bought the swimming pool. He’d have chosen his former rout ine as he did until inflation distorted his decisions. He was always in a position to buy a swimming pool before. All he had to do was to give up something else; but he didn’t want to do that. Now his life is less enjoyable because he was temporarily deceived into thinking he could hav e more than was really possible. And he was one of the first to get the inflationary paper money.

Businessmen are gearing up to these new demands — s wimming pools, expensive restaurants, better cars, etc. But as soon as the inflationary currency has made o ne complete pass through the market, prices will begin to stabi lize again at a new, higher level. That’s the point where the consumers realize that s omething has gone wrong with their calculations; and they attemp t to reassert their"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 58 old routines. This brings about failures in the gla mour industries — swimming pool companies, entertainment, expensive r estaurants, etc. But, as we can see, it will also cause slowdowns in the more basic industries, such as food and clothing and housing. The outward picture is that of the economy passing from a boom stage into a recession. “Too bad; it looked as thou gh we really had all-out prosperity for awhile; but now this recessi on.” During the first stage, businessmen were gearing up to respond to the apparently upgraded tastes of the consumers. We seemed to be entering an era in which everyone would have more. But the truth was that nothing had actually changed . We still had the same amount of resources to work with; we still had the same general level of technical competence. But inflatio n deceived us into redistributing our resources temporarily toward mor e glamorous industries. And when the inflationary cycle is over, the busine ssmen are required to face the fact that they had geared up t o a fairy-tale market. Now they must grit their teeth, accept their losses , and resolve not to be fooled again. Mistakes will have to be liquidated, wasted man-hou rs written off. This is a recession . Perhaps it’s easier now to see what a recession really is. It is the liquidation period following an inflation ary cycle . But no government wants the embarrassment of that: and so the money managers look for a way of warding off the re cession. And in thousands of years of recorded monetary history, on ly one temporary solution has ever been discovered. Governments know only one way of holding back a recession. What do you suppose it is ? (How did you know?) "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 59 Yes, the only solution they know is to continue the inflation . The “boom” is re generated with more bank credit and government subsidies. Companies appear to come to life again. Prices go higher, but in such irregular patterns th at businessmen and wage-earners are unable to make rational decisi ons from the distorted price structure. Inefficient businessmen stay in business with more credit — at the expense of other companies that are offering to satisfy more basic consumer demands. And, through all this, the consumer is in a daze . His concept of his buying power is totally distorted. He sits by h is swimming pool, eating a can of beans for dinner. He drives to work in a new car, while his children go without dental care and his furnitu re falls apart. Not surprisingly, many individuals begin to think l ess of themselves, feeling incapable of coping with life i n an efficient manner.

It’s also true that whenever an individual begins t o allow for inflation in his calculations, inflation speeds up and manages to stay out in front of him.  "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 61 7 Inflation Starts to Gallop So the government’s inflation didn’t produce prospe rity, after all. It simply distorted our choices temporarily. Why, then, bother to pump inflation into the econom y in the first place? Because those who control the inflation (the banks and the government) benefit so much from it. And, usually, those who are first in line at the subsidy window are the most vocal el ements in the market. The government invokes inflation as a way of appear ing to create prosperity — as a way of financing, on a sub tle basis, its own programs. Once underway, the inflationary program m ust be sustained in order to ward off the recession that will inevit ably follow. The additional inflation is simply postponing the d ay of reckoning. And it’s covering up a greater and great er number of miscalculations that must come to light eventually. These mistakes can’t be hidden forever; but the government hopes t hey can (or at least until another administration is in office). And so the binge continues, guaranteeing an even worse readjustment period ahead. The longer the cycle las ts, the bigger the inflation, the greater number of miscalculations to be liquidated, the worse the recession to come. But now another element enters the picture. As the money managers attempt to continue the cycle, they find t hat their doses of inflation don’t have the effect they once had. Cert ainly our anti-hero, Joe Consumer, isn’t going to be fooled again by ano ther $100 raise; he’s wise now. But if the next one were to be $150? Ah , that’s a different story. “Now I’m really getting ahead,” he thinks. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 62 It’s not that the money managers are consciously ai ming to throw our Dagwood Bumstead a curve. They just look at the business trends and become aware of the need for bigger and bigger doses of inflation. So the subsidy programs get bigger and the bank cre dit expansion gets more feverish. But, as always, react ions are taking place that weren’t anticipated. For example, the government suffers from having to pay higher prices than expected, just as everyone does. Just l ike us, it plans its budget with today’s prices in mind; but inflation i s pushing those prices upward. So it, too, runs to the bank and borrows to meet a higher-than-expected deficit. But the paper money won’t be there to buy the gover nment’s bonds unless the reins on inflation are loosened a little more. So one feeds on the other and vice versa. At the same time, individuals notice the paper mone y depreciating rapidly, and they become afraid to hol d it. They try to spend it faster. Less savings are available for rea l credit, creating pressure for phony credit. And when savings accounts go down, interest rates g o up. The government tries to push the rates down by feeding more paper money into the system, hoping to make money more “plentif ul.” What we’re seeing here are the ways in which the fi res of inflation are fanned: (1) bigger spending programs are needed to keep the “boom” from collapsing; (2) unexpectedly higher prices cause the government to borrow more, requiring more inflation to make it possible; and (3) savings accounts become less attr active and consumers spend more; so more inflation appears to be the way to hold interest rates down. Each of these things encourages the expansion of in flation at an ever-increasing rate. It multiplies; it doesn’t add . One thing feeds on another; and it becomes harder and harder to hold i t in check. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 63 When it gets going fast enough, you have runaway inflation (or hyper-inflation ) — where the paper money is depreciating hourly. A nd within a short period of time, the entire monetary system collapses. History is riddled with examples of runaway inflati on. It reached such a critical stage during the French Revolution that the state decreed violations of its legal tender law to be guillotine offenses. Yet people still refused to accept the worthless currency. 6 In 1923, Germans were paying a billion marks for a loaf of bread. And there was China at the end of the Second World War — and Brazil and Holland and Indonesia and on and on and on. Naturally, in each case, the cry before the crisis was “You never had it so good!” As Ludwig von Mises has pointed out, the government is the only agency that can take a useful commodity like p aper, slap some ink on it, and make it totally worthless. POISON OR HANGING? Somewhere in this fool’s paradise, the money manage rs reach a critical fork in the road. After having inflated st eadily, they reach a point where all the many alternatives that were onc e available have disappeared. There are only two dismal alternatives left. One choice is to continue inflating. But by this po int, it’s gone too far. Further inflation means they’ll lose contr ol completely and runaway inflation will take over. But the only other alternative is to stop the infla tion. And that will bring to light all the miscalculations of the past. It means an embarrassing liquidation period ahead. Only it won’ t be just a recession. Now inflation has gone so far that the r eadjustment period   6 An excellent case history of runaway inflation is p rovided in Andrew Dickson White’s Fiat Money Inflation in France . "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 64 will be a full-scale depression, with widespread bu siness failures, unemployment, and bank closings. In fact, at this point, it doesn’t require a deflat ion (removal of paper money from circulation) in order to cause a r ecession. It doesn’t even require an end to currency expansion . Just slow down the rate of increase and you bring on the depression. So this is their choice now: runaway inflation or d epression. The money managers may not even be aware that they’ve a rrived at that juncture. They may go right on inflating, unaware o f the consequences. But once they’ve reached that fork in the road, it’ s far too late to turn back and correct their mistakes. THE GOLD DRAIN While all this is going on, the money managers are also fighting on another front. Inflation makes many people jittery about the futur e of the currency. And so those who can turn in their dollar s for gold (mainly foreign banks and governments) do so, as they see t he value of the dollar rapidly sliding downward. The gap between the gold supply and the money subst itute volume reaches a point where a run on the gold seem s inevitable. And no one likes to be last in line at a run. Preserving the remaining gold becomes a national pr oblem. Such things as “balance of payments” become importa nt issues. Attempts are made to keep American citizens from en hancing their lives by buying attractive foreign goods. Controls are often imposed that discourage, or totally prohibit, the sending o f money to foreign countries. It’s interesting to note that, without inflation, t here’d never be any such thing as a “balance of payments” problem. Every dollar that could be spent (and eventually turned in to the Tre asury) would have"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 65 gold to back it up. Foreign trade would be encourag ed as a way of widening our choices. But with inflation, it’s a big problem. And the gov ernment watches its gold supply getting smaller and smaller , until the situation becomes desperate. Here, too, a juncture is finally reached where there are only two alternatives left. One obvious alternative is deflation — withdraw some of the excess paper money from circulation. That would clo se the gap between the gold supply and the volume of outstandi ng money substitutes, reducing the overwhelming demands on t he gold stock. But that means being prepared for the depression th at would certainly follow. And if you wait too long to defla te, it can be too late. At that point, the run on the gold may have started . A short-term answer to the crisis is needed, and deflation wouldn’t wor k fast enough. The second alternative isn’t widely understood. The government simply defaults on its agreement to redeem dollars with a stated a mount of gold. Only it isn’t called a default; it’s calle d a devaluation . The government has promised, in effect, to pay out one ounce of gold for every 35 dollars turned in at the Treasury . Surveying the situation, the government sees that outstanding cla ims against the gold stock are perhaps six times as great as the gold su pply itself. And perhaps it calculates that about half of those claims are in the hands of people in a position to exercise them. So the government finally decides it has no alternative but to change the rules in the middle of the game. After having issued the dollars on the basis of a f ixed rate of exchange, it now changes the rate. It says it will no longer redeem one ounce of gold for every 35 dollars turned in. Now i t will pay out only one-half ounce for every 35 dollars. in other words, it will take 70 dollars, instead of 35, to claim one ounce. This is a devaluation : a repudiation of the government’s promise to honor its money substitutes at the stated rate o f exchange ."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 66 It’s important to recognize exactly what a devaluat ion is. It isn’t a mere adjustment of exchange rates; it isn’t a rai sing of the price of gold. It is the act of defaulting on a debt . It’s a bankrupt debtor deciding to pay off his debt s at 50 cents on the dollar (or any other percentage chosen). A 50% devaluation would mean changing the redemptio n rate from $35 per ounce to $70 per ounce, cutting the do llar’s redemption value in half. A 67% devaluation would mean changin g the redemption rate to $105 per ounce. A 100% devaluation would mean refusing to redeem an y gold at all. That’s what American citizens suffered in 1933 . Since then, no American has been legally permitted to own gold bul lion or any gold coins dated later than 1933. When a government devalues its currency, it seems t o have solved the problem. For devaluation will seem to ta ke the pressure off its gold supply for awhile. Inevitably, this encour ages more inflation; the consequences seem to have been eliminated, at least temporarily. Before the devaluation, there are many stop-gap mea sures a government may invoke, attempting to delay the inev itable. Most of these involve a false show of confidence in the fut ure of the gold supply, hoping to dissuade foreign creditors from c ollecting their gold. So the government ponders the dilemma of deflation or devaluation in trying to save its gold stock. And back on the other front, it’s the dilemma of runaway inflation or depression . Each of these problems becomes more and more aggrav ated, even while the government displays its most confide nt posture to the world. The bureaucrats and economists talk more and more a bout the “new age” of monetary matters, the “archaic relianc e on gold,” the gold speculators who are pictured as the villains, and o ther fictions that are intended to draw attention away from the real problem — the problem no one wants to end: inflation ."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 67 All of the tricks up the government’s sleeve have b een tried before and have failed to avert the inevitable.

How many times have you heard a statement like this : “We could never have another great depression in this country; the government now has the power to intervene and prevent such things from happening”? There was no shortage of governmental powers in 192 9. Still, there was a depression. It’s very instructive to re view the events of the 1920s and 1930s. They represent the classic example of the inflation-depression cycle we’ve been examining in this book. Anyone who believes that America of the 1920s was a n example of unregulated free enterprise hasn’t checked histo ry very closely. As noted before, I recommend Murray Rothbard’s outstan ding book, America’s Great Depression , as the most thorough economic history of the period 1921-1933. In Rothbard’s book, I counted 43 major federal acti vities in operation during the “Roaring Twenties.” Here are s ome of those programs: 1. The Federal Reserve System launched a full-scale bank inflation during the twenties. By controlling the r eserve requirements, it gave banks the lending power to create new paper mo ney. In addition, in 1923, the Reserve Banks began purchasing governm ent bonds in the open market to facilitate deficit spending and to a dd to the paper money supply. Prices could have gone down during the twenties; it was a period of high production. But it became apparent t hat the Federal Reserve Board was following a policy aimed at stabi lizing prices. Later, John Maynard Keynes hailed “the successful manageme nt of the dollar by the Federal Reserve Board from 1923 to 1928 . . .” "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 69 2. Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve extended credit directly to the Bank of England to offset the damag e done by the British inflation (just as it did during the sixties). Simi lar credits were extended to the central banks of Belgium, Poland, and Italy. 3. In August 1921, Congress authorized one billion dollars in credits to the War Finance Corporation, to be lent directly to farmers’ cooperatives and foreign importers of American farm goods. The purposes of the bill were to raise farm prices, pro vide cheap credit to farmers, and increase farm exports. There hasn’t be en a free market in agriculture since then. 4. During the First World War, the government seize d the railroads. They were finally returned to their owne rs in 1920. But in 1926, the Railway Labor Act was passed. This impose d upon the railroads the same sort of regulation that the Nati onal Labor Relations Act later brought to the rest of American industry. 5. Federal taxing policies were used to influence a ctivity in the stock market. In addition, the futures markets were regulated as a result of the Capper Grain Futures Act and the Futures Tra ding Act. 6. Business regulation started with th e signing of the Constitution and its provisions for tariffs and int erstate commerce laws. But it was greatly heightened by the anti-trust leg islation passed at the turn of the century, plus the establishment of the Federal Trade Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, etc . So please don’t delude yourself by looking to the g overnment to prevent the inevitable consequences of inflation. T hat’s asking the problem to provide the solution. There’s never been any shortage of governmental int ervention in the economy. But those who say, “We won’t have a re run of 1929 because the government has more power to intervene, ” are actually correct. The government does have more power; and so we won’t have a rerun of 1929. We’ll have something more severe. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 70 In general, American depressions have been getting steadily worse. As the government develops more “sophisticat ed” techniques for prolonging inflationary cycles, it causes more pain ful liquidation periods. INFLATION IN THE TWENTIES The seeds of the 1929 depression were planted in th e First World War and the inflation that accompanied it. Af ter the war, some of the paper money was cleared out, causing the rec ession of 1921. Then the state embarked upon a full-scale inflation ary cycle lasting through 1928, at which point money substitu tes outnumbered the real money by a ratio of eight to one. PAPER MONEY SUPPLY (December 31, 1928) Checking Account Deposits: $23.1 billion Currency in Circulation: 3.6 billion Total Money Substitutes: $26.7 billion Gold Stock (real money): $ 3.0 billion The big problem facing the money managers in late 1 928 was the heavy demand to redeem gold, coming from both A mericans and foreigners. The Federal Reserve Board chose to meet the issue by deflation, rather than by devaluation. The inflatio nary cycle ended and the inevitable miscalculations started coming to li ght. THE STOCK MARKET It’s important to realize that the stock market, li ke everything else in the economy, displays the effects of inflat ion. In fact, it’s a particularly sensitive indicator of paper money in circulation because of its liquidity, its constantly changing price struct ure."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 71 The stock market not only responds to inflation, it also benefits from it. It’s like the swimming pool industry. It’s an ideal investment receptacle for people who’ve been led to believe th ey have more money than they really do. In an inflationary cycle, many people who have no business investing think they have the funds to do so. This pushes stock prices up faster than the general price rise. Other people, viewing the stock market from outside , see it as a way to beat the depreciation of the dollar. They withdraw their savings from banks and buy stocks instead. The availability of margin credit adds to the numbe r of people betting on higher stock prices. But margin credit i sn’t the culprit of the stock market orgies. The villain is inflation. With out inflation, there wouldn’t be the feeling that higher prices are inev itable. People wouldn’t be so anxious to use margin if they though t there was a good chance the stock price might drop; for losses are g reater if the falling stock is margined. In addition, the paper money needed for margin loan s wouldn’t be available without inflation. The new paper money flowing into the stock market b ids the prices of stocks well beyond the levels justified b y any prosperity the companies involved are experiencing. So we see stoc ks selling at 30 to 100 times their earning values. At that point, the stock market moves by psychology rather than fundamentals. It’s no longer a question of what a p articular company is likely to do in the future. The question is: what w ill other speculators think the stock of that company will do? Chartists take over the market, looking for statist ical trends, “break-outs,” and other phenomena of mass psychology . The real fundamentals are ignored: supply and demand, compan y profits, markets, management, etc. But when the inflation ends, the stock market begin s to drop — inevitably . It has to drop because there’s no longer enough paper mon ey to support the higher price level."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 72 All during 1929, people in the stock market fought to push the market to higher levels. They succeeded temporarily , despite the deflation beginning around them. But the break had to come. By October, the point had been reached where it was li terally impossible to support the old price levels; the paper money just didn’t exist any more. The panic on October 29 wasn’t the cause of the dep ression, nor even the beginning of it. It was simply the irrefut able signal that there was a depression in progress — that the dream world had ended. The price was about to be paid for years of tinkering w ith the money supply. All speculative orgies are the result of inflation. Neither stock booms nor land booms could be sustained without inf lation. There just aren’t the resources available for people to buy-at -any-price unless inflation is pouring paper money into the economy. And the booms always collapse when the inflation ends. THE DEPRESSION BEGINS Surprisingly, once the inflationary cycle ends, the re doesn’t have to be widespread misery. The greatest losers will b e the businessmen who have large sums of capital tied up in productio n facilities and inventories that aren’t needed. With the inflation over, prices and wages will drop to whatever realistic points are required to get things moving again. Unwanted inventories will move at some price; and workers can be employed at some wage. No matter what the state of the economy, the re are an infinite number of unsatisfied human desires; thus, there’s always a market for someone to work to satisfy them. But what distinguishes a painful depression from a mild recession is the inability to get it over with. If the government has enough control over the economy, it usually will us e that power to prevent wages and prices from falling to their natural lev els. For some strange reason, high prices and high wages are assu med to be symptoms of a healthy economy — whereas they are only sympto ms of inflation. "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 73 And so everything is done to hold the price level u p, even though it isn’t possible to trade at those higher p rices. And, in the process, the economy comes to a dead stop. You can’ t have a world of high price levels when the paper money needed to su pport those levels is no longer there. The 1929 depression evoked the ultimate in governme ntal interference. Herbert Hoover has been characterized so often as a “do nothing” President and the symbol of the “rugged in dividualist.” But that isn’t true. He reacted to the depression by ca lling for a fantastic program to keep wages and prices high, and to preve nt the liquidation of mistakes. He vowed to reverse all previous governmental polic ies in fighting this depression. And he did. In the proces s, he succeeded in keeping the economy immobilized. When Franklin Roosevelt ran against Hoover in 1932, he castigated the President for his big-government tec hniques. He promised to cut the size of government and to let f ree enterprise make its way out of the depression unhampered. Naturally, that never happened. Politicians only ca ll for the reduction of powers they don’t hold themselves. Gov ernors, in general, are for states’ “rights.” Presidents are for federa l “rights.” If you want to change a governor’s attitude toward federal powe r, make him President. Roosevelt decided on a different policy from that p ursued by Hoover, however. He was anxious to get the engine o f inflation going again. But there was still that strain on the gold stock. So he removed the pressure by prohibiting Americans from owning gold (a 100% devaluation), and then devalued the dollar by 41% for foreigners. This gave him clear sailing to inflate with a venge ance. And he did. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 74 But he continued to force wage and price levels as high as possible, and they managed to stay ahead of the inf lationary push. So nothing happened. At the end of the thirties, there was still no improvement. And by that time, the economy was tied up in red tape. Finally, the preparation for war created an all-out inflation that broke the price-fixing logjam, and things began to move. Since then, we’ve been on one long inflationary spr ee. Each attempt to slow down the cycle has been met with a recession and a quick return to more inflation. The mistakes being piled up are enormous; and the problem has reached far greater d imensions than those that existed in 1929. The next time you read that we’re in the longest su stained “boom” in American history, you must remind yourself that, unfortunately, this means we’re awaiting the worst depression yet. The boom is unreal; but that doesn’t mean that all the prosperity is. America’s great productive strength has grown s teadily since the industrial revolution. It’s the growth in technical proficiency that has brought us prosperity. That growth is the only mean ingful kind of progress in the real world. To whatever extent ther e is inflation, to that extent the prosperity is diminished . How can one believe that the hundreds of billions o f dollars spent on wars and foreign aid and welfare can possi bly produce prosperity? That capital and energy and time could have gone into building things that actually improved our standard of living. Instead, the resources have been diverted into non-productiv e enterprises that reduced what we’d have had otherwise. It staggers the mind to wonder what we’d be enjoyi ng today if we hadn’t lost so much of our productivity to wasteful endeavors encouraged by the inflationary cycle. How far has that cycle gone? Here is the scorecard : "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 75 PAPER MONEY SUPPLY 7 (December 30, 1970) Checking Account Deposits: $211.1 billion Currency in Circulation: 48.9 billion Total Money Substitutes: 260.0 billion Gold Stock (real money): $11.1 billion The inflationary ratio was eight to one in 1928. No w it’s 25 to one. The money substitutes are 25 times the gold st ock backing them up. These are mere figures and I know of no magic formu la that attaches any particular significance to any particu lar ratio. But since 1966 the ratio has changed its direction. Even the slight decrease in the ratio in 1970 was due more than anything else to a slight increase in the gold supply. WILL THE GOVERNMENT SAVE US? We still hear over and over again that there could never be another depression because the government has the p ower to prevent it. But how can the government prevent it? In the first place, as we’ve seen, the government is the problem. Depressions aren’t caused by stock market speculati on, by unregulated free enterprise, by gold speculators, b y greedy profiteers, by shortages of demand, by capitalism, nor by lack of confidence. Depressions are caused by the government’s inflatio nary printing of paper money .   7 Source: Federal Reserve statistical release, Assets & Liabilities of all Commercial Banks in the U.S., January 12, 1971. Figure for checking account deposits includes U.S. Government deposits and all other demand deposits ( but not including deposits of other banks). "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 76 Secondly, even if the government did have the power to stop a depression, how could anyone be willing to put his faith in the government’s ability to use it wisely? This is the same government that has promised since 1964 to put an early end to the Vietnam war. This is the govern ment that solved our financial problems by removing the gold reserve req uirements for paper money and bank deposits. This is the government that today, while the econom y is already dizzy from deficit spending, is toying with more am bitious programs for outer space and free medical care for everyone. Even if the government did have the power to preve nt depressions, who could believe that every one of the two million bureaucrats who have anything to do with the problem will handle hi s role wisely? Is that where you want to put your faith? How does the government plan to deal with runaway inflation? No one has suggested putting an end to the inflationar y printing of paper money. Instead, all the discussions revolve around wage and price controls. That will just make matters worse. There’ s no way to control every wage and price. So, with the real inflation contin uing unchecked, the prices of all un controlled products and services will continue to g o up. That makes it unprofitable for individuals whose i ncome is controlled to continue selling their products and s ervices at the controlled prices. So they quit producing and treme ndous shortages result. And I’m sure that while that’s happening, there’ll be plenty of spokesmen to tell us how capably the government can control the economy. The fact is that the government can’t control the economy. Such a thing is a literal impossibility. Whenever it tries , it only makes matters worse. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 77 There’s no way the government can repeal the natur al law that you’ll only produce or exchange when you believe it will lead to something you want. And yet, every governmental eco nomic rule is an attempt to repeal that law — so every interference with the market fails to fulfill the “noble” purpose that was intended. Some people believe that an end to the war in Viet nam would save the economy. I don’t. It’s true that giving those b illions of war dollars back to the people to spend for themselves would he lp considerably — but even that wouldn’t be enough to reverse the his tory of the past thirty years. And it’s foolish to think that the money actually w ould be returned to the people in the form of tax relief or an end to deficit spending. It’s almost inevitable that the money wou ld be kept in Washington to be spent on every conceivable scheme the frustrated politicians can dream up. Big government always goes on unchecked. The end of the Korean war had no effect whatsoever upon the growth of government. Neither will an end to the war in Vietnam — if and when it ever happens. And don’t be naive enough to think that a change of administration would make any difference. Since the first world war, not one president has done anything to reverse the trend. Each one has been a slave to the merry-go-round he inherited. So how could we possibly believe the government wil l be our salvation? It’s the government that put us in this mess — and it’s the government that aggravates it daily. Economic cycles are a fact of life. And they’ll con tinue to be so — as long as most people believe governments are ca pable of doing for them what they’re unwilling to do for themselves. And we’re rapidly approaching the crisis point of t his economic cycle. There’s no way it can be prevented — althoug h it may be delayed and aggravated by further governmental sche mes. But there’s no way the clichés we continually hear can solve th e problem."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Harry Browne/MONEY 78 We’re told that all we need is confidence. But conf idence in what? Confidence that the immutable laws of economi cs have been repealed? Confidence that the world is going to sta rt spinning in the opposite direction from now on? Confidence that act s no longer have consequences? Can a man falling from a 30-story window, pulled to ward the ground by gravity, solve his problem with confidenc e? We’re told that we don’t need gold. “After all, the dollar is backed by the tremendous productive capacity of the nation.” That has a nice ring to it — until you examine it a little m ore closely. For what’s being said is that the government apparently has th e right to confiscate your production to back up its currency. The currency and the economy are two different thin gs. The government is wholly responsible for the currency i t issues. We, as individual human beings, are responsible for our ow n productivity. If you’d like to pledge your wealth, your resources, a nd your production as the backing for the government’s currency, you’r e welcome to. But I find the idea less than appealing. Money is a commodity that’s accepted in exchange. I t’s not a hope, not an abstraction, not a measure of producti on, not a short-term note. It’s a commodity that individual human beings are willing to hold while waiting to make purchases. No one will produce or exchange unless he believes it will lead ultimately to something he wants . You can’t impose a valueless money syst em upon people and expect that there won’t be reactions. Gold and silv er evolved as money commodities out of billions and billions of human e xchanges. They won’t be superseded within our lifetimes. Governmen ts can reject them, but individuals will continue to use them.

When Harry Browne entered the investment world in t he 1960s he set out to understand it all.

The best way is to set up your own investment Perma nent Portfolio. Within one day of doing so, you can have a safe por tfolio that you’ll never have to tinker with again. It's called a Perm anent Portfolio because once you set it up, you don't have to conti nually reevaluate it, alter it, or even think about it. And it doesn't ma tter whether next year brings prosperity, inflation, recession, or even a depression; you'll know you're safe - no matter what. Fail-Safe Investing , a short book by Harry Browne, shows you how to set up a Permanent Portfolio. It can be read in one to two hours. And it tells you everything you need to know to set up you r own investment portfolio - including sources for obtaining the inv estments. And no matter how much or little your investment ex perience, this book will show you how to handle your investments with m inimum effort and no worry, and yet make sure your wealth (howeve r large or small) is safe and growing. Written in Harry Browne's pate nted easy-to-follow style, sprinkled with his good humor, and with ever y detail covered, you'll never need another investment book.

In Part I, you will look at the 17 rules. Since mos t of them are largely self-evident, they require very few words to explai n. You can read through all the rules in 60 minutes or less. Part II provides background information and some no t-so-obvious examples of heeding or ignoring each rule. While the rules are largely warnings to exercise pr udence, they won't stop you from making profits. They even leave room for trying to strike it rich with part of your money, if that's what you want to do. But their first job is to keep you from making any mistake th at could be financially fatal. Investing doesn't have to be difficult, dangerous, complicated, or mysterious. It demands only that you relax and keep your head, that you approach the investment world in the same way you'v e handled the rest of your life - even if everyone you know chooses no t to.
