Over the years he purchased numerous quotation books and CDs, compiled file folders full of interesting quot es, and collected quotes in various category files on his computer. This book contains 2,048 quo tes mostly concerning liberty, government, political parties, and methods of selling the ideas of liberty. Surprisingly, none are by Harry Browne! Rather this is a collection of over two tho usand pithy libertarian quotations and comments, mostly by famous people, that will help y ou sell libertarian ideas to others. (Sources that include vital statistics [e.g. B. 1915 or 1915 -1987] were generally from The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations , 1993 edition, part of Microsoft Bookshelf.) Harry started collecting the quotes in this book during the 1990's, and they've been sorted by topics -- all with their original sources given whe n available. There are, of course, quotes by famous philosophers, politicians, writers, and scho lars; and there's even a quote or two from the Bible. But there are also quotes by lesser known so urces that were of particular interest to Harry such as operettas, television shows, movies, speech es, etc. Even more surprising, this book includes quotes from conversations Harry had with f riends, letters from admirers, emails from associates, and listeners to his radio shows. He ev en quotes a nurse in the neurology unit of Vanderbilt University Medical Center where he spent so much time the last year of his life. When Harry was the 1996 and 2000 Libertarian Par ty Presidential candidate he wrote, committed to memory, and used hundreds of remarks a gain and again to convince listeners to embrace libertarian ideas. A couple of years later he organized his personally crafted short, powerful, thought-provoking, and highly quotable re marks or \"soundbites\" by topic for quick and easy reference. Then the Advocates for Self-Gov ernment published them in a book entitled, Liberty A to Z: 872 libertarian soundbites you can use right now! Harry hoped people would work the quotes into their conversations with frien ds and family, in speeches, in letters to editors ~ anywhere to open minds to embrace liberty. He had the same purpose in mind while collecting the quotes in this book. Those of you who knew Harry personally know that he was a humble man. It was one thing for him to put together a book of his soundbites fo r you to use to convince others to embrace libertarian ideas. But it would never occur to him to add his own quotes to a book of quotations by mostly famous people. But I'm not so humble! I t hink this collection would be incomplete without a Harry Browne quote, so I've selected two of my favorites and offered them at the end of the book. (So technically speaking there are 2,0 50 quotes in this book!) Quotes are generally meant to challenge, inspire , motivate, or offer advice. I hope you enjoy, and are inspired by, the over two thousand quotes H arry personally selected to share with you. As he often said, if you use these \"with a benevole nt attitude toward the people you encounter, you should be well-armed.\" I wish you the very best.

Passing laws to make abortion illegal would have a profound impact on the overall nature of health care while failing to substantiall y decrease the number of abortions performed. Though government spends billions each year to conduct the absurd War on Drugs, government storm troopers interdict — or seize — only about 5% of the illegal drugs that come across our borders. I’m afraid the same r atio would hold true if we made abortion illegal. We’d spend billions of dollars an d negatively impact millions of lives and all the while we’d fail to significantly reduce the number of abortions. And to enforce these laws, doctors — who are already fit -to-be-tied by government red tape and insurance company oversight — would be subjec ted to horrible invasions of their privacy — not to mention the privacy of their pat ients. Many doctors are already on the verge of throwing up their hands and walking off the job. I believe that within five years of beginning a War on Abortion, our government would have to draft doctors. They’d have to draft c ollege seniors, send them to medical school, then put them to work in government-run med ical clinics. No man or woman in his right mind would want to practice medicine in t he middle of a government War on Abortion. Geoff Braun Email message to Harry Browne, November 13, 1998. 2. Why do pro-lifers not speak out against the use of chemical weapons, napalm and napalm-like bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan? Why do p ro-lifers not condemn the use of depleted uranium weapons which will continue to def orm unborn Arab babies long after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are forgotten by A mericans? Shame on pro-lifers for allowing the pro-choice Left to claim these issues for themselves. What do we get in exchange for our support, anyway? Alberto Gonzales, who supported the \"right\" of underage girls to get abortions without their paren ts’ consent in Texas. Have you ever heard him criticize Roe vs. Wade as vocally as he d oes the Geneva Convention?

We’re still a country in which our poor wo uld qualify as middle class in many countries. We’re still a country in which one of th e big health problems is people eating too much.

Denson, page 334. Antitrust Laws 29. The truth is that the only kind of “monopoly” t hat can form in a free market is one based on offering better products at lower prices, since under a free market even monopolies must obey the law of supply and demand. Harmful, co ercive monopolies are the result, not of the operation of the free market, but of gov ernment regulations, subsidies, and privileges which close off entry to competitors. No business can outlaw its competitors — only the government can. “A Petition to Stop the Persecution of Microsof t” The Committee for the Moral Defense of Microsoft Online, May 20, 1998 30. Considerable research has unmasked antitrust as special interest regulation, more adept at artificially protecting inefficient firms’ profits than at ensuring consumer welfare. Inferior competitors too often realize antitrust gi ves them a second bite at the apple in the courtroom if they fail in the marketplace. And, unl ike those of the marketplace, government’s choices are binding upon all. Clyde Wayne Crews, Jr., Competitive Enterprise Institute “Does Luck or Talent Rule the High-Technology Ma rket?” Center-Right , March 30, 1998 31. It’s time to bone up on the economics of antitr ust. Or rather, the anti-economics of antitrust. The government is in no position to dete rmine what is or is not an efficient organization of industry, what is or is not a separ ate product, or to interfere in any way with the right of contract between producers and co nsumers. Ludwig von Mises Institute press release June 29, 1998 32. Anyone familiar with the history of antitrust l itigation will see an old theme: the companies that get the government’s shaft are the o nes that aggressively expand their product line in ways that please consumers.

The lesson is this: when disgruntled adversarie s gain access to the levers of power, market success, consumer service, and spectacular i nnovation are punishable crimes in the United States. Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. Referring to the Microsoft case “Enemy of the People,” op-ed article November 5, 1998 36. What can we expect in the future when, not if, government intervenes further? If you believe government will act fairly and wisely, not favoring one group vs. another, or if you believe government will be efficient and respon sive to feedback as it deals with computer industry issues, I have an old Ethernet br idge I’d like to sell you. No. We should expect a new pecking order, defined by the amount of political influence various companies have been able to buy. And who ca n afford the most influence? Which company is responding to the pressure brought upon it by drastically stepping up its lobbying efforts and political contributions? M icrosoft, of course. The folks who hate Microsoft, the 800-pound gorill a in a relatively free market, should be worrying about the future Microsoft, not four mo nths, but four years from now, the gorilla with so much political influence, so many s enators and representatives in its back pocket, that it’s practically untouchable. After al l, you don’t have to buy Windows 98, and many people won’t.

So what are the specific implications [of the M icrosoft decision] — both in the near future and down the road? First, as noted, we will see a long-term tendency to put more resources into the legal and “public relations” divisions than into engineering and research; this will affect not only Microsoft, but its rivals as well. Note that by pub lic relations, I do not mean sales and marketing, I mean politics. Goodwill advertising. P arties for congressional and White House staffs. Political contributions. Whatever the merits of the government’s case in the Microsoft suit, I have yet to meet anyone who belie ves that any of this would have happened had Gates spent $100 million on political influence including nights in the Lincoln Bedroom. Imagine Janet Reno insisting on pr osecution if the president told Justice to lay off. Imagine the president ignoring $100 million. Second, consumers will pay higher prices for softw are. This is inevitable because public relations and legal services are expensive . Third, venture capitalists will be more cautious. The wild days are over. This isn’t quite a direct result of the Microsoft decision, but certai nly the market slowdown that was a direct consequence had its influence. With less loo se money, what is left over is invested more carefully. Perhaps this is a good thing. On th e other hand, Yahoo!, Earthlink and many other success stories might not be possible in today’s climate. Jerry Pournelle “The Beginning of the Decline and Fall?” IntellectualCapital.com, June 15, 2000. 40. No matter how large a company, the capital mark ets and the rest of the economy arrayed against it are bigger and can appropriately discipl ine it.

It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan.

The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening.

I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to quest ion the wisdom of such an act. . . . During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first o n the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was com pletely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid sho cking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer m andatory as a measure to save American lives.

Norman Cousins, consultant during occupation of Japan The Pathology of Power , pages 70-71. 55. I proposed to Secretary [of the Navy James] For restal that the weapon should be demonstrated before it was used. Primarily it was b ecause it was clear to a number of people, myself among them, that the war was very ne arly over. The Japanese were nearly ready to capitulate . . . My proposal to the Secret ary was that the weapon should be demonstrated over some area accessible to Japanese observers and where its effects would be dramatic. I remember suggesting that a sat isfactory place for such a demonstration would be a large forest of cryptomeri a trees not far from Tokyo. The cryptomeria tree is the Japanese version of our red wood . . . I anticipated that a bomb detonated at a suitable height above such a forest . . . would lay the trees out in windrows from the center of the explosion in all directions as though they were matchsticks, and, of course, set them afire in the center. It seemed to me that a demonstration of this sort would prove to the Japanese that we could destroy a ny of their cities at will . . . Secretary Forrestal agreed wholeheartedly with the recommenda tion . . .

In their hubris, our internationalists cannot see the world as others see it or see themselves as others see them. What they see as rea sonable, Serbs view as intolerable, what they call stability, Kosovars reject as a perp etuation of injustice.

Prudential [banking] regulation was enshrined i n international trade through the 1988 Basle Committee Accord on capital adequacy standard s for G-10 banks, which mandated minimum levels of capital that banks must maintain as a buffer against ‘credit risk,’ or the risk that clients will fail to pay. . . . one m ust understand the political motivations for the agreement to understand the why , the when , and the how . As for the why , prudential regulation was needed primarily to com pensate for problems created by already existing regulation. Exceptional ly generous government deposit- insurance guarantees were responsible for major ban king disasters, particularly in the U.S. and Finland; banks in financial difficulty had been given massive incentives to roll the dice with depositor funds, for which the govern ment was wholly liable. Simply stated government insurance guarantees give banks an incen tive to operate with as little capital as possible. Rather than attempt the politically tr icky task of overhauling national deposit-insurance systems, national regulators foun d it easier just to collude among themselves to fix minimum capital requirements. As for the when , the timing largely reflects the rapidly growing c oncern in the mid-1980s with Japanese competition, the banking sector being just one example. The competitive success of Japanese banks prompted British and Amer ican authorities to push for an international agreement to raise capital standards, as this would have the explicit effect of slowing the expansion of large Japanese banks opera ting at relatively low capital levels."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 As for the how of capital regulation, the exclusive focus on cred it risk, with no concern for interest-rate risk, proved exceptionally conven ient for G-10 countries with large budget deficits. While the Accord treated commercia l loans as risky, and therefore requiring capital backing, government debt was trea ted as being completely riskless, therefore requiring no capital whatsoever. The effect was predictable. Between 1989 and 1992, U.S. commercial and industrial loans declined by $42 billion, to about $600 billio n. Over the same period, bank holdings of U.S. Government debt increased by nearly 50%, re aching the same level as the loan holdings. International prudential regulation appar ently exacerbated the U.S. recession, while simultaneously increasing the incentives for the U.S. government to continue its deficit-financed spending binge. Be on the lookout for more such regulation in the future. Benn Steil, “The New Rules of Trade” National Review , April 18, 1994, pages 41-43 64. To suppose that “wildcat” promises to pay money would circulate and be used among intelligent people, in these days of instantaneous communication, would be as unreasonable as to suppose that people have learned nothing during the past 50 years, and even if such a thing were possible, it is certa inly no part of the duty of government to protect a free people against their own lack of int elligent discrimination. Wildcat banking never existed because of freedom, but became possible only through and by the use of the law-making power of the state . Did anyone ever hear of dishonest banking being conducted without a charter from the state?. . . With freedom there would be bad banking, of course , but evils of that kind would soon be corrected and would be of small concern compared to the benefits to be derived under such conditions. Men of honesty and reputations acq uired by honest methods of banking would soon come to the front; no dishonest banker c ould long compete with a banker who was honest. Under present conditions there is no opportunity f or moral considerations to have any force; it is only necessary to make people believe that bankers comply with the law, thereby giving the dishonest banker an advantage ov er those who conduct their banks honestly and in strict accordance with sound bankin g principles.

America conservatism is merely the shadow that follows radicalism as it moves forward toward perdition. It remains behind it, but never retards it, and always advances near its leader. . . .

The t ug of war between conservatives and progressives can only affect the speed, not the dir ection, of contemporary developments.

David Frum The Weekly Standard , December 2, 1996; page 29 350. Might some difference in pay exist in a compet itive economy? Yes, indeed. The slogan “equal pay for equal work” is thrown around too cas ually. What is “equal work”? When employers hire workers, they are arranging for a st ream of labor services projecting into the future. Naturally, employers value reliability as well as productivity. They want not only talented workers, but also workers who will be on the job long-term. If experience shows that one group of workers is less likely to b e there long-term than another group, it stands to reason that the first group will command somewhat lower pay than the second. If the pay difference is outlawed, the group that w ould have been paid less will have a harder time finding jobs."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 Like it or not, women are more apt than men to dro p out of the work force to raise families.

Let’s say we had a law that said: “Marriages c ontracted under the age of 25 must be based on the grounds of love and no other reason.” It would be enforced with fines of $100,000. Is there any doubt where such a law would lead? Certainly not to more loving young couples. Everyone would wait until age 26 to get married. The advocates of such a law can protest that this is not what they have in mind. They can claim they were just trying to promote romance. But the legal logic says otherwise. The only way to enforce certain kinds of intentions is by mandating certain kinds of effects. It is anti-discrimination law, not quotas, that al lows the government to enforce multiculturism in every business in America. Busine ssmen pass over more qualified candidates for hiring and promotion because they fe ar the costs of lawsuits. What looks like a quota is actually defensive action against f ederal courts that like to count the numbers. Bean counting may be unfair and inefficien t, but is the only way that anybody has found to enforce the law. Ban every quota in the country, and business would still be subject to bankruptcy- threatening class-action suits. End every set-aside , and you still have whole housing complexes harassed for keeping out criminals. Aboli sh all affirmative action, and colleges will still have to recruit the intellectua lly challenged to avoid the appearance of discrimination. That’s why the central government needs to be stri pped of its power to determine if anyone is discriminating or giving preferences (or even what constitutes either).

The federal budget for the drug war in the fir st year of the new millennium is $17 billion. In 1972 when President Richard Nixon first called f or a “war against drugs,” the federal drug-law enforcement budget was about $101 million. It is difficult for most of us to comprehend what these numbers mean. But the true magnitude of cost can be understood if we consider that in 1972, the average monthly Social Security retirement check was $177. If Socia l Security benefits had increased at the same rate as drug-war spending, the monthly ben efits would now be $30,444 a month.

I was a policeman for 35 years of this century . As a beat officer in New York’s Harlem, and as police chief in Kansas City and San Jose, I caused many drug users to be locked up. I have come to believe that jailing people simp ly because they put certain chemicals into their bloodstream is a gross misuse of police and criminal law.

Joseph D.McNamara, retired police chief, San Jo se, CA “Drug Peace for a New Millennium?” The Orange County (CA) Register , July 24,1999 Commentary section, page 4. 417. Because drug transactions are consensual, the police do not have a victim, witnesses and physical evidence that helps them solve crimes like murder, assault, robbery, rape and burglary. And under the Fourth Amendment, the polic e, with few exceptions, are not allowed to search people or their homes without a w arrant. Yet, last year, state and local police in the United States made approximately 1,40 0,000 arrests for illegal possession of drugs. Overwhelmingly, these were minor arrests and rarely did they involve a court approved warrant. The inescapable conclusion is that in hundreds of thousands of cases police officers violated their oath to uphold the Constitution and often committed perjury so that the evidence would be admitted. The practice is so prev alent that the term “testilying” is frequently substituted in police jargon for “testif ying.” The injury that unlawful searches and perjury by the police does to the credibility o f our justice system is immeasurable.

There is no record of any one dying from marijuana or committing a murder under its effects. Any number o f scientific studies have indicated that in some cases it may be an effective medicine and it is certainly a less dangerous drug than alcohol. We would eliminate almost 700,00 0 arrests a year which would not only save money but also avoid ruining the lives of those arrested. In addition, our country should revert to the pre- Harrison Act principle that no one should be arrested if his/her only crime is putting certain chemicals into their bloodstream.

Greater harm is done by the drug trade than by the drugs themselves. Because the trade is illegal, dealers charge a premium to cover the risk of going to jail if they’re caught. This is generating billions of dollars, all in cash and all beyond the effective control of governments. It is corrupting our society. It is th e driving force of many of the gang wars and murders in our cities. It is the motivation for a disproportionate percen tage of income-generating crimes such as robbery, burglary, and theft committed by addict s looking for money to pay high drug prices.

The most fundamental concept of economics is t he law of demand, which says that consumers buy less when the price rises. Misunderst anding this basic rule, the drug warriors attempt to justify interdiction. They clai m drug consumption can be ended by cutting off supply, thereby causing a price increas e resulting in little or no demand. In other words, interdiction will cause prices to rise to such a high level that demand will cease. A little knowledge is very dangerous. In fact, the law of demand only applies to one product at a time. Our sorry experience shows that when one illicit commodity becomes too expensive, another is selected. A 1994 National Bureau of Economic Research study found that when the price of marijuana rises, youth drink more beer and that directly correlates with an increase in traffic fatalities. A National Institute of Justice study reported a p recipitous increase in the use of methamphetamine during 1985-86 after a crop destruc tion program eviscerated the marijuana supply in Hawaii. Making marijuana more d ifficult to obtain also causes an increase in cocaine consumption.

By the end of my tenure with the LAPD [Los Ang eles Police Department] I came to believe that marijuana — a drug I had never seen an yone overdose on or influence anyone to do anything more violent than attack a ba g of potato chips — should be legalized. I held a bifurcated stance toward illicit drugs — legalize pot but strictly enforce existing laws against the rest of the stuff. . . . As the ye ars passed, however, I saw a nation fighting harder, devoting more money and jailing in creasing numbers of individuals — all the while falling further behind in the war on drugs. The price of the drugs didn’t rise with increased interdiction, usage rates didn’t fall and the number of lives damaged or destroyed by chronic use, overdose and drug-related criminal activity mounted. No matter how much I dis liked the idea, I became convinced the United States should legalize illicit drugs. . . . I do not know whether legalizing drugs will increa se their popularity. But I suspect that if we approach legalization thoughtfully and pursue a sensible post-legalization strategy, then the drug rolls will not swell. They may in fac t decline. But even if more people do take drugs in the wake of legalization, we would li ve in a society where citizens suffer far less from the predatory crimes spawned by the i llicit drug trade.

Indeed, in several areas, reducing government spending and regulatory control s is likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and spur research and investment in “clea ner” technologies."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 A free-market “no regrets” policy would consist of the following three elements: 1) Removing regulatory barriers to innovation; 2) Elim inating subsidies to energy use; and 3) Deregulating energy-related markets. Each elemen t will produce tangible economic benefits by either reducing needless government spe nding or limiting regulatory burdens on the private sector. Each element will also remov e government-induced market distortions which can produce greater greenhouse ga s emissions. For example, most firms are constantly seeking to cut costs so as to increase profits. Energy use, in many sectors, is a substantial cost. So, when new facilities are built, and old facilities are upgraded, they typically use ene rgy more efficiently than before. Increasing energy productivity is one way for compa nies to cut costs and, incidentally, to reduce their emissions while maintaining, if not in creasing, their productive output. Environmental regulations, however, often get in t he way of these improvements. As a recent study by the Environmental Law Institute con cluded, “technology-based emission limits and discharge standards, which are embedded in most of our pollution laws, play a key role in discouraging innovation.

The United States began with a decentralized syste m of governance. The locus of power was not at the national level, but at the state and local levels. The Constitution delegated only a few defined powers to the national governmen t.

While state governments could be every bit as oppressive as the national government, at least the state jurisdictio ns were smaller and, if necessary, people could flee. . . .

And it is indeed a wonder to realize how great Athens became within a century after it had thrown off the tyranny established by Pisistratus. But it is even more extraordinary to note the greatness which Rome attained after she was free of her kings. The reason is easy to understand, for it is not the welfare of individual s, but the common welfare that makes cities great. And doubtless this common welfare can not be pursued except in republics because they undertake whatever action may be neede d to promote it. However harmful its pursuit may be to this or that individual, thos e who stand to gain are so numerous that they can pursue it in spite of the few who may be h armed. The contrary is true where there is a prince. In s uch a case the things which are of advantage to him more often than not are harmful to the city, and the things which are of advantage to the city are harmful to him. Thus, whe rever tyranny replaces freedom, the least that can happen is that the city will no long er increase in either power or wealth. Most often, indeed always, it will decline. And if by chance a very capable tyrant appears by whose courage and military skill the city’s terr itories are increased, it will not be a gain for the republic, but only for him, because he cannot advance any of those good and valiant citizens over whom he tyrannizes, for they will then become dangerous. It is no wonder then that the people of antiquity despised tyrants, loved living in freedom, and exalted the name of liberty. . . . It is also n o wonder that the people take extraordinary vengeance upon those who deprive them of their freedom. . . . So we see that a freedom that has been lost is avenged with f ar more fury than one that has only been threatened.

One do es not stand against liberty, but for something else, something that, as it turns out, ca n only be achieved at the expense of liberty. This something else is the \"higher good.\" Every tyranny in history has been justified in the name of the higher good. What constitutes the higher good changes from place to p lace and time to time, and depends on who you talk to. It might be social justice, tradit ional values, national greatness, or anything else. But whatever it is, the basic patter n is always the same: “ Freedom is important, but there are other things that are more important. These other things constitute the higher good. When a conflict arises, it is necessary and appropriate to sacrifice freedom in the name of the higher good. ” Most political discourse is little more than quibb ling over what constitutes the higher good, and what specific freedoms should be sacrific ed accordingly. Most political activism is nothing but an attempt to define the gr ounds on which to justify persecution. Freedom's Nest rejects this argument regardless of what is passed off as the higher good, and asserts the following: Individual liberty is itself the highest possible social good. There can be no moral justification for persecutio n.

Investors will, on occasion, make misjudgments , and borrowers will, at times, misread their capabilities to service debt. When market pri ces and interest rates adjust promptly to evidence of such mistakes, the consequences of t he mistakes are generally contained and, thus, rarely cumulate to pose significant syst emic risk. There was some evidence of that process working in the latter part of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century when internatio nal capital flows were largely uninhibited. Losses, however, in an environment whe re gold standard rules were tight and liquidity constrained, were quickly reflected i n rapid increases in interest rates and the cost of capital generally. This tended to delim it the misuse of capital and its consequences. Imbalances were generally aborted bef ore they got out of hand. But following World War I such tight restraints on econ omies were seen as too inflexible to meet the economic policy goals of the twentieth cen tury. . . . In the late twentieth century, however, fiat curre ncy regimes have replaced the rigid automaticity of the gold standard in its heyday. Mo re elastic currencies and markets, arguably, are now less sensitive to and, hence, slo wer to contain the misallocation of capital.

From the 1930s to the 1990s, American public l ife has been dominated by the notion that government is a magical entity that can take money from all of us and give back more than it took, making us all richer in the process.

This belief underlies all sorts of government poli cy, from subsidies to farmers to “free” college tuition, from Social Security to deficit sp ending to the Great Society to military adventures overseas. This faith dominated American political culture while most of us grew up — dominated so powerfully and so totally th at it needed no name. It just passed as common belief.

I believe our present predicament exists becau se we have gradually developed governmental institutions in which the people effec tively have no voice. A recent study by James Payne brought this home to me very clearly . Examining fourteen different government hearings dealing with spending issues, P ayne found that “1,014 witnesses appeared in favor of the spending. Only 7 could be classified as opponents. In other words, pro-spending witnesses outnumbered anti-spen ding witnesses 145 to 1.” Striking as that is, an even more important finding was that “of the 1,060 witnesses who appeared, 47% were federal administrators, and anot her 10% were state and local officials. An additional 6% were congressmen themse lves.” Thus 63% of the witnesses in favor of the spending were from government. They were telling us that they should spend our money, I won’t say for their benefit but for what they believed, or said they believed, was our benefit. Payne added, “ Overwhelmingly, Congress’s views on spending programs are shaped by government officials themsel ves.” What is true of spending proposals is equally true of other governmental mea sures: sugar quotas, the tax exemption of medical care provided by employers, th e agricultural subsidies, and so on down the line.

If anything, for the past twenty years, deficits and interest rates have run in opposite di rections. How can this seeming paradox be explained?

Liberal pundits will tell you that the problem is that the public wants the goodies that government supposedly provides but is too stingy to pay for them. If only, liberals say, we could get those greedy, stingy people to provide us with more taxes, we could solve all these problems. They may be partly right, but o nly partly. For example, that explanation cannot be the reason we have agricultural subsidies. Do the people of this country really want to pay farme rs to grow goods and throw them away or give them away at low prices abroad? To say that the public wants the goodies that government supplies may be true for Medicare and Me dicaid but surely not for agricultural subsidies or restrictions on the impor t of Japanese cars, restrictions that raised by perhaps $2,000 or so the cost of a car to a member of the public and, incidentally, did not prevent the decline of the U. S. auto industry. It is not true for sugar import quotas. If you could have a public vote on w hether consumers want to pay twice the world price for sugar, do you think that there would be an overwhelming vote saying yes? On the contrary, when people have the opportunity to vote on those issues, they overwhelmingly vote the other way. The public at la rge thinks that government is too big. People know they are not getting their money’s worth for the taxes they pay. In California, where I live and where propositions can be put on the ballot so that you can have direct democracy, the people voted for Proposi tion 13, which started the tax revolt.

Even in the wildest mining towns of the Old We st, however, the murder rate was less than in contemporary Washington, D.C., with its str ict gun-control laws.

In many cases simply displaying the firearm is eno ugh to end a criminal’s attack. Although the gun has been “used,” no shots are fire d. There are no multi-victim massacres. No innocent children shot. No new orphan s or blood and bodies. Instead a woman thwarts a rapist or a man prevents a massacre by possessing a firearm. Ever hear about these cases? Of course not. These stories are not titillating enough to make the evening news. And there is no way the medi a will report honestly on the 2.5 million annual defensive uses of firearms by law-ab iding citizens.

MADD has been effective because the organization went after the people doing harm not the instruments of their dest ruction. MADD didn't demand more alcohol controls, nor did it seek to get rid of cars, which, incidentally, kill far more children each year than guns do. (In 1998, 2,600 children ages 1-14 died in car accidents, while 110 died from gun accidents.) MADD went after the root of the problem — the drunken driver. Kathleen Parker “Gun control?

Every man of public experience knows how powe rful and seductive precedent is as an argument in the interpretation of laws and of const itutional provisions, or in justification of governmental practices. When a thing, no matter how questionable, has once been done by the government, and approved, or even acqui esced in, by the people, that act will surely be used as a justification of its being done again. In nothing is the authority of precedent more dangerous than in defending usurpati ons of governmental power. And it is remarkable how prone the public mind is, especia lly under the influence of party spirit, to accept precedent as a warrant for such usurpatio ns, which, judged upon their own merits, would be sternly condemned. And every such precedent is apt to bring forth a worse one. It is in this way that the most indispen sable bulwarks of free government, and of public peace and security may be undermined.

He’s told by pundits that the national soul resides in his ve ry person. He’s convinced that he is “leader of the free world,” even while the governme nt he heads conspires every day to take away freedom. He knows that “history” is kinde st to presidents who start wars, centralize the economy, and generally run roughshod over the democratic process, so he aspires to be like them. The presidency is the head of a vast bureaucratic empire with trillions of dollars to pass out. And we are surprised when the political appoin tees get entangled in conspiracy and graft? That’s what politics is about. That’s what p ower is about. That’s what the presidency is about. The office obeys no rule of law. The presidency al lows a person to order up bombings on foreign medicine factories on a whim. Worse, it gra nts the power to issue executive orders that contradict the Constitution, to bail ou t foreign governments it likes and impose sanctions on those it doesn’t. It’s the offi ce that permits one man to H-bomb the world, if he’s so inclined. No one should have such power, especially not in a country conceived in liberty. Llewellyn H.

Rulers certainly influence how the inhabitant s of a country go about their daily routines, and can become the determining factor in most peoples’ lives when there’s a war or other all-consuming political crisis. But a country is run by those who go to work, do their jobs, create goods, services and profits, create homes for their families and support networks for their loved ones, independentl y of what a president does — independently, even, of whether there is a presiden t at all.

Eric Margolis “Bomb The Usual Iraqis,” The Toronto Star , December 17, 1998. 1420. [Constitutional scholar Raoul] Berger’s gener al conclusion, then, is that the Constitution envisions a President who a) receives ambassadors, b) appoints heads of departments (to be approved by the Senate), c) commands the armed f orces once a war has been declared or enemy armies actually invade US territory, d) “m akes treaties” which have no force unless ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, and e) sees that the laws are “faithfully executed.” Thus the President is the head beadle, the top jan itor, the chief administrator, a host at gatherings of foreign potentates, and the leader of all those “subaltern clerks” that Ludwig von Mises used to write about. It is hard to wrench from this short list of duties any believable doctrine of inherent Presidential po wer. That such a doctrine exists and has swept the fiel d bears witness to the bad faith and ambition of those who can’t achieve their goals by ordinary constitutional means and therefore prefer the backing of an elected monarch (responsible to “everyone” and therefore to no one) and the Supreme Court sitting as a French Revolutionary sovereign Convention with a license to do good.

In the long r un, the world is going to have the best, and any difference in race, religion, or previous h istory will not long keep the world from what it wants. I think that the whole future of my race hinges on the question as to whether or not it can make itself of such indispens able value that the people in the town and the state where we reside will feel that our pr esence is necessary to the happiness and well-being of the community. No man who continues t o add something to the material, intellectual, and moral well-being of the place in which he lives is long left without proper reward.

There is nothing inherently virtuous about re cycling, anymore than saving string is inherently virtuous. We should recycle only if recy cling allows more to be produced than the use of new materials would. If that’s the case, there will be a demand for recycled materials — and someone will be eager to pay to get them. But if we have to be forced or urged to recycle, with no remuneration for doing so , it must be that the people using the recycled materials want to get something for nothin g. Source unknown. 1515. One argument for recycling is that we are run ning out of landfill space. A “public service” advertisement on Nickelodeon shows images of a city being buried in its own trash. This is typical of what passes for environme ntal education. Just as hysterical are American Education Publishing’s “Comprehensive Curr iculum” series and 50 Simple Things Kids Can Do To Save the Earth . In fact, there is no landfill shortage. If all the solid waste for the next thousand years were put into a single space, it would take up 44 m iles of landfill, a mere .01% of the U.S. land space. Roy E. Cordato “Don’t Recycle: Throw It Away!” The Free Market Newsletter Ludwig von Mises Institute, December 1999. 1516. How about the claim that recycling paper save s trees? Every school kid knows it does. Paper is made from trees. Why not make new paper fr om old paper and save more trees from being cut down? Actually, that doesn’t work. Supply meets demand. If tomorrow we suddenly stopped making bread from wheat, there would be less wheat in the world one year from now. The supply would have fallen drastically. If everyo ne stopped eating chicken, the chicken population would not grow but fall. The same logic applies to the relationship between paper and trees. If we stopped using paper, there would be fewer trees planted. In the p aper industry, 87% of the trees used are planted to produce paper. For every 13 trees “s aved” by recycling, 87 will never get planted. It is because of the demand for paper that the number of trees has been increasing in this country for the last fifty years . The lesson is this: if your goal is to maximize the number of trees, don’t recycle."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":" 336 Roy E.

This is interesting, especially when we compare it to the tobacco war that is being fought simultaneously.

The idea that the First Amendment permits pun ishment for ideas that are ‘offensive’ to the particular judge or jury sitting in judgment is astounding. No greater leveler of speech or literature has ever been designed. To give the p ower of the censor, as we do today, is to make a sharp and radical break with the traditio ns of a free society. The First Amendment was not fashioned as a vehicle for dispensing tranquilizers to the people. Its prime function was to keep debate open to “offensive” as well as to “staid” people. The tendency throughout history has been to subdue the individual and to exalt the power of government. The use of the standard “offensive” gives authority to government that cuts the very vitals out of the First Amendment. As is intimated by the Court’s opinion, the materi als before us may be garbage. But so is much of what is said in political campaigns, in the daily press, on TV, or over the radio. By reason of the First Amendment — and solely becau se of it — speakers and publishers have not been threatened or subdued because their t houghts and ideas may be “offensive” to some. . . . But our society — unlike most in the world — presupposes that freedom and liberty are in a frame of reference that makes the individual, not government, the keeper of his tastes, beliefs, and ideas.

A voucher is a wealth-transfer scheme that ta kes money from the haves and gives it to the have-nots — by the force of taxation. The name for that is welfare. A free lunch is welfare.

Not simply in its financial aid office, but throughout the institutio n. The danger of vouchers is that he who pays the pip er calls the tune and while one can argue that people are simply being allowed to keep or spend their own money, the reality is that the federal government will claim that you are subject to federal public policy standards if you accept a federal voucher as an ins titution. I think it’s suicidal for Christian schools, private schools, to accept vouch ers. The risk of bringing through the back door, the same rules, conditions, and problems into the Christian or private school that caused one to flee the public school in the fi rst place, should be a paramount consideration in considering the perilous temptatio n posed by vouchers.

Aggressive nationalism is the necessary deriv ative of the policies of interventionism and national planning. While laissez-faire eliminates t he causes of international conflict, government interference with business and socialism create conflicts for which no peaceful solution can be found. While under free tr ade and freedom of migration, no individual is concerned about the territorial size of his country, under the protective measures of economic nationalism nearly every citiz en has a substantial interest in these territorial issues. The enlargement of the territor y subject to the sovereignty of his own government means material improvement for him or at least relief from restrictions which a foreign government has imposed upon his wel l-being. What has transformed the limited war between royal armies to total war, the clash between peoples, is not technologies of military art, but the substitution of the welfare state for the laissez-faire principle.

War is never there to be easily defended, but even so, there is a visceral difference between a combat devoted uniquely to bombing, and p articipation in a ground war. Ground war is always cruel beyond human comprehensi on, but there are occasional examples of heroism or sacrifice, and since both of the adversaries lose young men, there is, with all else, a hint of shared sorrow on both sides. Over the years and decades, that can even permit a reconciliation. Bombing, however, is oppression. If the bombing is done with the notion that our own blood is not to be shed, it is obscene.

I think most historians will agree that the p art played by impulses of selfish, individual aggression in the holocausts of history was small; first and foremost, the slaughter was meant as an offering to the gods, to king and count ry, or the future happiness of mankind. The crimes of Caligula shrink to insignificance com pared to the havoc wrought by Torquemada. The number of victims of robbers, highw aymen, rapists, gangsters and other criminals at any period of history is negligi ble compared to the massive numbers of those cheerfully slain in the name of the true reli gion, just policy, or correct ideology. Arthur Koestler Quoted by Freedom’s Nest. 1904.

Arthur Koestler Quoted by Freedom’s Nest. 1905. One of the most fashionable notions of our ti mes is that social problems like poverty and oppression breed wars.

Of all the enemies to liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the pa rent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, and debts, and taxes a re the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, t oo, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds , are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The Constitution expressly and exclusively vests i n the Legislature the power of declaring a state of war [and] the power of raising armies. A delegation of such powers [to the president] wou ld have struck, not only at the fabric of our Constitution, but at the foundation of all w ell organized and well checked governments. The separation of the power of declari ng war from that of conducting it, is wisely contrived to exclude the danger of its being declared for the sake of its being conducted.

Nostalgia for World War II springs from the y earning to be able to utter simplistic propaganda with a straight face. Bush can do it, an d he strikes a chord with people who acclaim “moral clarity” and reject what they term “ moral equivalence.” War demands this mindset, in which one’s own side represents pu re goodness and the enemy pure evil, beyond human sympathy. In wartime, hatred becomes mandatory; neutrality i s impermissible, a cowardly refusal to choose between good and evil.

Despotism delights in war. It is its element.

We hear much of necessary wars; but it is cer tainly true, that a real, absolute, unavoidable necessity for war, such as alone can re nder it just, has seldom occurred in the history of man. The pride, the wanton cruelty o f absolute princes, caring nothing for human life, have in all ages, without the least nec essity, involved the world in war; and therefore it is the common cause of all mankind to abolish absolute power; and to discourage, by every lawful means, the spirit that leads to any degree of it. No individual, however good, is fit to be trusted with so dangerou s a deposit. His goodness may be corrupted by the magnitude of the trust; and it is the nature of power, uncontrolled by fear or law, to vitiate the best dispositions.

Practically speaking, the task of deciding th e justice or injustice of any particular war devolves upon the conscience of the individual cons cript or soldier. It is his conscientious duty to decide, as a matter of concre te fact, whether any particular war is aggressive or defensive, and, if defensive, whether it is justified or unjustified, and, in consequence, whether he is free or obliged or forbi dden to participate formally in it, whether he is free or obliged or forbidden to be a conscientious objector.

I’m not sure that ‘round-the-clock bombing raids on Germany’s civilian population was the righ t answer. I’m certainly not proud of it, nor do I try to justify it. I mean, the Holocau st certainly was one of the most heinous crimes against humanity committed in this century, but we killed upwards of 2 million people with our bombing raids in North Vietnam just a couple of years ago, as many or more native Americans in the century past. And our esteemed and peace-loving allies, the English, exterminated about as many Irish. Our Soviet allies proved to be just as brutal as the Nazis. If we must engage in what we abhor to achieve our ends, I think we need to re-evaluate our goals. Sean Cavanaugh CompuServe, June 18, 1995"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":" 449 2041. When we consider the 56 million people — mo st of them civilians — who died during the Second World War, we of a younger generation ca n understand why those who watched their comrades die in it were obliged to te ll themselves not only that it was an inevitable conflict, but that it was the only noble way of defeating an evil tyranny. A.N. Wilson “Was the Second World War worth 56 million lives ?” The Independent (United Kingdom), April 25, 1999 2042. The one fact about Hitler which nobody believ ed during the Second World War was that he meant what he said about the Jews. The British F oreign Office and the BBC consistently refused to believe the stories of exte rmination as they began to come through from Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and elsewhere in the middle years of the war. Only in 1945 when people watched the newsreels of Belsen di d the extent of the Nazi atrocities become clear. And of course — another intolerable thought — this slaughter only began after the outbreak of war. Could it be — in tolerable question — that it was the cover of war alone which made the massacres possibl e? A.N. Wilson “Was the Second World War worth 56 million lives ?” The Independent (United Kingdom), April 25, 1999 2043. If the Second World War had never been fought , not only would those 56 million, most of them, have died in their beds; not only would th e beautiful cities of France, Germany, Italy and Poland, which were destroyed, have remain ed intact, but Hitler and his crazy regime would almost certainly have been overthrown in the fullness of time by his own people. A.N. Wilson “Was the Second World War worth 56 million lives ?” The Independent (United Kingdom), April 25, 1999 2044. We Americans have the dangerous tendency in o ur international thinking to take a holier- than-thou attitude toward other nations. We conside r ourselves to be more noble and decent than other peoples, and consequently in a be tter position to decide what is right and wrong in the world. What kind of war do civilia ns suppose we fought, anyway? We shot prisoners in cold blood, wiped out hospitals, strafed lifeboats, killed or mistreated enemy civilians, finished off the enemy wounded, to ssed the dying into a hole with the dead, and in the Pacific boiled the flesh off enemy skulls to make table ornaments for sweethearts, or carved their bones into letter open ers. We topped off our saturation bombing and burning of enemy civilians by dropping atomic bombs on two nearly defenseless cities, thereby setting an all-time rec ord for instantaneous mass slaughter.

Our triumphs did not serve as evidence that democracy is best for the world, any more than Russian victories proved that communism is an ideal system for all mankind. Edgar L. Jones “One War Is Enough” The Atlantic Monthly , February 1946. 2046. The use of this barbarous weapon [the atomic bomb] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. . . . My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make wars in that fashion , and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children. Admiral William D. Leahy President Harry S. Truman’s Chief of Staff Quoted by Ralph Raico “Hiroshima & Nagasaki” Future of Freedom Foundation, June 20, 2001. 2047. If the Germans had dropped atomic bombs on ci ties instead of us, we would have defined the dropping of atomic bombs on cities as a war cri me, and we would have sentenced the Germans who were guilty of this crime to death at N uremberg and hanged them.
