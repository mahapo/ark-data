He recounts the aggressive ac ts of the foreign country’s dictator and says there is evidence of mo re aggressions to come. • The President says America must go to war to protec t itself. But he promises that the world will be a better place, a s afer place, a freer and more democratic place when the war is over. • The President promises to liberate the people in th e enemy country from their evil dictator. • America goes to war, but the war drags on longer th an expected. American casualties and the financial cost exceed prewar est imates. • Civil liberties are curtailed. The government invad es privacy, imprisons Americans, and generally ignores the Bill of Rights . • Eventually the war ends. But, except for victory it self, no prewar promise has been fulfilled. The oppressed people haven’t fo und freedom; they’ve found a new oppressor. The world isn’t a safer plac e, a better place, or a more democratic place. The American military can’t come home because new dangers threaten. It becomes apparent that the President exaggerated the original danger. New enemies emerge from the wa r’s wreckage — enemies that a future President will want to suppre ss by taking America into war again. Which American war is this? If you said the recent war in Iraq, you’d be right. But you’d also be right if you answered World War I — or World War II — or the Korean War or the Vietnam War — or the wars in Pana ma in 1989 and Iraq in 1991 — or even the Spanish-American War. It’s amazing how each war resembles its predecessor s in so many ways, just like Hollywood remakes of popular stories. Each plot con tains the same elements: America"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 9 threatened, an aggressive enemy, an evil dictator, oppressed people, a war for liberation, the promise of a new world order with peace and freedom . Since Americans generally have little interest in h istory and not much recollection of it, they tend to assume they’re watching a new drama ea ch time it’s performed. Few people realize that the claims and promises have all been made before. And almost all the claims and promises turn out to be false — every time. Over and over, Americans accept what the politician s say, go to war, pay a horrendous cost, discover that the claims and promises were wo rthless, and return to their private lives where they forget how they’ve been deceived. Politicians & Virtue Virtually everyone believes that politicians lie to get ahead — lie in their campaign promises, lie by faking compassion, lie about their voting records, and lie about their achievements. “How can you tell when a politician is lying?” goes the old joke. “His lips move.” But Americans also seem to assume that when a Presi dent says we must go to war, he must be telling the truth — that he’s put aside his lying ways and his own political interests, and now is concerned wholly with America’s safety a nd future. The contradiction is rarely noticed, but the record is clear. As this book will show, there’s a long history of politicians shading the t ruth to promote war — one war after another. Over and over, politicians have lied about dangers and evil enemies — and justified killing innocent people by promising that a new and more beautiful world will come from it. TYPES OF DECEPTIONS Politicians rely on four kinds of deceptions: • Prewar lies — exaggerations, omissions of fact, and outright falsehoods, generally told before the war — all designed to mak e us feel that we must go to war before a foreign enemy does great harm to America. • Rosy promises — assurances that the costs will be m odest and a small price to pay for the much better world to come."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 10 • Propaganda — false or highly selective reports of o ur victories and the enemy’s atrocities. This is supported by the suppre ssion of bad news — so Americans don’t hear about battles lost, the grueso me details of what “our boys” are going through, and anything else that mig ht lessen our eagerness to continue the violence. • Myths — the postwar perpetuation of the most univer sally appealing wartime lies, rosy promises, and propaganda. Legend s persist that, at various times, America was threatened by evil, comp romised by appeasement and hesitation, and then saved through determined action. These legends serve as lessons to remind us that it ’s better to charge into future wars without waiting for irrefutable evidenc e that the danger is real. Here we’ll look at each type of deception. Deception #1: PRE-WAR LIES Politicians judge correctly that the lies are neces sary because most people don’t want to go to war. In wartime, taxes rise, many consumer goods become unavailable, freedom is curtailed, and — most important — relatives and friends are ma imed or killed. And despite the superstition that war helps the eco nomy, few people actually profit from it. (How does producing tanks instead of cars raise our standard of living?) But politicians profit. War lets them stifle dissen t, reward friends with military contracts, and discourage voters from “changing hor ses in the middle of the stream.” And the conflict gives the President the opportunity to intimidate his opponents — by hinting that anyone questioning his judgment is unpatriotic . So politicians have an incentive to embellish — eve n fabricate — reasons for going to war. Of course, sometimes politicians are themselves mis led. But this doesn’t excuse them for proclaiming certainties when they have no hard evidence — making reckless assertions that send people to kill and die. Whatever the politicians actually believe, the resu lt is the same: they persuade the public that there’s no alternative to war, and they cause Americans to die unnecessarily. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 11 The Political Two-Step The politicians seldom remain faithful to any singl e reason for the war. Instead, like fickle lovers they dart from one reason to another. The opening drumbeat for war may be retaliation for a specific attack — or what seems to have been an attack — or the possibility of an a ttack. But then the story changes to the danger incurred if we ignore an evil enemy, and the n to a crusade to liberate oppressed people — a crusade that will lead to a better world and a new era of peace. The politicians dance from one compelling reason to another. If critics refute one rationale for war, the politicians quickly two-step to another. And when the war is over, the politicians may justi fy the tremendous losses by citing still another reason — one that hasn’t yet been dis credited, possibly one that no one had thought of before the war began. Types of Falsehoods The war-promoting falsehoods come in several forms: • Disinformation: the politicians say something they flat out know isn’t true. • Exaggeration: the government asserts something that has a kernel of truth, but that grossly exaggerates that kernel. • False certainty: the politicians proclaims as an ab solute fact something that’s no more than conjecture or opinion. • Omission: the government fails to mention facts tha t would weigh against the war. Cry Havoc! Often the first cry of “danger!” comes in response to a dramatic event — such as the sinking of the Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898, the Germans’ torpedoing of American ships in 1917, the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Gu lf of Tonkin incident in 1964, the 9/11 attack in 2001. The event angers the American people. The politicia ns make indignant speeches — stimulating a thirst for revenge. It seems self-evi dent that to do anything other than go to war would make cowards of us all. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 12 Because most Americans have limited knowledge conce rning history or foreign affairs, all they know is what they’re told at the moment — that a foreign aggressor is pure evil and must be stopped. And they have no way of knowing wh at U.S. politicians may have done off-camera to encourage or provoke the event. Almost everything the public knows about the situat ion originates from inside the government. And so most Americans accept whatever t he government tells them — true or false. The Pitch With or without a specific event, the politicians r ely on several tried-and-true themes: • America is threatened by someone. If we don’t stop the monster now, he’ll conquer other countries and eventually take over mo st of the world — leaving us isolated and facing an overwhelming foe. There are only two alternatives: war or cowardly appeasement. • Evil people are trying to conquer and oppress good people, and it’s the responsibility of stronger good people (that’s us) to come to the rescue of the oppressed. We may know nothing about the histor y or culture of the people involved, but by God we can recognize an evi l person when we see one. • Our allies in this endeavor are countries populated with brave, free, heroic people — led by a great “freedom-fighter.” • The enemy (who recently may have been a highly resp ected ally) is evil incarnate — the perpetrator of unspeakable atrociti es, the enslaver of its people, morally indistinguishable from savages. • The cause is just, and the issue is a clear-cut, bl ack-and-white case of Good vs. Evil. Anyone who disagrees with these assertions risks be ing labeled an enemy supporter, anti-American, or hopelessly naïve about world affa irs. Context Because most Americans’ knowledge of U.S. and world history consists mainly of enduring myths, they have little sense of the conte xt in which events are occurring — allowing the politicians to supply whatever context they find convenient."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 13 Americans have no understanding of the long-standin g feuds between warring countries, the events that may have provoked an ope ning attack by one country against another, or the despotic nature of governments that are held up as heroic allies. It’s as though history began on whatever day the politician s choose to emphasize. With no knowledge, for example, that Kuwait was as much a dictatorship as Iraq, or that South Korea’s government was as oppressive as North Korea’s, or that the Soviet Union was as nasty a prison as Nazi Germany — or th at Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo had been at each other’s throats for generations — it’s been easy for Americans to accept the black-and-white, good-vs-evil pictures painted by our government. Thus very few people challenge the lies. Deception #2: ROSY PROMISES Each crusade starts with a limited and specific goa l — which will be achieved quickly and at modest cost. Always we’re promised that our government’s magic touch is just what’s needed — and all that’s needed — to cure the current problem once a nd for all. Politicians paint a picture of the new era of peace and security to follow a war — the world “safe for democracy” that was to follow World War I, the Four Freedoms for which World War II was supposedly fought, the New World O rder to be ushered in by the Gulf War, a new era of democracy for the Middle East, an d on and on. However they package it, the prize will be a better world when the war is over — a freer, peaceful world of a wholly new kind. And since the promised peace never arrives, the pol iticians have a reason to go to war all over again — and again and again and again. The historian Charles Beard labeled this the “perpetual war for perpetual peace” — the nonst op conflict that’s always justified by the peace that’s supposed to emerge from the confli ct. 1 It doesn’t matter whether the politicians themselve s believe the promises or are simply trying to lure us into war. Either way, the promise s are never fulfilled.  1 P e r p e t u a l W a r f o r P e r p e t u a l P e a c e , e d i t e d b y H a r r y E l m e r B a r n e s , p a g e v i i i ."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 14 Deception #3: WARTIME PROPAGANDA War is grisly, shocking, and repugnant. The governm ent doesn’t want civilians to see it as it really is, because it’s far uglier than what people imagine. Soldiers don’t die in the clean, antiseptic style y ou see in a John Wayne movie. In a real war, their limbs are blown off, they see their own insides pour out onto the ground, and they die in excruciating pain. And many “combat” de aths aren’t even caused by enemy fire; they result from dysentery, pneumonia, shock, a com rade’s mistake, or even just fright. But the government needs to maintain patriotic ferv or. A clear picture of American soldiers being dismembered on the battlefield would n’t help. Worse yet is the thought that American soldiers, de spite their suffering and sacrifice, aren’t winning the war handily. People might be furious with the government if they were aware of the mistakes the military commanders were making, or the strategic b lunders being forced on the military by the President and his aides, or the innocent foreig n civilians being killed accidentally — or, worse yet, on purpose. So it’s a prime goal of the military, backed by the politicians, to keep the ugliness of battle and the thoughtless waste of lives and limbs from the American people. And it isn’t difficult to do. Because so much of ou r information comes from newspapers or television, we may not realize that m ost of that information is simply what the military authorities have told the reporters. Even when a journalist reports his own discoveries, it’s only what he’s been allowed to discover. He’s dependent on the military to get to the front lines, to interview soldiers, to know what’s going on. He can go only where the mili tary authorities let him go. He can’t talk to soldiers without a censor standing by, and the censor will edit everything he writes. All these restrictions on press freedom are justifi ed as necessary to keep information from the enemy. But the enemy, being on the battlef ield, already knows what’s happening. Censorship’s job is to keep information from the Am erican people . As Colonel P.J. Crowley, a National Security Counci l spokesman, said, “You have to plan your media strategy with as much attention as you plan your military strategy.” 2  2 Q u o t e d b y P h i l l i p K n i g h t l e y i n T h e F i r s t C a s u a l t y , p a g e 5 0 1 ."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 15 Politicians fear that if civilians saw the true fac e of war, they would vote the politicians out at the next election — or, worse yet, demand an immediate end to the slaughter. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, referrin g to the condition of British troops during World War I, said “If people really knew, th e war would be stopped tomorrow. But of course they don’t know and they can’t know.” 3 Paul Fussell added: Soldiers know that mistakes are the essence of war, because they know what is likely to happen when you arm a lot of frightened b oys with deadly weapons. But the public must not be told, lest their simple faith in military authority and rationality be shaken. 4 Civil Liberties Throughout the war, government propaganda maintains the notion that the situation is truly extraordinary and thus requires extraordinary measures — such as forgoing the protections of the Bill of Rights. We’re told that to keep our freedom, we must give i t up. After all, “the Constitution is not a suicide pact.” 5 New laws are passed — allowing the government to ja il dissidents, hold people without trial, investigate almost anything without regard to constitutional safeguards. And whatever Congress fails to enact, the President usu ally invokes on his own — with little protest from the public. In World War I, people were sent to prison merely f or saying that it was a mistake for America to enter Europe’s war. In World War II, nat ive-born Americans of Japanese ancestry, accused of no crime, were held in concent ration camps for four years. In the so- called War on Terrorism, U.S. citizens have been im prisoned indefinitely and without access to an attorney, with no way to communicate w ith anyone — as though the Constitution had no provisions for habeas corpus or the right to “a speedy and public trial.”  3 D e c e m b e r 2 8 , 1 9 1 7 .

But since there are no public trials, with due process of law, neither the government nor the public can possibly know for sure whether the accused really are dangerous. Propaganda is also aimed at keeping war critics on the defensive. We’re told that public arguments about the war discourage our troop s and encourage the enemy — and thus are not only unpatriotic but dangerous for our sold iers. Even calling attention to violations of the Constitution is considered subversive. If anyone protests America’s alliance with a foreig n dictator, the killing of innocent people, or the jailing of Americans without trial, he’s told that this is the wrong time to criticize our leaders. We must all pull together to defeat the wicked foe. We can analyze the government’s actions after the war. For now we must do our patriotic duty, obe y the President, and win the war. Anything else aids the enemy. Of course, after the war few people have any intere st in what the government did during the war. New controversies overshadow that o ld news. And the politicians who told the lies, clamored for war, and invaded our liberty are now retired, or are telling us that it’s time to move on. They say that no postwar investigation can undo the destruction, imprisonment, and killing that the lies and promises produced, so why bother? And besides, there are critical new problems that require our attention. Yes, it’s definitely time to move on. Atrocities One propaganda function is to remind us how despica bly evil the enemy is. The politicians keep reaching for fresh examples of the enemy’s wickedness — to keep us boiling with hate and fear. Atrocity stories com e off the assembly line — from the bayoneting of Belgian children by German soldiers d uring World War I — to the 1990 ejection of Kuwaiti babies from incubators by Iraqi troops — to the 2003-2004 mantra about “mass graves” in Iraq. Newspapers, magazines, radio, and television repeat the atrocity stories as though they were established fact — even though 99% of the stor ies originate from our government or from another government, and are retold without ind ependent verification. After the war, it turns out that most of the fabled atrocities either never happened or were greatly embellished in the telling — while the real horrors of war went unreported."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 17 Deception #4: ENDURING MYTHS When the war is over, the best lies become enshrine d as permanent myths — and are available to justify the next war. We hear over and over that the failure of the U.S. and its allies to stop Hitler at Munich led to World War II. Thus we shouldn’t wait for abs olute evidence of today’s tyrant’s plans to conquer the world; we must act now . Or the other side of the Hitler coin: If the U.S. h adn’t entered World War II, Hitler would have conquered Britain and then America — and we’d all be speaking German now. ( Mein Gott! ) Hitler was so undeniably a bad person that he serve s as the perfect boogeyman to scare us today. Nearly every new enemy — whether Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, or someone else — is portrayed as the current incarnation of Adolf Hitler, someone who must be destroyed before he gai ns the power to destroy us. As Nicholas von Hoffman has said, “Here a Hitler, t here a Hitler, everywhere a Hitler. Don’t leave home for war without this chestnut.” 6 After any war, it becomes clear that much of what w e were told was untrue. Whether the misinformation was blatant lying, exaggeration, deliberate omission, false promise, or just assertion without real evidence, the result is the same: people are dead for no good purpose, the American people have made pointless sa crifices, and more millions of people around the world have learned to fear America. But despite the truth that emerges after each war, the myths become fixed in the minds of most Americans: • If the U.S. hadn’t entered World War I, the Germans would have eventually invaded America. • If the U.S. hadn’t entered World War II, we’d all b e speaking Japanese today. • If America hadn’t stopped the Communists in Korea, they’d have overrun Asia. • If the U.S. hadn’t driven the Iraqis out of Kuwait in 1991, Saddam Hussein would have conquered the entire Middle East and tak en control of most of  6 “ G o i n g o f f t o W a r S u p p l i e d w i t h L i e s , ” T h e N e w Y o r k O b s e r v e r , M a r c h 7 , 2 0 0 3 ( h t t p : / / w w w . o b s e r v e r . c o m / p a g e s / s t o r y . a s p ?

Of course, there are unspoken considerations that m itigate against all these myths, but they’re rarely heard. The myths are convenient ways to explain history — and convenient arguments with which to promote the next war. Questions So compelling are the myths that rarely does anyone ask the questions that seem obvious once they’re raised: • Why did the Japanese, mired down in a difficult war in China, suddenly start a war with the United States — the most power ful country in the world? • Why did the U.S. have to intervene in Vietnam — a coun try with an insignificant economy, resources, and population? • Why did the Iranians occupy the U.S. embassy in Tehera n and hold Americans hostage for over a year? • Why did Iraq invade Kuwait in 1990? Of course, sometimes asking such questions can make you a moral leper. After hijackers crashed airliners into the World Trade Ce nter in 2001, if you asked why someone would give his own life to kill Americans, you risk ed being condemned for “justifying terrorism” or “blaming the victim.” When an answer is given to any of the questions, it’s usually that t he attackers are simply evil — or that they hate us for our freedom, prosperity, and democracy. It’s never mentioned that, while there are reasons someone mig ht give up his own life, envy of someone else’s freedom is rarely high on the list. THE BITTER AFTERMATH After a war is over, the truth gradually comes to l ight — for anyone who wants to see it. It turns out that the threat wasn’t real or cou ld have been dealt with short of war. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 19 And the poor foreigners — the ones we were fighting to liberate — are still under the yoke of an oppressor, either the same one or a repl acement our government helped to install. And sometime later, documents emerge showing that t he evil enemy leader wasn’t as dangerous as our government had made him out to be — and that the incident that triggered the war was far more complicated than the politicia ns admitted at the time. But Americans are now preoccupied with their peacet ime lives, and so they don’t care that much about past events. Any revelation that un dermines the original war story is seen as ancient history — no more relevant to the presen t or the future than King Tut. HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF The political deceptions come in four packages: • The lies told to get us into war, • The promises made of a quick victory, low costs, and a better p ostwar world, • The wartime propaganda designed to maintain continuing support for the war, and • The myths that become enshrined and make it easier to sell f uture wars. In the following chapters, we’ll see how these dece ptions were applied in the American wars of the 20th and 21st century. Repetition History doesn’t flow from a Xerox machine. Human be ings change with experience and new circumstances. But while every war is diffe rent, the lies, promises, myths, and propaganda accompany war after war after war — and often it’s the same lies and promises that are told in war after war. One of the biggest lies of all has been repeated of ten in recent years: “9/11 changed everything.” In fact, 9/11 (the September 11, 2001, destruction of the World Trade Center) had plenty of precedent. There had been attacks — even terrorist attacks — on the U.S. before. And those attacks led to the same kinds of military responses, invasions of civil liberties, increases in government, and promises of a better w orld to come. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 20 WHY DO POLITICIANS LIE US INTO WAR? It’s natural to wonder why politicians have worked so hard — including propagating so many deceptions — to get Americans into war. There are several reasons: • As Randolph Bourne said, “War is the health of the state.” 7 In wartime, national unity is the theme, and the President can get Congress to approve almost any program he wants — whether or not it fur thers the war effort. Just put “security” or “defense” in the title of a bill, and no one dares oppose it. As a result, during wartime government g rows rapidly — in both power and cost — and never returns to its prewar si ze. • Because it’s risky to dissent from popular opinions during wartime, Presidents receive much less criticism. Members of the press become unpaid press agents, relaying whatever the Presiden t wants the people to believe. The approval ratings for Franklin Roosevel t, Harry Truman, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush were at their highest levels while the nation was at war. • History honors wartime Presidents. Look at any list of the “greatest” Presidents, and you’ll always find Washington, Linc oln, Wilson, FDR, and Truman in the top eight or so. The only somewhat pe aceful President to get near the top of the list is Thomas Jefferson — who might be out of the running if it weren’t for the Declaration of Indepe ndence. In addition, Presidents can easily be fooled into t hinking that war can truly achieve something worthwhile. Like most Americans, most Pre sidents are ignorant of world history, and of the cultures and animosities of for eign populations. Thus they walk into foreign entanglements thinking they know how to fix any problem, heal any hostility. And because Presidents are insulated from the real world by yes-men, there’s no one to show them that they’re walking unarmed into a nest of vipers. The insulation by yes-men also encourages a President’s feeling that he can a chieve anything. World peace? No problem; just get the foreign leaders together and tell them what to do — the way a President does with Congressional leaders. One way or another — through intention, from ignora nce, by mistaking domestic power for international leadership — a President fi nds it very easy to believe that  7 “ T h e S t a t e , ” u n p u b l i s h e d e s s a y , B o u r n e M S S , C o l u m b i a U n i v e r s i t y L i b r a r i e s ( h t t p : / / w w w . b i g e y e . c o m / r b q u o t e s . h t m ) ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 21 sacrificing a few American lives is a worthwhile pr ice to pay for the glory that will come from winning a war and changing the world. It’s ironic that wartime Presidents are so revered. As we will see, without exception the wartime Presidents of the past hundred years have l ied, mismanaged war efforts, failed to deliver on their rosy promises, ignored the Constit ution, and done immeasurable harm to America. It’s hard to believe that anyone would con sider those the proper qualifications for “greatness.” SHOULD POLITICIANS LIE? Some people believe politicians should lie to us. They think politicians have superior knowledge and foresight — and that sometimes they n eed to lie to induce us mere mortals to do the right thing. For example, historian Thomas Bailey, referring to the lies Franklin Roosevelt told to drag Americans into World War II, said: He was like the physician who must tell the patient lies for the patient’s own good. . . . Because the masses are notoriously shor tsighted and generally cannot see danger until it is at their throats, our statesmen are forced to deceive them into an awareness of their own long-ru n interests. 8 I don’t know about you, but I certainly don’t want a doctor who’s going to lie to me “for the patient’s own good.” And as for being shortsighted, while a corporate ex ecutive acts to protect his company’s earnings for many years ahead, while a bu ilding owner spends money for repairs today to protect the value of his property tomorrow, and while a family starts feeding its children’s college fund years in advanc e, few politicians can see anything beyond the next election. And except for knowing how to get elected, politici ans have no more understanding or foresight than the rest of us — maybe less, since t hey’re so obsessed with political considerations.

I’m not a historian. There is little original resea rch here. I haven’t rummaged through the private papers of prominent politicians. I have n’t fought for access to government documents through the Freedom of Information Act. S o there are no startling revelations for scholars here — even if some of the history is new to you. Most everything you’ll read here has long been know n to historians, and very little of it is even controversial. Most historians argue only o ver whether the politicians were justified in the lies they told — not over whether they actua lly told them. (Strangely, scholars and pundits who acknowledge the lies of bygone politici ans often accept whatever the current politicians are telling us about threats to the Uni ted States.) This book has long been needed. While most people k now that lies are told here and there, few are aware of how systematic the lying is . The pattern of lies is laid out here — lies that ha ve cost hundreds of thousands of American lives in European and Asian wars that achi eved nothing for the United States, and thousands of lives lost in attacks by terrorist s whose hatred was fed by the ambitions of our own politicians. Preoccupation with American Lies This isn’t a “hate America” book. I’ve written it because I love America.

On the eve of the war, the Austrio-Hungarian Empire included what is now Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cr oatia, and Bosnia, as well as territory that’s now in Italy and Romania. On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the hei r to the Austrian throne, and his wife were visiting Bosnia. They were assassinated b y a Serb who wanted Bosnia to become part of Serbia. The Austrian government accused the Serbian governm ent of engineering the assassination. The Austrians issued a 48-hour ultim atum to Serbia, demanding numerous conditions that the Serbs couldn’t accept. 10 The major nations of Europe, all of which were part ies to mutual defense treaties, reacted to the crisis by mobilizing for war. Russia agreed to come to the aid of Serbia, and France agreed to honor a long-standing commitment t o Russia. Germany pledged to support Austria. On July 27, Germany urged Austria to negotiate with Serbia, but Austria refused. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Germany then urged Austria to limit the war, so it wouldn’t spread throughout Eur ope. Again Austria refused. The German and Russian governments exchanged telegrams in an a ttempt to stop the Austria-Serbia war from widening, but they didn’t succeed. Germany also appealed to Britain to intervene to pr event the war from spreading. By July 31, the Germans were aware that Russia was mobilizing its army, and they demanded that the mobilization cease. The Germans a lso sent an ultimatum to France, demanding that France remain neutral if Russia and Germany should go to war.  1 0 T h e C a u s e s o f W o r l d W a r I b y S t e w a r t R o s s , p a g e 4 8 ."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 26 Russia made no reply to the German demand, and so o n August 1 Germany declared war on Russia.

On August 3, having failed to receive a satisfactor y reply from France, Germany declared war against France and marched into Belgiu m on its way to France. Howard S. Katz has pointed out that Germany attacke d first because it was the underdog — having to fight a two-front war with Fra nce and Russia. Katz explained that this is a common sequence in war: The situation builds toward war. It totters on the brink. Then the weaker country, needing the element of surprise, attacks f irst. The stronger can afford the luxury of military superiority. 11 On August 4 Britain declared war against Germany, h onoring an 1839 pact guaranteeing the independence and neutrality of Bel gium. 12 The war was underway, and eventually the two sides lined up as follows: The Allies: Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Belgium, Romania, Greece, China, Brazil, Portugal, Montenegro, Japan, and Serbia. 13 The Central Powers: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey (the Ottoman Empire). 14 What were Japan and China doing in a European confl ict? The Japanese saw the war as an opportunity to confiscate Germany’s colonies in the Far East. 15 China hoped to win favor with the Allies, so that they would quit inte rfering in China.  1 1 T h e W a r m o n g e r s b y H o w a r d S .

It was more than twice the size of the German and Austrian navies combined. 16 Within weeks of the start of war, it had rendered most of the German navy useless. 17 Three months after the war started, the British nav y blockaded German ports with ships and mines — preventing cargo ships from reaching Ge rmany. The Germans were powerless to break the blockade, which continued throughout t he war — and even afterward. The British promised to sink any neutral ship carry ing “contraband” to the Germans. The British kept expanding the definition of contra band until it covered even food — leading to starvation and food riots in Germany. 18 Winston Churchill, who was then the First Lord of t he Admiralty (equivalent to the U.S. Secretary of the Navy), said the object of the blockade was to . . . . . . starve the whole population — men, women, and children, old and young, wounded and sound — into submission. 19 Historian Charles F. Vincent has said the blockade prevented even a single loaf of bread from reaching Germany. By 1917 Germans were l iving on only half the minimum daily requirement of calories. The death rate among civilians was 32% higher than in 1913. 20 By one estimate, 750,000 German civilians died fro m hunger and malnutrition. 21 After the war, George E.R. Gedye reported on the re sults of the British blockade. He said: Hospital conditions were appalling.

To counter the British blockade, the Germans labele d the sea around the British Isles a war zone — and said that ships carrying war supplie s to Britain would be attacked by German submarines. The German U-boats were flimsy and virtually helple ss when on the ocean surface. But while submerged they were lethal instruments. They destroyed a great deal of British cargo. AMERICAN ‘NEUTRALITY’ Prewar Lie & Surviving Myth: The United States was neutral in the war prior to Germany’s submarine attacks in early 1917. At the start of the war, American President Woodrow Wilson pledged that the U.S. would be strictly neutral. On August 19, 1914, two weeks after the war began, he asked the American people to be: . . . neutral in fact, as well as in name, during these days that are to try men’s souls.

In his vision, war would become virtually impossible, with peace enfor ced by a new world organization of his making. Later, Secretary of State Robert Lansing referred t o Wilson’s “dream of possessing a beneficent domination over the nations, both bellig erent and neutral.” 24 Wilson claimed that he had to control the peace con ference to prevent the Allies from imposing vengeful terms on Germany — demanding huge reparations, territory, and other penalties — which he said would lead to further war s. The Neutrality Sham Wilson’s neutrality was a fraud, however. Virtually everyone near the top of the Wilson admin istration, and especially Wilson himself, was an Anglophile — an admirer of British culture and the British way of life. Every one of them was pulling for the Allies to win . Wilson told his secretary, Joseph Tumulty, that he wanted to do everything possible to assure an Allied victory, saying: England is fighting our fight and you may well unde rstand that I shall not, in the present state of the world’s affairs, place obs tacles in her way. . . .

Because the French and Russian governments were virtually broke by then, England was paying for most of the Allies’ side of the war. 26 U.S. banks had lent the Allies (mostly England) $2 .3 billion (about $25 billion in 2004 dollars), nearly all of which was spent in the U.S. on war materials. 27 To the best of my knowledge, no military supplies w ere sent from the U.S. to Germany or Austria. In fact, from 1914 to 1916, U.S. trade with Germany declined from $169 million per year to just $1 million. During that same time, U.S. trade with the Allies r ose to $3 billion from $824 million. 28 That trade, especially the trade financed on credi t, provided a motive for some Americans to want the U.S. to join the war with the Allies — to assure that the Allies could continue to buy supplies from the U.S. and repay th eir loans to U.S. banks. Almost from the beginning of the war, Wilson’s supp ort of the Allies drew America close to the edge of war — as he invited German sub marine attacks while honoring the British blockade that was starving the Germans. Submarine Warfare The British government encouraged American ships to try to sail through the German blockade around the British Isles. They hoped that enough Americans would die in submarine attacks to provoke the U.S. into entering the war.

He not only thought American passengers made a Brit ish ship immune to attack, he also believed American ships had a right to carry m unitions to Britain without being attacked. He later told Americans that the Germans’ submarine warfare was “a warfare against mankind . . . a war against all nations.” 31 It had never before been asserted that a neutral ship had the right to enter a war zone unmolested. And neither Norway, Sweden, Spain, nor the nations of South America protested the German b lockade. 32 (In fact, in World War II American submarines attac ked any ship that defied a blockade.)

There were two large explosio ns. Over 1,100 men, women, and children died, including 128 Americans. Lie: The Lusitania was an unarmed passenger liner and was attacked wi thout provocation by a German submarine. The British claimed that the submarine fired an unn ecessary second torpedo, causing the ship to sink more quickly and trapping more pas sengers. American politicians and journalists were indignant at the thought that the Germans would fire a second torpedo — in effect murdering innocent people. The Germans denied firing a second torpedo, and the y were almost certainly telling the truth. 35 But the denial received little respect in the U.S. — where almost a year of anti- German propaganda had taught Americans to disregard any German claims. 36 Lie: There were no munitions on board the Lusitania . In truth, the ship was carrying at least 5,468 case s of ammunition, bound for the British Army. 37 The second explosion was probably caused by these munitions or by a ruptured boiler. The U.S. government made no attempt to dete rmine what caused the second explosion, preferring to let the public think the w orst of the Germans. And no one was allowed access to the cargo manifest. But Dudley Field Malone, Collector of the Port of N ew York, had warned Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan that the ship was carr ying munitions. Bryan in turn had insisted that President Wilson stop the Lusitania from sailing. 38 Comparing the German blockade of England to the Bri tish blockade of Germany, Bryan — the one peace-loving neutral in Wilson’s ca binet — asked, “Why be shocked by the drowning of a few people, if there is to be no objection to starving a nation?” 39  3 5 L u s i t a n i a : A n E p i c T r a g e d y b y D i a n a P r e s t o n , p a g e s 4 0 2 - 4 0 3 . 3 6 P r o p a g a n d a f o r W a r : T h e C a m p a i g n a g a i n s t A m e r i c a n N e u t r a l i t y , 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 b y H .

The week before the Lusitania sailed, the German government ran large ads in New York newspap ers warning Americans not to sail on the ship. 41 As writer Robert Brakeman summed it up: The Lusitania was a British auxiliary war cruiser, it was carryi ng tons of munitions, it was armed, and it was traveling throu gh a war zone, so it should not have been surprising when it was attacked in Ma y of 1915. Nonetheless Wilson and company lied about the incident in every possible way, from the nature of the ship to the nature of its cargo, to t he location of the provoked-or- unprovoked nature of the attack and its predictabil ity or unexpectedness (Americans had been warned in newspaper ads not to travel on the warship). 42 But Wilson maintained that all Americans had a righ t to travel unharmed on ships of warring countries — even if they were sailing into a war zone — and the British urged travelers not to be afraid of sailing on British sh ips. Of course, British politicians felt that the more A mericans killed, the better — because it would draw America into the war. Due to the mythology surrounding World War I, many Americans assume the U.S. went to war because of the sinking of the Lusitania — much as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor triggered American entry into World War II. But the U.S. didn’t declare war on Germany until almost two years after the Lusitania went down.  4 0 P r o p a g a n d a f o r W a r b y S t e w a r t H a l s e y R o s s , p a g e s 1 5 6 - 1 5 7 . 4 1 P r o p a g a n d a f o r W a r b y S t e w a r t H a l s e y R o s s , p a g e 1 3 6 . 4 2 “ W i l l i a m J e n n i n g s B r y a n ” b y R o b e r t B r a k e m a n , S o u t h e r n L i b e r t a r i a n R e v i e w , J u l y 1 9 7 6 , p a g e 9 ; c i t e d i n T h e W a r m o n g e r s b y H o w a r d S .

However, the sympathy toward the British wasn’t una nimous, nor did it include a desire to enter the war. It required a number of fa ctors to stir up the enormous anti-German feeling that pushed America into war in 1917. Cutting of Communications to America At the start of the war in August 1914, the British ship Telconia sailed to the German port of Emden. The ship, normally used to repair un dersea telegraph cables, severed all the telegraph lines linking Germany and the Western Hem isphere. The only other telegraph cable from continental Eur ope to the Americas was a roundabout route that passed through Liberia to Bra zil, and it was cut six months later. So Germany could communicate quickly with the U.S. only by radio — at the time a new and unreliable medium. 43 Before the war was a week old, the British Parliame nt passed the Defense of the Realm Act, which — among other things — allowed British c ensors to monitor, edit, and kill every news story passing through England to the Uni ted States. Since all telegraphic traffic from Europe to the United States had to pass throug h London, Americans heard very little of the German version of events. 44 Anti-German Propaganda But Americans heard a lot of anti-German propaganda . Canadian novelist Gilbert Parker set up a British p ropaganda office in the U.S. He assembled a mailing list of 260,000 influential Ame ricans to whom his office regularly sent propaganda — such as stories of German atrocities. In addition, he published a weekly  4 3 T h e Z i m m e r m a n n T e l e g r a m b y B a r b a r a T u c h m a n , p a g e s 8 - 9 o f t h e p a p e r b a c k e d i t i o n . 4 4 C o n g r e s s i o n a l R e c o r d , 6 5 t h C o n g r e s s , 1 s t s e s s i o n , H o u s e , A p r i l 5 , 1 9 1 7 , 5 5 , p t . 1 , 3 4 2 ; c i t e d i n T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 4 3 ."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 35 news service mailed to 360 small-town American news papers. And he brought more than a hundred celebrities from England, to be interviewed by American reporters. Parker’s office was plenty busy; it employed 54 people. After America entered the war in 1917, Parker wrote an article for Harper’s Monthly in which he bragged that his efforts had helped bring America into the war. 45 In addition, American newspapers and anti-German or ganizations relayed British stories of German atrocities, almost all of which w ere later proven to be false. 46 Thus by 1917 Americans had learned to hate Germany. BELGIUM & THE ATROCITY STORIES Myth: Belgium was an innocent victim of German aggressio n. The major European powers signed a treaty in 1839 g uaranteeing Belgium’s neutrality. When the war started, the Germans offered to pay Be lgium and Luxembourg for any property damage and for any supplies if these natio ns would allow German troops to move through their countries on their way to France. Lux embourg accepted, but Belgium refused. German troops moved through Belgium anyway — a clea r violation of Belgian neutrality. And the world reacted in horror at this intrusion on little Belgium. However, when the Germans captured Brussels, they f ound documents in the Belgian Foreign Office containing a Belgian promise of loya lty to the British and French. When the war started, Belgium already had an army of 340,000 men — 5% of the country’s total population. 47 Even if the Germans had not invaded, it’s unlikely that Belgium would have remained neutral for very long. The violation of Belgian neutrality was widely publ icized in the U.S., but practically no attention was paid to the Allies’ seizure of Cor fu, an island belonging to Greece, which also had been guaranteed neutrality by the European powers. 48  4 5 “ T h e U n i t e d S t a t e s a n d t h e W a r ” b y G i l b e r t P a r k e r , H a r p e r ’ s M o n t h l y , M a r c h 1 9 1 8 , p a g e s 5 2 1 - 5 3 1 ; c i t e d i n T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 4 4 . 4 6 P r o p a g a n d a f o r W a r b y S t e w a r t H a l s e y R o s s , p a g e s 4 5 - 5 1 . 4 7 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e s 5 0 , 5 1 , 6 0 . 4 8 “ W o r l d W a r I : T h e T u r n i n g P o i n t ” b y R a l p h R a i c o , i n T h e C o s t s o f W a r , p a g e 2 1 6"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 36 Atrocities in Belgium Wartime propaganda: The Germans committed unspeakable atrocities as they bulldozed their way through Belgium. Stories of German atrocities in Belgium were circul ated around the world, but few were supported by any meaningful evidence. There’s little doubt that the Germans executed a nu mber of civilians and burned some towns. However, the British were also killing civil ians with their blockade. But only the German atrocities were publicized in the American p ress and by American politicians, because the British controlled the cable traffic to the U.S. In fact, few Americans were even aware of the British blockade. The British and American press told stories of Germ an sadism — the raping of Belgian women and the mutilation of their bodies, as well a s the spearing of Belgian babies on German bayonets. The British paid a Belgian group t o tour America and tell their lurid tales. Woodrow Wilson welcomed the group to the Whi te House. 49 British newspapers claimed that the Kaiser had pers onally ordered German pilots to kill the children of King Albert of Belgium, that G erman submarine commanders received rewards for sinking ships carrying women and childr en, and that the Kaiser had personally specified the tortures to be inflicted on Belgian c hildren. 50 It may seem that such stories were simply too absur d to be believed. But once someone treats a person or foreign nation as the enemy, he’ s likely to believe almost anything that fuels his hatred — thereby justifying the killing o f innocent people in the enemy nation. This has proven to be true in war after war. After the Belgian atrocity stories surfaced in 1914 , eight American reporters traveled with the German army through Belgium. On September 3, 1914, they managed to sneak a telegram through to the Associated Press: In spirit fairness we unite in declaring German atr ocities groundless as far as we were able to observe.

Wartime propaganda: The Bryce commission has confirmed that the Germans committed unspeakable atrocities in Belgium . The Bryce report was sent to virtually every newspa per in America. It seemed to confirm all the lurid stories of German soldiers ra ping, mutilating, killing children, looting, and using civilians as shields. 52 But the Bryce Commission didn’t investigate a singl e incident in the locations where they supposedly occurred. They simply accepted the testimony of Belgian refugees who weren’t even under oath or cross-examined. No witne ss was identified by name in the final report. 53 American attorney Clarence Darrow was skeptical and went to France, where he offered large rewards to anyone who could produce a single victim of the alleged atrocities. No one came forward to collect. 54 The famous author Hendrik van Loon (who wrote The Story of Mankind and The Story of the Bible ) was the Associated Press correspondent on the Ger man front in Belgium; he called the atrocity stores “indecent lies.” William Shepherd, a United Press correspondent, spent several months in Belgium looking for verifie d atrocities but couldn’t find even one. Donald Thompson, an American photographer, was offe red a big reward for photographs of a German atrocity, but he couldn’t provide any. A U .S. State Department report eventually judged that not a single Belgian atrocity story was true. 55  5 1 P r o p a g a n d a f o r W a r : T h e C a m p a i g n a g a i n s t A m e r i c a n N e u t r a l i t y , 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 b y H .

But in 1915, Am ericans were sold the idea that the Germans — and only the Germans — were inhuman butch ers who had committed wicked atrocities. 56 The Corpse Factories Perhaps the worst atrocity story peddled during the war concerned dead German soldiers. Wartime propaganda: The Germans have corpse factories near their front lines. The bodies of dead German soldiers are boile d and simmered — distilling oils and bone powder for munitions, pig’ s food, and manure. This story first appeared in the London Times on April 16, 1917, and was spread around the world — receiving considerable publicity in the United States. It was 1925 before the truth emerged. British Briga dier-General John Charteris admitted that he had invented the story out of whol e cloth. An editorial in the Richmond, Virginia, Times-Dispatch summed up the harm the story had caused: A few years ago the story of how the Kaiser was red ucing human corpses to fat aroused the citizens of this and other enlighte ned nations to a fury of hatred. Normally sane men doubled their fists and r ushed off to the nearest recruiting sergeant.

But the revelation of so many fake atrocity stories caused many people to di sbelieve the true stories. Atrocities occur in virtually every war because you ng men are put in situations where they must kill or be killed — which leads to fear, which leads to hatred, which leads to brutality. CENSORSHIP Not only did the British publicize lies about the G ermans, censorship kept any bad news from reaching the British population. Phillip Knightley says the British lost more office rs in the first few months of the war than in all the British wars of the previous centur y combined. 59 But no matter how many battles were lost, no matter how many men died, the British people heard only good news. Historian Howard Zinn cited the words of an unident ified Englishman: The most bloody defeat in the history of Britain . . . might occur . . . and our Press come out bland and copious and graphic with n othing to show that we had not had quite a good day — a victory really. 60 The British press volunteered to hide the truth. The London Times frankly admitted afterward: A principal aim of the war policy of Printing House Square [the Times office] was to increase the flow of recruits. It was an aim that would get little help from accounts of what happened to recruits once the y became soldiers. 61  5 8 “ A m e r i c a n F o r e i g n P o l i c y — t h e T u r n i n g P o i n t , 1 8 9 8 - 1 9 1 9 ” b y R a l p h R a i c o , i n T h e F a i l u r e o f A m e r i c a ’ s F o r e i g n W a r s , e d i t e d b y R i c h a r d M .

The war started badly for them in 1914. The first few months shatte red the French army’s plan to overrun the German heartland. Over 500,000 French soldiers died or were wounded in the first four months of the war, and at least one million by the end of 1915. 62 But the French public had no idea that anything was wrong. General Jacques-Césaire Joffre, the chief of the French General Staff, had imposed strict censorship. Journalists were not allowed near the frontline. Consequently the French people assumed that their a rmies were marching forward, winning victory after victory. French General Josep h-Simon Gallieni, in civilian clothes, was dining in Paris with a friend, when he heard a newspaper editor at the next table saying to his companion, “I can tell you that General Gall ieni has just entered Colmar with 30,000 men.” Gallieni said to his friend, “That is how his tory is written.” 63 Reporters were occasionally allowed near a battle z one, but only on a guided tour that showed them what the generals wanted them to see. 64 The Germans applied the same kind of censorship. As German writer Erich Marie Remarque portrayed it in his classic novel, on the bloodiest days, when tens of thousands of Germans were killed, the official dispatches announ ced “All Quiet on the Western Front.” 65 The British government also cracked down on any dis senting opinions. For example, Bertrand Russell, the famous mathematician and phil osopher, wrote an article opposing the war. The government claimed it was seditious. He wa s fired from his teaching post at Cambridge, deprived of his passport, prevented from speaking at public meetings, and put in jail for six months. 66 U.S. Censorship Later, when America entered the war, U.S. censorshi p went to ridiculous lengths to paint a portrait of nice, brave American soldiers p erforming nicely and bravely. For example, when American war correspondents repor ted that friendly French people gratefully gave cases of wine to American soldiers, the American censors killed the stories  6 2 T h e S o m m e b y A .

Most of what we think we know about who the good gu ys are, who the bad guys are, and who did what to whom, emanates from a governmen t that wants you to think in the “right” way; nothing else is permitted. What the American people “knew” about World War I p rior to the U.S. entry was what the British government chose to feed to the America n press — and the American people accepted those stories as factual. After the U.S. entry, practically everything Americ ans heard about the war emanated from the U.S. government. A permanent pattern was established — in which a U. S. government official leaks a story confidentially to reporters, who in turn publ ish the allegations as fact. With enough repetition, the leak becomes “common knowledge” tha t “everyone knows.” Thus it is wise to accept nothing that’s told about a war that doesn’t come with detailed supporting evidence.  6 7 T h e F i r s t C a s u a l t y b y P h i l l i p K n i g h t l e y , p a g e 1 4 0 ."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 42 3 America Enters the War Wilson’s public neutrality was a sham. His actual p olicy was to help Britain and hinder Germany. The duplicity worked. His sham neutrality and feign ed opposition to war were accepted at face value by the American public and by most po liticians. Even today schoolchildren learn that Woodrow Wilson was a man of peace. He kept America officially neutral in order to posi tion himself to oversee the postwar peace conference. Wilson’s success as an orator had convinced him that he could persuade anyone of anything. He believed he could dominate t he peace conference and impose on the Allies his plans to reorder the world. Such conceit is not rare among Presidents. Power an d insulation from criticism have caused many Presidents to believe they could do any thing they choose. But as the war proceeded, British Prime Minister Da vid Lloyd George — who was desperate for America to join the war — began telli ng Wilson that the Allies would exclude him from the peace conference if they won the war w ithout America’s help. Eventually Wilson was convinced. Myth: Wilson’s leadership kept America out of the war un til 1917, when German submarine attacks made war unavoidable.

But at the Democratic nominating convention that su mmer, an early speaker electrified the delegates by declaring “Wilson kept us out of w ar.” The phrase became a convention slogan, and the delegates went wild every time Wils on was hailed as the man of peace. 70 So Wilson reluctantly ran for reelection as the pea ce candidate. Although he is frequently described as an “idealist,” he easily tr aded his ideals for political votes and campaigned against the Republicans as warmongers. I n a speech on September 30, 1916, he said: . . . The certain prospect of the success of the Re publican Party [in the election] is that we shall be drawn in one form or other into the embroilments of the European war. 71 Despite the long-running anti-German propaganda, Am ericans generally wanted to stay out of the war. Most Democrats were for peace — as were many people in the Republican Party who called themselves “progressive.” Even so, Democrats were still the minority party, a nd Wilson just barely won reelection in 1916, not even winning a majority of the popular vote — and the Democrats lost seats in both houses of Congress, just barely keeping control. 72 Wilson’s charge that the Republicans would drag Ame rica into war resonated with the American people, just like Lyndon Johnson’s charge in 1964 that Barry Goldwater would escalate fighting in Vietnam.  7 0 “ A m e r i c a n F o r e i g n P o l i c y — t h e T u r n i n g P o i n t , 1 8 9 8 - 1 9 1 9 ” b y R a l p h R a i c o , i n T h e F a i l u r e o f A m e r i c a ’ s F o r e i g n W a r s , e d i t e d b y R i c h a r d M .

Zimmermann Telegram In early 1917 British intelligence intercepted a te legram from German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann to Germany’s ambassador in Mexico . The British decoded the text and relayed it to the U.S. government. The telegram told the German ambassador to ask the Mexican government for help if the U.S. went to war with Germany, and to promise M exico that it would get back Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona if the Germans won the war.

That’s why the Allies were so eager for America to get into the war. Unrestricted Submarine Warfare Through 1916, German submarines avoided attacking A merican ships. The traditional rules of war allowed a country at war to sink ships supplying their enemies, but the Germans had feared that sinking American ships coul d bring the U.S. into the war. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 45 However, on February 1, 1917, Germany began unrestr icted submarine warfare — warning that they would sink any ship carrying supplies to their enemies. 73 The Germans were gambling that an absolute blockade of the Brit ish Isles would force the British to give up before the Americans could mobilize to save them . 74 The U.S. government immediately severed diplomatic relations with Germany. Wilson also asked Congress to authorize the arming of merc hant ships, but Congress refused. Smarting from the rejection, Wilson uttered a phras e that has become famous: “A little group of willful men, representing no opinion but t heir own, have rendered the great Government of the United States helpless and contem ptible.” 75 Wilson then armed the ships on his own authority — publicizing the text of the Zimmermann telegram, which he had kept to himself u p to then, as a justification for arming the ships. 76 Over the next two months, several American cargo sh ips were sunk in the war zone around the British Isles. In all, during the three years before America entered the war, 17 U.S. ships were sunk, killing 66 Americans. Another 131 Americans died while on British ships, including 128 on the Lusitania . 77 So, to avenge the deaths of 197 Americans, Woodrow Wilson took the U.S. into a war that killed over 100,000 Americans. Reasons for Going to War By 1917 many large U.S. firms were prospering from British purchases of war materials, and some had become totally dependent on these sales. But the British were running out of money, and it seemed unlikely that t hey could continue paying for what they wanted.  7 3 A P e o p l e ’ s H i s t o r y o f t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s b y H o w a r d Z i n n , p a g e 3 6 1 . 7 4 T h e Z i m m e r m a n n T e l e g r a m b y B a r b a r a T u c h m a n , p a g e 1 4 1 ; c i t e d i n A R e p u b l i c , N o t A n E m p i r e b y P a t r i c k J .

Woodrow Wilson had his own motives. Lie: Wilson reluctantly asked America to go to war beca use Germany was attacking American shipping. As we saw, Wilson had made up his mind to go to war a year before he asked Congress to declare war. He wanted to supervise the peace co nference, so that he could impose his ideas on the world. But the Allies had made it clea r that he would have no place at the peace table if America didn’t join the war. AMERICA GOES TO WAR ON WILSON’S PROMISES In March 1917, German submarines sank four American ships in the war zone, killing 15 sailors. 78 On April 2 Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to declare war. 79 By then, thanks to 2½ years of unanswered propaganda from the British and American governments, the American people believed that the Germans were inhu man butchers and that war was unavoidable. Americans had been primed for war. After all, they knew the Germans started the war, the Germans committed unspeakable atrocities, the G ermans sank American commercial ships without warning or provocation, and the Germa ns intended to conquer America and give the southwest United States to Mexico. They kn ew all these things because they’d heard them over and over and over again — all such “facts” having originated with either the British or the U.S. government. On April 4 the Senate voted for war, 82 to 6. The n ext day the House approved, 373 to 50. President Wilson signed the resolution on April 6, 1917, and the U.S. was officially at war with Germany. 80  7 8 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 2 . 7 9 T h e c o m p l e t e t e x t o f t h e w a r - d e c l a r a t i o n s p e e c h i s a t I n f o P l e a s e ( h t t p : / / w w w . i n f o p l e a s e . c o m / i p a / A 0 9 0 0 1 4 4 . h t m l ) . 8 0 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e s 3 7 a n d 4 1 ."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 47 Even though the war began when Austria-Hungary decl ared war on Serbia, Wilson didn’t ask for a declaration of war against Austria -Hungary until December 4, 1917 — eight months after asking for a declaration of war against Germany. 81 Wilson’s war-declaration speech was filled with bot h lies and rosy promises. Like so many presidential speeches, it was empty rhetoric d esigned to stir the patriotic juices, excite the emotions, and get the faithful cheering. But th e speech offered no real information. Here are just a few of the many naïve, misleading, or false statements in Woodrow Wilson’s wartime speeches. Democracy Rosy Promise: The world will be at peace, it will be safe for sm all nations, and people will choose their own governments. In his war-declaration speech, Wilson said: [W]e shall fight for the things which we have alway s carried nearest our hearts — for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own Governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free. 82 Wilson eventually abandoned every one of those thin gs “we shall fight for,” and none of them came to pass. As we’ll see, wars were the r ule during the 1920s, small nations were subjugated by large ones, and tens of millions of p eople were herded against their will into nations chosen by the Allied governments. One has to wonder whether any politician could be s o naïve as to think that a war could force the world into peace, security, and self-dete rmination.  8 1 T h e P u b l i c P a p e r s o f W o o d r o w W i l s o n , v o l u m e 4 5 , p a g e s 1 9 4 - 1 9 9 ; c i t e d i n T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 1 6 5 . 8 2 T h e c o m p l e t e t e x t o f t h e w a r - d e c l a r a t i o n s p e e c h i s a t I n f o P l e a s e ( h t t p : / / w w w . i n f o p l e a s e . c o m / i p a / A 0 9 0 0 1 4 4 . h t m l ) ."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 48 But then, such vacuous statements by Presidents are a recurring feature in American wars. In that speech, Wilson uttered his most famous line . . . The world must be made safe for democracy. 83 In the 1930s, historian James Harvey Robinson saw t hat for what it was worth: With supreme irony, the war to “make the world safe for democracy” ended by leaving democracy more unsafe in the world than at any time since the collapse of the revolutions of 1848. 84 No More Secret Agreements Lie & Rosy Promise: There will be no more secret treaties. In his famous Fourteen Points speech of January 8, 1918, Wilson said that the postwar world would contain only: Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after w hich there shall be no private international understandings of any kind bu t diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view. 85 In addition to being an unrealistic promise, this w as a plain lie. Eight months earlier, in May 1917, the British government had sent Wilson co pies of secret agreements made among the British, French, Russians, and Italians. 86 The Allies had already divided the spoils. The Russ ians were to get part of Turkey (an ally of Germany), France would get part of Germany’ s Saar Basin. France and Britain would divide up Germany’s African colonies and most of Turkey’s Middle-East  8 3 T h e c o m p l e t e t e x t o f t h e w a r - d e c l a r a t i o n s p e e c h i s a t I n f o P l e a s e ( h t t p : / / w w w . i n f o p l e a s e . c o m / i p a / A 0 9 0 0 1 4 4 . h t m l ) . 8 4 T h e H u m a n C o m e d y b y J a m e s H a r v e y R o b i n s o n ( 1 9 3 7 ) , c h a p t e r 9 ; q u o t e d i n B a r t l e t t ’ s F a m i l i a r Q u o t a t i o n s , 1 5 t h e d i t i o n , p a g e 8 6 6 . 8 5 T h e f u l l t e x t o f t h e “ F o u r t e e n P o i n t s ” s p e e c h i s i n t h e B r i g h a m Y o u n g U n i v e r s i t y l i b r a r y ( h t t p : / / w w w . l i b . b y u . e d u / ~ r d h / w w i / 1 9 1 8 / 1 4 p o i n t s . h t m l ) . 8 6 A P e a c e t o E n d A l l P e a c e b y D a v i d F r o m k i n , p a g e 2 5 7 ."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 49 possessions. Japan was to get Germany’s Far East co lonies, even including the Shantung peninsula in China. Italy was promised Trieste and part of Austria. 87 Wilson kept this information from the American peop le. At one point in 1919 he told a group of senators that he had just learned of the s ecret agreements. 88 This was an audacious lie, because the Russian Communists had p ublicized the secret treaties immediately upon seizing power in November 1917, an d were then reprinted in newspapers in the United States and England. 89 As journalist Walter Lippmann said, “Only a dunce c ould have been ignorant of the secret treaties.” 90 Self-Determination for Everyone Rosy Promise & Lie: The war will be fought to assure self-determinatio n for all the peoples of the earth. Three months before his call for a declaration of w ar, Wilson gave his “Peace without Victory” speech, in which he demanded self-determin ation for all people: No peace can last, or ought to last, which does not recognize and accept the principle that governments derive all their just po wers from the consent of the governed, and that no right anywhere exists to hand peoples about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property . . . . Any peace which does not recognize and accept this principle will inevit ably be upset. It will not rest upon the affections or the convictions of mankind. The ferment of spirit of whole populations will fight subtly and constantly against it, and all the world will sympathize. 91  8 7 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e s 1 0 0 - 1 0 1 . 8 8 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 4 0 7 . 8 9 R u s s i a L e a v e s t h e W a r b y G e o r g e F .

Any peace that neglected self-determination would assure another war. But in practice the statement was a plain lie. As w e’ve seen, the Allies had already divided territories among themselves — with no rega rd for the wishes of the people who lived in them. For example, the Allies lured Italy out of its alliance with Germany by promising Italy it could have parts of the Austrian Tyrol and the Adriatic Coast. 92 Even if Wilson didn’t know of the secret agreements, he should be condemn ed for his cavalier handling of the matter. The Allies were de sperate to get America into the war, and would have done anything to involve the U.S. But Wi lson didn’t even ask for conditions or commitments from the Allies before plunging America into war. Nor did he ask whether the Allies had made any decisions regarding the pos twar world. Thus whether Wilson was ignorant of the truth or he simply didn’t care, his promise of self-determination was as empty as a promise to eradicate sin. But he wasn’t ignorant, he was lying. He knew he wa s asking Americans to ally themselves with British and French empires containi ng hundreds of millions of unwilling subjects. The British empire was the largest the world had ev er known. When the war began the empire included 444 million people, very few of who m had the right to vote. 93 One reason Britain desperately needed America’s hel p in the war was that over a million British soldiers were tied up keeping the e mpire’s subjects in line — and thus were unavailable to fight in Europe. 94 Japan, another ally, had been oppressing the Korean people since 1905. When Wilson made his Fourteen Points speech in January 1918, ma ssive Korean demonstrations celebrated what they inferred was Wilson’s promise of independence to come at the end of the war. Japanese troops attacked the demonstrators — killing over 7,000 people and wounding at least twice that many. But Wilson never showed any interest in self- determination for the Koreans. 95 In fact, he never actually did anything to bring about self-determination for anyone . But throughout the war and even afterward, he kept chattering on about self- determination and referring to the Germans as “impe rialists” — paying no attention to the  9 2 T h e C a u s e s o f W o r l d W a r I b y S t e w a r t R o s s , p a g e 5 4 . 9 3 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 6 3 . 9 4 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 1 8 7 . 9 5 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 3 7 2 ."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 51 imperial possessions of his Allies. The freedom and self-determination he talked about obviously didn’t apply to the hundreds of millions of people ruled against their will by the British, French, Japanese, and Russians. The German People Are our Friends Lie: The war is against the German government, not the German people. In his war-declaration speech, Wilson said: We have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering this war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval. 96 He said he was going to liberate the German people from oppression. But he wholeheartedly supported the British blockade that eventually starved to death several hundred thousand Germans. And once the war had begun, he demonized the German people as often as he castigated their leaders. He implied that the Germa ns had “filled our communities with vicious spies and conspirators.” These people were seeking “to undermine the [U.S.] Government with false professions of loyalty to its principles.” 97 In several speeches, Wilson pushed the theme of a “ war without hate.” But the war was prosecuted in the most hateful manner possible. Ger mans were portrayed as despicable — and, as we’ll see in the next chapter, German-Ameri cans in the U.S. were harassed and victimized by private vigilantes with Wilson’s enco uragement.

In his war-declaration speech, Wilson said: I advise that the Congress declare the recent cours e of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war agai nst the government and people of the United States; . . . 98 This allegation referred to Germany’s submarine war fare. But that was no more a “war against the government and people of the United Sta tes” than the British blockade that forcibly prevented goods from America (or anywhere else) from reaching Germany was a “war against the government and people of the Unite d States.” The Germans were merely assuring that no munitions or other military supplies would reach their enemy. Meanwhile, the British were assu ring that no supplies of any kind — not even food — would reach anyone in Germany. Because Americans knew very little about American m unitions going to Britain or about the British blockade of Germany, most people accepted Wilson’s allegations at face value. They assumed that the sinking of American sh ips in the war zone must have been part of a German plan to attack America. A Just peace Rosy Promise: A just peace will be available to all the nations. In his “Peace without Victory” speech to the Senate on January 22, 1917, Wilson said: . . . first of all, . . . it must be a peace withou t victory. . . . Victory would mean peace forced upon the loser, a victor’s terms impos ed upon the vanquished. It would be accepted in humiliation, under duress, at an intolerable sacrifice, and would leave a sting, a resentment, a bitter memory upon which terms of peace would rest, not permanently, but only as upon quick sand.

But when Pope Benedict proposed a peaceful sett lement, Wilson rejected it out of hand — implying that the Germans must be taught a lesson they would never forget. The eventual peace, fashioned with Wilson’s complia nce, was a traditional “victor’s justice” — imposing the harshest, most humiliating terms upon the losers. Rosy Promise: Not Much Need for U.S. Troops Rosy promise: The U.S. military’s manpower needs will be slight, and very few troops will go to Europe. With the declaration of war, Wilson asked Congress for 500,000 new recruits for the armed forces. But he gave the impression that Ameri can soldiers wouldn’t actually fight in the war — that the war status would merely allow th e government to give taxpayer money legally to the Allies. He said: What this will involve is clear. It will involve th e utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governme nts now at war with Germany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credit, in order that our re sources may so far as possible be added to theirs. 100 On April 4, 1917, two days after Wilson’s speech, C . W. Gilbert of the New York Tribune wrote that it was “nonsensical” to think that any s ubstantial quantity of American troops would have to go to Europe. 101 The next day the Los Angeles Times echoed this thought, saying “what the Allies need in Europe is not men but munitions.” 102 This idea  9 9 T h e c o m p l e t e t e x t o f t h e “ P e a c e w i t h o u t V i c t o r y ” s p e e c h i s a v a i l a b l e a t t h e P B S w e b s i t e ( h t t p : / / w w w . p b s . o r g / w g b h / a m e x / w i l s o n / f i l m m o r e / f m _ v i c t o r y . h t m l ) . 1 0 0 T h e c o m p l e t e t e x t o f t h e w a r - d e c l a r a t i o n s p e e c h i s a t I n f o P l e a s e ( h t t p : / / w w w . i n f o p l e a s e . c o m / i p a / A 0 9 0 0 1 4 4 . h t m l ) . 1 0 1 F i v e D a y s t o W a r : A p r i l 2 - 6 , 1 9 1 7 b y R .

But once America was in the war, the hard realities came to light. Germans Winning the War By 1916 the Germans had gained the upper hand in th e war. They had routed the Russian armies in the East and were inflicting into lerable casualties on Britain and France in the West. 105 But Allied censorship and Germany’s inability to co mmunicate directly with America had left most Americans — even Woodrow Wilson — ign orant of the way the war was going.

Had he known how far the Allies had fallen, he could have exacted firm commitments from them to help fulfill the rosy prom ises he was making to the American people. Instead, as soon as America entered the war, the Br itish and French told Wilson that the Germans were winning, that both France and Engl and were on the brink of financial collapse, and that America must finance the whole w ar from here on in. German submarines were now sinking almost every supply shi p headed for England. 106 Journalist Phillip Knightley summed up the situatio n as follows: In [1917], . . . Italy suffered her overwhelming de feat at Caporetto, England was within six weeks of starvation, there were muti nies in the French army, . . . France was virtually finished and the g overnment, it was said, had secretly fixed November 1, 1917, as France’s last d ay if the United States had not entered the war by then. 107 General John J. Pershing went to Europe to investig ate conditions. He found the Allies completely routed. One French attack had been thoro ughly defeated with 120,000 French casualties — a defeat that sparked a major mutiny i n the French army and a rebellion against the government. French soldiers and civilia ns were fed up with the war and ready to throw in the towel. The rebellion subsided only on the news that American troops were coming to defeat the hated Germans. 108 The fact that Germany was close to winning didn’t m ean it was about to conquer Europe — or even that it would take much territory from the French, Russians, and Italians. Unlike Nazi Germany of 1939-1941, which was able to occupy a large part of Europe, the Germans of 1917 had fought an expensive and exhaust ing war. It didn’t have the troops to occupy its neighbors or enforce punitive reparation s. But the Germans could have demanded an armistice restoring all the prewar Euro pean boundaries. In fact, Germany had been offering the British and French an armistice, but the British refused because they hoped the U.S. would enter the war and save their hides. 109  1 0 6 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 9 9 . 1 0 7 T h e F i r s t C a s u a l t y b y P h i l l i p K n i g h t l e y , p a g e 1 3 0 . 1 0 8 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e s 1 1 4 - 1 1 5 . 1 0 9 A P e a c e t o E n d A l l P e a c e b y D a v i d F r o m k i n , p a g e 2 3 6 ."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 56 The American people had no knowledge that the Allie s were near defeat.

And he was embarrassed t o discover, immediately after the declaration of war, that the war would be lost unle ss the U.S. invested billions of dollars and millions of soldiers. The Pope’s Proposal Shortly after the U.S. entered the war, Pope Benedi ct XV proposed an armistice, based on terms similar to those Wilson had outlined in hi s war speech. Even though they were winning the war, the Germans and Austrians welcomed the Pope’s proposal. But the English flatly rejected it ; they believed American help would lead to an Allied victory and the ability to impose hars h peace terms on Germany. 110 The Allies let Wilson answer for all of them, givin g him the burden of refusing the Pope’s request. In his best war-without-hate mode, he wrote what was the perhaps the longest single sentence of the entire war, if not t he century: The object of this war is to deliver the free peopl es of the world from the menace of a vast military establishment controlled by an irresponsible government, which, having secretly planned to domin ate the world, proceeded to carry the plan out without regard either to the sacred obligation of treaty or the long established practices and long cherished p rinciples of international action and honor, which chose its own time for the war, delivered its blow fiercely and suddenly, stopped at no barrier either of law or mercy, swept a whole continent within the tide of blood, not the b lood of soldiers only, but the blood of innocent women and children and also of th e helpless poor, and now stands balked but not defeated, the enemy of four f ifths of the world. 111 Translation: No dice.

No evidence ever surfaced to indicate that Germany intended to turn France, Russia, Belgium, or England into German territories. • That Germany “secretly planned to dominate the worl d.” It had neither the manpower nor the resources to do such a thing. • That Germany had violated the ”long established pra ctices and long cherished principles of international action and ho nor.” • That Germany had chosen “its own time for the war.” It was drawn into war by the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the Austrian government’s retaliatory belligerence, and the fran tic rearming by all the major European nations. • That Germany “stopped at no barrier either of law o r mercy, swept a whole continent within the tide of blood, not the blood o f soldiers only, but the blood of innocent women and children and also of th e helpless poor.” The claims of German atrocities had long since been ref uted. • That Germany now stood “balked.” It was wining the war, as even Woodrow Wilson knew by then. • That Germany was “the enemy of four fifths of the w orld.” Had that been so, Germany couldn’t have been winning the war. Changing the Course of History The war would have been over by the summer of 1917 if the U.S. had simply stayed out. Even though they had the upper hand, the Germa ns and Austrians were eager for an armistice in order to end the British blockade. Even after the U.S. entered the war, the fighting c ould have been ended immediately if Wilson had simply accepted the Pope’s proposal — wh ich provided for the very terms that Wilson had demanded. Neither Britain, France, Russi a, nor Italy would have continued fighting if Wilson had accepted the Pope’s proposal . U.S. entry kept the war going for another 18 months , killing hundreds of thousands more soldiers and civilians, including over 100,000 Americans. This added carnage was the product of Woodrow Wilso n’s ambition for a new world order of peace and security, and his lying to the A merican people to get his way. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 58 To Wilson, the deaths of hundreds of thousands was a small price for the glorious new world that he knew he could build. The dead would j ust be what has come to be known as “collateral damage.” After all, “you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.” But those who say this never intend to break their own eggs; it’s always someone else who must be sacrificed. And, even with the broken e ggs, the omelet never materializes. Wilson’s blundering — supported by his lies, false promises, and wartime propaganda — affected history for the worse. Not only did the blundering cause untold death and devastation directly, it caused the two most catastrophic events of the 20th century — the rise of Communism and the rise of Nazism. THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION Just before America entered the war — on March 13, 1917 — Czar Nicholas of Russia abdicated his throne in the face of a nationwide re volution. The new government, headed by Prince George Lvov, continued the war against Ge rmany and Austria. Lvov resigned in July and was replaced by Alexander Kerensky, who al so kept Russia in the war. 112 The Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was living in e xile in Switzerland. He promised the Germans he would take Russia out of the war if they would help him seize power in Russia. With Germany already on the verge of victor y and no America in the war, the Germans had little reason to accept Lenin’s proposa l. But America’s entry into the war made the outcome f ar chancier for the Germans. So they gave Lenin the money to buy the weapons and ot her resources necessary for a coup. 113 On November 7, 1917, the Communists succeeded in t aking over the Russian government. Lenin immediately made good on his promise and with drew Russia from the war. 114 The Communists couldn’t have gained control of Russ ia without German help. They had no resources and little following. 115 But with German money they succeeded.  1 1 2 S p a r t a c u s E d u c a t i o n a l ( h t t p : / / w w w . s p a r t a c u s . s c h o o l n e t . c o . u k / R U S k e r e n s k y . h t m ) . 1 1 3 U t o p i a i n P o w e r : T h e H i s t o r y o f t h e S o v i e t U n i o n f r o m 1 9 1 7 t o t h e P r e s e n t b y M i k h a i l H e l l e r a n d A l e k s a n d r M .

It was their license to force centralized control upon the American economy. Wartime propaganda: Centralized economic control is winning the war. In Woodrow Wilson’s war-declaration speech, he said the war effort . . . . . . will involve the organization and mobilizatio n of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and s erve the incidental needs of the Nation in the most abundant and yet the most ec onomical and efficient way possible. 116 Directing the entire economy from a central command post was an attractive notion to people who disdained free markets and private prope rty, and who saw the implications for postwar America. If government could mobilize and i mprove the economy in wartime, why not have it do the same in peacetime? It could elim inate poverty, improve health care, expand educational opportunities, increase the avai lability of consumer goods, lower prices, and make life better for all. World War I was a good test of government economic control, even if the test results were seldom read honestly.

A s historians George H. Mayer and Walter O. Forster pointed out, Baruch’s powers were far-reaching: The elastic powers conferred on Baruch as chairman of the War Industries Board made him a dictator over large areas of the w ar economy. His authority to establish priorities on all materials except agr icultural commodities gave him life-and-death power over business. If a manufa cturer refused to convert from the production of horseshoes to trench shovels, Baruch could cut off his supplies of iron and shut down his asse mbly lines. He could even commandeer the plant for the government and op erate it. In cooperation with the price-fixing committee, he cou ld exercise further leverage by setting the prices of raw materials at wholesale. 118 Before the war was over, the government had confisc ated the telephone, telegraph, and ocean shipping industries, all the railroads, and h undreds of factories. Price controls were imposed on practically all products. And the govern ment had acquired new regulatory powers that it would continue to exercise after the war. The government prohibited unions from striking in a ny industry remotely related to the war. It intervened in hundreds of labor disputes. 119 Even in the first few years after the war, Army troops patrolled the streets in many mini ng towns. 120 Some economic controls were lifted after the war, o thers lived on.

Wartime propaganda: The American economic war machine is overwhelming the enemy. When America entered the war in 1917, Woodrow Wilso n established the Committee on Public Information to tell “the truth” to the Am erican people.

Trucks arrived without motors, wagons without wheels. 127 In addition, the troops received shiploads of unreq uested material that was useless for war — book cases, bath tubs, cuspidors, floor wax, step ladders, lawn mowers, refrigerators, safes, settees, sickles, window shad es, and other items of no value to soldiers. 128 During the winter of 1917-1918, U.S. soldiers in Fr ance had no cold-weather clothes. The government decided that the military trainees a t home needed the warm clothing more. 129 A Congressional delegation visiting the front found that the troops were eating terrible food and didn’t have proper weapons. 130 By December 1917, the government’s Shipping Board h ad spent $500 million but hadn’t launched a single ship.

Early in 1918 Wilson’s Committee on Public Informat ion released a picture-filled story proudly announcing that “The first American-built b attle planes are today en route to the front in France.” But only one such plane had been built, and not even that one was ready for combat.

He explained the real reason for w artime censorship: no government imposes censorship to keep vital information from t he enemy, but to keep the truth about military mismanagement and failure from its own pub lic . But Pegler’s report could reach the United States o nly via the British cable, and the British censors killed it. 140 The Balance Sheet Myth: Federal control of the economy won the war. Despite the government’s abysmal failure at economi c management, this idea survived the war. And it eased the way for new government pr ograms to be enacted in the 1920s — such things as federal public works projects, feder al loan guarantees, and farm price supports. 141 America’s entry into the war did tip the balance to the Allies and brought about Germany’s defeat. But this was because by 1917 Amer ica was the only major country still intact. All the other participants were nearly exha usted — running low on money, cannon fodder, and the will to fight.

The Committee on Public Information produced a stea dy flow of stories of our brave boys overseas fighting to protect democracy for eve ryone by destroying the dreaded Huns — and other governments did the same. The truth, however, was something quite different. Morale in every country was very poor and a grave problem for all governments. Despi te propaganda about soldiers marching proudly to war to fight for God and country, every warring nation had to conscript the necessary cannon fodder. One purpose of hate propaganda is to inspire soldie rs to kill without mercy. But those at the front still fraternized with the enemy when they could. Most of the war was fought from opposing trenches o nly a hundred yards or so apart. And sometimes soldiers on opposing sides were able to act on the kinship they felt for each other. For example, the soldiers themselves defied their g overnments and declared battlefield truces at Christmas 1914. British and German soldie rs conversed, played soccer, and sang together. Over the next two years, similar incident s occurred in many areas — often during lulls between offensives. Afterward, the troops wou ld go back to killing each other. 151 Even the French, who seemed to hate all things Germ an, joined in the fraternization.

Desertions & Mutinies Far more critical were the desertions and mutinies by soldiers. About 350,000 Italian soldiers (roughly 6% of the t otal army) were tried for military crimes during the war. Many were tried in absentia because they’d deserted and disappeared, but thousands received prison sentence s, and at least 750 were executed by their own government. In October 1917 in the battle of Caporetto, almost 300,000 Italian soldiers surrendered rather than risk death. Another 350,000 discarded t heir rifles and ran for home. In September 1917, several thousand British troops in the Étaples region rioted against their commanders — immobilizing about 100,000 soldi ers in the process. By war’s end, over 300,000 British soldiers had bee n court-martialed and over 300 were executed. Many soldiers surrendered to the ene my as a legal way of deserting. Meanwhile, the British press saluted these prisoner s as heroes. 152 During the first eight months of 1917, over 700,000 Russian soldiers deserted. 153 The U.S. army had similar problems. While the Commi ttee on Public Information was issuing glowing reports of heroic deeds, 100,000 Am erican soldiers were fleeing their divisions. General John Pershing ordered his office rs to shoot any man who ran. 154 In every country, censorship kept news of the deser tions, riots, and mutinies from the public until long after the war. An exception occurred in France in April 1917, howe ver, when 120,000 French soldiers were slaughtered in a failed French offens ive. The survivors mutinied and were joined by a majority of the French army. The civili an population learned of the mutiny when one division marched on Paris, shouting “Down with the war” and trying to overthrow the government. The soldiers returned to their outfits only when they heard that  1 5 2 C e n t u r y o f W a r b y G a b r i e l K o l k o , p a g e s 1 3 5 - 1 3 6 . 1 5 3 C e n t u r y o f W a r b y G a b r i e l K o l k o , p a g e 1 4 2 . 1 5 4 P e r s o n a l i t i e s a n d R e m i n i s c e n c e s o f t h e W a r b y G e n e r a l R o b e r t L e e B u l l a r d , p a g e 2 4 9 ; c i t e d i n T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 2 7 1 ."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 70 the Americans were coming to help.

Unfortunately, liberty was in short supply in World War I. On June 15, 1917, two months after America entered the war, President Wilson signed the Espionage Act — a law passed supposedly to pros ecute spying, 156 but actually used to jail anti-war dissidents. Lie: The Espionage Act will be enforced only against tre asonous actions or “willfully false” statements. The politicians assured the public that the Espiona ge Act respected American liberties. The law even exempted from prosecution “any discuss ion, comment, or criticism of the acts or policies of the Government.” 157 But it is always foolish to rely on promises from politicians — even assurances in writing — or to th ink that any law will not be expanded once it’s on the books. Despite its title, the law was designed to suppress anti-war sentiment. It authorized 20 years in prison for . . . whoever, when the United States is at war, shall wi llfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refus al of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States or shall willfull y obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the U.S. . . . 158  1 5 5 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e s 1 1 4 - 1 1 5 . 1 5 6 “ E s p i o n a g e A c t o f 1 9 1 7 , ” M i c r o s o f t E n c a r t a R e f e r e n c e L i b r a r y 2 0 0 3 . 1 5 7 A P e o p l e ’ s H i s t o r y o f t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s b y H o w a r d Z i n n , p a g e 3 6 5 . 1 5 8 S t a t u e 5 5 3 , M a y 1 6 , 1 9 1 8 ; c i t e d i n T h e C a p t i v e P r e s s b y T e d G a l e n C a r p e n t e r , p a g e s 2 3 - 2 4 ."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 71 In May 1918 Congress passed the Sedition Act, an am endment to the Espionage Act, which prohibited disloyal, profane, or abusive rema rks about the American form of government, the flag, or the military uniform, as w ell as any language that hindered the war effort in any way. As journalist Walter Karp said: Nothing was to be said or read in America that Wils on himself might find disagreeable. Nothing was to be said or read in Ame rica that cast doubt on the nobility of Wilson’s goals, the sublimity of his mo tives, or the efficacy of his statecraft.

J.H. Ellis, a poor Negro preacher in Arkansas, was convicted when a personal enemy claimed that Ellis had uttered anti-war statements. The Civil Liberties Bureau took on his case and managed to get him freed after three month s. But on the night he was released, a vigilante mob beat him mercilessly, held him captiv e, and then ran him out of town. 164 Hollywood producer Robert Goldstein’s movie, The Spirit of ’76, premiered in the summer of 1917. The film included atrocities commit ted by British troops during the Revolutionary War (similar to those portrayed in Me l Gibson’s The Patriot in 2000). Goldstein was arrested, convicted, and served three years in prison for, as the judge said, encouraging people to “question the good faith of o ur ally Great Britain.” The politicians had assured Americans that only “wi llfully false” statements would be prosecuted, but the Court of Appeals said that the truth or falsity of the incidents portrayed in the movie “was not the essence of the inquiry.” 165 The case was officially titled U.S. vs. The Spirit of ’76 . 166 A more apt title would be hard to find.

Despite the title “Espionage Act,” there wasn’t a single conviction of an enemy agent or spy . 179 Woodrow Wilson said, “The world must be made safe f or democracy.” 180 But democracy wasn’t safe in the United States. Men wer e drafted against their will, the government’s powers expanded and the individual’s l iberties contracted, and anyone who criticized government policy could be sent to priso n — just as in any dictatorship. The Draft Opposition to the war often focused on the military draft — the conscription of unwilling young men who would be forced to kill or be killed in the trenches of Europe. Lie, propaganda, & myth: America’s young men are eager to fight and die to make the world safe for democracy. In his war-declaration speech, Wilson said “the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.” 181 But not many Americans embraced the privilege of spending their blood. Wilson asked for 500,000 new recruits, and Congress immediately upped the ante — calling for 1,000,000 men to enlist. But after six weeks, only 73,000 had volunteered. The Akron Beacon-Journal editorialized that the country had “never embarked upon a more unpopular war.” So on May 18, 1917, Congress cured the manpower shortage by authorizing a military draft. 182 The draft was eminently unpopular. By the end of th e war, over 330,000 men had been labeled as “draft evaders.” 183 (Contrary to Wilson’s original estimate, 4,744,000 men were mobilized by war’s end.) 184    1 7 8 “ C i v i l L i b e r t i e s D u r i n g W o r l d W a r I ” b y E r i c S c o t t R o y c e , S o u t h e r n L i b e r t a r i a n R e v i e w , A p r i l 1 9 7 6 , p a g e 8 ; c i t e d i n T h e W a r m o n g e r s b y H o w a r d S .

But while he thought that young men were privileged to spend blood (theirs, not his) for his principles, the young men didn’t see it quite that way.

He wanted such laws imposed in peacetime as well. 194 By 1920, every government that had gone to war had granted amnesty to its political prisoners — every one, that is, except Woodrow Wils on’s. 195 In January 1921, Eugene Debs, still in prison, was close to death. Attorney General Mitchell Palmer asked Wilson to commute Debs’ sente nce, but Wilson refused, saying: While the flower of American youth was pouring out its blood to vindicate the cause of civilization, this man, Debs, stood behind the lines, sniping, attacking, and denouncing them. . . . This man was a traitor t o his country and he will never be pardoned during my administration. 196 In other words, you’re attacking American youth if you don’t want them to be killed in a needless war. Americans have heard that refrain o ver and over, in war after war. Two months later, Warren Harding replaced Wilson as President, and on Christmas Day of 1921 he pardoned Eugene V. Debs and 23 other anti-war protesters. 197 Harding said: I couldn’t do anything else. . . . Those fellows di dn’t mean any harm. It was a cruel punishment. 198 There was no general amnesty, however, and the figh t to release the remaining prisoners continued.

In March a German offensive moved to within 50 mile s of Paris. 215 But American forces finally joined the battle that summer, and they turned the tide.

The mid-term Congressional elections were just a mo nth away, and being soft on Germany was as politically dangerous as being soft on communism or terrorism became in later years. The only safe political position was t o demand nothing less than “unconditional surrender.” Major American newspapers condemned the peace propo sal. The Senate “debated” it for two hours, but not one Senator spoke in its fav or. They all wanted to see Germany crushed before any peace negotiations could begin. 222 To satisfy the blood lust, politicians and journali sts were quite willing to let thousands more people — including American soldiers — die or be maimed.  2 1 8 T h e G e r m a n H i g h C o m m a n d a t W a r b y R o b e r t B .

In fact, few Americans knew about th e blockade even during the war, since Americans were prevented from hearing any news that might cast the British in a bad light.

What we do know is that he willingly repudiated nearly every promise he had made, every principle he espoused, and every high- minded reason he had given for going to war. His first misstep was to go to Paris himself to neg otiate with the Allies. Many of his advisors warned against it; they wanted an experien ced negotiator to represent the U.S. But Wilson was sure his charisma could get him anything he wanted from anyone. For the U.S. delegation, he chose only yes-men. 241 He saw no need for people who understood European history and ethnic interests, b ecause he had the solution for all the ills of the world. When the peace conference opened, he told the Allie d leaders not to confiscate Germany’s colonies — that the colonies should becom e League of Nations trusteeships as a prelude to independence. He even suggested that his new world order might require breaking up the British empire. And he opposed puni tive reparations payments. 242 The Allies were neither amused nor persuaded. They were vultures eager to pick the meat off the b ones of the German corpse. To make matters worse, during the negotiations Wils on suffered what was probably a small stroke, causing his face to twitch. His docto r, who was with Wilson in Paris because of the latter’s poor health, announced that it was a mere case of flu. But those around him noticed a profound difference in his personality. 243 The “Just Peace” & The League of Nations Myth: Wilson negotiated a just peace that could have cre ated a better world, if only the U.S. Senate hadn’t rejected his work. In fact, Wilson didn’t negotiate a just peace.

He persuaded the Allies to treat the peace treaty and the League as a single p ackage — thinking the Allies would agree to the League in order to complete the treaty. 244 But just the opposite happened. The Allies didn’t c are about the League. So whenever Wilson objected to a treaty provision, they threate ned to stay out of the League, and Wilson backed down. He gave in — on point after point after point. 245 He was maneuvered into dropping his demands for sel f-determination or a “peace without victory.” He eventually allowed the Allies to confiscate German colonies and take large chunks of Germany’s homeland — with no regard for the wishes of the people affected. Whatever the topic, Wilson would assert that it was a matter of principle on which he couldn’t possibly compromise. Then he’d abandon the principle for the sake of the League. 246 The “just peace” just died. Secrecy Rosy promise: No more secret negotiations among governments.

Only a peace between equals can last, on ly a peace the very principle of which is equality and a common partici pation in a common benefit. 252 The words made great sense, but the actual treaty h e agreed to was the complete opposite of them.

For example, British Prime Minister Lloyd George de manded that Germany pay reparations to the Allies of 24 billion British pou nds (roughly $1.8 trillion in today’s money). 253 Wilson agreed, of course. GERMAN GUILT To justify imposing harsh terms on the German peopl e, the Allies promoted the fiction that Germany alone had caused the Great War. Postwar lie and continuing Myth: German aggression was solely responsible for World War I. Wilson had already said that no one country was to blame for the war. Needless to say, he dropped that position as well. So the peace trea ty included a Preface fixing the entire blame for the war on Germany.

In 1914 resentments abounded in Europe. France had attacked the German state of Prussia in 1871. The Germans won the war fairly quickly and took the French districts of Als ace and Lorraine as war prizes. For 40 years, the French craved revenge and retrieval. 254 Just two years before World War I, Serbia, Monteneg ro, Bulgaria, and Greece fought Turkey — and then Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, Roman ia, and Turkey fought Bulgaria. 255 These wars left their own resentments. Maneuvering for power never stopped. Russia was try ing to unite all the Slavic states in the Balkans — while Germany was afraid such a un ion would leave itself nearly surrounded by potential enemies. 256 Fearing what France or Russia might do, Germany, Au stria-Hungary, and Italy formed the Triple Alliance, pledging to come to each other ’s aid in time of war. In response, France, Britain, and Russia formed the Triple Enten te (“three-way understanding”). All these nations had treaties with smaller nations as well. 257 Italy later switched sides when the Allies promised Italy part of Austria. Such alliances almost guaranteed that any small war would erupt into a large war. So Germany, France, England, and Russia were all build ing up their military machines. Each had an offensive strategy to bring about a quick vi ctory in the war that seemed inevitable. 258 Woodrow Wilson’s close friend and advisor Colonel E dward House toured Europe two months before the war started in 1914.

If it hadn’t been this, it would have been something else. In fact, Lawrence Lafore title d his book on the origins of the war The Long Fuse . 260 This was nothing new. War had been Europe’s pastime for centuries — through the Spanish armada, the rise of the British empire, the Napoleonic wars, and much more. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson implored Ame ricans not to be dragged into these perpetual wars through alliances with Europea n states. As Jefferson said: I have ever deemed it fundamental for the United St ates never to take active part in the quarrels of Europe. Their political int erests are entirely distinct from ours. Their mutual jealousies, their balance o f power, their complicated alliances, their forms and principles of government , are all foreign to us. They are nations of eternal war. 261 A hundred years later, nothing had changed. Not onl y were the Allies ready to fight the Central Powers, they were ready to fight each other . Even while the war was raging, the British and French were scheming in secret to thwar t their Russian allies, while the French and Russians were scheming in secret to thwart the British, and the British were prepared to go to war with Russia over Constantinople after the war with Germany. 262 Alliances came and went like junior high school rom ances, with allies becoming enemies and enemies becoming allies. Prior to 1901, for example, England regarded Germany as its most important ally, while Russia an d France were its natural enemies. 263 It was only when Germany became an important commer cial rival to England that the friendliness toward Germany evaporated.  2 5 9 T h e I n t i m a t e P a p e r s o f C o l o n e l H o u s e , v o l u m e I , e d i t e d b y C h a r l e s S e y m o u r , p a g e 2 4 9 . 2 6 0 “ I n t r o d u c t i o n ” b y H e n r y M .

Wartime propaganda and subsequent myth: Kaiser Wilhelm was a war- making autocrat. From the outset of war in Europe in 1914, America w as flooded with propaganda depicting Kaiser Wilhelm as a sadistic butcher. However, before the war the Kaiser had been well-re spected throughout the world. On June 8, 1913, just 14 months before the war star ted, the New York Times commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Kaiser’s c oronation with a glowing front-page article. The author said the Kaiser had prevented w ar in Europe and referred to him as “the greatest factor for peace that our time can show.” The article included tributes to the Kaiser from prominent Americans. 268 But one year later, politicians and newspapers in B ritain and America were accusing him of trying to rule the world by making war on al l civilized people. The anti-Kaiser propaganda never suggested that the Kaiser had changed. The accusations implied that the Kaiser and the Germans had always been this way — unrepentant savages, “Prussian militarists,” and so on — ignoring all the praise that had been lavished on the Kaiser just a year before.

They acquitted him of any blame for starting the war — pointing out the real factors that had set Europe on fire. 269 That Germany could have avoided becoming involved i n World War I is certainly true. The Kaiser by himself could have kept Germany out o f it. We can all wish he had done so — and he must have recognized his mistakes before t he war was over. In the end, he saw the destruction of the German economy, saw millions of Germans killed, and was chased off his throne. But everyone in power in each of the belligerent na tions was just as thoughtless, just as insensitive to death and destruction, just as over- confident, just as guilty. Morgenthau’s Story The only evidence offered of German guilt was a sto ry told in the memoirs of Henry Morgenthau, Sr., who had been the U.S. ambassador t o Turkey in 1914.

Morgenthau claimed the German ambassador to Turkey told him that the Kaiser had met with German industrialists, bankers, generals, and admirals one week after the Sarajevo assassination.

They came to the conclu sion that: The documents do not permit any attributing, to any government or nation, a premeditated desire for European war in 1914.

There was enough guilt to go around, but it all lan ded on Germany. 275  2 7 4 A P e a c e t o E n d A l l P e a c e b y D a v i d F r o m k i n , p a g e 2 3 6 . 2 7 5 G e n e s i s o f t h e W a r b y H a r r y E l m e r B a r n e s ; a n d T h e O r i g i n s o f t h e W o r l d W a r b y S i d n e y B .

Just like many American Presidents, he knew what wa s best for everyone — even the whole world — and he believed the power of his voic e and the strength of his convictions could overcome centuries of animosity, fear, and hu nger for revenge. Wilson took that faith in himself to Paris and was taken to the cleaners by the Allies. When he recognized the price to be paid for his Lea gue of Nations, he heartily endorsed the concept of German guilt. 276 The Germans were guilty for one reason only: they l ost the war. THE TREATY IS COMPLETED The peace treaty was completed in April 1919 — five months after the end of the war. It went on for 76,000 words — as long as this book. 277 Wilson had promised the Germans a treaty based on h is “Fourteen Points,” but the final draft discarded nearly every one of those points. The treaty was delivered to the Germans, who were s hocked to learn that there would be no negotiations — just an order to sign the trea ty or the blockade on Germany would be expanded. 278 No Mercy Woodrow Wilson is considered a man of peace by many historians, because they look at his public statements and not at his actions.  2 7 6 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 3 8 1 . 2 7 7 T h e c o m p l e t e t r e a t y i s a v a i l a b l e a t h t t p : / / h i s t o r y . a c u s d . e d u / g e n / t e x t / v e r s a i l l e s t r e a t y / v e r c o n t e n t s . h t m l . 2 7 8 T h e O r d e a l o f W o o d r o w W i l s o n b y H e r b e r t H o o v e r , p a g e s 2 3 3 - 2 3 8 ."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 100 Rosy promise: The peace will be equitable, just, and without win ners and losers.

The treaty took from Germany all its colonies, 13% of its homeland, 12% of its population, and nearly half its iron production. 282 Poland received a corridor, in places as much as 14 0 miles wide, that split Germany from north to south.

Even so, 60% voted to remain with Germany . The Allies ignored the vote and partitioned the area — giving Poland 60% of it, inc luding virtually all the coal, iron, zinc, and lead-mining districts. 284 France retrieved Alsace-Lorraine from Germany, and took the Cameroons and Togoland in Africa. 285 France also got the right for 15 years to occupy b oth the German Rhineland and the Saar basin with its coal mines.

When the French government demanded a payment of $3 00 million from Germany and Austria, it toppled the first in a long row of domi nos. As Germany moved nearer to economic collapse, Europeans repatriated their gold deposits at U.S. banks and sold their stocks in New York, and European governments defaul ted on their debts to America. 314 Second, The groundwork was laid for eventual German revenge — organized by Adolf Hitler. False expectation: The treaty’s provisions will remain in force perma nently. The New York Times said: The punishment Germany must endure for centuries will be one of the greatest deterrents to the war spirit. 315 [italics added] Wilson said the treaty’s terms were needed to keep Germany “in chains that could not be broken.” 316 Instead, of course, the chains were so terrible tha t the German people were willing to entrust their country to a thug named Adolf Hitler, who broke the chains within two decades after the treaty was signed. When the peace treaty was completed in 1919, Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, head of the German delegation, told the German press corps: The Fatherland has been dealt a heavy blow.

Americans had just fought such a war, and doing it again wasn’t a popular idea. In addition, the notion of the League as the guardi an of peace struck many Senators as unrealistic. Senator William Borah of Idaho said: The proposition is force to destroy force, conflict to prevent conflict, militarism to destroy militarism, war to prevent wa r. 327 Several of Wilson’s subordinates testified against the treaty. William Bullitt said he resigned in disgust from the American delegation to the peace conference after reading the treaty. He added that the Secretary of State and ot her members of the American delegation opposed many provisions in the treaty. 328 And, just as in Paris, Wilson insisted that the Sen ate consider the treaty and the League of Nations as a single, indivisible matter. This me ant that the final restoration of peace could come only if the Senate accepted the League.

Historians, journalists, and citizens began to wond er why America had fought in the Great War. The Los Angeles Times editorialized, “It is quite impossible to tell wha t the war made the world safe for.” 339 America was still legally at war because the Senate hadn’t ratified the peace treaty. Some kind of conclusion was necessary in order to l ift the wartime restrictions that prevented American companies from trading with Germ any — once a major source of business. Both houses of Congress passed a simple resolution declaring the war over. Woodrow Wilson, still nursing a grudge over his defeat, vet oed it. The Senate couldn’t override the veto, and America remained officially at war. 340  3 3 6 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e s 4 3 0 - 4 3 1 . 3 3 7 T h e I l l u s i o n o f V i c t o r y b y T h o m a s F l e m i n g , p a g e 4 4 2 . 3 3 8 W o o d r o w W i l s o n a n d t h e G r e a t B e t r a y a l b y T h o m a s A .

W arren Harding was elected President with 61.6% of the vote. The Socialist Eugene V. Deb s received 3.5% of the presidential vote, even though he was still in prison for critic izing the war. The Republicans also won huge majorities in both houses of Congress. 342 Wilson, still living in a fantasy world, said the v oters “have disgraced us in the eyes of the world.” 343 THE HARDING ADMINISTRATION President Warren Harding was inaugurated on March 4 , 1921, and with the Republican Congress he sought a “return to normalcy.” In his presidential campaign, Harding had said: America’s present need is not heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; not agit ation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity. . . .

We should know what kind of person formulated the r ules by which Americans today are living and dying. Mental Depression During most of his adult life and his Presidency, W ilson suffered severe mental problems. Those problems didn’t begin with the stro kes he suffered while campaigning for the Peace Treaty in 1919. In 1896 he suffered what was probably a minor strok e, causing him to lose the use of his right hand for a while. In 1906 he had another stroke, and hypertension burst a blood vessel in his left eye — leaving his vision permane ntly impaired. In 1908 he again lost the use of his right hand temporarily. 349 When his first wife died in 1914, during his first presidential term, Wilson slipped into depression. He had trouble focusing on anything, an d his memory became weaker. He told an aide he could no longer think straight. The prob lem became worse each year. 350 He long had suffered from high blood pressure — a d isease for which there was no effective treatment in those days. Historian Dr. Be rt Park said: In 1917 he began to experience fairly severe headac hes, implying that his blood pressure was very much out of control. . . . On April 3rd [1919] he is felled by a severe viral illness manifested by temp eratures up to 103, diarrhea, and a very severe productive cough. At that point h e became delusional, particularly at night, and many individuals associa ted with him at the time became aware that he was having disorders of percep tion. . . . He’s really not thinking appropriately, he’s having a delusional st ate, and medically he did have what you would define as delirium.” 351  3 4 9 W o o d r o w W i l s o n b y H . W .

Describing him at the Paris negotiations, his aide Ike Hoover said: He was suddenly a different man, unreasonable, unna tural, simply impossible. His suspicions were intensified, his perspective di storted. His feelings about Colonel House now became an obsession. And he becam e obsessed with the idea that every French employee about the place was a spy for the French government. The President was sicker than the world ever knew. 352 Edith Wilson Wilson’s relationship with his second wife suggests a man who was reckless. Only six months after his first wife died, he met E dith Galt and immediately fell for her. He began courting her, and he asked her to mar ry him after only five weeks — less than a year after his first wife’s death. They were married in December 1915. 353 Even before he married Edith, Wilson was sharing go vernment secrets with her.

He won election in 1912 only because Theodore Roose velt ran as a 3rd-party candidate and split the Republican vote. He won a majority of votes in only one state outside the South. 356 He did effect two revolutionary changes in his firs t two years as President — creation of the Federal Reserve System and imposition of the first permanent income tax. Beyond that, Wilson’s only important political victory was manipulating America into war. He barely won reelection in 1916, even on the fraud ulent “he kept us out of war” platform. In 1918 and 1920, he tried to make the el ections referenda on his leadership and he was rudely rejected. 357 After betraying most of his principles in Paris, he blundered in trying to sell the pitiful result to the Senate — alienating those who should have been his supporters. It wasn’t idealism or principles that defeated him; it was his delusions, vindictiveness, and megalomania. By the time he left office in early 1921, he had ea rned widespread disgust. In the 1920s, Americans wanted desperately to forget their disastrous mistake in following Woodrow Wilson into a war that wasn’t theirs.  3 5 5 “ W o o d r o w W i l s o n , ” T h e A m e r i c a n E x p e r i e n c e , E p i s o d e T w o , P B S d o c u m e n t a r y ; t h e t r a n s c r i p t i s a t h t t p : / / w w w . p b s . o r g / w g b h / a m e x / w i l s o n / f i l m m o r e / f m _ t r a n s 1 . h t m l . 3 5 6 “ D i x i e c r a t s T r i u m p h a n t ” b y C h a r l e s P a u l F r e u n d , R e a s o n , M a r c h 2 0 0 3 , p a g e 1 6 . 3 5 7 H i s t o r i c a l S t a t i s t i c s o f t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s , C o l o n i a l T i m e s t o 1 9 7 0 , t a b l e s Y 7 9 - 8 3 a n d Y 2 0 4 - 2 1 0 , p a g e s 1 0 7 3 , 1 0 8 3 ."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 118 Megalomania Historian Louis Auchincloss said: He believed that he was directed by God and he freq uently said so.

Wilson knew what God wanted, knew what was right fo r the American people, knew what was right for the world. And he was determined to use the force of government to impose what was right on anyone who disagreed. He justified tyranny with empty rhetoric. For examp le, during his first presidential campaign in 1912, he said: I believe that God planted in us the visions of lib erty, . . . that we are chosen and prominently chosen to show the way to the natio ns of the world how they shall walk in the paths of liberty. 359 But during the war Americans lost the liberty to sp eak or write anything opposing the government. Dissenters were sentenced to 10 or 20 y ears in prison. He helped no one in the world “walk in the paths of liberty,” and he shoved many Americans off that path. Knowing what God wanted, he didn’t need anyone’s ad vice. His administration was, as Robert W. Tucker put it, “an inner circle of one.” 360 Essentially a petty man, he never forgot a slight. Official decisions often were paybacks for personal grudges.

H e had this extraordinary confidence that his was the right, that he was the special vehicle of the Lord, that he spoke the truth, so that opposition became almost in that definition sacrilegious. 361 His Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, said about him: Even in the case of a purely political question he appeared to consider opposition to be a personal affront and he was disp osed to retaliate in a personal way. . . . I think that it is not unjust t o say that President Wilson was stronger in his hatreds than in his friendships. 362 After Wilson’s death, H.L. Mencken called him the “ late Messiah” who had perfected the art of “reducing all the difficulties of the ho ur to a few sonorous and unintelligible phrases, often with theological overtones.” And the poet Robinson Jeffers referred to Wilson’s “huge delusion” that “the God of the stars needed his help. 363 Wilson a Man of Peace? Wilson’s fight for the League of Nations brought hi m a reputation as one who always sought peaceful solutions. Myth: Wilson was opposed to war, and tried desperately t o keep America out of war.

Wilson claimed to be acting on behalf of the locals . But the Haiti invasion, for example, killed 3,250 Haitians and left a hatred fo r the U.S. that lasted for decades. 364 In April 1914, when General Victoriano Huerta depos ed the Mexican government of Francisco Madero, Wilson ordered the U.S. navy to s eize the Mexican port of Vera Cruz. The battle killed 19 Americans and hundreds of Mexi cans, and provoked anti-American riots in South America. 365 Wilson’s actions toward Mexico were inconsistent an d chaotic. First he backed Venustiano Carranza, who became President. Then Wil son supported Pancho Villa. But Villa raided a New Mexico town in March 1916, and W ilson sent General John Pershing’s army into Mexico to capture Villa. That didn’t work out either, and Wilson — now distracted by the World War — recognized the Carran za regime and crossed Mexico off his “to do” list. 366 Ignorance Most people think of Woodrow Wilson as a brilliant man who knew much about the world and its history. That he was a college profes sor and President of Princeton University has helped further that impression. Myth: Wilson was extremely intelligent and knowledgeable . In truth, like many Presidents, Wilson knew little of history or geography, and cared even less about them.  3 6 4 P r o m i s e d L a n d , C r u s a d e r S t a t e b y W a l t e r A .

For example, the Italians showed him a phony map on which an Austrian mountai n was labeled “Vetta d’Italia” (“Italian peak”). This convinced him that the mount ain belonged to “historic Italy” — and should be returned to Italy from Austria. Wilson di dn’t even know that today’s nation of Italy didn’t exist until 1870. 367 As a result, 200,000 German-speaking people became part of Italy. 368 You might expect at least one member of the U.S. de legation to point this out to Wilson, but he had selected his associates for thei r conformity, not for their knowledge. As historian Ralph Raico put it: [L]ike virtually all American leaders who have dabb led in international politics, he knew practically nothing of the proble ms of other countries and peoples. What Wilson did possess was a little bundl e of abstract principles: democracy, self-determination of nations, and, abov e all, his cherished dream, the League of Nations. By applying these few princi ples, he fully intended to solve, once and for all, the colossally complex, ag e-old problems of Europe, if not the whole world. 369 In fact, Wilson was far from brilliant. He was just one more politician who had the power to force his way on people, and who believed he knew what was best for the entire world. Denying Failure Wilson usually found villains to blame for his fail ures — “willful men” or “pro- Germans” or “anti-Americans” or “imperialists” or s omeone else. Anyone but himself. When his party was repudiated in the 1920 elections , he didn’t wonder what mistakes he might have made.

O n the way to Europe for the peace negotiations, Wilson said: I am convinced that if this peace is not made on th e highest principles of justice, it will be swept away by the peoples of th e world in less than a generation. If it is any other sort of peace then I shall want to run away and hide . . . for there will follow not mere conflict but cataclysm. 371 Some people cite these words as a keen insight, and assume this sort of understanding animated everything Wilson did. But this was one mo re case where the reality of Wilson was contrary to the words of Wilson. He spoke in a high-minded way of a just peace, while cooperating in the “peace” that made the “cataclysm ” of World War II inevitable. And when he returned from Paris with a treaty that mocked the “highest principles of justice,” Wilson didn’t “run away and hide.” He sim ply deluded himself once more, and tried to convince others that he’d won a great vict ory. The logic of this denial forced him to insist that the treaty was so perfect it must be ac cepted intact — without a single reservation, a single qualifier, or the change of a single word. Only occasionally would he admit an unwelcome truth . But even then he would spray- paint it with words, rather than accept it for what it was. Once, when someone accused him of reneging on his promises for self-determination, Wilson replied: You have touched on the great metaphysical tragedy of today. My words have raised hopes in the hearts of millions of people. . . . There were a lot of things I hoped for but did not get. 372 For all those things he hoped for but did not get, he had sent 116,516 Americans to their deaths. 373 I doubt that any of their families thought the tra gedy was metaphysical.

In fact, Wilson was what many would call a “good Ch ristian man.” He felt he was God’s instrument to bring permanent peace to the wo rld, and he thought he knew how to do it. And that was the problem. To him, the death and des truction were justified because he was doing God’s work — the very definition of a fan atic. He claimed a license to say anything needed to carry out his mission, without r egard for facts and with no idea how he would keep his promises. Millions of people believe they’re doing God’s work . Fortunately, they don’t have the power to force their will on others. But Wilson did . Even in the hands of the most benevolent and intell igent person, the coercive power of government is a great danger. And even when that po wer is given to someone you think is a good man, it will flow eventually to the bad man wh o someday will replace him. America’s Founding Fathers recognized the danger in such power. They devised the Constitution to limit and divide the power of gover nment so that it couldn’t destroy us. As an old aphorism expresses it: Government is not reason; it is not eloquence; it i s force! Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. 374 Mankind’s enduring political problem is the belief that people can use that fire for good. But those who play with this fire almost alwa ys wind up the servants of a fearful master. Friedrich Hölderlin put it succinctly: What has made the State a hell on earth has been th at man has tried to make it his heaven. 375  3 7 4 T h i s s t a t e m e n t h a s f r e q u e n t l y b e e n a t t r i b u t e d t o G e o r g e W a s h i n g t o n , b u t I ’ v e n e v e r c o m e a c r o s s a s o u r c e f o r i t .

One Man’s Work It seldom happens that one person alone can alter f undamentally the direction of the world. But 1917 provided one of those rare exceptions. America’s entry into the war, which gave the world such a devastating turn, was the doing of one man: Woodrow Wilson. Had he protected American neutrality by refusing to side with the British, had he shunned the war as mo st Americans wanted when they reelected him in 1916, had he denied the Allies the ir vindictive treaty — had he done even one of these things, the catastrophes of the 20th c entury most likely would have been avoided. Eventually, Wilson had to acknowledge that he had f ailed to bring peace and order. As historian Jay Winter put it: He was a man who believed in this extraordinarily d ifficult goal and when he knew that he wouldn’t get there, the moment must ha ve been devastating for him.

Perhaps the supreme irony is that this man — who se nt so many Americans to their deaths — who helped the British, French, Italians, Russians, Belgians, and Japanese capture whole populations — whose delusions made Wo rld War II inevitable — this man in 1919 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 378 After all, it’s good intentions that count, not the wars you wage or the people you kill. Why ‘Greatness’? Why then is Woodrow Wilson considered one of the “g reat” Presidents? Why do some still refer to his Fourteen Points as a great moment of statesmanship — even though his plan never came close to fulfillmen t?

It was obvious to them that the Allies had bamboozled him at the Paris peace conference. John Maynard Keynes, the godfather of liberal econo mists, said, “There can seldom have been a statesman of the first rank more incomp etent than the President in the council chamber.” He also said that Wilson had “all the int ellectual apparatus of self- deception.” 380  3 7 8 N e w Y o r k T i m e s A l m a n a c , 2 0 0 2 , p a g e 8 5 3 . 3 7 9 “ W o r l d W a r I : T h e T u r n i n g P o i n t ” b y R a l p h R a i c o , i n T h e C o s t s o f W a r , e d i t e d b y J o h n V .

Millions of men spent several y ears in those trenches.

Two or thre e men go mad every day. 385 Often, thousands of corpses would remain on the gro und for days, causing an unbearable stench. 386 German novelist Erich Marie Remarque, who fought in the war, described what he saw: We see men living with their skulls blown open; we see soldiers run with their two feet cut off, they stagger on their splintered stumps into the next shell- hole; a lance corporal crawls a mile and a half on his hands dragging his smashed knee after him; another goes to the dressin g station and over his clasped hands bulge his intestines; we see men with out mouths, without jaws, without faces; we find one man who has held the art ery of his arm in his teeth for two hours in order to not bleed to death. 387 Prime Minister David Lloyd George said, “If people really knew, the war would be stopped tomorrow. But of course they don’t know and they can’t know.” 388  3 8 4 A M o d e r n H i s t o r y o f E u r o p e b y E u g e n W e b e r , p a g e 7 2 4 ; c i t e d i n T h e G r o w t h o f A m e r i c a , 1 9 7 8 - 1 9 2 8 b y C l a r e n c e B .

England spent on the war an amount greater than all the capital that had been invested in British industry. 389 The Dead and Wounded There was an enormous disregard for human life by t he military commanders. Army officers on both sides commanded their soldier s to leap out of the trenches and charge the enemy’s trenches, hoping to gain a few f eet of territory. The officers knew that the charging soldiers most likely would be mowed do wn by machine-gun fire — and in most cases they were. As historian Clarence B. Carson described it: [M]assed troops assaulting in broad daylight on ope n plains was suicidal. . . . Machine gunners, dug in, could repu lse any number of troops, afoot or on horseback, on the attack. 390 When U.S. General Charles Summerall was asked how t o deal with enemy machine guns, he answered “Charge ’em!” 391 The numbers of dead and wounded from single battles were simply stupendous. Historian Norman Stone estimated that a single day’s casualties in World War I were equal to all the casualties in all the European wars of the previous 100 years. 392 In July 1917, for example, British Field Marshal Do uglas Haig sent over 500,000 men into battle against the Germans at Ypres in Belgium .

Over 500,000 British soldiers were never found, and similar numbers of Russian, German, Austrian, and French soldiers disappeared. 400 Thus no exact total of the dead and wounded is poss ible. Various estimates have been made, but all we know for sure is that millions of people died. The Encyclopedia Britannica put the death toll at 8.5 million soldiers and 13 million civilians, a total of 21.5 million people. The civi lians died from starvation, exposure, disease, military encounters, and massacres. 401 In addition, at least 15 million soldiers and civilians were wounded. Millions more died in the 1918-1919 influenza epide mic, which was spread by the mass troop movements and malnourished civilians. 402 It is estimated that 16% of the male populations of Germany and France were killed. 403 The U.S. government estimated that 53,402 Americans were killed in combat. Another 63,114 soldiers died from accidents, disease, or su icide — many of them in training camps in the U.S. All told, it was estimated that 116,516 Americans died because of the war. 404 A total of 4,039,000 U.S. Army soldiers required me dical care of one kind or another — 97.8% of the army force. 405  3 9 9 A P e o p l e ’ s H i s t o r y o f t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s b y H o w a r d Z i n n , p a g e 3 6 1 . 4 0 0 W a r I s t h e F o r c e t h a t G i v e s U s M e a n i n g b y C h r i s H e d g e s , p a g e 3 1 . 4 0 1 B r i t a n n i c a 2 0 0 1 D e l u x e E d i t i o n C D - R O M , “ K i l l e d , W o u n d e d , a n d M i s s i n g ” f r o m W o r l d W a r I . 4 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 2 “ T h e H i s t o r i a n s ’ W a r ” b y D a v i d F r u m , T h e W e e k l y S t a n d a r d , J u n e 2 1 , 1 9 9 9 , p a g e 3 2 . 4 0 3 T h e G r o w t h o f A m e r i c a , 1 9 7 8 - 1 9 2 8 b y C l a r e n c e B .

They don’t conve y the agony of slow death, the maiming of healthy bodies, the tragedy of families without a father, the terrible waste of lives that were as precious to other people as your family is to you. As Joseph Stalin is reputed to have said, “A single death is a tragedy, a million dead is a statistic.” 406 In his War-Declaration speech Woodrow Wilson said: America is privileged to spend her blood and her mi ght for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which sh e has treasured. 407 Wilson may have thought that “America” was “privile ged to spend her blood,” but it wasn’t his blood that was spent. And I can’t help wondering ho w many of the people who were drafted and died, were wounded, or even crippl ed for life, or the families who lost a father or son felt so privileged. And if America’s peace had been so treasured, why did it go to war when it didn’t have to? But politicians see war as a great enterprise, and the deaths are merely “collateral damage” — acceptable losses. Whenever the public cr ied for their leaders to negotiate an end to the war, the politicians said that doing so would “break faith with those who have fallen” — as though killing more people would someh ow justify the loss of those already dead.

She described one batch of wounded brought into the hospital: They cannot breathe lying down or sitting up. They just struggle for breath. But nothing can be done. Their lungs are gone. Some with their eyes and faces entirely eaten away by the gas and bodies covered w ith burns. . . . One boy, today, screaming to die. The entire top layer of hi s skin burned from his face and body. I gave him an injection of morphine. . . . What’s the sense of it? Why did they have to be kil led before they had even begun to live? 408 As Flora Payne Whitney, the fiancée of Theodore Roo sevelt’s son, said to her betrothed before he went off to his death in Europe: Oh Quentin, why does it all have to be? It isn’t po ssible that it can be for any ultimate good that all the best people in the world have to be killed. 409 Collateral Damage To Shirley Millard and Flora Payne Whitney, the men who died or were wounded were all too real. To the politicians and other war advocates, the sol diers were just pawns on a chess board — to be moved around, to be treated like inan imate objects, to be sacrificed for the greater good.

It may take two or three years. It may even take five years. It may cost a million Americans, it may cost five million. However long it may take, however many men it costs, we must go through with it. 410 Historian Howard Zinn saw it differently. He summed up the war — a war based on lies: Ten million were to die on the battlefield; 20 mill ion were to die of hunger and disease related to the war. And no one since that d ay has been able to show that the war brought any gain for humanity that wou ld be worth one human life. 411 It’s worth noting that Secretary of State Lansing d idn’t volunteer to be one of the “million Americans” the war might cost. And while h e was telling himself the deaths were coming and were worth it, administration flunkies w ere leading the American people to believe that American soldiers wouldn’t even be inv olved in combat. When it was all over, the politicians — who hadn’t spent a day in a mud-soaked trench, smelled the stench of death, or urinated in their p ants from fear — paid tribute to those who “gave the last full measure of devotion” and then s at down to a hearty dinner. PRELUDE TO WORLD WAR II World War I made World War II inevitable. Germany has always been a strong nation with intell igent, literate, determined people. It could have been invited after the First World Wa r to join the community of nations — as it was after the Second World War. Instead, Germany was humbled, humiliated, devastate d, robbed, and told it that it was the source of all evil in the world. The Allied leaders, acting on the premise that only brute force can keep the peace, imposed terms on Germany that planted a desire for revenge.  4 1 0 “ A n I n n e r C i r c l e o f O n e : W o o d r o w W i l s o n a n d H i s A d v i s e r s ” b y R o b e r t T u c k e r , T h e N a t i o n a l I n t e r e s t , S p r i n g 1 9 9 8 , p a g e 1 5 . 4 1 1 A P e o p l e ’ s H i s t o r y o f t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s b y H o w a r d Z i n n , p a g e 3 5 9 ."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 139 There will always be thugs in the world.

Only then can the thug get the su pport, the financing, the devotion that enables him to menace the rest of the world. Too many people believe that overwhelming force can solve problems. But the greater the force exerted, the more brutal the terms impose d upon the losers, the more people on the losing side will turn to the thug to provide a remedy. Germany — the nation that produced Goethe, Schiller , Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Brahms — turned to Adolf Hitler when the German peo ple believed it to be the only way to reunite German families, to escape oppressive repar ations payments, and to recover German resources that been stolen at the end of Wor ld War I. Thus the fanatics at the Paris Peace Conference ass ured that the war would be fought all over again. Consequences of the War-Guilt Lie The myth of German war guilt has lingered for nearl y a century. It has been embellished with various adornments — such as the K aiser’s dreams of taking over the world. The myth nourished the belief that war is started b y a single aggressor who has to be stopped ahead of time. That idea has served many Pr esidents since Wilson — right up to the present day and the war in Iraq. But fastening the guilt on Germany certainly enhanc ed the desire for revenge that helped support the Nazi movement in the 1930s. As E rik von Kuehnelt-Ledhin wrote: There is no better way to generate hatred than by f orcing a person to sign a confession of guilt which he is sacredly convinced is untrue. This wanton humiliation, unprecedented up to that time in the a nnals of Christendom, created the thirst for revenge that the National So cialists [Nazis] so cleverly exploited. 412  4 1 2 L e f t i s m R e v i s i t e d : F r o m d e S a d e a n d M a r x t o H i t l e r a n d P o l P o t b y E r i k v o n K u e h n e l t - L e d h i n , p a g e 2 1 8 ."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 140 Consequences of the War The Russian Tsar, the German Kaiser, and Emperor Fr anz Joseph of Austria were all authoritarian rulers.

But ten short years later, most Russians would have gladly exchanged the chaotic, unpredictable tyranny of the Communists for the “go od old days” of stability under the Tsar. With the Tsar in charge, you had little to fe ar if you didn’t oppose the government. With the Communists, anyone might be hauled off to a concentration camp or sho t at any time.

The war didn’t just change Austria and Germany. Ame rica and the Allies were transformed as well. The historian A.J.P. Taylor wr ote: Until August 1914 a sensible, law-abiding Englishma n could pass through life and hardly notice the existence of the state, beyon d the post office and the policeman. He could live where he liked and as he l iked. He had no official number or identity card. He could travel abroad or leave his country forever without a passport or any sort of official permissi on. He could exchange his money for any other currency without restriction or limit. He could buy goods from any country in the world on the same terms as he bought goods at home. . . . An Englishman could enlist, if he chose, in the reg ular army, the navy, or the territorials. He could also ignore, if he chose , the demands of national defense. Substantial householders were occasionally called on for jury service. Otherwise, only those helped the state who wished t o do so. The Englishman paid taxes on a modest scale. . . . 413 England never went back to that prewar system. Nor did any other country — including the United States.  4 1 3 E n g l i s h H i s t o r y , 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 4 5 b y A . J . P .

Another face of these develo pments has been government-engendered terrorism, both on their own peoples and those in other lands. 414 World War I changed the nature of Europe and Americ a forever. Yes, it removed some bad rulers. But it replaced them with rulers who were far worse . And those new rulers instilled more than just fear. They ushered in a world in which governments claimed responsibility for every aspect of an individual’s life. Prior to 1917, “socialism” had been a dirty word in polite society . Today it is the rule — in deed if not in name — in virtually every developed country. And a large part of the “credit” for that goes to H itler, Lenin, and Stalin, none of whom would have come to power without World War I — and especially without American entry into the war. Their brutal, totalitarian regimes al lowed statists in other countries to promote the “middle way” — government social insurance, bus y-body government regulation of business, government ownership of important industr ies — as the preferred alternative to the extremes of the totalitarians. As a result, the idea of a truly free country, such as England or America was before 1914, has never again been considered. The Greatest Catastrophe World War I was undoubtedly the greatest catastroph e of the modern era — and possibly of all history. It demolished the old order and enabled the Communi sts to take over in Russia. It devastated Germany, making it possible for a thug l ike Adolf Hitler to exploit the German people’s desire for revenge.

No longer was it just Europe wi th its eternal quarrels; now the whole world was on a permanent war footing. Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn summed up the result: An inventory of the state of Central Europe in 1934 , half a generation after the treaties of Versailles, St. Germain-en-Laye, Neuill y, and Trianon, finds that Germany was ruled by a totalitarian dictatorship of the Nazis; that the Czechs of “Czechoslovakia” uneasily held sway over the non -Czechs who waited for a day of revenge; that Poland under Pilsudksi and Aus tria under Dollfuss were authoritarian states; that Hungary, ruled by an oli garchy, had very limited democracy; that Rumania’s Iron Guard was preparing to conquer the country; that Yugoslavia, after the murder of Radi ж , had been taken over by Belgrade’s terror regime which governed through assassination and execution; and that neither Bulgaria nor Albania had parliamentary gove rnments. In other parts of the world, Lithuania and Estonia had become dictatorships. Latvia and Greece had two more years before falling to a similar fate. Spain was girding up for its bloody civil war , and Portugal had no parliamentary government. In Russia the Duma had lo ng since disappeared. In Japan parliamentary life had by 1935 become as farc ical as in Turkey, and on and on. In other words, the Holy Crusade to make the world safe for democracy, with its millions killed and billions spent, in the end saw the total defeat of democracy and, far worse, the destruction of the li beral principle of personal freedom. 415 The war would have been a disaster no matter what, but not such a catastrophe if the United States had just stayed out of it. Had Americ a remained on the sidelines, had Wilson followed the policy of strict neutrality he claimed to be practicing: • There would have been an armistice during 1917, mos t likely leaving Europe pretty much as it was before 1914. • The Allies would have lacked the power to impose pu nitive reparations upon Germany.  4 1 5 L e f t i s m R e v i s i t e d b y E r i k v o n K u e h n e l t - L e d d i h n , p a g e s 2 2 1 - 2 2 2 ."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part I 143 • Mass starvation in Germany would have ended by 1917 , instead of 1919. • Germany wouldn’t have handed the Bolsheviks the opp ortunity to seize power in Russia, kill millions of Russians, and swe ep up Eastern Europe. • There would have been no 15 years of resentment and thirsting for revenge that prompted too many Germans to accept the man wh o promised to get even — Adolf Hitler. Even Winston Churchill, a man who never seemed to s hy from war, saw this. In 1936 he stated: America should have minded her own business and sta yed out of the World War. If you hadn’t entered the war the Allies would have made peace with Germany in the Spring of 1917. Had we made peace th en there would have been no collapse in Russia followed by Communism, a nd Germany would not have signed the Versailles Treaty, which has enthro ned Nazism in Germany. If America had stayed out of the war, all these “is ms” wouldn’t today be sweeping the continent in Europe and breaking down parliamentary government, and if England had made peace early in 1917, it would have saved over one million British, French, American an d other lives. 416 Of course, just four years later, Churchill was enc ouraging Franklin D.

The worst things that have occurred since 1918 — su ch as World War II or the Cold War — wouldn’t have happened if America had simply stayed out of World War I. The lies that paved the way for the U.S. to interve ne not only broke faith with the American people, they facilitated a catastrophe tha t turned the 20th century into the bloodiest epoch in human history.  4 1 7 “ T i m e P r e f e r e n c e , G o v e r n m e n t , a n d t h e P r o c e s s o f D e - C i v i l i z a t i o n ” i n T h e C o s t s o f W a r , e d i t e d b y J o h n V .
