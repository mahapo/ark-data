He completed Part I: World War I, and it was released as an eBook in August, 2008. However, he passed on before he finished Part II: The Perpetual War. Although The War Racket , Part II is incomplete, a couple of chapters are complete and there are extensive notes for the remaining chapter s. Also included in the eBook are a number of appendices (i.e. The Myths of War, Sellin g War, The Recurring Lies, Power, and Miscellaneous Notes) that Harry had planned to integrate into Part II. In addition, I've included 72 war articles at the e nd of the eBook that Harry wrote between the years of 1999 to 2005 ~ although one da tes as early as 1976 and another in 1991. Please note that the articles are listed in c hronological order. A week ago I found a note in Harry's war book files . It states, \" Book Objective: I hope this book will encourage a restoration of the Ameri ca of peace and liberty that once existed, but has been overwhelmed by the relentless political push for \"national greatness.\" I, too, hope this eBook will encourage a restoratio n of America.

What is surprising is that every war runs on so man y of the same lies, myths, promises, and propaganda. As we examine the wars after 1918, you’ll find the very tales told to lure Americans into World War I recycled again and again — and always a s though they had never been told before.

The public rarely se es pictures of dead American soldiers — unless they’re pictures of enem y atrocities. • Death is trivialized. So long as enemy casualties a re larger, any number of American deaths is considered a price worth payi ng. • The reason for going to war keeps changing. If a pa rticular justification is refuted, or if a promise is shown to be unfulfil led, war advocates simply skip to another reason — from imminent dange r, to liberation, to a new world of peace, to spreading democracy, to wh atever sounds best at the moment.

INTRODUCTION Despite the propaganda, some wars have remained con troversial. The promises made for World War I were so thoroughly refuted by events th at the war doesn’t stand as a shining moment in American history. The Vietnam War has a v ery poor reputation. Even the Gulf War of 1991 has received a great deal of criti cism. But one war has stood the test of time. No matter h ow much cynicism prevails about American wars in general, World War II maintains it s reputation as the one “just war.” So it’s fitting that we take a closer look at the b ig one — WWII — because such a look reveals that it was sold to the American people as deceptively as any other war. THE GERMANS IN THE SUDETENLAND At the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles had created the new nation of Czechoslovakia out of a piece of the prewar Austria -Hungary empire and a section of Germany, the Sudetenland. The title of the country was a misnomer. There were more Germans than Slovaks in the country, and the Czechs oppressed both groups. It w asn’t surprising that the Sudeten Germans wanted to reunite with Germany. 1   1 L e ft i sm Re v is i te d b y E ri k vo n K u eh n el t -L e dd i hn , p a ge 22 0"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 14 NAZIS WANTED RETRIBUTION When Hitler came to power in 1933, it had been only 14 years since the Treaty of Versailles had been imposed upon Germany. And when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938 to retake the Sudetenland, i t had been only 19 years since the Allies had taken the territory from the Germans. Thus the humiliation caused by the treaty was in 19 38 as recent as an event of 1985 would be in 2004. Not only Nazi officers and soldie rs were eager for revenge, but virtually the entire German population was aware of the starvation, the assigning of all the war guilt to Germany, and the other devastation and indignities imposed on the German people so few years before. CZECHOSLOVAKIA, POLAND, & THE GERMANS Woodrow Wilson had said in 1919 that the League of Nations would rectify any injustices caused by the rearranging of boundaries in the Treaty of Versailles. But that wasn’t the case. The Sudetenland, the part of Germany given to Czech oslovakia at the end of World War I, contained 1.6 million Germans. They, as well as the Slovaks, were mistreated by the Czechs. Civil liberties were curtailed; peaceful di ssent was outlawed. No complaints by the German government were heeded at the League of Nations. 2 The situation was similar in Poland. 3 In 1931, the League accepted a report accusing th e Poles of oppressing the Germans inside Poland. But nothing was done to correct the situation. 4   2 C z ec h o- S lo v ak i a: A C ri ti c a l H is t or y b y K u rt Gl az e r , p ag e s 1 3- 3 3; ci t ed i n “ W or l d W a r I : T h e T ur n in g P o in t” by Ra l ph Ra i co , i n T he C o s t s o f W ar , p a ge 24 4. 3 O r ph a ns of Ve r sa i ll e s: T h e G e rm a ns in We s t P ol an d by Ri c ha r d B la n ke , p ag e s 2 1 , 2 9, a n d 2 3 6- 2 37 ; c i te d i n “ W o r ld Wa r I : T h e T u rn i ng P o in t” by Ra l ph Ra i co , i n T h e C o s ts of Wa r , p ag e s 2 44 -2 4 5 . 4 T h e M ak i ng of Ad o lf Hi tl e r b y E u ge n e D av i ds o n, p a g e 2 89 ; c i te d i n “ Wo rl d Wa r I : T h e T u rn i ng Po i nt ” b y Ra l p h R ai c o, in Th e C o st s o f W a r , pa g e 2 46 ."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 15 The basic attitude in the League concerning the mis treatment of German minorities was that this was an internal matter and the League dea lt only with disputes between nations. 5 POLAND & BRITISH MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATY Winston Churchill said of the defense treaty signed by Neville Chamberlain with the Poles in March 1939: “Here was decision at last, ta ken at the worst possible moment and on the least satisfactory ground which must surely lead to the slaughter of tens of millions of people.” He went on to say in reference to Poland “which wit h hyena appetite had only six months before joined in the pillage and destruction of the Czechoslovak State.” 6 Historian Ralph Raico says that Churchill actually supported the treaty at the time it was signed. 7 Relationship with Stalin When Germany invaded Poland, the British government immediately declared war on Germany, in accordance with its mutual-defense trea ty with Poland. But when the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the o ther side, the British didn’t say a word. Through a large part of the war, Poland was occupie d in the west by the Germans and in the east by the Soviets. During that time, the Brit ish cooperated with Polish flyers and Polish refugees in fighting the Germans. But at the same time, the British treated the Soviets as allies — even though the Soviets were oc cupying half of the homeland of the Brits’ Polish allies.   5 O r ph a ns of Ve r sa i ll e s: T h e G e rm a ns in We s t P ol an d by Ri c ha r d B la n ke , p ag e s 1 3 2, 1 3 6 -1 3 7; ci t ed in “ W or ld W ar I: Th e T u rn i ng Po in t ” b y R al p h R ai c o, in T h e C o st s o f W a r , p ag e s 2 46 . 6 T h e G a th e ri n g S to r m , pag e 34 7 ; c it e d i n “ R e th in k i ng Ch u rc h il l” by Ra lp h Ra i co , i n T h e C o st s o f W a r, ed i te d b y J o hn V.

While America was still officially neutral, Roosevelt was sending money and war materials to the Soviets. That was accelerated once America was officially in the war. By 1941 the Soviet Union had compiled a long histor y of oppression. For example, millions of peasants died in the 1920s as the Sovie ts attempted to stamp out all forms of private agriculture. This was no secret. But the U. S. was lining up shoulder-to-shoulder with the oppressors, in order to fight the Nazis. During the war, the American people might have unde rstood if Roosevelt had said to them something like this: “These are difficult times. The world is threatened by many forces. At this time, it’s important that we make common cause with one of those forces — the Soviet Union — in order to defeat what we think is a greater immediate threat, Nazi Germany.” But he didn’t. He didn’t ignore the hypocrisy of jo ining forces with one tyrant, to defeat what was supposedly a greater tyrant. Instead the government unleashed a propaganda campa ign to convince the American people that the Russian people were our allies, and that Josef Stalin was a great leader. Hollywood was enlisted to produce movies suggesting that the Russians were the only thing standing between the Nazis and world dominati on. Of course, once the war was over, everything change d. Now, suddenly, the Soviets were evil monsters about to devour the war — unless the U.S. maintained a huge military, intervened in local disputes all over the world, an d took sides with other evil monsters. This wouldn’t be the last time the U.S. government would take sides with a tyrant, only to point to that same tyrant later as a reason to g o to war. Saddam Hussein in Iraq was our savior against Iran; Manuel Noriega in Panama, Diem in Vietnam, and Suharto in Indonesia were our saviors against the communists. And there were others. In all cases, eventually our politicians pointed to these men as evil monsters that our government had to destroy in order to keep the world safe.

Roosevelt Speech, Chautauqua, New York, August 14, 1936 Quoted by Charles Callan Tansill “The United States and the Road to War in Europe” Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, page 79. REASONS FOR AMERICANS’ ISOLATIONIST ATTITUDE As we saw in Part I, Woodrow Wilson and other admin istration officials lied shamelessly before the U.S. entered World War I, claiming neutr ality while doing everything to help Britain and draw America into the war. During the 1920s and 1930s, various official docume nts were released that revealed these deceptions. When Americans became aware that Americ a’s entry into the war had been caused by lies, they were adamant about not getting into World War II. The idea that Americans were Nazi sympathizers or anti-Semitic is absurd; they were simply anti-war and determined not to be sucked into Europe’s troub les once again. 8 ROOSEVELT’S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE JAPANESE He supported the 1924 legislation that excluded Asi ans. He said at the time:   8 “ W or l d W ar I: Th e T u rni n g P o in t” by Ra l ph Ra ic o , i n T h e C os t s o f W ar , p a ge 22 7 ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 18 Californians have properly objected [to Japanese im migration] on the sound basic ground . . . that the mingling of Asiatic blo od with European or American blood produces, in nine cases out of ten, the most unfortunate results. 9 THE MYTHS OF WHY WE WENT TO WAR The question of war responsibility in relation to 1 939 and 1941 is taken for granted as completely and forever settled. It is wi dely held that there can be no controversy this time. Since it is admitted by a ll reasonable persons that Hitler was a dangerous neurotic, who, with supreme folly, launched a war when he had everything to gain by peace, it is assu med that this takes care of the European aspects of the war-guilt controversy. With respect to the Far East, this is supposed to be settled with equal fin ality by asking the question: “Japan attacked us, didn’t she?” Harry Elmer Barnes Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, page 9. Roosevelt Running the War The final authority for all military decisions by a ll the allies was FDR. He had no training in military strategy. See Roosevelt & Stalin for a list of all the disastrous things he did: unconditional surrender, aborting the Mediterranean landing, giving Eastern Europe to Stalin. How many people died as a result of the decisions o f this sick, pompous, arrogant individual? How many people died as a result of Stalin having c ontrol of Eastern Europe? How many Americans went without some of the necessi ties of life in order to finance a Cold War that probably would have been avoided if R oosevelt had not been cozying up to Stalin?   9 W i n o v er Sa n d: Th e D i plo m a cy of Fr a nk l in Ro o se ve l t b y F r ed e ri c k W .

They could be contained by a modest defensive force of A merican ships and planes, letting us throw most of our military might into the European war.” Thomas Fleming http://hnn.us/articles/1691.html History News Network, September 22, 2003 “In Nearly All of Our Wars We’ve Made Serious Mista kes” PEARL HARBOR December 8, 1941: Roosevelt addresses Congress to s eek a declaration of war, saying . . . “Yesterday, December 7, 1941 — a date which will l ive in infamy — the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked b y naval and air forces of the empire of Japan. “The United States was at peace with that nation, a nd, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its E mperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. . . . “The Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued pe ace.” Options Available to Roosevelt Administration "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 20 Knowing that the Japanese were going to attack Pear l Harbor, there were several things the Roosevelt administration could have done. But t he value of those options depended on what Roosevelt wanted to achieve. 1. They could have announced to the world that they knew the Japanese fleet was headed for Pearl Harbor. This would have caused the fleet to turn around and go back to Japan. If they wanted to save lives at Pearl Harbor, this was a good idea. If they wanted to draw the Japanese into a war, it was a bad idea. 2. They could have informed the Pearl Harbor comman ders of the approaching Japanese fleet. The commanders would have sent out patrol planes that would have determined the exact location of the fleet. Th is also would have caused the fleet to turn around and go back to Japan. If they wanted to save lives at Pearl Harbor, this was a good idea. If they wanted to draw the Japanese into a war, it was a bad idea. 3. They could withhold the information of the appro aching Japanese fleet from the Pearl Harbor commanders and the public, and let the Japanese attack take place. If they wanted to save lives at Pearl Harbor, this was a bad idea. If they wanted to draw the Japanese into a war, it was a good idea. They chose the third option, because drawing the Ja panese into a war was more important to them than saving lives. In their eyes, the lives were expendable, but getting into the war with Japan firing the first shot was an opportu nity too good to be passed up.

Politicians Running the War Not only FDR making invasion and other decisions, b ut Truman dropping the A-bomb even though none of the top military people wanted it. Why the Japanese Attacked I was only 8 years old when the war started, and 12 when it ended. But I followed it very closely. I read the news in the daily paper and lis tened to reports on the radio. I studied the maps of the war zones. And, like many young boy s, I reveled vicariously in the Allied victories — imagining myself to be a part of them. I still remember a great deal of what was said duri ng those days.

Did they just plain hate us for our freedoms, our d emocracy, and our prosperity (as in the current slogan about terroris ts)? Even those historians who still want to absolve Roo sevelt from any responsibility for Pearl Harbor don’t bother trying to answer that que stion — at least not any of the historians I’ve studied. The answer to the question is obvious to anyone who has studied the diplomatic history of 1940-1941: U.S. negotiators made it very clear t o the Japanese that if their military forces didn’t retreat to the Japanese islands, ther e would be war between Japan and the United States — and, seeing the inevitability of wa r with America, the Japanese wanted to strike first and cripple the American fleet. Negotiations Lie “The Japanese deceived America by negotiating at th e very time they were planning the Pearl Harbor attack.” Truth: The Japanese were negotiating in hope that t he Pearl Harbor attack would be unnecessary. It was the Americans who were negotiating falsely, as Roosevelt had no intention of coming to any kind of agreement whatsoever with the Japanese. In fact, the negotiations were intended to serve one purpose only: to goad th e Japanese into attacking. ROOSEVELT’S GREATNESS Communist spies in the administration.

SLANDER OF ANTI-WAR ACTIVISTS Myth One recurring myth that refuses to die is that most of the leading anti-war activists were either anti-Semitic or pro-Nazi. This myth has help ed to encourage the idea that the American people by and large were eager before Pear l Harbor to help our Allies, and thus no deception by Franklin Roosevelt was necessary to get America into war. This simply isn’t true. A majority of Americans fel t that American entry into World War I had been a mistake and were eager to see that it didn’t happen again. The America First Committee led the struggle to make sure that the po liticians didn’t suck America into war again. Anti-Semitism It’s easy to ascribe anti-Semitic motives to war op ponents decades after the war. For heaven sake, everyone knows that Hitler killed six million Jews! Only an anti-Semite could view that without being outraged. But what’s wrong with that picture? The error is in thinking that anyone in America kne w about the Holocaust in 1940-1941. In fact, there was no Holocaust then. It didn’t beg in until the last half of 1941, 10 there was no general inkling of the exterminations until 1944 , and the Holocaust wasn’t fully accepted by even American intelligence until Americ an soldiers came upon the concentration camp at Buchenwald on April 11, 1945.   1 0 “ Ho l oc a us t : V II I , B eg in n i ng s o f t h e E xt e rm i na ti o n ,” M i cr o so f t E nc a rt a R e fe r en c e L i b ra r y 2 00 3 ."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 26 Yes, Hitler was anti-Semitic. And so were millions of people in Europe at that time — as had been the case for hundreds of years — and conti nues to be the case today in many areas. Jews in Germany were treated badly in the 1930s — a s were peasants in Russia, businessmen in the United States, peons in banana r epublics, and slaves in many parts of the world. But no one knew that Hitler planned to exterminate every Jew he could get his hands on. Contrary to other myths about Hitler, he didn’t say in Mein Kampf that he planned to wipe out the Jewish race.

But if it does, it should also damn Franklin Roosevelt. Let me explain. Enduring Myth One enduring myth of World War II is the confusion of fascism with anti-Semitism. They are not the same thing, and in fact there is nothin g in either philosophy that automatically calls forth the other. Anti-Semitism is a racial philosophy. Fascism is an economic philosophy. Nazism (National Socialism) is a political philosophy. Communism is an economic system in which all privat e property is abolished and everything is owned by “the people in common” (mean ing by whoever gets to be the ruler). "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 27 Socialism is an economic system in which the govern ment owns the principal means of production — the steel industry, the auto industry, the Post Office, electric power, health care, and such. But individuals are still able to o wn their own cars, their own homes — their own personal property, in other words. Fascism is an economic system in which most means o f production remains in private ownership. However, the state makes all the major e conomic decisions — how much can be produced, what prices should be, who should get access to the best resources, and so on. Hitler was not an economist; he was a politician. H e didn’t invent fascism or even promote it as the salvation of the world. He simply adopted it. Benito Mussolini was a fascist, as well as a politician. Mussolini prom oted fascism before taking over Italy in 1921, and he immediatel y began reorganizing the Italian economy on a fascist basis. When Hitler acquired the leadership of Germany in 1 933 through parliamentary means, he immediately set about to acquire absolute power. Germany was economically devastated; not only was it in the midst of the sam e Great Depression as the rest of the world, it had already been ravaged by World War I r eparations as well as socialism and hyper-inflation the 1920s. Hitler saw fascism as a means to acquire the power he wanted, and most of the German people were so economically depressed they were wil ling to try anything. While fascism is no more able to create wealth out of nothing than is socialism or communism, the sense of national pride, everyone wo rking together (supposedly), and strong leadership affected the confidence of most G ermans. They were willing to work harder, their spirits lifted, and they helped rebui ld the German economy. Many Americans saw the restoration of Germany durin g the mid-1930s as evidence that fascism works — that it could be applied in other c ountries with equal success. As it happens, they were wrong. You might increase the “G ross Domestic Product” of a country by building military equipment or reduce th e unemployment rate by drafting young men, but you can’t raise the standard of livi ng of people that way. However, few people anywhere are economic experts. And so it was easy for some people to be attracted to the apparent gains being made in Germany. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 28 Charles Lindbergh was one of them. He was not for m istreating Jews, he was not for German conquest. But he saw the apparent rebirth of Germany and congratulated Hitler on it. Meanwhile, in the United States Franklin Roosevelt was doing a lot of the same things that Hitler was. He didn’t call it fascism, and he might not even have known what the word meant. But Mussolini should have been proud of him. The tw o cornerstones of Roosevelt’s New Deal were the National Recovery Act (NRA) and the A griculture Adjustment Act (AAA). Both were pure fascism. In each case, the means of production remained in p rivate hands, but the government made all the decisions. In the NRA, every company i n a particular industry was herded into a single cartel in which all principal decisio ns were made by a Roosevelt-appointed administrator. Even shopkeepers were forced into si milar cartels. “Free enterprise” was virtually non-existent. The AAA was similar. Government “experts” determine d how much corn could be planted, how much wheat, and so on. There were many more programs that mixed fascism an d socialism, but the NRA and the AAA were the leading edge of the New Deal. The NRA was declared unconstitutional by the Suprem e Court in 1935. The AAA died more from public disgust, but its central idea — th at government should determine how much of any commodity the country needs — lives on even today in the perennial farm programs decreed by Congress. The New Deal was a failure. In 1938, five years aft er Roosevelt’s inauguration, the unemployment rate was still 19%. But it set in plac e programs, powers, and responsibilities for the federal government that co ntinue today. It was a revolution in America. But it isn’t the subject of this book. What we need to understand is that the people who o pposed American entry into the European war were not pro-Nazi, pro-Hitler, or anti -American. They wanted Americans to be able to live in peace. Incidentally, the day after Pearl Harbor, Charles L indbergh tried to enlist in the Army Air Force, but was turned down because of his age. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 29 Myth of Liberating Europe “Americans fought and died to liberate France and t he other European countries.” This myth has always enjoyed some circulation, but it was trotted out in earnest in 2002 and 2003 for two purposes: 1. In order to condemn the French people as ungrateful when they refused to support George Bush’s plan to attack Iraq. 2. To support the notion that Americans have alway s fought to liberate oppressed people in other lands. However, the myth is simply a myth — not reality. Americans went to France to fight because they’d be en told that if Hitler wasn’t stopped in Europe, his next step would be to invade America . Better to stop him on foreign soil than to have to fight for our homeland on our homeland. I doubt that there was a single soldier fighting in Europe who believed he was fighting for the oppressed people of Europe. He was fighting bec ause he believed the future of America was at stake. The U.S. government and the entertainment industry cooperated in the making of numerous propaganda documentaries, exhortations, wa r-bond promotions, and other drum-beating productions. They stressed that all th e freedoms we held dear were at stake. As a boy, I followed the war closely in newspapers, in magazines, and at the movie theater. I never once heard or read anything implyi ng that we were fighting the war to free the people of Europe. Americans were told how heroic the Russians were an d how much the English needed the “bundles for Britain” (donated clothing and food), but to the best of my recollection no one ever said that Americans were fighting and dyin g for foreign people. There were all the promises about a postwar world i n which everyone everywhere would be free — enjoying Roosevelt’s “Four Freedoms” (and free cable TV presumably) — and wars would be a thing of the past.

In other words, it was an appeal to our own self-interest more than to humanitarian ins tincts. Of course, once the war was over, all the war theme s were embellished — and embellished — and embellished. All sorts of noble s entiments were introduced retroactively into the story of the war. And those retroactive motivations often were belied by current events. So if my boyhood recollections are unpersuasive to you, consider thi s: at the very time the myth of “fighting to liberate the oppressed European people” was begi nning to flower, our government stood by and watched the peoples of Poland, Czechos lovakia, Hungary, Albania, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria disappear between the Iron Curtain. Even though the Soviet Union was exhausted, devasta ted, and broke at the end of World War II, and the U.S. was powerful enough to impose its way on anyone, the U.S. government didn’t use its power to “liberate” 100 m illion captive people. And very few Americans raised any objection. PROPAGANDA Reich Marshall Hermann Goering at the Nuremberg tri al: \"The people can always be brought to the bidding of leaders. That is easy.

The military immediately shut down the phone lines linking reporters in Hawaii with the American mainland. An official U.S. military communiqué announced that one destroyer and one obsolete battleship had been sunk, with a few other ships da maged lightly, while the Japanese suffered huge losses. A few weeks later, the Secretary of the Navy correc ted the initial report, and said that one modern battleship had been sunk, while another had capsized but could be retrieved. He said the Pacific fleet was basically intact and was now sailing westward to encounter the enemy. The Secretary was applauded for being so ope n and honest about American losses. On the one-year anniversary of the attack, the gove rnment issued new information on the Pearl Harbor losses. Now it was revealed that five battleships had been sunk or damaged — giving the impression that they hadn’t all been s unk, only damaged and could be repaired. In 1966, the figure was increased to eight battlesh ips — again either sunk or damaged. In fact, it was known immediately in 1941 that five battleships — the Arizona , the Oklahoma , the California , the Nevada , and the West Virginia were all sunk and lost forever. But this information was never announced p ublicly — even though anyone in Honolulu at the time could have told you so. Was this information withheld so the enemy wouldn’ t know how vulnerable the American fleet was at the time? No. In fact, the Japanese pilots could see the batt leships sinking and knew what they had achieved. The next day Tokyo newspapers carried a f ull account of the American losses. Since the American embassy staff in Japan could see what the Japanese knew, the   11 “ S lo u ch i ng To w ar d C a tas t r op h e” b y G e or g e H .

It might have made Americans even more determined to gain revenge on the Japanes e — the way the World Trade Center disaster in 2001 caused Americans to write a blank check to the government to do anything it wanted, presumably to in some way exact revenge for what happened. But whether the government was right or wrong in as sessing the public’s mood in 1941 is irrelevant. The essential point is that the governm ent lied to its own people .

WAR CRIMES TRIALS Nuremburg Trials “Nuremburg trials established principles of war cri mes.” Russians scot-free. Bombing of Dresden. The victors get to write the history. At the end of the war, the American, British, Sovie t, and French governments jointly staged a series of “war crimes” trials — sometimes known as “the Nuremberg trials.” In these trials, leading Nazi officials were aggres sing on other countries, “crimes against humanity,” forced labor, and crimes against the Ger man people.

The trials were quite different from American court room trials. A couple of dozen defendants were on trial at one time, collectively charged with broad crimes committed by the Nazi leadership. The premise was that anyone who did not resist the Nazi leadership was guilty of whatever the Nazis did. In many cases, decisions were rendered on the basis of hearsay evidence — affidavits or other third-party accounts, with the defendants hav ing no ability to cross-examine those who supposedly made the statements being used as ev idence. Another drawback of the trials was that foreign pow ers were trying Nazi officials for crimes against the German people. Logic dictates th at trials for such crimes should be conducted by Germans. The great lie of the war crimes trials was that the y would deter future aggressors — that they would set an example that would prevent wars i n the future. As we’ve seen in the 58 years since then, they have done no such thing. But they did do one thing to make wars much worse t han they had been previously. Now that government leaders knew that t hey could be tried and hanged if they lost a war, they had a strong incent ive to resist surrendering even when a war was lost — causing additional deaths — a nd they had a strong incentive to commit additional barbarities in order to avoid winding up in the dock and facing victors’ justice.

HISTORIANS KNOW THE TRUTH Although most historians idolize Franklin Roosevelt , most of them acknowledge what he did and claim that he had to lie to the American pe ople for our own good. Harry Elmer Barnes wrote about one historian review ing an anti-Roosevelt book: . . . he expressed himself as in almost complete a greement with [Frederic R.] Sanborn’s account of the crucial Japanese-Ameri can negotiations in 1941 [Design for War]: “It is perfectly true — as D r. Sanborn proves — that in 1941 the Japanese seriously wanted peace and tha t Roosevelt and Hull used every possible device to forestall it, and to provoke an open attack by Japan.” He even admits that Roosevelt and Hull anti cipated this attack. He excuses all this on the ground that our entry into the war was obligatory for American security from Nazi invasion and for the sa lvation of humanity, and that the provocation of the Japanese was only “ penetrating foresight,” because Hitler and Mussolini were just mean enough not to rise to Roosevelt’s war bait in the Atlantic. Hence, we had to incite Japan to attack us in order to get into the war through the Pacific back door. 13 Wagner Just as Brahms and Beethoven were banned in World W ar I, the music of Richard Wagner was identified as a source of evil in World War II.   13 “ Re v is i on i sm an d t h e H i st o ri c al Bl a ck o ut ” by H ar r y E lm e r B ar n es in P e r pe t ua l W a r f o r P e rp e tu a l P ea c e, pa ge s 43 - 44 ."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 35 It was known that Wagner was Adolf Hitler’s favorit e composer, and that was enough to make Wagner persona non grata. It was many years after World War II before America n symphony orchestras could safely schedule Wagner pieces. And as late as 2001, a Wagn er piece had to be scrapped from the schedule of the Israel Music Festival because W agner’s “name and creations are closely associated with the Nazi regime.” 14 During and for years after World War II, the only t ime an American was likely to hear Wagner’s music was when it was used to accompany Na zi scenes in a World War II movie. It is true that Wagner was somewhat anti-Semitic, b ut he was far from a racist — and his views on any “master race” were light years apart f rom Hitler’s. As with many people, his anti-Jewish attitude was mostly an emotional re action to his own anecdotal experiences and didn’t reflect a theory of racial s uperiority or inferiority. Wagner was perhaps the most intellectual of classic al composers. Unlike other composers, he wrote the words to his operas, he wro te books on philosophy, and every bit of his music emanated from both musical inspiration and philosophical beliefs. He changed his mind about many things over the year s. But one constant attitude throughout his adult life was his opposition to the state. And the two most dominant themes in his writings and his operas were the poin tlessness of life and redemption through love. Neither of these could be considered, by any stretch of the imagination, to be a glorification of the state, of racial superior ity, of war, or of conquest. Some of Wagner’s music is triumphant — for example, the overtures to Meistersinger, Tannhäuser, and Rienzi. But music alone can’t expre ss an intellectual concept; it can portray only an emotion or a feeling. So, without w ords, an instrumental piece might express triumph, but it can’t tell you what has tri umphed. It might be the triumph of a police state or it might be the triumph of individu al liberty. Hitler may have spoken of Wagner’s “heroes,” but he neglected to mention that Wagner’s heroes almost all die prematurely in his operas. Hi tler may not have known what he was talking about, but people have used his tastes as j ustification to deny music-goers elsewhere the opportunity to hear some glorious mus ic.   14 h t tp : // w ww . ya d -v a sh e m. o r g. i l/ a bo u t_ y ad / pr e ss _r o o m/ i n_ t he _ ne w s/ w ag n er .h t m l"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 36 If I were to quit listening to music that I knew wa s enjoyed by someone I didn’t like, I would soon be deprived of all good music.

Thr ee days later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. It is estimated that 20,000 pe ople were killed there. Probably no instrument of war in the history of the world was as devastating as the dropping of those bombs. In addition to the immedia te death toll, hundreds of thousands of survivors suffered radiation poisoning and died slow, agonizing deaths. In John Hersey’s book Hiroshima , published in 1946, he relates the story of one of the survivors of the first bombing: Mr. Tanimoto found about twenty men and women on th e sandpit. He drove the boat onto the bank and urged them to get aboard . They did not move and he realized that they were too weak to lift themsel ves. He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge glove-like pieces. He was so sickened by this that he had to s it down for a second. . . . he had to keep consciously repeating to himself, “These are human beings.” 19 There’s another good description in one of the othe r reference books. People were burned as though they had been placed i n microwave ovens. Many of the people died instantly. But many of them died lingering deaths — suffering unimaginable burning and other effects of the radiation. Some of those died within an hour, some within a day, and some took days to die. It was as gruesome as though they ’d been tortured to death. Had their deaths taken place in torture chambers, w e rightly would have condemned their killers as war criminals. But because their gruesom e deaths occurred as the result of a bombing, we treat their killers — not just the airm en, but the politicians who ordered the killing — as heroes.   19 Q u ot e d i n T he De c is i on t o U se th e A t om i c B om b b y G a r A lp e ro v it z , p ag e 4 4 4."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 39 Atomic Bomb Lie “Necessary to save 100,000 lives.” Such an assault on over 100,000 human beings could be justified only in extreme conditions — in a situation where many more lives w ere saved by sacrificing those who died. Not just a “might have” or “could have” — but absolute evidence that nothing less than this horrific act could have saved the lives o f far more people. Killing Civilians “The U.S. never intentionally kills civilians.” Dre sden, Hiroshima, Tokyo bombing after Hiroshima. Maybe you or I wouldn’t kill civilians, but politic ians always find a good reason to do so. The justification came in an article by Henry L. St imson (Secretary of War at the time of the bombing) in Harper’s magazine in February 1947. In that article, Stimso n laid out the entire case to support dropping the bomb. At the he art of that case was the contention that the only alternative to dropping the bomb was an Am erican invasion of Japan that could have cost a million American lives or casualties. H e repeated that estimate in his autobiography, On Active Service : We estimated that if we should be forced to carry t his plan to its conclusion, the major fighting would not end until the latter p art of 1946, at the earliest. I was informed that such operations might be expect ed to cost over a million casualties to American forces along. Ever since then most Americans have assumed that dr opping the atomic bomb was the only alternative to a costly invasion of the Japane se homeland. The estimated number of casualties has varied with the telling — generally anywhere from 250,000 to a full million. President Harry Tru man on several occasions referred to the American lives saved by the dropping of the bom b, using various figures for the number of lives saved. . . . “It occurred to me that a quarter of a million of t he flower of our young manhood was worth a couple of Japanese cities, and I still think they were and are.”"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 40 “A year less of war will mean life for 300,000 — ma ybe a half million — of America’s finest youth.

It was his opinion that such an invasion would cost at a minimum one quarter of a million ca sualties, and might cost as much as a million, on the American side alone, w ith an equal number of the enemy. The other military and naval men present agreed.” 23 “The dropping of the bombs stopped the war, saved m illions of lives.” 24 However when Truman was writing his own memoirs, it was pointed out to him that Henry Stimson had used an estimate of a million cas ualties. To be consistent, Truman adopted that figure. Why not? It’s just a number th at can’t be proven or disproved — and the bigger, the better. The Myths Most Americans believe three things about the dropp ing of the atomic bomb, based on what they’ve heard over the past half-century: 1. Only two alternatives were available to the United States in 1945 to force the Japanese to surrender and end the war: in vade Japan with   21 S c en e f r om th e m o vi e T h e B e gi n ni n g o r t he En d , w it h T r um a n’ s d ia l og a p p ro v ed by T r u ma n . 22 S t at e me n t t o D em o cr a ti c se n at o rs an d C o ng r es sm e n , A pr i l 6 , 1 94 9 , i n Pu b l ic Pa p er s o f th e P r es i de n ts : H a rr y S .

An invasion would have cost hundreds of thousands o f American lives. 3. To avoid an invasion, the U.S. dropped two atomic b ombs on military targets. Given this understanding, it’s not surprising that most Americans believe the dropping of the bomb was justified. Unfortunately, the common wisdom is incomplete. In the summer of 1945 There actually were five alte rnatives, not two, being considered — each of which was assumed would end the war: 1. An invasion of Japan. 2. A continuation of the blockade of the Japanese isla nds, already in progress. 3. A declaration of war against Japan by the Soviet Un ion. 4. Use of the atomic bomb. 5. Modification of the surrender terms the Allies were demanding of Japan. Because so many world events of the half-century ha ve flowed from the use of the A- bomb, it’s important to be aware of how the events of 1945 differ so significantly from the common understanding. The fact is that the Pres ident and several top officials lied to the American people about the use of the bomb. So let’s look at each of the five alternatives. The Invasion of Japan An invasion of Japan was an obvious possibility. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 42 The American forces had been capturing Pacific isla nds in hard-fought battles with heavy casualties. In June of 1945, American troops comple ted the capture of Okinawa, the last major island south of Japan proper. It is easy to assume that the war wouldn’t end unti l the islands of Japan itself had been captured. The fall of Germany had occurred only a f ew months before — and it came about because of Allied ground forces converging on Germany from the East and West. However, the idea of invading Japan is clouded by t hree retrospective misconceptions: • that an invasion was necessary, • that it was imminent, and • that it would cost many American lives. In truth, almost no one in the American high comman d expected an invasion to take place. There were too many other alternatives avail able that wouldn’t cost American lives. Some quotes Secondly, although the American military was planni ng an invasion, just in case it proved to be necessary, the invasion wasn’t imminent. The general plan was that the first landing would take place in November 1945 at Kyushu near th e southern tip of the Japanese islands. A second invasion would occur at Honshu in the Japanese heartland the following May. And, third, the American high command made various estimates of the expected casualties. General Marshall the American Chief of Staff estimated that the invasion would cost about 31,000 American lives. Other estim ates in the same range were made by others in the know. None of them came anywhere n ear the figures tossed around by politicians in later years to justify the bombings. 25 The Blockade One reason that no one seriously expected an invasi on to be necessary was that the Japanese were slowing starving to death. All the Am ericans had to do was to wait until the Japanese surrendered as a matter of mere surviv al.   25 T h e D ec i si o n t o U se th e At o mi c B o mb by Ga r A lp e r ov i tz , p a ge 51 8 ."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 43 Called Operation Starvation. Japan is an island nation with virtually no natural resources. Even rice, the basic staple of the Japanese diet, is imported. The Japanese had to import most of the food and raw materials for manufacturing that they needed. When imported rice was no longer available, the government undertook a program to pr ocess acorns as a rice substitute. 26 But by early 1945 the Japanese navy had been destro yed. American ships could roam the Pacific Ocean without fear of encountering enemy fo rces. A naval blockade of the Japanese islands was establ ished. The Japanese couldn’t obtain the resources necessary for survival, let alone to wage war. The lack of coal meant an end of much of Japan’s in dustry. And the lack of basic industrial salts made it difficult to produce light metals, synthetic oil, or explosives. The shortage of products threatened to ignite a terribl e inflation. 27 Most people in the American high command assumed th e Japanese would surrender, merely to survive, long before the invasions were s cheduled. The Soviet Union The Soviet Union had remained neutral throughout th e Japanese-American war. However, Josef Stalin had promised the Americans th at the Soviets would enter the war against Japan once the Germans were defeated. And i n early April 1945, the Soviet Union gave notice to the Japanese that it would not honor its Neutrality Pact between them. 28 It was assumed that once the Soviets declared war o n Japan, the Japanese military would give up.

Lie #2: The atomic bomb had been dropped on a mili tary target. In announcing to the American people that the bomb had been dropped, President Harry Truman referred to Hiroshima as “an important Japanese Arm y base.” 29 And then on August 9, the day of the Nagasaki bombi ng, he stated: The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base. That was because we wished in this f irst attack to avoid, in so far as possible, the killing of civilians. 30 In fact, neither Hiroshima nor Nagasaki had any mil itary significance. The two cities were on a list of four cities that almost certainly were chosen simply because they were the only major cities still intact. If they had ser ved any military purpose, they would have been bombed into ashes long before. {Background on firebombing of Tokyo and other citie s.} It might be said that all factories could be consid ered military targets, because even those producing consumer goods free up other factories to produce war materials. But the only factories in Hiroshima were on the outskirts of the city, and the bomb was deliberately aimed at the center of the city in order to create the maximum damage possible. 31 Truman continued for the rest of his life to mainta in the fiction that the cities were military targets.   29 P u bl i c P ap e rs of th e P r e si d en t s: Ha r ry S.

And most of the scientists who worked on the bomb didn’t want it to be dropped on a city until after it had been demonstrated to the Japanese first, giving them a c hance to surrender. Why the second bomb on Nagasaki, before the Japanes e had a chance to surrender? Surrender Possibilities The war could have ended at least six months sooner if the U.S. had been willing to accept the Japanese desire for reassurance that the ir Emperor would not be removed or prosecuted. It may be difficult for us to understand, but the J apanese considered their Emperor to be more than just a King; he was a deity, the “Son of Heaven.” Hirohito was a direct descendant of the first Japanese Emperor, Jimmu in 660 B.C., who was considered to be a descendant of the goddess Amaterasu. To the Japan ese, unseating the Emperor amounted to far more than just a “regime change;” i t was sacrilege. 33 The Japanese also feared that the Emperor might be tried and hanged as a war criminal — which, at that time, was the widely expected fate f or Nazi leaders.

Also, it was understood t hat many Japanese soldiers would stop fighting only if the Emperor himself commanded them to do so — which meant that the fighting could end only if he remained in authority when surrender took place. 34 In January 1943 at the Casablanca conference of All ied leaders, Franklin Roosevelt casually mentioned at a press conference that the A llies would accept nothing less than “unconditional surrender.” The statement surprised Winston Churchill and members of the State Department in his entourage. 35 Roosevelt apparently thought it was a good idea bec ause he had read that Ulysses S. Grant had pronounced it in one of his Civil War cam paigns. The following month in a speech he repeated his new policy, saying, “We mean no harm to the common people of the Axis nations. But we do mean to impose punishment and retribution in full upon their guilty, barbaric lea ders.” 36 These statements inspired the Japanese to fight to the death, and just may have been the principal inspiration for the Kamikaze pilots who, starting in 1944, were willing to die by crashing their planes into American ships, rather t han let their Emperor be captured. 37 Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Harry S. Truman r eplaced him and assured America that he would continue all of Roosevelt’s policies — including the demand for unconditional surrender.

As we saw in the preceding chapter, they had broken the Japanese code before Pearl Harbor. 38 In August 11, 1944, a year before the atomic bomb w as dropped, the U.S. War Department reported to the President, “Foreign mini ster Shigemitsu has instructed Ambassador Sato [in Moscow] to find out whether Rus sia is willing to assist in bringing about a negotiated peace.” 39 Throughout the rest of 1944 and into 1945, the inte rcepted messages made it clear that the Japanese wanted to end the war, but they were d etermined that Emperor Hirohito must remain on the throne. In addition, various Jap anese officials sent out peace feelers to the Americans and British through the Russian, Port uguese, Swedish, and Swiss governments. The overtures requested meetings with Allied representatives, but the overtures were rebuffed. 40 On May 28, 1945, Acting Secretary of State Joseph C . Grew (who had been the U.S. Ambassador to Japan before the war) recorded a memo reporting on a meeting with President Truman: “The greatest obstacle to uncondi tional surrender by the Japanese is their belief that this would entail the destruction of permanent removal of the Emperor and the institution of the Throne. If some indicati on can now be given the Japanese that they themselves, when once thoroughly defeated and rendered impotent to wage war in the future, will be permitted to determine their ow n future political structure, they will be afforded a method of saving face without which surr ender will be highly unlikely . . . The President said that he was interested in what I sai d because his own thoughts had been following the same line.” Virtually every member of Truman’s cabinet, as well as Winston Churchill, urged Truman to modify and clarify the surrender terms. T he advisors also urged him to allow the Japanese at least five weeks from the time of m odifying the surrender terms before dropping the A-bomb. Truman himself said to associa tes on several occasions that he thought all this made sense. But he never did anyth ing about it. 41 On July 12, 1945, the U.S. intercepted this message from Foreign Minister Togo to Ambassador Sato in Moscow: “His Majesty the Emperor , mindful of the fact that the   38 T h e F or r es t al Di a ri e s b y J a me s V .

We now know without question that: • Any invasion of Japan would have cost in the neighb orhood of 10,000 - 30,000 lives — not the 250,000 - 1,000,000 bandied about by the politicians. • An invasion of Japan was very unlikely, given that the Japanese already were asking to surrender, given that the Soviets we re about to enter the war, and given that the Japanese people were slowly starving to death because of the sea blockade. • The planning for a possible invasion envisioned a s mall invasion at Kyoto that wasn’t even due to start until three mon ths after the atomic bombs were dropped, and a larger invasion nine mont hs after the bombs were dropped. • Before the first bomb was dropped, the Japanese had made it clear that they were willing to surrender on the same terms th at were eventually imposed when the surrender took place, but Harry Tr uman rejected the offer. • The Japanese intention to surrender was known becau se American cryptanalysts had broken the Japanese code over a y ear before Pearl Harbor, and were monitoring Japanese messages throu ghout the entire   42 T h e U .S . g o ve r nm e nt ’ s i nt e rc e pt e d J ap a ne s e me s s ag e s , $1 2 05 , J u ly 13 , 1 9 45 ; R G 4 5 7 , N .A ; q u ot e d i n T he D e c is i on to Us e t h e A to mi c Bo m b b y G ar Al p er o vi tz , pa g e 2 3."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 49 war. In addition, on August 2, 1945 at the Potsdam conference, Truman reviewed and rejected an open surrender offer made through the Soviets. • Contrary to what Truman said when announcing the ev ent and in numerous statements thereafter, neither bomb was dr opped on a military center. The cities were most likely chosen because they were about the only two large cities that hadn’t already been deva stated by American bombing. • Almost every top official — military or civilian — in the American war council was opposed to dropping the bomb without gi ving warning to the civilians in the target cities, without offering to avoid using the bomb if the Japanese would surrender, and without waiting t o see what other means might end the war first. The only exceptions were Secretary of State James Byrnes and President Harry Truman. • A majority of the scientists who worked on the bomb tried to petition the President to abstain from dropping the bomb on a po pulated city without first demonstrating it to the Japanese. • An overwhelming number of American military leaders and statesmen condemned the act of dropping the bomb as soon as t hey heard about it, in most cases saying it was totally unnecessary. IS THIS ALL HINDSIGHT? “We believe that a considerable portion of the Japa nese population now consider absolute military defeat to be probable. The increasing effe cts of sea blockade and the cumulative devastation wrought by strategic bombing, which has already rendered millions homeless and has destroyed from 25% to 50% of the built-up a rea of Japan’s most important cities, should make this realization increasingly general.” Combined U.S.-British Intelligence Committee July 8, 1945 43   43 T h e D ec i si o n t o U se th e At o mi c B o mb by Ga r A lp e r ov i tz , p a ge 17 ."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 50 REASON THE BOMB WAS DROPPED Trying to end war before Russians came in, and Chur chill’s belief that the bomb was dropped to scare Russia. This government program turned out to be just as su ccessful as all the others — meaning the result was far different from the expectations. The Soviets were obviously undeterred in their determination to gain control of most of e astern Europe. But, then, to a politician, results are never impor tant. The promises are that matter. If one can claim good intentions, one can’t be faulted. Why? What we don’t know for certain, and might never kno w, is why Harry Truman decided to drop the bomb. Because he told so many different st ories at different times, it is unlikely that anything he said at any time could be taken as authoritativ e proof of his thinking. Here are the possibilities, as I see them: • Although he had previously wanted the Soviets to jo in the war against Japan, the successful testing of the bomb meant tha t the Soviets were no longer needed — and he wanted to end the war before the Soviets entered it. (As it turned out, the bomb was dropped but the Soviets did enter the war anyway, and they got part of the boot y.) • He wanted to show the Soviets the awesome power of the bomb, thinking that would make them more pliable in the p ostwar world. (Churchill later said he believed this is the reaso n the bomb was dropped.) • There was a great deal of pressure from the militar y people working on the development of the bomb to actually use it — in order to justify the tremendous amount of money spent on the project. (M ajor General Leslie Groves, in charge of the project, suppressed the petition by the atomic scientists so that Truman didn’t see it befo re the bomb was dropped.)"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 51 • Truman believed that the dropping of the bomb would scare people worldwide into avoiding future wars. • Truman actually believed what he said many times — that dropping the bomb was justified as an attack of revenge for the attack on Pearl Harbor and because of the atrocities committed against Ame rican soldiers — even though the people killed by the bomb weren’t t he people responsible for those crimes. You may agree with one or more of these potential r easons. But we still have to face the fact that the politicians never offered any of thes e reasons to the American people. Had any of them been true, the politicians could have u sed them and avoided having to issue justifications that were demonstrably untrue. So what was the reason that the bomb was dropped? We probably will never know for sure. I have only my own opinion, one that I can’t prove is correct. Virtually everyone in the decision-making picture i n the U.S., civilian or military, agreed that guaranteeing the survival of the emperor would bring the war to a halt quickly. It was the obvious answer to end the hostilities immediate ly — with no further loss of American lives, no further loss of Japanese lives, no worrie s over the consequences of bringing the Russians into the war, and no moral agony over drop ping the atomic bomb. Save The Emperor So why wasn’t the save-the-emperor alternative chos en? We can’t find the answer in any of Truman’s stateme nts. He contradicted himself so often that any statement you find can be offset by some other statement he made. My guess is that it was because Harry Truman was a hothead. Egged on by Secretary of State Byrnes, who wanted to have the A-bomb “in his pocket” when dealing with the Russians, Truman decided to end the war in a very d ramatic and ill-thought-out way. If that seems a harsh judgment on Truman, we should consider some of the other things he did in his nearly eight years as President — whi ch we will do in chapter 5.

Yes, it’s possible that all other alternatives coul d have turned out to be fruitless — leaving the U.S. with only the choices of dropping the bomb or undertaking a land invasion of Japan. All these things are possible, but we’ll never know how realistic those possibilities were because the bombs were dropped without waiting to f ind out . No warning was given to the Japanese. No modificati on of the surrender terms were ever offered. The bombs were simply dropped. A-bomb No More Savage Than Blockade or Bombings Some historians have maintained, and reasonably so, that the A-bomb was no more destructive or savage than the firebombing of Japan ese cities and the blockade that was slowly starving the Japanese to death.

And one thing is clear: by the time th e A-bomb was dropped, there was no more need for any such destructive approach. The Japanese had made i t clear they were ready to surrender on the very terms the U.S. impos ed upon them. Happy the U.S. Had the Bomb Some supporters of the U.S. dropping the A-bomb hav e taken the attitude that we are fortunate that it was America that developed and us ed the bomb first — that America had the power possession of the bomb endowed. If by that they mean this meant the next bomb was m ore likely to be dropped on Moscow than Chicago, they’re most likely right. But if they believe the power that bomb-possession provided was used more benevolently because it was the U.S. that had it, they’re probab ly wrong.

The second would come after The Dangerous World Continues, if that chapter is neces sary; otherwise, after the Gulf War. I was 12 years old when World War II ended and the Cold War began. I was old enough to be interested in world events that were reported on evening radio news broadcasts and in the daily newspaper. I was aware of President Tr uman’s condemnation of the Soviet Union’s actions in the late 1940s. Like most Americans of my generation, I spent 45 ye ars living in fear — fear of a nuclear war, fear of communist subversion, fear that the “f ree world” was gradually shrinking. Introduction The Soviet Union was a ruthless, brutal nation in w hich millions of people were killed by their own government. But while it served the purposes of the Soviet lead ers, it also served the purposes of American politicians. The overriding lie about the Cold War was in exagge rating the threat that the Soviets posed to America: • At the end of World War II, a time when the Soviet Union was so devastated it couldn’t possibly wage war against an y major power, U.S. politicians scared Americans into believing that th e Soviets were planning to attack Europe. It is quite likely that the Cold War might have been much less heated if our politicians hadn’t don e so much to fan the flames."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 57 • Throughout the Cold War, U.S. politicians constantl y exaggerated both the economic strength and the military might of the Soviet Union. • Although we were warned repeatedly that the communi sts were engaging in subversive activities aimed at the over throw of the U.S. government, our own government was engaging in subv ersive activities in dozens of countries around the world — attemptin g to influence elections, overthrow elected governments, or stave off rebellions.

And yet, at the same time the U.S. government was trying to rig ele ctions in places like Italy and France, helping to overthrow governments in countries like Iran and Panama, and intervening militarily in nations like Greece and Vietnam. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 58 Of course, only rarely did the politicians tell us about these activities; most of the time it was the CIA or another government agency working in secret. CIA’s Role It would be easy to assume that the only role of th e Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) would be to gather intelligence — engage in espiona ge, analyze activities in foreign countries, and such. But the Agency’s charter authorizes it, in addition to gathering intelligence, to perform “such other functions and duties related to intelli gence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to time direct.” In practice this has been taken to authorize the CI A to engage in secret operations, both civilian and paramilitary, to influence the outcome of foreign elections, to overthrow foreign rulers, to help put down rebellions in othe r countries, and to do virtually anything the President of the United States thinks might be to America’s benefit. The CIA also bought or started newspapers, wire ser vices, and other news organizations around the world — to be used to spread American pr opaganda covertly. It even had American journalists on its payroll; the journalist s weren’t paid to gather intelligence (as in “Central Intelligence Agency”), but to print new s reports that the CIA wanted disseminated. All this despite the fact that the CI A’s charter clearly prohibited it from engaging in activities within the U.S. 47 One of its goals was to create the illusion that an y organization promoting “peace” was subversive. I can remember myself how successful th is was. In the 1950s and 1960s we automatically assumed that any organization with th e word “peace” or “disarmament” in its name was a communist front. Behind the Iron Curtain We are privy to much that went on in the secret cou ncils of the American government, because of the Freedom of Information Act and the m emoirs of various participants. Thus there is a great deal of information available abou t operations by the CIA and other government agencies that were secret at the time th ey were carried out.

But we can only speculate co ncerning the motives and concerns of Soviet leaders — although some Soviet files have be en opened in recent years. However, it is generally assumed that at the end of World War II Josef Stalin was feeling somewhat insecure about the future of the Soviet Un ion. The country had been invaded by the Nazis, devastated by World War II, and now h ad to divert an enormous amount of resources to reconstruction. Stalin’s hope apparently was to create a buffer zon e in front of the USSR — so that a future invading army would encounter massive resist ance before reaching the Soviet border. The last thing he wanted at the end of World War II was to go to war again. Their country was devastated, and Stalin instructed the Communist Parties around the world to help the Soviet Union rebuild, rather than push to take over other countries. He especially wanted to cooperate with the Allies i n order to get reparations from the Germans. Afghan War, 1980s See article in \\Afghanistan\\Bad consequences . . .

Truman Attitude toward the Soviets "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 60 When the Russians missed a deadline to withdraw the ir troops from Iran in early 1946, Truman bullied them into hurrying up — telling his Secretary of State James Byrnes, “I’m tired of babying the Soviets.” 48 German Zones & Soviet Occupation At the end of World War II, Germany was divided int o four occupation zones — administered by the American, British, French, and Soviet authorities. In July 1946 the Americans offered to combine their zone with that of any of the other three governments. Only the British agreed and a co mbined zone, called Bizonia, was created. The Soviets considered this the first step to creat ing a powerful new German state. This may have been the final motivation for the Soviets to remain in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, rather than withdrawing as originally pla nned. 49 The Truman Doctrine & Greece In 1947 the Greek government faced the possibility of a civil war with communist insurgents, many of whom had been part of the Greek resistance against the Nazis. Truman decided to send money and weapons to the Gre ek government, and the Truman Doctrine was born. It was a policy of aiding anyone fighting against a communist insurrection. Whitewashing Dictators One of the recurring lies of the Cold War was the p ractice of painting anyone who opposed the communists as a great leader of a free country — no matter how oppressed the people in his country were.

The Mujahadeen were essentially a group of warlords and terrorists, who fought among themselves until the Taliban came to power and united the country. That doesn’t mean their communist enemies ran Parad ises. It simply means that the black-and-white pictures painted by our government — holding up dictators as great Freedom Fighters — was misleading and led to great public confusion in the U.S. when the true natures of those regimes began to surface.

Cold War Myth The over-riding myth of the Cold War was the belief in an international communist conspiracy compromised of dedicated, disciplined ag ents who slavishly followed orders dictated from Moscow — orders given as part of a pl ot to take over the world. The liberals believed that communist discipline was exercised over communist governments that would invade non-communist countri es and thereby expand the communist empire. The conservatives believed that communist disciplin e was exercised within “free” countries by subversives who would work to overthro w the governments of those countries and replace them with communist governmen ts. Both were mistaken. This can be demonstrated both t heoretically and factually. An international conspiracy requires that millions of people subordinate their own desires and needs for the benefit of some far-off dictator. But human beings aren’t made that way. For example, after 1949, Mao-Tse Tung was the virtu al emperor of China. He had totalitarian control over the largest population in the world. Why would he sacrifice his own desires and ambitions so that the world might b e ruled from Moscow eventually? The same would be true for the ruler of any third-w orld country. His first consideration would be the wealth, perks, and power afforded him by his position — not the eventual triumph of communism worldwide. Of course, many of these rulers would support the S oviet Union and cooperate with it — in exchange for money or protection against foreign and domestic enemies. But that didn’t make them dedicated agents of a conspiracy t o bring about a communist world. And the same is true of pro-communist individuals i n non-communist countries. Many of them become petty rulers of their own groups and de velop their own agendas. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 63 Of course, there always will be fanatics who will s acrifice their own lives for a cause, hoping thereby to give meaning to an otherwise mean ingless life, but such people are not likely to be very intelligent or efficient instrume nts of a master plan. American Communists as Agents? There is one example cited over and over again to p rove the case that Communist Parties around the world were disciplined agents of the cen tral conspiracy in Moscow. That example is the reaction of American communists to t he Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1940. In 1939 World War II began when the Germans and Sov iets signed a non-aggression pact. Shortly afterward, the Germans invaded wester n Poland, and a few weeks later the Soviets invaded eastern Poland. Because Britain and France had mutual-defense treaties with Poland, they immediately declared war against Germany (but not against the Soviet Union). Although no one knew that a Holocaust was coming, t he Nazis’ repressive policies against the Jews were already common knowledge. And so some people in the United States wanted America to intervene against the Nazi s. But American Communists pushed adamantly for America to remain out of European aff airs. However, in August 1940 the Nazis turned on the Sov iets and invaded Russia. Immediately, American Communists began pushing for the U.S. to enter the war against Germany. This turnabout by American Communists is often cite d as proof that they did whatever the Soviet Union ordered them to do. But there’s an enormous difference between such dis cipline and simply being sympathetic to and loyal to the Soviet Union. The A merican communists’ attitude was no different from that of American Democrats or Republ icans who will defend and promote anyone on their own side while attacking anyone in the other party. For example, Republicans complained when Bill Clint on ordered the American military to bomb Serbia in 1999. Among other reasons for opp osition, they cited the futility of intervening in foreign countries, the unconstitutio nality of going to war without a declaration by Congress, and the possibility of pol itical motives driving Clinton’s decisions. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 64 But when George Bush bombed Afghanistan and Iraq, R epublicans cheered. They didn’t bother to discuss the past futility of foreign inte rvention, or the constitutional requirement for a formal declaration of war by Congress, or how the attacks boosted George Bush’s political popularity. Do you think the Republicans were acting on orders from George Bush or the Republican National Committee? It is a mistake to confuse sympathy and loyalty to some person or entity — even a foreign power — for disciplined obedience to orders. As we’ll see in this chapter, the Soviet rulers in Moscow weren’t very successful in controlling the rulers in their satellite states or the local Communist parties in non- communist states. TRUMAN’S WARNING In January 1951, President Truman said publicly: If Western Europe were to fall to Soviet Russia, it would double the Soviet supply of coal and triple the Soviet supply of stee l. If the countries of Asia and Africa should fall to Soviet Russia, we would l ose the sources of many of our raw materials, including uranium, which is t he basis of our atomic power. And Soviet command of the free nations of Eu rope and Asia would confront us with military forces when we could neve r hope to equal. In such a situation the Soviet Union could impose its deman ds on the world, without resort to conflict, simply through the preponderanc e of its economic and military power. 50 Republican vs. Democratic Approach Republicans stressed internal security problems, wh ile the Democrats stressed threat of Soviets conquering countries and starting a war.   50 P u bl i c P ap e rs of th e P r e si d en t s: Ha r ry S.

BRUTAL ALLIES & ENEMIES It is hard for Americans to realize that people wit hin many countries are raised in a culture of brutality — with the idea that enemies a re evil, mercy is weakness, and brutality is perfectly justified against evil peopl e. We are fortunate that this culture hasn’t predomina ted in America, although there are some people who practice it, and there have been so me periods when politicians have been able to sell it. Fortunately, America is a strong country, capable o f defending itself without question. It can coexist in a world with cultures of all kinds. We don’t have to make foreign brutality our problem. But our foreign policy experts have decided to use that brutality to advance what they perceive as American interests. They align themselv es with brutal leaders — against those leaders’ internal enemies or against other na tions. They finance and use those leaders for the purposes of American foreign policy . And when a leader’s usefulness is ended, they use his brutality as justification to a bandon him or depose him — and perhaps even kill him.

The American military was still in Japan, and Presi dent Harry Truman ordered General Douglas MacArthur, the U.S. Far Eastern commander, to send troops to Korea to repel the Northern invaders. The following day, the United Nations Security Coun cil passed a U.S. resolution calling on UN member states to assist South Korea. The UN, in effect, delegated to the U.S. the United Nations response to the invasion. And the Americans controlled the UN forces throughout t he entire war. American Response President Truman ordered the military to expel the North Korean army from the south, but not to cross the 38th parallel and not to bomb military targets in North Korea. Despite the President’s order, General MacArthur on his own authorized air attacks against North Korea, and Truman relented and gave him the belated authorization. 58 Meanwhile, South Korean and American troops continu ed to retreat. And by the end of July, just one month into the war, the UN troops ha d been pushed all the way back to the port of Pusan at Korea’s southern tip. There they w ere able to stop the North Korean advance. The Tide Turns On September 15, 1950, MacArthur engineered a darin g sea landing by UN forces at Inchon, 180 miles behind the North Korean lines. Fr om there, the UN troops retook Seoul — and by October they had pushed the North Koreans back to the 38th parallel.   58 A n ot h er Su c h V ic t or y b y Ar n ol d A .

But on Septem ber 29, 1950, President Truman gave MacArthur the go-ahead to cross the 38th paral lel, invade North Korea, and bring about the unification of Korea. A week later Americ a secured belated UN approval for invading North Korea. 59 Truman’s advisors were confident that neither the S oviets nor the Chinese would send troops to rescue North Korea’s government. The Chin ese had declared repeatedly that they wouldn’t tolerate an anti-communist regime on their border, but the Americans assumed the Chinese were bluffing. 60 UN troops crossed the 38th parallel, and encountere d little resistance. By October 19, 1950, they had captured Pyongyang, North Korea’s ca pital. When MacArthur’s forces approached the Yalu River a t the border between North Korea and China, they were surprised by Chinese troops on the Korean side of the border. The Chinese government claimed these were volunteers wh o had offered to help the North Koreans. Still convinced that the Soviets wouldn’t get invol ved and that there were too few Chinese to worry about, MacArthur convinced Preside nt Truman to continue supporting the drive to the Chinese border, to occupy all of N orth Korea, and to reunify Korea. 61 The Tide Turns again But, in fact, the American drive to the Yalu River was part of a trap the Chinese had been planning. The North Koreans and Chinese engulfed th e Americans and drove them back down the Korean peninsula — quickly retaking Pyongy ang, the North Korean capital. Within a week the Americans were back almost to the 38th parallel. 62 MacArthur was still as optimistic as ever, promisin g on November 24, 1950, that American troops would be home by Christmas. 63 But the Chinese and North Korean troops continued pushing the UN forces deep into So uth Korea again.   59 E n cy c lo p ed i a B ri t an n ic a 20 0 1 , CD - RO M e d it i on , “ Ko r ea , H i st o ry of .” 60 T h e S pe c te r o f C o mm u ni s m b y M e lv y n P .

At that point Truman lowered his objective to simpl y keeping the North Koreans and Chinese out of South Korea. The war became stalemat ed, with both sides locked near the 38th parallel. But General MacArthur still intended to unify Korea . He advocated blockading and bombing China and enlisting the Nationalist Chinese forces on Taiwan. He allowed his differences with President Truman to be made public , and Truman fired him on April 11, 1951. 64 Ending the War Armistice talks began in July 1951. The most contentious issue was whether prisoners of war should be returned by force to their home countries. A forced return was required by the Geneva Conventions on war, but the U.S. was opposed to the idea. The talks and the war dragged on for two more years. Americans had supported the war at the outset, but by 1952 they had grown weary of it. When Dwight Eisenhower ran for President in 1952, h e promised to go to Korea to find a way to end the war. He won the election and he kept his promise, but his trip to Korea achieved little. On March 5, 1953, Josef Stalin died and was replace d by Georgi Malenkov, who wanted to end the war so that he could focus on domestic p roblems. By then, everyone seemed to want the war to end — the Eisenhower administration , the Soviets, the Chinese, and the North Koreans, everyone but Syngman Rhee. He threat ened to release the 100,000 or so Communist POWs if the U.S. didn’t keep fighting unt il Korea was unified. Despite Rhee’s objections, an armistice was finally signed on July 27, 1953.

THE RHEE GOVERNMENT Lie #1, Good vs. Evil: South Korea was “Free Korea” and Syngman Rhee was the great democratic patriot who was trying to save his country from the evil communists. Rhee was no democrat and no patriot. In fact, while U.S. officials were praising him in public, they privately considered him a dangerous l iability — a loose cannon who had to be restrained. Near the end of the war, the U.S. go vernment had contingency plans to attack South Korean military forces, depose Rhee, a nd assassinate him if necessary. 66   65 T r uc e T e nt an d F i gh t in g Fr o nt by Wa l te r G .

He probably wouldn’t have been reelected in 1952 if he hadn’t imposed marital law and used the police to produce a victory. 68 Rhee’s government included individuals who had coll aborated with the Japanese occupiers, and his police executed political prison ers without trial. 69 It was even against the law for any South Korean to speak well of Commu nist North Korea. 70 Rhee’s government had bloody hands. When the Japane se departed in 1945, the people of Cheju, an island off Korea’s coast, set up their ow n government. On April 3, 1948, Rhee’s South Korean police fired into a Cheju crowd rallying to commemorate the end of Japanese rule. The island rose in rebellion, and Rh ee’s police eventually slaughtered more than 30,000 people — about 10% of the island’s population. Most of the island’s villages were burned to the ground. Until the late 1990s, it was against the law for an y South Korean to even mention the Cheju massacre. In 1995 — almost 50 years after the fact — a government investigation publicized the bloody details. 71 In 1960 a national rebellion overthrew the Rhee’s g overnment. 72 But all through the war, Rhee was characterized by the U.S. government and the American press as a great leader who was fighting f or the freedom of the Korean people.

There was virtually no re cognition of the historical context in which the war occurred. It was simply assumed that an evil country had attacked a free country. President Truman referred to it as “unprovoked aggr ession” and “lawless action.” 73 In truth, Syngman Rhee was just as determined to at tack North Korea and reunite the country under his rule. Indeed Rhee was so belliger ent prior to the war that American officials had refused to arm the South Koreans. 74 On May 3, 1949 (a year before the war began), North Korean military forces crossed the 38th parallel for the first time. The incident didn ’t lead to much fighting, but it did inspire two battalions of unhappy South Korean soldiers to defect to the North. Over the following year there was almost continual fighting of one sort or another along the North-South border. It was only a matter of tim e until full-scale war broke out. The North Korean invasion was no surprise to American o fficials. In fact, U.S military intelligence had seen the massing of North Korean t roops on the 38th parallel. The U.S. could have rushed troops to South Korea to prevent the invasion, but chose not to. On January 12, 1950, U.S. Secretary of State Dean A cheson gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he defined America’s d efense perimeter.

No politicians or journalists discussed it. It was simply assumed that the North Korean invasion was part of the evil Communists’ plans to take over the world. THE WORLD AT STAKE Lie #3, The domino effect: If we don’t stop the com munists in Korea, other countries will fall and they’ll take over most of t he world — leaving the U.S. isolated and facing an overwhelming foe. As Tr uman said, “We are fighting in Korea so that we won’t have to fight in Wichita.” 79 Later Truman justified sending American troops to K orea: Communism was acting in Korea just as Hitler, Musso lini, and the Japanese had acted ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I f this was allowed to go unchallenged it would mean a third world war. 80 On June 27 Truman told some Congressmen, “If we let Korea down, the Soviets will keep right on going and swallow up one piece of Asi a after another” — continuing on to the Middle East and Europe. 81 He asserted that by fighting back, the U.S. not onl y would stop the dominos from falling, it would prove to the Soviets that further aggressi ons would be pointless.

General James A. Van Fleet, the United Nations commander at the end of the war, said: Korea has been a blessing. There had to be a Korea either here or some place in the world. 83 And Ambassador Charles Bohlen later said, “It was t he Korean War and not World War II that made us a world political-military power.” 84 Soviet Attitude Historians are divided on how Stalin felt about Nor th Korea’s invasion of the South. There’s evidence he tried to dissuade Kim Il Sung f rom invading, but that he wanted the Communist Chinese to help the North Koreans in any conflict with the South. Once the Korean War began, the Soviets provided military sup plies and advisors. 85 But there are reasons to believe Stalin was opposed to the invasion — and probably was surprised at its timing. In January 1950 the Soviets walked out of the Unite d Nations Security Council to protest the UN’s refusal to give Chiang Kai-shek’s seat to the Communist Chinese government. Consequently, the Soviets weren’t in the UN at the time of the Korean invasion — and so the U.S. was able to get the Security Council to ap prove UN action to repel the North Koreans. Had the Soviets known of the invasion in advance, t hey would have stayed at the UN to use their veto to stop any plans for the UN to resi st the North Koreans.   82 N o te s o f G e or g e E ls e y, J un e 2 6 , 1 95 0 , b ox 71 o f th e G e or g e M .

But there was no way for Stalin to anticipate that the U.S. was willing to go to war with or without a UN resolution. In fact, as we saw, Americ an officials had stated publicly that they didn’t consider Korea to be worth defending. No matter how Stalin felt about the invasion, it’s obvious that neither Kim Il Sung nor Mao Tse-tung was a puppet of Moscow — dancing to St alin’s orders. Kim Il Sung cooperated with the Soviets to get mili tary equipment and other support in fighting the South Koreans as well as his own polit ical opponents in the North. But he wasn’t on call to do Stalin’s bidding. 86 In addition, the Soviets were still trying not to r ock the boat — hoping that Truman’s plan to greatly increase military spending would be rejected by Congress. They also didn’t want to give the U.S. a pretext to attack th e Soviet Union itself. As we saw in the previous chapter, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligenc e agencies were well aware of the Soviet determination to avoid war with America. As a result of the War Scare of the late 1940s, a m ajority of Americans believed Truman’s pitch that America had to fight in Korea. If not, we’d eventually be left with no allies, and we’d have to surrender to Communist dom ination. But whatever the Korean War was, there’s no evidenc e that it was conceived as part of a Soviet master plan to take over the world. POLICE ACTION Lie #4, The Truman Administration acted Constitutio nally: Everything Truman did was legal and constitutional. President Truman sent American troops into battle w ithout bothering to ask Congress for a declaration of war — merely reporting to Congress what he had done. When confronted with this Constitutional point, he said the Korean conflict wasn’t a war, it was a “police action” — coining an expression th at has served war-fighting Presidents for the past half-century. No one believed him at t he time, and the conflict has always been known as “The Korean War.”   86 C e nt u ry of Wa r b y G a br i e l K ol k o, pa g e 3 99 ."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 81 Senator Robert A. Taft warned that if Truman were a llowed to send American soldiers into battle without a declaration of war, future Pr esidents “could send troops to . . . Indo- China or anywhere else in the world, without the sl ightest voice of Congress in the matter.” 87 Few people took him seriously, although journalist James Reston called Truman’s bypassing of Congress a “transformation of the spirit of the United States government.” 88 How right he was. Truman frequently justified the lack of a Congressi onal declaration of war by citing the United Nations Security Council vote as his authori zation — even though he had ordered U.S. troops into battle before the UN resolution. 89 Even if he had waited for UN authorization, the U.S . Constitution gives Congress ~ not the UN ~ the power to commit the U.S. to a war. In fact, the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 included a requirement that Congress mu st approve any UN use of American forces (a provision that has been violated frequent ly). The UN Charter itself says that member nations can commit troops only consistently with their “respective constitutional processes.” 90 Truman’s actions were unconstitutional and authorit arian — no matter what he called them. SAVING THE COUNTRY Lie #5, America saved South Korea: By its intervent ion, the U.S. saved South Korea. America did repel the Communist invaders. But it ce rtainly didn’t save the country.

Atlee asked Truman to put his promise in writing. Truman told him, “If a man’s wo rd isn’t any good, it isn’t made any better by writing it down” — the classic intimidati on tactic of a con man. 103 Just prior to firing MacArthur, Truman had authoriz ed the transfer of nine atomic bombs to Strategic Air Command planes on Guam and Okinawa . 104 And when Dwight Eisenhower became President in 1953 , he also was prepared to use the atomic bomb if the North Koreans wouldn’t sign an a rmistice. 105   100 Me m or a nd u m o f D ea n R us k , D e ce m be r 1 9 , 1 95 0 ; ci t e d i n A no t he r S u ch Vi ct o r y b y A r n ol d A .

Because the atomic weapons weren’t actually used, Truman rewrote his p revious statements and denied that he had ever intended to use the bomb — saying in hi s farewell address, “We are not made that way; we are a moral people.” 106 And it wasn’t just the bomb. Truman was as rabidly anti-communist as MacArthur. In his diary he fantasized about an “all out war” in which the U.S. wiped out every large Soviet and Chinese city. 107 If MacArthur was a loose cannon, Truman was a loose battleship. BATTLE-READY TROOPS Lie #8, The brave American troops: The American tro ops were well prepared and fought bravely against larger numbers. The truth is that American troops were sent into ba ttle ill-equipped and ill-prepared physically and mentally — a common occurrence in Am erican wars. The military draft (conscription) was terminated wh en World War II ended in 1945, but it was reinstated during Truman’s War Scare in 1948. 108 The troops that went to Korea in 1950 were mostly draftees who in many cases had onl y eight weeks of basic training. I was drafted in May 1953. Fortunately for me, the war ended just as I was coming out of basic training. My training in no way prepared me for what I would have faced in Korea. During basic training I fired my rifle only twice. No preparatio n was given for fighting in a Korean winter. Basic training was more like a Boy Scout ca mp from Hell — with drill sergeants demeaning the troops but teaching them little that could help them win a war or even survive one.   106 Ja n ua r y 1 5, 19 5 3; Th e P u bl i c P ap e rs of Ha r ry S .

The troops that went to Korea in 1950 would have been even less battle ready, and the evi dence bears that out. Brainwashing One of the legends of the Korean War was “brainwash ing.” Lie #9, Brainwashing: Well-prepared American troops were staunchly anti- communist, but were subjected to diabolical brainwa shing sessions. It was said that the North Koreans applied psycholo gical pressure on the American POWs (Prisoners of War) to convince them that the C ommunists were right and the Americans were wrong. But of the roughly 7,000 Amer ican prisoners, only a few of them were said to come back from Korea as communists. However, what was not reported until long after the end of the war was the passivity of the American prisoners — who were utterly unprepare d for the possibility of being taken prisoner. American POW’s were kept in what might be called “m inimum security” facilities, but not a single UN prisoner bothered to escape. About 40% of the Americans died in captivity, mostly from despair — not from starvatio n or brutality. There seems little doubt that their despair was largely due to a lack of understanding of why they were fighting. A majority of them collaborated in some way with th e enemy — by sending letters home denouncing the United States or making broadcasts f or the enemy. There was virtually no discipline in the chain of command among the prison ers. 109 When the war ended, the military censors forbade th e returning POWs from talking privately to journalists about their experiences in captivity. Any interviews had to be conducted with a censor and counter-intelligence ag ent present. 110   109 Le t te r t o t h e L on d on T i m es , N o ve m be r 2 5 , 1 97 1, b y C .

When the war began, it was assumed that Americans w ould fight as they had in World War II — with American ground troops advancing up t he Korean peninsula until North Korea was conquered. But Korea isn’t France, and fi ghting in a Third World country was something quite new for American military of the 19 50s. The Americans assumed that their superior firepower was sufficient for victory, that the South Koreans would do most of the actual fighting, that neither China nor the Soviet Union would enter the war, and that the North Korea ns would welcome the American “liberators.” All these assumptions proved false. CENSORSHIP The lies were easy to sell to the American people b ecause Americans heard very little that the Truman administration and the military did n’t want them to hear. There was no press censorship in the early days of the war, but the military asked reporters to adhere to a voluntary code. This was m erely a request that reporters not reveal anything that might give useful information to the enemy — something no reporter was likely to do anyway. With no formal censorship, early news reports told of panic-stricken young GIs who were out of their depth in Korea. Some reporters filed r eports of American retreats that turned into routs, soldiers who couldn’t bring themselves to fire their rifles, and severe shortages of equipment. The Army didn’t need censorship to keep the reporte rs in line. The newsmen were dependent upon the Army for transportation, housing , and even facilities for transmitting their reports home.

MacArthur’s headquarters accused them of hurting troop morale a nd giving comfort to the enemy. And on July 25, 1950, just one month after the star t of the war, the Army amended the voluntary code to prohibit any criticism of decisio ns made by United Nations field commanders or of conduct by the soldiers. 111 Once MacArthur’s drive to capture all of North Kore a was halted by Chinese troops in November 1950, it became apparent that the war wasn ’t going to be short. And from that point on, U.S. forces strove to put a smiley face o n the conflict. MacArthur denied that the Chinese entry into the wa r was a problem. And the Army and Air Force began issuing bulletins that reported spe cific numbers of enemy casualties — something they couldn’t possibly know with any prec ision. But lacking alternative information, the press reported the inflated figure s to the public. The war correspondents eventually became more aggre ssive. They began writing about the inability of the UN troops — the South Koreans in particular — to stand up to the North Korean and Chinese armies. Korean Oppression They also zeroed in on the corruption and repressio n of Syngman Rhee’s government. They wrote of the toxic black-market liquor sold to American troops, the alarming number of South Korean army deserters, and the summ ary execution of over 2,000 political prisoners shot by South Korean soldiers a nd police during the first few weeks of the war. 112 Peter Webb of the United Press wrote: White-helmeted military police — their nationality is not known — with orders to keep UN troops at a distance, stood guard today while a South Korean firing squad executed another batch of priso ners on Seoul’s   111 Th e F i rs t C a su a lt y b y P h il l ip Kn i gh t le y , p ag es 3 66 - 36 7 . 112 Ne w Y o rk Ti m es , A p ri l 2 1 , 2 00 0 , p ag e A 6 ; c it ed i n T he Fi f ty - Ye a r W ou nd b y D er e k L e e ba e rt , p a ge 93 ."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 89 “Execution Hill,” according to eye-witnesses.

[A B ritish soldier said] “It was just mass murder.” 113 Other journalists began reporting about the atrocit ies they witnessed — and of seeing British troops intervening to stop South Korean sol diers from executing South Korean civilians. Australian Alan Dower of The Melbourne Herald repor ted that in Seoul he came across a column of women, some carrying babies, being escort ed by South Korean policemen. He asked what was going on and was told, “These Commun ists, they go to be shot, executed.” When asked how the police knew they were Communists, a policeman told Dower, “People say. People in street point and say that person Communist.” Dower followed the column to a prison, where he sto pped the executions by threatening the warden with a gun. He then pressured UN officia ls to stop the executions by promising that if they did, he’d withhold the story of what he’d seen. 114 However, other correspondents were reporting the So uth Korean atrocities they’d seen. The reports created widespread revulsion in the U.S . and Britain, and support for the war in America began to erode rapidly. Full Censorship The military command reacted by silencing the messe nger. On December 21, 1950, MacArthur’s headquarters impo sed full military censorship on the reporters. Everything — press reports, photogra phs, newsreel footage, broadcasts — had to be approved by the censors before it could b e transmitted home. No “derogatory comments” could be made about the UN troops, the co mmanders, or the way the war was being conducted. The correspondents were now comple tely under the jurisdiction of the Army, and punishments — including the possibility o f court-martial — were threatened for disobedience. 115   113 Th e Y o rk s hi r e P os t , De c e mb e r 1 8, 19 5 0; ci t ed i n Th e F i rs t C a su a lt y b y P h il l ip K n i gh t le y , p ag e s 3 74 - 37 5. 114 Le t te r f r om Al a n D ow er t o P hi l li p K n ig h tl e y, J a n ua r y 4 , 1 97 4 , q uo t ed i n Th e F i rs t C a s ua l ty by Ph i ll i p K ni gh t l ey , p a ge s 3 7 5- 3 76 . 115 Th e F i rs t C a su a lt y b y P h il l ip Kn i gh t le y , p ag es 3 45 - 34 5 ."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 90 The rationale, of course, was that a free press cou ld unwittingly reveal information to the enemy.

Peter Webb, the UP reporter, was arrested merely fo r reporting that General Walton H. Walker had died in a jeep accident. Other correspon dents were expelled from Korea when they wrote negatively about the American war e ffort. 117 And so Americans at home heard no more about South Korean atrocities, about black- market rackets, about untrained and unprepared U.S. soldiers being routed, about the bad feeling among troops of the different nations fight ing North Korea, about American soldiers getting hooked on drugs, 118 about ill-treatment of refugees by South Koreans a nd Americans, or about American jets that bombed Greek or British troops by mistake. 119 No articles were published in America questioning t he strategic decisions of American commanders — such as MacArthur’s march into the Chi nese trap early in the war. It was almost fifty years later that newly declassi fied military documents revealed that American officers had witnessed some of the executi ons of political prisoners by South Korean soldiers and police. 120 Napalm bombing, which later became infamous in Viet nam, was first used by the U.S. in Korea. Napalm destroys foliage and human beings thr ough fire and intense heat. But napalm was seen as a horror during the Vietnam War partly because Americans thought its use was unprecedented.

Even when reports managed to get through to the hom e front, newspaper and broadcast editors in the U.S. and Britain often killed the st ories. Either they thought they were doing their patriotic duty or they refused to issue negative reports on a war they unanimously supported. For example, when BBC reporter Rene Curforth sent h ome a broadcast describing a napalm attack he had witnessed, the BBC refused to broadcast it. 121 The situation was similar in America. General MacAr thur remembered fondly a letter he received from the managing editor of the Chicago Tr ibune early in the war, saying that the paper had already imposed self-censorship and w ould not publish anything derogatory about the American effort. MacArthur — w ho apparently had strange ideas about the word “free” — wrote in his memoirs that t he Tribune’s self-censorship demonstrated that “a free press exhibited its fulle st commitment to the burdens of a free society.” 122 In addition, many of the reporters on the scene wer e unwilling to look too hard for the truth. They simply repackaged and sent home whateve r the military authorities gave them. War by press release didn’t start in the 21st century; it’s almost as old as war itself.

They became buddies with the soldiers and were reluctant to report anything negativism about them. Most soldiers looked down on the Koreans, and the r eporters shared their attitude. The brutality of the South Korean police and soldiers c aused the Americans to think of all Koreans — the “gooks” — as less than human. Strict censorship was imposed during the lengthy ar mistice talks. Reporters weren’t allowed even to talk to the UN negotiators, and so no one really knew what each side was asking for. Thus it wasn’t revealed until after the war that negotiations had dragged on for so long because the UN negotiators had been demandi ng that the border be moved 32 miles north of the 38th parallel. Instead, the negotiators posted a map falsely indic ating that the North Koreans were delaying the armistice by making unrealistic demand s. 124 JUSTIFYING GOVERNMENT EXPANSION Although the war changed little in Korea, it change d much in the U.S. The Truman administration profited handsomely from the war. It seized on the North Korean invasion in June 1950 to justify expanding t he military budget and the federal government itself. On September 8, 1950, Congress passed the Defense P roduction Act, giving the President authority over almost all economic resources in the country. 125 On December 15, Truman declared a national emergenc y — citing “the increasing menace of the forces of communist aggression.” This gave him dictatorial powers over   123 Th e F i rs t C a su a lt y b y P h il l ip Kn i gh t le y , p ag e 3 8 6. 124 Th e F i rs t C a su a lt y b y P h il l ip Kn i gh t le y , p ag e 3 8 6. 125 “ T he De f en s e P ro d uc ti o n A c t: by Le o n N .

Truman asked that everyone in America sacrifice for the common good. 126 The government assumed dictatorial powers to contro l what companies could produce and what consumers could buy. You had to get permis sion from the government to get a car loan or a mortgage. And, of course, the politic ians imposed wage and price controls. 127 Annual military spending had amounted to only $13.7 billion before the war, but it was up to $52.8 billion by the end of the war — and it never fell below $42 billion again. U.S. military production was seven fold from the st art of the Korean War to 1953. But only a small part of that production went to Korea. The rest was used to enhance overt and covert military operations in other parts of th e world. 128 The overall federal budget rose from $42.6 billion to $76.1 billion, and spending thereafter never fell below $68 billion. 129 HARRY S.

The public remembered the music critic Truman’s dau ghter, Margaret, was pursuing a career as a classical singer. On December 5, 1950, she gave a recital in Washington, D.C. which drew on unflattering review from The Washingt on Post’s music critic, Paul Hume. Truman sent Hume a letter on White House stationery , that said in part: I’ve just read your lousy review of Margaret’s conc ert. I’ve come to the conclusion that you are an “eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay.” . . . Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you’ ll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supp orter below! 131 No one had any illusions that he was an intellectua l, a straight-shooter, or a statesman. He retained his poor image for another twenty years or so. Rehabilitating Truman’s Image In the 1970s Plain Speaking novelist and journalist Merle Miller published a b ook of interviews with Truman. Miller’s hero-worship was e vident. He would ask Truman a series of leading questions — to which Truman could reply in the I-don’t-care-what-the- consequences-are-I-just-tell-the-truth fashion.   130 ht t p: / /w w w. q uo t at i on sp a g e. c om / qu o te s /H a rr y _S _T r u ma n /1 an d h t t p: / /w w w. t hi n ke x is t .c om / E ng l is h /A u th o r/ x /A u th or _ 3 04 4 _2 . ht m a n d h t t p: / /w w w. i nt e ll i ge n ts ia n e tw o rk . co m /t r um a n/ t ru ma n . ht m . 131 ht t p: / /w w w. r jg e ib . co m/ h e ro e s/ t ru m an / tr u ma n -d au g h te r .h t ml"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 95 For some reason, the liberal intelligentsia of the time swallowed this self-promotion. Miller’s book was on the New York Times best-seller list for months in 1973-1974, and was #1 for several months. Harry Truman was transfo rmed into one of America’s “near- great” Presidents. It wasn’t long before Republicans began lauding him as an example of a “good Democrat” (in contrast to whatever Democrats the Re publicans were criticizing at any given time). Truman’s Anti-Communism Central to the new view of Truman was that he had r ecognized and faced up to the Communist threat. It’s true that he authored foreig n policy that continued throughout the Cold War and beyond, but there is no evidence his p olicies were realistic or even that they were motivated by a genuine concern about comm unism. His anti-communism may have been no more than a pol itical ploy. It might even have been prompted by some slight that he may have felt at Stalin’s hands — since he never seemed to forget anything that rubbed him the wrong way. But it tells a lot about him that the fantasies he confided to his diary didn’t include generating a coup in Moscow or Beijing — or assassi nating Stalin or Mao. Instead he dreamed of wiping out every major Soviet and Chines e city — which would have killed tens of millions of people. 132 The Self-Promoter Truman was an intellectually challenged street-figh ter with a very short fuse who was thrust into the Presidency when many leading Democr ats wanted someone — anyone — to replace the extreme left-winger Henry Wallace as Franklin Roosevelt’s Vice-President in 1944.

He con fiscated the American steel industry, claiming the (divine?) right to seize any industry he wanted. He tried in peacetime to draft striking railroad wo rkers into the Army, created the military-industrial complex, and initiated the dest ructive foreign aid program.

We know these things because he told us so — over and over and over and over and over and over again. 133 CONCLUSION It was only after the Korean War was over — and, in some cases, only decades later — that Americans learned U.S. soldiers had fought and died not to defend a free country, but a tyranny as bad as the one America opposed — that the North Korean invasion was no surprise to American officials — that, far from bei ng determined to protect Korea from a Communist advance, the U.S. changed its attitude an d objectives in Korea several times — that American soldiers were unprepared, ill-train ed, and ill-equipped to fight in Korea — that Korea was devastated by the American militar y — that Truman had lied about the danger posed by the North Korean invasion — and tha t Harry Truman was prepared to use the Atomic Bomb in the war. By the time these truths surfaced, no one really ca red any more. They were too focused on another country — Vietnam — where Americans were supposedly fighting and dying to preserve “freedom and democracy.” COURT HISTORIANS On January 14, 1951, it became public knowledge tha t President Truman was in the process of setting up a group of court historians t o provide a proper history of world events that would not include the kind of events th at historians had revealed about the   133 An ex c el l en t s t ud y o f H a rr y T r um a n i s “ H a rr y S .

The cables claime d that the USS Maddox — which the North Vietnamese had attacked unsuccessfully with t orpedoes two days earlier — was again under torpedo attack, this time with up to tw enty-six torpedoes — more than the U.S. had estimated that North Vietnam possessed! Days later, at President Lyndon Johnson’s urging, C ongress passed — unanimously in the House and with only two dissenting votes in the Senate — the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, authorizing LBJ to “take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prev ent further aggression,” thus paving the way for escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. But what President Johnson didn’t tell Congress (an d the public) was that the Maddox’s captain had, later on August 4th, retracted his ear lier claims — the twenty-six “torpedoes” were apparently misread by his sonar op erator — although he insisted that the Maddox had been fired upon once that day. (When presented with a new analysis in 1981, however, the captain became convinced that th e Maddox had not been fired upon at all on August 4th.) And although the earlier, August 2nd, firing upon t he Maddox had occurred in international waters, this occurred as the Maddox w as fleeing what North Vietnam regarded as its territorial waters — eight miles fr om the mainland — a location from which the Maddox had been supporting U.S. covert mi ssions in North Vietnam. President Johnson and Defense Secretary Robert McNa mara — Ellsberg’s boss — publicly characterized the attack as a completely u nprovoked act of naked aggression that, if repeated, would be met with force. But in a secret meeting of the National Security Council that Ellsberg attended on August 4 th, then-CIA director John McCone"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 101 opined that the North Vietnamese were “reacting def ensively” to attacks on their off- shore islands. But the momentum for President Johnson’s military r esponse proved unstoppable. LBJ even insisted on announcing publicly that U.S. mili tary reprisals on North Vietnam were imminent — even before the U.S. response vessel had entered North Vietnam’s radar range, thus sacrificing the element of surprise to LBJ’s wish for quick publicity. From Maybury Book On August 4, 1964, President Johnson met with Congr essional leaders and told them of the attack. He said “some of our boys are floating around in the water.” Later determined to be false. A single machine gun bullet had struck the Maddox, making a half-inch hole and scratching the paint. 135 THE 1956 VIETNAMESE ELECTIONS From the Encarta Encyclopedia: The Geneva Accords called for reunifying elections to be held throughout Vietnam in 1956, a prospect the United States feare d since Ho Chi Minh was certain to win. With the support of the United States, Diem violated the accords by refusing to hold national elections. Ele ctions were staged only in the south and resulted in the establishment of the Republic of Vietnam (commonly referred to as South Vietnam) with Diem a s its first president. Also in violation of the Geneva Accords, U.S. milit ary advisers were brought in to create and train the Army of the Repu blic of Vietnam (ARVN). 136   135 “ T he Ph a nt o m B at t le t h a t L ed to Wa r ,” U .

We begin with the Gulf War because it may be the mo st blatant use of misrepresentation to conduct a war in the history of the world. The Gulf War was pretty much one long lie from begi nning to end. . . . • The politicians lied by omission — by not explainin g the historical context in which current events were occurring. • The politicians lied by inciting the American peopl e with fictitious claims of threats to America and Iraqi atrocities. • The politicians lied throughout the brief war by pr esenting a wholly false picture of what was actually happening in the war. • The politicians lied after the war by claiming that the American military had overcome a strong and dangerous foe. In effect, we civilians saw the Gulf War like a mov ie or a video game — a fictitious epic composed by script-writers. The story General Schwa rzkopf told on television of “smart bombs,” the amazing mid-air interception of Scud mi ssiles, and the laser-sharp accuracy of American air attacks was almost entirely fiction — bearing little resemblance to what actually happened in the war. After the war, it seemed important to the Bush admi nistration to portray the war as a great victory for the American military. General Sc hwarzkopf came home as a conquering hero who had slain the terrifying dragon s that threatened the world. When he spoke before a televised joint session of C ongress, it was as though the U.S. had just defeated the Soviet Union, China, Napoleon, an d Attila the Hun in one terrible war. The politicians jumped to their feet XX times to ch eer him. One of his biggest ovations came as he began the speech saying, “What a great d ay to be an American!” (because we beat up those frightened little people in the land of the tin-horn dictator)."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 104 Someone who spoke no English or German, and who loo ked at films of the Schwarzkopf speech and a torch-lit Nuremburg rally of the 1930s , would be hard-pressed to tell the difference. The cheering Congressmen looked no diff erent from (and had no more self- respect than) the Germans who proclaimed in unison “Deutschland uber alles!” I’m not comparing General Schwarzkopf with Adolf Hi tler. I am amazed to see the people holding some of the highest offices in the l and leaping to their feet and cheering as though they were school kids at a football game. But, then, perhaps we should be inured to this by n ow. After all, for decades Congressmen have been doing the same thing at the y early presidential State of the Union address. It’s just disconcerting to realize that pe ople who act like children are enacting the laws that govern your life. So what if these things turned out to be lies? Sadd am Hussein is still a very bad person. That may very well be true. But if so much of what we heard about Hussein turned out to be untrue, how do we know the rest of what we heard was true? I’m not suggesting Saddam Hussein is a good person. First off, he’s a politician, which lowers him in my eyes at the outset. Second, I’m su re he’s committed terrible acts. After all, look what our politicians can get away with — and we supposedly live in a democracy. Imagine what a dictator can accomplish a gainst his own people. But the fact remains that Iraq was absolutely no th reat to America. The politicians took us into war focusing exclusively on the sins of Saddam Hussein — real or unreal — while ignoring completely the very real sins of dictators who joined the “coalition” against Hussein and who received enormous amounts of money and gifts from the U.S. government — gifts that you paid for.

A Brief Legislative Review by Michael W. Gallagher mwglaw@msn.com Special to TLE"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 111 Prior to the destruction of the World Trade Center, the current administration, in the person of Attorney General John Ashcroft, tried to pass a number of repressive, and unconstitutional enactments as a part of the “war o n crime” and the “war on drugs”. They were generally given little chance of passage. However, Since September 11, 2001, there have been literally hundreds of bills submitted to either the House of Representatives, the Senate, or both, regarding “terrorism”. A recent review of statutes via the Library of Congre ss “Thomas” search engine, (http://thomas.loc.gov/) showed 576 proposed bills with the word “terrorism” alone filed with either house since September 11th. While some of these are unrelated, (i.e., a few seem, on very cursory review, to appear to refer to abortion, or other topics), most appear to be a part of the “war on terrorism”. So, after September 11th, Ashcroft and company join ed the fray, by merely re-captioning many of their proposals as “anti-terrorism” legisla tion. Possibly the greatest legislative obscenity fostered by the Ashcroft fascism factory to date, and sponsored by some of his legislative pet trolls, is the USA Patriot Act. Con gress, of course, enacted it reflexively. There are any number of dangerous, ridiculous, abus ive and/or clearly unconstitutional provisions in that law. The following is a partial list only. Sec.101: Counterterrorism fund. Establishes a slush fund wh ich need not be re-authorized from year to year. Sec.104: “Requests for technical assistance”. The military can be brought in for “technical assistance” by civilian agencies in nume rous cases, in contravention to the Posse Comitatus Act. Sec.105: Electronic snooping. The Secret Service shall deve lop a national network of “electronic crime task forces” for purpose of “prev enting, detecting, and investigating various forms of electronic crimes, including terro rism. (Translation: May develop more abilities to spy upon people, including American ci tizens, for any alleged crime. Not limited to investigations relating to espionage or terrorism). Sec.203: Sharing of information. Takes down post-Nixon prot ections against spreading around information, including tax information, to c riminal investigative agencies, at the determination of a government official that it, in some way, it might have something to do with foreign intelligence or counterintelligence . "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 112 Sec.215: Secret Warrants. Amends the Foreign Intelligence S urveillance Act (FISA), to allow it to get and serve secret search warrants to anybody, demanding information on anything, on the certification that, in the opinion of an FBI agent, it has something, anything, to do with “terrorism” or espionage. Yes, I said “secret”, and I said “everything”. That a search warrant must be signed by a judge is of little comfort. Any law enforcement organization worth 2 cents already has a list of ju dges who will sign anything. Further, just to make it even easier, FISA establis hed a special court and special judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, (and therefore even more predisposed to sign anything put in front of them). The hearings are “in camera”, (i.e, secret), “ex parte”, (i.e., the victim or his attor ney are never told about the proceeding, not permitted to attend even if they knew about it, and no public record of the proceeding is kept), and may consider “secret evidence” (which would probably include massive amounts of unreliable hearsay, but since it cannot be viewed, will never be questioned). So far, this provision has apparently been used at least three times, according to an editorial by liberal writer Nat Hentoff, in the Leg al Times, on such dangerous, anti- American organizations as libraries and/or book sto res. (The Hentoff article can be found at: http://www.law.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic+FTCo ntentServer?pagename= law/View&c=Article&cid=ZZZHRP0H4ZC&live=true&cst=1& pc=0&pa=0). Sec.223: Impediments to suing or prosecuting federal govern ment or officials. Under Sec.223, if you wish to sue the government for viol ating your rights, by way of any the above provisions, you are limited to a Bench (i.e., non-jury) trial. Despite the secrecy provisions, making it virtually impossible to find out if they have screwed you, you must bring an action within two years of the event, or w ithin two years of “. . . the date upon which the claimant first has a reasonable opportuni ty to discover the violation”, or you lose the right to sue. The act does not define what “reasonable opportunity” means. Next, the government can apply for a stay (i.e., a stopping) of the proceedings, for as long as a tame judge is willing to stay it. There are several provisions of the law, (so mealy- mouthed as to be laughable) that say the government can not use this against protected p olitical activity, (such as free speech). But, that was true long before this law was enacted . (A fact which has never stopped the FBI from doing want it wanted). However what is the penalty if someone targets you for your political beliefs and protected activities? No much. The following is too nauseating to describe, so I have merely reprinted the appropr iate provision below: "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 113 “Sec. 223(d) Administrative Discipline. — If a cour t or appropriate department or agency determines that the United States or any of its dep artments or agencies has violated any provision of this chapter, and the court or appropr iate department or agency finds that the circumstances surrounding the violation raise serio us questions about whether or not an officer or employee of the United States acted will fully or intentionally with respect to the violation, the department or agency shall, upon receipt of a true and correct copy of the decision and findings of the court or appropria te department or agency promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether discipli nary action against the officer or employee is warranted. If the head of the departmen t or agency involved determines that disciplinary action is not warranted, he or she sha ll notify the Inspector General with jurisdiction over the department or agency concerne d and shall provide the Inspector General with the reasons for such determination.” — Sec.223(c)(1) Of course, the way this usually works, if someone d oes demand a criminal prosecution of an agent or other person for violating someone’s ri ghts, (for example, murdering them), someone will offer up this little gem as an exclusi ve remedy against the agent. My guess is, they will probably get away with it, too. So, t hey can destroy your business, your home, incarcerate you, and even kill you, and all t hey get (at most) is a few days off without pay. Finally, this is the “exclusive remedy” for anyone damaged by government actions, taken pursuant, or purported to be taken pursuant, to thi s Act. As a part of their “war on terrorism” Reichsmarshal l Ashcroft and Co. have gone so far as to indict an attorney defending a Muslim clergym an, on the grounds that answering questions from the press constituted communicating terrorist information; (and virtually guaranteeing that the next hundred defendants, fore ign or domestic, accused to terrorism or other anti-government activities will be unable to secure competent defense counsel); demanded the “right” to bug all communications betw een (certain) defendants and their attorneys; broken into offices and searched them, w ith no notice, under “secret” warrants, (in clear violation of two hundred years of constit utional jurisprudence), and engaged in the sort of behavior that only a Lavrenti Beria or a Heinrich Himmler would consider a proper part of “law enforcement”. And this is just the beginning. It is the nature of things like this that they start slowly, against those people the public dislikes most, and grow over time, both in type and frequency of use, and in type of target, (i.e., vic tim). If it is allowed to stand, it is only a matter of time before it is read more and more broa dly, before the word “terrorism” is applied to more and more activities, and before mor e statutes like it are written, under the rubric of “national security”, with more secret war rants, “no-knock” searches, for more alleged “crimes”.

The Difference The President never explained that contradiction be tween the government’s impotence in Washington, D.C. and its power to rid the world of evil-doers. But I suspect if the President ever gave it a moment’s thought (even tho ugh I doubt that he did), he would have an answer for the contradiction, although I wo uldn’t expect him to acknowledge it openly. The difference in the mind of a politician is that he can use force openly, nakedly, unrestrictedly again foreigners in a way he can’t u se it in Washington, D.C. The President probably believes that using missiles , bombs, and 150,000 American soldiers he can achieve things overseas — while his approval rating might suffer a few points if he tried using those tools in Washington, D.C. or any other place within America. In one sense, it’s a politician’s dream: the abilit y to use all the force he wants without any expected repercussions from the American public. As it turned out, however, large segments of the po pulation did worry about all the foreigners being killed by our military. And the President was wrong about his ability to st amp out evil with force. As it turned out, probably every missile fired into Afghanistan and every civilian killed in Iraq produced a hundred more people willing to help the terrorists — to try to stop this all-powerful nation that was imposing its way upon the world. It was like Hercules fighting Thanatos.

Destroying the Oil Fields Rumors such as the possibility Iraq will destroy th eir oil fields has oil going through the roof. (from John Mauldin) The Assassination Attempt on Bush During 2001-2003, as George W. Bush moved from one rationale to another to support his desire to attack Iraq, one reason he cited was the presumed Iraqi attempt to assassinate Bush’s father, ex-President George H.W. Bush, in Sa udi Arabia in 1993. As we saw, World War I was ignited by two Serbs who assassinated Austrian Archduke Ferdinand in 1914. Instead of trying to capture and prosecute the assassins, the Austrians went to war, mutual-defense treaties were triggered , and all of Europe was plunged into a terrible conflict that eventually killed approximat ely 20 million people (8.5 million troops and 11.5 million civilians) and wounded 21 million. "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 122 No politician has the power of second sight — the a bility to see into the future and predict the outcome of his actions. This is usually cited as the excuse for such terrible tragedies as World War I — not to mention the ways that World War I made World War II inevitable. So Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph is never blamed for causing the deaths of 20 million people by attacking Serbia to revenge the death of his son. But the proper interpretation of the politicians’ i nability to see the future should be exactly the opposite. Because they can’t foresee the consequences of their aggre ssive acts, they should be very cautious about what they do. I realize that history is the last thing in the wor ld that interests George W. Bush. But someone should point out to him the human carnage a nd property wreckage that resulted from an attempt in 1914 to avenge an assassination. Politicians recite slogans, inciting people to want vengeance, thousands — or millions — of people die, none of the promised benefits of vic tory materialize, but the politicians are rarely blamed for the damage they’ve caused. Unless , of course, they’re on the losing side — in which case they can be made to take the b lame for every tragedy, every atrocity, every death — no matter which side was ac tually responsible.

She was given the best care possible under the difficult circumstances of all the Iraqi hospitals at the tim e. The hospital staff even tried to return her to the Americans. They drove her back in an ambulance, but were fired upon as they approached A merican lines. The ambulance returned to the hospital, where Jessica remained un der a doctor’s care until her “rescue.” On April 1, 2003, a unit of commandos burst into th e unguarded hospital, broke down doors, and tied up the doctors and other staff pers onnel. They carried Jessica out and back to the American camp. A TV unit accompanied the com mandos — filming the entire episode, so that the folks back home could see the rescue for themselves.

While Europe’s young men spent most of their time f ighting in wars of aggression or wars of defense, America’s young men were exploring the West, developing new companies, new products, and new services. We read of wars, battles, strategic triumphs, allia nces, tactical maneuvers, and heroism. But war is nothing but devastation — the devastatio n of property and the devastation of human life. During the Napoleonic wars of the early 1800s, tens of thousands of men would die month after month, year after year. And for what? F or conquests that fed the glory and egos of rulers — conquests that were reversed the f ollowing year or decade. It’s no wonder that America progressed so much more rapidly than Europe during the 1800s. As a result, by the end of the century, our young nation was a world-class country. It’s entry into World War I not only tipped the bal ance of power, it upended it. The devastation suffered by European countries in W orld War I and World War II only heightened the lead the U.S. had over European coun tries, it didn’t create that lead. Although Americans fought in both those wars, they didn’t enter the war until after a great deal of the damage had occurred, and they nev er had to fight the wars on their own land.

Yes, it is a tragedy to live in those countries and be part of those never-ending fears and hatreds. But what is even more tragic is that America — bou nd by two giant oceans and two friendly neighbors, blessed with a clean slate and no long-standing enemies — deliberately, unnecessarily, and to no successful e nd injects itself into the feuds of other countries and allows itself to become the object of hate and fear. Objectives Every American war of the 20th century has been acc ompanied by a high-minded objective: • World War I was the war to end all wars. • World War II was going to establish an internationa l organization that would keep the peace throughout the world. • The Korean War was going to reunify the Korean peni nsula. • The Vietnam War was going to stop the communists in their tracks. • The Gulf War was going to establish a New World Ord er. At the time I wrote this, the latest war was the on e in Iraq — which President Bush claimed would bring freedom to the Iraqis and peace to the Middle East.

"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 153 Introduction When I was growing up, we thought of America as bei ng a country like no other in the world. Fastened in our minds were several elements of that uniqueness: • America didn’t start wars; it finished and won the wars started by others. • America was a much more humane country than others. Even in war, it didn’t stoop to the brutality and barbarism engaged in by other nations. • America was the land of the free. Individual libert y was the highest political value. When someone was criticized for hi s actions, it was common to retort, “It’s a free country, isn’t it?” Whenever we fought, we were fighting to defend precious freedoms that were n’t available in any other country. Impressions Linger on Because the Constitution was so honored in practice as well as word during the first hundred years, and because America stayed out of fo reign wars during that period, the notion of America’s uniqueness has persisted. We still think there’s something special about Amer ica: • “America is a free country.” • “We have liberties people in no other countries hav e.” • “America would never fight a war of conquest, like other nations do.” • “If America is in a war, we must be in the right an d the other side wrong.” These impressions of America have lingered long aft er the realities have disappeared. Yes, we still have some freedoms that some people i n some other countries don’t have, but the liberties we have left are far from unique. And American politicians now have the power to take us into wars for any purpose they cho ose — even without Congress taking the time to deliberate and investigate whether the provocation is what it seems to be. "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 154 And the politicians have the power to censor war co rrespondents, so that the war is reported in whatever way is helpful to the politici ans, even if it isn’t helpful to America. Reality Check If we want to preserve and expand the liberties we have left, we have to drop the scales from our eyes and view politicians, power, and wars as they really are. • We have to realize that whatever power is given to politicians, they will use. And if you give the power to a good politician to do good, you have automatically given some future bad politician the power to do bad. You can’t specify that a given power will be used only for a good purpose. • We have to realize as well that not all bad politic ians started out determined to expand their own power and fortunes a t our expense. Many of them had high ideals and objectives but eve ntually succumbed to the temptation to take care of themselves, simpl y because they were given the power to do so. • And we have to realize that not only does power cor rupt, but that power attracts the worst elements of society. Those with the most benevolent instincts generally don’t gravitate to positions wh ere they can inflict their way on other people by force. If you give power to a good person, you’re creating a magnet that will attract people who see that power as a way to get what they want for themselves without regard to the consequences inflicted on other people. In other words, the problem is not so much the peop le involved, but the power that’s been handed to them. As Michael Cloud has pointed out, “ The problem isn’t the abuse of power; it’s the power to abuse.” Nowhere is this more evident than with matters of w ar and peace. The power to wage war has elevated more than one otherwise mediocre Presi dent into a G LORIOUS L EADER OF THE F REE W ORLD — remembered by grateful citizens as the man who sa ved us from ___________ [fill in the blank].

Her situation is remote from all the wrangling world, and she has no thing to do but to trade with them. 161 And in 1899, William Graham Sumner, explaining the Founding Fathers’ idea of America, said: There was to be no grand diplomacy, because they in tended to mind their own business and not be involved in any of the intr igues to which European statesmen were accustomed. There was to be no balan ce of power and no “reason of state” to cost the life and happiness of citizens. 162 In short, America was blessed by being insulated fr om the perpetual fighting of the Old World — insulated by two gigantic oceans and two fr iendly neighbors. The American ideal considered individual liberty to be far more important than “national greatness” or great social experiments. Yes, it is a different world now than it was a cent ury or two ago. But with regard to America’s safety, most of the difference for us has been caused by our politicians — not by the never-ending string of Old World tyrants. Americans need to know that it doesn’t have to be t his way . We don’t have to live in a garrison state, accepting every claim of a new thre at as our sad fate. We don’t have to give up the Bill of Rights for an alleged security that never s eems to materialize.

I don’t agree with them, but it’s an honest opinion. But that, too, is irrelevant. Whether right or wrong, the politicians lie about t he reasons for going to war, they lie about the conduct of the war, they lie about what t he postwar world will be like, and they perpetuate those lies long after the war has ended. The obvious lesson from the evidence, an enormous a mount of which will be presented in this book, is very simple: You should disregard whatever the politicians say u ntil they provide absolute proof of their assertions. • When your President or Senator Foghorn goes on and on about the terrible things a foreign leader is doing to his own people or his ne ighbors, take it with a grain of salt.

Before Congress can vote on a war declaration, the President must appear in person before Congress to present the case for war and answer all questions posed by members of Congress. 3. In the absence of a Congressional declaration of wa r, the President may deploy the military to repel an armed invasion of t he United States, but may not deploy troops or engage in hostilities outs ide the United States. 4. The United States shall enter into no treaty with a ny nation or organization if such treaty could oblige the United States to be at war without a declaration of war by Congress, and the U nited States shall not be bound to engage in war by any action taken by an y organization of which they are a member. 5. Except in time of war, as specified in Section 1, t he United States will provide no weapons or any other resources to foreig n governments, will engage in no military action outside the borders of the United States, and shall deploy no military personnel or weapons outsi de the boundaries of the United States — except that elements of the Nav y may venture up to 300 miles outside the United States and a contingen t of no more than 25 military personnel is permissible at each embassy. 6. Conscription is strictly prohibited in wartime or p eacetime as a violation of the 13th amendment against slavery. 7. In the absence of a declaration of war, no one may be treated as a prisoner of war, and anyone detained by the United States or any subdivision is entitled to full constitutional prot ection. 8. Upon any violation of this article by the President , Congress has the obligation (not the option) to institute impeachment proceedi ngs within 14 days. Neither section 2 nor section 4 precludes a missile defense or any other kind of defense of this nation. It says only that the President must w ait until a declaration of war has been issued before attacking a foreign nation or sending troops abroad. Even if some incapacity prevents Congress from making a declarat ion quickly, America could still defend itself. It just couldn't attack anyone else.

And it’s doubtful that a single one of those roughl y 5,000 American lives lost in attacks on the U.S. would have been lost if Presidents had been restrained from playing God. LACK OF SUCCESS IN FIGHTING WARS EDUCATION We can fault the schools for the lack of knowledge that Americans have about wars.

It is your br others and sisters being taught to kill other people ~ and to hate people who are just like themselves and who don’t want to kill anyone either.

It is the suppression of free speech and the jailing of people who criticize the government. It is the imposition of slavery by forcing young me n to serve in the military.

Government’s Role If government has a role to play in foreign affairs , it isn’t to win wars, to assure that the right people run foreign countries, to protect inno cent foreigners from guilty aggressors, or to make the world safe for democracy ~ or even a safer place at all. If government has a role, it can be only to keep us out of wars ~ to make sure no one will ever attack us, to make certain you can live your l ife in peace, to assure you the freedom to ignore who is right and who is wrong in foreign conflicts.

The millions of automobiles produced every year in America don’t involve the forcible conscription of labor. No people die as the inevita ble “collateral damage” that must accompany the greater mission of getting the automo biles out the door. In fact, companies pride themselves on their safety records. When a company’s computers create problems, the com pany’s management doesn’t reach for its guns and start threatening people in order to solve the problems. When a company faces a problem with a foreign gover nment, it finds a way to get around the problem. It doesn’t declare war on the foreign government. When a business problem arises, it may be that no o ne involved knows the solution at the outset. But that doesn’t mean the management must r each for their guns and start shooting or threatening. Instead, they hire the mos t creative minds to come up with solutions. Force is not an option — and yet most business prob lems get solved. But when politicians face a diplomatic problem, the re is no other answer but force. Guns must be used, resources and people must be confisca ted, people must die.   163 Wh y G o ve r nm e nt Do e sn’ t W o rk by Ha r ry Br o wn e."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 162 No time is spent looking for some peaceful way of s ettling the problem.

And every war is sold as the means to bring about a permanent peace — when in fact the war makes future wars inevitable. As we’ve seen, the United States had no reason to e nter World War I — a purely European squabble. But Woodrow Wilson misled the Am erican people and caused America to be involved. U.S. entry in the war tippe d the balance of power, allowed a punitive and humiliating peace to be imposed on the Germans, and thus created the conditions that led to World War II. Again, World War II was no business of America. But Franklin Roosevelt misled the American people in order to get America involved. T he U.S. government transferred enormous resources to the Soviet Union, allowing th e Soviets to take over eastern Europe and become a 45-year threat to the United States. America fought the Cold War partly in the open and greatly in secret. U.S. Presidents misled the American people by hiding the events in which U.S. resources were used to overthrow governments — some of them democratic gov ernments — and help keep brutal dictators in power. These events provoked a worldwide revulsion against the United States — allowing terrorists to gain the sup port of people who saw no other way to strike back against the American giant. Now the so-called War on Terrorism is being fought in the same way. U.S. planes, missiles, and soldiers are killing thousands of inn ocent people, occupying foreign countries, and our government is demanding absolute obedience from every other country in the world.

(Sarajevo in World War I and 9/11 with Afghanistan and Iraq.) IS WAR NECESSARY? I have managed to live on this planet for 70 years without ever striking another human being. There have been a dozen or so times when someone wa nted to fight me. I managed to talk my way out of a fight in most of those cases. In the few times I didn't succeed in avoiding a fight altogether, I managed to end the s cuffle without hitting the other person and without suffering any noticeable damage to myse lf. Granted, I've been fortunate. I grew up in a peacef ul suburban area. Had I had the bad fortune to have been born in the inner city in a ga ng neighborhood, I might not have avoided violence so easily. But that's an important point. Being fortunate in t he circumstances of my birth and my growing-up, I didn't squander that good fortune by looking for trouble. The U.S. by Birth America was also fortunate in the circumstances of its birth. After one apparently necessary fight to extricate i tself from British rule, it found itself in the best neighborhood possible. It is bounded by tw o friendly countries and two enormous oceans. No need here to look for trouble. And yet, ruled by American instead of British polit icians, the United States has found itself embroiled in one street fight after another. In fact, in the 20th century there were less than 2 0 years in which America was at peace with the world. What with World Wars, the Cold War, police actions, gunboat diplomacy in Latin America, overthrowing governments in Iran and other places, suppressing the Philippine rebellion, interfering with the Mexican revolution, firing missiles at Afghanistan and the Sudan, invading Panama and Gren ada, bombing Libya, and on and on and on, Americans have lived with the tension of conflict and violence almost their entire lives."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 166 And we live in a good neighborhood! The Swiss by Birth Contrast our circumstances with those of Switzerlan d. The poor Swiss have the misfortune of living in the middle of one of the worst neighborhoods in the world. Centuries of imperial r ivalries, ethnic hatreds, governments armed to the teeth and ready to go to war at the dr op of the hat, and populations nursing grudges against each other — all these elements hav e kept Europe in turmoil for centuries. Switzerland is like the inner-city family that hear s gunfire outside its windows every night. And yet Switzerland hasn't been involved in a singl e war for two centuries. The Swiss managed to avoid being sucked into the World Wars, the Cold War, or any of the other conflicts that have beset Europe. The Swiss haven't been fortunate in their geographi cal circumstances. But they've dealt with those circumstances intelligently. It wasn't b y the grace of dictators that they've avoided war; it has been a national policy to do so . The Swiss have always made sure it was in the self- interest of warring nations to leave Switzerland out of their quarrels. They've devised ingenious defenses to demonstrate that, while Switzerland is not unconquerable, the cost of conquest would be intolerable to the conqueror. And they've made themselves an indispens able trading partner to any country that otherwise might see some profit in invading Sw itzerland. It may seem that war is inevitable for many countries — such a s the warring factions in the Balkans or some countries in Asia or Africa. Bu t Switzerland has proven that it isn't inevitable for anyone — not even for a country as p oorly situated as Switzerland is. Why then is America continually at war over one thi ng or another?

And the diplomacy was bound to fail, because it involved our politici ans making insensitive demands on a foreign country — demands we had no authority to ma ke, demands that were known in advance to be unacceptable to the foreigners. In the few cases that America has been attacked, it 's been because our politicians were trying to dictate to other countries — countries th at represented no threat to us at all. The foreigners attacked either to try to gain an advant age against the stronger U.S. when our government had made war seem inevitable (as at Pear l Harbor), or because attacking seemed the only way to strike back at a country tha t was throwing its weight around in other people's business (as in 9/11).

Switzerland has not had a war in lots of years because every Swiss is armed, is in the armed services until age 40, and shoots to kill anyone that violates their sovereign ty. They are at all times prepared to defend themselves . And, being such a small country, even Hitler and Stalin and his successors felt that the cost of invasion was not worth the gain. Wake up, smell the coffee and live in the real worl d, not some idealistic place in your warped mind and some place that has never exis ted.” ANSWER: Since I said in my article \"They've devised ingeni ous defenses to demonstrate that, while Switzerland is not unconque rable, the cost of conquest would be intolerable to the conqueror,\" I'm not sure what yo u're complaining about.

When Germany lo st the war, Switzerland simply kept the gold and other valuable items and founded a banking system that would not have been possible otherwise.

The reason they never go to war is because  that is the enclave that the world's bankers use to house all the world's  (their) money. And, they are the ones that fund all the wars, and both sides  of the wars. War is very pro fitable for them and keeps countries unstable,  while they remain in full ch arge through finances which is power.” ANSWER: I understand what you're saying, but Switzerland doesn't fund wars. The  Swiss government foreign aid program is too small to have any effect on  anything. And the banks are privately owned. No private bank is going to  lend money to both sides of a war (as our government sometimes has),  because a bank can't afford to lend money to the loser who may not repay  his loans.

As for the other question, the Roosevelt administra tion browbeat the Japanese for two years before Pearl Harbor — demand ing that the Japanese give up their colonies and conquests in China and E ast Asia.

The mere fact that the war doesn’t end is a signal to politicians that tougher methods are needed. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ALWAYS EXPAND There is a pattern in government programs: they alw ays expand beyond the original harmless, moderate estimates of what they will enta il. The politicians tell us there’s a problem — too muc h illicit drug use, poor reading skills in schools, too many people in poverty, terrorists are a dangerous threat, some people not getting sufficient health care, or something else. A program is proposed. Promises are made that this program will solve the problem within a year or two. But the program doesn’t solve the problem. So the p rogram must be made more forceful. In areas such as education or health care, the answ er is to spend more money. When that doesn’t work, spend even more money — and more and more and more. For example, 40 years after the federal government first stuck its nose into education, after spending hundreds of billions of dollars to i mprove government schools, 166 after dictating standards to local school districts, the politicians tell us the schools are a mess and the only solution is to spend still more taxpay er dollars.   166 Se e t h e f ed e ra l g o ve rn m e nt ’ s “ N o C hi l d L ef t B e hi n d” w e bs i te at : h t t p: / /w w w. e d. g ov / nc l b/ ov e r vi e w/ i mp o rt a nc e /e d li te - i nd e x. h tm l"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 174 In areas such as drug use or terrorism, the escalat ion is of a different kind. When the problem isn’t solved, it’s true more money is spent . But the real expansion takes place at the cost of civil liberties. • Law-enforcement people become liars, posing as drug dealers or terrorists, in order to entrap people. • Asset forfeiture laws are used to confiscate proper ty and help finance law enforcement. • It becomes much easier to get warrants to invade yo ur privacy. • The success of the program is measured by the numbe r of prosecutions and convictions, not by whether drug use or terrori sm is declining. • in exchange for leniency, confessed felons are enti ced to testify against people who may or may not be guilty. • Citizens are held without bail, without access to a n attorney, without a speedy trial. In short, the Bill of Rights is eventually discarde d. And the notion that these invasions of liberty apply only to drug dealers or terrorists is a naïve one. Without due process of law, a fair trial, and confronting the defendant’s accus ers, it’s impossible to know whether someone is a drug dealer or a terrorist. And when success is measured by convictions, don’t expect everyone in law enforcement to be as meticulous as you are about prosecuting on ly guilty people. When George W.

Or that teachers’ unions push for increased spending on schools. Or that trade organizations push to kee p competition out of their markets through licensing or tariffs. Why should we be surprised that war is appealing to arms-makers, airplane builders, or missile manufacturers?

More uniforms are needed — pl us mess trays, jeeps, tanks, {make this a long list}. Do the people in all these businesses say to themse lves, “It’s worth having a lot of people die so that I can make more money”? I doubt it. But, then, do farmers say to themselves, “It’s wort h it that some families will have to go without in order for me to make more money”? Again, I doubt it. Instead, politicians are experts at transforming se lf-interest into the national interest. They don’t promote farm subsidies by saying they wa nt to make the owners of big agri- businesses richer yet. They say the nation’s securi ty depends on having a self-sustaining domestic food supply. They don’t promote aid to education on the grounds that the heads of teachers’ unions should have more power. They decry the terrible sho rtage of teachers and classrooms that supposedly are the cause of our children getting su ch poor educations. Munitions makers simply point out the need for a bi gger defense budget — or even to attack some other country — in order to make our co untry safer. Politicians But the most important cause of war is the politici ans. Without them, no one’s cause would succeed. Politicians make informal alliances with farm group s, teachers’ unions, arms makers, and corporations of all kinds in order to expand their own power and to get allies for their own reelections. Such alliances are as old as government itself. Eve n kings established alliances with bankers, businessmen, or organizations in order to govern more easily. That’s why the America’s Founding Fathers were so d etermined to provide a Constitution that severely limited the federal government to a f ew simple functions — and to limit the ability of the chief executive to roam the world lo oking for trouble.

Th e Indians had no archives, no written documents, or other evidence to refute what America n politicians may have said. There were some claims of Indian atrocities that we re fictitious. But they’re already common knowledge, and I don’t want to take up space in this book reiterating what is commonly known. The second reason is that the Indian Wars probably involved fewer lies than most U.S. wars. The wars were wars of conquest by the America n government and no one pretended they were anything else. There were no cries that the Indians were planning to conquer America — and then the world. There were no claims of secret plots by Indi ans to assassinate American Presidents. The wars were rationalized by saying that America h ad a “manifest destiny” to rule the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific — and so the Indians had to be subdued. Whether or not that was a proper attitude is debata ble, but at least very few people — especially those in power in the U.S. government — pretended otherwise.

In the first place, the American government was in no danger of perishing. Despite the lies circulated in the North during the war, th e South had no designs on conquering the North. Quite the contrary, they were trying to escape from Northern domination in order to set up their own government.

Terrorism “If Lincoln had lived, he would have imposed a merc iful peace on the South, and Reconstruction wouldn’t have been so brutal.” The idea that Lincoln was basically a peaceful man is belied by the tactics he condoned during the war. One of the worst outgrowths of the Civil War was th e acceptance of terrorism as a wartime strategy. The common definition of terrorism (when anyone bot hers to define the term) is the killing and intimidation of innocent civilians in o rder to influence a government to change its policies. 3   3 Terrorism is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations as “...the unlawful use of force and violence again st persons or property to intimidate or coerce a gover nment, the civilian population, or any segment ther eof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85) The FBI further describes terrorism as either domes tic or international, depending on the origin, base , and objectives of the terrorist organization. For the p urpose of this report, the FBI uses the following d efinitions of terrorism: l Domestic terrorism refers to activities that involv e acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any state; appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a ci vilian population; to influence the policy of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. [18 U.S.C. § 2331(5)] • International terrorism involves violent acts or ac ts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any state, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or any state. These acts appear to be intended to intimid ate or coerce a civilian population; influence the poli cy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruct ion, assassination or kidnapping and occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of t he United States or transcend national boundaries i n terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators o perate or seek asylum. [18 U.S.C. § 2331(1)] THE FBI DIVIDES TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITY INTO TWO CATEGO RIES: • A terrorist incident is a violent act or an act dangerous to human life, in violation of the criminal laws of the United States, or of any state, to intimidat e or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives. • A terrorism prevention is a documented instance in which a violent act by a known or suspected terrorist group or individual with the means and a proven propensity for violence is successfully interdicted through investigative activity."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 193 Prior to the American Civil War, civilians were con sidered completely off-limits to the military. War was between soldiers and sailors; non-combatants were not to be touched. In fact, one of the first big battles of the Civil War was Bull Run on July 21, 1861. As the armies of the North and South got ready to fight, c ivilians poured into the area and camped on the hillside to watch the battle. They kn ew that, no matter who won the battle, the victors would not attack the civilians. It also was understood that armies didn’t confiscat e the property of civilians, that they negotiated to buy the supplies they needed whe n invading enemy territory. War was between combatants and civilians weren’t to be dist urbed. All that changed with the Civil War. Sherman’s famo us march through Georgia was the hallmark of the new kind of war. He burned the houses of civilians, slaughtered their livestock, stole their property, and even burned do wn entire cities — to intimidate the people, hoping they would prevail on the Southern g overnment to surrender. General Grant did the same thing in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. And Lincoln was all in favor of these tactics. He c ommended them for their “victories.” {See if there’s a quote available.} Eventually, the Southerners retaliated in kind. War had been transformed from what had been considered an honorable (if misguided) end eavor into animal savagery. To think that Lincoln could condone this, but would have been merciful in the war’s aftermath is naïve. After having imposed his way th rough brute force throughout the war, do you think he would condone any deviation from hi s post-war desires without continuing to use brute force to enforce his way? T hat doesn’t seem plausible. Today, terrorism comes in many forms, but it is sti ll the killing and intimidation of innocent people in order to force a government to c hange its policies. We see that terrorism in Middle-East suicide bombers, in Cheche n rebels holding Russian civilians hostage in a Moscow theater, in American bombing of innocent Iraqis, and in countless other forms. Acts have consequences. The terrorist acts in the C ivil War have led eventually to terrorist acts all over the world (with politicians selectively condemning those that aren’t to their advantage).

The War Necessary? “If the Civil War hadn’t been fought, we would stil l have slavery.” {Show a table of the countries that ended slavery p eacefully. A footnote can mention the slave revolt in Haiti — which was a revolution, not a war.} Slavery is an unmitigated evil. But it was just as evil in the XX other countries that ended slavery during the 19th century without killi ng people to make it happen. In the mid-1800s, the U.S. — apart from slavery — comprise d one of the freest countries in the world. So why did America need a bloody slaughter, killing 600,000 people, in order to end slavery — when no other country required such s avagery to do so? No one can know for certain what would have happene d if Abraham Lincoln had allowed the South to secede in peace. Other than kn owing that 600,000 people wouldn’t have died, we can only speculate on an alternative history. But it does seem logical to suppose that: • The North and South would have coexisted, and proba bly established a free-trade zone — with people and products passing back and forth between the two countries without tariffs, passport s, or other interference. • Slavery would have died out eventually. Only a smal l minority of Southerners held slaves and they became a greater a nd greater embarrassment to Southerners as other countries fou nd ways to end slavery peacefully. Most likely, the Confederate go vernment would have reimbursed slave-owners for freeing their slaves. W hen might this have happened? Probably sometime before the end of the 1 9th century. • By the time slavery ended, there probably would hav e been agitation to reunite the North and South as one country again. T o make that happen, the North would have had to agree to forgo protecti ve tariffs and corporate welfare — a change that would continue to be a blessing today. • If the reunion didn’t occur, the two countries woul d have continued to live in peace — just as Canada and the U.S. have do ne. In the 19th century, many Americans believed it was necessary f or America to conquer Canada and make it a part of the United Sta tes of America; it never happened, but that hasn’t prevented the two c ountries from enjoying each other’s company.

I abhor the slavery that still exists in some parts of the world — such as the Sudan. I abhor the conscription of young men to be slaves of the government during peacetime or wartime. I abhor the imprisoning without trial of people — i n America or elsewhere. I abhor any kind of slavery. Most Americans would agree with me on these points — especially about Negro slavery in America. But public opinion wasn’t always that way. In the 1 800s, despite the fact that only a very small minority of Americans owned slaves, most Americans — North and South — accepted slavery as a fact of life. After all, slav ery had existed for thousands of years. Labor wasn’t the same then as it is now. Farming an d manufacturing were tedious, slow processes. There were no motorized plows, no c otton gins, no assembly lines, no machine tools, no computers. Almost everything reli ed on brute strength and human exertion. As a result, everything was costly in terms of huma n effort and it took far more hours of work than it does today to earn the money to buy something. One way around some of these costs was the use of h uman slavery, by which people could be forced to work for little more than room a nd board. Some Americans wouldn’t engage in slavery for moral reasons. Some wouldn’t do so because the particular community in which they lived frowned on it. Many w ouldn’t do so because they didn’t have the capital to purchase slaves. But very few p eople opposed the general institution.

During that century, XX countries did away with any form of slavery. That in itself was good news. But even better news was the fact that slavery was being abolished peacefully .

Outside the United States, Haiti was the only count ry to experience violence in doing away with slavery. And the violence there involved a slave rebellion that overthrew the existing regime system. Getting rid of slavery in the United States was not an easy task. But it was obvious that the end of slavery was coming. The use of stea m energy was transforming manufacturing, and the introduction of the cotton g in was making labor on Southern plantations much more productive. Because of these innovations, the labor cost per unit of product was declining — making slave labor seem much less a necessity. There were problems, however. Northern politicians didn’t want slavery extended to new territories, because they didn’t want ex-slaves undercutting the labor markets there. But they also didn’t want to see all the slaves fre ed, allowing them to pour into Northern states and offering their services to undersell Nor thern laborers. Jim Crow Laws There also was the problem that strong prejudices e xisted against Negroes both in the North and South. Throughout the North there were la ws as onerous as the infamous “Jim Crow” laws the Southern states had in the 1950s. For example, in Abraham Lincoln’s Illinois, XXXX. [ other examples] Alternative History No one can say for certain how slavery would have e nded if there hadn’t been a Civil War. But it seems almost certain that slavery would have ended anyway — and most likely before the end of the 1800s. I realize that to any individual slave, another 20- 40 years of slavery is too much to bear. And I wish slavery had ended peacefully in 18 60 — or even centuries before that. But I also wish that slavery had ended without caus ing the deaths of over 600,000 Americans in the process. It is one thing to want to free the slaves. It is a nother to want to free them at the cost of the lives of hundreds of thousands of non-slave- owning people — including women, children, and other civilians.

This chapter is solely on the myths of war itself t hat are specific to any war. The Myths War is last resort. Efficient fighting force. (soldiers not firing guns ) Politicians want peace. War Is First Resort When the incident occurs, the politicians immediate ly respond with the assumption that \"We have no choice but to go to war.\" No attempt is made to understand what provoked the incident — or even to determine exactly what ha ppened — let alone to find a peaceable solution. Instead, the U.S. is at war. BILL OF RIGHTS DOESN’T APPLY TO FOREIGNERS Why are the Bill of Rights, open trials, the rule o f law, and the traditional American rules of evidence important? Two reasons: If an innocent person is convicted and punished, it ’s an injustice to that person — and the Founding Fathers were determined that Ame ricans wouldn’t suffer the injustices that had oppressed so many innocent people in the Old World. If an innocent person is convicted, the real crimin al will be free to commit more crimes. So it misses the point to say the civil liberties o f individuals must be balanced against the safety of the community. If individual civil libert ies aren’t protected, the safety of the community is endangered by putting the wrong people in prison — allowing the guilty to continue to function. It’s vital that only the guilty be convicted — whet her the accused is suspected of a petty theft, a terrorist act, or mass murder."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 201 It’s vital that only the guilty be convicted — whet her the accused is an American citizen, a green-card resident, or an outright foreigner. Whatever the crime, whoever the accused, your safet y requires that only the guilty be convicted. Each Rule Is Important The Bill of Rights and the rules of evidence were d eveloped to assure that only the truly guilty are convicted. The right to a trial by jury: A defendant must be tried by \"a jury of his peers\" so that he isn’t judged by people who can gain personally by c onvicting him. The right to a public trial: If the prosecutors, judges, and juries can’t be se en and judged by the public, they can short-circuit a fair trial. The right to counsel: A defendant isn’t likely to have the talent and sk ills necessary to call the jury’s attention to logical gaps in the pr osecution’s case. So the defendant must have a skilled lawyer. To assure that the right per son was convicted, appellate courts have ordered retrials when the accused didn’t have compe tent counsel. The right to confront one’s accusers: No evidence is valid if the person offering it can ’t be cross-examined by the defense. Hearsay evidence is worthless because you can’t be sure what someone meant by what he said if you can’ t question him. The right to remain silent: If you’re nervous or inarticulate, a skilled polic eman or prosecutor could cause you to say something that’s incriminating but not literally true. The right to private consultation with an attorney: To mount a competent defense, a defendant must be able to speak freely to his attor ney — confident that his words won’t be taken out of context or otherwise misinterpreted . These are just some of the rules that are vital to assure that the innocent aren’t convicted while the truly guilty go free. If these rules are discarded — as the Bush administ ration proposes to do with secret military trials — we have no guarantee that the peo ple convicted, and possibly executed, will be the true villains. And if the wrong people are convicted, the guilty ones can continue terrorizing Americans."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 202 And those who say \"terrorists have forfeited their rights\" are forgetting the most important point: Without a fair, open trial, you ca n’t be sure the accused person really is a terrorist. Allowing government employees to acts as investigators, prosecutors, judges, and juries isn’t the same as conducting a fair, ope n trial. Why the Bill of Rights Is Ignored The Bill of Rights, the rule of law, and the rules of evidence are there to protect both individuals and society. If the individual isn’t sa fe from false prosecution, society isn’t safe from criminals. Saying the terrorist danger justifies tearing up th e Bill of Rights makes as much sense as saying a threat of invasion justifies disbanding th e military. It’s a shame that schools don’t show children why t he Bill of Rights is so important. But then, why would government want to teach childr en that its important to protect individuals from government? CONSEQUENCES The lies allow various consequences to occur. Among them . . .

Instead, the U.S. is at war. Trivialization of Human Life Dead people become transformed from human tragedies into simple statistics. When a plane crash or train wreck causes 50 people to die, it an important news story for days afterward. When 150 soldiers die in a single b attle, it’s just a statistic — a necessary \"cost\" in the war for Good against Evil. The 150 battlefield deaths may even be considered a triumph if they’re accompanied by a much larger death toll for the enemy. And needless to say, no one much cares how many peo ple in the enemy nation die. In fact, the more, the better. A bombing raid that kil ls thousands of civilians is considered a success."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 203 Non-War Legislation & Power Increased The politicians immediately pass legislation and as sume powers that don’t help prosecute the war, but that they’ve wanted all along and were n’t able to pass in peacetime. Rapid Growth of Government The government is expanded at an unprecedented rate . After the war, there usually is a retrenchment, but spending, taxing, regulations, an d power never go back to their previous level. Historical Record of the War Changes The generally accepted interpretations of the cause s and conduct of the war change some time after the war is ended. Sometimes the revision s reveal truths that weren’t known by the general public during the war; sometimes the re visions fashion legends quite contrary to what actually happened.

Brute Force & World War II \"Sometimes only brute force will work.\" Did brute force work for the Nazis and Japanese? Political Leaders Running the War The assumption that the war is being run efficientl y. Lincoln, Roosevelt, Johnson Bush spent all his time fund-raising or giving chee r-leading speeches. The Common Elements of War Lay out at the start the common elements of each wa r. Refer back to them in the recap of each war. (1) Reasons for the war change often (ind icating that the real reason may be something never raised); (2) Heavy propaganda that is found to be untrue after the war; (3) Criticism of the all-powerful leader is conside red close to treason; (4) Contradictions occur (the things supposedly being fought against a re imposed at home); (5) The aims of the war aren’t met; (6) New government programs are initiated that aren’t abolished after the war. One War Leads to Another The Treaty of Versailles made World War II almost i nevitable — by creating the terrible conditions that encouraged the German people to go along with Hitler. How often have we heard that \"Hitler should have been stopped at M unich.\" Whether that was possible at that point in history is debatable. But what is alm ost certain is that Hitler could have been stopped at Versailles. Commercial Imperialism The traditional leftist view is that America fought foreign wars to promote commercial interests (as in Central America and to provide a b ase in the Philippines for the Navy to protect commercial shipping). This leads too easily to the idea that American companies in foreign countries are bad. They aren’t."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 205 If American companies go into a country without the backing of the U.S. military, they will have to abide by local laws and make their pea ce with local customs. Tie this with protecting oil supplies, etc. Duty to Rescue Others Do Americans have a duty to rescue people in other countries from invaders or oppressive dictators? Should be voluntary. The Costs of War The death toll, war by war. The residual losses of liberty — such as the Tradin g with the Enemy Act from World War I. Ignorance of Foreign Policy Why the events of September 11 shouldn’t have been a surprise. How ignorance has made it easy for Americans to be lured into previou s wars. Miscellaneous Lies Dishonest reasons for American military interventio n: Defending human rights, protecting American interests, keeping the oil flowing, stopping the next \"Hitler,\" taking a moral stand, and so on.

"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 206 War Is Good for the Economy Cover this one.    E SELLING WAR "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 207 Every war comes with a package of propaganda campai gns — basic themes that are used to get Americans to support the war: 1. Good vs. Evil: Evil people are trying to conquer an d oppress good people. Stronger good people (that’s us) must respo nd in the name of humanity. 2. Freedom vs. Slavery: The good people who are being attacked are brave, free, heroic people. They are led by a great “freed om-fighter.” 3. The domino effect: If we don’t stop the evil people now, they will conquer other countries and eventually take over mo st of the world — leaving the U.S. isolated and facing an overwhelmin g foe. We would suffer incalculable damage, if we even survived. 4. No background: There is virtually no recognition of the historical context in which the war is taking place. It’s as t hough history began the day the war started. 5. Sacrifice: We must give up more of our freedoms — e conomic and personal — in order to remain free. 6. No dissent: We must all pull together to defeat thi s wicked foe. We shouldn’t be questioning our leaders now; we can do that after the war. Now, we must obey them, do our patriotic duty, and win this war. To do otherwise is anti-American. 7. When the war is over, we will have a better world — better than it was before the war. One or two of the elements of the package might be omitted for a given war, but the overall approach is always there. It’s a tried-and- true formula. We will see how it has been employed in each of America’s wars over the pa st century. Of course, when the war is over, most Americans are n’t interested in questioning whether our leaders did the right thing. People are relieve d the war is over, glad to get back to normal and on with their lives. It’s left to the hi storians to dig up the truth years after the fact — at a time when few people care what the trut h is. But when that truth surfaces, Our schools give our children an Aesop’s-fable pict ure of each war: bad guys wanted to take over the world, Americans stopped them. "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 208 There’s no discussion of the events that led up to the war — the long-standing feuds between nations, the previous oppressions that may have provoked the attack that supposedly started the war, the nature of the gover nments who are pictured as our heroic allies. If Americans had been taught how politicians have s old previous wars to the public, they would be much less susceptible when they see the pr opaganda pattern being used to sell whatever is the current war. And if children had been taught in school that the Founding Fathers devised the Constitution as a way to limit government , not the people — and why it’s so important to limit government — those children would be much les s willing as adults to give up their own freedoms in wartime. Perhaps the greatest mistake Americans have ever ma de was in letting government educate their children. We will look at the lies, exaggerations, and omissi ons that have been used to draw Americans into war over and over again — and to kee p up their support during each war. After each war, the lies have lived on as myths tha t make it easier to sell succeeding wars (“I suppose you would have done nothing about Hitle r”). Despite the propaganda, some wars have remained con troversial. The promises made for World War I were so thoroughly refuted by events th at the war doesn’t stand as a shining moment in American history. The Vietnam War has a v ery poor reputation. Even the Gulf War of 1991 has faced widespread criticism in the press. But one war has stood the test of time. No matter h ow much cynicism prevails about American wars in general, World War II maintains it s reputation as the one “just war.” So I think it’s fitting that we begin our examinati on of the wars with the big one — WWII — because a closer look reveals that it was so ld to the American people as deceptively as any other war.

"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 209 2. Incident Necessary to Build War Fever It was necessary to maneuver a potential enemy into firing the first shot in order to rally the American public to go war. 3. War goals change Both in preparation for war and as the war progress es, the goals of the war change frequently. “Defending freedom,” “protecting human rights of foreigners,” “resisting attack,” “creating a new order.” 4. Demonization of the Enemy The people in the enemy nations are demonized as wh ole people or a race — soldiers and civilians alike. This, of course, is collectivism — assuming that everyone of one color, economic class, or nationality is responsible for s ome good or bad deed. Atrocity stories are circulated by our government t o enhance this image of the enemy as pure evil. Because the enemy has been demonized, our governmen t abandons the principles of civilized war — attacking civilians and private pro perty. The people in the enemy country leaders, soldiers, and civilians — all deserve whatever barbarities are inflicted upon them. 5. Intrusions on Civil Liberties “If you aren’t an enemy you have nothing to worry a bout.” 6.

Political Leaders Running the War Need a construct about the wars being prosecuted ef ficiently. The constant pep talks that the tide is turning, et c. — when the war is actually run by politicians. We’ll see in the ensuing chapters how efficient they are. MISCELLANEOUS LIES Dishonest reasons for American military interventio n: Defending human rights, protecting American interests, keeping the oil flowing, stopping the next “Hitler,” taking a moral stand, and so on.  G POWER We hear of atrocities and aggression committed by f oreign autocrats — Saddam Hussein’s torture chambers, Josef Stalin’s killing of innocent people, Adolf Hitler’s aggression against peace-loving countries. We accep t the fact that such inhumane people — committing such inhumane crimes — do exist in the real world. But we refuse to believe that American leaders woul d authorize similar crimes — attack a foreign country without just cause, authorize tortu re and other atrocities, intentionally bomb innocent civilians."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 211 Why wouldn’t our leaders do such things? Because Am ericans have a different culture. We’re peace-loving and we believe in the dignity an d sovereignty of individual human beings. So our leaders are more humane than the for eign dictators we hear about. But the foreign autocrats don’t commit atrocious ac ts because they come from a different culture. They commit them because they have the power to do so . Because you’ve never had that kind of power yoursel f, it may be difficult to understand how intoxicating it is — how much it can change you, change your values, change your priorities. Once you have the power to send your countrymen int o war and thereby stand a chance of becoming a “great” President, you can always fin d people who will justify your going to war. Once you have the power to kill civilians as a way of winning a war, it is easy to believe you have a moral duty to do so. Once you have the power to authorize torture as a w ay of getting information from captured prisoners, it is easy to convince yourself that you’re doing it to save lives. And it doesn’t matter what country you grew up in. It doesn’t matter what your religious beliefs are. It doesn’t matter what your countrymen believe is acceptable behavior. None of those things matter because the deciding fa ctor isn’t culture; it’s power. If the power is there, it will be abused. And it doesn’t m atter whether you’re Iraqi, German, Russian, African, or American. As Michael Cloud has said, “The problem isn’t the a buse of power; it’s the power to abuse.” Give politicians the power, and it’s only a matter of time until it will be abused. That’s why it shouldn’t be a shock that nine out of ten reasons George Bush gave for attacking Iraq have proven to be false — or that As sistant Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was able to convince George Bush that the nature of terrorism justifies using torture on captured prisoners — or that 1,200 Ameri can deaths and 100,000 Iraqi deaths are a small price to pay to bring democracy to Iraq (even if there’s absolutely no evidence that Iraq will be democratic or that democracy coul d make Iraq a better place). And it shouldn’t have been a shock if John Kerry ha d been elected and abused power in the same way George Bush has. The problem is not the man. The problem is the powe r he has."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 212 We have to find a way to take that power away from every President to come.   H Miscellaneous Notes WHAT WAR REALLY IS How war differs from the glorious national enterpri se portrayed in John Wayne movies; it is the physical and mental destruction of families, homes, and cities. COLLECTIVE GUILT There is no such thing as collective guilt, because only individuals think and act. They may join together in a group, but each is responsib le for his own actions. "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 213 And those who have taken no part in an action canno t be held responsible for what some other individual or group does. Thus not all Germans killed Jews, or even sanctione d the killing of Jews. Not all Americans killed Branch Davidians at Waco i n 1993, or even sanctioned the killing of anyone. Not all Arabs attacked Israel. Not all Afghans or S audis attacked the World Trade Center. ISOLATIONISM I continually see remarks that isolationism has fai led — usually accompanied by one- liner such as “Look at what happened with World War II” or “Pearl Harbor.” Take a few examples of those and show that each case it wasn’t isolationism, it was interventionism that caused the problem. The Three Elements Liberty - Security - Empire. We're told that we must give up some liberty for th e sake of security. But that's not true. For most of our history, Americans enjoyed both lib erty and security from foreign threats. But, as Tim O'Brien has pointed out, while it's pos sible to have both liberty and security, you can't have an empire as well. Once the American government decided to run the world, Americans were forced to choose between libe rty and security – because you can't have all three. Once you become an empire, either l iberty or security must go. Most likely, however, we will lose both liberty and security. We're losing our liberties, but innocent Americans will continue to be hurt by terrorists because of what our government is doing overseas. History of Intervention "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 214 It isn’t necessary to determine whether America was traditionally interventionist or isolationist. It is only necessary to determine whe ther intervention is right or wrong for America. However, it is also true that as America became str onger, politicians saw intervention as more likely to be successful — and thus a useful ro ad to bigger government.

"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 215 DOES THE TRUTH MATTER? For each war, the politicians’ lies create a contra st of white and black, good vs. evil, the righteous vs. the depraved. Everything our side doe s is well-intentioned and humanitarian. Everything the other side does is cru el and base. It might be argued that this is necessary in order to rally the American people to support a necessary war. But politicians are human beings. If you hand them a blank check — the power to go to war against anyone they choose and the freedom to lie about the facts without sufferin g bad consequences — you can expect the worst. Not just t he worst for innocent foreigners who will be bombed — but the worst for the American people who will have to pay for the war, in lives and money, and who will be put at risk when enough foreigners become so angry at the U.S. that they start supporting thu gs who want to commit terrorist acts against American citizens. By not demanding strict evidence of the truth, we h ave allowed the politicians to define what a “necessary war” is. As a result: • Americans invaded Panama, kidnapping its dictator, but making Panama’s drug situation (the ostensible reason for the war) worse than before. • Americans bombed Serbs, supposedly to stop “ethnic cleansing” in Kosovo — and then left the scene to the Albanians w ho “ethnic cleansed” the Serbs. 1990s The 1990s were the interim between the Cold War and the so-called War on Terrorism. You would think that this would be a period of rela tive peace. No chance. War is too valuable to politicians.

WHY POLITICIANS LIKE WAR The department of Defense bureaucracy has to have s omething to do. The government rewards friends of the administratio n with military contracts. And once the arms are built, they have to be used in order t o justify the expenditure and to keep the thought of threats alive. Most people believe war is good for the economy. It ’s actually good economically only for those who receive the government contracts. But politicians aren’t economic geniuses, and they believe a war can get the countr y out of a recession. In the so-called War on Terrorism, the politicians have given blanket immunity from private lawsuits to any countries contracting with the Homeland Security Department. This includes airline security companies and vaccin e manufacturers. This couldn’t be justified in peacetime. MONROE DOCTRINE Not a part of the Constitution.

The futility of retaliation and containment can be discussed there. RETALIATION It is very easy to believe that retaliation is esse ntial when attacked. But retaliation achieves nothing except a brief emotional release a t a cost of many innocent lives. If retaliation were successful, the Israelis and Pa lestinians would be at peace, the Indians and Pakistanis would have stopped fighting long ago , the Serbs and Albanians would never have battled in Kosovo. But in reality each act of retaliation calls forth retaliation by the other side. And so the death toll is more than just those killed in the re taliation; it must include all those killed in the endless cycle that follows. Americans like to believe that they are exempt from this principle — that Americans overwhelming might can so devastate the enemy that no further retaliation against the U.S. is possible. But America’s might is really a p aper tiger. • The U.S. Air Force destroyed North Korea, but had t o settle for a tie — leaving the Korean peninsula just as it was before the 3-year war began. • America might overwhelmed the North Vietnamese, but still America lost the war. • American might devastated Afghanistan, but it faile d to bring peace, liberty, or stability to the country. • America quickly defeated the Iraqi army, but as I w rote this Americans were still dying there, the people weren’t free (be ing occupied and ruled by a foreign power), large sections of the country were without electricity, clean water, or medicines, and there was no victory in sight. "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 219 CONTAINMENT The policy of containment is equivalent to signing up for life-long service in a never- ending war.

HISTORIANS ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH Referring to the blackout and then criticism in 194 7 of one of the early books, George Morgenstern’s Pearl Harbor: the Story of the Secret War revealing the truth about American entry into the war, historian Harry Elmer Barnes said that one historian reviewing it: . . . concluded that all or most of the statements in the book were true but that the book as a whole was a “great untruth.” Thi s reverses the usual line of the current apologists for the Roosevelt foreign policy, like Thomas A. Bailey and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., who now agre e that most of Roosevelt’s public statements thereupon were untrue but that his program as a whole was a great truth which exemplified the des irable procedure of the “good officer” — the conscientious public servant. 4 REALITY OF WAR It requires a determined mental act to recall that what happened was not an entry on a tally sheet but the violent death of a human being, loved and cared for by a mother and father, and full of hope and possibility, torn apar t by lead balls or shreds of sharp metal, his intestines hanging open, or his mouth coughing blood, in a last paroxysm of pain and fear. And then to recall that any justification for a war has to be a justification for this reality.

It is the imposition of heavy taxes on you and on o ther Americans and on people in other countries -- taxes that remain long after the war i s over. It is the suppression of free speech and the jailing of people who criticize the government. It is the imposition of slavery by forcing young me n to serve in the military. It is goading the public to hate foreign people and races -- whether Arabs or Japanese or Cubans. It is numbing our sensibilities to crueltie s inflicted on foreigners. It is cheering at the news of foreign pilots killed in their planes, of young men blown to bits while trapped inside tanks, of sailors drowned at sea. Other tragedies inevitably trail in the wake of war . Politicians lie even more than usual. Secrecy and cover-ups become the rule rather than t he exception. The press becomes even less reliable. War is genocide, torture, cruelty, propaganda, dish onesty, and slavery. War is the worst obscenity government can inflict u pon its subjects. It makes every other political crime -- corruption, bribery, favoritism, vote-buying, graft, dishonesty -- seem petty. Government's Role"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 224 If government has a role to play in foreign affairs , it isn't to win wars, to assure that the right people run foreign countries, to protect inno cent foreigners from guilty aggressors, or to make the world safe for democracy -- or even a safer place at all. If government has a role, it can be only to keep us out of wars -- to make sure no one will ever attack us, to make certain you can live your l ife in peace, to assure you the freedom to ignore who is right and who is wrong in foreign conflicts. The only reason for military power is to discourage attackers, and -- if they come anyway -- to repel them at our borders. Such things as sta tioning troops in far-off lands, meddling in foreign disputes, and sending our children to fo reign countries as \"peacekeepers\" only encourage war. To make America safer and to assure that we stay at peace, we don't need to put more weapons in the hands of government employees, or to reform military purchasing methods, or to make more treaties with other govern ments, or to increase the military budget. In fact, we need just the opposite of these things. We need to make it as hard as possible for politicians to involve us in war. And we need t o create a defense system that relies as little as possible on the normal workings of govern ment.   American Foreign Policy Hasn't Changed in 25 Years by Harry Browne"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 225  October 20, 1976 (The article excerpt below was published in 1976 in Harry's investment newsletter, Harry Browne's Special Reports. It is in the context of a discussion of the presidential debate between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. At that time, the U.S. government was leading an international coalition to overturn the governme nt in Rhodesia, because the government was run by white politicians, while the majority of the population in Rhodesia was black . (The effort succeeded. Rhodesia became Zimbabwe, ru led by Robert Mugabe, and all the concerned citizens of the world immediately turned their attention to the next place to impose their utopian ideas. (Robert Mugabe still rules Zimbabwe. And today it i s a land of terror. Roving bands of thugs, supported by the government, kill farmers an d businessmen and steal their property. As you might expect, American politicians and diplomats have long since lost interest in Zimbabwe; they completed their \"good wo rks\" there decades ago. Today they are busy bringing \"peace\" and \"justice\" to Serbia, Afghanistan, or Iraq.) . . . When a reporter asked [President Gerald] Ford if the U.S. intervention in Rhodesia meant that American foreign policy now called for u nseating dictators everywhere, I thought he was laying a trap. When the President sa id, in effect, that the answer was yes, I expected the reporter to ask if that included the communist countries. Of course, the reporter didn't ask that. But surely , I thought to myself, Carter wouldn't pass up such an opportunity. What better way to get Ford tongue-tied and trapped in a corner? But Carter, too, let it pass. The whole subject of communist countries would have been ignored if Ford hadn't lost his head and blurted out that the Eastern European countries were free of Soviet influence. Apparently, no one wanted to win the ele ction. I wish the U.S. government would keep its paws out of all foreign countries — communist or noncommunist. But I can't understand w hy no public figure has pointed up the inconsistency in U.S. foreign policy. The polit icians count it a matter of morality to strong-arm the governments of Rhodesia and South Af rica — but not any communist governments. "},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 226 Apparently, it's a sin for white men to rule black men — but not a sin for white men to rule white men or black men to rule black men. Overlooked are the Rhodesians, black and white, who have worked so hard for so many years and generations to create some property for t hemselves. The odds are overwhelming that the country will be in a shambles in ten years — as has been the case after so many other \"liberation\" movements. Do you remember the dreaded Mau Maus — the sadistic guerrillas who were in the news in the 1950s for slaughtering people in Kenya? Thei r leader was Jomo Kenyatta. Do you remember him? Have you ever wondered what happened to him? Was he executed for murder? Were the Mau Maus stamped out? No. Jomo Kenyatta is today the president of Kenya — and is one of the African leaders whose opinions appear to be so vital to American fo reign policy experts. Does America's future really require catering to such people? The meddling in Africa is justified by saying that it will bring peace to Africa. But where is the war? Only guerrillas are invading Rhodesia. Then why not go after the guerrillas? It's interesting to note that part of Henry Kissing er 's deal with the Rhodesian government is a U.S. guarantee that the guerrilla attacks will end. If the U.S. has the power to make good on such a guarantee, why hasn't it already sto pped the guerrilla attacks? Doesn't its humanitarian concerns extend to the innocent farmer s who have been killed? All supposed justifications for U.S. intervention c ontain one unspoken assumption — that the U.S. will be successful in its objectives. But where has it been successful before? In Vietnam? In Angola? Anywhere? And next year, when t he bully has moved onto some new failure and is beating up on someone else, we w ill have forgotten the promises for peace by which the 1976 bullying was justified. And American foreign policy is a bully policy. Bullies don't pick on anyone of eq ual size. That's why the U.S. isn't bullying the Soviets — or Red China — or even Castro. . . . Error!

Was the Gulf War a Just War? by Harry Browne February 20, 1991 "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 227 Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty. John F. Kennedy, 1961 President Kennedy's ringing declaration of war agai nst the enemies of liberty has echoed down the decades. Unfortunately, it's difficult to know which are the friends and which are the foes, because the U.S. government keeps shuffling them around. Although Joseph Stalin had already established his credentials as a mass murderer, the Soviet Union was pictured as our heroic ally during World War II. But after the war it was once again the enemy — the justification for tr illions of dollars in defense costs. The Germans, every last one of whom had been consid ered morally responsible for the Holocaust, became our friends and the bulwark of fr eedom in Europe. And the \"dirty yellow devils\" of World War II were de-colorized an d made our allies in Asia. Throughout the Cold War the roles kept shifting. Ri chard Nixon, who had opposed Red China for so many years, wound up drinking champagn e with Mao Tse-tung and Chou En Lai — and he joined forces with them against the Soviet Union. (This in turn caused the Chinese on Taiwan to be reclassified from brave freedom-fighters to predator merchants who flood the U.S. with cheap goods.) Then Mikhail Gorbachev showed up, and the Soviet Un ion was our friend again. The U.S. accepted him as an ally because he claimed he was replacing the old Soviet system of rule by the whim of a dictator with a state gove rned by \"carefully drafted laws.\" Now the laws have been carefully drafted and implem ented. They allow the state to seize anyone's property at will and the president to rule by decree, while private business can operate only within the most narrow bounds. Dissent will be allowed, but only when it doesn't bother the dictator. When the new laws were announced, Soviet tanks and soldiers invaded Lithuania to deliver the news. (1) Mr. Gorbachev's new oppression is particularly awkw ard for us because it's too soon after the Tiananmen Square massacre to embrace the Chines e again. Assuring the Success of Liberty "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 228 During the past 45 years, the U.S. government has p erceived threats to freedom and peace in virtually every corner of the Earth and re acted accordingly. The government has shipped money, equipment, and soldiers to over a hu ndred nations. There have been U.S. military campaigns in Greece, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Lebanon, Libya, Grenada, and Panama — plus, I'm sure, other countries that I've forgotten. In addition, t here has been less-direct meddling in Nicaragua, El Salvador, the Philippines, and dozens of other countries. In every case the cause was just, and the issue was a clear-cut, black-and-white case of good vs. evil. Each crusade had a limited and speci fic goal — which would be achieved quickly and at no great cost. FUTILITY But, in fact, no lasting victory has ever been acco mplished. After every crusade, the evil that justified the bl oodshed remained — or, as in the destruction of Germany and Japan in World War II, w as replaced by an even greater danger. Every temporary burden has become permanent , and has been piled on top of all the temporary burdens we were already suffering. The U.S. invaded Panama (\"Operation Just Cause\") to capture Manuel Noriega and round up the drug-smuggling evidence necessary to convict him in an American court — an unprecedented act. It turns out that no evidence wa s found, and Mr. Noriega still hasn't been tried. It appears that a lot of people died in Panama for nothing more than a boost in George Bush's approval rating. The Panamanian outcome wasn't unique. The Korean st alemate, undertaken to demonstrate that aggression can't succeed, didn't d eter the communists from invading — and eventually conquering — South Vietnam and Cambo dia. Nor did the Vietnam war accomplish anything. The do minoes kept on falling — with or without American resistance. U.S. Marines died to save Lebanon, but the Syrians overran it anyway. After all the U.S. maneuvering in the Philippines, the government ther e is still worthless and corrupt. After years of U.S. military aid to force a free election , Nicaragua continues to be run mostly by the hated Sandinistas. "},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 229 The U.S. is still sending foreign aid to African di ctators, bribing other governments to participate in the Middle East Coalition, and keepi ng troops at outposts all over the world. American soldiers still patrol the streets o f Panama and Grenada. And even though the Cold War was declared to be finished a year ago , American troops remain hunkered down in Europe. Every campaign began with the assumption that the c rusade would be brief and the benefits lasting. But after sacrificing millions of lives and trillions of dollars, what does the U.S. have to show for it? The Perpetual War Continues Now America is at war in the Middle East. What will it cost in lives and dollars? When will i t end? After the war, how long will U.S. troops have to remain in the Gulf to keep the peace ? For how many years will American taxpayers be bled for the costs? George Melloan, a Wall Street Journal columnist, has suggested that: Iraq should be occupied, primarily by the U.S., Bri tain, and France, with sufficient power retained to intimidate Syria and, if necessar y, Iran. . . . Military government of the type that established democracy in West Germ any and Japan after World War II is what is needed. (2) Even if that suggestion is ignored, American troops probably will remain in the Mideast for years — possibly decades. But that doesn't mean there will be peace, freedom, or \"democracy\" in the region. And since the causes and crusades never stop, there will be another urgent need somewhere else as soon as this one gets stale — or maybe even before then. Wherever the battlefield, the justification will be so compe lling that we'll have no choice but to fight — to repel aggression, to defend freedom, or for some other cause. This is what historian Charles Beard in 1947 so pro phetically labeled the \"perpetual war for perpetual peace.\" To the war-makers, there will always be an urgent reason to go to war to secure the peace. (3) PEOPLE ARE DYING "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 230 What if it had been your son or daughter who died i n the invasion of Panama? Would you feel today that he had died in a worthy cause? Suppose a loved one had gone with the U.S. Marines to keep the peace in Lebanon and died there. What would his death have accomplished? Now Americans are dying in the Arabian desert. For what great purpose are they giving their lives? Five years hence, what could be said t o a wife to make her husband's death in 1991 seem to have been necessary? If the Middle Eas t continues to be a cauldron of dictators and wars, how could you persuade her that her loss served a higher objective than the love of a man and a woman for each other? The Middle East casualties are human lives — as pre cious to other people as those of your children, your relatives, and your loved ones are to you. People are dying, and the survivors will be no better off for the sacrifices. Of course, the war-makers consider the deaths to be \"regrettable,\" but they don't volunteer to sacrifice themselves. It's just too ea sy to talk about the necessity of \"dying for a principle\" when they aren't the ones who will die. So often I've heard someone say \"there are some pri nciples we should be willing to die for.\" Or \"I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees.\" Such statements roll off the tongue easily because the speaker assumes that he w on't be the one to die. What he's saying is that his objectives are important enough for someone else to die. And if someone would choose to die for his country, I would pity him. Life is the most precious thing there is. It's sad to think that som eone's life held so little pleasure and meaning that he would willingly sacrifice it for a cause. Iraqi People Volunteer soldiers are a minority among the casualt ies. The biggest devastation is being visited on innocent civilians and on foreign soldie rs who've been drafted — people who didn't ask to be part of a war. So far, most of the dying people are Iraqis. Since their religion and culture are so alien to us, it's easy to think of them as being somehow les s human than the people we know. Both the U.S. and Iraqi governments have strong pro paganda motives to exaggerate the differences between them and us. Both governments w ould like us to think that the Iraqis are fanatics who will fight to the death to support Saddam Hussein. "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 231 But most likely the majority of Iraqis live in terr or of their own government — just as the majority of Germans did during the reign of Adolf H itler. The Iraqis are human beings like us — people with f amilies, striving for life and love. And they are dying in greater and greater numbers a s the war rolls on. Even those who survive will have had their homes turned to ashes a nd their lives devastated. Are we so godlike that we can condemn innocent peop le to die for the Emir of Kuwait and his 70 wives, for Saudi Arabia's borders, for G eorge Bush's vanity, or for other causes they never agreed to support? It's easy to be cavalier about the casualties. But, at the very least, your homeland or family ought to be at stake before you would consid er taking the life of even one innocent person. Glibness & Death To personalize the war, describing it as not agains t the Iraqi people but against Saddam, is morally equivalent to bombing a prison b ecause one has a grievance against its sadistic warden. (4) Robert Higgs, 1991 One of the worst things about war is the hysteria i t feeds — leading people to say and do things that ordinarily would shock them. The common \"man-on-the-street\" sentiment seems to b e \"I think they should level Baghdad to get that S.O.B.\" One columnist put it this way: There hasn't been much reason to say, \"I'm proud to be an American\" lately, but the bombing of Baghdad provided one. (5) People talk about what must be done to Saddam Husse in. But the people being hurt are the innocent civilians and soldiers who would prefe r to have nothing to do with either side of the argument. "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 232 To carpet-bomb Baghdad would be to murder thousands of innocents — merely for the satisfaction of getting Saddam Hussein to (as Georg e Bush put it) \"leave Kuwait with his tail between his legs.\" Understand how politicians think: They've passed la ws to prohibit the military from sending an assassin into Iraq to kill Saddam Hussei n, but they have no qualms about killing the thousands of innocent people who are fo rced to serve him. WHY WE FIGHT [George Bush] was clearly bent on war all along. Bu t he got his foot in the door by pretending otherwise. First he put troops in Sau di Arabia on the pretext that his sole purpose was to prevent an Iraqi invasion. Once they were there, he switched to a new goal: the \"liberation\" of Kuwait. Now he says his purpose is not the destruction of Iraq, even as he hints of a war crimes trial for Saddam Hussein and Baghdad is close to starvation and epidemic. Mr. Bush's rationales for war — stopping aggression , protecting our vital interests, oil, jobs, New World Order and sheer alt ruism — have been notoriously kaleidoscopic. The sheer abundance of reasons impli es that none is the real reason. Yet even this incoherence served a purpose: It prevented debate from focusing on any single argument. His critics were f orced to run around stamping out one verbal brushfire after another, as he kept starting more. If he had stuck to one clear reason, he would have lost the debate. (6 ) Joseph Sobran, 1991 If you're going to kill a lot of people, you'd bett er have a good reason. So why is America at war? There seems no shortage of reasons. In fact, George Bush has come up with dozens of reasons. Secure Borders Fantastic political boundaries are set up carelessl y and arbitrarily, but once they are established, however casually and lightheartedl y, they take on some mysterious sanctity; to violate them \"breaks the he art of the world.\" Every border war becomes a world war, and world peace disappears from the scene. By this absurd policy, internationalism and interve ntionism invite and insure \"perpetual war for perpetual peace,\" since any move which threatens petty"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 233 nations and these mystic boundaries becomes an \"agg ressive war\" which must not be tolerated, even though to oppose it may break th e back of the world. (7) Harry Elmer Barnes, 1953 The first reason given for the aggressive U.S. resp onse was that Iraq had outraged the world by failing to respect the Kuwaiti border. And thus began the moral posturing. President Bush requires that the sovereignty of Kuw ait be inviolate, but not the freedom of Lithuania or Latvia. The reason for his Baltic p acifism, of course, is that he wouldn't dare pick a fight with a power big enough to fight on equal terms. You call Saddam Hussein a \"Hitler\"; you call Mikhail Gorbachev \"Sir \". I'm not suggesting he should challenge the Soviet U nion over the Baltic states. But it's fraudulent to claim there's a sacred principle at s take in Kuwait, but not in Lithuania. Our Ally Kuwait But, we are told, Kuwait has been our friend – ofte n siding with the U.S. in quarrels involving other Middle Eastern states. But why was the U.S. involved in those quarrels in the first place? And what future quarrels do we have to prepare for? The Middle East has been a center of turmoil for hundreds of years — and especially since 1945. But every new president brings into office the colossal conceit that he can sort things out and make them right for everyone. Prior to being invaded last August, Kuwait was the second largest donor to the Palestinian Liberation Organization — the terrorist PLO. And until Yassir Arafat took the side of Iraq in the current conflict, the largest d onor was Saudi Arabia. (8) The fact is that there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" sid e among the endless quarrels and shifting political sands of the Middle East. The wh ole business is none of our business. Oil The only practical reason offered for our intervent ion is the idea that we need Middle East oil. "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 234 Oil is vital to the world. But does it justify kill ing thousands — or millions — of innocent people? Will the U.S. go to war if the Soviet Union decides to withhold platinum from the market? Or if South Africa chooses not to sell us a ny more uranium? Actually, as columnist Stephen Chapman has pointed out, neither the supply of oil nor the price of it was altered by the Iraqi invasion of Ku wait. What caused the price of oil to soar was the rash U.S. response — which threatened a Gulf war that would endanger the supply of oil. Even with all the blustering, howeve r, the price of oil eventually settled down. The assumption — as faulty here as in so many amate ur economic analyses — is that owning or controlling the oil makes Saddam Hussein rich. It doesn't. Selling the oil would make him rich. He has as much reason to price it at the market and make it available to us as we have to buy it. But even if he were crazy enough to blow up all the oil fields of the Middle East, America could survive without them. What makes it difficult to survive without imported oil are the absurd U.S. environmental policies that preclude drilling for oil in pristine U.S. areas that only one American in a thousand will ever see. If George Bush would stand up to environmental fana tics as fearlessly as he does to desert dictators, we could have both oil and peace. The New World Order We call Saddam Hussein or Manuel Noriega a serious threat to our interests because he is manifestly not a serious threat at al l. If there were any chance that he could light up the skies over Washington as we a re lighting up the skies over Baghdad, Mr. Bush would not be taunting him and cal ling him a Hitler; he would be negotiating and posing for photographers with hi m, and calling him \"our partner in the peace process.\" (9) Joseph Sobran, 1991 Eventually President Bush lit upon the idea that th is crusade is to establish a New World Order — one in which aggressors will know that they face sure and swift retaliation."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 235 But we already have that. We've had it since 1918, when World War I made the world safe for democracy (at a cost of 26 million lives), and the League of Nations was established to guarantee peace and the security of all boundaries. If not since then, at least since 1945 when the win ning of World War II bestowed the Four Freedoms upon everyone (at a cost of 36 millio n lives), and the United Nations guaranteed the safety of all people. Or at least since the U.S. proved in Korea and Viet nam (at a combined cost of 112 thousand American lives alone) that no boundary cou ld be violated with impunity. (10) To enforce the New World Order, we have the Coaliti on. It includes the Soviet Union — which unfortunately can't send troops to help repel the evil Iraqis because the troops are busy right now t yrannizing Lithuania. The Coalition also includes Syria, which thoughtful ly interrupted its destruction of Lebanon long enough to send its respects (but not i ts money or much of its manpower) to our crusade. Maybe if Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assa d continues to hold Mr. Bush's coat, the president will remove Syria from the State Depa rtment's list of terrorist countries. The U.S. has had to buy the support of almost every government that has either joined the Coalition or agreed not to oppose it — from bribing Egypt with $7 billion to giving trade concessions to the Chinese. Your tax dollars at wor k on behalf of the New World Order. The surprising thing is not just that the president can speak of a New World Order with a straight face, but that so many people actually tak e him seriously. The Modern-Day Hitler George Bush has labeled Saddam Hussein the new Hitl er, creating a further reason we have to stop him now — right now — because if we do n't, he'll take over the whole world tomorrow. Remember Munich. Neville Chamberlain performed an invaluable service to war-makers. By agreeing at Munich to Adolf Hitler's conquest of part of Czecho slovakia a year before the outbreak of World War II, he provided a metaphor that every war-maker can use with impunity: \"Don't let Kuwait [or Vietnam, Korea, Grenada, Sout h Africa, the North Pole, you name"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 236 it] be another Munich.\" We either stop the madman n ow, or we'll have to do it later when it will be much harder. No one has to bother proving that Mr. Chamberlain's actions at Munich led to — or aggravated — World War II; it is simply assumed tha t they did. However, some people have suggested (also without convincing proof) that the Munich agreement gave England time to prepare itself for World War II, and thereb y prevented a Nazi victory. Whatever the case, Hitler and Munich provide the pe rfect metaphors whenever anyone wants to meddle in a foreign dispute. The argument always assumes that the new Hitler wil l be stopped. But many of the previous Hitlers (in Korea and Vietnam, for example ) managed to survive such attempts. The original Hitler was stopped, eventually, but at a cost of millions of lives. Stopping Aggression Another reason George Bush has offered for his crus ade is that we must establish the precedent that aggression of any kind will not be t olerated. It's ironic that the first Allied gain of the war w as the retaking of the Kuwaiti island of Qaruh — which Coalition member Saudi Arabia then cl aimed for itself. Six days before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Saudi and Iraqi oil ministers held a public meeting to announce that they were deciding which o f the two countries would get each of the Kuwaiti islands. (11) And now Syria, Iran, and Turkey are eagerly awaitin g the end of the war so that they can fight over the remains of Iraq. So which aggressor will the New World Order have to repel next — Syria, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia? Choose for Yourself Of course, reasonable people can disagree about any of these points. And if someone believes strongly enough that war is justified, I wouldn't try to stop him from volunteering or hiring out for a campaign to l iberate Kuwait. Nor would I object if he wants to contribute money to the project."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 237 But I don't believe that anyone's belief is justifi cation for sending others to die, nor for confiscating the money of others to finance the war . FOREIGN WARS & SANCTIONS America can only be harmed by this war. Our kids ki lled, our liberties suppressed, our taxes raised, the government engorged, the rece ssion deepened, our Constitution shredded — and you can hardly wait for the shooting to start. Ad by Jews & Christians Against a Mideast War, 1990 Is there an alternative to this war? Yes, there is. But it isn't the sanctions that were imposed by the U.S. and the United Nations. Sanctions are ridiculous. Like war, they'r e a way that one group of people forces another to pay for a cause favored by the first gro up. The sanctions hurt innocent people in Iraq and innocent businessmen elsewhere. Why sho uld they have to sacrifice for someone's political objectives? Sanctions are an instrument of selective indignatio n. Whenever they're invoked against anyone, similar villains are conveniently ignored. No sanctions were considered when Soviet tanks roll ed into Lithuania and Latvia. George Bush was too busy giving speeches against aggressio n to pay much attention to the Baltics. He had time only to ponder whether to reco nsider sending the billions of dollars worth of free food he'd promised to Mr. Gorbachev. The alternative to war is to do nothing. There is n o reason for the U.S. to make things right in the Middle East — nor is there any hope th at it can do so. If Saddam Hussein is dispatched to Moslem Hell and Iraq becomes a model democracy, there will be another crisis somewhere nearby next year. No Foreign War Is a Just Cause I'm not saying I'd support the war if the situation were different. I don't believe in killing innocent people. And I d on't like to see anyone deciding under what circumstances other people should die for a ca use. (12) "},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 238 The only time to consider force is when the United States people are threatened directly. Short of that, I'm not likely to be persuaded that force of any kind is called for. An attack on the U.S. is more likely to come by mis sile than by an invading armada. If someday Saddam Hussein will have missiles, then som eday we should have a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). If there is a valid reaso n to have a government, it must be to defend against intruders — not to become an intrude r. SDI would cost a fraction of the bill we're paying for troops, bombers, missiles, and the like. But politicians apparently reject it precisel y for that reason — because it would be less likely to become the boondoggles that national defense and worldwide alliances have become. (Those who laughed at \"Star Wars\" and now p raise the Patriot anti-missile missiles are trying very hard to avoid making any c onnection between the two.) MARCHING ON TO VICTORY This Administration today, here and now, declares u nconditional war on poverty in America, and I urge Congress and all Americans t o join with me in that effort. It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won. Lyndon B. Johnson, 1964 (13) All the reasons discussed for sending America to wa r assume that the U.S. government will achieve its objectives, that no unintended con sequences will ensue, and that the only question is whether a particular motive is sufficie nt reason to start a war. But this is government we're talking about. The War on Poverty has been raging for 25 years, bu t now we're told there are more poor people than ever. For almost as long, our privacy a nd money have been sacrificed to wage the War on Drugs, but not one city has been li berated. There are hundreds of gun- control laws in the country, but murders with firea rms continue as always. The government can't seem to educate our children, it certainly won't make the environment pristine, and it doesn't deliver the ma il on time. And yet, for some reason, people who know all those things believe this same government will accomplish its military and diploma tic objectives in the Middle East"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 239 perfectly. Even though every other government progr am produces terrible side effects, somehow this one will miraculously achieve just wha t you want (whatever that is) without lighting the fuse for World War III (or Pol ice Action #79) in the process. People thought the same about Korea, Vietnam, Leban on, Nicaragua, and many other places. WHY IS THERE A WAR? War is the health of the State. Randolph Bourne, 1917 Perhaps I'm overreacting, but I find it hard to esc ape the conclusion that the only benefit of the war has been to provide a diversion from Geo rge Bush's domestic problems. The war has given him a sky-high approval rating an d taken the recession off the front page. In November his reelection seemed unlikely; t oday it seems assured. (However, the election is almost two years away, and by then toda y's euphoria may have long since been forgotten.) George Bush has his own reasons for war, and only h e knows what they are. The stated objectives — reacting to atrocities, guaranteeing l ow oil prices, and the like — are merely window dressing. The Unfolding of George Bush It is difficult for men in high office to avoid the malady of self delusion. They are constantly and, for the most part, sincerely assure d of their greatness. They live in an artificial atmosphere of adulation and exhilarat ion which sooner or later impairs their judgment. They are in grave danger of becoming careless and ignorant. Calvin Coolidge, 1929 During the presidential campaign of 1988, I conside red Mr. Bush to be an intelligent man — a gentleman in fact (even though the press tried to portray his campaign as mean- spirited).

I guess we should have stopped him at Munich. RESPONDING TO WAR My opposition to the war isn't based on the fact th at Kuwait and Saudi Arabia support the PLO, that Coalition-ally Syria is a terrorist state , that sufficient oil is available within the U.S. without fighting over Gulf oil, that President Bush is spouting dangerous nonsense about a New World Order, or that Saudi Arabia itsel f is salivating over Kuwait like a mongoose at a cobra convention. All these contradictions and hypocrisies are standa rd procedure for politics and international relations. President Bush, Saddam Hus sein, Yassir Arafat, and the other actors in this dreadful tragedy are simply doing wh at they were born to do. And we can't stop them. But we debase ourselves when we support their schem es — when we nod our heads and pretend we don't really see the contradictions and self-interest lurking under the high- minded oratory. And that is why you should separate yourself from all this — from their world, a world in which coercion, intrigue, double- dealing, violence, and lies are the rule. You don't resort to deceit and violence to get what you want in your business or your personal life. Why should you respect people who do ? You're better than the politicians and the war-makers; there's no reason to sink to th eir level and endorse their jingoism. I'm not suggesting that you join the protestors.

It may have been \"a dangerous world out there\" for others, but it wasn't for us until the meddling of our leaders made it so.

Murdering for Morality by Harry Browne June 03, 1999 I recently received a letter from a Libertarian who supports the NATO war against Serbia. He writes: \"I see that the Libertarians are against the 'war' (or whatever it is) in Serbia, lest as ol' Abe Lincoln did some years ago, the state would gro w. Gladly do I appreciate the fear of a growing state. \"Yet to leave a mad dog such as Milosevic alive aft er such a butchery shows a level of callousness that I can not accept and still cons ider myself as moral. \"True, there are other places such as the Sudan whe re we are not intervening. That absence is no excuse not to intervene somewhere. Th at somewhere at present is Serbia. And if nothing is done and Milosevic keeps his job, that means that in this evolving New World Order, the institution of govern ment has the acknowledged, if unofficial, right to butcher its own citizens, to k ill 'we the people.' \"That can not be tolerated: mad dog governments mus t pay a price, even if there is a fear of enlarging governments.\""},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 246 I understand your concerns, but I believe that, in your sympathy for some people, you're overlooking many other people -- and overlooking th e consequences that would flow from getting what you want. First, if you believe everything you've read about the \"butchery\" and \"callousness,\" and if you feel that your ability to \"consider [yourself] moral\" hinges on your doing something, then do it. But do you consider it moral to condemn to death ot her people, who are as innocent as you are, to satisfy your moral outrage? Do you cons ider it moral to force Americans who don't agree with you to pay for the instruments of death and destruction that are currently raining down on the guilty and innocent alike in Yu goslavia? Second, how did you arrive at your understanding of the \"butchery\" and \"callousness\"? Your appraisal necessarily is based mostly on what has been filtered through the Clinton administration and NATO headquarters. Bill Clinton's reputation for veracity is probably the worst in the world. This is the man who told you \"the era of big government is over\" an d \"I did not have sex with that woman,\" and who made up tales about church-burnings in his childhood and dozens of other fantasies you're probably well acquainted wit h. Is this the source for your knowledge about \"brutality\" and \"callousness\"? NATO has violated its own charter by waging war whe n none of its member nations has been attacked. So it is under strong pressure to de monize its enemy -- and can hardly be considered a reliable source of information. You were told by NATO that it had not bombed a trai n carrying Kosovar refugees, that Milosevic himself had done it -- but then NATO admi tted it had bombed the train, but claimed that Milosevic had used the refugees as hum an shields. And then NATO admitted that everything it had said was wrong, and that NATO had caused \"a tragic accident.\" You were told by NATO that the reason it has caused many innocent people to die in embassies and civilian installations is because it is using out-of-date maps. You were told by NATO that tens of thousands of you ng men had been murdered by the Serbs -- but, when pressed for evidence, NATO backe d up this claim by saying a pilot had seen a freshly plowed field from thousands of f eet up -- a field that NATO, with no further evidence, declared to be a mass grave."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 247 You were told by NATO that Milosevic has murdered a ll the leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army -- but then the Los Angeles Times ( May 17) reported that all the dead leaders were still walking around villages in Kosov o -- and that even the Kosovars discount most of the news of Serbian atrocities. This isn't to say that Slobodan Milosevic is really a good guy. He's a political thug, like so many world leaders. But what source of informati on has caused you to decide that thousands of innocent people must be put to death i n order to make this particular thug pay a price? Third, have you considered how this war will set a precedent for future wars? The pundits applauded when Harry Truman illegally c ommitted American troops to fight the Korean War. But that just made it easier for Jo hn F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to illegally commit troops to fight in Vietnam -- whic h made it easier yet for Richard Nixon to illegally bomb Cambodia, a neutral country. And that made it still easier for George Bush to commit troops to fight illegally in Iraq. And these precedents removed all possible restraint s on Bill Clinton, so that he could willy-nilly bomb and kill innocent people in Iraq, the Sudan, Afghanistan, and now Serbia, Kosovo, Bulgaria, and Albania. How easy it will be now for the next president to b omb presumed drug fields in Mexico - - or terrorists supposedly hiding in Canada. Or per haps he'll start a nuclear war with China, based on classified, non-public information that China is about to invade Taiwan. Or what happens when China decides some future Bran ch Davidians are being oppressed by the American government? On what moral basis cou ld you argue that China has no right to rain bombs on innocent people in Texas, in order to make our \"mad dog government\" pay a price? Fifth, note something very closely: North Korea rem ains an apparent threat almost 50 years after Truman's bold stroke to involve America in Korea. North Vietnam won its war against America and today controls all of Vietn am -- despite the death and destruction unleashed by Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. And in spite of America's great \"victory\" in Iraq, Saddam Hussein remains on the throne there -- to be used as a bogey-man with which our government can threaten it s own people. So what did all those illegal interventions achieve? And what will the il legal destruction of Yugoslavia achieve?

Isn't your morality something that is supposed to govern your conduct, rather than decide the fate of others? Statists have always justified \"collateral damage\" -- the killing of innocent people -- by saying, \"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.\" But it's always someone else's eggs that get broken . And no matter how many eggs are destroyed, the omelet never materializes. And thus we have perpetual war for perpetual peace -- a peace that is always promised, but never arrives, no matter how much killing and k illing and killing is justified by the search for peace. If Slobodan Milosevic truly were threatening Americ a, an American President could post a reward of, say, $250 million -- to be given to wh oever in the world succeeded in assassinating him. But, whatever he really is, we k now one thing for certain: Milosevic isn't threatening us. Your concern for some people entitles you to do -- on your own -- whatever you can for those people.

By Harry Browne July 6, 1999 Many Americans objected to President Clinton's bomb ing of Yugoslavia -- without a declaration of war by Congress and with no threat o f attack against the United States. You might be one of those who think it's wrong to b omb innocent Serbs for the alleged sins of one man. By attacking a smaller country without provocation, our president invited the resentment of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, as wel l as the active interest of terrorists who might want to react to such a dangerous foreign policy. Who gave President Clinton the authority to jeopard ize our future in this way? Well, maybe you did. Even if you opposed Clinton's bombing campaign, you still may have authorized it. If you cheered when President Reagan sent troops in to Grenada, you endorsed the idea that the president of the United States -- at his o wn discretion -- is free to wage war against anyone he chooses, for any reason he choose s. He need not get a declaration of war, and America need not be threatened with attack .

We can't allow a communist government in the Western Hemisphere, or a drug dea ler to rule Panama, or naked aggression to succeed in the Middle East.\" Or a dictator to oppress his subjects in Kosovo? The circumstances may seem different to you, but no one asked you -- and no one ever will. When you supported the previous U.S. attacks, you said that a president should be free to choose his own targets -- without the const itutional requirement that Congress deliberate long enough to issue a formal declaratio n of war, without the commonsense requirement that our land and lives must be threate ned, and without asking you first. I don't say these things to reproach you, but rathe r to warn you to beware in the future when you're tempted to hand your favorite politicia n the power to do good. You will simultaneously be handing some future reprobate the power to do bad. If you approved when President Reagan took a stand against terrorism by bombing Libya, you shouldn't have been surprised when President Cl inton took a stand against terrorism by bombing a Sudanese perfume factory. If you give a \"good\" president the power to do good , you are paving the way for a bad president to exploit that power to do bad. You won' t always have your choice as president, and you will never get to choose his tar gets. Power doesn't distinguish between right and wrong. Once the power is granted, it will be used -- and used for whatever purpose pleases whoev er has it. And the greater the power, the more likely that ruthless people will seek cont rol of it. So why should you give such power to any president? As P.J. O'Rourke said, that 's like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys. Politicians will always use your support as a prece dent to do whatever they choose. And this doesn't apply only to war making. Give the politicians the power to ban assault rifle s and you give them the power to ban any kind of self-protection you might want to rely on. Grant the politicians the power to give vouchers fo r private schooling and you grant them the power to tell private schools what to do. Do these examples seem far-fetched? Such possibilit ies always do when raised in advance. But when you give politicians the power to do anything, they never stop at the point where you think they've done enough."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 251 Libertarians know the goal isn't to assure that onl y the right people get elected to positions of power.

Mr. Kerrey has claimed that he and his men were ret urning fire in the night and didn't know they were killing civilians. The argument over whether his actions were justifie d misses the point.

But their stirring phrases are meant to keep our eyes averted from what war really is. War is your children or your grandchildren dying be fore they're even fully adults, or being maimed or mentally scarred for life. It is yo ur brothers and sisters being taught to kill other people -- and to hate people who are jus t like themselves and who don't want to kill anyone either. It is your children seeing thei r buddies' limbs blown off their bodies. It is hundreds of thousands of human beings dying y ears before their time. It is millions of people separated forever from the ones they love d. It is the destruction of homes for which people wor ked for decades. It is the end of careers that meant as much to others as your career means to you. It is the imposition of heavy taxes on you and on o ther Americans and on people in other countries -- taxes that remain long after the war i s over. It is the suppression of free speech and the jailing of people who criticize the government. Often it has been the imposition of slavery by forc ing young men to serve in the military. War allows the politicians to goad us to hate forei gn people and races -- whether Arabs or Japanese or Cubans -- so we become insensitive to c ruelties inflicted on them. It is cheering at movies or news footage of \"their\" pilot s killed in planes, of \"their\" young men blown to bits while trapped inside tanks, of \"their \" sailors drowned at sea. Other tragedies inevitably trail in the wake of war . Politicians lie even more than usual. Secrecy and cover-ups become the rule rather than t he exception. The press becomes even less reliable. War is genocide, torture, cruelty, propaganda, dish onesty and slavery. War is the worst obscenity government can inflict u pon its subjects.

Such things as sta tioning troops in far-off lands, meddling in foreign disputes, and sending our children to fo reign countries as \"peacekeepers\" only encourage war. To make America safer and to assure that we stay at peace, we don't need to put more weapons in the hands of government employees, or to reform military purchasing methods, or to make more treaties with other govern ments, or to increase the military budget. In fact, we need just the opposite of these things. We need to make it as hard as possible for politicians to involve us in war.

And whatever they are, you can have no expectation of ever getting th em back – even if the underlying"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 263 problem goes away completely. For just one obvious example, income tax withholding was instituted as a war measure in 1942, and it is still with us today. Second, taking away our liberties rarely achieves t he goals used to justify the new oppression. Because of the drug war, our government now rummages through your bank's records, looking for suspicious transactions you may have entered into; you and your property can be searched and seized without a warrant, without being convicted of anything, without even being accused of anything. A nd yet drugs are as widespread today as when these intrusions were put in place. It's easy to say you support intrusions that you be lieve aren't likely to affect you personally. But I can assure you that any invasion of civil liberties will affect you more than they do the truly guilty (who will quickly lea rn about the invasions and how to circumvent them). World War II \"What about the situation in the 1930s, where the B ritish under Chamberlain tried to appease rather than oppose Hitler, with horrible re sults?\" Many historians believe that if Chamberlain hadn't signed the Munich pact in 1938, but had instead gone to war immediately with Germany, a n unprepared England would have been defeated easily. Instead, the delay gave Engla nd time to get ready to resist Hitler – and even then, a better-prepared England just barel y survived. But \"Munich\" has become an all-purpose cliché to ju stify striking out violently against any foreign power that displeases our politicians: \"If only Hitler had been stopped at Munich!\" (as though at the time anyone had the reso urces to stop him). We need something more substantial than clichés to prevent future terrorist attacks. \"There are people like Adolf Hitler who are pure ev il. You can't hide your head in the sand and pretend they don't exist. Our government m ust intervene overseas to root them out – just as we did in World War II.\" There are people with diseased minds in every part of the world – from your neighborhood right on up to heads of state. Once yo u accept the idea that a preemptive strike is justified, where do you stop? It is easy to cite World War II as an example of ou r government's proper intervention in world affairs – but only if you start the story in the 1930s, just as people are starting the terrorist story at last Tuesday."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 264 In 1917 World War I was winding down to a close. Ge rmany was suing for peace. A negotiated settlement was close, and the world coul d have returned to its pre-war borders and peace. But it was not to be. At that point Woodrow Wilson took America into the conflict. That intervention changed history irrevocably for the worse. Millions of fres h American soldiers streamed into Europe – tipping the balance of power and overwhelm ing an enemy exhausted from three years of war. Germany and Austria surrendered, the German emperor fled to the Netherlands, and the Allies imposed devastating con ditions upon a defeated Germany. America's action transformed a functioning Germany with Kaiser Wilhelm on the throne into a prostrate Germany eager for revenge. And so a nation of great artistry that had produced the likes of Goethe and Wagner was willing to accept a dictator who promised to help them get even. The humanitarian spirit that propelled America into a war to \"end all wars\" laid the groundwork for two of history's worst murderers – J osef Stalin and Adolf Hitler. Although no one can say for sure, it seems very lik ely that if America had stayed out of World War I there would have been no World War II. And without that war and without a Soviet Union, there would have been no Cold War, no Korean War, no Vietnam War. The 20th century wouldn't have been an era of perfe ct peace, but it would have avoided being history's bloodiest 100 years. Could Woodrow Wilson – or anyone else – have forese en all this in advance? No, and that's the point. Once you embark on the use of force – for any purpo se – you have no idea what will fly up out of Pandora's box. If you don't look for the causes that precede the e vents, you have no hope of ever preventing a repetition of the events. What the terrorists did last Tuesday was wrong. But if we don't inquire into the background, and instead go off around the world on a holy jihad of our own, we will unleash consequences none of us can predict. But we can be almost positive that they won't be to our liking. \"Don't you think that if we were to withdraw from t he Mideast, that eventually some Arab dictator would unite the Arab-Islamic world (v iolently) and pose a real threat to us?\""},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 265 Arab dictators aren't going to give up their fiefdo ms to a single ruler.

But that isn't likely to happen in the Middle East. And what you suggest could be possible anywhere in the world. Does that justify the U.S. running the entire world? (Speaking of a single dic tator!) \"Isn't it occasionally right to intervene on the be half of people that are being massacred, such as in Serbia?\" In a free country, you should be free to send money – or even yourself – to any country in the world to aid any cause you believe in (which, i ncidentally, isn't completely legal under federal law today).

I regret that I can't reply individually t o them. Nor is it possible even to reply in print to many of the thoughtful suggestions, compla ints, or proposals that readers have offered. But there is one common theme I can deal with here – one that runs through all the proposals for retaliation – the assumption that the retaliation can be done in a way that achieves many good purposes with no bad consequence s. It can be summarized in the statement, \"I believe w e can retaliate with few innocent people killed, and Afghanistan may be a better plac e when we leave.\" But something very important is overlooked in almos t every proposal I've received: When you believe the U.S. government can eradicate the terrorist threat, you're assuming it will design, create, and carry out the plan the way you imagine it. When you endorse the idea that our government shoul d invade Afghanistan, or occupy the Middle East, or conduct \"surgical strikes\" agai nst terrorist sanctuaries, or round up a particular class of people within the U.S., you aut omatically assume it will be done as you imagine – with no bad side effects.

The program you support will be carried out by the same kind of people who bombed a pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan, who fired crui se missiles into the terrorist camp that wasn't there in Afghanistan, who saw American troop s humiliated in Lebanon and Somalia, who went to war with Iraq to keep oil plen tiful but then forcibly prohibited the buying of most Iraqi oil afterward, who were going to stop Panama from being a drug conduit and instead left Panama completely defensel ess against the drug trade. That doesn't mean the same kind of failures will ha ppen again, but it does mean almost certainly that what you propose is not what you'll get. What's overlooked in the support for unleashing the military, the FBI, the CIA, and other crime-fighting or war-making agencies is simply thi s: The government that's supposed to win the War on Terrorism is the same one that's bee n waging the War on Drugs, the War on Poverty, the War on Crime, and the War on Illite racy. Perhaps we should pay more attention to its track record. President Bush said, \"We will rid the world of the evil-doers.\" Perhaps he could start with Washington, D.C. – and if he gets rid of the evil-d oers there, he could move on to some other part of America – and if he succeeds there, h e could extend the program to the rest of America – and if he succeeds there, he could ask the Canadians if they want our help – and if he succeeds there, he could go on to the Mex icans, the Haitians, the rest of Latin America, and then the Europeans, and so on. But start with the whole world? Doesn't that seem a little pretentious for a government with such a sorry record of failures? If that sounds flippant, I'm sorry, but I get prett y tired of hearing all these promises made to justify taking more of my life away from me – wh en none of the thousands of promises made already has come even close to being fulfilled .

That's why libertarians are so all-fired determined to reduce government to as small an entity as we can – where it can do as little damage as possible and be used as little as possible for someone's gain at someone else's expen se.

Before looking at those proposals, however, we need to establish some ground rules. Perfection Isn't an Option Rule #1: No solution is going to be perfect. Our government has created ill will in many parts o f the world. It has bullied smaller countries, imposed new governments upon people who didn't want them, and demanded that other governments do what our government wants . It's unrealistic to think that there's anything that can be done now to quickly undo all t he ill will. I have been criticized for dwelling on what our gov ernment has done that led to the terrorist attacks. But if we don't understand what provoked this, we can't evaluate any response to it — and we can expect that the faulty policies will continue and provoke more such attacks against Americans. Foreign Policy Is the Issue Rule #2: It is American foreign policy that has pro voked the attacks, not anything inherent in Muslim fundamentalism."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 271 There are hundreds of millions of Muslims in the wo rld who don't believe in killing non- Muslims. In fact, Muslims have been killed in Arab terrorist attacks, just as non-Muslims have. In an interview conducted by John Miller for Esquire in February 1999, Osama bin Laden said: \"This is my message to the American peo ple: to look for a serious government that looks out for their interests and d oes not attack others, their lands, or their honor. And my word to American journalists is not to ask why we did that but ask what their government has done that forced us to de fend ourselves.\" The fact that bin Laden uses bad means to achieve h is ends doesn't excuse our own government's mistakes; nor does it justify our gove rnment doing the same things he does. Bombing Doesn't Work Rule #3: Bombing foreign countries doesn't end terr orism, it provokes it. Our government has bombed Libya, Iraq, the Sudan, a nd Afghanistan, among other countries, supposedly to teach terrorists a lesson. But the bombings haven't caused terrorists or foreign governments to change their p olicies. This Is a Crime, Not War Rule #4: The terrorist attacks are a criminal matte r, not a war. War is by definition an armed conflict between gove rnments. No government has claimed responsibility for the September 11 attacks , and no government has been so accused. Calling the present situation a war is an excuse to impose wartime policies against Americans and foreigners — including violations of the Bill of Rights and killing foreign civilians. Because the September attacks were a crime, the gov ernment's job is to locate and bring to trial any perpetrators who didn't die in the att acks. If some of them are located in foreign countries, our government should request ex tradition — not threaten to bomb the foreign country if we don't get our way. If not all the criminals are found and brought to t rial, it doesn't mean that bombing innocent people would have brought the criminals to justice. Reverse Positions Rule #5: If you think you or America is entitled to something, reverse the positions and see how you'd react."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 272 If Afghanistan doesn't turn bin Laden over to our g overnment, ask yourself whether you'd want your government to turn you over to the Iranian government if it accused you o f a crime. If you don't think that American troops in almost a hundred foreign countries are a source of resentment, ask yourself how you'd feel if Chine se troops were stationed in your city. If you believe America has a right to bomb foreign countries for the actions of a few, ask yourself whether you'd want foreign governments to bomb your city because of something Bill Clinton did. (Haven't we already est ablished that the terrorists were wrong to kill innocent civilians because of their hatred for American foreign policy?) Government Is Incompetent Rule #6: Government does not do anything well — eve n those functions delegated to it by the Constitution. The government has the constitutional authority to operate a Post Office. But if it's urgent that a package get to the other side of America by tomorrow morning, will you trust the constitutional Post Office or will you use Federal Express? Don't assume that just because the government has t he legal authority to do something that it will actually succeed. So be careful what y ou ask for. What Is the Object? Rule #7: There's no way to eliminate all terrorism in the world. Terrorists have existed since Biblical times. There will always be such criminals — people who will kill innocent bystanders to make a social or political statement, or to bring pressure on a government to change its polici es. Saying that terrorism will be eradicated is not onl y unrealistic, it is asinine. It indicates that the speaker shouldn't be trusted in anything e lse he says. What is realistic is the goal of reducing considerably the threat of terrorism against the U.S. In my next two articles, I'll present proposals for achieving this.

It probably won't eliminate any of them. But it will make the politicians feel good. And it will satisfy the understandable lust for vengeance that so many Americans feel right now. But not only will foreigners die by the thousands, it will feed the desire for vengeance on the part of the terrorists — and inspire other peop le to help them. The result? . . . • We will be attacked on planes, in subways, building s, schools, sports arenas — in any place innocent Americans can be cornered like lab rats. • Our economy will sink further and further downward as people become more and more afraid to lead normal lives. • We will see Americans die from bombs, from biologic al warfare, from assassinations, and from causes we can't even imagine now. Our government will react by escalating the violenc e still further. And that will cause the terrorists to escalate their violence. And with eve ry escalation, more of our friends and relatives will die — and more people around the wor ld will come to hate America. Choice #1 doesn't lead to anything very pretty. It will be disastrous for America. But that's where our politicians are taking us right no w.

Americans are loved all over the world for what the y've done — producing low-cost food and medicines, great entertainment, and the kind of voluntary charity that only free and prosperous people can bestow.

If American leaders would call a halt to the violen ce, condemn the terrorist attack, and condemn the killing of innocent foreigners by previ ous U.S. administrations, there's a very good chance the cycle of death and destruction could end immediately. We're at a Crossroads Can I guarantee that Choice #2 will lead to peace? Of course not, but it is very likely to do so. And what terrorism remains will be relativel y minor compared to the awful future we face now. And I can assure you that Choice #1 will lead to th e deaths of many more Americans — most likely, tens of thousands (or hundreds of thou sands) of Americans, in ugly and tragic ways. It's very possible the terrorists who weren't kille d in the September 11 attacks will never be caught — whether we pick Choice #1 or Choice #2. So let's focus instead on assuring that such a thing never happens again. But first we must recognize that the fantasy our go vernment is peddling now — of bringing peace by killing foreigners — is just that : a fantasy. We have only two choices — death or peace.

In fact the main reason most people tolerate high t axes and invasions of our liberty is because they hope the government will protect them from domestic criminals and foreign problems. And yet, despite a $2 trillion budget, ou r government protects us from neither. A libertarian foreign policy would rest on a simple principle: We're always ready to defend ourselves, but we thre aten no one. Such a foreign policy should have four elements. 1. Non-Interference Our government should never interfere in other coun tries' disputes, never arm nor aid foreign governments, and never give terrorists a re ason to pressure our government. When the politicians drag us off to someone else's war, they offer plenty of reasons. The reasons usually include: stopping the conflict from spreading, heading off the emergence of a new Hitler, protecting our allies, doing the m oral thing, and ending violations of human rights. But rarely do they come even close to achieving any of the goals."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 277 Any American who wants to volunteer to fight for a foreign government or revolutionary movement, to negotiate its peace, or to send money to help it should be free to do so. (It is currently illegal for you to help a foreign gove rnment or revolutionary movement.) But our government should stay out of such battles. 2. No Foreign Aid or Military Assistance The Constitution grants our government no authority to use your money for the support of foreign governments. Not only is it unconstitutional, it is unfair by al most any standard. As Fred Smith pointed out, foreign aid taxes poor people in rich countrie s for the benefit of rich people in poor countries. Foreign aid originally was justified as a way of ar ming countries against Communist aggression. But Cuba, China, and Vietnam all became Communist after receiving American money and weapons. And so much money and military hardware have been g iven to Israel's enemies that it allows the politicians to say we have to give massi ve aid to Israel to keep it from being destroyed. Every American should be free to send money or weap ons to any government in the world. But you shouldn't be taxed for the benefit o f any foreign government. 3. Security against Attack How could the bad people of the world conquer Ameri ca? They'd have to pulverize American cities to the poi nt that we submit to being occupied — or they'd have to threaten to do that. In 1983 Ronald Reagan made the most sensible milita ry suggestion of the past 50 years — that America should protect itself against missil e attacks. Unfortunately, he gave the job to the Department of Defense — which is really the Post Office in fatigues. And so 18 years later we're no closer to being protected t han we were in 1983. We should rely as little as possible on politics an d bureaucracy to achieve anything. The government should simply post a reward — say, $25 b illion — to go to the first private company that produces a functioning, fool-proof mis sile defense. With such an offer, we'd probably have a missile defense within five ye ars. Will that make us perfectly secure? Of course not. Nothing will."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 278 But it will make us far safer than we are today and eliminate a principal excuse for meddling in other countries' affairs. 4. Target the Aggressors, Not the Innocent Even with a missile defense, suppose America truly were threatened by a foreign ruler. A Libertarian President would target the aggressor himself. He wouldn't order bombers to kill the aggressor's innocent subjects. He would warn the ruler that an actual attack would trigger the posting of a reward of, say, $100 million for the person who kills the rule r. Everyone would be eligible to collect the reward — including the ruler's guards and wives . This response would spare both innocent foreigners and innocent Americans. Only those who try for the reward would be at risk. Americans wouldn't be drafted to fight and die invading a foreign country — nor taxed to pay for v olunteers. This isn't a way to force dictators to change their spots or submit to U.S. dictation. It's only a way to discourage a direct attack on America . If the dictator withdrew his threat, the U.S. would withdraw the reward. With a libertarian foreign policy, it's unlikely an y foreign ruler would threaten us. So such a reward probably would never be posted. But i f a foreign ruler were tempted to threaten us, the fear of assassination would be mor e of a deterrence than the threat to bomb his civilian subjects. If you don't believe assassination is a nice way to handle this, what's the alternative? Would you rather kill thousands of innocent foreign ers and innocent Americans? Peace for All Time When America can defend itself against missile atta ck, the politicians will lose their best excuse for butting into the affairs of other countr ies and making demands upon you. And when our government no longer interferes in oth er countries with military adventures and foreign aid, foreign terrorists will have little reason to threaten your city. If some foreign leader still tried to make trouble for America, we should target the leader for assassination, not target innocent civilians fo r bombing. But an American government that minded its own business and had a secure defen se isn't likely to need to resort to assassination. The policies I've outlined are the only ones that w ill produce a strong national defense, instead of a strong national offense, and leave ter rorists with no reason to attack us."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 279 Once they're in place, we must find a way to keep p oliticians away from loaded weapons forever.

They care little about the traveling businessman wh o now must cut his work short at lunch time in order to catch a 5 p.m. flight. Or th e individual who must get up at 4 a.m. to catch a morning flight. Has the president noticed the hundreds of billions of dollars being added to federal, state and local government budgets – spending piled on to p of previous budgets, spending that's causing huge deficits and tax increases, spe nding that's coming out of the hide of American taxpayers?

Why doesn't he simply tell the truth: \"America rule s the world and I rule America. You will do as I say, or I'll kill your people.\" Opposition The president keeps telling us that the world suppo rts the American war against Afghanistan. But the truth is that he has bought th e support of foreign leaders with your money – while public opinion polls show people in f oreign countries are overwhelmingly opposed to American military attacks. Why doesn't he just tell the truth: \"We are destroy ing the last vestiges of love for America around the world – but that's the price we must pay for me to become powerful and popular at home beyond my wildest dreams.\" Time for the truth When you know some of what politicians tell you are lies, you have to wonder how many of their other statements are lies as well. What I want is the truth. I'd like to think I'm mat ure enough to handle whatever that may be. And I could prepare for the future much better if someone told me the truth – instead of all this rah-rah stuff. America isn't leading the world. Leaders lead by ex ample.

They're willing to abandon the rule of law and tran sform America into a police state – where any law-enforcement agency, military court or intelligence agency can act as prosecutor, judge and jury to decide your future. They're willing to let innocent Americans die – by encouraging our government to bomb innocent foreigners at will, almost guaranteeing th at there will be further terrorist attacks against us. They're willing to continue transforming what was o nce a worldwide love of America into a hatred for America – caused by the correct p erception that American presidents believe they can force any foreign nation to do the ir bidding. They make no objection when congressmen pass bills – without reading them first or having any idea what's actually in them – bills tha t take away your liberties, pile more government debt on your family, and give the presid ent the power to do whatever he wants, as though he were a Roman emperor. Words and deeds These people may not actually hate America. They ma y even profess to love America, but they show no understanding of what made America the precious nation it is. Here is what some of their sentiments amount to: • Contrary to the American respect for peace-loving p eople, they think our hurt entitles us to hurt others – even people who didn't hurt us. • Contrary to the American tradition of individual re sponsibility, they want to treat all Afghans as though they're bin Laden, and all Ir aqis as though they're Saddam Hussein – making no distinction between the innocen t and the guilty. • Contrary to the American ideal of individual libert y, they think freedom may be a nice concept but state security is more important. • Contrary to the American tradition of independent t hought, they assert that questioning your government is unpatriotic, paranoi d and tantamount to treason."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 284 • Contrary to the distrust of government that marked the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, they think that – despite all the mistakes our government has made – allegiance to the fatherland is your highest duty. • Contrary to the American way of good will toward al l, they acknowledge that America is being transformed into an armed fortress , but say that's the price we must pay to be a superpower. Those aren't the sentiments of people who recognize what made America the most attractive place on earth to live.

But without realizing it, many of the protestors br ought these invasions on themselves. This is America? I do share their concerns, however. First, Congress rammed through an “anti-terrorism” bill that violates the civil liberties of all Americans, not just terrorists. The new law allows federal officials to search your home when you're not present and not even tell you your home has been searched. You coul d come home one day and find your computer, file cabinets and legal papers have disap peared. You'd naturally think it was a burglary, but the burglars would be government empl oyees (shades of Watergate). Warrants can be issued in secret, and you may not b e allowed to see a warrant – or contest it – covering a search of your property. This is America? Government officials can go into any company anywhe re and search records of your purchases and credit history, discover the websites you've visited, or monitor your e-mail – without evidence of a crime and without telling y ou, and they can order the companies not to tell you about the search. Then the Bush administration, apparently invoking t he divine right of kings, decided that people can be tried and executed by secret courts ( using secret evidence not available for you to refute), that government agents can eavesdro p on attorney-client conversations, and that federal agents can conduct searches withou t judicial oversight."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 286 This is America? And understand that the so-called \"War on Terrorism \" is only two months old. This is just the beginning. What's still to come?

We have a lot to look forward to. Don't be deceived! The press implies that the new civil-liberties inva sions will apply only to terrorists. Not true. They apply to you, because anyone can be suspected of being a terrorist – including you. In fact, the new definition of \"suspected terrorist \" includes people speaking out against government policies. And if law-enforcement officials are to decide whos e civil liberties will be denied, one of them may become convinced you're connected to the t errorists in some way, try you in a secret court, sentence you, imprison you and even e xecute you – with no opportunity for you to appeal the verdict or your sentence.

What they have a rrogated to themselves is the power to decide whether or not you will be protected by the Constitution. This is America? If you're not frightened by this, you're simply not paying attention.

There are two very important points we can learn fr om these events: Israelis and Palestinians have been using force to retaliate against attacks for over 50 years – each seeking to teach the other \"a lesson\" whenever attacked. But none of the lessons seem ever to have been learned. Forcibl e retaliation has failed completely to deter further violence. Whenever there's a \"terrorist\" attack in the Middle East, our president (whoever he may be at the time) always counsels \"restraint.\" So why don't our presidents ever practice restraint themselves whenever they claim t hat American interests have been hurt? Forcible retaliation never \"teaches a lesson\" becau se the people whose behavior you're trying to change aren't the ones who get hurt by th e retaliation. Ronald Reagan bombed Libya to teach Muammar al- Qad dafi that he shouldn't promote terrorism. A year later, a Pan Am plane crashed ove r Scotland. Our government is convinced the crash was caused by Libyan terrorists who apparently skipped school the day the retaliation lesson was taught.

But whatever should have been done at the time, wha t was done is now a fait accompli and isn't likely to be changed. And most of the peo ple displaced by the mandate are no longer alive. You'd think people in the Middle East today would prefer to forget how Israel was created, accept the current situation, a nd get on with their personal lives.

Obviously, all the money and military weapons the U .S. has poured into the Middle East (to all sides), all the treaties U.S. presidents ha ve brokered and all the demands made by American foreign policy have done nothing to bring peace to the region. Holy shrines Part of the reason that no solution seems satisfyin g is that too many people make the Middle East conflict a religious matter. And yet re ligious considerations should produce peace, not conflict. • Would Moses think it worth killing thousands of Jew s and Arabs to keep Israel based in Jerusalem? • Would Mohammed approve of the fanatical violence di splayed by modern Arabs over Jerusalem and Mecca? • Would Jesus have wanted the Christian Crusades to s laughter Saracens in order to keep Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre in Christian hands? It's hard to believe these religious leaders would have considered any religious artifact or location worth the murder of a single soul. Force the first resort But not so for political leaders.

Within eight years, the federal budget tripled, fed eral debt increased 155 percent and the gold standard was repudiated – making the U.S. doll ar a fiat currency.

Some people considered this a criminal act — not an act of war by a foreign nation. They said the U.S. government should concentrate on find ing, capturing, and bringing to trial anyone connected with the attacks. The people who wanted war said this approach was la ughable. They demanded that the doves lay out a fool-proof plan that would guarante e the capture of Osama bin Laden and anyone else involved in the attacks. Of course, no one could do that. And so the warmong ers carried the day — and the U.S. went to war against Afghanistan. What Has Happened? Now, four months later, what has been achieved? Many things . . . 1. Afghanistan has been bombed and bombed and bombed, just as many people wanted. The entire village of Kama Ado was wiped ou t, for example, killing 115 people who had nothing to do with the September 11 attacks. Reporters visited the remains and saw the fragments of U.S. A ir Force bombs. Another bombing, at Qalaye Niazi, killed at least 50 civili ans — apparently because a local anti-Taliban tribal leader, trying to intimid ate local citizens, told the U.S. military that Al-Qaeda forces were there. (For some reason, these events hold little interest for the American news media.) 2. Throughout Afghanistan, thousands of people hav e died from the U.S. bombing — even though American TV news cha nnels rarely report these deaths. No one has claimed that a single one of t he dead people had anything to do with the September 11 attacks.

Tens of thousands of Afghans are starving to death — in many cases eating grass to stay alive as long as possible. Afghanista n has always been a poor country; now it is a devastated one. 5. Because of the destruction, Afghanistan will ha ve to be rebuilt — at a cost of billions of dollars. And guess who's going to pay for it. That's right — you and 6.

Eggs & Wars According to the brave warriors, all these tragedie s are the necessary collateral damage that occurs in a war. After all, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. (Did you ever notice that the people who believe th is rarely volunteer their own eggs? It's almost always someone else who must suffer the \"col lateral damage\"?) But where is the omelet? Despite all the deaths and destruction, the devasta tion hasn't produced the capture of a single person claimed to be involved in the Septemb er 11 attacks. In fact, the only arrest so far of an actual suspect occurred in the United States, not in Afghanistan. Was the Right Choice Made? On September 12, America faced two choices: Treat the attacks as a crime, recognizing the possi bility that the perpetrators might never be captured. Treat the attacks as war — and rain death and destr uction on a backwards, third-world country that was powerless to fight back. Because choice #1 couldn't guarantee the capture of those responsible for the September 11 attacks, America went to war and decimated anoth er nation. But that choice didn't produce the capture of a single perpetrator. And so we have nothing to show for all the death an d devastation — nothing except the increased hatred of millions more people around the globe."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 296 Retaliation? We're told the U.S. has simply acted in self-defens e. After all, America was attacked. But what we've seen wasn't retaliation. If you hit me and I hit you back, I'm acting in self- defense. But if you hit me and I respond by hitting your sister, that isn't self-defense — it's aggression against your sister. The U.S. hasn't retaliated against the people who c aused the September 11 attacks. It has attacked an innocent nation and achieved nothing fo r it. And if retaliation is the right way, why is Preside nt Bush pressuring India and Israel not to retaliate for terrorist acts? Eliminating Terrorism? Our government says the war in Afghanistan is wipin g out Al-Qaeda, so that there can be no more terrorist acts. But our government also say s Al-Qaeda has members in 60 countries around the world. Does that mean there ar e only 59 more countries to bomb? So long as we're bombing defenseless countries, the re will be widespread resentment against the U.S. — and there will be terrorist acts against us, with or without Al-Qaeda. Teaching a Lesson? It is also said that, if nothing else, the bombing of Afghanistan will make would-be future terrorists think twice about attacking us. But why should the bombing intimidate a terrorist? After all, terrorists don't care when innocent people die. And no evidence has been prese nted that anyone involved in the September 11 attacks has been killed by the bombing s. Certainly Osama Bin Laden has no reason to feel int imidated by the American response. After all, the September 11 attacks have caused us to spend tens of billions of dollars in warfare and new domestic security procedures, turn our lives upside down, give up portions of the Bill of Rights, and delegate vast n ew powers to the government. What more could he want? Freedom for Afghans? TV news clips show happy Afghans shedding their bea rds and veils — while providing little or no coverage of the refugee camps and vill ages where people are starving.

And who could be so naïve as to believe the Norther n Alliance is going to rule Afghanistan in a more kindly way than the Taliban d id? U.S. troops will no more guarantee a free country than do the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. But once the war is over, our government and the press will no longer p ay attention to the Afghans. (The Kosovo Liberation Army — on behalf of which th e U.S. bombed Serbia in 1999 — has driven Serbs, Gypsies, Jews, Turks and other no n-Albanians out of Kosovo, \"ethnically cleansing\" the area far more efficientl y than Slobodan Milosevic ever did. But how much interest have TV journalists shown in retu rning to Kosovo to see what the U.S. intervention achieved?) Revenge? Lastly, has the bombing of Afghanistan at least giv en people the feeling they've avenged the Americans who died on September 11? No. Revenge can be achieved only by hurting those w ho have hurt you — not by killing innocent bystanders. The U.S. war on Afghanistan has produced nothing bu t misery. I don't know about you, but I feel no pride in know ing my government has slaughtered a lot of innocent people in my name. What to Do We will end the terrorist threats to America only w hen America changes its foreign policy. Our President must assure the world that he's repud iating the foreign policy of his predecessors — which rained bombs on countries like Serbia, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and the Sudan — and has propped up tyrannical dicta tors in countries like Iran, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia — and invaded countries like Iraq, Nicaragua, Somalia, and Lebanon.

In 1995, with roughly the same population, New York City had 1,499 murder s — and this was celebrated as an improvement. I was surprised to receive at least a half-dozen em ails from people complaining that this was a misleading factoid. They said the statement i gnored factors such as population growth (even though the population was roughly unch anged) or economic conditions. But the complainers miss the point. I wanted reader s to realize that there was once an America they know very little about. People born si nce the 1950s — before the Drug War, gun laws, and the Great Society — have little knowledge of the more peaceful, more widely prosperous, and more civil society that once was. And most Americans know little about today's events outside our borders. The TV networks don't seem to publicize anything that does n't advance the government's interest. As for history, most people know little more than t he one-liners they heard in high school. In short, when Americans ponder such weighty matter s as the War on Terrorism or other government programs, they often form important opin ions from simplistic history stories, government press releases, and TV News. The Other World of Knowledge There's a whole world of knowledge to which most Am ericans have never been exposed. For example, did you know that . . .? • It was only half-way through the Civil War that sla very became a significant factor. The major issue provoking the South to sece de was the tariffs that benefited Northern manufacturers and forced Souther n farmers to pay high prices for manufactured goods. • Child labor began dying out around 1900 as expandin g technology made workers more productive — enabling families to survive with out their children having to work. But the first important child-labor law wasn' t passed until 1938."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 299 • For almost all of America's first 120 years, there was no federal income tax — and few people complained that the government didn't ha ve enough revenue. • For those same 120 years, there was no Federal Rese rve System — and the federal government printed no paper money (except for Linco ln's Civil War \"Greenbacks\"). Consumer prices gradually dropped by a third between 1800 and 1913 — and banking crises were occasional and mild. But with the Federal Reserve in charge, prices rose 1,800% by 2000 and t he country suffered its worst- ever banking crisis in 1933. • If America had stayed out of World War I, there pro bably wouldn't have been a World War II. Without the U.S. to tip the balance o f power in 1917, the European nations would have reached an armistice that probab ly would have precluded the Communist takeover in Russia, kept the Kaiser in po wer in Germany, kept German territory intact, and left no grievances for Hitler to exploit in the 1930s. (Winston Churchill said: \"America should have minde d her own business and stayed out of the World War. If you hadn't entered the war the Allies would have made peace with Germany in the Spring of 1917. Had we made peace th en there would have been no collapse in Russia followed by Communism, and Germa ny would not have signed the Versailles Treaty, which has enthroned Nazism in Ge rmany. If America had stayed out of the war, all these 'isms' wouldn't today be sweepin g the continent in Europe and breaking down parliamentary government, and if England had m ade peace early in 1917, it would have saved over one million British, French, and Am erican and other lives.\") • The crime rate dropped by nearly 50% during the Gre at Depression — despite terrible economic conditions. The chief cause of th e improvement was the end of Alcohol Prohibition in 1933. (Think how much safer your city could be today if Drug Prohibition ended.) • Pearl Harbor wasn't an \"unprovoked\" attack by the J apanese. During the year before, Franklin Roosevelt pressured the Japanese t o withdraw from China, East Asia, and Indochina —imposing economic sanctions an d confiscating Japanese assets in the U.S. When the Japanese realized war w as inevitable, they decided to begin by destroying the U.S. Pacific fleet. • Almost every important American general or admiral said dropping the atomic bomb wasn’t necessary to end World War II. The Japa nese knew the war was lost and were already trying to surrender — but Roosevel t and Truman insisted on \"unconditional surrender\" and wouldn't agree to the Emperor remaining in power (even though he did remain in power after all). Well over 100,000 peop le died to no purpose."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 300 • Because consumers wanted safer ways to smoke, in th e 1960s tobacco companies offered filtered, low-tar, and low-nicotine cigaret tes — and advertised the safer ingredients. But then the government prohibited suc h advertising — removing any incentive for tobacco companies to make their produ cts safer. • Also in the 1960s, pharmaceutical companies develop ed beta blockers that kept blood flowing to and from the heart. But the FDA he ld these products off the U.S. market for six long years — although there were no reported problems in countries where the drugs were already available. T he delay caused an estimated 60,000 people to die prematurely from heart attacks . • Prior to the 1970s anyone could carry a loaded gun onto a commercial air flight. There were no metal detectors and no security guard s. And I don't recall a single report of a gun being misused on an airplane. • The U.S. Air Force has been bombing Iraq several ti mes every month for the past ten years, causing the deaths of thousands of innoc ent Iraqi citizens. • The U.S. has blockaded Iraq — keeping food and medi cines from reaching Iraqi citizens — causing a half-million Iraqis to die, ac cording to the United Nations. In 1997 then UN Ambassador Madeline Albright said, \"We think the price is worth it.\" • The Kosovo Liberation Army (on behalf of which the U.S. bombed Serbia in 1999) was considered a terrorist organization by th e U.S. State Department as late as 1998. Since the Serbian war ended, the KLA has d riven almost all non- Albanians out of Kosovo — \"ethnically cleansing\" th e area far more thoroughly than the Serbs supposedly did. Watch What You Ask For It isn't that \"America\" is always wrong. Far from i t. It is that government is a powder keg. Whatever its alleged purpose — to disarm criminals, make America drug-free, bring peace to t he world, alleviate suffering — it almost always makes things worse, and often creates enormous suffering. America became great because it relied far less on government than other countries did.

The following dialogue provides his opinions (indented, in quotation marks ) together with my replies, edited only slightly: \"I agree that rights should not be compromised and that exceptions should not be made. I do not agree that all rights are cre ated equal and absolute. The right to life and, by extension, the right to d efend ourselves must take priority over civil liberties. \"Let me illustrate. We defend free speech. However, if a person were giving a speech and someone threw a brick at the sp eaker, we would shout, ‘Watch out!' We would to try to save the speaker fr om harm even though we interrupted the speech. If the right to free spe ech were absolute and inviolate regardless of context, we would be commit ting a breach of ethics to interrupt the speaker under any circumstances. B ut it would be ethical to save the speaker's life even if it means abridging freedom of speech.\" \"Freedom of speech\" does not refer to any relations hip between you and the speaker. \"Freedom of speech\" means that \"Congress shall make no law abridging\" the freedom of citizens to express themselves on any subject. It h as nothing to do with your interrupting the speaker. Rules governing that are set by whoeve r owns the venue in which the speech is taking place — just as you can decide for yourse lf what can be said in your own home. \"Here's another example. A man should not be puttin g his hands on a woman without her permission. But suppose that a la dy is waiting to cross the street and decides to cross against the light. A man behind her sees a car bearing down on her just as she steps in its pa th. If the right to be free of physical harassment were absolute, the man would be ethically bound not to grab her and pull her back to the curb. But he should help her. Why? Because her right to life supersedes her right to b e free of physical coercion.\" You do not impede the woman because she has a \"righ t to life,\" but because you want to save her life. You will experience the consequences of your act. The woman may have been intending to kill herself, in which case she m ay hate you and malign you publicly ever after. Or she may thank you profusely for the rest of her life. In either case, you make the decision, you take the risk, and you exper ience the consequences of your acts."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 303 To transfer such an example to government is comple tely inappropriate. Politicians do not suffer the direct consequences of their own act s — and rarely even suffer indirect consequences. When they pass laws governing how peo ple must act on public streets, they never suffer themselves if the laws lead to te rrible consequences. And to use the example of your hoping to save the life of a woman on the street as an excuse to allow politicians to violate the Constitution supposedly for our own good is wholly inappropriate. The principal problem with these examples is that t hey are about individuals, while you're trying to draw conclusions regarding a natio n. We are not a collective. What one person does with another is of no relevance when di scussing what the government does to individuals. The Siren Song of Dictators \"I ask you: Is it better to torture a suspect to pr event your city from being consumed in a nuclear holocaust or to respect his r ights of person and due process and thereby suffer the incineration of a hu ndred thousand innocents and the creation of a nuclear wasteland? The rights of the suspect are not equivalent to the right to life of me, my f amily, my friends, and my community. It would be immoral not to try to force the suspect to stop the detonation even though it violates the suspect's ci vil liberties.\" It is examples like this that have allowed tyrants throughout history to arrogate to themselves the right to torture, to suspend due pro cess, and to ignore any tried-and-true rules of evidence in order to get what they want. A fter all, you don't want your city incinerated, do you? And don't forget that anyone can be considered a suspected terrorist. Once you give the government the power to torture, you could be the next \"suspected terrorist\" to be tortured. Why not? Are you going to have a court tr ial first, employing all the rules of evidence to be sure that some law-enforcement offic ial hasn't fingered you because of his incompetence? And what happens when it turns out th at you weren't guilty at all? Who will face dire consequences for having made \"an hon est mistake\"? And how will you put your life back together after a week of sheer horro r and a maimed body? \"It has been said that our rights are most essentia l when our neighbors think we do not deserve them. I answer that, if my neighbors have good reason to think that I am trying to murder them, th ey should stop me even if that means violating my rights.

Life and defense of lives are the ultimate rights.\" Once again, you are confusing your neighbors with t he government. If your neighbors hurt you mistakenly, they will face direct conseque nces for their acts. To use this as an excuse to give unaccountable government officials t he power to suspend your civil liberties (and there is no such thing as \"accountab le\" government officials) is to go the way of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany. \"I agree that if we allow our civil liberties to be subordinated to our self- defense, we will be in danger of all things being j ustified. We have currently before us a classic example of how the po wer-hungry try to feather their nests in the name of a worthy goal. I n the name of campaign finance reform, incumbent politicians are trying to assure their re-elections by prohibiting paid political ads — a clear violati on of free speech.\" Then why don't you apply this principle to civil li berties? The politicians who are trying to ram campaign reform down our throats are the sam e ones who would have the power of life and death over you if you suspend the last effective elements of the Constitution. Giving Them the Power to Do What They Want \"Government abuses and injustices will occur in the name of saving our lives. Those in power will sometimes be overzealous , dim-witted, inept, mistaken, corrupt, or ambitious.\" Not \"sometimes.\" Any power you give to politicians will inevitably be abused — if not today by the \"good\" politicians you give it to, the n tomorrow by the \"bad\" politicians who will succeed them. As Michael Cloud has said, \" The problem is not the abuse of power, it is the power to abuse.\" \"But is it not better to risk sliding down the slip pery slope of allowing our government to infringe upon our civil liberties tha n to suffer terrorists throwing us off the cliffs and dashing us upon the rocks?\" Once on the slippery slope, when have we ever been able to climb back up to regain lost liberties? \"We must subordinate our civil liberties to our sel f-defense not only for the ethical and philosophical considerations above, but also because of practical considerations.

Couldn't you be one of them once we descend another couple of feet down the slippery slope? It Hasn't Hurt Yet \"So far, the government's violation of our civil li berties has amounted to minor inconveniences for most and major disruptions for a few.\" This is the way these things always begin. \"I haven 't noticed any inconvenience.\" . . . \"If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about.\" . . . \"Honest people aren't afraid of their own government.\" Eventually, everyo ne is inconvenienced, everyone has something to hide, and everyone is afraid of his ow n government. \"And I see ways that we as individuals can exert pr essure on our government to moderate rights abuse.\" This is another mistaken belief that makes it easy for government to grow — the idea that you can give politicians power and then draw a line at exactly where you think that power should end. But you won't get to draw the line, and the politicians' power will eventually be unlimited. That's why the income tax today is 39 %, not the 6% it was at the start — why Social Security is 15%, not 2% — why every bank transaction is subject to government snooping, not just large transactions. Why We Are Threatened \"I don't see how we can alter either the mind set o r actions of those zealots who have been raised to hate us, who have devoted t heir lives to finding ways to destroy us, and who find their ultimate glo ry and fulfillment in our demise.\" Here we come to what, in my opinion, is the most im portant issue in this entire War on Terrorism — the idea that we have no choice but to cede to our own government unlimited power to fight people who won't rest unti l they destroy us."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 306 But there have always been thugs in the world who w anted to destroy others.

Why is it that only now do they represent such a grave threat to us that we must discard the last of what made America unique in all the world — the few remaining constitutional rights we possess? The truth is that the evil, malicious, brutal peopl e rarely have the ability to make any real trouble outside their own neighborhoods. The few ex ceptions, people like Adolf Hitler or Osama bin Laden, succeed only because they are able to get large numbers of people to support them — to provide the financing, the contac ts, the networking and other resources necessary to cause noticeable trouble. And that support comes from people who have been mi streated, as with the Germans after World War I — who had valuable pieces of Germ any torn off and handed to France, Poland, or Czechoslovakia — who had all their forei gn investments confiscated — who were told to pay astounding reparations, even thoug h all their valuable assets had been taken from them — who were made to bear the entire guilt for a war they were only one part of. Or the support comes from hundreds of millions of p eople around the world who resent American troops stationed in their country — who ar e appalled by the constant American bombing of Iraq — who have watched for 50 years as the Americans propped up dictatorial regimes in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanis tan, and other countries. The difference between relatively harmless brutes a nd brutes who are truly dangerous is that the latter have been handed real grievances to play upon. They are still brutes, but they gain the support of honest, peace-loving peopl e who have been pushed to the limit. You will never be able to subdue all the brutes of the world, especially if you kill more innocent people in the process — because the very a ct of trying will arouse even more resentments around the world. If you want to make the brutes relatively powerless to hurt us, you can do it only by taking power away from our politicians to interfere in foreign countries — not by taking away the last remaining rights of American citizens . (Incidentally, I find it hard to understand how so many Libertarians could have complained so loudly about American foreign policy for so many years, but now seem to refuse to pin any blame on that foreign policy for what happened on September 11. And even if they do say now the foreign policy was wron g, they also say that America is justified in bullying the world now, because of wha t happened on September 11, even though the current bullying is an extension of the very foreign policy they condemn.)"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 307 You Can't Control Them \"Therefore, we must support our government to stop these assassins by whatever means necessary.

Americans are claiming victory because American bom bers have devastated Afghanistan, thousands of Afghans have been killed, and the alre ady-impoverished country is now almost completely in ruins. But most likely this is exactly what bin Laden want ed. What has the devastation achieved? Osama bin Laden and Omar the Tentmaker are still on the loose. To the best of my knowledge, no one w ho had anything to do with the planning or execution of the September 11 attacks h as been captured or killed.

And don't get the idea that American military might has shown Osama bin Laden that he can't get away with his nefarious deeds. That concl usion is 180 degrees off the mark. Do you think Osama bin Laden cares how many innocen t Afghans are killed? Why would he? Every dead Afghan is another argument for his crusade. Hundreds of millions of people in the Third World a lready hate the U.S. — for bombing Iraq, for interfering in the Middle East, for keepi ng troops in a hundred countries, for propping up dictators who support American policies . And every bomb that fell on Afghanistan converted m ore people into America-haters. The U.S. military has been confirming bin Laden's a rgument that Americans are bullies. Around the World In the same way, ten years of U.S. bombing Iraq has n't forced Saddam Hussein to change his policies. Why should it? The bombs make his stu bbornness more popular at home. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel says he'll co ntinue to attack the Palestinians until \"the other side understands it cannot achieve anyth ing by using terror; [then] it will be easier to start negotiations.\" But why would terrorists care how many Palestinians die?

Hitler could command a very advanced, literate coun try because of the terrible treatment the Germans suffered after World War I. He promised to avenge the wrongs done to them, and they responded enthusiastically. If he ha dn't had that fertile ground to work with, we'd never have heard of him. Today, Osama bin Laden couldn't get the worldwide s upport necessary to carry out his evil plans if there weren't hundreds of millions of people who resent American troops stationed in their countries, who are appalled by t he American blockade that's starving Iraqis, who don't like American Presidents imposing their decisions on their countries. The difference between relatively harmless thugs an d truly dangerous thugs is the real grievances the dangerous ones can play upon. They a re still thugs, but they gain the support of honest, peace-loving people who have bee n pushed to the limit. You'll never be able to subdue all the thugs, espec ially if you kill more innocent people in the process because the very act of killing arouses even more resentments. By bombing Afghanistan, by killing people who had n othing to do with the September attacks, George Bush has handed Osama Bin Laden exa ctly the victory he craved — the evidence that Americans don't believe innocent peop le have a right to live if they get in the way of American global ambitions."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 311 The Terrorist Strategy If Bin Laden could mastermind the September attacks , he must be smart enough to know that bombing the World Trade Center (or any future terrorist act) isn't going to defeat America. So why did he do it? He could see an insecure American President, just b arely elected and worried about his reelection, who might jump at the opportunity to de monstrate leadership, play the macho President, start bombing, and feed the worldwide re sentment of American foreign policy. And so bin Laden has maneuvered George Bush into de stroying a poor, Islamic country — causing a further decline in support for America among the world’s peoples (distinct from their leaders who feed at the American trough) . Round 1 goes to bin Laden by something close to a k nockout. Defeating Terrorism We will never defeat terrorism by killing innocent people. That's exactly what the terrorists want us to do. You can make the thugs powerless only by taking awa y their ability to gain the support necessary to carry out their plans. That means our government must get U.S. troops out of foreign countries, quit telling other nations what to do, and quit killing innocent people in a futile attempt to \"rid the world of evil-doers.\" Let there be no misunderstanding. I'm not blaming A merica. I'm blaming American foreign policy. And I'm not talking about pacifism. I'm talking abo ut protecting you and me and all of America by not provoking war. Nor am I talking about poverty as a cause of terror ism. I'm talking about American foreign policy as a cause of terrorism. The answer lies not in foreign aid for the world's impoverished. Quite the contrary. The answer lies in minding our own business. The answer lies in ending 50 years of foreign polic y failures. Or are we going to let bin Laden win the rest of th e war as well?

Similar ads were published in newspapers. The Libertarian Party responded with a takeoff on t he government's claims. A USA today ad showed America's \"Drug Czar\" John Walters saying , \"This week, I had lunch with the president, testified before Congress and helped fun nel $40 million in illegal drug money to groups like the Taliban.\" The ad said it's the D rug War that enables terrorists to raise large amounts of money."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 313 Last week Drug War advocates tried to refute the Li bertarian ad. Dexter Ingram of the Heritage Foundation wrote: Like it or not, drug-users in America do help finan ce the terrorists who attack us. The sellers rely on volume for their profits; as lo ng as we continue to purchase and use in bulk, they can count on steady and expan ding profits as far as the eye can see. With all due respect to Mr. Ingram (whose intellige nce I have no reason to doubt) and the Heritage Foundation (which sometimes explains free market principles), I think Mr. Ingram has missed the point. Why drug profits are big If a large volume for some product is sufficient to finance terrorism, why don't terrorists raise money by selling computers or aspirin or food ? Well, why don't they? The answer is that those products generate very sma ll profits per sale, while drug profits are astronomical. Whenever the profits in computers, aspirin or food increase, the supply of the item expands – pushing prices and profits back again to levels similar to those of other products. And why are drug profits astronomical? Because drugs are illegal. If drugs were legal – if Smith Kline, Eli Lilly or Bayer could sell drugs – prices would be so low that the profit would be no larger than in c omputers or food. So how could the terrorists make big money in such a business? The black market in drugs When the government interferes with a product in wi de demand – through price controls or outright prohibition – a \"black market\" develops . A black market is a free market existing in defianc e of the government. Because it's illegal, a black market attracts only people willing to defy the government and risk going to prison. Since they're already out side the law, these people generally are quite willing to use violence to keep competitors o ut of their markets. The violence-"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 314 imposed monopolies cause prices and profits to be m uch higher than those in a legal, free market. So the Drug War creates a logical way for terrorist s to raise money. The Drug War also encourages corruption – as some o f the oversized profits subvert policemen, prosecutors and judges who will look the other way. Trying to stamp out a popular product is like tryin g to hold back the tides. And so prohibition inevitably leads to more aggressive law -enforcement – violations of civil liberties, police raids that kill the wrong people, and sentences way out of proportion to the \"crimes\" committed. Thus government interference in drugs leads easily to violence, the killing of innocent people, corruption, tyranny and injustice. That's what happened with alcohol prohibition in th e 1920s. That's what's happening with drug prohibition today. Legal and illegal markets The Drug Warriors try to scare us by pointing to co nditions in today's illegal market and claiming they'd be even worse in a legal market: \"I f you think drugs are a problem now, imagine if they were legal – with pushers on every street corner harassing your children.\" But when drugs were completely legal in America, th ere were no pushers. When people could go to the drugstore and buy Bayer Heroin off the shelf in a safe, measured dosage (for pain relief, as a sedative, or because of an a ddiction), the price was so low that no pusher could succeed selling drugs of unknown origi n on the street. If you haven't studied the history of drugs to be a ware of how much safer (and less-often abused) they were when completely legal, I can unde rstand why you're afraid of relegalizing them. But by now you should be well aware that government uses self-serving propaganda to expand its own power. As the saying goes, \"Truth is the first casualty of war.\" That applies to the War on Drugs and – yes – the War on Terrorism. If you want to end the dangers of drugs, the violen ce, corruption, tyranny and injustice, we have to end the insane War on Drugs.

The Myths of World War II by Harry Browne March 25, 2002 A number of people have complained about my stand o n the current War on Terrorism by citing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These events are recounted as evidence that sometimes the U.S. is attacked without justification and that som etimes innocent people must be killed for a greater good. Here is my reply to one such le tter. Dear Mr. —— : Thank you for writing with your concerns. "},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 316 The \"Unprovoked Attack\" \"The U.S. was minding its own business prior to Dec ember 7, 1941 but, we were still attacked by Japan.\" Unfortunately, the U.S. (meaning Franklin Roosevelt ) was not minding its own business. FDR browbeat the Japanese for a year before Pearl H arbor (1941). He cut off all exports to Japan, froze Japanese assets in the U.S., and de manded that the Japanese get out of Manchuria. The U.S., Britain, and the Netherlands had already agreed that all three nations would go to war against Japan if the Japanese entered Thaila nd — which they did a week before Pearl Harbor. So the U.S. was already committed to war (without the knowledge of Congress or the American people) a week before Pear l Harbor. As Secretary of War Stimson reported in his diaries , FDR then told his cabinet that they had to figure out how to get the Japanese to fire t he first shot. Fortunately for them, the Japanese had already decided to bomb Pearl Harbor i f the U.S. didn't back down from its bullying. I don't call Roosevelt's actions to be the U.S. min ding its own business. The Atomic Bomb \"The Japanese did not surrender until two nuclear b ombs were detonated on their soil.\" That also is not the case. The Japanese had sued fo r surrender several times during the year before Hiroshima. The Japanese asked for only one condition — that the Emperor be allowed to remain in place. The U.S. refused because FDR had coined the ridicul ous phrase \"unconditional surrender\" and was determined to stick to it. When the Japanese eventually surrendered without condition, the U.S. allowed the Emperor to remain in place anyway. "},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 317 Almost every leading U.S. general and admiral was a ppalled by Truman's dropping of the atomic bomb — especially on two cities with no mili tary significance whatsoever. You can read some of their comments here: http://www.do ug-long.com/quotes.htm If terrorism is the act of killing innocent people to pressure a government to change its policies, what was the killing of over 100,000 inno cent people — supposedly to end a war, but a war that could have been ended months be fore? Foreign Policy Is Simply Politics How many Japanese and Americans died unnecessarily because of a megalomaniac in the White House — who was conducting an aggressive fore ign policy from 1939 onward without the knowledge of Congress or the American p eople? Only when all his cabinet officers wrote their memo irs after the war did most of this become known — and by then practically no one was i nterested in revisiting the causes of the war. The same thing is happening today. The country is a ccepting the president's version of events without question. What he's doing makes no s ense. But he has his own Pearl Harbor and so, like FDR, he's unstoppable. Appeasement? \"I don't think talking or appeasing the terrorists will do anything but embolden them.\" I have no interest in appeasing anyone. I simply wa nt the U.S. to stop bullying the world and creating enemies. How Soon We Forget \"I will concede that we (the U.S.) stick our noses where it does not belong sometimes but like the Japanese, the terrorists hav e brought the fight to U.S. and it is time we showed them and the world wh at happens when you mess with the best.\" I don't understand why so many Libertarians underst ood before September 11 how dangerous it was for the U.S. to be meddling in oth er people's affairs — but now suddenly it's as though there's absolutely no conne ction between a dangerous foreign policy and an aggressive act against the U.S. "},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 318 And if foreign-policy meddling contributed to the e vents of September 11, what do you think is going to happen to us as a result of what President Bush is doing now?

I want only to speak the truth so that, as events u nfold, I hope that more and more people will come to realize what a terrible mistake is bei ng made. I appreciate your concerns. Few people have the fai ntest idea what went on in World War II or what went on before September 11.

A Solution for the Middle East By Harry Browne April 11, 2002 George Bush wants Ariel Sharon to stop doing what G eorge Bush has been doing for the past six months – using force to crush his enemies. Doesn't Bush realize that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery? His petulance at Sharon for not following Bush's or ders indicates that Mr. Bush now believes he's President of the World – and everyone is expected to obey his commands."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 319 He does have good reason to be surprised at Sharon' s disobedience, however. After all, your tax money has successfully bribed the leaders of Pakistan, the Philippines and other countries into changing their policies. Why hasn't it bought Israel's obedience as well? What America should do Does America have a duty to help Israel? Of course not. Our Constitution authorizes our gove rnment only to defend America – not the rest of the world or any part of it. But if America is determined to help Israel, the fi rst step should be to stop arming Israel's enemies. Your money has gone to the dictators of Sa udi Arabia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan and other Arab count ries. Should we be surprised that some of that money was used to buy military power t o attack Israel? Should we be surprised that some of the money is funding Arafat? After making Israel's enemies so powerful, our lead ers have the perfect excuse to run to Israel's aid. But this is nothing new. The same routine is used b y our government at home – causing problems and then running to the rescue in educatio n, health care, charity, farming, business and most other areas of society. Governmen t is good at one thing: It knows how to break your legs, hand you a crutch, and say, \"Se e, if it weren't for the government, you wouldn't be able to walk.\" The great mediator Now Colin Powell is supposed to negotiate a Middle- East peace – in the great tradition of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, who brought peace to the Middle East so many times. Tell me something: If you and I had a business rela tionship and disagreed about the meaning of our contract, would you want Colin Powel l, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter or even George Bush to mediate the dispute? I doubt it. We'd look for someone who's a professio nal mediator – someone with a record of helping people arrive at lasting settlements. Wh y would anyone want George Bush or Colin Powell to mediate? The answer is simple: Make an agreement dictated by the U.S. government and you get a big hunk of money from the U.S. taxpayers. You don' t have to abide by the agreement; just pose for a photo-op with Colin Powell or Georg e Bush and the money is yours."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 320 In most mediations, the parties involved pay the me diator. Only with American foreign policy does the mediator pay the parties. The solution The Middle Eastern crisis was born in turmoil at th e end of World War II, as the Great Powers imposed by force a \"solution\" that told peop le where they should live. Such a situation is bound to remain a setting for violence and hatred – for resentments that will last hundreds of years. How could we expect it to b e otherwise? And yet, there actually is a solution possible – on e that would allow Israelis and Palestinians access to their holy sites, one that w ould end disputes over territory, one that would permit all sides to live in peace without fea r of each other. The answer is to create a new nation in the area no w comprising Israel and west Jordan. Name it anything you want. But make sure that its government is constitutional ly limited to little more than the defense of the nation. Allow people to buy any prop erty that's for sale. Allow people the freedom to worship in whatever way they want. Make sure the holy sites are operated by churches, rather than government agencies, so they' re open to everyone. In other words, make sure that no group can impose its way by force on any other group. No one living in such a country would be deprived o f anything he's willing to earn, and no one would have anything to fear from others. Is such a solution too idealistic? Well, it worked for nearly a century in America. Too bad our ancestors discarded it. If they hadn't, it migh t be more obvious to people in the Middle East that this is the solution they need. Unfortunately, there's no chance that anyone with a ny authority – Israeli, Palestinian or American – would agree to this solution. It takes a ll the power away from the leaders. And since our politicians have no regard for consti tutional limits, we can't expect them to suggest such a solution to others.

Of course not. \"America\" stands for peace and frien dship, and was once the beacon of liberty – providing light and hope and inspiration to the entire world. But over the past century, its politicians have run amok – ignoring all constitutional limits, dictating to U.S. citizens how they must li ve their lives, pretending to be the world's policemen, and telling foreigners who must run their governments. Not surprisingly, the politicians do a horrendous j ob with everything they attempt – not just foreign policy.

I t also demonstrated that when you give other people a reason to hate you, it is the m ost brutal elements of their society who will take the lead in retaliating.

It requires only two essential elements. The first is the ability to repel foreign missiles. Ronald Reagan proposed such a missile defense in 19 83. But he gave the job to the Defense Department, a bureaucratic government agenc y, and 19 years later we're not one step closer to the protection we need. The government should simply post a reward – say, $ 25 billion – to be given to the first private company that produces an actual functioning , fool-proof missile defense. Not a prototype, not a plan, not a cost-plus contract – b ut a demonstration of the actual system bringing down missiles. If such an offer were made, we'd probably have a missile defense within five years. Remember all the reasons given in 1997 that the Y2K computer problem couldn't possibly be solved by 2000? Even computer experts s aid there wasn't enough time, there weren't enough programmers, and there were too many lines of computer code to be examined, altered and tested. But somehow, people i n search of profits found ways to overcome all the barriers that stymie bureaucrats, and they reduced the problem to a minor inconvenience.

The second essential element is to get the U.S. gov ernment out of the affairs of other nations. No more troops stationed in other countrie s. No more foreign aid – military or financial – to other governments. No more demanding that foreign countries change their ways. If you want to be the world's policeman, telling ev eryone else how to run their lives, expect to be hated – and even attacked. But if we restore America to the peaceful beacon of liberty that once provided light and hope and inspiration to the entire world, we can ex pect to be loved again – as America once was.

The Inevitable Next Step"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 331 Now the federal government has taken the next logic al step — the one that proceeds inexorably from all that it has done up to now. The government's Citizen Corps program has set up O peration TIPS (Terrorism Information & Prevention System). At its website, c omplete with a smiling picture of Big Brother, you can read: Operation TIPS will be a national system for report ing suspicious, and potentially terrorist-related activity. The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of the ir work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious a ctivity in public places. It's about time, right? We've been pussy-footing ar ound with these terrorists for too long, right? So far the Feds have recruited over a million peopl e to snoop for them — mail carriers, cable TV installers and repairmen, telephone servic emen, trash men, and other people who might be around your home during the course of their work. While doing their normal jobs, they'll look for anything suspicious i n your home — and they'll report to the government anything they think is strange. So anyone coming into your home might be a Federal snoop. Even that neighbor who doesn't like you may be a government informant. But so what? You have nothing to hide, right? When the cable TV man comes to your house and sees those strange books on your shelf, or the catalog from a gun maker in the trash (a cat alog you didn't ask for, but was sent to you because your name was bought from someone you d eal with), or the unusual amount of electronic equipment you have, he has the opport unity to be a hero and report you to the secret police. He might even get a Gold Star. O r make that a Red Star. But so what? Even if secret agents come to question you, you're innocent, right? You have nothing to hide. You can tell the secret polic e they've got the wrong man. You can explain later to the neighbors that those p olicemen and strange-looking agents were at your home by mistake, right? Incarceration for the Greater Good Of course, the thought police might not accept your explanations. And they probably won't let you call an attorney. But you don't need an attorney if you're innocent, right?"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 332 And even if they arrested you when you were by your self and your family doesn't know where you are, your spouse and children won't worry unnecessarily about you.

And it's true that the anti-terrorism experts need to make a lot of arrests, in order to show they're doing something and to justify expanding th eir budgets. After all, they are government bureaucrats — just like the ones who are wiping out drugs, poverty, and illiteracy. But they're doing important work — and so you shouldn't complain if you're inconvenienced, right? They may even torture you to get information you do n't have. But, hey, it's better to torture ten innocent people than to let one guilty person conceal the plans for the next terrorist attack, right? The America That Was When we had a Bill of Rights in America, it assured you of a right to have an attorney present, a right to confront your accusers, a right to know the charge against you, a right to reasonable bail, a right to a public and speedy trial before a jury of your peers. But that was before America was attacked in an unpr ovoked and vicious act. And so now we must all be willing to sacrifice — and accept wh atever the government thinks best. You said that yourself, right? And the TIPS program may give you the honor to be one of the first Americans to sacrifice. Since you may be detained in secret, because you mi ght not be allowed to see an attorney, because you might not have a public trial , and because you'll be dealing with human beings who are far from perfect, it's even po ssible that you could be tried and executed in secret. But so what? Your death will just be part of the co llateral damage that's a necessary element in this important War on Terrorism.

It may be the most misunderstood of all American wa rs. And so much of what we lament today — government intrusions on civil liberties, u nlimited taxation, corporate welfare, disregarding of the Constitution, funny money — dat e back to programs started during the Civil War. Although slavery was an ever-present political issu e in the early 1800s, it wasn't the immediate cause of the war. In fact, Abraham Lincol n in his first inaugural address vowed that he wouldn't interfere with slavery. He also said the North wouldn't invade the South un less necessary to collect taxes."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 334 Before the war, the main concern about slavery was whether new states and territories would come into the Union as free states or slave s tates. This affected the balance of power in Congress, and both Northerners and Souther ners worried that the other region might dominate Congress. Taxes Why then was the Civil War fought? As with most wars, there's no single answer. But th e predominant cause was taxation. Before his election, Lincoln had promoted very high tariffs (federal taxes on foreign imports), using the receipts to build railroads, ca nals, roads, and other federal pork-barrel projects. The tariffs protected Northern manufacturers from f oreign competition, and were paid mostly by the non-manufacturing South, while most o f the proposed boondoggles were to be built in the North. Thus the South was being for ced to subsidize Northern corporate welfare. Certainly the Southerners were concerned about the future of slavery. But there was no threat in 1861 that the federal government would be able to outlaw it. Secession When Lincoln was elected, South Carolina saw a grim future ahead and seceded. Other Southern states quickly followed suit. Lincoln asserted that no state had a right to seced e from the Union — even though several geographical regions had considered secessi on before. Few people thought the Union couldn't survive if some states decided to le ave. Upon seceding, the Confederates took over all feder al forts and other facilities in the South, with no opposition from Lincoln. The last re maining federal facilities were Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter in South Carolin a. Lincoln at first promised to let the South have Fort Sumter, but then tried to reinforce it. The South moved to confiscate it — shelling the Fort for many hours. (No one was kil led or even seriously injured.) Why was Fort Sumter important? Because it guarded a major tariff-collecting facility in the harbor at Charleston. So long as the Union cont rolled it, the South would still have to pay Lincoln's oppressive tariffs. "},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 335 Although there had been only scattered Northern opp osition to the secessions, the shelling of Fort Sumter (like the bombing of Pearl Harbor almost a century later) incited many Northerners to call for war against the South. The South's seizure of Fort Sumter caused many Northerners to notice that the South wo uld no longer be subsidizing Northern manufacturing. As the war began, the sole issue was restoration of the Union — not ending slavery. Only in 1863 did the Emancipation Proclamation go into e ffect, and it didn't actually free a single slave — just like so many laws today that do n't perform the purpose for which they were promoted. The Damage The Lincoln Presidency imposed a police state upon America — North and South. He shut down newspapers that disagreed with him, suspe nded habeas corpus, imprisoned civilians without trials, and went to war — all wit hout Congressional authority. Just as future Presidents would do, he used the war as an excuse to increase government dramatically. He rewarded his political friends wit h pork-barrel projects, flooded the country with paper money, established a national ba nking system to finance a large federal debt, and imposed the first income tax. He also destroyed the balance between the executive and Congressional branches, and between t he federal government and the states. He set in motion many precedents we suffer from tod ay. That's why it's important to understand the Civil War for what it was, not what the myth makers want it to be. Alternatives Was slavery an evil? Of course. Is it a blessing that it ended? Of course. Was it necessary for 140,414 people to die in order to end slavery? Definitely not. The U.S. was the only western country that ended slaver y through violence — outside of Haiti (where it ended through a slave revolt). During the 19th century dozens of nations ended slavery peaceably. What Was Lincoln? "},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 336 Was Lincoln opposed to slavery? Yes, he became an a bolitionist in the mid-1850s, although he said he didn't know how slavery could b e ended. Lincoln's fans have portrayed him as the Great Eman cipator, Honest Abe, who with great courage and single-minded determination fought a Ci vil War to free the slaves. Many of his detractors have tried to show that he was actua lly a racist. I think it's important to understand that, more tha n anything else, he was a politician. Throughout his career he shaded the truth for polit ical advantage, he played both sides against the middle, he lied about his opponents, an d he used government force to get what he wanted. Like so many politicians, he contin ually uttered platitudes about liberty while doing everything in his power to curtail it. His idolaters applaud him for being a dictatorial p olitician, saying this was precisely what America needed in 1861. No historian believes he ac ted within the Constitution. Importance of Studying the Civil War I believe the study of the origins and conduct of t he Civil War is an important part of a libertarian education. Although the Progressive era, the New Deal, and the Great Society each caused government growth to accelerate, only the Civil War caused a complete break with the past. It transformed a federation of states into a national government. It introduced the elements of big government that later movements wou ld build on. And it set in motion the disregard for the Constitution that's taken for granted today. You'll also find parallels between the Civil War an d today's War on Terrorism. Lincoln and the Civil War are fascinating subjects. I've read numerous books about them, and I can highly recommend two recent books that pr ovide an excellent introduction. Jeffrey Hummel's book \"Emancipating Slaves, Enslavi ng Free\" (published in 1996) and Thomas DiLorenzo's \"The Real Lincoln\" (2002) are bo th well-documented and very well-written. You'll find reading either of them (o r both) to be an adventure, rather than a task. Hummel's book is longer, more complete, and perhaps more balanced. DiLorenzo's is faster reading. Both are well worth their inexpensi ve prices.

How to destroy America in one easy lesson by Harry Browne  August 15, 2002 President Bush now seems hell-bent on a plan that c ould easily lead to a nuclear strike against America – a strike that could cause a disas ter many times worse than the World Trade Center attack. Over and over Mr. Bush has said he'll do whatever i s necessary to remove Saddam Hussein from Iraq. (\"I've made up my mind that Sadd am needs to go.\") Until recently, that meant an invasion of Iraq – with the only ques tion being when, not if. Lately, as more and more people have spoken out aga inst such an invasion, he's said he's considering several possibilities. But don't be sur prised when some \"incident\" provides an excuse to launch a full-scale strike against Iraq. American leaders have always found ways to provoke incidents – from Fort Sumter to the Gulf of Tonkin – that draw America into wars. No reason for an invasion has made any sense.

What a bout Saudi Arabia – a nation that's been far more helpful to America's enemies? • Because Saddam Hussein is a madman? How can a madma n stay in power for 23 years and earn the respect of his fellow Arab leade rs, who refuse to support a war against him? • Because \"Saddam Hussein has gassed his own people\" – that argument-clinching, can't-answer-that-can-you, case-closed game-winner?

Somehow the threat to the Ameri can way and everything we hold dear will finally be over. Playing loose with America's future If we live that long. There's a terrible problem in that scenario. It's really unlikely that Hussein has \"weapons of m ass destruction.\" So he's not actually much of a threat to anyone. But let's just suppose George Bush is right (for on ce). Let's assume Hussein does have the ability to nuke the United States of America. It wo uld be suicidal for him to use those weapons against us. He knows he can't defeat America. So using nuclear or biological weapons against us would give George Bush the perfect excuse to drop n uclear bombs on Baghdad – and anywhere else Hussein might try to hide. By using a nuclear weapon against America, Hussein would be signing his own death warrant. There's only one circumstance in which he'd have re ason to do so. If America invaded Iraq, he'd know his days would be numbered. He coul dn't possibly drive the Americans out of Iraq. They would capture and kill him. And if he's going to die anyway, why not use the mo st terrible weapons he has to cause as much destruction to his enemies as possible before he dies? So the one situation in which Hussein would use wea pons of mass destruction against us would be if George Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq . If Mr. Bush doesn't realize this, he's a fool. If h e does realize it, he's acting with reckless disregard for the safety of the American people and he should be prosecuted.

That isn’t true , but here's a laundry list of \"Do’s and Don't’s\" regarding the war. (And please note that i t doesn't include being nice to the terrorists.) What to do: • Repeal the regulations that prohibit guns on planes – and that mandate metal detectors and security searches at airports. Before those measures were introduced in 1973, there were no reported cases of passengers shooting each other by accident or in arguments. There were a few hijackin gs using guns, but far fewer passengers actually died than have been killed sinc e introducing the security measures. • Recognize that 9-11 was a trillion-to-one shot that couldn't be duplicated in a million years. So don't turn America upside-down, c ausing billions of dollars in losses to companies and business travelers to preve nt the repetition of something that most likely won't happen again anyway. • Find Osama bin Laden, capture him, and try him in A merica. He must have a fair trial – consistent with the rules of evidence and t he Bill of Rights. If he's killed without a trial, he'll become a martyr throughout t he Muslim world – creating"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 341 hundreds of millions more anti-Americans who will s upport future acts of terrorism. If he isn't really behind the 9-11 attac ks, killing him without a fair trial terminates the hunt for the real criminal – leaving us in danger. So prosecute anyone who shoots him on sight. • Declare an end to the so-called War on Terrorism. C all it a victory, a defeat, or an armistice. But quit acting as though it's an excuse to invade any country or take away our civil liberties. For the future: These long-term measures should be taken: • Bring all American troops home. They're a principal cause of the anti-American feeling that provides financial support, networking , and manpower for thugs who wouldn't be much of a threat otherwise. How would y ou feel if Chinese troops were stationed in your city? • Stop telling other countries who their leaders shou ld be or what their foreign policy must be. President Bush can buy off foreign leaders with your tax money, but he can't buy the friendship of the people in th ose countries – people who suffer because of misguided policies forced on them by arr ogant American know-it-alls. How would you feel if the Russians issued ultimatum s regarding how our country must be run? • End all foreign aid – military and economic. It has ruined countries, provided resources to our enemies, and turned hundreds of mi llions of people against America. • Stop choosing sides in foreign political battles. T hey're none of our business, and our meddling usually comes back to haunt us. (Remem ber, our government supported Iraq in its war against Iran.) • Recognize that foreigners don't care whether or not you're \"free.\" They do care whether or not our government is interfering in the ir country. What not to do: And here's a list of things we definitely should no t do: • Don't set up military tribunals that operate withou t the Anglo-Saxon rules of evidence. That's a sure way to convict the wrong pe ople and allow the real criminals to continue hurting us."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 342 • Don't imprison people without trial, without a lawy er to defend them, and without access to their families and the press. What's the point of \"defending America\" if we throw away American principles? • Don't invade Iraq. That's probably the only way to motivate Saddam Hussein to attack us with whatever dangerous weapons he might have. So long as we leave him alone, he won't commit the suicidal act of prov oking the U.S. to drop nuclear bombs on him. • Don't disrespect the sovereignty of foreign countri es when chasing Osama Bin Laden. How would you like foreign police or militar y to run around your city chasing people they think are criminals? • Don't assume that your government tells you the gos pel truth – or that it will succeed in anything it does. Don't forget that thes e same politicians told you they were running budget surpluses while they were hidin g deficits by stealing from Social Security. And these are the same Keystone Ko ps who have promised for decades to stamp out drugs, poverty, crime and sin. How well have they succeeded? • Don't let politicians use the so-called War on Terr orism as an excuse to take away our remaining freedoms. Apology I'm sorry that I can't snap my fingers and undo 50 years of bad American foreign policy. Unfortunately, by continuing to tell the rest of th e world what to do, President Bush is making a bad situation even worse. So here's a final don't: Don't lose your self-respect. It isn't necessary fo r you to speak out against the war, but don't embarrass yourself by joining in patriotic di splays that are nothing but sound and fury.

In fact, Hussein is actually a secular nationalist and socialist – and an enemy of the kind of religious fundamentalism represented by al-Qaida . Whatever ogre Saddam Hussein might be, he has nothing to do with the so-called W ar on Terrorism. And to call Hussein's support for Palestine an excu se for attacking innocent people in Iraq is to say that the U.S. should bomb every Musl im country – including Pakistan, whose dictator has George Bush's full support.

An Anniversary Worth Celebrating by Harry Browne October 24, 2002 This Monday, October 28th, should be a national hol iday. In addition to being my wife's birthday, it is the anniversary of the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in 1886. As with most parts of American history, very few Am ericans are aware of the Statue's background. It was a gift from the French people to the America n people. And when I say, \"French people,\" I mean it. It wasn't paid for with French taxes; the money was raised through voluntary donations, given freely by French people as a token of friendship to the United States. Why would they do that? Because at that time the United States was truly un ique. It was the one country in the world where individual liberty was prized far above \"national greatness.\" And it was the one major country that didn't embroil itself in the endless wars the European people were so used to. How Times Change In the 1880s, people all over the world looked to A merica for inspiration. Its very existence was proof that it was possible to have a relatively free and peaceful country. No income tax, no foreign wars, no welfare state, no i ntrusions on civil liberties."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 353 Of course, that's no longer the case. We now have a ll those things — and more. And, worse yet, most Americans have come to accept them as necessary evils. Government schools make no attempt to show children that it wa sn't always this way — that it doesn't have to be this way. Liberty Alone When the Statue arrived in the U.S., Americans dona ted the money — again, voluntarily — to build the pedestal and assemble the Statue on Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor. The great monument isn't called the Statue of the W orld's Superpower, or the Statue of National Greatness, or the Statue of the World's Po liceman. Because individual liberty was America's one possession so prized by others, t he monument was named the Statue of Liberty. It is an impressive sight. Notice that Lady Liberty faces outward — toward the world, not toward America. With her torch held high, she is re aching out to the world as the symbol of liberty — bringing light and inspiration to peop le everywhere. The Statue's Message At the time of her creation, she was saying: Whoever you are, wherever you are, if you can just get to America, you can be free. No matter what your station where you are now, you'll be equal before the law here. No one will ask for your papers. No one will fasten a number on you. No one will extort a percentage of your income as t he price of earning a living. You'll be free to pursue the life you've always dre amed of.

'If you aren't guilty, what are you afraid of?' by Harry Browne November 28, 2002 The Homeland Security bill is now law – following i n the footsteps of all the new government intrusions of the past 14 months. And as concerns are raised about the new powers of the government, we continue to hear the f amiliar refrain, \"If you aren't guilty, you have nothing to fear. These restrictions are ne cessary to catch terrorists, but they won't hurt innocent people.\" Sure. The well-known phrase, \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help you,\" could easily be reworded to read, \"I'm from Congress and this pr ogram will turn out exactly as we promise it will.\" Government has failed to educate our children prope rly, it has made a mess of our health- care system, it can't balance its budget, it can't keep its spending in line, it can't keep drugs out of its own prisons – but we're assured th at it will run a squeaky-clean homeland security program. It's bad enough that government wastes so much of o ur money, but it's even worse that almost anyone could wind up in prison – even someon e who has committed no act of violence against anyone else. Look at the hundreds of thousands of pot-smokers who took seriously the statement that \"a woman [or man] has a right to control his own body.\" The guilty and the innocent Why should we think the so-called War on Terrorism will be conducted with more regard for individual rights than anything the government has done up to now?"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 355 And yet, no matter how bad the government's record, whenever Congress passes a new piece of draconian legislation, we're assured that only the guilty will be hurt by these laws. If only that were so. The truth is that innocence i s no protection against government agencies that have the power to do what they think best – or against a government agent hoping for promotion and willing do whatever he has to do in order to get it. In fact, it is almost always the innocent – not the guilty – who suffer most from government's intrusions. • Tell the most unprejudiced businessman he has nothi ng to fear from the piles of forms he must file to prove he doesn't discriminate . • Tell a homeowner he has nothing to fear when his pr operty is seized by the government in a mistaken – or contrived – drug raid . • Tell a taxpayer he has nothing to fear when the IRS drags him into a \"taxpayer compliance\" audit that eats up a week of his life, costs him thousands of dollars in accounting fees, and threatens him with unbearable penalties. Being innocent doesn't allow you to ignore the gove rnment's demands for reports – or to say \"No, thanks\" when a government agent wants to s earch your records, your place of business, or your home – or to refuse to observe re gulations that were aimed at the guilty, not you. How laws go wrong How many times have we seen the following pattern? The press and politicians demand that something be done about violent crime, terrorist acts, drug dealing, gun deaths, tax evasi on, or whatever is the Urgent Concern Of The Month. A tough new take-no-prisoners law or policy is put into place. The guilty make it their business to understand wha tever new policy might affect them – and they take steps to sidestep the inspecti ons and background checks, and to keep their property out of reach of asset forfei ture laws. The innocent know little about such laws – having been told they have nothing to fear – and are surprised and helpless when some zealous law-enforc ement agency, looking to pad its arrest and prosecution records, moves in on them."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 356 After the dust settles, the initial \"problem\" conti nues unabated, because the guilty have slipped through the net. But the innocent are left burdened with new chores, expenses, and dangers.

When government force is used to solve social probl ems, we all suffer and nothing good is ever achieved. But coercion is wondrously effect ive at harming the innocent. All our lives are diminished. Even worse, every year, a few million innocent peop le suffer special burdens – greater than those the government places on all of us. The dismantling of the Bill of Rights allows the government to disrupt their lives, confi scate their property, or even kill them – even though they've committed no crimes.

Even critics of the Vietnam War or the so-called War on Terrorism feel obliged to say that World War II was necessary. And that war provided a justification for all sorts of military adventures afterward. In fact, whenever I write that Americans shouldn't be bombing Iraq or Serbia or Afghanistan or some other hapless Third World country, I get e- mails from critics saying such things as: • \"You would have turned the other cheek after Pearl Harbor.\" • \"Munich showed you have to stop a dictator before h e's too strong to resist.\" • \"If you'd been in charge in the 1940s, we'd all be speaking Japanese or German today.\" World War II has always been of great interest to m e. I've known for decades that it was just one more war the politicians suckered us into. But I still learned a great deal from reading Richard Maybury's new book \"World War II: T he Rest of the Story.\" Maybury provides no startling new evidence. But he sifts through the known facts – which nearly all historians agree on – and assemble s the evidence to show irrefutably that: "},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 358 • The U.S. could had stayed out of the war, because H itler had no chance of conquering England – let alone America. (His doom w as sealed the moment his troops invaded Russia in August 1941.) • The Pearl Harbor attack was neither a surprise nor \"unprovoked.\" (The Japanese code had been broken 16 months before, and Roosevel t had bullied the Japanese in order to provoke a war. On Nov. 26, 1941, Secret ary of War Stimson wrote in his diary, \"The question was how we should maneuver them into firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves. \") • There was no military reason to drop atomic bombs o n Japan. They were used as terrorist weapons – killing innocent people to infl uence other people. (Japan was already offering to surrender, their homeland was b lockaded, and the Japanese couldn't have survived six months even without an i nvasion.) There's much more, of course. But the main point is that America should never have intervened in the age-old quarrels of Europe and As ia. If our politicians had minded their own business, 292,131 Americans wouldn't have died – died thinking they were defending American freedoms, but actually sacrifici ng for the benefit of politicians. The Roosevelt myth Why did America get in the war? Because Franklin Roosevelt thought it was to his pe rsonal advantage. In 1939, most people considered the New Deal to be an abject failure. The unemployment rate was still at 17 percent, with no end in sight to the Depression. Roosevelt still managed to be re-elected in 1940 be cause he had great personal charisma, and because he was running against a typical me-too Republican, Wendell Wilkie – a man with no solution for the economic crisis. Roose velt insisted he would keep America neutral, proclaiming \"I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\" But in reality, Roosevelt saw getting into the war as a way to redeem his reputation and join the ranks of the \"great\" presidents – wartime leaders like Washington, Lincoln and Wilson.

He ties what happened in World War II to what is ha ppening today in the so-called War on Terrorism. In fact, he shows that today's crises are simply an extension of one century- long war. Reading this book may help you see the world as a l ogical place again. It answers a question that might concern any lover of liberty: W hy did a nation devoted to freedom and small government – blessed by being isolated fr om the age-old turmoils of the Old World – cross two oceans, sacrifice a quarter-milli on Americans, and become embroiled in everyone else's affairs? The answer: It was done to satisfy the personal amb itions of politicians – not to save America from tyranny. It's too much to expect tens of millions of America ns to understand that our wars are just a political racket – not when their historical know ledge consists of the one-liners fed to them in government schools.

Of course not. Our attention is directed to Iraq – even though there's no public evidence that Iraq has anything to do with al-Qaida – and a lot of evidence that they're enemies of each other. Suddenly, Osama bin Laden is no longer important. This doesn't make sense if you think the object is to end terrorism.

But, as Tim O'Brien has pointed out, while it's pos sible to have both liberty and security, you can't have an empire as well.

For example, amateur historians remind us impatient ly that the reason Iraq must disarm (which no one else is doing) is that Hussein promis ed to disarm at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Of course, they neglect to tell us that the \"promis e\" was made at the point of a gun. You don't \"freely\" give your money to a mugger when he says, \"Your money or your life.\" Promises and actions that are coerced are morally m eaningless. But citing Hussein's promise isn't the only way his tory is misused. History is invoked to justify the U.S. starting a w ar against a foreign country (Iraq in 1991, Serbia in 1999, and now Iraq again) because \" history tells us\" we have to stop the latest incarnation of Adolf Hitler before he procee ds to conquer the entire world.

And amateu r historians apparently have never bothered to go beyond their high-school history les sons to discover what made it possible"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 365 for Hitler to threaten Europe in 1938. And the back ground throws a completely different light on the relevance of 1938 to today. In 1914 Austria dominated Europe the way the U.S. d ominates the world today. The Austrian Empire included what is now Hungary, the C zech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia, as well as parts of Italy and Romania. Many Serbs thought Bosnia should be part of Serbia instead of Austria. When the Austrian Emperor's heir apparent, Archduke Ferdinan d, visited Bosnia, he was murdered by a Bosnian Serb protesting Austrian domination. This act sucked almost all the countries of Europe into the bloody first World War. Austria declared war on Serbia. And because of mutu al defense treaties, Britain, France, Belgium, Romania, Greece, Portugal, Montenegro, Rus sia, and even Japan went to war on behalf of Serbia. On the other side, Germany, It aly, Bulgaria, and Turkey supported Austria. Eventually, 15 million soldiers and civilians would be killed and at least 20 million wounded, all because one person had been murdered — a fitting testament to the irrationality of war. Stalemate The war probably could have ended in 1917. Both sid es were devastated and seeking an armistice. But America, under no threat of attack b y the Germans or Austrians, entered the war that year — allowing the Allies to step up the war and forcing Germany to surrender in 1918. The Allies imposed oppressive terms on the Germans — who, by a complicated argument, were blamed for the entire war. Important parts of Germany were confiscated and given to Czechoslovakia, Poland, and France. Ge rmany was stripped of its colonies. And the Allies forced the Germans to assume the cos t of the entire war — a price they could never hope to pay. To the victors go the spoils, indeed! Enter Hitler All that most Americans know of 1920s Germany is th e decadence they've seen in Cabaret and other movies. But here was an intellectual cou ntry devastated by losing the resources to support itself, made to pay horrendous reparations, and suffering from a runaway inflation that caused a loaf of bread to co st billions of marks."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 366 If we realize what the Germans were forced to go th rough, we can begin to understand how one of the most culturally advanced countries o f the world — the home of Goethe, Schiller, Beethoven, and Wagner — could have fallen for a thug like Hitler. Hitler would have been laughed out of Germany in 19 10. But in 1933 he seemed to be the only person able to end the reparations, recapture the stolen territory, reunite families, and restore Germany's glory. The Germans could see he was a brutal man, but they were told you can't make an omelet without breaking a fe w eggs. (Unfortunately, everyone assumes it will be someone else's eggs that will be broken, and no one notices that the omelet never materializes.) Conclusions So perhaps those who love to recite historical slog ans could give some thought to a few lessons from history that are relevant to today's s ituation and could help us understand something about our own future . . . If U.S. politicians had minded their own business i n 1917, instead of plunging America into a war that didn't threaten us, an armi stice would have occurred, and the existing governments in Russia and Germany most likely would have remained in power — meaning no Soviet Union and no Hitler. But do-gooders always believe they know what's best for the world — and they claim that some simple act of force will settle matters once and fo r all. It never does. If the U.S. had stayed out of World War I, most lik ely there would have been no World War II, although it's entirely possible that other wars — more localized — would have occurred. World War II was the direct re sult of World War I — and, more specifically, of the U.S. interfering in World War I. If the Allies hadn't imposed draconian peace terms on Germany in 1918, there probably would have been no Hitler to threaten anyo ne. Germany would have resumed its role as an intellectual and cultural ce nter in Europe. (American diplomats learned their lesson and eased their dema nds somewhat at the end of World War II.) The Allies forced the Germans to promise things tha t could never be delivered. And using force to exact promises from someone like Saddam Hussein creates about as much security as ordering your cat to guar d your home.

Are they aware of the oil disp utes, the fact that Kuwait has more in common with Iraq proper than the northern Iraqi Kur ds do, or that Kuwait not too long ago was prepared to become part of Iraq? Are they a ware that the American ambassador to Iraq gave her blessing to an Iraqi invasion of K uwait just a few days before it occurred? Nor have we touched on another important part of hi story — the assertions made by our government before and during the Gulf War, assertio ns that later proved to be false. There were no Iraqi troops massed on the Saudi bord er, no Iraqi atrocities in Kuwaiti hospitals. The “smart-bombs” General Schwarzkopf ta lked about so proudly in his TV briefings were hardly ever used in the war — and wh en they were used, they missed their targets more often than not. And the number of inno cent Iraqi civilians was revised upward several times after the war. Of course, all that is ancient history. So why dred ge it up today? Because the men who told the lies in 1991 — Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Colin Powell — are the same men providing the \"evid ence\" that we must go to war again.

Because we're Americans, we don't live in a police state, as so many billions of people in the world do. Of course, our own government has made it clear tha t it can — and will — monitor our emails, tap our phones, dig into our bank accounts, and imprison us indefinitely without trial or even access to an attorney. But then, unli ke the police states, our government does these things only for good purposes — never to hide its mistakes, to intimidate dissenters, or to force us to trust its good intentions — as ha ppens in police states. Because we are Americans, we have a free press — no t the controlled press that exists in Iraq and other despotic countries. Of course, our President holds scripted news confer ences — during which the questions and questioners have been chosen in advance. But th at's merely because he has a penchant for organization, not to control what the press reports — the way it's done in despotic countries. It's true that over the past year we've been subjec ted to an unrelenting drumbeat of accusations against Saddam Hussein — all emanating from our government. This has been picked up by the press.

(I wonder how they got that idea.) I guess it's no surprise that a majorit y supports the President's desire to attack a country that hasn't attacked us — or even threatene d to do so. But, unlike in Iraq, this propaganda has been disse minated as a replacement for the presentation of evidence that the President feels i s too sensitive for us to see. So, unlike in Iraq, government brain-washing is done for our own security. What I Want If you'll forgive my feeble attempts at irony, I ho pe you'll at least see my point: in the guise of supposedly protecting our freedom, our gov ernment has already confiscated far too much of it. \"But what would you do about Iraq? Would you trust a known liar like Saddam Hussein? How would you get Hussein to disarm?\" I wouldn't even try — anymore than I'd try to disar m Israel or China or Pakistan or India or Korea. Not one of those countries, including Ira q, has tried to attack us. America’s entry into World War I \"to make the world safe for democracy\" caused the war to last an extra year, allowed the communists t o come to power in Russia, allowed Adolf Hitler to come to power in Germany, and laid the groundwork for World War II. Our government's attempts to fight communism or spr ead democracy around the world have caused millions of innocent people to die in I ran, Indonesia, Iraq, Panama, Guatemala, Zimbabwe, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Afghanista n, Grenada, Cambodia, and many other countries. All the good intentions in the wor ld are little comfort to the people buried prematurely all over the globe. What I want is for our government: • To quit pretending it knows what's best for other c ountries. • To quit inciting terrorists by backing coups and di ctatorial regimes. • To quit generating hostility by bribing foreign gov ernments to allow American troops to be stationed in a hundred countr ies. • To quit giving our money to foreign countries — no matter whose side they're on.

Insider David Frum, wrote in his b ook \"The Right Man\" that at the time of his inauguration in January 2001, Bush’s only fi rm policy objective was \"to dig Saddam Hussein out of power in Iraq.\" Since he's the President, he will most likely find a way to fulfill his desires — no matter how many people oppose him, here or overseas. And once the war is underway, a good deal of the an ti-war movement will collapse — as it always does when America goes to war. So what point is there in trying to stop the war? Can you stop it by yourself? Of course not. Can you and I together stop the war? Of course not. Can you and I and thousands of other people stop th e war? Perhaps, but we don't control thousands of other people. Each of us controls only himself. So why should we continue struggling? Why Delay Is Helpful I believe there's good reason to do so. The opposition to the war has helped keep Bush on t he defensive. Enough troops have been in place and enough missiles armed that the wa r could have started a month or more ago. And every day's delay seems to bring greater o pposition, as well as new revelations"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 373 of the flaws and misrepresentations in the administ ration's arguments. More and more people are coming to believe that it makes no sense to risk the lives of our young people and risk the safety of our cities by going to war a gainst a country that can't hurt us. George Bush's approval rating and public enthusiasm for his foreign policy have been slipping steadily. He's probably too arrogant to le t that stop him, but the erosion of support confirms that the longer we can delay the s tart of the war, the more people will oppose it. Why We Fight Perhaps neither you nor I can single-handedly creat e the tidal wave of opposition necessary to stop George Bush from continuing on hi s obsessive course. But every person we persuade that war should always be the last resort, rather than the first, is one more person no longer reciting the tr ite slogans of war, one more person who understands that our Keystone Kops can't make the M iddle East safe for democracy, one more person who understands that giving up our libe rty for a government-promised security will mean we have neither liberty nor secu rity. And the next time a President wants to drag us into a dangerous war, that one more person will be on our side from the beginning. And he'll be pointing out the dangers to his friends and associates. And among all the people we talk to, there may be s omeone who does have the power, the ability, and the influence to create that tidal wave of opposition that will force the politicians to quit putting us at risk. Having lived with the Cold War from the time I was 12 years old, I came to assume it would last for the rest of my life. I was happily a mazed when the communist Hungarian government opened its border to allow vacationing E ast Germans to flee into Austria. A few weeks later the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, and a year later the Soviet Union disintegrated. Miracles do happen. I don't know that a miracle will happen in the pres ent situation, but I know that it can happen. And so it's important to take every opportu nity to allow it to happen.

Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman voiced the slogans of many when he, \"It's time to come together to support our great American men and women in uniform and their commander-in-chief.\" And Senator Bob Graham (who mu st have the same speech-writer) pronounced, \"At a time like this, all Americans mus t come together to support our commander-in-chief and our men and women in uniform .\" I, too, support our boys in uniform — but in a diff erent way. I don't want to see a single one of them die in a useless war that will leave th e world no better than before, and that will probably make America much less safe — rather than more secure. As well, the Iraqi people have been starved and hur t and deprived enough. George Bush likes to talk about how Saddam Hussein has stalled for twelve years. But during those twelve years, three American Presidents have stalle d on ending the cruel and brutal sanctions that have left Iraqis without the food, m edicine, and income they need to live even at third-world levels. Everytime Hussein has c omplied with a demand from an American President, the Americans have upped the an te or called the compliance a \"cynical ploy.\" Now our \"boys\" are going to go over there to kill t housands of those poor Iraqis.

And you aren't pro-torture, are you?] "},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 380 Libertarians & War by Harry Browne May 3, 2003 I've been surprised by the number of libertarians w ho have supported the war against Iraq. The two principal arguments I've heard from liberta rian war-supporters are: Saddam Hussein is a threat to the U.S. We must remo ve him from power before he attacks us or gives weapons of mass destr uction to terrorists. We libertarians should be the first to support the liberation of the Iraqi people from a cruel dictator. The Threat With regard to the first argument, supporting a pol itician's pre-emptive attack violates virtually every principle underlying libertarian th ought — the simple truths that are taught in Libertarianism 101. For example . . . 1. Non-aggression: Most libertarians believe you shouldn't initiate f orce against someone who has never used force against you. Force is to b e used only in self-defense — not used just because you don't happen to like someone, or b ecause someone doesn't like you, or because he might become dangerous in the future, or because some thi rd party has attacked you and you want to prove you're not a wim p. The same principles must apply to our nation — that it shouldn't use force against a nation that hasn't attacked us. 2. Credibility of Politicians: The idea that Hussein posed a substantial threat t o America is based entirely on claims made by the Bush admini stration. When did libertarians start believing anything politicians say? Politicians rou tinely lie about fictitious budget surpluses, \"budget cuts,\" drug matters, crime stati stics, and almost anything else. Remember the old joke?: \"How can you tell when a politician is lying?\" \"His lips move.\" The Bush administration has already been caught in numerous falsehoods concerning Iraq: • claiming Iraq was consorting with Al-Qaeda (refuted by the),"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 381 • saying Iraq was acquiring aluminum tubes to make nu clear bombs (refuted by scientists and UN inspectors), • producing satellite photos of alleged chemical-weap ons sites (that on-the-spot investigations proved to have no chemical), • citing mobile chemical-weapons labs (that turned ou t to have no chemical weapons), • giving worthless leads to UN weapons inspectors, • claiming that Iraq was seeking enriched uranium (ci ting documents that turned out to be crude forgeries), • referring to a British dossier as evidence (a dossi er that turned out to have been plagiarized from a 12-year-old thesis written by a college student), . . . and much more. Even if none of these falsehoods had come to light, libertarians should always be skeptical of any claims made by politicians. 3. Government doesn't work: The federal government has devastated what was onc e the best health-care system in history, it is trash ing our children's schools, its Drug War has pulverized the inner cities, it has left chaos in its wake in Afghanistan. In fact, you'd be hard put to think of a single government program that fulfilled the rosy promises made for it. So why would you think the promises of Iraqi freedo m and democracy will be fulfilled? This is the same government that's messed up everyt hing else. Just because \"national defense\" is Constitutionally authorized doesn't mea n the government will handle it effectively. The Defense Department is nothing more than the Pos t Office in fatigues. And beating up a third-world country after disarmin g it isn't something any self- respecting country should put on its résumé. 4. Power will be abused: The President has been given tens of billions of d ollars to spend on Iraq as he chooses. Do you assume he'll us e it wisely, without a hint of corruption?"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 382 The FBI and other law-enforcement agencies have bee n given enormous new powers to jail people without warrant and hold them without t rial or legal counsel. Do you assume they will employ these powers only against America' s enemies? Do you really want to give government one more excu se to expand its size, its power, and its intrusions into your life? 5. Government programs never stand still: Every other government program has turned out to be far more expensive, far more intru sive, and extend into far more areas than proposed originally. Why should this war prove to be an exception? Do you really think the regime-changers — after tas ting the blood of innocents and the praise of the media and the citizenry — will go bac k to bickering about farm subsidies and school-lunch programs? Or will they look for more \"monsters to destroy\" (a s John Quincy Adams put it)? 6. Government is politics: Whenever you turn anything over to the government, it ceases to be a financial, medical, commercial, educ ational, or human-rights matter, and becomes a political issue — to be decided by whoever has the most poli tical influence. And that will never be you or I. Why should military matters be any different? Shoul d we be surprised that companies like Bechtel and Halliburton have already received hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts to rebuild Iraq without competitive biddi ng? Did you really think this war would be fought with no regard for political gain or abuse? 7. You don't control the government: You can look at the previous six items and say you would have handled some things differently. But who asked you? No one. And no one ever will. You don't make the decisions. The politicians use your support as endorsements fo r them to fulfill their objectives, not yours — in their way, not yours. That's true for health care, education, regulation — and it's true for military matters. In Sum . . . Government is force, and libertarians distrust forc e."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 383 They know it will be abused, they know force won't produce the results promised for it, they know politicians will lie about the exercise o f force, they know force will eventually be uncontrollable, they know that power is inevitab ly abused, and they know that no government program achieves its purpose and then go es quietly into the night. On every count of libertarian principles, we should demand that the use of force against foreign countries be reserved for response to direc t attacks — not to be used for \"regime change,\" not for \"democracy-building,\" not for pre- emptive attacks, not for demonstrations of strength. Freeing People The second argument offered by libertarians is that we should do anything we can to free other people from a brutal dictator. I won't even deal with the fact that most of our kn owledge of Hussein's brutality emanates from the U.S. government — hardly the plac e a libertarian would look for unbiased, authoritative information about anything . I'll also ignore the point that, while condemning H ussein's brutal dictatorship, the U.S. government is aiding dictatorships in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Pakistan, and many other countries. We shouldn't be surprised if we're told someday that we must go to war against those dictatorships, to free the people our tax dollars are helping to enslave today. Let's deal instead only with the idea that we have a responsibility to free people in other countries. Is it your responsibility to enter someone's home and beat up the man you believe is abusing his wife? Is it your responsibility to go into a dangerous section of y our city and protect people from drug gangs that engage in drive-by shootings? You might say the Drug War breeds those gangs and s hootings, and thus you're working instead to end the Drug War itself — rather than tr ying to alleviate the symptoms of it. Why then wouldn't you be working to end the causes of the profound anti-American sentiment that has swept the globe and provoked ter rorist acts — rather than trying to alleviate the symptoms by supporting the attacking of Iraq? Responsibility The answer to the question \"Is it your responsibili ty?\" is simple: that's for you to decide ."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 384 Each of us must choose for himself what he feels re sponsible for. If you believe you have a duty to help those fighting for Iraqi freedom — p erhaps even to go fight yourself — you should be free to make that choice, and no one should get in your way. But what gives you the right to make that choice fo r others? Why should you have the power or moral authority to decide which countries I must free, which countries warrant extracting money from me by force, which dictatorships warrant provoking terrorist attacks that put my life at risk? And what libertarian would believe that George Bush should have that moral authority — plus the power to compel all of us to obey that aut hority? You will face the consequences of your acts and I w ill face the consequences of mine. But George Bush won't face the consequences of his acts; you and I will. Is that the way it should be according to libertarian principles? I think not. And thus there is nothing George Bush can say that will make me believe I should put my faith in him to decide how many innocent Iraqis it' s okay to kill, how many countries it's okay to attack and invade, how many Americans it's okay to put at risk, or how many libertarian principles it's okay to violate.

Irrefutable knowledge that Hussein and Al-Qaeda wer e Saturday night drinking buddies has been replaced with — well, just about anything will do. But the coup de grace the Republicans fall back on, the #1 intimidation technique to be used on anyone who questions the good intentions of George W.

Obviously, it will be several years before anyone c an know with certainty whether the world is a better place for what the U.S. has done in Iraq. And anyone who claims to know now is just whistling in the dark. Rulers In the history of the world, there have been a few thousand rulers who had the kind of power George Bush has today — the ability to jail p eople without trial or accountability, the license to spy on every citizen, the power to c onquer other countries. Quick quiz : Name a ruler who had this much power but didn’t b ecome an absolute tyrant? ( Hint : There were very, very few.) Perhaps the real question should be: Is the world a better place with George Bush having so much power? And that question I can answer with certainty: no .

That’s not so easy to answer. It will be tempting for us to want anyone but Bush to be in the White House. And that encourages voting for whoever the Democratic candid ate is — Al Gore, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, whoever . The Democratic candidate may even pledge never to d o what George Bush just did — take the country into an undeclared and unprovoked war. The candidate may promise faithfully that he’ll never meddle in the affairs o f foreign countries. But don’t forget that George Bush as much as promis ed the same things when he was running for President. The problem isn’t the abuse of power. As Michael Cl oud has pointed out, the problem is the power to abuse . Whoever gets the power is almost certain to abuse it. A lot of people voted for George Bush because they couldn’t stand Al Gore, and now regret that they did.

People who don't deal in drugs stil l have their bank accounts and other property searched, and their assets are v ulnerable to forfeiture with no constitutional safeguards — in the name of some goal, such as \"a drug-free America,\" that is never reached. • Innocent people are taxed to pay for a program th ey may oppose intensely, but that satisfies the desires of politicians. • Americans lose the right to make their own choice s about their own lives. Force Is the Defining Factor But liberals need to understand that such collatera l damages exist in all government programs, because force is the defining factor in every government program. People are forced to do what they don't want to do, or are forcibly prevented from doing what they do want to do, or are forced to pay for things they d on't want to pay for. If you think some government program, law, regulati on, or tax doesn't involve force, try disobeying it — don't pay the Social Security tax, ignore an environmental regulation, or fail to register your gun — and see what happens.

The Same Force, Foreign or Domestic When our government mandates what kind of governmen t every country of the world should have, it's no different from the federal gov ernment mandating what kind of education system every American state should have — or what every health insurance policy must cover — or what products a company may offer — or how much corn a farmer can plant. If it's wrong to impose George Bush's choice of gov ernment on every citizen of a foreign country, it's just as wrong to impose anyone's choice of a health-care system on every American citizen. It simply can't be any of the government's business in a country that calls itself \"free.\" War is no different from government health care, go vernment education, government charity, government subsidies, government regulatio n, government compassion.

Means & Ends You may believe the force is being employed for a g ood purpose (just as the war-makers believe), but it is force nonetheless. And the forc e is imposed upon the innocent as much or more than the guilty. The force is employed . . . • To prevent consumers from buying what they want t o buy, and to prevent companies from selling what they want to sell — und er threat of fines and imprisonment. • To give bureaucrats the power to overrule the str ictly personal decisions of individuals — under threat of fines and imprisonmen t. • To take hard-earned money away from innocent peop le and use it in ways pleasing to politicians and bureaucrats — under thr eat of fines and imprisonment. • To impose monopoly suppliers on consumers or forc ibly outlaw competition in such critical areas as education, postal service , electricity, and water — under threat of fines and imprisonment. • To impose bureaucratic decisions on doctors, hosp itals, and insurance companies — enforced with fines and imprisonment fo r differences of opinion about diagnoses, fees, policies, or treatment. • To give politicians and regulators the power to w ithhold life-saving medicines from sick people — under threat of fines and imprisonment. The elements of war are employed in every government program, not just those involving disputes with foreign countries. In war, a few visible beneficiaries or promises (\"l iberating\" Afghans and Iraqis or \"making the world safe for democracy\") serve to obs cure the brutality, the horror, and the deaths of innocent people."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 392 With domestic government programs, a few visible be neficiaries or promises (a grateful subsidy recipient, \"health care for everyone,\" or a \"drug-free America\") serve to obscure the iron fist of the state — inflicting taxes on fa milies and forcing them to forgo getting braces for their daughters' teeth, or regulating ou t of business companies that were providing valuable services that people willingly p aid for. And the few visible beneficiaries obscure as well t he corruption and oppression that naturally follows from giving fallible human beings the power to coerce others. War is the quintessential big-government program. I t displays in stark relief the elements of all other government programs. War may seem more violent, more aggressive, more unjust, and more futile — but the differences betwe en war and other government programs are differences only of degree and visibil ity, not differences of kind. Power Is a Powder Keg It may seem that force is necessary to bring about worthy social objectives. But using force always sets in motion a series of events that you're bound to regret. Again, it is easier to recognize when war is the issue. For example, how has George Bush managed to get awa y with attacking a country that hasn't threatened us? Because Bill Clinton paved th e way for him. Very few liberals complained when Clinton invaded or bombed Haiti, Se rbia, Afghanistan, the Sudan, and Iraq. If liberals had protested then, it might have been easier today to stop the war in Iraq. And when conservatives protested Clinton's foreign adventures, they conveniently forgot that Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Sr. had already established the necessary precedents with attacks on Libya, Grenada, Nicaragu a, Panama, and Iraq. Every government program gives politicians power an d money that will be misused sooner or later. When you give power to a good Pres ident or a good Congress to do what you think are good works, you're automatically givi ng power to a future bad President or Congress to do bad works. The power doesn't disappear when a differen t party takes office. In addition, power always expands. You may enact a program to perform a specific function, but it automatically takes on a life of i ts own. The program grows — not just bigger, but in many directions — until it bears ver y little similarity to the \"good\" program you supported at the outset. Big government concentrates enormous power in one p lace. And that power is like a magnet, attracting the worst elements of society — people who seek to dominate others"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 393 and use the power for their own purposes. Not surpr isingly, such people always seem to find a plausible reason to impose wars, tyranny, an d the destruction of civil liberties. As Michael Cloud has pointed out, the problem isn't the abuse of power, it's the power to abuse. The only way to stop the abuse is to take aw ay the power. Doing Good Government is force. And you can't achieve good objectives by force, any more than you can bomb a country into democracy or peace. When you persuade someone to do something, he's a willing participan t. When you force him to do something, he immediately begins looking for ways to get around what you're demanding or to get back at you for what you've don e to his life. And when you forcibly confiscate money from one per son to satisfy the needs of another, the first person is inspired to reduce his earnings or hide his income and wealth — while the second is encouraged to continually expand his needs. So there's never enough money available from the ea rners to satisfy the needs of the takers. That's why government's use of force never produces the results promised for it: • Medicare was supposed to reduce health costs for the elderly and for society as well. So why does Medicare cost many, many times what was originally promised, and why do the elderly pay more out of th eir own pockets for health care (even after allowing for inflation) than they did before Medicare? 1 • We're told that extracting money by force and sho wering it on government schools will improve education. So why — after spen ding hundreds of billions of dollars — do the politicians still complain abou t the terrible conditions in schools and the need for more money? Welfare and Medicaid are perpetual scandals. Wastef ul, harmful corporate welfare and farm subsidies don't go away — no matter how many p romises are made, no matter how many reforms are enacted. Allowing politicians to confiscate our money by for ce empowers them to use it for what they want, not what you want. So a good part of it goes to keep foreign di ctators in power until those dictators can be cited as excuses to go to war. Why?"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 394 Why isn't there a single government program that ha s actually achieved what was originally promised for it? Not the elimination of poverty (\"The days of the dole in this country are numbered\" said Lyndon Johnson in 1964), not improved reading skills for children, not a \"drug-free America,\" not an end to gun violence, not anything. The reason for such universal failure is that coerc ion transforms everything it touches into something completely different from what was i ntended. With the use of force . . . • People in government get to spend other people's money, instead of money they had to work hard to earn — and they will never treat that money with the same care and respect they would give to their own earnings. • People in government never have to face the conse quences of wrong decisions that you or I have to face, and so there' s nothing to restrain them from pursuing utopian schemes endlessly or using th eir power to reward their friends and punish their enemies. This power is like a cornucopia — providing free mo ney, unearned markets, freedom from prohibited competition. No wonder there are sp ecial-interest groups, voting blocs, and constant selling pressure on the politicians to provide more and more unearned goodies. As a result, whenever you turn something over to go vernment, it ceases to be a financial, humanitarian, medical, military, or commercial matt er. It becomes a political issue — to be decided by whoever has the most political power. And that will never be you or I. Problem-Solving Big government hasn't solved a single problem. On t he contrary, it has always led to enormous problems. Just look at the way big governm ent has affected foreign affairs. Our government's overseas aggression was an outgrow th of the Progressive Era of the late 1800s and early 1900s. The expansion of govern ment into regulatory agencies and new functions fostered the concept that the U.S. go vernment could achieve good things for people — and should have the power to do so. Th e increased power gave the politicians the opportunity and the arrogance to oc cupy the Philippines to \"Christianize\" the heathen — causing the slaughter of thousands of innocent people. The imposition of the income tax in 1913 gave the p oliticians what they never had before — a virtually unlimited source of revenue. This fur nished the resources to interfere in a European war — something the U.S. government could never have done before. American intervention transformed a stalemated Worl d War I into an overwhelming"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 395 Allied victory — enabling the Allies to wreak havoc on Germany and give Germans the incentive to turn to Adolf Hitler. How could there have been U.S. wars in Afghanistan or Iraq the past two years if there were no income tax today — if the federal governmen t were still operating with the mere half-billion-or-so dollars in yearly revenue availa ble in the early 20th century? The U.S. government is now spending per week in Iraq twice as much as its entire yearly budget in 1903. America could never afford to have troops in over a hundred countries if the government were still small enough to fit within the Constitut ion. The $2 trillion budget has not only made the war on Iraq possible, it will facilitate t he war on Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, or whoever else is to be the next lucky country to be liberated by an all-powerful American President with an endless supply of money with whic h to play God. George W. Bush can do whatever he wants because he has the money and power to do it. Big government gives him the power to reward friend s like Halliburton, Bechtel, oil companies, and construction companies — and the pow er to destroy enemies, foreign or domestic. Making war requires big government to provide the n ecessary money and control over individuals. A nation with a small government can't set about to remake the world. Better Ways If liberals want to stop tyrannical adventures like the invasion of Iraq, they must do everything possible to whittle big government down to a small, limited, constitutional government. Not the \"limited government\" the Republ icans pay homage to in campaign speeches and ignore in practice, but the constituti onal straight-jacket envisioned by the likes of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The Founding Fathers knew first-hand how dangerous government can be. They intended the federal government to be limited to a few caref ully defined powers that are itemized in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. And th ey added the 9th and 10th Amendments to make it clear that these are the only powers the federal government is supposed to have. They provided a method by which the Constitution co uld be amended, but only by long and careful deliberation — not by Presidents playin g God or by Congressmen catering to the whims of politically powerful voting blocs. Voluntary Methods"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 396 Almost everything good we enjoy today has come from the efforts of individuals and companies acting voluntarily, not under the duress of laws and regulations. It didn't require coercion to produce low-cost comp uters available to people in almost all income brackets and getting cheaper by the month. I t didn't require coercion to discover penicillin or a polio vaccine. It didn't require th e coercion of the federal government to invent safety glass, disk brakes, seat belts, radia l tires, or any of the other auto-safety features we enjoy. No one had to be coerced to crea te the Salvation Army, Goodwill Industries, charity hospitals, or free clinics. Today there are over 300,000 churches in America. N ot one single person had to be coerced or have his earnings confiscated in order t o build and support these churches. Imagine what else could be done — the money availab le to help the poor, find low-cost cures for diseases, and educate our children more p roperly — if American families didn't have to pay an average of $10,000 a year in Social Security and income taxes. If we want to take care of the poor, improve health care, have better schools, and make America a peaceful, beloved nation again, we must t urn away from government and expand voluntary society. When people are free to make their own decisions, s ocial needs represent opportunities for someone to do well by doing good — either by co mpeting to sell lower-cost services directly to those who need them or by creating priv ate agencies to facilitate the liberal desire to provide for the needy. Such arrangements involve no force, no loss of anyo ne's civil liberties, no confiscation of anyone's property, no threats of fines or imprisonm ent, no single policy coercively imposed on everyone. Those arrangements don't build resentments. They do n't create struggles for winner-take- all pots of money and power that turn us into enemi es of each other. In the grocery store, you can buy Heinz ketchup while I buy Hunt's, and n either of us considers the other a threat to one's own well-being. With government, on e size fits all and so we necessarily become opponents in a fierce fight to make sure its one's own size that's chosen. No wonder there's so much class warfare, racial warfar e, and generation warfare in America. A society of free individuals acting voluntarily to help each other for mutual benefit should be exactly what liberals want.

America didn't fear anyone and no one feared America. Today Americans live in a state of siege. The idea of invading the Philippines or bombing the Sudan or intervening in Nicaragua or overturning a government in the Dominican Republic or starting a war with Iraq would have seemed ludicrous to the American people in 188 6. As John Quincy Adams put it, America didn't go abroad in search of monsters to d estroy. Today America has troops in over a hundred foreign countries. In 2003 the maximum personal income tax rate is 35% , plus 15% for Social Security tax. In 1886 the maximum income tax rate of any kind was 0%. In 1886 taxes at all levels of government consumed less than 7% of the national income. In 2003 taxes take roughly half the national income . In 1886 the federal government spent $242 million. In 2003 the federal government will spend over $2 trillion — 10,000 times as much. In 1886 the federal debt was $1.40 per person (adju sted for inflation to dollars of 2002 value). In 2002 the federal debt was $21,564 per pe rson. In 1886 there was no Securities & Exchange Commissi on, no Food and Drug Administration, no Interstate Commerce Commission, no Federal Trade Commission, no federal regulatory agencies of any kind. In 2003 ev ery conceivable thing in America is regulated in some way by some level of government. In 1886 there was no Federal Reserve System. The U. S. government simply minted coins from gold or silver brought to the Treasury. All pa per money was issued by private banks, who redeemed the paper money on demand with gold or silver. While there occasionally were bank failures, small panics, or c rashes, there was nothing to compare with the gigantic failure of the banking system and the Great Depression that occurred after the founding of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. In 1886 there were no crimes against the state — no drug laws, no prohibitions of any kind. People lived their own lives, and if you didn 't like the way someone lived, you simply didn't associate with him. You didn't run to the legislature to try to get a law passed to change his conduct; you just stayed away from him.

Lying for a Living by Harry Browne January 7, 2004 The Bush administration lied to the American people about many things in order to drag America into a war against a country that posed no threat whatsoever to it. The biggest lie, of course, was the idea that Iraq had so-called \"weapons of mass destruction\" (nuclear, biological, and chemical wea pons) that could kill millions of Americans. Now that it’s evident that there were no such weapo ns, the war hawks claim that George Bush never really said the Iraqi threat was imminen t. In fact, he supposedly said precisely the opposite — that we must stop Saddam Hussein before he can pose a threat to the United States. In fact, on October 7, 2002, George Bush said to a cheering crowd in Cincinnati: Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof — the smoking gun — that could come in the form of a mushroom clo ud. See! He didn’t say Hussein was an imminent threat — only that we must stop him before he becomes a threat."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 401 Unfortunately, for the war hawks, that isn’t what B ush meant — as is evident when that statement is placed in its original context: Knowing these realities, America must not ignore th e threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof — the smoking gun — that could come in the form of a mushroom clo ud. As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, \"Neither the United States of America, nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate decept ion and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longe r live in a world,\" he said, \" where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation’s security to constitute maximum peril .\" [italics added] Bush implied that we can’t wait for the \"actual fir ing of weapons\" before responding.

Is War Necessary? by Harry Browne January 16, 2004 I have managed to live on this planet for 70 years without ever striking another human being. There have been a dozen or so times when someone wa nted to fight me. I managed to talk my way out of a fight in most of those cases. In the few times I didn't succeed in avoiding a fight altogether, I managed to end the s cuffle without hitting the other person and without suffering any noticeable damage to myse lf. Granted, I've been fortunate. I grew up in a peacef ul suburban area. Had I had the bad fortune to have been born in the inner city in a ga ng neighborhood, I might not have avoided violence so easily. But that's an important point. Being fortunate in t he circumstances of my birth and my growing-up, I didn't squander that good fortune by looking for trouble. The U.S. by Birth America was also fortunate in the circumstances of its birth. After one apparently necessary fight to extricate i tself from British rule, it found itself in the best neighborhood possible. It is bounded by tw o friendly countries and two enormous oceans. No need here to look for trouble. And yet, ruled by American instead of British polit icians, the United States has found itself embroiled in one street fight after another. In fact, in the 20th century there were less than 2 0 years in which America was at peace with the world. What with World Wars, the Cold War, police actions, gunboat diplomacy"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 406 in Latin America, overthrowing governments in Iran and other places, suppressing the Philippine rebellion, interfering with the Mexican revolution, firing missiles at Afghanistan and the Sudan, invading Panama and Gren ada, bombing Libya, and on and on and on, Americans have lived with the tension of conflict and violence almost their entire lives. And we live in a good neighborhood! The Swiss by Birth Contrast our circumstances with those of Switzerlan d. The poor Swiss have the misfortune of living in the middle of one of the worst neighborhoods in the world. Centuries of imperial r ivalries, ethnic hatreds, governments armed to the teeth and ready to go to war at the dr op of the hat, and populations nursing grudges against each other — all these elements hav e kept Europe in turmoil for centuries. Switzerland is like the inner-city family that hear s gunfire outside its windows every night. And yet Switzerland hasn't been involved in a singl e war for two centuries. The Swiss managed to avoid being sucked into the World Wars, the Cold War, or any of the other conflicts that have beset Europe. The Swiss haven't been fortunate in their geographi cal circumstances. But they've dealt with those circumstances intelligently. It wasn't b y the grace of dictators that they've avoided war; it has been a national policy to do so . The Swiss have always made sure it was in the self- interest of warring nations to leave Switzerland out of their quarrels. They've devised ingenious defenses to demonstrate that, while Switzerland is not unconquerable, the cost of conquest would be intolerable to the conqueror. And they've made themselves an indispens able trading partner to any country that otherwise might see some profit in invading Sw itzerland. It may seem that war is inevitable for many countries — such a s the warring factions in the Balkans or some countries in Asia or Africa. Bu t Switzerland has proven that it isn't inevitable for anyone — not even for a country as p oorly situated as Switzerland is. Why then is America continually at war over one thi ng or another? The \"Last Resort\""},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 407 Whenever the U.S. goes to war somewhere, the politi cians tell us that diplomacy was tried and failed — and that war was the very, very, very last resort. But the truth is that the politicians didn't try mu ch at all to avoid war. And the diplomacy was bound to fail, because it involved our politici ans making insensitive demands on a foreign country — demands we had no authority to ma ke, demands that were known in advance to be unacceptable to the foreigners. In the few cases that America has been attacked, it 's been because our politicians were trying to dictate to other countries — countries th at represented no threat to us at all. The foreigners attacked either to try to gain an advant age against the stronger U.S. when our government had made war seem inevitable (as at Pear l Harbor), or because attacking seemed the only way to strike back at a country tha t was throwing its weight around in other people's business (as in 9/11). Our Neighborhood How easy it would have been for Americans to have l ived the past two centuries in peace. We have never been attacked by a country that hadn' t first been bullied by our politicians. Maybe others aren't so fortunately situated, but we are . No one can seriously believe that terrorists have s truck America because they hate our freedom, our democracy, or our prosperity. If that were true, they would have warmed up first by attacking Switzerland — an easier target. And if someone asks how you would handle the terror ists without war, now that Pandora's Box has been opened, here's a simple answ er: I'm not certain what I'd do, but I know one thing f or sure: With $2 trillion a year at my disposal, I could hire the best minds in the wor ld to find a solution that didn't involve using the cave-man tactics of trying to bea t people to death. But no one in power is interested in finding altern atives to war. They arm to the teeth and then tell us we will obtain \"peace through strength .\" Well, America has been overwhelmingly strong for a century, and we're still waiting to see the peace. As Charles Beard put it, we've had \" perpetual war for perpetual peace.\" Perhaps part of the problem is that we have an over whelming national offense, but practically no national defense. Is It Necessary?"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 408 I have never hit anyone, and not doing so has cause d me no humiliation; nor has it made me a target for bullies.

For Americans, yes — so long as we give politicians the power to meddle in our lives and in the lives of foreigners. Is War Necessary? – Part II by Harry Browne January 28, 2004 My article \"Is War Necessary?\" provoked a number of email comments and criticisms.

Either way, you end up being physical and moral cowards.\" You have me mixed up with someone else. Unlike liberals, and unlike you, I have no faith in government. It can't run the health-care system, doesn't educate our children well, and it c ertainly doesn't keep us safe from your \"big bad wolf.\" As for \"being physical and moral cowards\": If it's cowardly not to want to see innocent people killed, I guess I'm a coward. I'm not brave enough to taunt the villain and dare him to kill a bunch of other people."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 409 If you want to go over to the Middle East and fight for \"Iraqi Freedom,\" that's your business.

I hope you don't go off to fight in the Middle East. But I also wan t every American there to come home. I want to see America live in peace and liberty. An d big government doesn't provide either. Switzerland \"You misunderstand and misuse history. Switzerland has not had a war in lots of years because every Swiss is armed, is in the armed services until age 40, and shoots to kill anyone that violates their sovereign ty. \"They are at all times prepared to defend themselve s. And, being such a small country, even Hitler and Stalin and his successors felt that the cost of invasion was not worth the gain. \"Wake up, smell the coffee and live in the real wor ld, not some idealistic place in your warped mind and some place that has never exis ted.\" Since I said in my article \"They've devised ingenio us defenses to demonstrate that, while Switzerland is not unconquerable, the cost of conqu est would be intolerable to the conqueror,\" I'm not sure what you're complaining ab out. As a matter of fact, I lived in Switzerland for six years and am quite familiar wit h its defense system. But notice that it is focused on defense, not offense — as the U.S. sy stem is. \"One important fact not reported by Mr. Browne. Swi tzerland became a repository for Nazi gold during World War II as well as valuab le artifacts and paintings. When Germany lost the war, Switzerland simply kept the gold and other valuable items and founded a banking system that would not h ave been possible otherwise. \"In addition, Switzerland did cooperate with Nazi G ermany during the war and manufactured critical war materiel for the German w ar machine for which they were paid handsomely. \"Switzerland has kept out of conflict by being unde rhanded in its dealings and not because of any moral commitment. \"Sorry to burst your bubble.\""},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 410 Since I said in my article \"And they've made themse lves an indispensable trading partner to any country that otherwise might see some advant age in invading Switzerland,\" I'm not sure what new information you think you're providin g. The Swiss banking system was founded hundreds of ye ars ago. Laws were passed in the mid-1930s to protect Jewish accounts from being inv estigated or confiscated by the Nazis; otherwise, the system remained as it always had been. The only gold the Swiss bankers retained after the war was gold for which c laimants had no way to prove their ownership; you can't expect a banker to give someon e's gold to anyone who showed up at the door asking for it, but who had no evidence of ownership. And I don't see anything underhanded in dealing ope nly with Germany and Britain during the war. Not joining your side doesn't make someone underhanded, just discriminating. The last time I looked, the bubble was still intact and unburst. Swiss Profiteering \"One point about Switzerland. The reason they never go to war is because that is the enclave that the world's bankers use to house a ll the world's (their) money. And they are the ones that fund all the wars, and b oth sides of the wars. War is very profitable for them and keeps countries unstab le, while they remain in full charge through finances which is power.\" I understand what you're saying, but Switzerland do esn't fund wars. The Swiss government foreign aid program is infinitesimal — m uch too small to have any effect on anything. And the banks are privately owned. No pri vate bank is going to lend money to both sides of a war (as our government sometimes ha s). A bank can't afford to lend money to the loser who may not repay his loans. Swiss & American Defenses \"I'm curious about two points. \"1. Mr. Browne stated 'They've [the Swiss] devised ingenious defenses to demonstrate that, while Switzerland in not unconque rable, the cost of conquest would be intolerable to the conqueror.' What are th ese devices and/or where could I learn more about Switzerland's defense policies? \"2. He also wrote: 'In the few cases that America h as been attacked, it's because our politicians were trying to dictate to other cou ntries.' What were we doing to Japan to provoke the attack on Pear Harbor?\""},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 411 Unfortunately, not a lot has been written in the En glish language about Switzerland's ingenious World War II defense policies. And I don' t have time to try to remedy the lack of material. But I can give two examples. During World War II, the Swiss government allowed t he Nazis to pass through the Swiss Alps to resupply troops in Italy — a very valuable route for the Nazis. The Swiss mined critical spots and told the Nazis that the Swiss wo uld close the supply lines by blowing them up the moment the Nazis started any funny busi ness. Second, the Swiss made a deal with the Nazis that a llowed the Germans to buy machine tools from Swiss companies — but only on condition that Swiss boats be allowed to carry equipment for delivery to the British down the Rhin e River to the North Sea, unimpeded by the Nazis. As for the other question, the Roosevelt administra tion browbeat the Japanese for two years before the Pearl Harbor attack — demanding th at the Japanese give up their colonies and conquests in China and East Asia. The Japanese were absolutely no threat to the United States (just like Iraq in 2003), but Roo sevelt made it clear to his subordinates (who later reported his views in their memoirs) tha t he wanted to lure the Japanese into \"firing the first shot\" so that America could get i nto the war against Hitler. (The Japanese and Germans had a mutual defense treaty.) I don't know of a single historian today who believ es the Pearl Harbor attack was either unprovoked or a surprise. The only argument is over whether Roosevelt was right to bully the Japanese into attacking, in order to rall y the American people to support U.S. entry into the war. Here are some links to more detailed information: The Myths of World War II by Harry Browne American Knowledge of the Coming Japanese attack; i nterview with Robert B.

Anti-war rhetor ic may catch their ear, but once they learn of the Libertarian position on governmen t, taxes and guns, they will switch us off.\" If we go along with the war hawks, how can we ever expect the war mentality to recede? Someone has to stand up and point out the obvious — that t he Bush doctrine has caused tens of millions more people worldwide to believe A merica is a bully, encouraging more people to support the terrorists. Maybe we couldn't stop the Iraqi War. But pointing out that politicians lie and that war isn't necessary may cause a few more people to be s keptical the next time — when the President (either Bush or Kerry) is trying to build support for attacking Syria, Iran, or someone else. We can't determine the truth of a proposition by th e number of people it might appeal to. I'm not saying what I think might appeal to Dean su pporters.

Character Assassination And we need to add to these prevarications the char acter assassination the administration fires at anyone who exposes its lies by relating pe rsonal experiences within the administration. Paul O'Neill and Richard Clarke hav e felt the full force of the government-press partnership. The moment Clarke went public with statements that Bush was determined to blame 9-11 on Iraq, and that Bush was much more eager to attac k Iraq than attack Al-Qaeda, the administration redirected the dogs of war from Huss ein to Clarke. Top administration officials have already appeared on numerous national news shows. Condoleezza Rice showed up on all five national mor ning shows (on NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, and CNN). The attack dogs said very little abo ut the actual charges, preferring to attack Clarke personally as a hypocrite who previou sly praised President Bush's response to terrorism. Providing their usual support for big government, T V and press reporters repeated and discussed statements Clarke made in 2001 and 2002 — statements that seemed to back up the charge that Clarke was an opportunistic hypocri te. But did you notice that every reporter showed us ex actly the same statements from Clarke? Some of the apparent \"statements\" weren't e ven complete sentences. Why did everyone who commented on Clarke's apparent flip-fl op focus on exactly the same fragments? They did so because those were the only fragments t hey had to work with. The quotes were all provided by the Bush administration — and they're the only quotes available. If the reporters had possessed the original documents, some of them would have picked out other statements or fragments from those documents. It is very, very, very important to realize that . . . Virtually everything we think we know about a forei gn-policy issue is only what the government tells us. We have no way of knowing whether the fragments are actually true statements Clarke once made. Nor do we know in what context the fragm ents appeared originally. All we know is that this is what the administration wants us to believe."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 415 Even if every fragment is true and indicative of Cl arke's previous opinions, it doesn't mean he's a hypocrite. What he said in 2001 or 2002 may have seemed true to him at the time, but has since been refuted by reality. For example, Clarke supposedly said in 2002 that th e Bush administration \"changed the strategy from one of rollback with Al Qaeda over th e course of five years, which it had been, to a new strategy that called for the rapid e limination of Al Qaeda.\" But that doesn't mean the strategy did change. Politicians continually make statements pro mising revolutionary improvements that never come to pass. One year after making that statement, Clarke quit working for the government — partly, we presume, because Bush's actions didn't match his promises. Fox TV News has provided a complete transcript of a press briefing Clarke gave in 2002 — from which the above quote was taken. You can sea rch the entire transcript and not find unequivocal praise for George Bush. We have no way of knowing what Clarke really though t about Bush in 2001 and 2002, because we have mostly only out-of-context fragment s of statements Clarke made — fragments that have been carefully selected and rel eased by the Bush administration in order to discredit Clarke. And the press dutifully publicizes those statements without pointing out that they are necessarily only small, out-of-context pieces of the puzzle. So let me repeat what you should never forget . . . Virtually everything we think we know about a forei gn-policy issue is only what the government wants us to know. Other Postwar Lies What about the Bush administration's postwar lies? . . . • The world is a safer place with Saddam Hussein go ne. Is it really? Tell that to the 200 people who died in Spain two w eeks ago — or to their families. Tell it to the Israelis who continue to be killed in Pal estine suicide attacks.

The country is occupied by a foreign power. Its officials are appointed by that foreign power. Its citizens must carry ID cards, and submit to sea rches of their persons and cars at checkpoints and roadblocks. They must be in their homes by curfew time. Many towns are ringed with barbed wire. The occupiers have imposed strict gun-control laws, preventing ordinary citizens from defending themselves — making robberies, rapes, and assaults quite common. The occupiers have decreed that certain electoral o utcomes won’t be permitted.

Private homes are raided or demolished — with no du e process of law. Newspapers, radio stations, and TV are all supervis ed by the occupiers. Brutality • Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. So what? Is it the duty of the American people to give their resources — and maybe their lives — to topple every dictator in the world and make sure the Bill of Rights is enforced in every country (except, perhaps, the United States)? And if toppling dictators is so important, why is G eorge Bush cozying up to brutal dictators in Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan ? If George Bush wants to donate his own money to rev olutionary movements in oppressed countries, he has a right to do so.

The Bush administration says Clarke is an opportuni stic S.O.B. who once praised President Bush, but now criticizes Bush in order to boost sales of Clarke's book. Which one is correct? That's the burning question the press focuses on da y after day after day. Everyone in radio, TV, or print publications seems to have a ve ry firm answer to the question, one way or the other. But if you have an answer, you've been snookered — maneuvered into pondering the wrong question. The Real Issue The 9-11 Commission is supposedly focusing on all a spects of the attack — all aspects except the one that is by far the most important qu estion: why did the hijackers knowingly give up their lives to destroy the World Trade Cent er? President Bush has a ready answer. He tells us it’s because they hate American freedoms, American democracy, and American prosperity. Of course, there are people around the world who ar e cranks, malcontents, or Stars-and-Stripes-phobes who simply don't like Amer ica — for all kinds of reasons. But how could any intelligent person believe that t here are hundreds — more likely, thousands — of people around the world who would kn owingly sacrifice their lives just to protest American freedom, democracy, or prosperi ty? As Charley Reese has put it:"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 419 It is absurd to suppose that a human being sitting around suddenly stands up and says: \"You know, I hate freedom. I think I'll go bl ow myself up.\" The Motive There was only one possible motive for the 9-11 att ackers: they were protesting the way the American government has been using force for ha lf a century to overrule the wishes of people in the Middle East and elsewhere. Our government has overthrown democratically electe d governments, it has supported with money and weapons dictatorial governments that have tortured and killed dissenters (just as George Bush keeps saying Saddam Hussein wa s doing), it has bribed foreign governments to join in enterprises of the U.S. gove rnment (as it did with Spain and tried to do with Turkey before Operation Kill Iraqis). Because of very little press coverage, most America ns have no idea that our government has been doing these things. How many people know, for example, that Iran had a democratically elected government until the U.S. an d British governments engineered a coup to install the tyrannical Shah of Iran in 1953 ? Then there was all the U.S. government help to Diem in South Vietnam, Suharto in Indonesia, Somoza in Nicaragua, Batista in Cuba, Tr ujillo in the Dominican Republic, Stalin during World War II, Lumumba* in the Congo, Saddam Hussein in Iraq (yes, that Saddam Hussein), and dozens more tyrants — all of w hom used American taxpayer money to oppress their own citizens. Americans may not know about the support provided t o these tyrants by the U.S. government, but I can assure you that plenty of peo ple in those countries do know what our government has done to them. Because Americans know so little about the history of our government's adventures of the last 50 years (and the last place anyone's likely t o learn about them is in a government school), it's easy for Americans to buy George Bush 's logic when he says, \"See, these people hate freedom.\" Consequently, most people bel ieve that the history of violence began on 9-11, when it's actually been building for 50 years. It isn't even just history. Today George Bush is se nding money and other resources to governments in Uzebekistan, Turkminestan, Azerbaija n, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan — governments that are oppressing their subjects in m uch the same way Hussein was supposed to have oppressed Iraq."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 420 So if the 9-11 Commission has any interest in preve nting future 9-11s, why isn't it discussing the role U.S. foreign policy played in c reating 9-11 — and is continuing to play today? Public Debate Perhaps you don't agree with me. You may think our government was justified in everything it has done. Or maybe you think I'm over stating the importance of American support of oppressive foreign governments. Fair enough. But you must admit that this is a legi timate issue to be debated. So why isn't the 9-11 Commission studying it? Why aren't journal ists and TV hosts interviewing people on both sides of the question to help form o pinions? Why is there only one question to be debated on any issue? Why, for example, didn't any of the coverage of the Martha Stewart case focus on the question of whether insider trading actually hurts anyone? Why was there a deba te about whether a juror's run-in with the police was grounds for a mistrial — when h is after-trial statements demonstrated that he found Stewart guilty for something she wasn 't even on trial for — a much more significant reason for a mistrial? The press — including (especially) the TV experts — will usually focus on the wrong aspect of any case or issue. This is probably becau se reporters, journalists, and TV experts are mostly all big-government people. So th e debate is about whether some politician handled something in the best possible w ay — rather than debating whether the government should have been involved at all.

As Thomas Pynchon said (in Gravity’s Rainbow), \"If they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answe rs.\" In almost all matters, the real question should be: why are we letting government handle this? ------- * Patrice Lumumba was a Communist who studied in Mosc ow, and there's a university there that used to be named after him. When the Congo received its independence from Belgium in 1960, Lumumba became the Congo's leader. Katanga province, under the leadership of Moise Tshombe, tried to secede from t he Congo.

Of course, as with so many other dictators the U.S. helped (such as Saddam Hussein or Manuel Noriega), the U.S. government eventually tur ned against Lumumba and may have been responsible for his death.

Transformation The sight of these horrors is enough to transform a lmost anyone into a person quite different from the one who went to war to \"defend f reedom.\" Eugene B. Sledge wrote about his reaction when, as a U.S. Marine fighting in the Pacific during World War II, he saw his comrades hosed down by machine-gun fire: I felt sickened to the depths of my soul. I asked G od, \"Why, why, why?\" I turned my face away and wished that I were imagining it all. I had tasted the bitterest essence of war, the sight of helpless comrades being slaughtered, and i t filled me with disgust. . . . We were expendable. It was difficult to accept. We come from a nation and a culture that values life and the individual. To find oneself in a situation where your life seems of little value is the ultimate in loneliness. It was a humbl ing experience. 1 In World War I, a French soldier wrote in his diary : Heaps of corpses, French and German, are lying ever y which way, rifles in hand.

Two or three men go mad every day. 2 In this kind of environment, human beings become so mething quite different — and less human. When the boy next door comes home from Iraq, he won't be the same one who left. He will have lived in a world completely diff erent from that of you and me — and completely different from the pictures shown on TV. The Atrocities Follow Quoting Sledge again: Our code of conduct toward the enemy differed drast ically from that prevailing back at Division CP. . . . We lived in an environment total ly incomprehensible to men behind the lines. 3 Thus we shouldn't be surprised to find soldiers tak ing delight in activities that disgust us. As Paul Fussell has pointed out, this is what happe ns \"when you arm a lot of frightened boys with deadly weapons.\" 4 It has happened in every army in every war — includ ing the Iraqi War, and undoubtedly in areas of the Iraqi occupation that are yet to be revealed. Fussell, in his book Wartime , wrote about atrocities committed by both Japanese and American soldiers during World War II — atrocities so repulsive they can't be described here in a family website. In a kill-or-be-killed environment, emotions run hi gh. Men don't just oppose the enemy, they hate him. And when they think information migh t save a buddy, they will commit heinous acts to extract the information from a pris oner. There's only one way to stop such things from happe ning: don't go to war in the first place . Responsibility So if anyone is responsible for the atrocities that were recently revealed, it is the person that decided to send 150,000 Americans to a desolat e area to kill or be killed. I believe that person's name is George W. Bush. But how can George Bush be held responsible for the crimes of subordinates way down the chain of command?"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 424 Well, Herman Goering was sentenced to death at the Nuremberg trials for crimes committed by his underlings.

Now everyone in the administration is feigning shock and awe over what happened. But that's not the most remarkable aspect of this w hole brouhaha. Long after George Bush knew about the prisoner abuse, he was still ju stifying the war on Iraq on the basis that Hussein had torture chambers. William Saletan of Slate has compiled an amazing chronicle of administration statements, made after Bush knew about the U.S. military's use of torture, implying that only Saddam Hussein d id such terrible things. As recently as May 1, even after the scandal had been made public , George Bush was still talking about Hussein’s torture chambers. This indicates that, in addition to being dishonest , Bush also is a bit dense. An intelligent knave would have quit talking about Hussein's \"tort ure chambers\" the moment he discovered that his own army was using torture. --------- 1 With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene B.

Everything in life has a price — even getting rid o f Saddam Hussein. Any goal or result must be compared with the price to be paid — in ord er to determine whether the goal is, or was, worth it. No goal can be said to be worth any price.

Every night for almost a week, ESPN's Sports Center show had a segment on Tillman — as did so many other news shows. I found the celebration of death to be upsetting, b ut I couldn't find the right words to express my feelings. But this past week I had the pleasure of watching — as I do every few years — the movie The Americanization of Emily . In it, the hero articulates what I was unable to sa y: \"My brother died at Anzio . . . an everyday soldier 's death, no special heroism involved. They buried what pieces they found of him . But my mother insists he died a brave death and pretends to be very proud. . . . \"Now my other brother can't wait to reach enlistmen t age. . . . What has my mother got for pretending bravery was admirable?

Let's Go to the Movies The Americanization of Emily is one of my favorite movies, and it's certainly o ne of the best anti-war movies ever made. However, it has a strange origin. It's based on a n ovel by William Bradford, a writer of many best-selling novels of a few decades ago. The hero, Charlie Madison, is stationed in London d uring World War II, working as an admiral's \"dog robber\" — a naval officer who makes sure the admiral and his guests have all the good food and entertainment they want, desp ite wartime shortages."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 428 Emily is a British motor-pool driver whom Charlie m eets and falls in love with. She doesn't like \"Yanks\" because they think they own th e world, but Charlie eventually Americanizes her. The admiral wants to make a movie showing that the first Americans to reach France on D-Day are naval demolition engineers, clearing the mines so the soldiers and marines can hit the beach. He commands Charlie to be there with a camera filming the operation. But Charlie is a coward, and he thinks it's absurd to risk his life in order to help the Navy get bigger appropriations from Congress. However, a s he grudgingly takes on the project, he becomes progressively more gung-ho — and eventua lly he's a true believer. Sort of like Dick Cheney without the desk job. Transformation The novel was made into a movie in 1964, and the sc reenplay was written by Paddy Chayefsky (whose work includes Network and Marty ). In Chayefsky's version, however, Charlie Madison do esn't get religion and become gung- ho. But his best friend does , and the friend forces Charlie at gunpoint to char ge onto Omaha Beach on D-Day. I won't say any more about the plot, because I don' t want to spoil it for you. It's too good a movie not to let the story unfold on its own. The movie isn't preachy, although Charlie Madison ( played by James Garner) has some sensational monologues. It is first and foremost en tertaining. But it ends with the most fascinating moral dilemma you'll find in any movie. At least half the people I know who've seen the movie think it ended wrongly, while the other half think the ending is perfect. Amazon has VHS copies for sale and, most likely, yo ur local Blockbuster store has copies for rent. but There's no DVD version. James Garner is a fine actor, and he has been fortu nate in having three of the juiciest roles in movies and television — Charlie Madison in The Americanization of Emily , Jim Rockford in the Rockford Files , and the title role in Cash McCall (another movie with libertarian undertones). I don't think you'll regret seeing any of these.

Along with the awards for best comedy, best drama, and such, was the award for the best news sh ow on television. And the winner? The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central. That's right, on the Comedy Central channel. And if you've ever seen the show, you can understand how it won the award. Stewart calls it a \"fake news show.\" And there are fake news reports here and there. But what makes the show so successful, I think, is the true news reporting that it does. Virtually every show includes actual clips of polit icians being hypocritical, contradictory, or just plain stupid. For example, showing George B ush saying \"This country is in great danger\" and then showing him three days earlier say ing \"America is much safer now.\" Just after the critics' award was announced, on one of those weekend shows in which a panel discusses the media's handling of current new s, the host mentioned the award and asked whether this was some kind of joke. One of th e panelists immediately leaped to the defense of the award — pointing out that The Daily Show was the only program expressing any real skepticism prior to the Iraqi w ar, and that the show was holding the politicians' feet to the fire in a way the broadcas t and cable news shows refuse to do.

But he had one disappointing interview with Wolf Bl itzer of CNN. Stewart kept pressing Blitzer for an answer as to how such a horrible mis calculation could have been made that brought about the invasion of Iraq. Blitzer kept an swering, in effect, that it was a case of \"Oops, I made a mistake.\" In other words, everyone makes mistakes; so why can't the CIA and the President occasionally be wrong? Not once did either Stewart or Blitzer acknowledge that this particular \"Oops\" caused the deaths of thousands of innocent people. Not once wa s the death of even one person referred to. The \"Oops\" was treated in the same way as a federal budget miscalculation. Life is the most important possession any human bei ng has. And to snuff it out is the worst possible crime. But to do it so casually as p oliticians do, to act as though it is something wonderful that some poor soul has \"died f or his country\" — that's adding insult to murder.

No, spend the blood of individual young me n who were conscripted — shanghaied, kidnapped, put into slavery — to do t he dying for Woodrow Wilson. How did those young men end up? Shirley Millard, an American nurse in an army hospi tal in France, later wrote about her experience. She was shocked by the terrible reality of what happens to soldiers in war. She could see that they weren't privileged to spend their blood. She described one batch of wounded brought into the hospital: They cannot breathe lying down or sitting up. They just struggle for breath. But nothing can be done. Their lungs are gone. Some wit h their eyes and faces entirely eaten away by the gas and bodies covered with burns . . . .

But make no mistake about it, we are winning, and we will win. (Applause.) We will win by staying on the offensive. We will win by spreading liberty. However, NBC News did a study of terrorist attacks and found that \"we\" aren't winning the war on terrorism after all. Between September 1 1, 2001, and the end of 2003 — a period of 26½ months, there were 1,220 terrorist at tacks worldwide — an average of 42 per month. But in the first 8 months of this year, there have already been 1,709 such attacks — an average of 213 per month. So the attac ks are increasing, not diminishing.

If the answer is nothing, as I'm sure it is, he is in no position to weigh the cost because he hasn't paid any cost. Only those who have lost love d ones can answer the question as to whether the cost is worth whatever dubious benefits Rumsfeld thinks the war has brought to us. In a similar way, Madeline Albright (Clinton's Secr etary of State) decided that the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children was a pr ice worth paying in order to maintain the sanctions that prevented food and medicines fro m reaching Iraq during the 1990s. On May 12, 1996, on 60 Minutes , Lesley Stahl asked her, \"We have heard that a hal f a million children have died. I mean, that's more chi ldren than died in Hiroshima. Is the price worth it?\" Albright responded by saying, \"I t hink this is a very hard choice, but the price — we think the price is worth it.\" Since human life is so expendable, I guess this mea ns that the people in the Bush administration believe that the 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 were a price worth paying in order to continue the American foreign policy of ruling t he world.

If he fails in that endeavor, it most likely will b e because American voters will have rejected him on the very issue he thought was his b est asset: his strong leadership in the War on Terrorism. In case you haven't noticed, things aren't working out as planned in Iraq. Even U.S. military leaders are starting to talk, an d they're saying that the entire Iraqi campaign is a terrible disaster. Kill 'em! But why should it be? After all, the Bush administration has done exactly what so many people have recommended — impose overwhelming force to achieve victory. Since 9/11 I've received dozens (perhaps hundreds) of emails from people cal ling for exactly that. Here's a paraphrased summary of what these emails say: The only thing the terrorists understand is force. The U.S. should blitzkrieg them with so much force that they realize that their cau se is futile. For every one of ours that dies in a terrorist attack, we should kill a h undred of them, without worrying whether the dead were terrorists or innocent bystan ders. You can't reason with these people; they don't understand anything but fo rce. None of the emails revealed that the writers had ar rived at their conclusions through actual discussions with terrorists, but no matter. The email writers were joined by a lot of people in the press, radio, and television in their belief that the only answer was overwhelming force. Force in Action When four U.S. civilians were killed in Fallujah, J oseph Farah of World Net Daily said: It's time to take off the velvet gloves. It's time to stop being Mr. Nice Guy [sic]. It's time to cease worrying about collateral damage . It's time to show all Iraqis and their brothers and sisters throughout the Middle East that it doesn't pay to mess with Americans. Th ey need to see there is no profit"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 438 in it. They need to understand we mean business. Th ey need to accept things will never be the same in Iraq. They need to feel the he at. They need to be provided with visible disincentives to further attacks on Am ericans, free Iraqis and other coalition partners. . . . We should not try to gain an international consensu s for this action. We should not apologize for it. We should not restrain our Ai r Force and our artillery batteries from wreaking devastation. We should not expose our ground troops to unnecessary risks. In other words, we may need to flatten Fallujah. We may need to destroy it. We may need to grind it, pulverize it and salt the soi l, as the Romans did with troublesome enemies. Quite frankly, we need to make an example out of Fa llujah. Here's a chance for justice. Here's an opportunity to show the people of the Middle East it doesn't pay to resort to barbarism and terr orism. In effect, the U.S. military took Mr. Farah's advic e. The city was pulverized. At least 600 Iraqis — mostly civilians — died in the American at tack, which was a reprisal for the deaths of just 4 Americans. As John Pilger has pointed out, this is no differen t from when members of the World War II French Resistance (the same \"spineless\" French t hat conservatives like to make jokes about) killed or kidnapped a Nazi in occupied towns , causing the Nazis to shoot dozens of innocent Frenchmen in reprisal. In Iraq the reprisal failed. The Americans eventual ly had to withdraw entirely from the city, and content themselves with an occasional bom bardment. Now the city is run by Islamic emirs and mujahideen who enforce Islamic la w strictly. (There probably are quite a few Fallujah residents who would prefer Saddam Hu ssein to either the Americans or the Islamic emirs.) But notice the important outcome: once the Americans abandoned Fallujah, so did the news media . We no longer get daily news reports about that ci ty. Few people in the U.S. are aware of what's going on in Fallujah.

And, contrary to expectations, Iraqis seem to mista ke American \"liberators\" for foreign occupiers. So what should Bush do — assuming that he's more co ncerned about reelection than about the future of Iraq? As I see it, he has two choices available to him: Door #1 The first choice is to elevate the force being used against the Iraqi resistance. He can send more troops to Iraq — even reactivating the draft, if necessary to acquire enough bodies. In other words, he can keep moving in the direction he's been going. As we've seen, this hasn't worked out very well, it has produced skepticism even among some of his supporters, and it should now be eviden t that no amount of force is going to \"pacify\" Iraq. Door #2 The second choice is to do what he did in Afghanist an — declare victory and withdraw attention from the battleground, taking the country out of the news and allowing people to believe George Bush when he says that all is wel l. Afghanistan is a mess.. There has been no victory t here. But because the President turned our attention to Iraq , no one notices the violent Civil War that rages i n Afghanistan. So Bush could go before the American people in Octo ber and say something like this: My fellow Americans, I have very good news for you. We continue to win the War on Terror. Our latest victory is the liberation of Iraq.

We also have signed an agreement with the Iraqi gov ernment to buy all of Iraq's oil production — guaranteeing that Iraq will be abl e to grow, be self-sufficient, and prosper economically. God bless America, God bless Iraq, and don't forget to vote next week. Opposition? Needless to say, there will be voices raised that s ay this pronouncement is a sham. There is no peace, no liberation in Iraq. But a majority of Americans will never hear the reb uttals, only the President's claims. After all, there were people in late 2002 pointing out that \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" was a stupid idea, but their arguments received only a fraction of the news coverage that was given to Bush's claims. Expecting John Kerry to take apart anything George Bush says is about as realistic as expecting George Bush to keep a campaign promise. A nd CNN, Fox News, and the broadcast networks will interview plenty of adminis tration sycophants who will congratulate the President on a job well done. Once the election is over and Bush is safely in the White House for another four years, anything can happen.

Iraq will be off the front pages, out of the Evenin g News, and out of the minds of American citizens. Like Afghanistan, Iraq will be t hought of as just one more \"victory\" in the War on Terrorism.

Fighting communism by Harry Browne "},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 447 October 19, 2004 I received the following email: A friend of mine read your article \"Can America Bri ng Peace to the World?\" [in which you said that the U.S. government has always failed to deliver on the promises made when entering a war, including entering the Cold Wa r]. He said you failed to mention that American intervention stopped the Communists f rom taking over Greece and Turkey in 1946. He also said that North Korea and South Ko rea today are not in similar situations. South Korea is the next Japan and North Korea is in the pits. What say you, Harry Browne? Your friend didn't go far enough. He should have me ntioned other Cold War triumphs of the U.S. government — such as overthrowing the demo cratic government of Iran and imposing the tyrannical Shah in 1953; helping the I ndonesian dictator Suharto as he slaughtered at least 250,000 Indonesians and then a t least 150,000 East Timorese, and continuing to train Indonesian thugs on into the 19 90s; installing and protecting dictators throughout Latin America, Asia, and Africa — all in the name of protecting innocent people from tyranny. As for South and North Korea, the U.S. government f ought for the dictatorial regime of Syngman Rhee in the Korean War. As it turns out, So uth Korea eventually discarded the shackles of oppressive government while North Korea has yet to do so. But that hardly justifies the price Americans paid for going to war to support a dictator — 33,651 American soldiers dead, an escalation of the federa l budget, civil liberties ignored, rationing, and much else. Not only did the Korean W ar not free subjugated people, it added 150 million Americans to the ranks of the sub jugated. Fighting Communism, Part II by Harry Browne October 22, 2004 "},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 448 Yesterday I received the following email: Your October 19th journal entry failed to address t he claim that \"American intervention stopped the Communists from taking ove r Greece and Turkey in 1946.\" Can you comment on this? I don't know much about the intervention in Turkey. I will be researching it for my forthcoming book on American wars. However, I'm quite familiar with the situation in G reece. It was considerably different from the way it's normally described. American inte rvention there established the \"Truman Doctrine,\" which today neo-conservatives de light in citing as a precedent for their proposals to have America police the world. T hus there is a great incentive to perpetuate the myth that Harry Truman's bold interv ention prevented a Communist takeover of Greece at the end of World War II. In fact, however, there was absolutely no danger of such a Communist takeover. Near the end of the war Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agr eed that each of their three countries would have postwar control over whichever countries it liberated from the Nazis. This gave the Soviets a free hand in Eastern Europe, and it gave the British a free hand in Greece, among other places. The Soviets kept their word and stayed completely out of the Greek Civil War — intervening only at the end to or der the Greek Communist Party to give up the battle. The Greek Communist Party was actually only a small part of the Popular Front that opposed the ruling Greek government. That governmen t was extremely oppressive — squashing civil liberties, assassinating opponents, and rigging what few elections were allowed to take place. The British tried to help th e Greek government ward off the rebellion, but their resources were exhausted from the World War. So the Americans stepped in and provided arms and ammunition (but no t troops) to the Greek government, and that was sufficient to end the rebellion eventu ally. The Greek Civil War (as it was called) was a never a struggle between the forces of freedom and Communism. It was simply a rebellion ag ainst an oppressive government (which is not to say that a rebel victory would hav e made Greece any more of a free country). The U.S. government intervened, as it did in so many purely local disputes, for reasons other than that of fighting communism. What, then, was the real reason the U.S. intervened ? "},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 449 Mainly, the alleged need to combat Communism in Gre ece gave President Truman the clout to hike the military budget significantly, to impose restrictions on the American people, and to clamp down on alleged communists ins ide the U.S. government. In the same way, from 1945 through 1950 all military intel ligence indicated that the Soviets were too weak to consider invading Western Europe, but administration officials continually went before Congress and claimed that i ncreased American military might was necessary to stop the Soviets from overrunning the continent. They dropped that claim only when the Korean War began and provided a more visible excuse to expand the U.S. government. From 1945 through 1991, virtually every dispute bet ween a pro-American dictator and his local opposition was depicted as a titanic stru ggle to preserve freedom by preventing Communists from taking over another country. It wor ked well, and so today our politicians depict every terrorist or guerrilla att ack anywhere in the world as an attempt by Al-Qaeda to advance its plans to destroy America n civilization. The Transportation Security Agency has cited the Chechen attack in the Russian city of Beslan (one more battle in a decades-old conflict) as a reason to ma ke life even more uncomfortable and humiliating for U.S. airline passengers. And during the Cold War, we were told that we had t o fight the Communists in Greece (or Korea or Guatemala) so that we wouldn't have to fight them in New York or Los Angeles — just as today we're told that Americans a re fighting in Iraq so that we won't have to fight in Seattle or Aspen. This is not to say that the Communists were peace-l oving agrarian reformers. They weren't. But they also were not the constant, immin ent danger that our politicians made them out to be. However, we'll leave that issue for another time. The story of how our government manipulated the sit uation in Greece in order to gain bigger budgets and greater control over Americans i s important because it is being duplicated today — as our government uses any erupt ion anywhere in the world as an excuse to expand its dominance over our lives. And the irony is that today's war-mongers are citin g the Greek conflict as evidence that America can triumph over its enemies if it will onl y act boldly and ruthlessly. In fact, the more \"boldly\" America acts, the more enemies it cre ates — in the 1940s and today. The more things change . . .

There has been throughout history, and continues un interrupted today, hordes of people who need no more excuse than their own bloodthirsty and genocidal impulses to aggress on others. Think about the sort of being that enjoy s slowly sawing off the head of someone else. Think of Hitler's concentration camps and gas chambers. Think of Stalin's gulags. Think of Mao's mass starvation. Think of Po l Pot's killing fields. Did they do these things because they had legitimate grievances ? I don't know. Do the people inside America — who ki dnap, torture, and kill other people — have legitimate grievances? Should we start bombi ng New York? Chicago?

Mostly those thugs are feared and condemned by resp ectable people. But when millions of people — well-meaning, relatively decent people — give their support to those thugs — as they did with Hitler and as they are today wit h the terrorists — you know that there are legitimate grievances that allow the thugs to comm and the respect of others. To whatever extent you dismiss those grievances, you m ultiply the support given to the thugs. What the thugs are doing is wrong — just as it was wrong to commit the acts that created the legitimate grievances. There are two possible courses of action available to America — and I sincerely hope you will think long and hard about these two possib ilities: Choice #1: You can try to stamp out the thugs, whic h is impossible, if the history of the world is any guide whatsoever.

Oliver, commander USN (ret.): \"To withdraw tro ops from Iraq would qualify as the greatest surrender in history and invite dir ect attacks here in this country and ultimately drastically change the way we live.\" Let me see if I have this right. Hundreds — if not thousands — more Americans will have to die, thousands more Iraqis will have to die , and we at home will have to cough up hundreds of billions of dollars more out of our poc kets because a thoughtless, insensitive President decided to invade a foreign country witho ut having the good sense to personally check the evidence justifying the invasion. Withdrawing from Iraq would not be \"the greatest su rrender in history.\" The greatest surrender already has occurred — when we surrendere d to the federal government the power to sacrifice our lives and eat away our suste nance — when we allowed one man to put this nation in such jeopardy. Michael Bustamente, Sterling Height, MI: \"Tell you what. We leave and the sanctimonious jerks like you and your Free Press, y ou go there and stay after we leave.\" Sanctimonious = Not wanting to see people die for n o purpose other than to prevent a delusional President from having to admit he made a mistake. Cliff Hair: \"Never heard of Al Neuharth! What makes him so special and who gives a damn what he thinks?\" Apparently you do. Alec Jones, Hoover, AL: \"Nothing more than a unilat eral withdrawal would encourage those who are our enemies and wish to do us harm.\" Do you really believe that keeping American troops in Iraq would discourage \"our enemies\" and cause them to stop wishing to \"do us h arm.\" Perhaps George Bush isn’t the most delusional man in America. Bob Armstrong, Clayton, CA: \"When the Iraqi electio ns are held and they demonstrate a willingness to fight for freedom this will all be worth it.\" You mean it will justify the deaths of upwards of 1 00,000 Iraqis and Americans — probably none of whom considers an election in Iraq to be a worthwhile reward for losing his life?

Fittingly, the inauguration parade route was lined the entire way with armed gu ards — so many armed guards that they had to stand shoulder-to-shoulder. As with the rest of America, Washington, D.C. was in a state of siege."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 455 The militant air of the entire affair was very much like a parade in the old Soviet Union or even in Nazi Germany. And in his speech, George Bush proclaimed his desir e for world domination — to have the power and the right to decide who is good and w ho is bad, who shall live and who shall die, what form of government will exist in ea ch nation. He made it clear that if he has a use for your gove rnment, you will keep it — no matter how oppressive. But if your government doesn't suit him, if it decl ares its independence from the United States, we will \"liberate\" your country and impose what we call \"democracy\" on it — no matter how advanced your civilization, no matter ho w much or how little your people may approve of your current form of government. Of course, by \"we\" he meant George Bush. George Bush is, in effect, the ruler of the world — more powerful than the United Nations, more powerful than the countries of Europe , more powerful than the Congress of the United States, more powerful than the people of the United States — a majority of whom now believe that George Bush was wrong to inva de Iraq. But that majority opinion has no effect on George Bush, who continues to try to impose His way upon Iraq, and who most likely now has His sights on Iran. My Obsession If you’ve been reading my articles or listening to my radio, you may be aware of how much attention I’ve given to this drive for world d omination — dressed up as the \"War on Terror\" and \"Operation Iraqi Freedom.\" I’ve writ ten over and over about these wars. You might say I’m obsessed with war. And you’d be right. I’m obsessed with war because of what war really is . And because of what war is doing to America. Why am I so obsessed? Sacrifice A January 21st editorial in the Wall Street Journal summed up George Bush’s inauguration speech very neatly:"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 456 The entire speech was about Iraq, as a way of expla ining to Americans why the sacrifice our troops are making there is justified. Aye, and there’s the rub. Troops don’t sacrifice. Only individuals can sacrif ice. For some of them, the sacrifice is a year out of their lives. For others, the sacrifice is in living for a year or more in constant fear and danger. But for too many, the sacrifice is one’s life. The loss of one’s whole life. That’s not the same as giving a tenth of your incom e to the church, or working 15 hours a week in a soup kitchen, or spending a day a week he lping out at a nursing home. When you sacrifice your life, you give up everything . The world has ended. What you were no longer exists. No more life, no more love, no more music, no more sports, no more breathing, no more interest in anything. And when you’ve sacrificed your life, it no longer matters whether Iraq is \"liberated\" or oppressed, because you don’t exist any more. It no longer matters whether George Bush is a great leader or a megalomaniac, because you no longer have a life with which to be affected by it. You are no more. George Bush can speak cavalierly about such sacrifi ces. He can say \"freedom is always worth it \" He can speak with gratitude about such s acrifices — because he is making no sacrifice whatsoever. He can tell young people that when you die \"you wil l add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character.\" But he is not the Messiah. He can’t bring those dea d people back to life. He can not restore their ability to taste love, to enjoy fello wship, to pursue a career, to bask in the sheer joy of being alive. He can’t return to a mother her dead son. He can’t return to a wife her dead husband. He can’t bring a dead soldier back to raise his childr en. He can’t do anything to restore what he has stolen from people with his glib assurances about WMDs, mobile bioweapons labs, unmanned planes dropping chemical weapons on the East Coast of the United States, about freedom always being worth the price — a price that to him is effectively zero. The dead are dead, and they can’t come back. They w on’t dance at any inaugural balls — or even attend their alumni reunions.

If he didn’t know that his plan to \"liberate\" peopl e who hadn’t asked to be liberated, to bring democracy to people who hadn’t asked for demo cracy, would lead to the deaths of thousands of people, he is not only incompetent and unfit to hold office, he is surely psychopathic and needs to be incarcerated. Only a psychopath would stand in the midst of thous ands of security guards and speak of \"the force of human freedom.\" Only a man so insulated from the real world by pala ce sycophants, by little Napoleons filled with utopian fantasies, and by callous, ambi tious schemers to whom the lives of others mean nothing — only a man so insulated could possibly speak of \"the expansion of freedom in all the world.\" Only a man with no link to reality could start a wa r that destroys lives and families and then say, \"Every man and woman on this earth has ri ghts, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth.\" Only a snake oil salesman can rain missiles and bom bs on other countries and then say that no \"human being aspires to live at the mercy o f bullies.\" Only a man divorced from human reason can imprison people — possibly for life — without due process of law and then say that \"Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves. ” Only a liar can proclaim that he will decide which countries must be remade and then say, \"No one is fit to be a master, and no one dese rves to be a slave.\" Only a devious schemer can announce a goal of \"endi ng tyranny in our\" while he is imposing a new tyranny in his own country — our country. So you tell me: what kind of a President do we have ? And what has he given us other than wars, fear, and a state of siege? Why the Obsession? Yes, I have become obsessed with these wars.

They were killed by a relatively small group in Was hington who believe they were put there by God to remake the world — not remake it in God’s image, but in Their own.

Should the U.S. Military Be Allowed to Use Torture? by Harry Browne January 11, 2005 As you know, the Bush administration has been under fire for its use of torture — and it has become apparent that torture has pervaded the U .S. military's activities not just at Abu Ghraib, but also in other parts of Iraq, in Afg hanistan, at Guantanamo, and elsewhere. Unfortunately, the argument over the use of torture has focused on whether the nature of terrorism justifies its use: Terrorists do terrible things, so why should they have any"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 460 rights? And why not use torture against terrorists who might be able to provide information that could prevent another terrorist at tack? Opponents of torture answer \"no\" — but they do it o n the grounds that this is contrary to international law (which could open the door to wid er use of torture by our enemies), and that it is inhumane to use torture — even if the pe rson being tortured is a terrorist. In all the arguing over the presumed rights of a te rrorist, one thing is being overlooked: no one knows for sure whether the person being tort ured really is a terrorist . There are three very good reasons we have a 6 th in the Bill of Rights: First, until the accused has had his day in court, until he has had the benefit of an attorney who can call attention to weaknesses in the case ag ainst him, until he has had the opportunity to confront and cross-examine those who have accused him, until his case can be judged by people who don't have a vested int erest in convicting him, no one can be sure the accused is guilty . We already have narratives from people who make a p retty good case that they are entirely innocent, but were captured and arrested b y the U.S., put in jail, denied all contact with counsel or family, and tortured. Second, if the Bill of Rights isn't adhered to, if the accused isn't given the privileges accorded therein, it's too easy to convict the wron g person — thus allowing the guilty party to go free and continue to commit crimes. So the Bill of Righ ts doesn't just protect the rights of the innocent, it is also enhances the security of the community. Third, using torture on prisoners is a poor way to gain information. The moment anyone started to torture me, I'd tell him anything he wan ted to know — even if I didn't know anything. I would confess my crimes immediately — e ven if I had committed no crimes. I would say anything the torturer wanted to hear. B ut of what value is that to him? Absolutely no value at all. In fact, if my statemen ts were believed and people acted on what they \"learned\" from torturing me, they would w aste valuable resources by pursuing false leads. The problem, as so often is the case, comes back to government schools. Because there is virtually no education covering the reasons for the Bill of Rights, very few people in America have an understanding of why we have a Bill of Rights and why it must be enforced without exception — in both civilian courts and in military justice. P.S. To those who say that the Bill of Rights doesn 't apply to non-Americans, I say: read the Bill of Rights. Nowhere does it refer to the ci tizenship of the people affected. The 1st amendment refers to \"Congress,\" the 2nd to \"people, \" the third to \"soldiers,\" the 4th to"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 461 \"people,\" the 5th to \"person,\" the 6th to \"accused, \" the 9th to \"people,\" the 10th to the \"States\" and to the \"people,\" while the 7th and 8th don't refer to any specific entities. The word \"American\" or \"citizen\" appears nowhere in the Bill of Rights. If the government is allowed to suspend the Bill of Rights for anyone , the security of all of us is diminished. P.P.S.

And n o one in his right mind can believe that our government can eliminate every criminal ga ng in the world. If our government could do that, why wouldn’t it st art with the drug gangs that terrorize areas of Washington, D.C.? What a perfect opportuni ty for the politicians to demonstrate their crime-fighting abilities. On October 4, 2001, I wrote: Because the September attacks were a crime, the gov ernment's job is to locate and bring to trial any perpetrators who didn't die in t he attacks. If some of them are located in foreign countries, our government should request extradition — not threaten to bomb the foreign country if we don't ge t our way. I was criticized by some people, who asked, \"But wh at if all the ‘criminals’ aren’t caught\" And yet, here we are four years later, tens of thou sands of people have died, and still not all the criminals have been caught regardless. Osam a Bin Laden not only hasn’t been apprehended, he isn’t even talked about anymore. As I said in: If not all the criminals are found and brought to t rial, it doesn't mean that bombing innocent people would have brought the criminals to justice. So why do the politicians talk about a War on Terro rism that makes no sense? Because it opens the door to all sorts of aggressio ns against foreigners and Americans. And it allows the politicians — most notably the le ading members of the Bush administration — to pose as noble warriors against enemies that are really only Strawmen. Charley Reese, in a recent LewRockwell.com article, quoted Dick Cheney as claiming a U.S. pullout from Iraq would leave it in the hands of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Osama Bin Laden, and/or Ayman al-Zawahiri. Charley points out that \"Zarqawi is a Jordanian, no t an Iraqi; he has been denounced by his tribe and his family; and he has killed more Ir aqis than Americans. It is just a matter of time before some Iraqi drops a dime on him and h e’s packed off to Islamic hell.\" But he’s a worthy Strawman, a bogey man, whose name is worth a hundred million dollars or more in Congressional appropriations."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 463 Charley goes on, \"As for bin Laden and his Egyptian adviser, they are — assuming they’re still alive — hiding out in some cave or ra t-infested village in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. They could not co ntrol a small town, much less a country of 25 million people of which neither of th em is a native.\" As we all know, the U.S. government has since World War II been financing and arming various foreign dictators — such as Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, the Shah of Iran, and others — only to denounce and attack them once they become wealthy and aggressive enough to be worthy Strawmen. It’s also true that the U.S. government has finance d and armed various opposition groups that supposedly represent the opportunity to topple the mean old dictators. Often these groups oppose each other, and engage in violence ag ainst one another. But no matter, the object of our government is to be doing something t o fight a Strawman. Robert Dreyfuss, in another excellent LewRockwell.c om, catalogs a number of the groups that opposed Saddam Hussein and are now batt ling for control of Iraq. There is far more than the Iraqi National Congress. The stronges t groups are SCIRI (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution), Al Dawa (The I slamic Call), SCIRI’s paramilitary arm, the Badr Brigade, the Muslim Brotherhood , rep resented by IIP (the Iraqi Islamic Party) — not to mention Al-Qaeda. The first three o riginated and are based in — guess where — Iran. In fact, SCIRI was founded in 1982 by Ayatollah Khomeini. Today these groups are fighting each other as much as they’re fighting Iraqi insurgents, Americans, or Iraqi civilians. They regularly pract ice torture, assassinations, and other dastardly deeds upon one another. They are fighting to become the rulers of the new Iraq — the \"democracy\" that George Bush claims to be cre ating. Is this what 2,000 Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died for? Is this what $200 billion dollars has financed? Is this why we h ave given up so much of our freedom? And whoever wins the battle to rule Iraq will event ually become Strawmen against whom the Bush administration can get on its horses and r ide off to protect us. There is no War on Terrorism. There is only a War o n Strawmen, a War on Shadows, a War on Fantasies — allowing George Bush to do whate ver he, or his advisors, choose to do. It is time to quit pretending that the War in Iraq serves any purpose relating to world peace, democracy in the Middle East, the first line against terrorism, or any other salutary goal. It is simply part of the War on Strawmen.

Serbia, an independent country, wasn't part of the Empire. Many Serbs (both in Serbia and Bosnia) wanted Serbia to annex Bosnia, but the Austrian Emperor refused to let Bosnia go."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 465 When the Emperor's heir apparent, Archduke Ferdinan d, visited Bosnia, he was shot and killed by a Bosnian Serb. The assassination was a crime, of course, but it wa s committed by just a handful of men. Since Bosnia was part of Austria, it would have bee n a simple matter for Austria to prosecute the assassin and his collaborators. But i nstead the Austrian Emperor accused Serbia's government of arranging the murder, and Au stria mobilized for war against Serbia. At the time, governments inside and outside of Euro pe were joined together in a web of mutual defense treaties, and so a local quarrel bec ame a world war. Britain, France, Belgium, Romania, Greece, Portugal, Montenegro, Rus sia, and even Japan supported Serbia. On the other side, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria , and Turkey supported Austria. The awful war quickly consumed most of Europe. Eventually, 15 million soldiers and civilians would be killed and at least 20 million wounded — all because one person had been assassina ted. What a testament to the irrationality of war. Stalemate After three years of fighting, the two sides were b ogged down in a bloody stalemate — with neither able to gain a decisive advantage. The armies on both sides were exhausted, and Europe ans were ready for an armistice that would stop the terrible bloodshed. Germany put out feelers to end the conflict. If that armistice had materialized in 1917, the his tory of the past 80 years would have been quite different and much happier. There might still be monarchs in Germany, Austria, Belgium, and even Russia. That may be dist asteful to some, but it might have saved the lives of tens of millions of people. With Russia and Germany again at peace, the Germans would have had no reason to help Lenin take over Russia, and the Soviet Union never would have been born. And with the German Emperor still on the throne, Adolf Hitler wo uld never have had the opportunity to seize power. Although no one can say for sure, it seems very unl ikely that there would have been a second World War. And without that war and without a Soviet Union, there would have been no Cold War, no Korean War, no Vietnam War. Th e 20th century wouldn't have been an era of perfect peace, but it would have avo ided being history's bloodiest 100 years. American Intervention Changes History"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 466 But such was not to be. Instead, in 1917, after winning reelection for keep ing America out of the war, Woodrow Wilson pulled America into it — and that interventi on changed history irrevocably for the worse. Millions of fresh American soldiers streamed into E urope — tipping the balance of power and overwhelming an enemy exhausted from thre e years of war. Germany and Austria surrendered, the German emperor fled to the Netherlands, and the Allies imposed devastating conditions upon a defeated Germany. So, instead of a functioning Germany with Kaiser Wi lhelm on the throne, America produced a prostrate Germany eager for revenge. The humanitarian spirit that propelled America into a war to \"end all wars\" laid the groundwork for two of history's worst murderers — J osef Stalin and Adolf Hitler. Could Woodrow Wilson — or anyone else — have forese en all this in advance? No, and that's the point. Once you embark on the us e of force — for any purpose — you have no idea what will fly up out of Pandora's box. Lessons to Be Learned At least, one could learn a lesson from the deaths of 15 million people. In fact, World War I offered two unmistakable lessons: • George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were right t o say America would achieve nothing but ruin by meddling in the ancient quarrels of Europe. • When mutual defense treaties fail to deter wars, as they usually do, they enlarge war and make it bloodier. A mutual def ense treaty easily becomes a mutual suicide pact. Unfortunately, memories are short, and history seem s to be such a dull subject. So when the politicians tell us we have a chance to bring about world peace if we just send more of our children to die, or just bomb more innocent civilians overseas, or just bully a few more smaller countries, many people don 't realize they are listening to a story that has been told many times before — and seldom p roduced a happy ending. THE PERMANENT WAR FOOTING"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 467 America returned to peace and independent policies after World War I. But after World War II our government enmeshed itself in mutual def ense treaties all over the world, put us on a permanent war footing, undertook numerous m ilitary adventures, and took sides in almost everyone's conflicts — much of which acti vity had little to do with the Soviet threat. Here are a few examples: • In the 1980s our government sent military equipment to Iraq's Saddam Hussein to help him fight the Ayatollah in I ran. Much of the American equipment was used in 1990 to help Ira q invade Kuwait. So our children were sent to Iraq to depose our one-time ally Saddam Hussein — now described by our politici ans as a modern Hitler. However, even after the U.S. killed thousands of civilians and soldiers, Hussein remained in power. • Our government enlisted Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in the fight against communism. But in 1989 the U.S. m ilitary invaded Panama, killed a number of people, kidnapped Norieg a, took him to Florida, and imprisoned him — supposedly to stop th e use of Panama as a relay station for the drug trade. Norie ga still sits in a U.S. prison, but there's no indication that the dru g flow through Panama has abated. In fact, the drug cartels of Sou th America move freely into Panama because America destroyed Panama 's army in 1989. • American politicians went to the Philippines to mon itor elections, pressure the Philippine people to get rid of Ferdin and Marcos, and end corruption. Marcos lost the election, but corru ption is as rampant in the Philippines today as it was then — a nd the subject no longer seems to interest American politicians. • Our government bombed Libya in 1986, killing a numb er of civilians, to force Muammar Khadaffi to end his sup port for terrorists. But two years after our government supp osedly taught Khadaffi a lesson, a bomb destroyed a Pan American Airlines flight over Scotland, killing 259 people — and our governm ent says Khadaffi was responsible. • During the 1980s our government helped the \"freedom fighters\" take power in Afghanistan. In 1998 our government b ombed those same Afghans, claiming they were now harboring terr orists."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 468 • In Rwanda, Somalia, Bosnia — wherever our governmen t has meddled — the only consistent outcomes have been Am erican deaths, American tax dollars wasted, the sacrifice of thousands of innocent foreigners, and no lasting solution. In country after country, American intervention eit her failed to achieve its objective or succeeded in making matters worse. A DANGEROUS WORLD Because America has taken sides in so many conflict s, because America has armed so many countries' enemies, because America has impose d so many \"solutions\" on so many people, because American troops occupy so many coun tries, the world has become dangerous for America. Foreigners generally love McDonald's but hate our g overnment. Foreign politicians exploit that hatred. And now and then foreign terro rists try — or pretend to try — to change our government's polices by bombing American targets here or abroad. But our policies don't change, because politicians never respond to problems by letting go of their power. So, instead of doing something to e liminate the motive for actual or threatened terrorism, our politicians \"fight\" it wi th even more foreign adventures. And they issue a steady stream of alarms about frig htening problems around the world — all of which supposedly require our immediate atten tion and intervention. But why should we have anything to fear? Our countr y is bounded by two friendly nations and two oceans that protect us from invasio n. We are open only to the sky. Our first military concern should be to defend ourselve s against missiles launched from overseas. Weak Defense And therein lies the rub. Today we have a very strong national offense, but a very weak national defense. American taxpayers have coughed up trillions of dol lars for the military since World War II — giving the politicians the power to destroy an y country in the world. But we are still almost completely helpless before any dictator who decides to lob a low-budget missile at your city."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 469 The basic technology to defend against incoming mis siles has been available for close to 30 years, and perfecting and implementing it become s easier every year. But by leaving us vulnerable, the politicians can justify more pow er for themselves. They tell us we must arm ourselves to the teeth wit h weapons that can threaten any would-be attacker with annihilation. We must statio n American troops in nearly a hundred countries around the world, as though your children were a Roman army of occupation. We must intervene in every foreign disp ute to prevent it from escalating into a wider war. We must react with fright when India o r Pakistan tests a nuclear weapon. We must intimidate other countries and impose our \" solutions\" upon them. And although the Cold War is over, we must continue to support a huge, bureaucratic Defense Department and military. In reality, we need only two things to make you, me , and every American safe from the world's turmoil: (1) a missile defense that will re pel a nuclear attack, and (2) a border patrol that will protect us from those rampaging Ca nadians when they charge across the border from Ontario. With a proper defense against incoming missiles, we 'd have no need to intimidate the world with offensive missiles — threatening to kill millions of civilians in an aggressor country. We'd have no reason to bomb Serbia, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Sudan, or any other country — and then give it billions of dollars to r epair the damage. Instead, we could let others nurse their age-old grievances they seem to love so much — knowing that their problems can't hurt us. Mutual Suicide And even without a missile defense, we have no need to participate in NATO, the United Nations, or any other foreign agency that wants to bind you and me to its decisions. And there is no reason to risk disaster with mutual def ense treaties. (Or do you really believe Turkey and Italy will rush to help us if we're atta cked?) Our federal government was formed to protect Americ ans, not foreigners. If we're responsible for the defense of Europe, wha t are the Europeans responsible for — the defense of Asia? POLITICIANS & DEATH War is justified by blurring the distinction betwee n foreign rulers and their subjects. Our politicians cite the sins of foreign rulers, and th en ask us to join in killing their downtrodden subjects."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 470 The politicians want us to forget that wars and \"po lice actions\" kill innocent people. They talk about teaching a foreign dictator a lesson, bu t the dictator never gets hurt. Instead, American bombs kill thousands of innocent civilians who may hate the dictator even more than our politicians claim to. For example, since the Gulf War in 1991, our govern ment has brow-beaten other governments to ban trade with Iraq — in order to fo rce Saddam Hussein from power. In the eight years of trade sanctions through 1999, it is estimated that at least 1,700,000 Iraqi civilians have died for lack of imported foreign fo od and medicine. And, although it doesn't seem to make the newspaper s very often, from time to time American planes continue to drop bombs on innocent Iraqi civilians. Politicians call the deaths of the innocent \"collat eral damage.\" And President Clinton and the Republican Congress have steadfastly supported the policy of starving and bombing, even though it has achieved nothing but death and d isease. And after ten years of delivering death by air frei ght, the U.S. has left Saddam Hussein still firmly entrenched in power. But American poli ticians never admit the failure or cruelty of their policies — or even discuss the mat ter. The war against Serbia in 1999 was little different . When it ended, the hated Slobodan Milosevic was still ruling the country. And it beca me apparent that American bombing had done little to cripple Serbia's military. But h undreds, and maybe thousands, of civilians died — including many of the Albanian civ ilians who supposedly were the objects of our government's \"humanitarian\" mission. Isn't there a better way? SOLUTIONS Yes, there is. Like the Founding Fathers, Libertarians know that w ar is the first resort of political scoundrels, but the last resort of a free people. L ibertarians know that government's role isn't to police the world — or even to win wars. Go vernment's role is to keep us out of wars — and to protect us from foreign enemies, not create them. How would a Libertarian government assure our safet y? Our foreign policy would be simple: We are always ready to defend ourselves, but we thr eaten no one. America's foreign policy should rest on four princi ples."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 471 1. Non-Interference Our government should express good will and a desir e for peace toward all — threatening no foreign country, interfering in no o ther countries' disputes, arming or aiding no foreign governments, and giving terrorist s no motivation to influence our government. Any American who wants to volunteer to a foreign go vernment to fight in its war, to negotiate its peace, or to send money to help defen d it should be free to do so with no interference from the U.S. government. But no American should be forced to participate in or pay for such activities. And our politicians should quit committing Americans to the se futile attempts to settle other people's problems. When the politicians drag us off to someone else's war, they always offer plenty of reasons — too many, in fact, to be taken seriously. The typical menu of justifications for a single intervention might be: We must interfere t o keep the conflict from spreading, to head off the emergence of a new Hitler, to protect our allies, to do the moral thing, and to end violations of human rights. But how can our politicians protect human rights in other countries? They don't even respect our rights. They try to disarm you, they allow the pol ice to invade your life and property, they use the insane War on Drugs to impos e police-state surveillance on all of us, and they try to censor the Internet. So how can they claim to care about human rights in other nations? 2. No Foreign Aid or Military Assistance The Constitution grants our government no authority to take your money to support foreign governments. Not only is it unconstitutional, it is unfair by al most any standard. Little of the money reaches the average citizen in the target country. Most of it enriches the rulers — and it helps them stay in power and continue the policies that keep their countries poor. As Fred L. Smith pointed out, foreign aid taxes poo r people in rich countries for the benefit of rich people in poor countries. Foreign aid originally was justified as a way of ar ming countries against Communist encroachment. But Cuba, China, and Vietnam all fell to the Communists after receiving massive amounts of American money and weapons. In f act, much of the military equipment given to fight the Communists eventually fell into their hands."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 472 So the politicians no longer bother trying to justi fy giving your money to foreign governments. They just do it. And, not surprisingly , most of the money has strings attached — requiring that it be spent with politica lly connected industries in the U.S. Much foreign aid is spent to fix problems that migh t not exist but for our government. For example, many Americans understandably worry ab out Israel's security, fearing that without American aid Israel will be overrun by its neighbors. But the most effective thing our government could do to help Israel would be to stop arming Israel's enemies . Our government's eagerness to take sides in Middle East disputes has put billions of dollars of weapons in the hands of Saudi Arabia, Sy ria, Iraq, and Iran. Small wonder that it seems necessary to rush to Israel's defense when hostile governments can use American weapons to intimidate Israel. Every American should be free to send money or weap ons to Israel or any other government in the world. But our government has no business taxing you for the benefit of any foreign government. 3. Security against Attack Are there bad people in the world who would conquer America if they could? Most likely, there are. But how would they do it? They would have to pulverize American cities to the point that we submit to an invasion and occupation. Or they would have to threaten to p ulverize us and be believed. In other words, all we have to fear are incoming mi ssiles. In 1983 Ronald Reagan made the most sensible milita ry suggestion of the past 50 years — that America should have protection against missi le attacks. Unfortunately, he assigned the job to the Department of Defense, and now — 17 years later — we are no closer to being protected than we were then. The Constitution asks the federal government to def end the nation. But we should rely as little as possible on the political and bureaucrati c worlds if we want to achieve anything useful. Instead, we should look to those who know h ow to solve problems and can be motivated to do so by the lure of big profits. The government should simply post a reward — say, $ 25 billion — to be given to the first private company that can produce a working, f unctioning, fool-proof missile defense. Not a prototype, not a plan, not a cost-pl us contract — but a demonstration of the actual system successfully bringing down missil es. If such an offer were made, we probably would have a missile defense within five y ears."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 473 Remember all the reasons given in 1997 that the Y2K computer problem couldn't possibly be solved by 2000? Even many computer expe rts said there wasn't enough time, there weren't enough programmers, and there were to o many lines of computer code to be examined, altered, and tested. But somehow, people in search of profits found ways to overcome all the barriers and reduce the problem to a minor inconvenience. In the same way, private firms competing to win a h uge reward will achieve missile- defense goals that bureaucrats (and even scientists ) working for the government might consider impossible. Even the companies that don't win the race can prof it if they find the answers eventually — by selling them to other governments that want pr otection from terrorist missiles. What if the missile-defense technology fell into th e hands of a savage dictator? That would pose no threat to us. We shouldn't be afraid of any country's ability to defend itself — only afraid of our inability to defend America. When India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons, the re was nothing the U.S. could realistically do about it, short of bombing or inva ding them. None of our government's admonitions could change anything, so our politicia ns should have kept their mouths shut. If we had a missile defense, such nuclear tests wou ldn't frighten us. We can't prevent other nations from fighting each other or developin g weapons of mass destruction, but we can make sure their disputes and their deadly arms don't reach us. Will a missile defense make us perfectly secure? Of course not. But neither will any other policy. What a missile defense will do is make us far safer than we are today, elimina te the excuses for meddling in other countries' affairs, a nd remove one big reason for taxing us so heavily. 4. Target the Aggressors, Not the Innocent Suppose that, even with a missile defense, America truly were threatened by a foreign ruler. A Libertarian President would target the ruler hims elf. He wouldn't order bombers to kill the ruler's innocent subjects. A Libertarian President would warn the ruler that a ny actual attack would be met by the offer of a mega-reward to anyone who could kill the ruler. Everyone would be eligible to"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 474 collect the reward, including the ruler's guards an d wives. And the reward would be very big — perhaps $100 million or more. Would this prompt the foreign ruler to respond by p utting a price on the head of the Libertarian President? Possibly. But anything the U.S. President does to interfere with the rule r's plans could provoke an assassination attempt. Posting a reward for the dic tator's death wouldn't add to the risk. In addition to sparing innocent people in foreign c ountries, the assassination response would spare innocent Americans. Only those who want to try for the reward would be at risk. Americans wouldn't be drafted to fight and di e invading a foreign country. And Americans wouldn't be taxed to pay for volunteers. Please understand the limits of this proposal. It i sn't a way to force dictators to change their spots or accommodate the U.S. It is only a me ans to prevent a direct attack on America. If the dictator withdraws his threat, the U.S. would withdraw the reward. If our government followed a libertarian foreign po licy, it's unlikely that any foreign ruler would want to threaten us. So it's unlikely that an y such reward would ever be posted. But if a foreign ruler were tempted to threaten us, the fear of assassination would be more likely to deter him than the fear of losing some of his civilian subjects to U.S. bombs. If you don't believe that's true, if you think assa ssination isn't nice, what is the alternative? Is it to kill thousands of innocent fo reigners and to assure the deaths of innocent Americans? That to me is the cruelest, most reckless approach. DO WE TRUST GOVERNMENT TO MAKE US SAFE? Those who tell us America can bring peace and democ racy to the world don't seem to recognize that they're talking about the same Ameri can government that can't keep the streets safe in Washington, D.C. It's the same gove rnment that bleeds us with taxes, pits group against group in battles over quotas and priv ileges, and has devastated our cities with a futile War on Drugs. If it fails to achieve any of its domestic goals, i f it imposes alien values on its own people, why should you expect it to attain lofty goals over seas? Politics Is Usual And don't forget: we're talking about the governmen t, after all."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 475 Military decisions are made politically — just as n ew pork-barrel projects are chosen politically. The government's foreign policy is det ermined with reference to polls, voting blocs, rewards, and punishment. For example, Bill C linton sent troops to Haiti in 1994, killing people along the way, just to gain the supp ort of the Congressional Black Caucus for his domestic political agenda. It's easy to imagine how our government could inter vene to bring peace to some foreign region or to support \"American interests\" overseas. But the actual policy will never be the one you imagine, implemented in the way you envisio n. Instead, the politicians will define those interests by relying for \"counsel\" on those who have the most political influence. To expect foreign policy decisions somehow to be se parated from politics is as unrealistic as to expect politicians to refrain from buying vot es with your tax money. In short, foreign policy is as much a political boo ndoggle as any other government project. So be careful what you urge the politician s to do. PEACE FOR ALL TIME When America can defend itself against missile atta ck, the politicians will lose their best excuse for butting into the affairs of other countr ies and making demands upon you. That's probably why so little has been done to cons truct such a defense. But it should be the first priority of anyone who p ledges to support and defend the Constitution and the American people. And when our government no longer interferes in oth er countries with military adventures and foreign aid, foreign terrorists will have little reason to threaten your city. If in spite of these policies, some foreign leader still tries to make trouble for America, we should target the foreign leader for assassinati on, not target innocent civilians for bombing. But I doubt that an American government th at minds its own business and provides a secure defense will ever have to resort to assassination. These policies don't appeal to Democratic and Repub lican politicians, who see foreign crises as opportunities for greater power and more government spending, who demonstrate their courage by sacrificing the lives of others, and who see clearly what we too easily forget — that \"war\" is just another word for \"big government,\" a way to make politicians more important. The policies I've outlined should make it possible to defend this country successfully for no more than $50 billion a year — contrasted with o ur current vulnerability, which costs"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 476 nearly $300 billion a year. In 1952, at the height of the Cold War and the Korean War, the federal government spent less than $50 billion a year on the military. But, more important than the savings in taxes, you will know that your children will never fight and die in a foreign war — and terroris ts will never target your city. Finally, we will have a strong national defense, in stead of a strong national offense. ENFORCING PEACE The U.S. Constitution was the best attempt ever mad e to limit the power of government. But because it wasn't self-enforcing, the politicia ns eventually found that they could ignore it with impunity. I believe we need a new Constitutional amendment to restrain the politicians' ability to draw us into war. Here is my proposal: Section 1. The United States shall be at war only after a dec laration of war, naming the specific enemy nations, is approved by t he President and by a two-thirds vote of the eligible members in both hou ses of Congress. Section 2 . The members of the House of Representatives and t he Senate eligible to vote on a declaration of war are those who are between the ages of 18 and 35, or who have children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren between those ages. Section 3 . In the absence of a Congressional declaration of war, the President may deploy the military to repel an armed invasion of the United States, but may not deploy troops or engage in host ilities outside the United States. Section 4 . The United States shall enter into no treaty with any nation or organization if such treaty could oblige the United States to be at war without a declaration of war by Congress, and the U nited States shall not be bound to engage in war by any action taken by an y organization of which they are a member. Section 5 . Except in time of war, as specified in Section 1, the United States will provide no weapons or other resources t o foreign governments, will engage in no military action outside the borde rs of the United States, and shall deploy no military personnel or weapons o utside the boundaries of the United States except that at any one time up to one thousand members of the military may be outside the United S tates for no longer than thirty days."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Browne/The War Racket, Part II 477 Section 6 . Upon any violation of this article by the Preside nt, Congress shall institute impeachment proceedings within 14 d ays. Section 4 doesn't preclude a missile defense or any other kind of defense of this nation. It only requires the President to wait before attackin g a foreign nation until a declaration of war has been issued. Even if some incapacity preven ts Congress from making a declaration quickly, America could still defend its elf. It just couldn't attack anyone else. This amendment is, I believe, an important first st ep in finding a way to keep politicians away from loaded weapons forever. That's the one ki nd of gun control that really will save lives.
