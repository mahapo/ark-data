By the end of the 1970s Harry had come to the concl usion that forecasts were pretty useless. He said, \"If the world is running out of trees, it is because so many people have used so much paper to write so man y words about so many inevitable events that never ca me to pass.\" In March 1980, he wrote \"Forecasting vs. Strategy,\" in which he said that profits come from a good strategy, rat her than accurate forecasts. As the decades progressed he be came progressively more anti-prediction. And he publishe d many full-length articles explaining why it’s impossible to predict human action — no matter how simple it may seem. This book contains 16 of those articles that discus s Harry’s investment strategy. They contain perceptive explan ations that debunk so much of what passes for investment w isdom — plus intelligent comments about life. Most of all , the main thrust of the articles is a step-by-step analysis o f how you can deal with an uncertain world — without preconceptio ns or dogma. These articles will remind you of something you lea rned a long time ago – that the future is unknowable. They will also reassure you that you don't have to rely on fortune tellers to deal successfully with any part of you life -- incl uding your investments. And they’re written in Harry's patente d easy-to- follow style, sprinkled with his good humor."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 6 Although these articles were written in the 1980s a nd 1990s, they contain ideas that are timeless – ideas that c an help you today to separate sound investment advice from slog ans masquerading as insight.

Over the succeeding 22½ years, the newsletter publi shed investment analysis, investment suggestions, political comment ary, alleged humor, investment crossword puzzles, explanations o f esoteric economic and investment subjects, analyses of the i nvestment implications of numerous new tax laws, graphs and m ore graphs, a contest to guess in advance the date of the Mexican peso devaluation and one for the Japanese stock-market crash, tables of weekly investment prices, news summaries, examples of faul ty press reporting about the economy and investments, quotat ions from others on politics and investing, refutations of common in vestment and political clichés, apologies for typos and late iss ues and late articles, and assorted persiflage. During that time there were very few predictions or forecasts, almost no self-congratulations, no pictures of trendlines or head-and- shoulders patterns, no information from well-placed sources, no sure things, and less than enough discipline. 3 Phases The newsletter evolved through three phases. The first was from 1974 to 1978, when it was concer ned almost entirely with hard-money investments and the deteri orating state of the U.S. economy. The second, from 1978 to 1986, was a transition pha se — from a preoccupation with hard-money investments and thoug hts of a dismal"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 8 future toward the current complete reliance on a ba lanced Permanent Portfolio. The third, starting in 1987, has been a period rely ing solely on the Permanent Portfolio — with constant warnings agains t thinking some plausible story could tell you how to time your inv estments —how to know when gold was going to rise or the stock marke t was going to fall. Phase I: The Hard Money Newsletter, 1974 – 1977 HBSR wasn’t the first hard-money newsletter. When w e began on December 24, 1974, such eminent hard-money writers as Harry Schultz, C.V. Myers, James Dines, Jerome Smith, and Franz Pick had already been in business for years. And Richard Rus sell, while not known for hard-money views at the time, had been pu blishing for over a decade before we started HBSR. In the newsletter’s first phase, the content was he avy on such matters as privacy, Swiss banks, silver statistics, news of Switzerland and its economy, cost-of-living indices worldwide, tables s howing the gold backing of major currencies, retreats, how to obtai n Swiss residency, and other topics that might have seemed exotic — or even kooky — to the average investor. Phase II: The Transition, 1977 – 1986 Starting in 1977, I tried to look ahead to the end of the hard-money era. We had already introduced Terry Coxon’s idea of usi ng warrants as a low-cost way of being able to profit if a bull mark et in stocks caught us by surprise. And in December 1977 the first rudi mentary version of the Permanent Portfolio was presented. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 9 It wasn’t called a Permanent Portfolio; it was a si ngle portfolio that contained several permanent elements, but included a section for short-term investments. Then in November 1978 the t wo-portfolio concept was introduced — with the names Permanent P ortfolio and Variable Portfolio . In its first incarnation, the Permanent Portfolio w as simply a long- term portfolio — meant to include whatever you expe cted would do well over a period of many years. The Variable Port folio was a short- term portfolio, acting on what you expected to happ en in the near future. The idea was that the Permanent Portfolio would hol d long-term positions in the hard-money investments, with some hedges — while the Variable Portfolio would get you into bull mark ets in gold or stocks or whatever the near-term outlook seemed to warrant. But the tone of the newsletter was definitely chang ing: for the first time, for example, Treasury bonds and bills were co nsidered legitimate investments. As the 1980s began, with Terry Coxon’s help I devel oped a more open attitude. And he and I offered a set of sample Permanent Portfolios that allowed each investor to act on his own expectations — whether for prosperity, level inflation, rising inf lation, runaway inflation, deflation, or “I don’t know.” Eventually , the “I don’t know” portfolio was the only one I’d discuss. Back in the late 1970s, however, the hard-money era was still alive and thriving. 1979 and 1980 were the most exciting investment years any of us is ever likely to see. Gold started 1979 at $226 but was at $850 by January 1980, and then back down to $481 by March 1980. Silver began 1979 at $6.07, shot up to $48 in Janua ry 1980, and was down to $10.80 by May 1980. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 10 During 1979, living in Zürich, I used to wake up in the early afternoon and check the Reuters screen sitting by my bed — to see how high gold had risen at the New York opening — and how mu ch money I’d made while asleep. Ah, those were the days. But it was obvious that this couldn’t go on forever . And in January 1980, in issue 39, we published “Far ewell to Silver” (excerpts below) — at a time when silver was in the mid-$30s. And in April 1981, I wrote that the legendary silve r shortage had disappeared — so that we shouldn’t expect ever agai n to see a silver bull market like that of the 1980s. And although I never gave up on gold for the Perman ent Portfolio, I knew in 1980 that the big move was over. Short-term holdings of gold were sold at prices around $600 in the Spring of 19 80. We had already dropped out of the Swiss franc at $.50 in 1978. In March 1981 we published, “Hard Money Investments — The Wave of th e Past.” Of course, in true newsletter fashion I’m giving yo u only the good news. I won’t go into our adventures with put optio ns, Treasury bonds, and a half-dozen other ill-fated, short-term speculations. By the end of the 1970s I had come to the conclusio n that forecasts were pretty useless. In March 1980, I wrote “Foreca sting vs. Strategy,” in which I said that profits come from a good strategy, rather than accurate forecasts. And as the decade p rogressed I became progressively more anti-prediction. We published many full-length articles attempting t o explain why it’s impossible to predict human action — no matter how simple it may seem. And as writers continued to send forth more a nd more predictions, I took to publishing their prior year’ s predictions (without identifying them by name) — in order to throw cold water on the new ones."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 11 Phase III: the Permanent Portfolio Strategy, 1987 – The Permanent Portfolio reached its present shape i n 1987, when I, at first, intended to update my recommendations of a f ew years before. Instead I realized that it made no sense to offer a nything but a single portfolio that could protect you no matter what may come. By this time I was a complete agnostic as to the fu ture — and an almost-complete agnostic with regard to investment analysis, hanging on only to a few strands of fundamental and technic al analysis that broke not too long afterward. However, I continued to keep a model Variable Portfolio and made suggestions until 1994. After that I continued to encourage readers to bet on anything t hat seemed attractive to them — so long as they did it with mo ney they could afford to lose. VITAL STATISTICS Over 22½ years, the newsletter has contained 5,054 pages — an average of 26 an issue. The shortest issue was only 8 pages (issue #40 in March 1980), and the longest was 54 pages (issue #54 in October 1981). I originally resisted the idea of writing a newslet ter because I didn’t want to be bound by deadlines and have to write som ething when I had nothing to say. The publishers suggested making the newsletter’s frequency irregular, so that we would send out issu es only as warranted. Each subscription was for 10 issues, not a calendar period. The interval between issues ranged from one week (in 19 75) and 17 weeks (in 1976) — averaging 6 weeks. The time it took to fulfill a 10-issue subscription ranged from 11 months to 19 months, av eraging 14 months. There was an average of 8½ issues published per year. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 12 MY WRITING As I read through the first 190 issues in preparati on for this final issue, I was impressed with how good some of the writing w as — incisive, uniquely appropriate, original, entertaining, and i nformative. I read many things I had completely forgotten and was glad to be reminded of. But I also was embarrassed as I reread a number of things I’ve written. Some of it is naïve, some of it completely inappropriate for an investment newsletter, some of it even immature to my 1997 years. There were perceptive explanations that debunked so much of what passes for investment wisdom — plus intelligent com ments about politics and life. Most of all, the main thrust of the past decade has been a step-by-step analysis of how you can deal wi th an uncertain world — without preconceptions or dogma. Alongside this useful wisdom, however, was a certai n amount of meaningless dribble about the possibilities for the economy and investment markets — a lot of earnest words signify ing nothing. I’ve always felt there were five subjects about whi ch people pontificate knowingly and endlessly without any rea l knowledge — politics, psychiatry, investments, diet, and exerci se. Perhaps it’s fitting that as I reduce my investment writing, I will incr ease my political writing. 1 There are some examples later in this article of my concern about the endless investment talk that leads to nothing subst antial. If the world is running out of trees, it is because so many peop le have used so much paper to write so many words about so many ine vitable events that never came to pass.   1 Check the bookstores for the debut of my new book H ow a Permanent Portfolio Can Bring You Physical & Mental Health, E xtreme Wealth, Personal Liberty, & Washboard Abs ."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 13 Even though I haven’t been alone in talking about w hat can’t possibly be known, I still regret wasting so much of my own time and the readers’ time in conjecture about things that might or might not ever come to pass. The wonderful thing about being a writer is that wh at you do lives on long past the time you do it. The bad thing about b eing a writer is that what you do lives on long past the time you do it. STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES I’m probably the least objective person to be appra ising the newsletter’s strengths and weaknesses, but if I ope n the door to others to write this article, who knows what indignities I might suffer? As I look through the back issues, I see some trait s that must have driven many subscribers to distraction: • Issues that took many weeks to show up. This was pa rtly caused by one of the newsletter’s strengths, as des cribed later, but it must have been nerve-wracking if you had a speculative investment that wasn’t doing well and y ou weren’t hearing from the fellow who had led you int o it. • Apologies for late issues and articles promised but not delivered. I knew I shouldn’t announce articles in advance, but I couldn’t seem to keep my mouth shut. • A multitude of corrections of typos or incomplete information. • New features added with great fanfare, only to be d ropped not too much later without a toot. • The repetition of the same points over and over aga in — the idea that gold will never enter a major bull market so long as inflation remains subdued, the constant harping tha t the only way you can rest assured you’re covered is with a Permanent Portfolio, and on and on and on. But I also see many strengths that were unique to t he newsletter: • Detailed instructions for making every investment suggested."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 14 • Scrupulous attention to the transaction costs and a ctual purchase/sale date of each suggested investment, so that the reported performance results were realistic. 1 • More than a perfunctory respect for risk. Instead o f guessing how low an investment might go, we set stop-losses on all Variable Portfolio investments and tried to recogni ze every way that a speculation could go wrong. • Detailed explanations of activities in the investme nt world — how governments intervene in the currency market; how trusts operate; what derivatives are and what disti nguishes whether they are investments or speculations; how d ollars held through foreign banks are actually held in the U.S.; and so on. • Answers to hundreds of questions posed by subscribe rs. • Making sure I could prove any of my assumptions — n o matter how popular the assumptions — which led in s ome cases to changing my mind. Sometimes this checking led me down paths of analysis that caused newsletter issue s to be published later — or even much later — than I’d exp ected. • Careful, considerate writing — thanks in part to th e world’s best editor — that always made sure the reader coul d follow, understand, and enjoy what was written. • Graphs that clearly showed and explained the histor y of an investment or economic indicator, so that one didn’ t have to be an experienced chart-reader to follow them. • The repetition of the same points over and over aga in — the idea that gold will never enter a major bull market so long as inflation remains subdued, the constant harping tha t the only way you can rest assured you’re covered is with a Permanent Portfolio, and on and on and on. Maybe th ey sunk in eventually. Warnings   1 Prior to the stock market crash on Monday, October 19, 1987, the Variable Portfolio was partly invested in mutual funds. I had instructed readers to sell as soon the NYSE Exchange Composite Index closed at 170 or less. That happened on Thursday, O ctober 15, 1987. Since this applied only to active Variable Portfolio speculators, we assume most of t hem were aware of the signal and sold their mutual funds on Friday, October 16 — prior to the Monday c rash. However, we had a policy of crediting purchases and sales two market days after any signa l was given. So we posted the Variable Portfolio’s sale on the day of the crash. This put us in the ironic position of publishing a poorer performance record than the newsletter rating services gave us."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 15 From the beginning, the newsletter dealt in warning s. But these have stepped up considerably in the last ten years or so — as I attempted to keep you from forsaking a balance d, safe portfolio in favor of someone’s idea of a sure thing or someone’ s misguided thought that a particular kind of event — whether a crisis or a boom — was inevitable. There were cautions against: • Accepting the common clichés of the investment worl d; • Believing that silver was going to $100; • Betting all you have on runaway inflation, deflatio n, or any other scenario; • Investing in things you don’t understand but sound good; • Keeping too much of your wealth in any one investme nt, in any one country, or with any single institution; • Treating as fact what financial reporters write; • Worrying about the Depression of 1990 or Bankruptcy 1995; • Believing that the U.S. government will be allowed to peek into your Swiss bank account; • Being beguiled by trading systems, moving averages, waves, Fibonacci numbers, numerology, Gann squares, or Tar ot cards; • Paying any attention to the Kondratieff Wave; • Expecting gold to profit from any world crisis if i t isn’t already in a bull market caused by rising U.S. infl ation; • Believing that the Arabs, the Japanese, a united Eu rope, or China posed a threat to America’s economic future; • Taking seriously the “new currency” scare; • Believing the dollar is going to die; • Treating the U.S. trade deficit, the decline of man ufacturing, or the “debtor nation” scare as anything other than a non- problem; • Excluding bonds from your portfolio in the 1980s or excluding gold from your portfolio in the 1990s;"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 16 • The idea that insider trading or program trading wa s a threat to the financial markets, or that Michael Milken wa s your enemy — when, in fact, all three served to make the investment markets more efficient. I feel like a fireman who has run to put out 2,000 fires — and who hasn’t always succeeded. The 190 issues attempted to refute a multitude of s tatements from people who explained why, for example, gold at $375 had to rise or the Dow at 3,000 had to collapse. The failure of such alarms to materialize into anyt hing real or profitable never dissuades the alarmists from conti nuing to come up with new reasons that, for example, gold at $325 ha s to rise or the Dow at 7,000 has to collapse. 2 During the past two decades I’ve received scores of letters from subscribers recounting someone’s plausible story ex plaining the inevitability of some coming crisis or “explosive” bull market, or detailing a sure-fire indicator or trading system. My job has been to point out that nothing like this has worked out bef ore (which should inspire you to be very skeptical that this idea wil l), and go on to explain the specific fallacies that doom this parti cular sure-thing to failure. One article (“The Great Inflation-Deflation Debate” in 1984) listed 22 arguments that had been floated in the investment w orld to demonstrate that a return of severe inflation was i mminent and inevitable, plus 26 arguments showing that deflatio n was just around   2 Throughout almost the entire life of the newsletter , my policy has been to withhold the name of any writer I criticize if he’s in the investment newsletter business (to protect the guilty), while identifying anyone whose views I quote approvingly (to praise the innocent). I have, however, identified the authors of all political statements and all articles I’ve quoted from the fi nancial press. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 17 the corner. A rebuttal was given for each of the 48 arguments. It’s a dirty job but someone has to make money doing it. Repetition Having answered some of the same questions — such a s on the supposed dangers of a new currency or central banks selling gold — so many times, I no longer give a thought when I co me across a question I’ve answered before. Thus I wasn’t amazed when I read through all the is sues this past week and discovered that two questions answered in issue 186 had already been answered in issue 185. AND NOW, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO . . . I looked back through the 5,000 pages of the first 190 issues for excerpts that were typical of various facets of the newsletter. I pulled out enough to fill several articles the size of thi s one. I’ve pruned it down to what I hope you’ll consider a manageable si ze. I wish it could be more — not because I’m proud of it all, but beca use I think most of these items concern matters that an intelligent inv estor should think about. Here, then, is a sampling of remarks from 190 issue s and 22 years of Harry Browne's Special Reports . The items are just as originally published, except that most of them have been cut s o as to fit them all in. For long-term subscribers these excerpts can serve as reminders of important points. For newer subscribers or non-subs cribers, I hope this summary of a unique approach will help you see your investments in a new light — one that will make it easier for y ou to deal with an"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 18 uncertain world. And to keep it from being too grim ly serious, it’s all interspersed with some fluff that I hope will enter tain you. 4 The Economy, Government, & Society From its inception, the newsletter included a large amount of economic and political commentary — some of it rela ted directly to investments, while other comments were just spoutin g off. Of course, as with investment commentary, a good deal of it no w seems naïve and irrelevant. But here are some items that I hope remain instructive today. BASHING SCROOGE December 3, 1986 TV Guide , in its November 22-28 issue, had this to say: Jeers to Wall Street Week panelist Martin Zweig . . . he asked a guest expert who predicted a devastating epidemic o f AIDS to recommend some stocks that might go up as a result. It’s enough to give capitalism a bad name. This is another example of the warped view that man y people have of investors, investing, and the markets. It’s fun to be holier than thou, and to picture Mr. Zweig as just a heartless money-grubber. But it isn’t very enlighte ning. . . . If TV Guide really believed that no one should profit from the misery of others, it would stop selling magazines that ref er to AIDS, poverty, or other national problems. Fortunately, neither TV Guide nor any other publication does believe that, and so we have the benefit of what they publish.   4 In most cases, these are excerpts from longer artic les. You can obtain a complete copy of any issue for $15 by call ing the newsletter office at (800) 531-5142 or (512) 453-7313."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 19 We also have the benefit of investors with capital. Diseases like AIDS can be defeated fastest if profit-seeking investors put capital into the companies that are working on cures. And the more i nvestors know about the prospects of companies, the more efficien tly the capital can be distributed. Individuals pursuing their own self-interest wind u p helping others. And that’s what gives capitalism a good name. INSIDERGATE May 6, 1987 The whole discussion of insider trading tends to ge t muddied by the unspoken assumption that investors have a “right” t o a certain kind of treatment. Why do they? When people think about dealing with any company, t hey accept the company as it is — and decide whether or not to do business with it. They should approach investing in the same way. The New York Stock Exchange doesn’t owe anyone a li ving, a profit, a “level-playing field,” or anything else. People w ho don’t like the rules shouldn’t play the game. There are plenty of other markets in the world. And if it happens that most of the markets o perate in much the same way, it isn’t because there’s a conspiracy amo ng them; it’s because that’s the only system known to work. The surest way to destroy the financial markets is to have the government guarantee that everyone gets what the go vernment believes is fair treatment. I would rather take my chances with Ivan Boesky than with Ted Kennedy. BILL CLINTON "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 20 July 28, 1993 Bill Clinton is without a doubt the most engaging, persuasive president this country has had in my lifetime — whi ch goes back to FDR. Neither Ronald Reagan nor John F. Kennedy, eac h widely praised as a presidential charmer, could hold a can dle to Mr. S. Willie. In an interview, a news conference, or a prepared s peech, Mr. Clinton comes across as sincere, down-to-earth, humble, ext remely knowledgeable, and passionate about his beliefs. But it’s also true that, in a profession in which d ishonesty is the first and foremost qualification, Bill Clinton stands hea d and shoulders above the pack when it comes to telling whoppers. I have never in my life seen a man for whom lies roll off the tongue w ith such ease. And it’s simply too much to believe that a man who seems to have stored so many facts and figures in his brain — rea dy to be trotted out whenever the appropriate question is asked — doesn’ t realize that what he’s saying is completely opposite to the trut h of the matter at hand. Not only that, too often what he says is comp letely opposite to what he said just a few months or days earlier — or even a few minutes ago. On July 20, I watched him in action on the Larry Ki ng Show . In that wonderful, engaging style of his, the fibs came pou ring out one after another. Of course, all his stock clichés were there — this is the “first serious effort,” “I’ve spelled out specific cuts,”, “had to make the tough choices,” “gays have served with distinction,” “ask the rich to pay their fair share,” and so on. Not to mention his #1 cliché — “the past 12 years” — which pops up at least every five minut es. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 21 But beyond these vacuous phrases and the endless sl ogans were the misstatements, inconsistencies, twisted logic, inve nted facts, and — to put it mildly — barefaced lies. One minute he said that all the savings from his pl an were going into a trust fund to reduce the deficit — and that was an absolute promise on his part. The next minute he was saying there was p lenty of money available for the Mississippi flood victims because , thanks to lower interest rates, the current year’s deficit was lowe r than expected. At five minutes past the hour he was saying we must encourage American businessmen to create more jobs. At quarte r past, he was saying you don’t have to worry about the tax bill b ecause the rich (American businessmen, I presume) were going to pay almost all of it. By the half hour, he was railing as usual that the rich had gotten a free ride for — you guessed it — “the last 12 years.” Bu t by quarter of, he was back on their side again — saying that deficit reduction would lower interest rates enough that even the rich woul d come out ahead. A particularly outrageous whopper was his statement that, because of his courageous efforts to finally “come to grips wi th the deficit,” the recent Tokyo summit was the first time in (let’s al l say it together now) “12 years” that foreign leaders had treated an American president with respect. It seems they had been plea ding for (ready now, 1-2-3) “12 years” for American presidents to d o something to stop “sucking money from all over the world to pay for our deficits.” I guess at those state dinners Ronald Reagan was ma de to sit at the children’s table. Of course, Larry King’s audience isn’t likely to be aware that those foreign leaders have budget deficits of their own t hat are as bad as — or worse than — ours. And if Larry King were aware of that, he still wouldn’t be likely to call attention to it and bite the presidential hand that’s feeding him. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 22 And, of course, Mr. Clinton bragged about having br ought interest rates down. To hear him tell the story, you’d think that interest rates had been rising steadily for the past, well, 144 mo nths — until they suddenly started plunging last November when the wo rld saw that “change” was in the air. But . . . the downward trend in long-term rates was in motion long before last November — and the long-standing downwa rd trend in short-term rates came to a halt in October when it became apparent that Mr. Clinton had the election sewn up. With his patented abandon, a few minutes later Mr. Clinton flip- flopped and took credit for the fact that short-ter m rates aren’t falling. Thanks to his “serious efforts” to do you-know-what after you-know- how-long, short-term rates have stopped falling — a llowing long-term rates to come down to join them. Apparently, econom ic Nirvana means having no spread between short and long inter est rates. And, lastly, in his latest installment in the conti nuing evolution of “how little the tax increase will cost you,” he sai d that you’ll pay only $1 a week in higher gasoline taxes. The rest will c ome from soaking the rich. The preceding week on the same show, a De mocratic flack had said it was $25 a year. In the State of the Uni on address, it had been $17 a month. Tomorrow’s figure is likely to be 38½¢ a day. The current campaign to sell the budget deal is foc used on the idea that those who oppose it have the crazy idea that a tax increase will cost them something. Administration spokesmen, star ting with Mr. Bill and supported by journalistic sycophants like Larry King, run around asking people how much they earn and then re assuring them that they won’t be affected by the tax increase. After all, the deficit is going to be reduced entir ely through spending cuts that are guaranteed to take effect the day aft er the Messiah returns, and by taxing the filthy rich retroactivel y from the time of the Messiah’s first visit."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 23 FAMILY BORROWING vs. GOVERNMENT BORROWING February 36, 1995 We’re told . . . that families borrow and companies borrow, so why shouldn’t governments borrow? The difference is (an d why, pray tell, must it even be necessary to explain this?) that fa milies and companies must pay back what they borrow — and pay it back out of their own earnings — so most people borrow with car e. Politicians make no plans to repay what they borrow , they don’t even notice which spending program will be financed out of revenues and which will require borrowing. And when they leave o ffice, they accept no personal responsibility for paying back t he debt — they just collect their pensions. In other words, they are un affected by the eventual consequences of borrowing — and so they fe el no restraint. That is the difference between family borrowing and gov ernment borrowing. FIGHTING CHILD LABOR July 28, 1996 Today there are places in the world that are no mor e advanced than America was a hundred years ago. In those places, c hildren have to work to help support their families. And working co nditions aren’t exactly on a par with the comfortable offices in th e U.S. Department of Labor in Washington. But pressuring companies to stop employing workers in those conditions won’t transport those workers to air-con ditioned factories with Blue Cross plans and 3-week annual vacations.

But here’s all you need to know about any budget deal: 1. The politicians will take credit for numerous “b udget cuts,” but the government will be bigger next year than this year. 2. The budget won’t be balanced, but the politician s promise that some future Congress will balance the budget. 3. No Congressman will know the specific terms of t he deal until long after he has voted for it — if ever. 4? Whatever tax cuts are included are insignificant co mpared to what you’ll continue to pay. The more things change . . . An Uncertain World Through the 1980s and 1990s I kept stressing the po int that we live in an uncertain world. The trick, as I said over and o ver, is not to eliminate uncertainty but to find a safe way of dea ling with it. This respect for uncertainty led to the current inc arnation of the Permanent Portfolio, which enabled investors to pro fit from the stock market boom and yet not be hurt when the market cra shed in 1987. It also led to a certain measure of frustration for some readers. HOW LITTLE WE KNOW August 22, 1984 There are two amazing things about the investment w orld: "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 25 1. Things almost never turn out the way anyone expe cted; and 2. No one acknowledges the fact that things almost never turn out the way anyone expected. Despite all the logic, the “proven” systems, the re liance on free- market economics, the superior wisdom — the simple truth is that very little turns out as investment advisors say th ings will turn out. . . . Uncertain World The beginning of investment wisdom is to realize th at we live in an uncertain world, that we don’t know enough about ho w the markets work, that we don’t even understand the present ful ly, much less the future. This uncertainty is a problem only when you try to deny its existence. . . . No matter what advice you receive, expect to be sur prised — because you will be. Over and over again, A is supposed to lead to B, but instead it leads to C or gets swallowed up by D. To me, the actual results are humbling. It reminds me, over and over again, how little I understand about how the world works — how little I know of natural law. I believe many things. I have opinions on almost an ything you want to discuss. But events keep telling me I know very little. We live in a vast world that none of us can fully u nderstand. We learn throughout our lives, but we are only chipping away at the ignorance — not eliminating it. Growing Up "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 26 Throughout your entire life, you are only trying to grow up — to understand how to act, how to think, what to do to get what you want. Every year, you look back and say, “I didn’t unders tand everything last year, but now I won’t make those mistakes agai n.” And you won’t make those mistakes again. You’ll make new ones. Every once in a while, I’m perceptive enough to rem ind myself that, if last year’s ideas seem so immature today, today’s i deas may not look so hot next year. How You Live The fact that we live in an uncertain world doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do about your investments. You’ve m anaged to deal with the rest of your life successfully — in areas offering no more certainty than the investment markets offer. In the real world, no one guarantees that you’ll ha ve a job forever. But that doesn’t stop you from working and earning a go od living. Nor does anyone guarantee that your loved one will be with you always, but that doesn’t stop you from enjoying eac h other today, tomorrow, next month, next year. Despite the uncertainty, you know there are ways to succeed in every other area of your life. Why not with investments a s well? . . . This Is it There are no mystical secrets hidden behind the cur tain that would enable you to read the future — in the markets or a nywhere else in life. The world you see is the world you get. There are no secret weapons, no guaranteed trading systems, no special indicators, no hot hands, no ways to beat r eality.

Safety, profit, and peace of mind begin the day you quit wishing you could find an in fallible system and start devising a strategy based on uncertainty. . . . TALK, TALK, TALK February 23, 1988 I have written so much about the futility of foreca sts that you may be sick of it by now. But I still don’t feel that I’ve said it all. I’m missing something that remains to be said. It isn’t just forecasts. It’s 90% of what’s written about economics and investments. It’s all just talk. The investment world is drowning in words — words a bout the significance of what just happened, somebody’s expl anation of what is significant in his favorite investment category, a projection of what the present is leading to, the “fact” that sooner o r later some event is inevitable. And yet almost all these interpretations appear hop elessly naïve if read 6 months or a year later. But still we read an d listen and sometimes act on such statements — as though experi ence had shown that they might have some value. . . . We listen endlessly and avidly to people pontificat ing on the past, present, and future — as though they really had som ething to say. Are we simply investment junkies, addicted to talk that does us no good but is habit-forming? HISTORY DOESN’T REPEAT ITSELF LITERALLY May 4, 1993 "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 28 Low dividend yields are traditionally considered to be forerunners of a market peak. And those who feel bound by the preced ents of history scoff at any suggestion that times may have changed . The “history repeats itself” argument might be summed up as: Whenever the tail-end of a bull market sends the di vidend yield to a low point, the bulls search for reasons to bel ieve that this time things will be different — that new conditions justify such a low dividend yield. But each time the limits of t he market assert themselves and bring great losses to those w ho refuse to learn from history. I agree that it’s foolish to ignore history. But it ’s just as foolish to believe that history has fixed a limit on how far s omething can go. The truth is that there is no limit to how low the dividend yield can go — short of zero. The record that seems today to be an absolute limit was itself once considered unlikely because it had never before bee n reached. I suspect that when the dividend yield dropped to 3.5 % in the late 1950s, a lot of investment analysts warned that a m arket top was nigh — since 3.5% had never been breached before. But th e market continued higher, and yields continued to fall unti l they bottomed at 2.84% in 1961. In fact, conditions do change as the decades pass — establishing new standards and new apparent limits. History doesn’t repeat itself — not literally, nor even figuratively. People learn from experience, they change, and they change institutions. Otherwise we’ d still be trying to figure out how to cross the river Jordan. . . . The only lesson that history seems to repeat is tha t no one can use history to predict the future. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 29 December 16, 1993 Early this year, I thought inflation might indeed b e on the way back. . . . So far, that possibility hasn’t been realize d. I don’t believe — as many seem to — that gold price s forecast inflation rates. That would require gold investors to possess some special ability to foresee inflation — a special gi ft denied to the rest of humanity. . . . Gold has made its spectacular gains only by moving with inflation or just behind it. When gold tries to bl aze the trail itself, it doesn’t get very far. Of course, for all I know, inflation may well come back with a vengeance a year or two from now. Certainly Preside nt Clinton — a caring, compassionate man — is doing everything he can to aid those of us who might like to see gold stage a comeback. Budget deficits sure to rise over the rainbow, taxe s as high as an elephant’s eye — these are not the ingredients of a healthy economy. And we have to wonder whether, somewhere down the l ine, Alan Greenspan will get religion and decide that fightin g inflation isn’t as important as getting the economy moving again. But if you’re trying to decide where the economy an d the investment markets will be going the next few years, my advice to you is: don’t . Don’t try to figure it out. Don’t think that there’ s anything the Clinton program has made inevitable. The government battered the economy during the 1960 s — with new federal programs, new paper money, and new controls . But the economy withstood it quite well — and both GNP and the stock market soared to higher and higher levels. Of course, the reckoning arrived — but not until th e 1970s. And that’s the point. If this were, say, 1965, you couldn’t he lp but believe the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 30 economy and the markets were about to take a terrib le dive. They did, but not before many years passed. The same may happen again. The Clinton program may, in fact, help parts of the economy that are quite visible — while other sectors suffer in the shadows. There may even be enough app arent prosperity to get Mr. Clinton reelected in 1996. That prosperity might keep the stock market chuggin g along for another few years. It might dampen inflationary exp ectations. And it might even keep interest rates relatively low. “Ban kruptcy 1995” may go the way of “The Depression of 1990” — which is t o say nowhere . I’m not saying any of this will happen. I’m saying only that anything can happen — and that the investment markets seem t o take sadistic delight in punishing those who believe they’re smar ter and more perceptive than the rest of us. Predicting the Future Even in the early days of the newsletter, I was war y of predictions (although not wary enough to avoid them entirely). But the realization that it is impossible to predict human action — and especially impossible to predict events that will depend upon the actions of millions of humans — grew steadily during the first 10 years of the newsletter, until I became a complete agnostic abou t the future. SEEING ALL THE POSSIBILITIES September 15, 1975 No one can predict the future precisely. Even where fundamental factors indicate specific trends, the timing of tho se trends can’t be specified; it can only be guessed at. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 31 It is important for an investment advisor to state all the possibilities he can see. There are always risks — most importantly, the risk that the advisor is wrong. So the advisor should always info rm his customer of the risks involved — because the risks may be more than the client should bear . And it is always the client who does bear them. . . . My work is designed to aid the investor who does no t want to spend all his time watching his investments — or watching his investor advisor. I offer long-term alternatives — mainly fo r the investor who wants to make his investments and then spend his ti me doing other things. FORECASTING vs. STRATEGY March 9, 1980 We act on our expectations of the future. But to co nfuse expectations with certainty is the road to disaster. Humility is the realization that you don’t know everything, or even everything about any particular thing, and it is an investor’s most vital asset. Ar rogance eventually ruins any investor — no matter how well he’d been d oing. Once you get beyond the feeling that you must be ab le to predict the future, you can get down to the serious business of investing in a realistic manner. Since you can’t predict the futur e, you’ll develop a strategy that allows you to deal successfully with an uncertain world — a strategy that recognizes your own weaknesses an d emotions, as well as your ignorance. PREDICTING THE GOLD PRICE March 2, 1982 No matter how plausible a prediction may sound, att empts to guess the future are both unrealistic and unnecessary. Th ere are more factors"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 32 affecting an outcome than anyone could hope to cons ider. Predictions are only parlor games — a form of entertainment. Th ey aren’t tools for making investment profits. . . . Whether based on fundamental or technical analysis, predictions and forecasts can have a plausible ring to them. They c an seem to be based on considerations of the real world. Unfortunately, the human mind doesn’t have the ability to recall the plausibility of earlier predictions that didn’t work out. For example, way back in 1980, it was explained to us that central banks would buy enough gold at $600 to prevent the price from going lower, because they wanted to protect the value of their large gold holdings. By citing this now, I’m admittedly beatin g a very dead horse; but it doesn’t hurt to remember this wheneve r we’re given a plausible reason that gold can’t go below $400 or $ 350 or $200 . . . or $35. 1 We were told that the South African and Soviet gove rnments would reduce their sales to the market, if necessary, to keep the gold price from dropping too far. Before that, we were told th e U.S. government would sell enough gold to keep the price from going too high. Neither forecast was redeemed by the future. . . . A “better than average track record” in predictions is of no help, because one bad forecast can more than offset a lot of gains. For example, many people were so impressed with the ability of one forecaster or another to predict higher prices for silver during the 1970s that they refrained from selling at $30, $40, or $50 — when those same forecasters raised their predictions for the top to $100 or higher. Many of those investors bought at prices co nsiderably higher   1 Amazingly, a London gold dealer just resurrected th at argument to explain why gold wouldn’t go below $350."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 33 than today’s. For them, one successful and one unsu ccessful prediction have combined to create large net losses . . . . As in Life Forecasting schemes can be very compelling, because they seem to offer a system that will beat the world. The great white hope always is that there’s a way to get ahead of everyone else. This hope isn’t limited to the investment world; it permeates all areas of life. People look to ESP, utilitarian religions, reincarnation, astrology, Elliott Wave, computer investment system s, numerology, Biblical prophecy, and dozens of other doctrines to get an edge. These ideas can be interesting and entertaining to explor e, but they can’t help us to predict the future or guide our actions successfully. Eventually, we have to return to the real world — t o what we can perceive with our five physical senses. And we need to develop a philosophy (or investment strategy) to use what we see — a strategy that’s consistent with what we know about human act ion. Any other ideas and systems belong to another world — they ar en’t likely to help us in this one. Investment markets are ruled by the same human acti ons that affect the rest of our lives. We can’t expect mysterious r ules that make no sense elsewhere to prevail in the investment market s. In other areas, you act on assumptions and expectat ions. But you’re ready to alter your assumptions as new evidence bec omes available. You can do this because you don’t confuse expectati ons with facts, and because you have a philosophy that can guide yo u through an uncertain world. Your philosophy allows you to prof it from your assumptions, as well as abandon them cheaply when t hey prove to be wrong. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 34 But a prediction implies a certainty, a precision, that doesn’t exist in the real world. It encourages you to place a bet th at can pay off only if the prediction turns out to be correct. Such bettin g is no wiser in the investment world than it would be elsewhere. The strange thing is that most people aren’t concer ned with predictions in other areas of life. One sets goals, rather than predictions, for his income, personal relationships , and living conditions — and tries to satisfy his goals. But on ly a foolish individual places bets on the future — such as maki ng a purchase based on a prediction of a higher income that will pay for it. And yet, when one enters the investment markets, th e first thing he does is to look for a fortune-teller, someone who c an predict next year’s gold price. In other areas, the fortune-tell er is an object of amusement. But nine out of ten economists and inves tment advisors attempt to make their reputations as soothsayers — and nine out of ten investors spend their lives trying to find the soot hsayer who’s genuine. They never seem to learn that the fortune-teller wi th the perfect record up to now will go sour the moment you start acting on his predictions. “Insiders” are of no more help than seers. In 1970, the chief gold trader at a large Swiss bank told a friend of mine that the gold price would never go above $40. When asked how he could b e so sure, the trader replied, “Because we control the market.” FORECASTERS SHOULD BE FABULOUSLY WEALTHY January 27, 1994 [Forecasters] intend that we should take their pred ictions very seriously. In doing so, they try to promote an assu mption that’s unrealistic. They would like us to believe that the re are degrees of success in forecasting. They use expressions such a s “Of course, no"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 35 one has a perfect record” or “We all have our good calls and bad calls.” We are meant to believe that forecasting ma y produce more or less benefits. But that isn’t really true. And if you stop and thi nk clearly on the matter, you realize that there’s something not quit e right about the way the case for forecasting is presented. You eith er can make money forecasting or you can’t. As with pregnancy, there are no shades of gray. The question is: “Can you make a profit forec asting the future or can’t you?” If the answer is no, I don’t want anyth ing to do with your predictions. If the answer is yes, we have some bus iness to discuss. If you can forecast the future, then you should be rich — very, very rich. I don’t mean that you’ve accumulated a paltry million dollars or so. I mean you must have a quarter billion, $2 bill ion, $5 billion, or more. Why wouldn’t you? If you can reliably forecast the investment markets, you should be able to make profits of at l east 50% a year — if not 100% or more. If you could produce even 20% a year reliably, you would be the most wanted investment advisor in the world. It wouldn’t matter if you didn’t have a penny to begin with; there are people out there with plenty of money — Bank of Ame rica, George Soros, Goldman Sachs, and hundreds more — who would gladly stake $100 million or more on your genius. And after you’ d accumulated a few million for yourself, you could kiss them goodb ye and keep 100% of your future forecasting profits. Almost every investment advisor claims to have a pr ofitable fore- casting record. But why, then, isn’t Rupert Murdoch or Fidelity Funds beating down his door with offers? He may say that they don’t know about his talents. But why not? They have good reas on to seek out someone so talented, wherever he is. Or he may say that they refuse to believe he can do what he says. But if he can’t prove to them that he can forecast the future profitably,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 36 why should we believe him? There’s nothing vague about investment trades: every buy or sell order has an established price and identifiable transaction costs. So there’s nothing gray about th e outcome: either the forecaster makes money on his forecasts or he d oesn’t. If he’s successful doing it, he can prove it to anyone. Of course, if all he does is toss off a number of p redictions and then revisit a handful of them a year or two later, we’r e not talking about the real world or real money. We’re simply playing a parlor game — Master of the Universe for would-be investors. In that case, he should play the game and have fun, but he shouldn’t ask us to pay attention to him or allow him to make our investment decisions. IS THE END NIGH? November 20, 1996 We could review all the warning signs that this bul l market is running on borrowed time. But what good would it do? We cou ld have done the same thing a few years back when the Dow was ar ound 3,000, but time has proven that the warning signs were only cu riosities. The Benefits of a Permanent Portfolio Over the past 15 years readers have been inundated with reasons, examples, reassurances, and badgering that only a w ell-balanced Permanent Portfolio would allow them to relax about their investments. Here are some of my comments. BEING PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING June 13, 1984 "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 37 [In answer to a questioner who feared that the gove rnment was going to replace the currency and that it might repudiate all its debt — making Treasury securities worthless. ] It isn’t that these things can never happen (the fi rst rule of investing is that anything can happen), but they are no more likely than any of hundreds of other potential disasters — disasters t hat don’t happen to engage your interest. The answer isn’t to outguess the government’s inten tions (you can’t), but to be sure you’re protected against any such ev entuality by having a balanced Permanent Portfolio. Invested 100% in Treasury securities, any sane pers on would lie awake nights wondering about the most remote risks to Treasury securities. But if only 20% to 30% of your portfoli o is in Treasury securities, and the other investments are pointed i n various other directions, you know that any losses inflicted on y ou by surprise currency exchanges or debt repudiations would be mo re than offset by gains in your gold, Swiss francs, etc. THE 1987 STOCK MARKET CRASH October 21, 1987 The stock market crash was a shock to the system, a nd it caused losses that won’t be completely offset immediately. But it can’t destroy you if you have a balanced portfolio. Most investors have all their capital — precious and speculative — in the stock market. And, no matter how much they have made in the market over the past few years, the crash has been a terrible trauma for them. Not just because of the money lost — but because there’s no way to know how much more will be lost, since they’ re afraid to sell and see the market rebound, and because the crash m akes such a person realize just how vulnerable he is."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 38 The Permanent Portfolio sparkles at times like thes e. Its most important benefit is the knowledge that you can wea ther these crises, and so you don’t have to be afraid of what’s coming next. If you don’t have a balanced, safe Permanent Portfo lio, I hope the crash has prompted you to get your house in order n ow. GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION October 21, 1987 I think geographic diversification is vital. The Permanent Portfolio will be safe enough to walk away from and forget only if it allows for more than just the pro blems and hazards that are obvious today. It will have to allow for a ll the unforeseeable events of the next 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. Keeping some investments outside your home country provides safe and easy protection against surprises that might ha ppen anywhere — confiscation of gold holdings by the government, ex change controls, civil disorder, even war. Having some of your investments outside the United States offers several benefits: 1. It will preserve those assets even if war or civ il disorder should disrupt record-keeping in the U.S. 2. It will give you the time and opportunity to res pond to any extraordinary policies adopted by the U.S. governme nt. No one knows how the President or Congress elected in 1988 or 19 92 might choose to solve the economic problems they’ll face. Exprop riating your property for some urgent public purpose might strik e them as the ideal solution."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 39 3. It will reduce what you might lose to mismanagem ent, a weakening of law enforcement, or a physical catastrophe in th e United States. These hazards may seem remote. And they are — in th e sense that I don’t expect any of them to happen tomorrow morning . But they are real hazards, and now and then you feel the reality — when a politician urges something especially dangerous or foolish, or it’s revealed that the Internal Revenue Service has acte d in a particularly heavy-handed way, or an international conflict thre atens to erupt into something big. Someday a remote hazard will grow into an immediate threat. Geographic diversification is a necessary part of m aking sure the Permanent Portfolio can handle whatever hazard mate rializes. THE 1987 MARKET CRASH WITH A PERMANENT PORTFOLIO December 16, 1987 On October 19, when the Dow Jones Industrial Averag e fell 22.6%, the 4-investment Permanent Portfolio lost only 4.3% of its value. As of December 11, the portfolio is down 6.3% from its high reached on August 14, but still up 3.9% for 1987. The Permanent Portfolio Fund had a similar experien ce. It dropped 3.0% on October 19 (to $14.71 from $15.17). At $14. 56 on December 11, it is down 7.8% from its high of $15.80 on Augu st 3 — but is still up 10.5% from $13.18, at which it closed 1986. THE 1987 MARKET CRASH WITHOUT A PERMANENT PORTFOLIO January 17, 1988 "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 40 [There is an] amazing number of newsletter writers who somehow got out before the crash. My mail box has been flooded with solicitations fro m newsletters that were astute enough to have their subscribers on the right side of the market. But The Hulbert Financial Digest , which monitors 203 model portfolios recommended by newsletters, found that 7 7% of them lost at least 10% for the month of October alone. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. One newslet ter that was rated #1 by Hulbert two years in a row lost 58% in just one month. You can imagine how reassured I felt when I received a soli citation from that newsletter, telling me, “Many of our subscribers we re 100% in cash well before the 508 point crash of the DJIA.” Another newsletter, which through June 30 had compi led the best 7- year record of all the newsletters Hulbert has monitored, lost 57% in October. But, by contrast, the editor of that newsl etter is one of a small handful of writers who have acknowledged publ icly that they were on the wrong side of the market in October. The one-month losses listed in Hulbert are something to behold — with numbers like 21%, 30%, 41%, 50%, 75%. But many of these writers scurried around and found references in pre-crash issues to “caution” or “selectivity” or “ storm clouds.” Somehow these became, ex post facto , warnings to get out of the market; it’s too bad if you didn’t get the point. After all, 21%, 30%, and so on are just numbers. Th e important thing is to preserve one’s reputation as a market genius.

February 28, 1997 There’s nothing I can say to shed any light on the potential duration of the bull market — nothing I haven’t said many times before. It will end when it ends, and there’s no way we can foresee it — not by examining the economy, not by pouring over charts, not by looking at"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 43 ratios of one thing to another, and not by investig ating historical patterns. Not only that, but we don’t know how it will end. Will it come with a bang or a whimper? Will there be an enormous crash, in the style of 1929 or 1987 — or will there be a long, slow, stead y descent — as happened in 1973-1974? We don’t know. And anyone wh o claims to know is just having a good time at your expense — a nd maybe his own as well. What should you do? Just make sure precious capital isn’t vulnerable to a stock-market collapse. If you have less than 3 5% of your Permanent Portfolio in the stock market, nothing th at happens there can destroy you. If you have 50% in the market, a s udden crash might force you to make drastic changes in your retiremen t plans. Learning from the Hard-Money Era In early 1980 it became apparent that the risk-rewa rd ratio had been altered considerably. Gold at $600-800 was no longe r the safe investment it had been at $35 — or even $100. Silve r at $30-50 was not the same investment it had been at $3, $5, or e ven $10. By this time I was fully aware that neither I nor a nyone else could predict how high these prices would go. But it was unlikely that either gold or silver would go so high that it was worth r isking the destruction of the tremendous profits we’d accumula ted. In January 1980 Terry Coxon asked me whether I was going to suggest that people sell their silver holdings. As I recall, I asked him, “Why would I do that?” — but by the time the words were out of my mouth, the answer was obvious to me. So, with silve r fluctuating between $35 and $40, I wrote a 5-page article revie wing the history of silver, and pointing out that it was no longer wort h holding. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 44 I’ll always be grateful to him for calling my atten tion to the obvious. Meanwhile, I worried that our readers would be over extended and unable to cope with the inevitable fall that would accompany the end of the hard-money bull market — since this was befo re the days of a well-balanced Permanent Portfolio. And my feelings of that time should be just as appropriate today for investors w ho have bet their all either that today’s bull market in stocks will last forever or that they’ll know how to get out before the inevitable fall. As you read some of the early excerpts, translate t he references to precious metals in 1981 into stocks in 1997. One of my proudest accomplishments as an investment writer was in help ing people recognize when the hard-money era ended. I hope tha t today I have kept some people from throwing everything into the stock market. FAREWELL TO SILVER January 23, 1980 The extraordinary promise of silver ten years ago w as based upon three factors: (1) nearly 100 years of U.S. governm ent price controls; (2) the inelasticity of industrial demand; and (3) the inelasticity of production. The combination of these factors create d a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity. . . . In my books, I’ve maintained that the [supply-deman d] deficit will be eliminated when the silver price is high enough to cause enough industrial consumers of silver to abandon the use o f it. And I’ve said that we probably couldn’t know what price that woul d be until after the fact, but that it would be enough above $5 to m ake silver a worthwhile investment. The reason for the uncommonly large price increase would be the inelasticity of demand. In most industrial applicat ions of silver (silverware is the main exception), the amount of s ilver used in the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 45 end-product is very small, although critical to the success of the product. Thus, an increase in the silver price woul d not significantly affect the manufacturer’s cost — while abandoning s ilver would significantly affect the value of the product. These fundamentals, as stated several years ago, we re discoverable, logical, and very promising. The problem today is t hat many people will attempt to apply them to $40 silver in the way they applied to $1.29 or $5 silver. . . . No one can know for sure what the equilibrium price for silver will have to be. But at least we can know that a demand that was inelastic at a price of $1.29 doesn’t have to remain inelasti c at a price 31 times higher. . . . The premise for including silver in the Permanent P ortfolio was an expectation that, over a period of a few years, the price would probably rise by 200% or more. While there might be other investments with large p otentials, silver had the advantage of being a physical commodity tha t could be stored in a Swiss bank (or elsewhere) — immune to governme nt intervention, market closings, chaos, defaults, etc . It was an ideal component in a Permanent Portfolio. While silver still has the latter advantages, it no longer has the overwhelming potential for price appreciation that it had at $5 or less. I can’t tell you that it won’t go to $100 (or more) eventually. But there was far, far more reason to expect $15 when it was at $5 than there is today to expect it to go to $100. It is no longer a n investment that is clearly underpriced. . . . At $40 per ounce, silver has more than satisfied it s reason for being in the portfolio. What is surprising about the situati on is that the price achieved was so high and that it happened so quickl y. I had expected"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 46 to hold silver for several more years — and I hadn’ t dreamed the price would be so high even then. . . . I suppose that, no matter how I put the case, someo ne may say I’ve lost faith in silver. But how could I lose faith in something that’s been so good to me? I will always be grateful to Jerome Smith for bringing silver to my attention in 1967 (and, incidentally, luring me into the investment business.) Silver has done everything that was expected of it — and more — and now its run is ending. We can’t always live in the future. Sometimes the f uture arrives. Many of us have lived a long time with silver’s fut ure, and it’s hard to realize that the “future” is now the past. . . . Ah silver, you’ve been so good to us. Now that you’ re retiring, I wish you had a son who could take your place in the busi ness. HARD-MONEY INVESTMENTS — THE WAVE OF THE PAST March 18, 1981 The heyday of hard-money investments is over. What’ s left is only the inevitable aftermath, the time when what was once a vant-garde becomes commonplace — and therefore worthless. . . . Consider these lines from a book published in 1980: There are two secrets to financial success in infla tionary periods. They are: (1) Buy equity — things that will go up in value as the dollar loses its purchasing power. (2) Use borrowed money."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 47 The author goes on to point out that by equities he means such things as “real estate, commodities, gold and other precio us metals, some stocks, art and antiques, wine, old stamps, books a nd rugs, memorabilia.” 6 Is this an isolated piece of advice from someone wh o is privy to the wisdom of the insiders? Hardly. I heard much the sa me thing stated over and over again to 4,000 people at the New Orle ans Gold Conference last November. On the New York Times best-seller list of March 1, the #3 book was Douglas Casey’s Crisis Investing , in its 26th week on the list — including a few weeks in first place. Jerome Smith’ s The Coming Currency Collapse was #8, in its 12th week on the list. Both books a re dominated by hard-money advice. In 13th place, afte r 39 weeks on the list, was Robert G. Allen’s Nothing Down — a book that tells you how to speculate in real estate with borrowed money . And in 15th place was Venita VanCaspel’s Money Dynamics for the 1980s — a book I assume is sympathetic to hard-money investme nts. (I haven’t read it but I’m acquainted with the author.) These four best-sellers are only the icing on the c ake. Many book stores prominently display a table of “inflation be aters” — books with “alternative” approaches to investment. There are l iterally dozens of such books — including one called America’s Coming Nightmare Inflation, Economic Collapse & Crime Revolution . . . . 4 The daring, adventurous, stand-alone investment pol icies of the 1970s have become the trite, cocktail-party clichés of th e 1980s. When I first started accumulating silver coins and gold coins, I had to go into the back of a liquor store to find Louis Ca rabini’s Pacific   6 How to Invest Your Money & Profit from Inflation by Morton Shulman, Random House, N.Y.; pages 29-30. 4 This is not a joke.

Today you can buy gold bullion at Ci tibank, Republic National Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust, and other big banks. You can buy gold or silver certificates at First National B ank of Chicago and many other places. You can even get gold passbook a ccounts(!) at First National Bank of Chicago and Deak National Ba nk. The “establishment” newspapers are overrun with art icles on gold, silver, currencies, collectibles, you name it. In t he next few weeks, People magazine will publish an interview with myself and two other hard-money advisors. People magazine, for God’s sake! And for one last example, in the new movie Why Woul d I Lie? a young man about to inherit $300,000 says he’s going to invest it in silver, and cites the world’s silver shortage as th e reason for his plan. . . . Some of us started buying hard-money investments as long ago as 1967 (or before). We didn’t expect their prices to shoot upward the next day; we knew it could be several years before they took off. As it turned out, the upward moves didn’t start until 197 0 for gold, 1971 for silver, and 1973 for the Swiss franc. And after ris ing to $5 from $1.29, silver sat still from 1974 to 1978. Waiting was an unavoidable part of the investments. Even after the prices took off, we knew we might have to wait seve ral more years before our objectives were reached. When the day arrived, the profits more than compens ated for the wait. But waiting had become a habit, a way of life; we w ere geared to living in the future. It wasn’t easy to realize tha t the future had become the present. Worse yet, the future became the past — and hard-mo ney investors continued to live in what they believed was the fut ure, although it was"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 49 now the past. Dreams of price explosions are not an ticipations anymore; they are nostalgia. . . . It isn’t easy to know when to sell. You can buy an investment at $5, sell it at $20 for a 300% profit, and then see it g o to $50. You may spend the rest of your life kicking yourself becaus e you didn’t wait until $50 — as if you would have had greater percep tion at $50 than you had at $20. . . . 7 Investing, Investments, & Advisors I have not been easy on investment advisors. I have criticized them for claiming successes they didn’t achieve — thereby lu ring investors into believing they could be safe just by following the advisor with the perfect record. Over and over I have tried to wean investors away f rom reliance on the expectations of an investor advisor — whether t hat advisor was I or someone else. LOOKING DOWN OUR NOSES May 16, 1983 Part of the fun of investing, both for the investor s themselves and for their advisors, is being able to pretend that one i s so much smarter than the other players in the market. Investment writing is saturated with remarks about the dumb sheep who can’t seem to recognize facts that are obvious to the writer and   7 My 6-year association with Terry Coxon has helped m e to keep hard- money investments in perspective, and had a lot to do with my suggestions to sell the Swiss franc in 1978 and the Permanent Portfolio silver in 1980. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 50 the reader. The implication is that the writer and the reader are part of an elite — the chosen few — who understand the secr ets of economics and investing, secrets that are unavailab le to the ordinary investor. . . . Unfortunately, reality isn’t quite so accommodating . In the real world, investing is never easy. There are no dumb sheep ju st waiting for you to fleece them. Other people know there’s such a th ing as inflation; other people are astute enough to distrust politici ans; other people are capable of being right or being wrong. . . . In March 1980, when silver had fallen to $30 from $ 50, I listened as a well-known hard-money advisor explained to an audie nce that the silver bull market couldn’t be over because the pub lic was selling its silver heirlooms — and the public is always on the wrong side. It may have been fun to look down our noses at the public who had just then discovered silver. But today there are a lot of long-term silver owners who wish they’d followed the dumb her d and sold at $30 — rather than following the expert and riding t he price down to $5. It may be fun to make up aphorisms about the ignora nce and emotions of the investing public. But the successful investo r can’t afford to get carried away thinking about other people’s “fear an d greed.” He’s too busy watching his own emotions — trying as best he can to overcome his own pride, wishful thinking, and fear of missing bandw agons.

Tomorrow someone might offer you an am azing"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 51 discovery that represents a breakthrough to profit and safety. Or maybe someone will offer you a perpetual-motion mac hine. Systems and indicators assume an essentially static world — in which all movement is merely a deviation from, or a retur n to, norms that remain the same year after year, even century after century. But in fact we live in a world in which the underlying causes o f prices — technology, human wants, and existing resources — c hange constantly. Thus no track record, covering the past, can tell y ou what works today; no indicator can foretell market movements; no system can take the uncertainty out of investing; and no inves tment can truly promise a profit without threatening a loss. . . .

On the Front Page for issue 143 [Page 143-8] you d iscussed the scandal in which Japanese stock brokers reimbursed large clients for their trading losses. As you pointed out, the practice of reimbursing cli ents for losses isn’t inherently evil or imprudent. Clients with large ac counts may be prized and the income generated substantial. However, such practices affect other clients. I sus pect that fees are raised and numerous accounting tricks are employed to make it all possible with the least disruption. I wonder if it is ever stated on an"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 52 annual report or in some other public document that clients were paid for losses. Not likely. If such information were made freely available, the n investors could decide for themselves whether they were being treat ed right by the firm. A? Everything you need to know in this regard is given to you in one message — the price the firm charges you for its se rvices. If the price is right, what difference does it make what t he firm does with the money you pay it? And if the price is too high, it doesn’t matter how ”fair” and equitable the firm is trying to be w ith you. Worrying about a firm’s relationships with other pe ople is a waste of time. If it leads to anything, it is to resentme nt or envy — which are even greater wastes of time. WHAT MAKES A COLLECTIBLE VALUABLE March 29, 1992 Q. I am seeing a lot of ads these days for “collectib les.” These include everything from new editions of coins to baseball c ards. I know you’ve written that you don’t care much for collect ibles, and I also am skeptical of anything so popular. Still, it appears that many items produced a few de cades ago now command amazing prices — such things as dolls, matc hbooks, and campaign buttons. And it’s hard not to get caught u p in the desire to find something today that will be worth a lot 10 or 20 years from now. I notice that some of the items being produced toda y are limited to very small editions. Does the limited supply increa se the chance that they will become valuable someday? A? It increases the chance from non-existent to very t iny. There is one characteristic common to all the collectibles c ommanding high"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 53 prices today: none of them was produced originally as a “collectible.” The dolls, campaign buttons, books, coins, and silver plate all were produced for use and enjoyment — not as investments. I know of nothing born as a “collectible” that ever grew in market value. Any exceptions must be rare indeed. The sought-after treasure of the year 2010 isn’t be ing advertised today as a collectible. It is hidden among the crowd of p lain merchandise that surrounds you. It might be a ball-point pen or a pizza delivery box. If you get the impression from this that planning f or success in tomorrow’s collectibles market is a little like pla ying the lottery, you’re beginning to get the point. The winners will be the dealers and a handful of lucky consumers. Foresight has little to do with it. But if you’re determined to try to spot the valuabl e collectible of 2010, I suggest that you focus on long-standing or popular products that are being discontinued. Among them, pay specia l attention to those you’ve found particularly charming — products you’ll miss a little. COMPETING WITH EXPERTS October 9, 1995 I’ve reminded you before, but you can’t be reminded often enough: the experts have nothing on you. There’s no one in this world you can count on to get you into and out of investment mark ets with profitable timing. More confirmation of that has arrived in the form o f a finding by Managed Account Reports that only 27 of the 432 hed ge funds"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 54 tracked by the firm were able to match the return p rovided by the S&P Index. “Hedge funds” are more versatile than most mutual f unds. They go long or short, and they invest in any kind of marke t that currently looks promising. We’re always hearing about folks i n these funds making enormous profits from being in the right pla ce at the right time — whether by buying bonds just before the Fed loosens up or by selling currencies short and supposedly driving exc hange rates down. They usually charge fairly large fees as well — 1% or 2% per year of the assets plus maybe 20% of the profits, even if t he profits aren’t as large as you would get in a Permanent Portfolio or from investing in a stock index. 4 So don’t be impressed by big fees or breathtaking p ress reports. These people don’t know much more than you do. INVESTING & SPECULATING December 17, 1995 As I’ve pointed out frequently, there’s a differenc e between investing and speculating. Investing allows you to increase your wealth by ear ning the return the investment markets offer to everyone. Over the very long term, that’s likely to be around 4% to 5% per year after adjusti ng for inflation. Through careful, conservative investing, you can pr otect and enhance the wealth you create in your business or professio n.   4 I’m indebted to “Gekko” of National Review (August 14, 1995, page 26) for this information."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 55 Speculating is an attempt to beat that return — by putting your money in the right investment markets at the right time, or by picking individual stocks that outpace the market as a whol e. Speculation is for the impatient — those who hope to amass wealth quickly. Forecasts and trading systems are its tools. But sp eculation seldom changes anyone’s life materially — except by bringi ng catastrophic losses. That isn’t to say no one has ever made a fortune sp eculating. Some of us made small or large fortunes during the 1970s. A nd there are people who have managed to stay on the right side o f the markets through most of a long speculating career. But the latter are a rare breed. They are people wh o have a unique intuitive feel for the markets. And some of them ar e just lucky: it’s not unreasonable to expect one out of every 10,000 spec ulators to compile an amazing record. Depending on the Financial Press So much of what we take for granted about investmen ts comes from something we’ve read in the financial press. But bu siness writers are just as biased, and no more accurate, than politica l reporters. I have written a great deal about the misinformation that passes for investment information. Here are a few examples."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 56 EXPLAINING PRICE MOVEMENTS November 1, 1991 The turnaround [in the currency markets] on Tuesday , October 29, points up how little anyone knows of the reasons fo r day-today price movements — even large movements. On Monday, the [Swiss] franc fell 0.85¢ — an unusua lly large one- day drop — to $.6633. According to press reports, t raders expected a forthcoming GNP report (due to be released the next day) to indicate that the U.S. recession had ended. And, in fact, th e report turned out as expected, showing that GNP had grown at an annua l rate of 2.4%. 4 What could be better for the dollar? What could be more bearish for the foreign currencies? And yet the dollar plunged on Tuesday with the franc rising an enormous 1.35¢. Why? Who knows? The explanation reported by the press wa s: yes, the recession appears to be over, but now traders fear that the rebound may be brief and that a second dip might follow. Of course, that possibility had been just as real o n Monday as on Tuesday. So why wasn’t the franc strong on Monday? Again, who knows? In fact, 90% of the time no one knows why any investment market goes up or down on a given day. S ometimes the explanation offered seems to make sense. But the pl ausibility evaporates when you remember that, on some other da y, the same supposed cause was accompanied by the opposite resu lt.   4 The rise of 2.4% means the U.S. Gross National Prod uct was estimated to have risen roughly 0.6% during the July-Septembe r quarter — which would imply a gain of 2.4% if growth continued at t he same rate for an entire year. Any GNP figure reported states an annu al rate of increase, and includes an adjustment for inflation, so that the result is an estimate of the real growth in the economy.

ECONOMIC ILLITERACY July 20, 1994 So much of the alleged data on which we might base short-term investment decisions comes from alleged business an d financial reporters who really are just cheerleaders for a po litical program. Not only do the writers slant economic reporting to accommodate their political beliefs, it’s doubtful that many bu siness reporters even know or care what the truth is, how the economy wor ks, how companies succeed, how people earn money in the inv estment markets, or how government programs affect investme nts. Someday take the time to read every news article in one issue of The Wall Street Journal . Compare the description of the business world you see there with your own experience. You may won der in what world the reporters live. A stunning example of their viewpoint appeared on t he front page of the July 18th Journal in the article “Microsoft Will Remain Dominant Despite Pact in Antitrust Dispute” by G. Pascal Zac hary. The article appeared in conjunction with the recent settlement of the U.S. government’s investigation of Microsoft — the world ’s largest computer software maker. The writer discussed Microsoft’s success at great l ength — and offered as reasons for that success the hardball ta ctics of its founder Bill Gates, its privileged position as maker of bot h operating-system software and application software, the pressure it puts on computer-"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 58 makers to include DOS and Windows with their comput ers, deceptive publicity, hiding secret computer code within the o perating system to gain an edge over rival software makers, bundling i ts programs into “suites” so that smaller companies can’t compete, a nd so on. Apparently, the writer learned all he knows about b usiness from Harold Robbins and Oliver Stone. In the entire long article, there wasn’t a single r eference to the quality of Microsoft products, the company’s service polici es, or levels of customer satisfaction. The writer apparently has ne ver heard that consumers pay for products only when they believe t hey’re getting value. Every Microsoft product has strong competiti on — from Lotus, Word Perfect, IBM, Borland, or someone else — and a ll the hardball tactics in the world can’t force computer users to choose Microsoft over those alternatives. Every business writer should have a plaque on his d esk that reads: Companies succeed by providing what customers need and want at a price they’re willing to pay. Someone writing a story about a successful company should begin by asking: What is the company providing that consumer s are so willing to pay for? If the Journal writer had approached his article this way, he might have identified some of the things that ha ve drawn millions of customers to Microsoft — such as extremely infor mative user manuals, the development of drag-and-drop editing i n word processing and spreadsheets, and programs that comb ine easy access for new users and enormous power for more experienc ed users. The writer missed the most newsworthy aspect of Mic rosoft’s success: its amazing ability to respond to consumer demand even after becoming a giant — avoiding the bureaucratic lethar gy that almost destroyed IBM. Bill Gates’ genius is in recognizing that the consumer is always king, and in providing an exciting “small company” atmosphere to attract the world’s most talented sof tware designers.

Has the 1993 “deficit-red uction” program brought us a new era of lower interest rates? Is th e economy growing stronger? Most of what we know about these matters is taken f rom government press releases that are parroted without criticism by willing business reporters. How much of it is true? It’s hard to know. Even tho se who write the stories don’t know — and, in many cases, may not ca re. In some matters — such as the trend in interest rat es — a simple graph can tell us all we need to know. In others — such as where the deficit is going — we have to ignore what’s being s aid and wait a year or two for the results. And in still others — such as the state of the economy — there is no clear answer, only conflictin g indicators. Not only is the future uncertain, we often don’t know w hat’s happening in the present. This is one more reason you need a Permanent Portfo lio to hold the capital that’s precious to you.

REEXAMINING MY IDEAS "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 60 July 20, 1994 From time to time, we review our editorial format — trying to make it more satisfying for you and more marketable for us. Your suggestions are always welcome, by the way. One piece of advice I’ve received is unassailable: each newsletter issue should be a fast read — with short coverage o f many points, rather than an in-depth look at a few items. This, after all, is what distinguishes newsletters from magazines and books, which cover topics in more detail. Of course, this newsletter is just the opposite of the ideal. I can’t clear my throat without explaining all the details to you . I can’t imagine throwing dozens of facts, tips, and conclusions at you without giving the supporting evidence and analysis. There are two reasons for this: · I like to believe our readers are too intelligent to act on some suggestion just because I made it. · Until I actually write out an explanation for my conclusions, I can’t be sure they’re correct. So wh y shouldn’t you see the reasoning process as well? The first point — that this letter appeals to well- functioning intellects — may be just my conceit. But the second point is u nshakable. There’s no question that writing an explanation mak es my own thinking firmer, cleaner, and more precise. At least once a year, I find myself abandoning an o pinion after trying to write out the reasons to support it. Sometimes I change my mind when I gather the data to buttress an argument and find that the data won’t support my belief. Other times, as I set down the reasoning — that step 1 leads to step 2 to step 3 and so on — I discover that step 2 doesn’t lead to step 3 after all, that there might not even be a step 3.

What’s worse, it can seem that you may l ose your life savings if you don’t choose the right answer right now. At times like that, there’s one suggestion I hope y ou will hold on to, no matter what else you may know: When in doubt about an investment decision, it is a lways better to err on the side of caution. People rarely go broke playing it safe. And people frequently go broke taking great risks or making investments about whic h they know very little. I don’t mean that one should never take risks. Obvi ously, every investment, every action – even inaction – involves some kind of risk. When to take risks, how much to risk, and how to re duce risk are subjects I’ve covered before and will write about a gain. But whenever you’re in a quandary about what to do, the answer is obvious: play it safe . The fact that you’re in a quandary is evidence that you don’t know enough about the investment or its situation to make a clear-cut judgment. WOLVES VS.

But none of those poor sheep has gone broke – at le ast not from leaving his money in stocks or bank deposits. In fa ct, at most, they’ve lost only a little to inflation. Meanwhile, many “sophisticated” investors have lost money – lots of money – buying gold at the wrong time (on “savvy” a dvice, of course), or buying strategic metals (“the gold of t he 1980s”), or losing everything to a coin dealer who went broke while su pposedly storing the investor’s Krugerrands. Results Hard-money investors and advisors are particularly fond of placing themselves above the dummies who are still operatin g by the principles of the 1950s and 1960s. But someone who bought silver at around $2 back in 1968 (when many of the early hard-money books and newsletters first appeared) and who has dutifully held on (as instructed by mos t hard-money advisors) hasn’t very much to show for his sophisti cation. At $7.20 today, a 16-year silver investment has produced a c ompound average gain of only 8.3% per year. Ironically, the Milquetoast who didn’t have the cou rage to reach for the moon, and who simply rolled over his Treasury b ills every year, earned a compound average of 8.5% per year.

And buying gold at $35 in 1968 would give you an annual return of 15.5% as of today. And one may have done very well by selling o r reducing his precious metals at higher prices. But very few of t he bold, sophisticated people did any of those things. Further, had you bought silver at $5 in 1978, just before the big uptrend, your annual return now would be only 6.3%. Gold at $300 in 1979 would give you a annual return of 3.1%. I don’ t even need to mention buying silver at prices above $8 or gold at prices above $350. Over the years, I’ve talked with a number of invest ors who had been convinced by writers and advisors that they had to get all their money into precious metals or some other unfamiliar inves tment before Armageddon – and who now have a large net loss to s how for their foresight. Meanwhile, the sucker with the bank account was get ting his 5% per year. Over the past 16 years, inflation has average d 6.0% per year. So he paid 1% a year for peace of mind. That isn’t suc h a bad bargain. Obviously, I’m not suggesting that you put your mon ey in the local bank. Nor am I saying that it was wrong to invest i n precious metals. I am saying that recent history so far doesn’t confirm the oft-repeated hard-money maxim that only the bold and adventurous will survive financially. I am suggesting that you not join any stampedes into investments you don’t understand – risking money yo u can’t afford to lose.   1 The T-bill result is based on the average yearly au ction prices for 52-week bills from 1968 to 1983, and reported in various Federal Reserve publications.

YOU & BERNARD BARUCH We’ve been told over and over that Bernard Baruch m ade his fortune by having the courage to “buy when blood is flowing in the streets” – meaning to buy at the time that the future seems th e darkest for the investment in question. This little homily is always dragged out to encoura ge you to buy when an investment has fallen in price (such as with pre cious metals or real estate lately.) But there are two insurmountable di fficulties associated with acting on Baruch’s sure-fire plan for success. The first is a problem I’ve mentioned before. “Bloo d in the streets” is an imprecise term, to say the least. With gold, for example, the blood supposedly was flowing at $400 in 1981 (the price h aving dropped by more than 50%), or at $300 in 1982, or at $400 agai n in 1983. Only the second purchase would still be profitable today – and just barely. The second drawback to the Baruch plan is even more important: You aren’t Bernard Baruch. Is it realistic to think that millions of investors are going to achieve big profits copying the supposed tricks of a man wh o operated 50 years ago – a man with his own unique personality, his own feelings about risk, his own intuitive genius? Could you sing like Luciano Pavarotti just from fol lowing the rules given in a voice textbook?"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 70 Could you emulate Thomas Edison’s creative success just by watching an old Mickey Rooney movie? You can’t graft onto your investment personality th e adages uttered by a financial genius who apparently had an intuitive feel for when a market was about to turn around. Whether you should act boldly when the markets are in disarray has to do with who you are and what your objectives are. I t has very little to do with the exploits of any financial daredevil. WHAT TO DO If you’re determined to multiply what you have seve ral times over, you may have to risk everything. But if that isn’t your goal, a far less audacious plan will do. With everything in its proper place, there’s nothin g wrong with taking some chances. Once you’ve established a safety net for yourself, it makes sense to take a flyer when the odds seem to b e weighted heavily in your favor – provided you understand the investment and the risks you’re taking. That’s why I speculate with the Variable Portfolio – a fund of money I can afford to lose. But this portfolio is completel y divorced from the protective Permanent Portfolio. And the division of funds between them was chosen at a quiet time when no one was sho uting “Opportunity!” in my ear. We’ll take risks, and I expect that we’ll make some small profits, take some small losses, and make a few big profits.

The writer presents a sensible, logical, compelling argument t hat something is inevitable – based on what has gone before and wher e we are now. His case is so plausible and rational that it’s obv ious he must be right. But then you pick up another newsletter and find an other preview of the inevitable – and it’s exactly opposite to the f orecast in the first newsletter. And the second writer’s arguments are j ust as logical, sensible, plausible, and rational as the first writ er’s. Which one are you supposed to believe? The question could be critical. Each writer might b e urging you to invest all your capital in line with his forecast. To choose wrongly could be disastrous. So how do you decide which one of them is right? Mo st likely, neither will be right. Most likely, the future will be some thing quite different from either of the two stories you were told. If you doubt that, simply get out issues of newslet ters or financial journals you received a year ago, two years ago, or longer. Read the futures that the writers laid out for you – and not ice how little of it has come to pass. This isn’t a new phenomenon. The same poor result c an be found for almost any set of forecasts – for any explanations of inevitabilities – of any scenarios described at any time by almost an yone. There are two amazing things about the investment w orld: "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 73 1. Things almost never turn out the way anyone expecte d; and 2. No one acknowledges the fact that things almost nev er turn out the way anyone expected. Despite all the logic, the “proven” system, the rel iance on free-market economics, the superior wisdom – the simple truth i s that very little turns out as investment advisors say things will tu rn out. ECONOMICS In practice, economics doesn’t have the precision o f a physical science. Yet so many people, especially advisors, t ry to treat the art of investing as if it were an exact science. People i n the investment world assume that, as in engineering, investing can rely on a tidy application of cause-and-effect relationships. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case. In the physical sciences, experiments can be conducted with every variable co ntrolled and isolated, so that scientists can be almost positive about what makes something burn, bend, bubble, snap, swing, or stand up straight. Generally, the variables are few enough that the ph ysical sciences can be relied on in practical applications. That’s why most airplanes actually fly and why so few microwave ovens produce ice cubes. In economics, however, every human being is a varia ble. There’s no way to herd them all into a laboratory where scient ists can test people’s reactions to every imaginable set of circu mstances. So economic principles have to be created by reason ing instead of through observable tests. Since there can be no lab oratory experiments, there’s no way to prove an economic principle once and for all . "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 74 We examine history to see if there are events that refute a given principle. But if no refutation is found, the princ iple still is only ‘good until proven otherwise.” The heretofore-unseen vari able that may change the result could be lurking around the corne r right now. Even the best economist doesn’t have a mind so logi cal, so objective that he can be sure an economic “truth” will stand for all time (although most economists like to believe they’re s ure). And even if you could be positive that a given prin ciple would always hold, you don’t have access to all the data (the cu rrent motivations in human beings all over the world) that would enable you to apply a given principle to a specific situation and predict the outcome with certainty. As a result, we know very little about how the econ omic world works. And we know very little about the events taking pla ce right now that will affect tomorrow’s investment prices. FALLE SCENARIOUS Again, if you doubt this assertion, simply get out the stories, forecasts, and schemes written two or three years ago. See how little they resemble what actually occurred. Notice, too, that most of the presentations were we ll thought out. They offered plausible explanations of the state of the world. The forecasts didn’t go awry because someone shot from the hip. Here are some of the more compelling ideas that I’v e seen during the past four years: 1. “Because of the record monetary growth of 1981, inf lation will explode into double digits in 1983, taking gold to a new highs.” Everyone knows that monetary growth leads to price inflation after"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 75 a 2-year time lag, and that price inflation leads t o higher gold prices. But, somehow, the schedule seems to have be en upset. 2. “The U.S. dollar is grossly overpriced in the forei gn exchange markets; foreigners exporting goods to the U.S. wil l be glutted with dollars, causing the dollar to crash soon.” We ’ve been hearing this very plausible argument since 1980. And yet th e U.S. dollar has gone from strength to strength up to this very day. Apparently, there were variables at work beside the U.S. trade deficit, U.S. inflation, historical parities, and the other premi ses upon which the dollar obituaries were prewritten. 3-4. “Interest rates will fall sharply because ‘real’ interest rates are now at unsustainably high levels” and “Interest rat es will rise spectacularly because of the huge federal deficits. ” Somehow both interest rate forecasts failed. There hasn’t been a major move – in either direction – in interest rates sinc e 1982. Treasury bill yields have remained in a range roughly bounded by 8% and 11% for the past two years. 5. “There is a proven, documented, infallible, histori cal link between federal deficits and inflation.” In fiscal 1981, th e federal deficit set an all-time record of $78.9 billion – and has conti nued to grow since then. But in 1984 the price inflation rate is at a 1960s level. 1 6. “The Federal Reserve always boosts the economy by i ncreasing monetary growth during election years.” I probably shouldn’t include this one – since it’s more of a superstitio n than an investment axiom. Nevertheless, monetary growth has been falling steadily since late 1983, and the news these days i s of a slowdown in the economic boom.   1 The 1981 deficit figure is from the Federal Reserve Bulletin, April 1984. Previous deficits were checked for comparison in various Federal Reserve publications."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 76 7. “It is a virtually riskless investment to buy a com modity when its price is less than the cost of production, because the low price causes production to fall - creating a shortage.” E xamples of recent “riskless” investments have been copper at 75 cents in 1981 and 1983 (it’s now under 60 cents); sugar at 10 cents i n 1981, 1982, and 1983 (it’s now under 5 cents); lumber at $160 i n 1983 (it’s now under $140); and others. It should be a humbling experience to look over the se scenarios and others that have appeared in newsletters, financial journals, and the general press during the past few years. It should demonstrate to us how little we know about how the markets work – and how little we know of what is going on throughout the world at an y time. GREAT RECORDS Of course, the Postal Service delivers tons of mail that disputes what I’m saying. You’ve undoubtedly read promotions from investment newsletters – telling of consistent returns of 50% to 100% yearly for the past five years, investments that made 1200% in only four mon ths, and advisors that have called every top and bottom in t he silver market for the past 20 years. If only you’d subscribed to those newsletters instead of the ones you take – think how rich you’d be. Somehow, it seems t hat you’re never subscribing to the right newsletter at the right ti me. But some of the newsletters you do receive may be m aking similar claims right now. You don’t see the claims because the publishers don’t send promotions to people who are already sub scribers. If you could see those promotions, you might discov er that you were supposed to have made 50% to 100% annually over the past five years; you were offered an investment that gained 1200% in on ly four"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 77 months; you were advised of every top and bottom in the silver market for the past 20 years. It’s important to realize that very little of what investment advisors say about their performance records has anything to do with the real world – much less with helping you to make a profit . And you should pay no attention to those claims when trying to dec ide how your investments will be handled. When an advisor tells you that he told people to bu y silver when it was $1.29, he’s probably neglecting to tell you tha t he also told people to buy at $5, $10, $20, even $40 an ounce. An advisor probably is truthful when he tells you t hat he called the bottom of a particular bear market. But the story m ight be more complete if he’d mention that he called the bottom of the same bear market 6 times before he hit the jackpot. When an advisor says with great assurance that his infallible indicators are all positive, that we should open th e door and rush into some market, it would be helpful if he mentioned th at those indicators have been positive before but that his subscribers rushed through the door into an elevator shaft. PREDICTIONS You’ve undoubtedly received a number of newsletter promotions that contain “15 Startling Predictions for 1984-1985.” I t’s a good idea to keep these. Had you done so in the past, you could now pull out the same advisor’s “15 Startling Predictions for 1983” and see how few of those predictions came to pass. I’m one of those people who’s incapable of throwing anything away. I still have every newsletter issue I’ve received sin ce 1970 – several file cabinets full of them. As a result, it’s very easy for me to check claims against reality."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 78 In the Front Page of issue 71 (October 5, 1983), I reprinted “10 startling predictions” an investment advisor made i n mid-1981. Of the 10, there were 2 whose deadlines hadn’t yet expired in 1983, while only one of the remaining 8 had proven to be correc t. Since then, the deadlines for the other 2 have expired, leaving the score at 10% correct. It’s interesting that the one correct prediction wa s: The Social Security system, despite President Reaga n’s best efforts, will face an increasingly desperate situation. The syst em will be saved, but in the only politically feasible way: by massive infusions of new paper money. How could he have lost with that prediction? Unfort unately, he didn’t do so well with more mundane matters – like the dir ection of the gold market. One famous advisor always uses his January issue to deliver his predictions for the coming year. He also tells us h ow well he did last year (without listing those predictions as evidence ). Somehow, year after year, he manages to be 87% right. Obviously, anyone who’s 87% right in his forecasts understands enough about the present and the future to refute my contention that we know very li ttle. I happen to have several years of his forecasts in my file cabinet. And, unfortunately, when I check them against the results, I can’t seem to find a single year when he scored even 50%. In January of this year, he reported that his 1983 forecasts had slipped to a score of only 66% correct. But I could find on ly 36% right – even by giving generous interpretations to the ambiguous forecasts. When I say that no one can predict the future and t hat no one really understands the markets thoroughly, I realize that there are many"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 79 apparent exceptions – cases in which someone appare ntly made a great “call” by telling us in advance that a market was going to turn. But when you put his triumph back into the context from whence it came – buried in a pack of equally weighted predict ions – you realize that his insights wouldn’t have made you rich. THE LONG TERM Some advisors are a bit modest about their abilitie s to spot short-term economic and investment trends, but claim to have b een almost 100% right about long-term trends. I recently heard an advisor give his opinion about something, adding, “But that’s a short-term question, and my batting a verage is only about 60% on short-term matters. On long-term thing s, I’m 90% correct.” (I’m quoting this loosely, from memory.) I’ve followed this man’s work fairly closely since he first started publishing. And I’m not aware of a single long-term prediction he’s made since he started that has come to pass. He has explained to us the way the economy alternat es between rising inflation and recession. He’s explained how common stocks and gold rotate in bull markets. He has explained how inflat ion moves in waves to higher highs and higher lows – with the price of gold following in similar waves. He’s said many other things, but thi s is the heart of his long-term approach; everything else flows from that . And there’s a tendency for us to accept these patterns as truth s ince they’ve recurred so many times. Yet today we have neither rising inflation nor a re cession – nor have we had either of them during the past two years. Af ter the gold runup ended in January 1980, there was no significant bul l market in stocks or gold for over two years. In fact, in only 21 mon ths out of the past 56 months have either stocks or gold been in a bull market. The"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 80 inflation rate is at a 1960s level today. And the g old price is now about where it was five years ago. What long-term trend did the advisor foresee? I can’t read minds any better than I can predict th e future. But I’m full of conjecture, and I can guess why he speaks with s uch assurance. He’s so sure that his long-time predictions will come true that he’s already counted them as correct. The attention the advisor gives to forecasting is d oubly unfortunate, because there’s so much of value he does for his re aders that doesn’t require his posing as a fortune-teller. But to believe that he understands the markets well enough to foresee what’s coming is to expect from him something that’ s impossible for anyone to deliver. Hard-Money Successes It’s believed today that many hard-money advisors w ere correctly aligned with the trends of the 1970s – proving thei r ability to know what’s going on. Unfortunately, a lot of the legend is only romantic retrospect. For example, when silver took off from its price-fi xed level of $1.29 in 1967, doubling to $2.58 by mid-1968, not one har d-money analyst warned that it could go back to $1.29 – but that’s where it was in 1971. In 1974, the only advisors warning that gold could drop by 50% from its peak were those who’d been bearish on gold all along. Investors who had followed the bullish advisors were shocked to see 50% of the value of their investment disappear in 20 months. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 81 And of the advisors who suggested buying silver at $2 to $5, or buying gold at $35 to $200, nearly all have squande red the value of their suggestions by telling us to hang on to the i nvestments through thick and thin – and even telling us to buy more si lver at $30 or more gold at $600. Even buying silver at $2 in 1968 hasn’t turned out to be such a grand idea – if you never sold. The return on Treasury bi lls has actually been better. 4 THE PAST FOUR YEARS Perhaps the best way to see how poorly the long ter m has been anticipated is to look back over the past four year s. The primary economic events have been: 1. A fall in the inflation rate to 1960s levels, witho ut a deflationary collapse. 2. A bear market for gold more than twice as long-live d as any other since gold first rose from $35 in 1968. 3. A scarcity of bull markets in anything – stocks, go ld, foreign currencies, silver, bonds, commodities. 4. A U.S. dollar that has been rising continuously in foreign exchange markets. These past four years represent the most significan t change in the investment environment since stocks ended a 22-year bull market   4 The compound annual return for silver over the last 16 years has been 8.3%, while the average yearly 52-week Treasury bil l yield has been 8.5%. Gold, however, has produced a compound yearly return of 15.5% if bought at $35 in 1968 and held until now. Both silv er and gold could be held without paying current taxes, while T-bill interest would have been taxed yearly. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 82 in 1966. If it’s really possible for investment adv isors to call turns in the markets, to foresee significant changes, and to prepare you for what’s coming, there must be at least one who alert ed us in 1980 to the strange new world that was waiting for us. Who is he? Is there one who even listed these events among the possibilities that we should consider? If so, I don’t know who he is. And to be convinced that someone did foresee these events, I’d have to read all his 1980 work – not his 1984 promotional copy. When I do reread 1980 financial literature, all I f ind are advisors pushing one of three dominant themes: (1) this time inflation won’t pause, it’s going straight up (and gold with it); or (2) we’re now entering the recession phase of the monetary cycles – with inflation and gold down for a year or two while stocks are up; or (3) a deflationary coll apse is just around the corner. The actual outcome was very different from any of t hese three expectations."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 83 PAST, PRESENT, & FUTURE It isn’t just the future that’s unreadable. The pre sent is only a little less mysterious. For example, why are interest rates so high today? Because of the large federal deficits, of course. No, it’s because of the fear of inflation coming back. No, no, it’s because the Fed hasn’t loosened the money supply sufficiently. Even explanations of what’s going on right now vary radically from advisor to advisor. And the rock-solid past is no sure thing either. Hi storians today are still arguing over what caused the Great Depression and the Spanish- American War. ADVISORS & UNCERTAINTY So don’t expect investment advisors to turn economi cs and investing into precise sciences for you. They can’t do it – n o more than you can – despite the wonderful performance records you rea d about. Always remember that: The advisor with the perfect record up to now will lose his touch the moment you start acting on his advice. Past performance is no guide to an advisor’s future profitability because the performance may be fictitious, the desc ription of it may be selective, or the advisor may not even know what he’s claiming. For one very typical example, an advisory firm rece ntly had to downgrade severely its performance claims. The reas on? Apparently, neither the owner of the firm, the advertising writ er, nor even the accountant had known the correct way to compute a “ compound, annual gain.”"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 84 It isn’t that no one has ever called a market turn, or that predictions never come true, or that most advisors lie, or that advisors never make money for their customers. Some advisors do have a feel for the markets. Some do produce more profits for their customers than others do. But you have no way of knowing how much of what’s c laimed is really what happened. You have to take everything y ou read and hear with a grain of salt. I react to claims of great performance records in t he same way I’d react to someone telling me he’s invented a way for humans to fly: maybe so, but I’m not cashing in my airline ticket. Investment advisors can’t provide an escape from un certainty. SYSTEMS Neither can trading systems. Trading systems and indicators are intended to get you into and out of a market with perfect timing. And all system s have wonderful performance records. Unfortunately, we run into the same problem here th at occurs with advisors: The system that has worked perfectly up to now will stop being effective as soon as you start using it. I can think of two reasons for this. One is that a system’s promoter wants so much to be lieve in his system that he overlooks or forgets all its failure s. He’s like the person who believes he’s able to heal himself of any sickn ess by applying his"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 85 own mental power; he simply forgets all the days he spent lying in bed. The other reason stems from the way that indicators are discovered. When you read of a “consistent, infallible” indicat or that has called every turn in the market for the past 25 years, you naturally think that its promoter has used this indicator for 25 years – and that he’s made a great deal of money acting on it. But that isn’t what “consistent, infallible” means. It means the investment analyst sifted through mountains of hist orical data (probably with the aid of a computer) looking for t races of a cause- and-effect relationship, until he found the indicto r that would have worked if it had been used. Then the analyst procla ims the indicator to be “consistent, infallible,” and cites the fact tha t its turnings have always preceded turns in the market. Asked why this indicator should anticipate a market turn, many analysts will say that the “why” isn’t important – since, obviously, it works. Other analysts might rack their brains and c ome up with very imaginative “why”s. Coincidence In most of these cases, the real answer is simply coincidence . Many people won’t accept that answer because they want t o believe that everything is understandable, predictable. But, in fact, coincidences abound in this world. A pattern can be repeated many times for no reason at all - at least no reason known to us. With a computer, it’s easy to d ocument as many recurring patterns as you have time to hear about. But, without an explanation of why a pattern exists, there’s no mor e reason to expect it to continue than there is to expect a roulette w heel to repeat its last ten numbers. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 86 Consequently, when the “infallible” indicator with a 25-year record says “Now!”, investors buy but the market continues to move downward. The advisor will find a way to explain this failure to his audience. But his customers will have been guinea pigs in the “fu rther refinement” of one more infallible indicator. SYSTEM VS. STRATEGY An investment “system” is different from an investm ent “strategy.” A system is an automatic mechanism that tells you, with no room for doubt, when to get in and out of markets. For example, one system is to compare the trading v olume in call options to the trading volume in put options. Suppo sedly, a ratio below a specified low level indicates that bearish sentiment is excessive and that the market is about to turn upwa rd. A ratio above a certain high level indicates that the market is abo ut to turn downward. Unfortunately, the good results for any system usua lly have occurred before you start using it. A strategy is a method for making investment decisions – an approach to investing, a way of looking at things, a way of evaluating risks, a method for deciding when the odds are in y our favor, and for acting when you’ve made that decision. For example, one investor may have captured a profi t of 40% in one year, while a second investor had a return of 10%, or broke even, or even had a small loss. The first investor didn’t ne cessarily have the “best” strategy. He may, for example, have risked 8 0% of his capital on his investments – something the second investor maybe couldn’t afford to do. Given enough years (maybe only one or two), the first"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 87 investor may have no capital left – despite his imp ressive return the first year. A few examples of strategy are given at the end of this article. Luck Even the best strategy in the world, tailor-made fo r you alone, won’t guarantee success – because there’s always an eleme nt of luck in your investment results. “Luck” is a dirty word among “scientific” market tr aders. But there’s no way to get away from it. To say that luck doesn’t enter into your investment results is to say that you control everything that happens – and that you have knowledge of everything that could affect the resul t. Obviously, you don’t. Luck is the result of all the elements you don’t control and can’t have timely knowledge of. If thes e unknowable elements happen to line up against you, your luck i s bad. If they work for you, your luck is good. And no matter how dilig ent you or your advisor are, there’s no way to turn all the unknown s into knowns. A good strategy can’t eliminate luck. But a good st rategy can help you to capitalize on good luck and minimize the losses caused by bad luck. Incidentally, when I say that no one can predict th e future, people sometimes bring up my 1970 book How You Can Profit from the Coming Devaluation (a pretentious book by an immature young man). “How do you explain,” the argument goes, “that you correctly forecast the devaluation of the dollar?” The answer is simple. It was my turn to be lucky."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 88 ADVISORS’ STRENGTHS Please don’t assume that the purpose of this articl e is to point out the follies of my competitors. If there were any way to leave advisors’ performances out of this, I would do so. The point of the article is that none of us can kno w enough about the past, present, or future to invest with certainty. Consequently, it is vital that we have a strategy for dealing with unce rtainty and with our own ignorance. But that point is disputed daily by the claims of advisors and the unexamined assumptions of investor s. So I can’t make the point without also dealing with those clai ms and assumptions. Neither should you gather from what I’ve said that I think investment advisors are useless. In fact, they can be a big he lp to you. One thing an advisor offers is his knowledge. Some of it is knowledge of his craft – knowing the conventions and ordinary practices of the markets or the tax rules governing a particular kin d of transaction. Other knowledge is of the many alternatives availab le to investors – so that he can give you the ability to choose among several ways to accomplish your objectives. Or he may know ways to hedge against risks that are making you uncomfortable. The advisor might have a better feel for how the wo rld works than you do – or at least better training in logic. He m ight be able to spot fallacies in arguments that seem convincing to you. The advisor also can offer theoretical knowledge. A lthough no one can hope to understand everything about what makes markets move, an advisor should have had the time to understand a great deal more than you do. And this theoretical understanding all ows him to see that"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 89 some ideas and hopes are unrealistic. In this way, he can be a filter for bad ideas – perhaps saving you from expensive mista kes. He also may be able to spot an investment that has a realistic chance to pay off, and show you how to invest in it with l imited risk. And if the investment is a winner, he may be able to recognize before you d o that the risk-reward ratio, once so favorable to yo u, is turning against you as the price rises. He may get you out in time to save your profits simply by reminding you that, to succeed, you have to get out at some point. An advisor can do research that you don’t have the time or background to perform. And if he explains his work properly, you can decide for yourself whether to act on what he has u ncovered. He also offers objectivity. He should be able to ap praise your portfolio without the emotional interest in it that you have. Understandably, you feel that anything you’ve already bought must go up, and so you tend to see only the bullish side – and ignore the infor mation that might tell you that you’re overinvested in some things. The ad visor views your portfolio as an outsider; he doesn’t have to argue on behalf of your past decisions. But don’t expect him to be able to tell you how muc h profit your portfolio will make (and don’t believe him if he tr ies to tell you). His analysis should be aimed at seeing whether you’re o verinvested in something, what risks you face, whether you’ve chos en the investments that best match your objectives and you r opinions about the future. The advisor should be a teacher, too. He should edu cate you in the development of strategies that fit your knowledge, interests, wealth, and temperament. ADVISORS’ DRAWBACKS"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 90 Investment advisors also have their drawbacks. Instead of filtering out bad ideas, some advisors p roduce them. They promote sure-fire, get-rich-quick schemes that don’ t work. As in any business, there are many advisors who are n’t original thinkers – who simply relay the ideas of others. An d sometimes those ideas live on, in repackaging after repackaging, lo ng after their usefulness has ended. And, in some cases, an advisor has no knowledge at all to offer you – only an ideological commitment to precious metals o r to some other icon. Instead of dealing with the details and speci fics that you need, he offers only grand thoughts and slogans. His fervor distorts, his efforts at research, so that he “discovers” only those nugg ets that support his predetermined point of view. Too often an advisor is carrying last years predict ions around on his back. The advisor who’s guaranteed that gold is goi ng to $2,000 is the last person in the world to evaluate whether you’re over-invested in gold. All you’ll hear from him are clichés about fe deral deficits and inflation. An advisor should help you understand risk and mana ge it properly. But to many advisors, “limited risk” doesn’t mean a stop-loss or another defined way of limiting your losses; it mea ns “there’s no chance for the price to drop more than 10%.” Most everyone, advisors included, pays lip service to the concept of uncertainty. But phrases like “Of course, no one ca n be certain” or “No one has a crystal ball” are too often used only to give an impression of prudence – while the advisor encourag es you to fling everything you own into the pot for some sure-fire investment. Unlimited Wealth"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 91 Another problem is that, to most investment advisor s, your circumstances and your wealth aren’t real. You’re j ust part of the audience that he can see only dimly through the foo tlights. In the movie A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy , when Woody Allen is asked what he does for a living, he replies: “I’ m an investment advisor; I help people with their money until it’s gone.” Actually, in an advisor’s view of the world, your m oney is never gone. You have unlimited funds. The advisor puts yo u into this investment and into that investment and then into s omething else. And when he comes up with a new sure thing, he doesn’t bother to tell you where the new money is to come from or which of the sure things already recommended must be sold. He tells you to commit your funds to a bandwagon th at is starting to move and won’t wait. “This is your last chance to b uy at these prices!” But then the price goes down. He never say s, “It didn’t work, we should cut our losses and get out.” Instead, he says, “Wonderful! This is what I was hoping for – an opportunity to b uy more at bargain prices!” Buy more? With what? You’ve already used up everyth ing – buying on his recommendation at much higher prices. Unlike Woody Allen, when all the money is gone, the advisor assumes that you can open another dresser drawer an d pull out another pile of money. In his world, you’ll always have unlimited funds to act on his fantasies. Your losses simply are not real to an investment ad visor. He is right, he has the best record, he is the authority – no ma tter what happens.

CONTRARY OPINION How do you deal with this? If an advisor can perfor m a useful function, how do you tap his strengths without bein g pulled down by his weaknesses? One way is to be exposed to advisors with differing views. If your favorite advisor is very bullish on gold, be sure t o subscribe to a newsletter that’s bearish on gold. Whenever you get a strong feeling about something, search out people who disagree. This is in keeping with the original meaning of Hum phrey Neill’s “Theory of Contrary Opinion” – to pay attention to opinions that are contrary to your own . That makes sense, and it’s a far cry from the over-simplified “system” that “contrary opinion” ha s become – the idea that the majority is always wrong, so that you can get rich simply"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 93 by acting contrary to the majority. 5 If you’re sure gold is now in a new bull market, tr y to imagine all the ways the bull market could be aborted. And once you ’ve realized that the uptrend isn’t a sure thing, ask yourself what e vent would prove you wrong and cause you to bail out. That brand of contrary opinion simply respects the first rule of investing, which is: Anything can happen. And its corollary: There is nothing that has to happen. Often, at investment seminars with many speakers, s omeone says to me, “I came here to find out what to do about my in vestments, but now I’m more confused than ever.” To which, I have to reply, “Good.” If you’re confus ed, you won’t do anything dangerous or silly. It’s when you’ve found a sure thing, when you’re certain that something must happen, tha t you’re in trouble. If one advisor can demonstrate that more inflation is inevitable while another advisor can prove that a deflation is comin g, you won’t bet everything you have in one direction or the other. Instead, you’ll try to prepare for both possibilities.   5 The original theory is presented in The Art of Contrary Thinking by Humphrey B.

UNCERTAIN WORLD The beginning of investment wisdom is to realize th at we live in an uncertain world, that we don’t know enough about ho w markets work, that we don’t even understand the present fully, mu ch less the future. This uncertainty is a problem only when you try to deny its existence. In every other area of your life, you deal easily w ith uncertainty. You don’t rely on a fortune teller to tell you how your business will do next year, what your relationship with your spouse will be, who your daughter is going to marry. You know that those thi ngs are unpredictable, and you rely on a philosophy of life that doesn’t demand predictability. The investment world is no different. No one can re ad tea leaves here either. There is simply a lot of talk about things that don’t really happen. No matter what advice you receive, expect to be sur prised – because you will be. Over and over again, A is supposed to lead to B, but instead it leads to C or gets swallowed up by D. To me, the actual results are humbling. It reminds me, over and over again, how little I understand about how the world works – how little I know of natural law. I believe many things. I have opinions on almost an ything you want to discuss. But events keep telling me I know very little. We live in a vast world that none of us can fully u nderstand. We learn"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 95 throughout our lives, but we are only chipping away at the ignorance – not eliminating it. Growing Up Throughout your entire life, you are only trying to grow up – to understand how to act, how to think, what to do to get what you want. Every year, you look back and say, “I didn’t unders tand everything last year, but now I won’t make those mistakes agai n.” And you won’t make those mistakes again. You’ll make new ones. Every once in a while, I’m perceptive enough to rem ind myself that, if last year’s ideas seem so immature today, today’s i deas may not look so hot next year. HOW YOU LIVE The fact that we live in an uncertain world doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do about your investments. You’ve m anaged to deal with the rest of your life successfully – in areas offering no more certainty than the investment markets offer. In the real world, no one guarantees that you’ll ha ve a job forever. But that doesn’t stop you from working and earning a go od living. Nor does anyone guarantee that your loved one will be with you always, but that doesn’t stop you from enjoying eac h other today, tomorrow, next month, next year. Despite the uncertainty, you know there are ways to succeed in every other area of your life. Why not with investments a s well? "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 96 When you enter the investment markets, you aren’t e ntering a Twilight Zone where reality is overruled. The marke ts are part of the same real world in which you’ve made all your other decisions. You cope in the real world because you’ve developed a philosophy of life that helps you to make decisions without perfe ct knowledge of the consequences. You can do the same in the investment markets if you’ve developed a strategy for making investments without perfect knowledge of the results. And as with your philosophy of life, that strategy should restrain you from going overboard, from letting enthusiasm run a way with you – even as it allows you to be as speculative or as ca utious as you choose to be. Your strategy – as with your philosophy – should be formulated to take advantage of your strengths and your interests , without requiring that your weaknesses disappear. MYSTICS Many people are unwilling to accept the world as it is.

They offer no explanation of human cause and effect at work. As with any mystical system, the only explanation is, “It w orks.” But, of course, it rarely seems to work when your money is at stake. They want to believe they’ve found the secret in El liott waves, or in Kondratieff waves, or in the conspiracies of stock exchange specialists, or in meetings of the Trilateral Commi ssion, or in January barometers. They consecrate indicators, such as “relative stren gth,” that tell you where you should have been invested last month. They draw triangles and squares. They worship Fibon acci numbers and – most of all – the “golden” number 1.618. 6 A common thread through most of these mystical syst ems is the invocation of mathematics. But economics deals with qualitative, not quantitative, relationships. To paraphrase Francis Bacon, a little mathematics i s a dangerous thing. Ludwig von Mises said that every economist s hould have a   6 Leonardo Fibonacci (1170-1230) was an Italian mathe matician who devised a numerical sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 1 3, 21, 34, 55 . . . etc., in which each number is the sum of the two pr eceding numbers. Modern mystics believe that the numbers I the seque nce are market tools.

If you fail to see the divine purpose in all thi s, Fibonacci buffs deliver the coup de grace – the fact that the resul t of dividing any number in the sequence by its predecessor is approx imately 1.618 (55 divided by 34 = 1.618).

Safety, profit, and peace of mind begin the day you quit wishing you could find an in fallible system and start devising a strategy based on uncertainty. STRATEGIES My strategies of the past six or seven years have b een described in my last two books and in many articles in this newslet ter. The heart of my approach is to separate the money y ou’re trying to conserve from the money you’re willing to risk for the sake of bigger profits – separating your capital between what I ca ll the Permanent Portfolio and the Variable Portfolio. For the Permanent Portfolio, it’s important that yo u don’t bet everything on one outcome – that you protect yourse lf against uncertainty instead of just giving lip service to c aution. The use of “leveraged” hedges (very volatile invest ments that could triple or quadruple while only risking the amount i nvested) is a good example of the use of a strategy to accomplish an o bjective – in this   7 Paraphrased from his statement on page 4 of The Ult imate Foundation of economic Science, 1962 Van Nostrand edition."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 99 case, the objective of being protected in several d irections without immobilizing the portfolio. For the Variable Portfolio, it’s important to have a basis for deciding when to invest in something – not just when somethi ng “ought to go up,” but when you see a good reason that the potent ial gain can be several times what you’re risking. And it’s importa nt to define precisely what is being risked – not through a poin tless guess as to how far the price can drop, but by deciding how far you’ll let it drop before you get out. An implicit part of any realistic strategy (to me) is the recognition that the investment opportunity you see isn’t something that will happen – but something that has a higher-than-average chance to happen. The difference between those two approaches is crucial to making the proper arrangements for the investment. These are brief examples of elements of my investme nt strategy. Although I’ve discussed them over the years, the pr esentation has been fragmented – as various parts have been descri bed to deal with current questions or objectives. These ideas need to be consolidated, as well as pol ished in a number of respects. So I plan to publish a new series of a rticles integrating the strategies for dealing with an uncertain investment world – setting forth the principles I believe underlie the use of both the Permanent Portfolio and the Variable Portfolio. These article s should appear in the next few issues. 8 IT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US I’d like to close this lengthy article by showing y ou that I do understand how authoritative and compelling investm ent advice   8 Meanwhile, the article “Forecasting vs Strategy” co vers a lot of the Variable Portfolio strategy."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 100 sometimes can be – how strongly you can be made to feel that if you don’t act now, you’re going to miss the boat. Last February, I met for the first time an advisor whose work I’ve read and respected for many years. In our conversation, I said, “Isn’t it funny how many times during the past few years vari ous advisors have announced the beginning of a new bull market i n gold?” He said, “Yes, many people have jumped the gun.” And then he added, “But you know, the bull market d id begin today.” At first I thought he was kidding, but then I reali zed he was serious and I stopped giggling. “Today? Why do you think th at?” I asked. “Well, the London fix was over $390, the 5-week mov ing average finally rose above the 13-week average, ...” etc. For the past 40 years, I’ve been the secretary-trea surer of the National Organization of Worldly Agnostic Youth (NOWAY). You know me, I’m skeptical of everything . But I must admit that, as I sat there listening to him, I thought to myself. “Am I missin g out on something? Should I run home, call my Swiss bank, w rite a Special Bulletin?” Needless to say, I sobered up. And needless to say, a new bull market in gold didn’t start last February. But if I can be moved by such authority, I well und erstand how you can get stampeded sometimes by plausible, compellin g claims – how it can seem that someone knows what’s about to happen and you’d better pay attention. But that someone is just a human being like you and me. He meets his margin calls one leg at a time, just as you do.

This article introduces, in general terms, my strat egy for investing in an uncertain world. Future articles will provide th e specifics. I believe this strategy best fits the kind of world we live in. It’s aimed at safety and profit without depending on anyone’s ability to foresee the future. I’m sure I’ll continue to amend it as I learn more. I might even trade it for a better one someday. And yet one of its charac teristics is its apparent timelessness. I believe this strategy woul d have been suitable during the 1920s, 1950s, or any other period I know about. So it stands a good chance of being just as applicable in the 1990s or 2000s. EXPECTATIONS Even though you live in an uncertain world, you sti ll have expectations. You can’t look at the present without forming an expectation about what is going to happen next, and it would be unreasonable to ask someone to ignore what he think s that future is likely to bring. But what you expect to happen is only that – an expectation, not an event already recorded in the history books. You don’t have to ignore your expectations for the future. On the contrary, you won’t be happy unless you act on them . But you should"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 103 do so with limits and restraints, and with a plan f or controlling the damage when you’re wrong. By recognizing that an opinion about the future is only an opinion, and not a revelation of the future, you’ll act on i t in a safer way. And the safer way leads to much greater success than if you bet the ranch every time you think you know what’s coming tomorro w. TWO PORTFOLIOS I believe the most important way in which you can a cknowledge the uncertainty of the future is by separating your inv estment capital into two portfolios. I call these the Permanent Portfoli o and the Variable Portfolio. A portfolio is simply a collection of investments – such as a number of different stocks, a quantity of gold, parcels of real estate, cash, etc. The Permanent Portfolio is a balanced collection of long-term investments. Its purpose is to assure that you’re f inancially safe no matter what the future brings. It accomplishes this through a special plan for diversification that’s discussed later in this article. The Permanent Portfolio can be slanted toward your general opinion about the long-term course of the economy, but it s hould be arranged so that you won’t be hurt badly if it turns out tha t your expectations are wrong. The Permanent Portfolio, once in place, is meant to remain virtually unchanged for several years. You don’t alter it as the economy bounces from recession to prosperity to inflation. The primary concern of the Permanent Portfolio is s afety. But if the portfolio is properly constructed, it can produce a profit as well. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 104 The Variable Portfolio, on the other hand, is funde d with money you can afford to lose. It is a separate portfolio, wit h which you attempt to capitalize on shorter-term investment trends. Its i nvestments change as you see the opportunities for profit changing. The contents of the two portfolios don’t have to be physically separate. For example, you might have a single acco unt at a money market fund for $20,000 – of which $15,000 is part of your Permanent Portfolio and $5,000 is part of your Variable Portf olio. The important thing is to treat the two portfolios separately when you make investment decisions. Each has its own purpose and its own rules. For example, if someone convinces you that “Bonds a re a terrific buy at these prices,” you’d consider whether the Variab le Portfolio should make an investment in bonds now. You wouldn’t alter the Permanent Portfolio’s bond holdings – no matter how strongly you felt about the near-term future for bonds. Value of Two Portfolios The separation of your assets into two portfolios m ay seem to be a mere formality. But I believe it’s a vital part of the strategy for dealing with an uncertain world. It identifies a certain portion of your assets as e ligible for betting on the future – and restricts and protects the rest of your assets. Without that separation, all of your capital is exposed to the hazards of mistaken forecasts, ill-timed speculations, hot tip s, and your own runaway enthusiasm. For example, when your favorite investment advisor says, “Now is the time to throw caution to the wind and bet everythin g on a new bull market in gold,” he may decide to mortgage his home and bet everything. But you can keep your caution out of th e wind – and limit"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 105 your bet to all or a portion of your Variable Portf olio. If the future turns out to have been less certain than the adviso r believed, you’ll have lost only what you could afford to lose. Of course, if it turns out that he was right – righ t in every detail – your profits won’t be as great as if you’d traded your P ermanent Portfolio for a gold bar. But, unfortunately, you don’t know in advance whether this is the one correct by signal out of th e many that will be announced. No matter how earnest you may be about limiting ris k, keeping all your capital in one portfolio makes it too easy to overspeculate. Every time a new speculative opportunity arises, yo u’ll reopen the question of how much of your capital is available f or speculation. And the chances are great that your answer will be dete rmined by how strongly you feel about the current speculation – n ot by how much you can afford to lose. THE PERMANENT PORTFOLIO The first purpose of the Permanent Portfolio is to preserve your capital no matter what economic environment descend s upon us – more inflation, runaway inflation, an end to inflat ion, deflation, prosperity, whatever. In the real world, there’s no one course of action that could assure your financial survival through every conceivable e ventuality. But you should be able, through moderate diversificatio n, to be 99% sure that your capital will survive just about anything short of an event that destroys civilization. This safety is achieved by making sure that any fut ure economic climate will cause at least one of the portfolio’s investments to be a big winner. And the profit in the winning investmen ts must be great enough to offset losses in the other investments. "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 106 To make this possible, the Permanent Portfolio shou ld favor investments that are highly volatile – that move gr eat distances, up or down, as conditions change. Over a period of severa l years, the profits in the winners are likely to be several hundred per cent, while the worst loser can’t lose more than 100% of its starti ng value. Thus one winner can outweigh a number of losing inv estments – creating a net profit overall. During the 1970s, fo r example, the gold in a Permanent Portfolio gained 300%, 400%, or more – far overshadowing losses of 30% to 50% in the stocks an d bonds in the portfolio. In addition to offering volatility, the Permanent P ortfolio’s investments must be tied closely to specific econom ic climates. Four particular investments offer these virtues, and thu s are essential to the portfolio: 1. Gold – to profit during periods when the inflation rate is rising; 2. Stock market investments – for periods of declining inflation and/or general prosperity; 3. Long-term Treasury bonds – for periods when interes t rates are declining, such as during most periods of falling i nflation rates and especially after a deflation; 4. Treasury bills – the one non-volatile investment, i n order to provide liquidity, to offer some stability during p eriods when no investments are doing well (such as 1980-1982), and to provide purchasing power appreciation during periods of low inflation or deflation. These investments are the cornerstones of the portf olio – because each has a strong and clear link to a specific economic environment. "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 107 The portfolio might also include real estate, silve r, foreign currencies, a business, or any other long-term investment that seems right to you. However, these investments aren’t essential to a Pe rmanent Portfolio. They should be included only to achieve a small add itional degree of diversification, or when you believe an investment is available at a bargain price in a long-term sense, or when needed for tax advantages. If you arrange the Permanent Portfolio thoughtfully , it can remain relatively unchanged for many years – and should re quire only minor attention about once a year or so. It should be a p ortfolio you can walk away from without ever having to fear that it has b ecome inappropriate for the times. And it should be so we ll-balanced that no news item can make you feel vulnerable. If you rely on your investments for living expenses , it’s the Permanent Portfolio that generates the cash you need – since it’s the Permanent Portfolio that’s designed for reliability. The cash may come from interest and dividends earned by the portfolio, or it may come from selling small amounts of profitable investments. THE VARIABLE PORTFOLIO The Variable Portfolio begins with a supply of cash . It continues to be 100% in cash until you see an attractive speculatio n – at which time some or all of the portfolio’s cash might be put in to that investment. A Variable Portfolio investment might be very short -term – such as a trade that’s expected to last only a few days in th e futures markets. Or it might be medium-term – a bet that an item is now in a bull market that could last for six months, a year, or more. Be cause of its format, the newsletter’s Variable Portfolio investments are invariably of the latter time frame, but there are no rules against v ery-short-term investments. At times, the portfolio might be divided among two or more investments. But when nothing is attractive, the Va riable Portfolio"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 108 remains in cash – which might be in the form of Tre asury bills or a money market fund invested in Treasury securities. The Variable Portfolio on occasion might be investe d in an item that’s also in the Permanent Portfolio. If so, the item se rves a different purpose in each of the two portfolios. It’s in the Permanent Portfolio because of the long-term protection it provides; it ’s temporarily in the Variable Portfolio because you expect it to appreci ate – and soon. It’s important to have a specific strategy for the Variable Portfolio – rather than simply betting it on whatever plausible story comes along. You need a way to evaluate potential investments wi thin the context of all your speculations – not as if a potential in vestment were the only one you’ll ever make. A future article will outline the strategy I use fo r managing the Variable Portfolio. The Variable Portfolio should be funded with money you can afford to lose. If properly handled, you probably won’t lo se all of it – even if every one of your speculative investments turns out badly. But it would be foolish to speculate with money that’s pre cious to you. DIVISION BETWEEN THE PORTFOLIOS The first important decision concerns how you’ll sp lit your capital between the two portfolios. The answer comes from two considerations: 1. How much of your capital you’re willing to risk. 2. How confident you are that you can manage the Varia ble Portfolio profitably. "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 109 It isn’t essential that you have a Variable Portfol io. For some people, it’s better to have 100% in the Permanent Portfolio and nothing in the Variable Portfolio. This is the best situation if y ou have no interest in short-term speculations, or if you don’t have the c ompetence or the time to speculate intelligently, or if everything y ou have now is precious to you. If you don’t now have capital you can afford to los e, you shouldn’t set up a Variable Portfolio until your net worth has in creased to the point that you feel you have a surplus to risk. If you have funds you can risk and you’d like to ha ve a Variable Portfolio, but aren’t sure how well you’ll do with it, you might put 10% or 20% of your net worth (up to the limit you’r e willing to lose) into the Variable Portfolio. If you’re anxious to s peculate and can afford to jump in with both feet, you might have mu ch more in the Variable Portfolio. After you’ve determined how much of what you have n ow is precious to you, leave more than that in the Permanent Portf olio. There are bound to be periods when the portfolio will depreci ate in value. Between 1980 and 1982, for example, virtually all i nvestments except Treasury bills declined in value. During such times , any portfolio except one that’s mostly in cash has to decline in value also. So if you decide that, say, 50% of your net worth i s precious to you, you might leave 65% in the Permanent Portfolio and put 35% in the Variable Portfolio. Naturally, it’s better to make the division between the two portfolios at a time when you don’t have a specific speculatio n in mind. Undistracted by the scent of hoped-for gain, you’re better able to weigh the subjective balance between risk and possi ble profit. In fact, a big advantage of having two portfolios i s that it will have been during a time of calm that you decided how muc h you can afford"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 110 to risk – not when someone’s yelling in your ear to jump at a once-in- a-lifetime chance to make your fortune. This, in turn, permits you to be more aggressive wi th the Variable Portfolio. Knowing that you aren’t risking the fami ly jewels, you can be as daring as you want to be. No matter what happ ens, you know you have a safety net – the Permanent Portfolio – u nderneath you. Testing the Division After you’ve made the division between the two port folios and have lived with it for a while, you can apply three test s to find out whether the division is right: 1. How would you feel if the entire Variable Portfolio were wiped out? If such a loss would disrupt your life and lea d to drastic changes in your plans, then your Variable Portfolio is too large. 2. Do you find that the Variable Portfolio is never fu lly invested? If so, this may be a sign that it’s too large – since you may be unwilling to risk it all. (It’s also possible, howe ver, that your Variable Portfolio hasn’t been fully invested becau se you haven’t yet found opportunities that are attractive enough. This has been the case for the newsletter for most of the past fo ur years.) 3. Have you dragged your feet in setting up a balanced and diversified Permanent portfolio because you’re wait ing for investment prices to change? This may be a sign tha t your Variable Portfolio is too small - since you’re actually spec ulating on future prices with money that you’d allocated to the Perma nent Portfolio. (It also may mean that you don’t fully accept the P ermanent Portfolio concept.) TRANSFERS BETWEEN PORTFOLIOS "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 111 If investment losses reduce the value of your Varia ble Portfolio, you might be tempted to refinance it by drawing on the Permanent Portfolio. This would be a big mistake. New money for the Variable Portfolio should come on ly from one of these sources: 1. Profits on investments made with existing Variable Portfolio capital; 2. Gifts or income from outside your investments; 3. Increases in value in the Permanent Portfolio that create additional funds you’re willing to lose. Only if the Permanent Portfolio is generating profi ts should you draw money from it to replenish the Variable Portfo lio. And you need to be careful not to overestimate the Permanen t Portfolio’s surplus. On the other hand, if the Variable Portfolio is suc cessful, you may want to transfer some of its profits to the Permane nt Portfolio. Even though it’s money you could afford to lose, you may want to “bank” some of your profits. You don’t have to be like the casino gambler who keeps betting his winnings until he’s finally l ost everything. You may also want to withdraw some of the Variable Portfolio profits to spend on yourself and your family. Transfers of funds between the portfolios, if any, should always be governed by the same basic standard that controls t he original division of assets between the two portfolios: How much are you willing to place at risk by betting on your judgment about nea r-term market trends? SPECULATION AND SAFETY"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 112 I realize that most people give lip service to unce rtainty and to the need to control risk. But, having said the right things, many people make investments that indicate great confidence and little humility. Often this happens because the difference between s afety and speculation hasn’t been defined. With many investment strategies, you’re told that s afety comes only from outguessing the future (which is speculation, no matter what it’s called) – that you must bet everything on inflation , or on deflation, or on how many photos the Chinese will take or on some thing else. If things don’t work out as expected, you pick up what ever pieces are left and start over again from scratch. Other strategies aren’t based on a single long-term bet. Instead, you’re told that safety comes from agility – from moving q uickly from one investment to another as the economic climate chang es. This leads to a series of speculations in which you stake everything - over and over again – on someone’s ability to read the situation correctly. One or two wrong guesses and you may hav e to start your financial career all over again – with a small frac tion of what you have now. Somehow, this strategy also bears the “sa fety” label. I believe it’s possible to create a portfolio that’ s much less vulnerable to the world’s uncertainties than is the idea that someone (you or an advisor) will always guess right about the future. And that portfolio – the Permanent Portfolio – should be keep separate, out of reach of tinkering hands, unavailable for bets on the latest forecast. It isn’t foolish to speculate. But I want to specul ate intelligently – betting only with money I can afford to lose and on ly when the odds seem to be stacked in my favor.

But our protectors at the Securities & Exchang e Commission (SEC) will keep us safe from harm. Being against insider trading is like being against sin or being for apple pie. No decent, God-fearing person wants to s ee insiders take advantage of honest investors. Unfortunately, apple isn’t one of my favorite pies, and I’m not even sure I’m against sin. So I’m having trouble getting myself worked up about insider trading. The current pronouncements are consistent with the great American philosophy: “If you don’t get what you want, sue so mebody.” Whatever happens, don’t take responsibility for you r own life. Investors shouldn’t have to think for themselves, a nd they shouldn’t have to feel responsible for their investment losse s. There are bad men out there who took advantage of them. The insider scandals have raised again the concept of the “level playing field.” We’re all supposed to compete on th e level playing field of life — in which, I suppose, no one has the advantage of being able to run downhill. I guess this means that all f inanciers will have to go to the same school of business, and all doctors will have to go to the same medical school — to avoid giving anyone an unfair advantage over his competitor. There are so many mistaken assumptions and fallacie s in the current insider witch hunt that it’s hard to know where to start. "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 115 Zero Sum Games In the first place, investors are not necessarily c ompeting with one another. The investment markets are not “zero sum g ames” in which one player’s gain is offset by a loss to someone el se. If they were, they would have faded out of existence years ago — repla ced by casinos that offered free drinks as you gamble. When two people exchange money and stock, the trans action is not much different from two people exchanging money and doughnuts — a mutually profitable exchange. No economist in his right mind would call the two people “competitors” or attempt to ide ntify which is the “winner” and which the “loser.“ If a man buys a stock at $30 and sells it at $42 to another man who later sells it at $51, which is the winner and whic h is the loser? The answer is self-evident. Each is a winner, and e ach unintentionally helps the other as he pursues his own goals. It’s j ust like any other free market transaction. What if one of those two investors had “inside” inf ormation? By competing on a tilted playing field, did he hurt th e other investor? Let’s suppose Mr. Outsider bought the stock at $30 and then decided on June 1 to sell — and did so at $42. Mr. Insider obtained some very special information on June 1 about something that would occur on June 10. So he bought at $42 from Mr. Outsider. On June 10 the expected event occurred on schedule, the price jump ed to $51, and Mr. Insider sold and took his profit. The fairness buff sees this example and concludes t hat Mr. Insider made his profit at the expense of Mr. Outsider. But that assumes, even if it’s not recognized, that Mr. Outsider sold only because Mr. Insider wanted to buy. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 116 In fact, Mr. Outsider sold for his own reasons. If he hadn’t sold to Mr. Insider, he would have sold to someone else. And if Mr. Insider’s presence in the market had any effect upon Mr. Outs ider, it must be that Mr. Outsider received a higher price for his s tock than if Mr. Insider hadn’t been bidding for it. No, says the fairness buff, you don’t understand; M r. Insider should have made his information public before he bought t he stock. But if Mr. Insider had to make public his informati on, he wouldn’t buy the stock at all — since the price would alread y have risen by the time he could buy. And if he can’t buy the stock wi thout revealing the information, he probably won’t bother to do either. So Mr. Outsider still would have sold his stock at $42. Mr. Insider didn’t cost Mr. Outsider anything. So h ow would a level playing field make Mr. Outsider any better off? (Ev en if Mr. Outsider sells at a loss, the principle is the same. He woul d have had the same loss if Mr. Insider had stayed out of the market.) Wait a minute — we’re forgetting someone. What abou t Mr. Latecomer — the poor guy who bought Mr. Insider’s s tock at $51, at the very top? Mr. Insider didn’t make the stock rise to $51; he d idn’t create the event that caused the price rise; he only profited from it. The stock would have gone up in any case — and Mr. Latecomer would have lost in any case. The essence of the insider-trading argument is the idea that no one should have access to help that you and I don’t hav e. But everyone’s situation is different. Some people have better com puters, subscribe to more newsletters, get phone calls in the middle of the night warning them of market crashes, have a better feel for the market, get better executions from their brokers, receive free advice from their brothers- in-law, and in many other ways enjoy unfair advanta ges. Where do we"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 117 draw the line? Heard in the Alley The Foster Winans case was a landmark in government efforts to protect the public. Mr. Winans wrote the “Heard on the Street” column f or The Wall Street Journal . The column reported good or bad opinions about individual stocks — opinions coming from “savvy” Wa ll Street traders. He had a roommate who knew in advance what the colu mn would say. The roommate and a broker conspired, with Mr. Winans’ knowledge, to buy ahead of time the stocks that wer e to be touted in the articles. As such, they supposedly made profits on this inside information. If their profits came at any investors’ expense, it would have to be those who bought a stock after an article appeared — because the roommate’s advance purchase would have made the sto ck slightly more expensive than it would have been otherwise. But so what? A basic investment rule is never to buy an investme nt because of the publication of good news. It will be a tough job to protect investors who think they can get rich by buying stocks touted in The Wall Street Journal — because those people need a lot more protection than just the elimination of insider trading. "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 118 Employers & Employees Since The Wall Street Journal is a respectable newspaper, it’s not likely to look kindly on employees who get involved in such schemes. For one reason, it wouldn’t want the columnist choo sing stocks for his columns according to how well they suit his private scam. And so one would expect The Journal to have rules about such things — as in fact it does. If it didn’t, Investor’s Business Daily could gain an edge by providing a similar column with more use ful information. The situation is similar for law firms, accounting firms, investment banks, and other companies whose employees might be aware of sensitive information. It’s bad for business to bec ome known as a company that can’t keep a secret. (Look at the CIA. ) So most of these companies require employees to sig n secrecy agreements. They are even in a position to sue form er employees who have violated their oaths. And that’s the real point. The injured party isn’t an investor rolling down a tilted playing field. The “victim” is the co mpany whose employee has violated his contract. In the Ivan Boesky case, the culprit is the individ ual who sold Mr. Boesky information that the culprit had promised no t to reveal. And the victim is the company that person worked for. A s such. it is properly a civil matter, not a criminal. So why do we need SEC storm troopers to regulate wh at insiders do? Victims?

The newest victim is the investor who is being deni ed his rights under the 37th Amendment, to wit: “No investment exchange , dealer, or broker shall deny a level playing field to any inve stor.” After all, a lone investor is helpless. How can one person by hi mself hope to compete with the Ivan Boeskys of this world? Actually, that’s one reason we have mutual funds pe nsion funds, commodity pools, limited partnerships, money manage rs, financial broadcasting, and (dare I say it?) investment newsl etters. All these things enable an investor to have professional help . If someone loses money continually in the investmen t markets, it isn’t because there are insiders, arbitrageurs, market-ma king specialists, floor traders, scalpers, raiders, or other bogeymen . He loses money because he isn’t a competent investor. No matter wh at laws are passed, he’ll continue to lose money until he learn s to be a better investor or he delegates the job to someone more co mpetent. Insider Losses One way the witch hunters attempt to rally the publ ic is to call attention to the obscene profits of the witch who’s being hunted. It’s assumed that inside information is a license to pri nt money. Unfortunately, the SEC doesn’t compile statistics s howing the number of times that “inside information” didn’t pay off. They have too much to do making pitches for an enlarged staff of prose cutors. Although we’ll never know, I suspect that more mone y has been lost with inside information than gained.

"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 122 THE 10 GOLDEN RULES OF MUTUAL FUND INVESTING Mutual funds are a convenient way to carry out what ever investment strategy you want to employ. But it is as easy to choose the wrong mutual fund as it is to select the wrong stocks or bonds. Here are ten golden rules to help you find your way to funds tha t are right for you. PURPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT Rule #1: Ask yourself what you want from a fund. Are you buying it: • Because you think the investments it holds are goin g to be especially profitable? • Because you think the fund’s manager will be especi ally clever at picking the most profitable stocks or bonds, or at knowing when to be in the market and when to be out? • To hedge against other investments you hold? • To enhance the balance of a diversified portfolio? If you’re not clear about your purpose, you can’t e ven begin to sort through the thousands of mutual funds available. YOU DON’T KNOW WHICH FUND WILL PERFORM BEST Rule #2: Don’t count on being right when you try to pick winners . You have no way of knowing which funds will perform best next year. The success rankings of mutual funds continu ally change. This year’s star may come from last year’s unknown, and last year’s best fund may fall to the back of the pack. My favorite example is Strategic Capital Gains — wh ich was the #1 fund for the final quarter of 1985 from among 973 f unds monitored by"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 123 Lipper Analytical Services. The very next quarter, the fund was 973rd — dead last. 4 Obviously, you don’t want a fund that never has a g ood year — but, in most cases, last year’s performance tells us little about a fund’s future. The word “performance” usually refers to whether a fund has beaten the market and outperformed similar funds. But you do want to check a different kind of performance — whether the fund’s record matches your purposes. For example, suppose you have a diversified portfol io that includes some stock investments. It’s important that the st ock investments do well whenever the stock market rises, so you want t o confirm that a stock fund has gone up substantially whenever the m arket has risen. That’s more important than the fund’s overall recor d in bull markets and bear markets alike. On the other hand, if stocks are always your primar y investment, you need to protect against sharp stock-market declines that could devastate your portfolio. So you’d check to be sur e a fund has held up well during bear markets — even if it hasn’t been a top performer during bull markets. In other words, (1) decide what you need from a fun d, (2) look for one whose policies seem to match your need, and (3) the n see whether the fund’s record confirms that it performs the way you expect it to. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH? Rule #3: Decide whether you want to invest or specu late. When you invest , you protect your capital from depreciation, confiscation, inflation, or anything else that migh t take it from you.   4 Barron’s , May 19, 1986, page 47."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 124 And you accept the rate of return the markets are p roviding to investors generally. When you speculate , you put your capital at risk in an attempt to bea t the market — to get a better return than other inve stors are earning, to outguess the future, to win big by being in the rig ht place at the right time. If you had most of your money in blue-chip stocks i n October 1987, you may have believed you were investing. But by c oncentrating your capital in one place, you were speculating — g uessing that stocks would continue to be the leading investment. And your wrong guess cost you dearly. You’re speculating whenever you bet everything you have on one investment, on your ability to get out when the inv estment peaks, or on your belief that you or your favorite advisor kn ows more than other investors. You’re speculating — even if someone as sures you that you’re being conservative. There’s nothing wrong with speculating — provided y ou do it with money you can afford to lose . If you’re investing, you must choose a fund that he lps your portfolio prosper from whatever may come. If you’re speculat ing, you will look for the fund likely to profit the most if your view of the future turns out to be correct. GETTING RICH Rule #4: Your chances of beating the market are sli m . Investors and advisors talk a great deal about beat ing the market averages, but few people actually accomplish it for long. I’ve been in the investment business for over 25 years, and I’ve met, heard, or read all the leading personalities. But I’ve never come across anyone who"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 125 could reliably outperform the market for any length of time. Of course, everyone has his lucky periods. I know I have. And all of us talk about our winning streaks. But no one ever seems to repeat yesterday’s success. The first principle of investment advice is: The ad visor with a perfect track record up to now will lose his touch the mome nt you start acting on his advice . There’s a good reason for this. You don’t hear of an advisor or fund until it has compiled its fantastic record — only t hen does it come to your attention. But by this time the lucky streak has about run out. The Hulbert Financial Digest monitors the model portfolios of over 100 popular investment newsletters, noting every re commendation, to determine how profitable the advisor’s advice has b een. The newsletter with the best 7-year record through June 30, 1987, had compiled a gain of exactly 600%, which is a compoun d profit of 32% per year — which seems much too good to be just luc k. But anyone acting on this newsletter’s recommendations would h ave lost 57% of his capital four months later, when the stock market crashed. Of course, even after that disastrous month, the ne wsletter still had a 200% profit since 1980. But that was irrelevant to most readers. Hardly anyone had followed the newsletter’s advice continuously since 1980, because hardly anyone knew it existed b efore 1987. Only after the winning record was compiled did investors beco me aware of the newsletter. And by then the lucky streak was o ver. That applies equally to mutual funds. We hear abou t fabulous records. But, of course, all of them are after the fact — and no one can direct us to the next success story. As I said, there’s nothing wrong with speculating — provided you do it with money you can afford to lose. But don’t ri sk the capital that’s"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 126 precious to you on a bet that some fund will outper form the market. 100% INVESTMENT Rule #5: Be sure the fund stays fully invested. It is common for a mutual fund to speculate — alter ing its exposure to the market as the fund manager’s outlook changes. If a stock fund manager is bullish, his fund might have 90-100% of its assets in stocks — but then switch to a large cash position w hen he turns bearish. This is market timing, and it can make a fund usele ss to you. When you buy such a fund, you buy the fund manager’s opi nions about the future of the market — which aren’t likely to be be tter than anyone else’s. The manager’s market timing efforts defeat your pur pose. If the fund is meant to be the stock portion of a diversified p ortfolio, or if you’re speculating that the market is headed upward, your investment strategy will be frustrated if the fund manager tur ns bearish and reduces his stock holdings. Almost always, you’re better off to buy a fund that ’s always fully invested — so that 100% of your purchase goes into the investment (stocks, bonds, or anything else) you’ve chosen. T hat way you regulate your exposure to the market by how much mo ney you put into the fund. "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 127 LOOK FOR VOLATILITY Rule #6: A volatile fund can be safer than a stable fund . Volatility is the degree to which an investment’s p rice fluctuates relative to similar investments. The more volatile a fund is, the further it moves as its underlying market moves. F or example, a very volatile stock fund might change in value by 50% (u p or down) when the stock market itself moves by only 25%. That a volatile fund can be safer seems paradoxical . But, again, keep your eye on what you want to accomplish. As the stock market fluctuates, a volatile fund has a greater impact on your portfolio. Thus you can get the same profit f rom a small position in a volatile fund that you would with a big positi on in a slower- moving fund. This frees up capital for other inves tments — such as Treasury bills or even gold — that can help offset your stock losses if the stock market goes down. A volatile fund lets y ou buy hedges without sacrificing any profit potential. If you think stocks are about to rise and you want to bet on it with your speculative capital, you can limit the amount you put at risk by using a volatile fund. No matter how volatile it i s, you can never lose more than you invest — but if the market goes up, t he volatile fund will make more for you. Published tables that compare mutual funds often in clude a column labeled “Beta.” It measures how volatile a fund is and how reliably it moves in the same direction as a particular market (which, for a stock fund, is usually the S&P 500 index). Basically, the higher the beta, the more the fund s atisfies this golden rule of fund investing. Sometimes a table rates fund volatility by “Standar d Deviation.” This"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 128 is a different measurement — but, again, the higher the number, the more volatile the fund tends to be. 4 DON’T BE PENNY FOOLISH Rule #7: Pay no attention to the makeup of a fund’s expenses, and don’t place too much importance on total expense . Many financial journalists spurn mutual funds with 12-b-1 plans. But why should we care about 12-b-1 plans? If expenses matter at all, it’s total expenses and not the kind of expenses that should concern us. 5 And many advisors tell investors to choose the fund s with the lowest expense ratios. But such advice needs to be qualif ied. It is a fund’s net result that affects our capital. How the fund achieves that result doesn’t matter. If two funds perform roughly the s ame year after year, it shouldn’t matter that one spends liberally on ad vertising and lavishes perqs on its directors, while the other is the essence of frugality. A fund with high expenses should have trouble match ing the return of a competitor with low expenses. So the fund’s expe nse ratio may be a valuable datum in the absence of a long-term track record — especially since a little luck in selecting investm ents could offset high expenses for a year or two. But never forget that results, not thrift, are the criterion. I suggest these guidelines regarding expenses:   4 The Handbook for No-Load Fund Investors , a yearly publication, provides a wealth of information on over 1,500 fund s. You can order it for $49 from the No-Load Fund Investor, P.O. Box 318, Irvington-on- Hudson, N.Y. 10533; 5 A 12-b-1 plan allows a fund to use a specified shar e of its assets each year for advertising and other activities to o btain new shareholders. The expense ratio is the fund’s annu al expenses stated as a percentage of the fund’s average yearly assets . "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 129 1. If a fund has for many years lived up to its inv estment objectives, and it has consistently produced a retu rn as good as most others in its class, don’t worry about its exp ense ratio — even if it’s conspicuously high. 2. If the fund hasn’t lived up to its investment objectives, or if it has consistently underperformed its competitors, don’t bother with the fund — even if its expense ratio is very l ow. 3. If you don’t have enough information to use gui delines #1 and #2, then avoid a stock fund whose expense ratio is over 1.5%, and avoid a bond fund or a money market fund whose expense ratio is over 1.0%. TAXES ARE SECONDARY Rule #8: Keep tax planning in its place . If you let tax considerations dictate an investment decision, you might lose more on the investment than you save in taxes. First determine the best means to satisfy your inve stment purpose. Then decide how to implement those means in a way t hat helps reduce your tax burden. For example, if safety is important, don’t let tax considerations lead you to buy a tax-exempt bond fund — which lacks the safety of investing in Treasury securities. But having decid ed on Treasury securities, invest in whatever way minimizes the ta x bite — such as holding a Treasury-security fund inside an IRA (Ind ividual Retirement Account). Also be aware that funds with similar investment st rategies can be quite different in the taxes they generate. Which brings us to the next"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 130 rule . . . LOOK FOR SMALL DIVIDENDS Rule #9: Choose funds that pay the smallest dividen ds. Of the funds that serve your investment purpose, fo cus on those that pay the tiniest dividends. I realize this is oppos ite to the advice you usually hear, but it makes much more sense. A mutual fund dividend accomplishes only one thing — to run up your tax bill. The dividend (or capital gain distr ibution) simply takes money from your left pocket and puts it into your r ight pocket — with the tax-collector taking part of the transfer. The dividend adds nothing to the value of your inve stment, because the money the fund gives you has been taken from th e net asset value of your shares — causing the net asset value to dro p by the amount of the dividend. Before the dividend, whatever the fu nd had earned caused the share price to rise, and you could withd raw those earnings at any time just by redeeming (selling) all or some of your shares. If the fund paid no dividends, you could choose whe n to be taxed simply by choosing when to sell. Your investment c ould accumulate and compound for years, if you liked, with no taxes to slow the compounding. But by declaring a dividend, the fund takes the cho ice away from you. The dividend is taxable income this year — even if you reinvest the dividend in additional shares. Why then do funds pay dividends? Because if they d on’t distribute their investment gains, they have to pay taxes them selves — which would greatly complicate its relationship with its shareholders. So all funds pay some dividends. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 131 However, the tax laws provide ways for a fund to mi nimize the damage. Unfortunately, many funds disregard those opportunities and pay out more than they need to as taxable dividends , because so many investors have been taught that big dividends are a plus. But some other funds work hard to keep their dividends small . So funds with similar investment objectives and similar performan ce records may differ considerably in the taxable dividends they p ay. Most tables of mutual funds in The Wall Street Jour nal , Barron’s , or other publications show dividend yields. It’s easy enough to find the funds that minimize dividends. Always choose funds first on the basis of how well their investment objectives and performance match your needs. Among the funds that qualify, buy those that minimize your tax bill by l imiting dividends. DON’T JUMP BLINDLY Rule #10: Never do anything you don’t understand . The only way you’re likely to suffer a disastrous l oss is with an investment you don’t fully understand. It isn’t sufficient that your favorite advisor, you r best friend, or your brother-in-law understands something. It isn’t his money that will be lost. Even if he does risk his capital alongside yours, h e may be better suited to take this particular risk — by virtue of his emotional makeup, his financial condition, or his other inves tments. It’s better to leave your money in Treasury bills than to expos e yourself to risks you don’t comprehend. Invest in things you understand. Then expand your knowledge — if you want to — to open up more possibilities. But d on’t be in a hurry. Take your time, and take each step deliberately."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 132 SUMMARY From these 10 Golden Rules, we can summarize the pr ocedure for selecting mutual funds: 1. Define the investment purpose to be served by th e funds you buy. 2. Find the funds whose investment policies match y our purpose. 3. Of these funds, narrow the field to those that w hose records live up to their policies. 4. Eliminate those funds that don’t stay 100% inves ted. 5. Of the funds remaining, select those that pay th e smallest dividends. THE PERMANENT PORTFOLIO FAMILY Terry Coxon created the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds in 1982 to enable you to employ these Golden Rules effectiv ely. There are now four funds in the family — each desig ned to carry out a specific purpose. Each remains fully invested at a ll times, so a fund manager’s opinions about market trends can’t thwart your objective. And each fund is alert to opportunities to reduce y our tax bill. None of them can avoid paying dividends entirely. But norm ally each pays a dividend that’s only a fraction of what funds with similar investment policies pay. Here are the four funds . . . The Aggressive Growth Portfolio "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 133 This fund is fully invested in stocks that tend to outperform a rising market. It is designed to be volatile, and can mov e dramatically, in either direction. The Aggressive Growth Portfolio is ideal for the st ock-market portion of a diversified portfolio, or for a speculation in stocks when you expect the market to rise. The Treasury Bill Portfolio This is a money market fund that invests only in sh ort-term Treasury securities — the safest possible investment in term s of credit risk. However, rather than keep its share price fixed at $1 by paying daily dividends, the fund holds on to its earnings and le ts the share price rise. It pays only one dividend a year — a dividen d no larger than needed for the fund itself to avoid income tax. This means a good part of your return escapes taxat ion until you decide to withdraw the money by redeeming shares. Even then your tax bill may be very low — since you pay tax only o n the profit portion of the particular shares you redeem. The r est of your withdrawal is a return of capital. If you eventually redeem all your shares, you’ll pa y tax on all your earnings. But deferring the tax until then can put you way ahead — because, until then, the money not paid in taxes is compounding inside your account. The Treasury Bill Portfolio is ideal for the dollar portion of a long- term investment portfolio, as well as a safe place to park your capital while you wait for an attractive speculation. The Versatile Bond Portfolio This fund is similar to the Treasury Bill Portfolio except for the investments it holds. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 134 Instead of U.S. Treasury bills, it invests in short -term corporate bonds. The high quality of the bonds (rated A or higher by Standard & Poor’s) limits the credit risk. And the short time to maturity of the bonds (always 2 years or less) limits the effect of changes in market interest rates on the share price. Thus, without t aking big risks, the fund can earn a higher return than with Treasury bi lls. The Versatile Bond Portfolio is suitable for the ca sh portion of a long- term investment portfolio, and it’s a good place to keep capital while waiting for speculative market opportunities. The Permanent Portfolio This unusual fund was designed to protect you no ma tter what happens to the economy — prosperity, inflation, def lation, or recession. It holds fixed, unchanging percentages of its assets in: • aggressive growth stocks (15%), • shares of real estate and natural resource stocks ( 15%), • high-grade dollar assets, such as U.S. Treasury sec urities (35%), • gold (20%), • silver (5%), and • Swiss francs (10%). Because bull markets in most investments affect the ir performance more than bear markets do, at any given time the Po rtfolio’s rising investments can outweigh those that are falling — a nd so the Portfolio can rise even when stocks or gold is in a bear mark et. The Permanent Portfolio Fund is ideal as a long-ter m investment — to keep a safety net under your investment strategy, w hatever that may be. No matter what happens, you’ll know that a por tion of your assets are completely safe.

STRATEGY March 9, 1980 It is natural for investors to assume that success depends upon the ability to predict the future. The investor tries to foresee what will happen next year, and bets on his forecast through the investment markets. His pr ofits, he believes, will depend upon the accuracy of his forecast. Usually, however, he finds that events don’t occur in the way he had foreseen. And so he looks for an investment advisor to help him. He reads the advertisements in Barron’s (or some other journal) – learning of the advisor who correctly foresaw the r ise in a particular investment or an advisor who claims to consistently issue timely buy and sell signals. The investor chooses the most promising advisor and rubs his hands in anticipation of the big profits that finally wil l be his. Unfortunately, however, he falls prey to a natural law of the inve stment world: The advisor with a perfect record will turn sour as soon as you start using his advice. Interestingly, the advisor will probably continue t o advertise his excellent results. And if you check the advertised results against the forecasts he gave, you’ll probably have to admit th at his advertisements are correct – in fact, if not in spi rit. There are several possible reasons for this. One is that the advisor may have offered many different (and possibly contradic tory) forecasts over the past year. Another possibility is that he offered several investment alternatives for taking advantage of a c orrect forecast, and you happened to select the weakest alternative. Or his triumphant predictions may have been accompanied by a legion o f qualifications"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 137 that made the predictions meaningless. Or the tradi ng advice may have consistently reached you too late to be profit able. One way or another, it turns out that the highly pu blicized predictive powers of the advisor have been of no value to you. Even the occasional lucky guess – forecasting the range of n ext year’s gold prices, for example – doesn’t usually translate aut omatically into investment profits, because it doesn’t necessarily tell you just when to buy or sell. An investment advisor’s job isn’t to predict the fu ture. His only future-seeing role is to call your attention to pos sible events that other people seem to be ignoring. Or to point out why an event that most people are expecting has little chance of coming to pass. But this is quite different from predicting the future. To be useful, predictions would have to spell out s pecific dates, so as to facilitate the timing of investment purchases an d sales. And the predictions would have to be consistently accurate, because you would be betting on the wrong predictions as well a s the right ones. Such predictive powers are literally beyond the abi lities of any human being – and will be seen to be so whenever the full context of past predictions is examined. We live in a world in whic h any single event is the consequence of millions of causes. And it is beyond the power of any individual to be aware of all the causes – o r to have a understanding of all the natural laws that determin e what the causes will lead to. And if a large organization is employ ed to try to gather all the relevant facts, the selection and interpret ation of those facts will be confused by a mixture of personal opinions. So when the investor finally abandons the hope of k nowing the future, he unloads a lot of excess baggage. And he may be r eady to begin the serious task of learning how to deal with his inves tments. "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 138 But how can he make investments without knowing wha t will happen to them? He has to rely upon a proper strategy – a strategy that can produce profits in an uncertain world. And until he abandon s the hope of finding an inside track to the future, he’ll never do the thinking necessary to develop the strategy. This article will attempt to provide the principles of such a strategy. It is, in effect, a summary of the philosophy that has been evolving in the newsletter over the past five years, and that u nderlies the investment suggestions I make. UNCERTAINTY Naturally, it begins with the recognition that we l ive in an uncertain world – a world so large and so complicated that yo u could never hope to understand completely even the things that are most important to you. Nor could you hope to anticipate every even t that will have a bearing upon you life. To expect to do so is to car ry the demoralizing responsibility for an unrealistic goal. EXPECTATIONS But, while you can’t predict the future, you necess arily have expectations. All human action is based upon belief s and expectations. You have beliefs concerning the conditions that wil l bring happiness, and beliefs concerning the way you must act in orde r to bring about those conditions. And you have expectations concern ing the way others will act and react. Your expectations concerning the world at large mig ht be very general – such as assuming that price inflation won’t end t his year or that the Russians won’t withdraw from Eastern Europe or that Richard Nixon won’t be reelected president in 1980. And you may h ave more"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 139 specific expectations regarding the directions of t he economy, the securities, markets, specific industries, and even specific investment prices. The first step in investment strategy is to recogni ze your expectations. The second step is to disregard the expectations th at you hold in common with many people. The expectations that matc h those of the majority should remain in the back of your mind, bu t they aren’t important for investment purposes. Only the expectations that differ from the majority view can make money for you. Not because the majority is always w rong (it isn’t), but because you can’t make money betting on the fav orites. OFF TO THE RACES This would be easier to see if we were betting on h orses. Suppose that you study the racing form for the eighth race at Sa nta Anita. You decide that Spectacular Bid should win the race, yo u discuss the matter with other bettors, and you find that almost everyone agrees with you. If that’s the case, you’ll have to risk $2 in the h ope of winning only about 20 cents. And, in an uncertain world, there i s no guarantee of success; your horse could break a leg, another hors e might have been kept under wraps until now, or it might start raini ng as the horses leave the post. With such uncertainty, why risk $2 to make only 20 cents? Suppose, instead, that your studies produce a possi ble winner that almost everyone ignores. In that case, other bettor s (through the pari- mutuel machines) will offer much better odds – 10 t o 1 or 20 to 1 or more. A $2 risk has the chance of producing a profi t of $40 or more. The bet makes more sense. "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 140 Given the natural state of uncertainty, it makes no sense to risk a large amount against the hope of a small profit. Even if you’re right a majority of the time, a single loss would wipe out a series of gains. INVESTMENT ODDS In the investment world, there is no tote board tha t lists the loss- reward odds – but the odds exist, nonetheless. They are just stated in a different way. For example, suppose the price of gold is $700 per ounce today. It means, basically, that the consensus judgment of th e potential and actual participants in the gold market (the other b ettors) is that the price of gold will be around $800 a year from today . Today’s gold price results from two basic factors: (1) immediate needs – such as the need of a gold fabricator for t he metal or the need of a gold miner or gold investor for cash; and (2) expectations concerning future gold prices. If the anticipated f uture price is enough above the current price to produce a bigger profit than can be earned in a no-risk investment (such as Treasury bills), m any professional investors will purchase the gold and take the risk. So a $700 gold price today means that the average opinion of the m arket’s participants is that the price will be about $800 n ext year. If the anticipated price were higher than $800, more peopl e would buy and push today’s price higher; if the anticipated price were lower than $800, too many people would sell, pushing today’s p rice lower, because the anticipated return would be too small. If you expect a price of $1,000 a year from now, an d you feel you can limit a loss to $100 per ounce, it means the market is offering you odds of 3 to 1. If you’re right, you’ll make $300; if you’re wrong, you’ll lose $100 – odds of 3 to 1. Or an expectatio n of a $1,500 price would create odds of 8 to 1 (an $800 gain vs. a $10 0 loss). "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 141 On the other hand, if you expect an $800 price next year (as the majority apparently does), you are getting odds of only 1 to 1 (hoping for a gain of $100 against a risk of $100 per ounce ). By weighing the potential reward against the possib le loss, you find the odds that are being offered to you. And it’s ne cessary to do this – in order to identify the loss-reward ratio. A mere expectation that the price will go higher is not sufficient reason for m aking an investment. Suppose, for example, that you could find no reason able way to limit the loss to less that $300 per ounce. In that case , an expectation of a $1,000 price next year would still leave you with o dds of 1 to 1 ($300 vs. $300) – considerably different from the 3-to-1 odds you would have if the loss could be limited to $100. Since you can’t predict the future, your expectatio n concerning next year’s prices is only a guess – a guess that you ne ed to make in order to decide whether the investment is worth the risk. The future isn’t assured. But an expected price sho uld be more than just a vague possibility (of which there are billio ns in this world); you should believe there is a good chance of its coming about. The difference between the “good chance” bettor and the man who “knows” the future is that the former always knows that he may be wrong. And so he pays attention to the loss possibi lity that’s involved, and he finds a way of limit it. Further along, I’ll discuss my method of identifyin g and limiting the loss. First, however, we should establish a standar d for determining whether the odds offered for a given investment are attractive enough to warrant making a bet. THE RIGHT ODDS "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 142 It makes sense to me to invest in something only if the odds offered are 10 to 1 or better. I want the potential reward to be at least 10 times the amount I might lose. At first glance, this may seem excessively ambitiou s – or that only the riskiest kinds of investments would qualify. But th e loss-reward ratio has nothing to do with the inherent riskiness of th e investment – if by riskiness we mean the possibility that all one’s ca pital might be lost. When I suggested buying silver at $5.28 in March 19 78, the loss was limited to 8% through a stop-loss at $4.88 – while we were hopeful that the price would rise by 100% or more – odds of 12 to 1. On the other hand, if you lend money to your flaky brother -in-law at 20% interest, you’re taking the chance of losing 100% o f the capital – odds of 1 to 5 (not 5 to 1). The riskier investment can have the worst odds. As to the possibility that my standard is unduly am bitious, there are four reasons that I think it is reasonable: 1. The alternative : Suppose you decide you’re tired of spending money on newsletters that only make you feel guilty as they pile up, unread, in the corner – and that you’re tired o f traveling to investment seminars where you tend to fall asleep d uring the speeches. Suppose you decide that you’re tired of a rguing with your spouse over where your money should be investe d – or tired of getting into emotional discussions at cocktail p arties over whether gold or stocks are proper investments. In short, suppose you decide that you’re tired of a ll the time, trouble, and cost involved in trying to handle your investme nts. And since hiring an advisor requires the same effort in order to choose wisely, what alternative is left? What would you do with yo ur money? One simple and safe alternative would be to leave t he money in 90- day Treasury bills – instructing the bank or broker to buy new bills as"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 143 they expire. For at least the foreseeable future, t he chances of losing the capital are very remote. If you do this, you’ll receive interest that’s abou t 1% or 2% under whatever is the price inflation rate at any time. T he inflation rate will fluctuate, but so will the interest rate on the T-b ills – since you will get new ones every 90 days. That might seem to be a losing proposition, but it really isn’t. It would mean that you’re paying 1% to 2% per year in purcha sing power to protect your wealth from sudden loss and to accompl ish that without any personal effort. Few people begrudge the insura nce premiums that are paid and never recovered, so why begrudge the s mall cost of this easy safety? Because the 2% is subtracted yearly from a decreasi ng balance (in purchasing power), it is a form of reverse compound ing. So it would take 34 years (not 25) before your purchasing power would be cut in half – and 54 years before it would be cut to a thi rd. Taxes would affect these results, of course, but th ey affect all other investments as well. And it might be possible to sh elter the investment so that you pay taxes only as you withdraw cash fro m the T-bill portfolio. By exercising no investment judgment other than buy ing T-bills, you can achieve a risk-free return of about 12% for 198 0. Therefore, there is no point in bothering with any investment unless there’s a chance"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 144 to improve upon that. 1 2. The losses : If you do make investment choices, you’re bound t o have losses along the way. I have made many mistakes throughout my life. Only ignorance or arrogance could cause me to think that I made my ve ry last mistake an hour ago. There are more to come. I think that life is simply a process of “growing u p,” that I will always be learning and improving, and that I will always l ook back on the previous year with embarrassment as some of the foo lish things I did and expected. That means that some of today’s expectations and ta ctics will also turn out to have been misguided. I will make mistak es; I will suffer losses. Thus, the winning investments must produce profits that are large enough to compensate for the losses that will inevi tably occur. 3. The effort : Since investing is not effortless (while holding T-bills is), the profits must be great enough to cover my l osses, then equal the T-bill return, and then produce enough more to justify the effort. 4. The variables : Lastly, the expected price is only an educated guess. Even if I am generally correct in this case, I don’t really know how much profit I’ll make. I don’t know the pr ecise price at which I’ll sell; I don’t know what mistakes I might make in buying, selling, or holding the investment; nor do I know if the   1 If you were to really consider doing something this simple, there might be other portfolios that would be more approp riate. But the Treasury bill is the classic example of the investm ent that contains no risk of dollar loss, and thus its return is the standard that any other investment must exceed in order to justify it s risk."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 145 eventual sale will be hindered by surprises such as wide price fluctuations, unusually large spreads between buyin g and selling prices, restrictions imposed by the government or t he market, etc.). Thus, I need the potential of a big profit so that, whatever happens, I’ll still have a worthwhile gain (enough to satisfy the first three reasons I’ve given) after the potential has been eroded. If the potential profit is 100% or better and my ge neral expectation is correct, I can suffer a few surprises and still com e out with a healthy return. But if I start with a hope of only 25%, I h ave no margin for error. ABSOLUTE RETURN A second standard is also necessary. The investment should have odds of 10 to 1 or better, so that the gains will more t han cover the inevitable losses. But the investment should also h ave a potential profit of 50% per year or better – regardless of th e potential loss. For example, a one-year investment that combined a profit potential of 10% with a loss potential of only ½% of the pric e would have odds of 20 to 1. But the 10% return would be less than t he current Treasury-bill return. Even with the low loss potent ial, what would be the point of making the investment? The potential p rofit should be considerably better than the T-bill return in order to tolerate surprises and still justify the effort. If the odds are good but the absolute-return potent ial is low, the investment can be brought up to the standard by usi ng margin. In the example given, the investment could be bought on 10 % margin (leverage of 10 to 1) – thereby increasing the loss potential to 5% and increasing the profit potential to 100%. So I set two standards for a prospective investment : 1) the potential gain should be at least 10 times the potential loss ; and (2) the profit"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 146 potential should be at least 50% for each year I be lieve it will take to earn the profit. 2 LOSS LIMITATION I suspect that the failure to develop an effective method of limiting losses is the single largest contributor to poor in vestment results. Some people ignore the downside risk entirely. I ha ve often heard an investor say that he “thinks positively” about an i nvestment. And if he things the price is going upward, why muddy one’s c onfidence by dwelling on the downside potential? Obviously, that attitude is wrong. And it’s amazing that no accumulation of losses will stop the investor from “thinking positively.” But it isn’t much better simply to acknowledge the downside possibility and promise to “sell if the price drops .” The word “drops” is meaningless in this context. The price might dro p by 0.0003% two minutes after you buy; would that mean you should s ell? How far must the price drop to warrant getting out? It’s obvious that you must know – before you buy the investment – exactly how far you’ll let the price drop before se lling.   2 If the time span of the investment exceeds one year , the 50%-per-year standard should be compounded, not simple multiplie d by the number of years anticipated, in order to equal the potential of separate one- year investments. That is, a project two-year inves tment should have a potential profit of 125% (not 100%) – increasing th e capital from 100% to 150% the first year, and from 150% to 225% (a ga in of 50% on the 150%) the second year. Similarly, a projected three -year investment should have a potential profit of 238% (not 150%), and 400% (not 200%) for a four-year investment. In a long-term investme nt, it need not be assumed that the price will increase by 50% every y ear, only that the overall result will be equivalent to that. "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 147 This decision must be made before the investment is purchased, because your emotional state will change as soon as you make the purchase. When you don’t own an investment, you can look at the matter objectively. But once you’ve bought it, you have an emotional interest in its success – and that can inspire you to hang on in the hope of an imminent recovery. The reluctance to take a loss is one of the most si gnificant barriers to investment success. And so it is foolish to believe that you can make decisions as effectively while you own the investme nt as you could before you bought. Stop-Loss Orders When you’ve decided how much you’re willing to lose , you should enforce the decision by issuing a stop-loss order at the same time you issue the instruction to buy the investment. Without a stop-loss (an instruction to the bank or broker to sell the investment automatically if the price drops to a sp ecified level), you are prey to the emotional turmoil that leads to so many losses. During a falling market, you must reopen the question dail y – the question of whether to sell or to hold on a little longer. And no matter how great the loss at any given point , the answer 99% of the time will be to hold on. It will almost alwa ys seem to make more sense to wait before selling. After all, the p rice might rise tomorrow – and another day’s price drop will not, o f itself , be fatal. No one day ever seems to be critical. And so the se parate, non-critical days add- up – along with the losses. Consequently, you are likely to take the initiative to sell only when frightened into doing so by the very conditions tha t usually accompany the end of a downtrend – large daily pric e drops, panic news, or widespread margin calls. And so you can wi nd up selling at"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 148 the very bottom, simply because you hadn’t given au thority (through a stop-loss) to your earlier decision to sell at a hi gher price. Options A second way to limit losses is by using options. I f you purchase an option, the price of the option itself constitutes the maximum loss, since you aren’t liable for anything but the option ’s cost. And you can’t usually limit the loss to anything less than that; option prices fluctuate too broadly to permit a stop-loss. Other Situations There are situations where neither stop-losses or o ptions are possible. These include illiquid investments such as real est ate, collectibles, and business enterprises. In such cases, it is difficul t to know even the value of the investments at any given time. To compensate partly for this, I think it’s valuabl e to identify (at the time you make the investment) the conditions that m ight occur that should prompt you to sell the investment. Make a li st of the various economic conditions that would confirm the idea tha t the investment is now a mistake to hold. These might include falli ng prices of related investments, changes in certain national economic i ndicators, changes in the economic climate that surrounds the investme nt, etc. Review the list periodically to see if the investment stil l makes sense. Of course, this is a far cry from having a stop-los s – but it is much better than failing to define the rationale behind the investment. The lack of such mechanisms as stop-losses and options is one reason that I am very cautious about illiquid investments – and that I believe they should be limited to only 15% to 20% of your total wealth. However, you might decide to purchase an illiquid i nvestment on the basis that you’re willing to lose the entire amount . As long as you’re really prepared to lose it all, it’s obvious that y ou’ve decided to get"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 149 out of the investment, if it does poorly, only when its value falls to zero. So no further consideration of when to bail o ut is necessary. Permanent Portfolio Permanent Portfolio (long-term) holdings are usuall y exempt from the stop-loss rule. For one thing, there are usually ti me limits on stop-loss instructions. For another, long-term holdings are, by definition, not selected because of current market trends. Here again, however, I think it’s valuable to ident ify and write down the reasons behind each investment – and to specify the conditions that would confirm that the investment is no longer a good choice. PROFITS As I said earlier, small profits won’t serve to cov er your losses nor will they justify the effort involved in investing. But, again, a mere admonition to “let your profits run” has no more su bstance than a promise to “sell if the price drops.” In each case, one must have a systematic way of identifying precisely the conditi ons for selling. The original analysis of the investment provides a rough price objective. But this isn’t really a forecast of wher e the price will peak. It is only an assessment of a price you believe is reasonably possible, given your analysis of current conditions. Its purp ose is to determine the general magnitude of the profit potential – so that you can decide if the loss-reward ratio meets your standards. To decide in advance that you’ll sell when the pric e rises to that objective could cause two problems. The first is th at the price may get close to that objective, but never quite reach it. If the price then falls all the way back to the original stop-loss level, t he earlier price advance will have netted you nothing. "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 150 The second drawback to setting a selling point in a dvance is that the price may go way beyond it. Since the investment st rategy maintains that a few very large profits are necessary to just ify the effort of investing, taking profits at prices too low can def eat the purpose. In 1978, with silver at $5 and gold at $170, who would have set 2-year price objectives of even $20 for silver or $500 for gold – let alone the peaks that they’ve reached so far? There’s an old saying that “no one ever lost money taking a profit” – meaning, roughly, that selling too soon and taking a profit is better than selling too late and taking a loss. This may b e true if you consider only the transaction at hand. But if you c onsider a series of transactions, people do lose money by taking small profits – because their profits are never big enough to offset the lo sses that inevitably occur. The final result is a net loss overall – and the overall results are what count, not the result for any one transaction. So, when you catch that sought-after long uptrend, you don’t want to be bound to a specific price objective that could c ause you to sell much too early. And you don’t want to be bound to a specific price objective that could cause you to wait too long if the uptrend turns out to be short-lived. There are a number of technical tools available for identifying the tops of uptrends as they occur, but I have never found a ny of them to be reliable (and I have spent a good deal of time inve stigating them). As examples, the gold and silver markets have defied a lmost all the tried- and-true technical indicators during the past few m onths. Stop-Losses Again The answer, of course, is to find the best way poss ible to let the market tell you when the uptrend is over. You can d o this by raising the stop-loss as the price increases – finally sell ing whenever the price has dropped far enough to trigger the current stop- loss. You won’t sell at the very top this way, but no one you know will do so either."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 151 When choosing a stop-loss, the object is to pick th e level that will cause a sale if there is confirmation that the tren d has ended, but will keep you in the market as long as the uptrend is st ill alive. Thus, we can define an efficient stop-loss price as: the highest price tha t would indicate that the investment is not now in an uptre nd . At the time of the purchase, the efficient stop-loss is the price that indicates that the purchase was a mistake; later (after a price rise), it is the price that indicates that there’s no more profit to be had fro m the investment in the near future. In all cases, you want the highest price that gives these signals. Finding the efficient stop-loss level is no easy ta sk. It isn’t enough to decide how much you’re willing to lose and place th e stop-loss accordingly. This could cause you to lose more than necessary or to sell out just before the price finally moves upward . However, in the absence of any other basis for choosing, it would s till be wise to place a stop-loss a little above the price level that rep resents the maximum you can afford to lose. The basis of my system for picking stop-loss levels was explained in New Profits from the Monetary Crisis in chapters 8, 9, and 29. I have augmented those ideas in the article, “Finding & Us ing the Efficient Stop-Loss,” which immediately follows this article. Bear in mind that no system of picking stop-loss le vels will ever be perfect. Sometimes, the uptrend will resume immedia tely after the stop-loss has been activated. The object is to crea te stop-loss levels that correctly confirm trend changes most of the time – but you won’t be right every time. Nevertheless, you’re still much better off than if there were no stop- losses at all. The stop-loss is simply a concrete m anifestation of your estimate of what constitutes a change in trend. You would be subject to the same mistakes in estimates if you didn’t use stop-losses – but you would be without the protection stop-losses pro vide."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 152 OPTIONS Purchasing an option and letting it sit is an exact counterpart of setting an original stop-loss but never raising it. If the price rises substantially but then falls back to where it started (all within the time period of the option), you will not have profited from the price rise. If the price is higher at the time the option expir es, profits will be locked in by selling the option and replacing it wi th a new one. The new option will necessarily have a higher striking price – and, thus, will have less value than the option you’re selling . Thus, the new option will cost less than what you receive for the old option; the difference represents profit that can be banked - never to be given back to this market. In the absence of a better sys tem, one can decide merely to continue rolling over the options in this way until such time as an option expires with no value – and consider t hat to be the end of the investment. However, there might be a strong price rise followe d by a fall - within the life of one option. To wait for the expiration date before acting can mean losing a good deal of the potential profit. To remedy this, you can sell the option prematurely (before expiration) if the price goes up by a significant a mount – replacing the option with a new one that has a higher striking pr ice and a lower cost. Again, you lock in interim profits as they oc cur – before they slip away from you. Whenever you replace an old option with a new one, you pay a cost for the privileges that an option provides – and pa rt of that cost is nonrecoverable. Thus, it can be too expensive to re place the options too frequently. As a result, you should decide at the outset how much profit should accrue in the option before rolling i t over. "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 153 And if a given option expires with no value, you ca n take that as a signal that the investment is over. EARLY SALES These procedures, with stop-losses or options, are designed to implement the adage, “Let your profits run,” withou t forcing you to pick a selling price in advance – and without the a gony of reopening daily the question, “Should I sell?” You can relax and let the sale occur automatically when the time arrives. However, there are times when it makes sense to mak e a deliberate decision to sell “at the market” (the current price ), even though a stop- loss hasn’t been triggered. This is partly because of an easily overlooked, but important, principle: The price at which you bought is no longer a consideration in deciding whether to se ll. I’ve mentioned often that you shouldn’t wait for th e price to return to your buying price before liquidating an investment that has gone wrong. In the same way, if you’re in a profit posit ion, you shouldn’t let the buying price influence current consideratio ns. In either case, it helps to look at an investment you already own in t he same way that you would look at a prospective new investment. In deciding what to do with a winner, you should lo ok only at the present price of the investment – not at the price you paid. The investment’s present value is part of your current net worth; any erosion of the investment’s value (through a price drop) is an erosion of your net worth. The erosion won’t be eliminated by saying that you’ll still wind up with a good profit on this inv estment. For example, suppose you bought an investment at a price of $100, and the price has risen to $200. You could take the attitude that a drop to $150 wouldn’t hurt you, because you would still have a 50% profit. "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 154 But a drop to $150 will mean a loss of 25% from its present value. And you probably wouldn’t enter a new investment if the loss potential were 25%. An existing paper profit should n’t cause you to relax your loss-limitation standards. Neither shoul d an existing profit allow you to lower your standard in evaluating the potential reward that remains in the investment. Suppose that you see the potential peak to be $250. This represents a reward of only 25% from the current price. If, for some reason, the efficient stop-loss level must be $150 (a drop of 2 5% from $200), the market is offering you very poor odds (1 to 1) for holding the investment further. You could say, “If the price goes to $250, I’ll hav e made 150%, and the worst that can happen is that I sell at $150 fo r a 50% profit, so why not try for the $250?” But the profit potential from the $100 buying price no longer applies, because that prices is no longer available to you. The present price is $200 – and o nly the potential loss and reward from that level are important now. Given these principles, I can think of three types of situations in which it might be better to sell outright, rather t han waiting for a stop- loss to be triggered. VOLATILE MARKET The first situation is the extremely volatile marke t. If the price is subject to large changes within one day – say, 10% or more – the risks in holding the investment are especially great. The price could drop so far between one day’s closing and the next day’s op ening that a stop- loss sale would occur at a price far below the stop -loss instruction. Realistically, you would have to consider the poten tial loss (from the current price) to be greater than just what the sto p-loss level suggests. Recognizing this, you might decide to sell outright – rather than risk having the stop-loss prove to be ineffective. Anoth er alternative,"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 155 however, is to sell a part of the investment – one- half, perhaps – and let the stop-loss cover the remainder. Low Efficient Stop-Loss The second situation occurs when the efficient stop -loss level is not close enough to the present price to be useful. A r apid increase without the normal periodic retreats can cause this problem, and it usually means that the price is capable of a long d rop without ending the uptrend. If the efficient stop-loss level is 20 % to 40% below the current price, you’re in trouble. To allow the pric e to drop that far is to allow too much erosion from the present value of yo ur portfolio; but to place a higher stop-loss is to risk being sold o ut before the uptrend is really over. Again, the answer may be to place a stop-loss on ha lf your holdings at the efficient stop-loss level, with a stop-loss on the other half somewhere between that level and the current price. Another alternative is to sell all your holdings, w ith the intention to rebuy if and when the price rises or falls to a lev el where the efficient stop-loss is more useful. Both of these abnormal situations are more likely t o occur toward the end of a trend; earlier phases are usually more ord erly. So a deteriorating loss-reward ratio may induce you to s ell all or most of your holdings. If the price should then go higher, the fact that you already had a good profit might make the sale emoti onally easier to tolerate. The gold market was in both these “possible sell” s ituations recently. The price was very volatile – moving as much as 15% in one day. And the run from $600 to $850 was pretty close to a straight line, leaving the efficient stop-loss level at $565, or 3 4% below the top. I chose the alternative of a stop-loss on half the go ld at $675 (around"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 156 halfway down) with the rest covered by a stop-loss at $565. Given the same circumstances, I’m not sure I’d handle it the same way again. Alternative Investment The third possible sell situation occurs when anoth er investment is more attractive. Suppose that you bought an investm ent at $100, with a potential peak of $300. When the price has risen to $200, the efficient stop-loss happens to be at $175 – limitin g the downside potential from the current price to 12 ½%. But supp ose that you see another investment, also priced now at $200, with t he potential to rise to $400 – a potential gain of 100%. You might say that the earlier investment is superi or because it had a potential for 200% profit – half of which you’ve al ready earned. There would be a natural bias for holding the present inv estment, rather than switching. But, again, all that matters is where you are now – not where you started. Imagine that you don’t hold either investm ent; which one would you buy? They each cost $200, but one has a p otential of $300 and the other $400. If the potential loss is somewh at the same, the answer is obvious. It’s obvious partly because both are priced at $200 in the example. In practice, they’ll have different prices, and so the potentials must be translated into percentages. But the principles the same: look at the present investment in terms of its current price, n ot the price you paid for it. From this point onward, which investment of fers the better prospect? In any comparison of two investments, you may decid e to choose the one with a smaller potential if the probability of its realization seems greater. And this can often be the investment you a lready own and which is rising. This is because the present invest ment has already established an uptrend – while the other investment , although it may"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 157 have great potential, might not yet have proved tha t its uptrend is for real. The time to switch may come later, after the second investment has proven that its time has come. Each of these three situations (an overly volatile market, difficulty in finding an efficient stop-loss level, or a more att ractive alternative investment) can be a reason for selling all or part of an investment before a stop-loss is triggered. But I wouldn’t sel l an investment just because I thought it might be near its peak. As wit h any other forecast, this kind of fortune-telling is as likely to be wro ng as it is to be right. I’d wait for the stop-loss to be activated. OTHER MARKETS At any time, there always will be a number of stock s, commodities, and other investments that are moving upward. This can cause you to feel that you aren’t getting in on all the action. In fact, some of these other investments are bound to be showing bigger pr ofits than the ones you hold. It can be difficult to keep your per spective. Realize that you can’t stay on top of every conceiv able investment; to even try to do so would be a big mistake. No one pe rson has the time to follow the fundamentals and technical indicators on every market. And if you delegate part of the job to others, you’ ll often receive analyses that aren’t consistent with your view of t he world. Therefore, the investments outside your sphere of i nterest are not missed opportunities; for you, they never were oppo rtunities. They are outside of your world. Don’t kick yourself for not having recognized them. It’s best to try to concentrate on a few groups of investments – areas that you find interesting and relatively easy to un derstand. If these groups are not too similar, there almost always sho uld be a recognizable opportunity in at least one of them. "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 158 If you try to follow too many groups, you may fail to recognize any good opportunities – because your interest will be spread too thin. Even if someone has recommended an investment just prior to its big move upward, don’t kick yourself for not having bou ght it. You heard at least ten other recommendations at the same time – recommendations that wouldn’t have paid off. How wo uld you have known which was the right one? Realize that there are risks that you’re not prepar ed to take – risks that other people ignore. In many cases, as it turns out , the risk didn’t materialize into a loss. But the risk existed, neve rtheless, and you were wise to recognize it and to be cautious. You c an’t analyze an investment and its risks in retrospect; you have to look at the considerations that were present at the time you ha d to make the decision. If others take risks that are too much for you, don ’t be shaken by the profits they may achieve. Perhaps the risks will be come relevant tomorrow and destroy the types of investments that currently seem profitable. As the old Greek proverb puts it, “The hare may break his leg on the last lap, causing the tortoise to be gla d that he didn’t grow long ears” – or something like that. Be willing to investigate the methods and markets o f people who seem to be doing better than you are, but don’t fee l compelled to jump on any bandwagon. ADVICE Remember, too, that the recommendations of professi onal advisors reflect their own biases, their own emotions, and t heir own ambitions – which are not the same as yours. Don’t be stamped ed into joining any trend. No advisor is going to assume the respon sibility for your emotional state, your goals, your fears, or your lo sses."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 159 Even if his viewpoint seems to be roughly the same as yours, don’t be panicked by urgent calls to action. If you have set aside a core of your wealth in a way that you think is safe, you’re not compelled to react to a prediction of an imminent event. Most alarms prov e to have been unnecessary. Changes in your approach, your methods , and your safekeeping procedures should be made only with due deliberation. TAKING THINGS FOR GRANTED Lastly, don’t take anything for grated. Don’t assum e that the paper profits you have now are the final result and can b e committed to something else before they’re realized. Don’t assum e that the markets will be open tomorrow, that the rules will remain t he same forever, that the government will allow you to profit when y our expectations come to pass, that a paper IOU you hold (from anyon e) will be paid off. Don’t assume anything. If you don’t take anything for granted, you’ll want to be as diversified as is practical within the range of your expectatio ns. If you hold gold, for example, you might have some gold coins in your own possession and some gold bullion in Switzerland. You’ll look f or ways of neutralizing the risk in any long-term investment t hrough diversification. You’ll be careful never to rely so lely on the integrity, talent, efficiency, or durability of any one source . FORECASTING VS. STRATEGY We act on our expectations of the future. But to co nfuse expectations with certainty is the road to disaster. Humility is the realization that you don’t know everything, or even everything about any particular thing, and it is an investor’s most vital asset. Ar rogance eventually ruins any investor – no matter how well he’d been d oing. "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 160 Once you get beyond the feeling that you must be ab le to predict the future, you can get down to the serious business of investing in a realistic manner. Since you can’t predict the futur e, you’ll develop a strategy that allows you to deal successfully with an uncertain world – a strategy that recognizes your own weaknesses and emotions, as well as your ignorance. Look at your expectations. Challenge the premises o n which they’re based. Be sure that this is what you expect to happen, rather than what you want to happen. Make sure that you are not simply going along with an ideological or investment slogan that hasn’ t been analyzed for accuracy. Make sure your expectations are sensible – not certain, just sensible. Sort through your expectations. Find those that dif fer from the common view and can be bet on in an investment mark et. When a news event seems to be significant, don’t ge t carried away. Act upon the event only when you interpret its sign ificance in a different way from other people. If your reaction i s the same as that of others, disregard it; it’s not worth betting on. When you identify a unique expectation, look for th e investment medium that most precisely matches your expectation . For example, if you believe the price of gold is going up, buy gold . On the other hand, buy a South African gold stock if you think the pri ce of gold is going up and the cost of mining won’t go up proportionate ly and the South African government will allow the gold mines to pro fit from the price increase and the particular company will manage its affairs efficiently and there’s little chance of labor problems or natu ral disaster. If you don’t have expectations about all these things, you shouldn’t buy a gold stock. Match the investment to the expectation as precisely as possible. See what odds the market is offering you. Is the lo ss-reward ratio worth acting upon? Do you have a reasonable chance of earning a"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 161 profit that’s 10 times greater than what you’ll los e if you’re wrong? Is the profit potential at least 50% for each year you ’ll probably have to hold the investment? Will the capital itself be rel atively safe from confiscation, default, or other hazards? If, at the moment, the loss-reward ratio isn’t favo rable, keep your eye on the investment. Perhaps its price will rise or f all to a level where it is possible to intelligently limit the loss potenti al to a smaller amount. Find the point of entry (the buying price) where th e loss potential is minimized. Before you purchase the investment, pick a stop-los s level that makes sense to you – and make sure the stop-loss accompan ies your instructions to buy. An idea of where you’ll sell i s worthless until it is a specific stop-loss instruction that someone else will act upon without consulting you. Don’t be afraid to take a loss if the price goes ag ainst you. The man who has never taken a loss is the man who still own s the 40-year bonds he bought in 1960. Small losses are the price you pay for the big profits you hope to get. They are inevitable. T he object always is a net profit for the total portfolio, not a win on ev ery transaction. If the price goes up, don’t grab a small profit and run. It is better to allow a small profit to evaporate in a price drop t han to miss the opportunity for the large profit that prompted you to make the investment. As the price rises, raise the stop-loss level. Try to find the level that, if triggered, would be confirmation that the trend is over, but that won’t be triggered as long as the trend remains alive. Keep your head, and don’t panic when you see what o ther people are doing. If their actions are different from yours, g ood; you can’t make money doing what everyone else is doing. Even when they profit, don’t feel remorse that you didn’t venture beyond y our own abilities."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 162 And if you never take anything for granted, you’ll remain skeptical about the easy possibilities that others are toutin g, you’ll keep your eyes open for the things that may go wrong, you’ll be diversified enough to prevent any single disaster from being a catastrophe. LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF You’ll find that your strategy (whether you use thi s one or one you develop yourself) won’t be fool-proof. No strategy will be fool-proof. Stop-losses will be triggered, followed by higher p rices. Things will happen that you never considered. You’ll spot mista kes in your strategy that you’ll think should have been obvious to you before. Try not to reproach yourself for your mistakes; the y are as inevitable as the small losses. Try to acknowledge them as soo n as they surface – and learn from them. Revise the strategy to incorpo rate what you’ve learned. Life is a process of growing up. The more we grow u p, the more successful we are; but we never arrive at a level w here there’s no more growing-up to be done. So don’t reproach yours elf for not having been all grown-up yesterday. And recognize t hat, no matter how smart you are today, you’re not going to look a s smart from tomorrow’s perspective. Today’s smart move may be j ust one more mistake when reviewed tomorrow. Investing is an aspect of life. You have to live by the same rules as in any other part of life. And in your investment acti ons you express the same emotions, the same weaknesses, and the same st rengths. Because the investment world is generally more inte nse and moves faster than other areas of life, it is an opportuni ty to see yourself in action more dramatically.

And if you genera lize on what you discover about yourself and your methods, you have the opportunity to apply what you learn to other areas of your life – ways of making decisions, methods of dealing with weaknesses or un certainty, and areas of strength. After all, what I have been trying to formulate in this article is the same as a guide to living: Admit your mistakes and pay your losses so that you can get a fresh start; make sure your goal is high enough to be worth the effort; develop a way of life that sui ts your nature; be skeptical about what others say would be good for y ou; stay with a good thing as long as it pays off."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 164 FINDING & USING THE EFFICIENT STOP-LOSS March 9, 1980 An important part of the investment strategy involv es locating the efficient stop-loss level – the highest price that indicates that the investment is not now in an uptrend. Almost any stop-loss is better than no stop-loss at all. But the more proficient you are at choosing stop-loss levels, th e better will be your overall investment results. SUPPORT & RESISTANCE LEVELS It is assumed that an investment price will both ri se and fall, even in the midst of a trend that is clearly upward or down ward. But a fall through certain price levels can be a signal that a n uptrend is probably over. Such a level is referred to as a support level . Heavy buying will occur whenever the price drops to a support level, thus h alting a decline. If the decline does not stop at that level, its failure to do so is an indication that the relationship between buying pow er and selling power has changed – and that a major downtrend may have begun. The standard for choosing a stop-loss price is to l ocate the support level nearest to the current price. The stop-loss is then placed about 3% below that le vel (to provide a margin for error). During a normal fluctuation, a p rice decline will halt above the stop-loss, leaving you in the market . But a major downtrend will trigger the stop-loss, getting you o ut of the market before the price drops too far. "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 165 Support levels are also resistance levels – prices at which major selling will occur whenever they are approached fro m below. A price moving upward will stall (or run into resistance) a t about the same level where it would stall if approached from above . For example, if $50 is a support level that tends to stop a decline from a higher price, it should also be a resistance level that would hal t a rise from below. Support-resistance levels are created by the action s of investors and other participants in the market. In the commodity markets, a support level is often created because many consumers of th e commodity find it to be a price at which it is practical and econo mical to buy. And resistance levels are often points at which it is p rofitable for producers of the commodity to sell. In addition, habitual investor patterns of buying a nd selling create support and resistance levels. Some of these patter ns are explained in chapters 9 and 29 of the New Profits book. The support-resistance levels will be unique for ea ch investment. To locate them, you need to study a price-history grap h of the investment. Look for price levels where price rises and decline s have stalled in the past; the more often a price has stalled at a given level, the more reliable that level can be considered to be. For some investments, the support-resistance levels will be obvious; for others, they will not be. When you are choosing among investments that each have an attractive profit pot ential, it makes sense to choose the investment for which the suppor t-resistance levels are more clearly defined. ENTRY POINTS Trends usually unfold in waves – much like a proces s of advancing two steps forward, retreating one step backward, an d then advancing again. "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 166 Suppose, for simplicity, that the support-resistanc e levels for a given investment are at multiples of $10 -- $50, $60, $70 , $80, $90, and $100. In a classic uptrend, the investment would ri se to about $70 (a resistance level), retreat to $60 (the nearest supp ort level), rise through the $70 resistance level and on up to $80 (the next resistance level), retreat to $70 (now the nearest support level), and then continue upward to $90, etc. Suppose that the current price is $68. Even if you expect the price to go much higher, it would be a mistake to buy at $68 . Why? Because the price is just under a resistance level and quit e far above the nearest support level. The efficient stop-loss would be $58 (3% below the $60 support level), which is 15% below the current pric e of $68. You’re better off by waiting to see if the price is going to make it through the resistance level in this wave or if it will retreat back to the support level. If it retreats, you can buy closer t o $60; the efficient stop-loss, still at $58, will limit your potential loss to less than the 15% that was the case at $68. If, on the other hand , the price goes up from $68, you’re still better off waiting until the price has reached $72 (about 3% above the $70 resistance level), at which point the efficient stop-loss will become $68 – only 6% below a buying price at $72. Thus, in this case, it is safer to buy at $72 than at $68; the potential loss can be limited more efficiently. At any given current price, the loss-reward ratio m ay be uneconomic. But this might change as a result of either a price drop or a price rise. The loss-reward ratio will be the most favorable wh en the buying price is just above a support level, and the least favorable when it is just below a resistance level. NEW GROUND No support-resistance levels are identifiable in ra nges where the price has never been, since the levels can be identified only from past stalling points. You can always find the nearest su pport level in an"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 167 uptrend, but you may not know where the next resist ance level will be. Some technical systems claim to be able, through me asuring devises, to pick price objectives and resistance levels in u ncharted ranges. But I have not found these devices to be satisfactory. HELP Locating the efficient stop-loss isn’t the kind of job every investor is suited for – which is why we frequently suggest sto p-loss levels in this newsletter (along with providing investment ideas, locating new investments, and puncturing balloons). As pointed o ut in the preceding article, we can’t expect to be correct ev ery time. But if we pick the right stop-loss levels a majority of the t ime, the overall results will be profitable. "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 168 THE THEORY OF CONTRARY OPINION, R.I.P. February 9, 1984 One interpretation of the Theory of Contrary Opinio n says, “If a majority of investment advisors are in agreement ab out something, they must be wrong; the object of their agreement m ust be past its peak and on its way out.” If that’s true, the Theory of Contrary Opinion itse lf must be on its way out. And that will be a relief. It seems sometimes that every advisor in the world is leaning on Contrary Opinion to justify his viewpoint. While there are aspects of the Theory that make sen se and can be helpful, its widespread “use” has become silly. Supposedly, the price of an investment will move in the opposite direction from that expected by a majority of advis ors. As a result, many advisors justify their opinions by saying that the majority of advisors are on the other side of the fence. I often see two opposing opinions on an investment within the same day – each justified by the claim that the writer’s opinion is opposite to that of the majority of advisors. No matter what an advisor’s position, he’s always in that lonely, independent m inority that’s the home of all great thinkers. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the TCO (The ory of Contrary Opinion) is that I’ve never seen anyone make a deci sion based on it. Have you ever seen an advisor write something like: As you know, I was bullish on gold [or whatever] in the last issue. But now 80% of the advisory services are bullish, and so gold must be headed downward – and I’m turning bearish. "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 169 I’ve never seen anyone say that. The Theory of Cont rary Opinion is invoked only to justify a position already establis hed. In fact, I have read statements such as: The only negative in the bullish picture is that th e latest reading of advisory services shows that 80% are bullish. This is reason for caution. But since all the rest of our indicators point upward, we’re going to plunge in and buy. We’ll keep an eye on the bullish consensus, bu t as of now it appears to be an aberration. In other words, the TCO is important to an advisor only when it confirms what he wants to believe anyway. THE LOGIC IN THE THEORY As I understand it, the original TCO could have bee n stated as: If most people are bullish, we can assume that almo st everyone who is inclined to buy has already done so, leaving very l ittle new buying power left to move the price higher. Conversely, if most people are bearish, then everyone who is included to see probably has done s o already, and there should be no further downward selling pressure on t he price. This makes sense. However, there are many principle s that make sense but are unusable because there’s no way to ob tain the data necessary to apply them. For instance, inflation (or the absence of it) resu lts from the interaction between the demand for money and the su pply of money. Unfortunately, there is no way to measure the deman d for money – except long after the fact. Consequently, one can understand the supply-demand principle, but can’t apply it to anticipate future inflation. In the same way, it makes sense to “buy when blood is running in the streets” because the outlook for a given investment should never be worse, and so the price may never be lower. But wha t journal publishes an accurate measurement of the level of b lood in the streets?"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 170 And perhaps, it’s true that major trend reversals o ccur when the public is overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, but we have n o infallible way to know at any time how bullish or bearish the public really is. We can only guess. And our guesses are likely to be influe nced by what we want to believe. Even if we really knew, it wouldn’t be enough. What we actually need to know is how much buying power is still available for an investment. For example, if 80% of the public are b ullish, it might be that the 20% who aren’t yet bullish have 60% of the investment funds at their disposal—and so represent large, as yet un tapped, resources that might still push the price a good deal higher. Although Barron’s publishes a great many indicators , it doesn’t offer one that says, for example: 35.4% of the adult population, with 29.6% of the av ailable investment funds, are bullish on gold; 64.6%, with 70.4% of th e available funds, are bearish. CONTRARY OPINION INDICATORS To compensate for this lack of data, various indica tors have been created by which investors hope to measure public o pinion. The most popular proxy has been the measurement of advisors’ sentiments. Someone reads a lot of investment newsl etters and monitors the recommendations of large brokerage com panies – using what he finds to construct an index of advisory sen timent. This will be reported as, say, a “60% bullish consensus on stock s” – meaning that 60% of the advisors expect stocks to go up. One might consult such an index, believing that at a given level of bullishness – say, 70% or more – an investment must have peaked because almost everyone who could buy has already d one so. But, unfortunately, an index of advisory sentiment is pr etty meaningless."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 171 What advisors appear to be recommending is in no wa y a confirmation of what investors have done or are doi ng. For one reason, the advisor’s customers might not d o what he recommends. Numerous subscribers have told me they read my “Farewell to Silver” article in 1980, but many of t hem said they held on to their silver after reading the article. And y et any index of advisory sentiment that included me as a component would have registered me as bearish in January 1980. For another reason, at any given time, people might be bullish but might not have bought yet. I haven’t denied the bul l market in stocks, but I also haven’t made a suggestion to buy stocks for the Variable Portfolio. I can’t be listed among the bears, but n one of the buying power I may represent has been used up. For still another reason, many people don’t always act in accordance with their stated opinions. I’ve met a lot of hard- money investors who say the banks aren’t safe but who still have their money in money market funds that are heavily invested in bank CDs. And for one final reason, people can be bullish and more bullish and even more bullish. I know a man who had been invest ed in silver for years, but who borrowed money from his bank to buy even more silver on the day it hit $50. By any standard, he w ould have been counted as “bullish” for a long time before that da y, and yet he managed to come up with the buying power for even m ore silver. The Best-Seller Indicator Another contrary-opinion ploy that surfaces from ti me to time is the best-seller-list indicator. Any time an investment book shows up on the best-seller lists, assume that the investment i t’s pushing is about to peak and fall. "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 172 I recently saw a newsletter article pushing this ol d superstition as though it were a brilliant new discovery. Maybe it was to the author of the article. He recited the history of investment best-sellers f rom Adam Smith’s The Money Game in 1968 to John Naisbitt’s Megatrends in 1983. But to make history confirm his point, it was necessary to distort the contents of some of the books he cited (books that were in fact giving timely and correct advice), and it also was necessa ry to overlook a number of other best-sellers that happened to be sa ying the right things at the right times. As with all the really great technical indicators, a guru is needed to decide which best-sellers are indicators and which should be ignored – and, too often, even the guru can’t do that correct ly until years after the fact. Other Indicators Another supposed indicator is to watch the covers o f the news magazines. When Time or Newsweek has a gold bar on the cover, you supposedly know that the bull market in gold is ove r. Cute, but unfortunately not infallible. Still another indicator is the measurement of the c ash positions of mutual funds. If mutual funds have less than, say, 5% of their assets in cash, they have little left with which to push up s tock prices. If they have 10% or more, perhaps they’ve sold all the stoc ks they’re going to sell – and their 10% cash position is buying power that can cause the market to rally. This indicator is the closest to being useful, beca use it actually measures money – not presumed opinions. But this in dicator has problems, too: mutual funds aren’t the whole market , fund managers can decide to increase their cash holdings to well beyond 10% (to"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 173 100%,in fact), and some of them use margin so that a small cash position doesn’t mean that their buying power is ex hausted. Unfortunately, there’s no way to know whether the p ublic is overwhelmingly bullish or bearish about anything. THE THEORY PERVERTED As I said, I believe the basic idea behind the Theo ry of Contrary Opinion is correct – even if it seldom can be imple mented. But, as with any theory, this one has been corrupte d over time by people who can’t understand the reasoning behind it , by people who want everything to be simple, and by people who wan t to use it to justify a point of view. The most popular corruptio n has been the simple-minded attitude that the public is always wrong . The article on best-sellers contains such a premise : “. . . a universally accepted view about the business or investment outl ook will be wrong. In other words, adopt a different or ‘contra ry’ view when opinion is extremely one-sided.” But why must the majority always be wrong? Unfortunately, if you ask this, the answer usually is a mystical quote fr om some great thinker about the loneliness of creation or “the ma n who stands alone,” but no logical reason that the majority mus t always be wrong. The truth is that the majority isn’t always wrong ( or right). A one- sided majority of people believe the earth is round . An overwhelming majority of Americans believed throughout World War II that America would win the war – and they made their bus iness and investment plans accordingly. And it looked to me t hroughout the second half of 1982 that most investors believed st ocks were in a bull market – and they were right. Importance of Majority Opinion"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 174 The importance of knowing the majority’s opinion ha s been perverted by the TCO advocates. It isn’t that the majority is always wrong. It is that you can’t make large profits betting with the majority. If the majority believes stocks are going higher, i t doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going lower; it means only that prices are already so high that you can no longer buy at bargain prices. You will bet a lot to make a little – when you should be in the position of risking a little in the hope of making a lot. For example, in 1981, I tried to point out that the “beat inflation” strategy of borrowing money to buy tangible assets (like gold) couldn’t be as useful in 1981 as it had been in 197 1 – because, by 1981, what you knew was also understood by everyone else. You’d be betting with the majority. You’d be buying gold at $500 instead of $35, and you’d be paying 18% interest in stead of 8%. The majority might have turned out to be right in their inflation expectations of 1981. But had that happened, you’d have made only a little from being on their side – while risking a g reat deal. In other words, inflation hedges are valuable to ow n only when very few people believe inflation is coming. So it’s important to be sure that you aren’t bettin g with the majority when you’re speculating. But that’s quite different from assuming that the majority is always wrong. Snobbery For some reason, many otherwise humble people give vent to a terrible snobbery when they approach investing. Advisors and investors love to believe that they ar e members of a small elite of wise, savvy insiders – while the maj ority of investors are"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 175 dumb sheep who know no better than to follow the cr owd off the edge of the investment cliff. The Perverted Theory of Contrary Opinion appeals m ightily to this snobbery. It’s wonderful to believe that the majori ty is always wrong – and that you’re always on the other side for the majority. CONCLUSION The Theory of Contrary Opinion is just one more way by which people hope to simplify a complicated world – a tri ck they hope will take the work and risk out of investing, and a ploy by which they can try to appear to be superior to the “crowd.” As I said at the outset, if the Theory is right, it s widespread acceptance must mean that the Theory itself has pas sed its peak – and perhaps, mercifully, we will be spared from hearing so much about it in the future. 2   2 This isn’t meant to be an exhaustive study of the T heory of Contrary Opinion. So I haven’t discussed the many times the odd-lot short- sellers turned out to be right, or the way the publ ic selling its silver heirlooms in 1979-1980 proved to be smarter than the silver analysts, or many other ways in which the Theory has failed to live up to its promises."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 176 WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE PAST February 9, 1984 Most technical analysts are aficionados of the past . They believe the past holds secrets that, if deciphered, would provi de keys to the future. And so they sift through the past for recurring pat terns that can be used as indicators for the future. I believe their search is mostly futile. In this sh ort article, I’ll try to show what I believe we can and can’t learn from the past. On the Front Page of issue 72, I discussed the prac tice by which investment advisors look through the history of a g iven investment to find the moving average that has provided the best buy and sell signals. This search for the ideal moving average c an serve as a starting point for my discussion of the use we can make of the past. MOVING AVERAGES An investment’s moving average for any given day is the average of all its prices over the recent period designed in t he moving average. Thus, if you have a “50-week moving average,” today ’s “M.A.” will be the investment’s average price during the past 5 0 weeks. It is called a “moving” average because it changes every day – as the oldest day’s price is dropped and the current day’s price is added to the set of prices from which the average is taken. Because this daily change has only a small effect o n the resulting average, the moving average is much less volatile t han the daily price. And the longer the period covered, the less the ave rage will be affected b each day’s changing price – and, thus, t he less volatile it will be. "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 177 A moving average of some length (say, 40 weeks or m ore) generally will remain below the price for most of a prolonged bull market, and above it during a prolonged bear market. That is, t he current price, aimed in the direction of the major trend, will sta y ahead of its moving average for most of a prolonged trend. So a common strategy is to buy an investment when i ts current price rises above its moving average, and sell the invest ment as soon as its price falls below the moving average. Sometimes, however, the price will fall below the m oving average (signaling the start of a bear market) only to rise again and go to new highs. So the dedicated technical analyst will sear ch through the past, checking every possible moving average – perhaps fr om 20 weeks to 80 weeks – looking for the one that has produced th e most profitable signals for the investment being studied. When he finds one, he’ll print a chart showing how well this particular moving average has produced signals tell ing you when to by and sell. If the signals were correct every time during the period studied, he may even refer to the average as an “in fallible” indicator. The Best of the Past In my remarks on the Front Page of issue 72, I said the fact that one indicator had worked best for the period tested doe sn’t tell a thing about the future. Every test will produce a winning indicator – even if the indicator is useless. And even within the perio d studied, different sub-periods usually will produce different winners. This prompted a reader to send me a rebuttal. He sa id that he’d seen studies of moving-average strategies that have done a better job of identifying buy and sell points than I’ve done late ly buy buying at what I thought were support levels. He said:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 178 I don’t see why you have to have the “best” moving average to identify the trend as being up/down/sideways. You n eed to know only that, in the past, a strategy using a given M.A. al lowed one to pick off a good part of the rise. The key words are “in the past.” The M.A. (or other ) study tells you only that a particular pattern occurred in the past . You can’t project from the past an assurance for the future. As someo ne once said, “If the past could predict the future, we’d all be bill ionaires.” 1 In the past, the Yankees won the World Series, Rich ard Nixon was elected President, the earth orbited around the sun , the dollar crashed against foreign currencies. These events of themselves are not guides to future events. Each one needs to be examined to see whether there’s a physical or human-nature reason for it to repeat itself. Of these events, only the earth-sun relationship ca n be explained in such a way that we expect it to recur regularly. Th e others might happen again, but they don’t have to. In fact, they have no more chance to occur than an alternative chosen at rando m. You might convince me that, say, the dollar will cr ash again. But you can do so only by offering evidence of today’s conditions, coupled with a logical explanation of why those conditions must lead to a crash – not by saying that it will happen because i t happened before. As with the Yankees’ past glories, a given moving a verage might happen to have done this or that in the past. But, to my knowledge, no one has even tried to explain logically why a price that falls below its moving average must continue falling.   1 I think it was Jimmy Carter on election night, 1980"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 179 The fact that the same moving average doesn’t “win” the test for every investment, as well as the fact that other mo ving averages don’t provide winning results, should alert you to the pr obability that we’re dealing with a random coincidence. PERFECT SYSTEMS One of my investment principles is that systems suc h as this work perfectly in the past but poorly in the future. There’s nothing mystical about this principle. The originator of the system is showing you the “cause-and-effect relatio nship” that happened to win the random study he conducted; so o f course it worked perfectly in the past. But if there is no na tural reason for the existence of this relationship, it will work poorly in the future. If you use a computer to generate 5,000 random one- digit numbers, one of those numbers (between 0 and 9) will occur t he most often. If the winner is 6, does that tell us anything about t he nature of life and numbers? Even if 6 happened to be generated far mor e than 10% of the time, would you attach any special significance to it? 2 If one moving average happened to produce unerring buy and sell signals in the past, does that tell us anything abo ut the nature of investments – the way investors behave in the marke ts—or provide a strategy for profiting? The past is important to us, and it shouldn’t be ignored. I re alize that, to justify various actions, the slogan “Those who i gnore history are condemned to repeat it” is invoked as often and as uselessly as “Buy   2 I know you wouldn’t think that any number has a spe cial significance in economics or investments. But did you know that many technical analysts believe that the number .618 is special?

"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 180 when blood is flowing in the streets.” Even so, the truth is that we do need to consider what has happened before. But the value of the past is in telling us what to avoid , not what to do. Data Mining Statistical analysis is used for one of two purpose s – to create a theory or to test a theory. In the investment world, stati stical analysis is used by technicians mostly to create theories or strateg ies. In the academic world, this is known as “data mining” – that is, mi ning through mountains of data in hopes of finding some breathta king cause-and- effect relationship. If an analyst finds one (such as “a 48 ½-week movin g average produces infallible buy and sell signals for greasy wool futures”), he has no idea why this should be so – only that it is so (or apparently is so). And thus originates the technician’s timeworn, fail-safe, fall- back-upon justification: “I don’t know why this wor ks, but it always does.” Unfortunately, it doesn’t always work. It happened consistently during a specific period of time. And when it doesn’t happ en in the future, the technician will have to choose between expandin g his principle to include exceptions, going back to the computer to l ook for an even better indicator, or finding a way to cram the squa re head of current reality into the round hold of his theory. The principle that “systems work perfectly in the p ast but poorly in the future” is true because you hear only about sys tem that would have worked well in the past – systems that were uncover ed by data mining. Because there is no basis in human action f or the system that was uncovered, there is no reason for it to work in the future. PROPER USE OF THE PAST "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 181 On the other hand, analysis of the past is very use ful in testing a hypothesis that was created by deductive reasoning – applying principles of human action to specific areas of eco nomics or investing. If your understanding of the world tells you that C ause A should always lead to Effect B, you necessarily will want to examine past instances of Cause A to see if they did in fact alw ays lead to Effect B. For example, Terry Coxon and I developed a group of Permanent Portfolios (including one for the Fund) on the basi s of logic – how we believed various investments should respond to vari ous economic events. Having done so, we wanted to be sure that t he real world hadn’t, at some time in the past, shown our logic t o be faulty. As a test, we commissioned Data Resources to run co mputerized portfolio simulations from 1970 forward – to see ho w our portfolios would have performed during the circumstances of th ose years. In general, the results matched our expectations, but it did call attention to elements we’d overlooked. For one example, we di scovered that the portfolios weren’t as stable as we’d expected and w anted them to be, and so we increased the Treasury-bill allocations t o dampen the volatility. Suppose, on the other hand, we had programmed the c omputer to discover the portfolio that would have produced the best result during the period 1970-1980.

The world is made up of billions of people and othe r influences. The events of the past weren’t subjected to all the inf luences that might affect the events of the future.

Is it a mistake to buy when ther e’s “widespread pessimism” about an investment – as there seemed to be about gold last year?

How do you know whether there is “widespread” pessi mism in the gold market now or just “some” pessimism? Do you as k the street cleaners if they found blood in the streets today? Unfortunately, no one can measure pessimism numerically, so you won’t find it quoted in a table in The Wall Street Journal . Ask a successful investor how he knew to buy or sel l at a profitable time, and he may recite an age-old rule as the answ er. Ask him how he knew that the time was right to apply the rule, and he may say that the conditions were right. Ask him how he knew the conditions were right, and he’ll probably say that his experience guided him. Lastly, ask him what specifically in his experience guided him, and I doubt that he’l l be able to answer. Why not? There must have been some particular match -up between the past and the present by which he interpreted th e situation. There probably was, but it isn’t surprising that he can’t identify it. He reacted intuitively to the situation – as we all do to familiar situations. EXPERIENCE & INTUITION Each of us relies on a fund of knowledge accumulate d from experience. But the knowledge is so vast and compl icated that, most of the time, you use it without noticing that you’r e drawing on it. This knowledge is employed in the form of intuition – which is the unconscious processing of data from your own experi ence. There’s nothing mystical about intuition. It isn’t a strange gift that enables a psychic to divine the future or read mind s. Intuition is"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 185 simply the use of knowledge acquired from experienc e – without conscious attention to its use. For example, you drive a car by intuition; you don’ t say “Now I’ll tilt the wheel slightly to the left... now I’ll tilt it slight to the right.” Nor do you explain to yourself why you’re doing these t hings. You act automatically because your mind is processi ng your image of the road and the other cars without your having to focus consciously on every decision and act. In fact, if a passenger asked why you did a particular thing, you might find it difficult to ex plain; you weren’t paying attention when you acted, you made the decis ion unconsciously. The execution of most acts is done intuitively – ea ting, walking, typing, talking, most labor. You don’t analyze each step, you just do it. However, you can do these things automatically only because you’ve already learned how to do them. Once the knowledge is acquired, it goes into some remote corner of your mind – to be u sed in the future, but never noticed directly.

I realized then that the lavatory would have been dark the previous time if I hadn’t locked the door. The light in the lavatory had assured me that I’d l ocked the door. I’d acquired that understanding through years of flying , but without once noticing that the lavatory light comes on only when you bolt the door. As a result, I was unable to explain my assurance t o the stewardess. For a hypothetical example, suppose you walk into a restaurant for the first time, get a bad feeling about it, and want to leave. Your companion says that you’re being silly – that this place has the best reputation in town. As it turns out, the service is bad, the food is lousy, and a fistfight breaks out at the next table . You may never know what gave you the warning that s omething was wrong. But probably something you saw reminded you unconsciously of a bad experience you’d had elsewhere. In the sam e way, you might be wary of an investment even if you can’t rebut th e arguments made on its behalf. Intuition is an important part of life because one can never acquire all the data necessary to make a decision by conscious calculation alone. So an investor acts when the situation feels right to him – meaning his intuition signals that the situation corresponds to earlier situations that proved to be profitable. And he refrains from actin g when the situation doesn’t feel right. If it turns out that he was correct, he may not be able to explain his decision, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t have good reasons for it. 2   2 In modern jargon, the word instinct often is used ( incorrectly) to justify an intuitive decision one can’t explain. Bu t instincts are"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 187 Experience Required It isn’t that intuition is always correct; intuitio n can make mistakes. But everyone’s reactions are at least partly intuit ive, so it’s impossible for anyone to lay out a set of rules telling how he would react in each and every situation. Everyone is guided by an intui tion that’s built up from years of individual experience, experience tha t can’t simply be handed over to others. Many people believe they can succeed just by doing whatever their “gut feelings” tell them. Most of them are in big t rouble. One’s intuition is only as valid as the background from w hich it flows. Your intuition is useful in a specific field only a fter experience has built up a mental data bank that your intuition can draw upon. Even then, unnoticed factors might influence your intuit ion incorrectly. So an intelligent person usually won’t do what logic t ells him is unrealistic. Why Rules Are Incomplete Because so many decisions are made intuitively, rul es coined from successful actions inevitably will be incomplete. A legendary financier may attribute his wealth to the rule “I a lways sold too soon.” But only his intuitive reactions to the market, mol ded by years of experience, told him “how soon” was “too soon.” Con sequently, you or I might find it very difficult to profit from hi s rule. This is one reason that technical analysis works fo r some investors but not for others who know and apply the same rules. A pplying the rules calls for subjective judgments that not everyone is equipped to make well.       motivations that preserve a species – such as hunge r, sex, etc. They have nothing to do with decision-making or with one ’s own background."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 188 Computer systems for technical analysis seldom work for any length of time because the computer doesn’t have enough ex perience. All the computer knows are past prices and the formal rules that have been programmed into it. Even the most successful trader can’t write a complete program of rules, because he can’t identif y everything he relies on in making decisions; too much of his know ledge has been stored in his own intuitive data bank. Because we rely so much on intuition, two investors can agree on a rule but disagree on any given application of it. T o one, a pint of blood in the streets is a buy signal; the other hol ds back until the blood is knee-deep. And in some cases, even if an investor has stated h is quantity requirement and has seen that much blood, he may de cide at the last moment that he wants to know the blood type before acting. WHERE THE RULES COME FROM When trying to use rules, it’s valuable to understa nd how they come into existence. An individual’s success stems from his intelligence , aptitude, conscious knowledge, and intuition. Rules are imper fect attempts to explain this success. Most are invented in one of t wo ways. The first occurs when a successful, but inarticulat e, person is asked to explain his success. Despite his talent, he may be unable to describe his methods. In trying to explain, he may focus on something irrelevant, or he may coin a rule that doesn’t real ly tell how he’d handle future situations. Or he may fall back on textbook rules he’s heard bu t doesn’t really follow. For example, if you ask a top salesman to a ccount for his success, he may stammer and then say, “Well, I know my product,"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 189 always make an extra call every day, never take ‘no ’ for an answer, remember everyone’s name, and shine my shoes.” Whil e this lends credence to the company’s sales manual, it doesn’t tell you how to emulate the salesman’s success. Rules also arise from attempts by others to analyze the work of a successful person. It’s said that most textbooks on music composition derive from the attempts of musicologists to analyz e the work of Johann Sebastian Bach. They discovered when he woul d use a given harmony, when he wouldn’t, etc. Their discoveries h ave become the basis of composition theory. But no other composer became great by following the se rules to the letter. Instead, the later “greats” broke many of t he “Bachian” rules. Their innovations led to additional rules that were , in turn, broken by later successful composers. Rules are imperfect attempts to describe that actio ns of successful individuals. And the rules are particularly imperfe ct in identifying the occasions when exceptions would be made. It isn’t that the rules are wrong, unworkable, or i dealistic. It’s that they can be employed profitably only if accompanied by a feel for when the rules apply. And that feel is developed throug h experience; it can’t be found in a textbook."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 190 APTITUDES Profitable investing requires more than just the ex perience that creates the right intuitive responses. Investing isn’t a science – like physics or chemist ry. If it were, you could invest successfully as easily as you can turn on an electric light; you’d need only to follow the instructions of those who had created the instrument at hand. Investing is an art – for which one must have an ap titude. Some people study music for years and never compose a pi ece that anyone wants to hear. Others take ten college math courses and never learn to be comfortable with elementary algebra. And many pe ople who learn all they can about investing never show a profit. Investors who lose continually may have no aptitude for investing. Without the aptitude, the time spent soaking up exp erience will be wasted. However, unlike with music and math, almost everyon e has to make decisions about investments. Too much of life invol ves a sense of investing – even if only deciding whether to put $3 00 in the bank. Almost no one can ignore investing with impunity. S o it’s necessary to find a way to make investment decisions – with o r without an aptitude. Recognizing Your Aptitude Actually, it’s an oversimplification to say that on e either has or hasn’t an aptitude for investing. Most individuals are nei ther investment geniuses nor investment dunces, but fall somewhere in between. Whatever your place on the scale, it’s important to acknowledge it – to recognize how much aptitude you have. Success do esn’t come from"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 191 pretending you’re more qualified than you are, from just wanting to succeed, or from following rules religiously withou t the aptitude to employ them. Neither should you decide that you’re unsuited for investing simply because you’ve followed a few rules without success . It may be that what you’ve been trying is ill suited to your aptit ude and experience. It’s important also to identify how much you enjoy investing. You may be good at it, but still prefer spending your t ime doing other things. You shouldn’t adopt an investment strategy that requires a degree of attention you don’t want to give. For someone who either has no aptitude or has no in terest, there’s no simple solution – such as “Just put your money in. . .” If you wealth is important to you, you’ll have to devote some time t o managing and protecting it. But if you accept your situation, yo u can develop a plan that relies on a minimum of what you’re short of – aptitude or interest or both. Putting 100% of your wealth in a balanced Permanent Portfolio is one example of such an approach. The portfolio won’t ma terialize on its own; you’ll have to do some work, learn some things , and spend some time to set it up. But having done so, the portfoli o might be the easiest and safest arrangement you could devise. In fact, the very existence of a Permanent Portfoli o (as opposed to having 100% in the Variable Portfolio) is a sign of respect for your limitations. It’s a recognition that no one’s aptit ude or knowledge is great enough to assure that short-term investment d ecisions can’t go wrong."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 192 RULES Whatever course you choose, the rules defined by ot hers can help you. But rules are never complete. They usually presuppo se total knowledge of current conditions without providing t hat knowledge. The application of a rule depends upon personal exp erience. And because so much experience is used intuitively, we can’t expect a rule to explain every application of itself. In addition, any rule must be placed within the con text of who you are, what you know, and what you’re capable of doin g. And so, to close this article on rules, let me sugg est a few rules: 1. Rules that are said to be the basis of someone’s s uccess should be studied for their potential value. But a rule can’t transfer another person’s aptitude or experience to you. 2. There have been individuals who were both great inv estors and great teachers (Gerald Loeb, for example). But, in general, don’t assume that a financial genius can explain how his genius works. You would be confusing two different talents. 3. Any rule has hidden exceptions. Not even the most a rticulate genius can tell you what he’d do in every conceivab le situation. He knows only that, when the time comes, he’ll know wh at to do. 4. Contrary to one rule, an exception does not “prove the rule.” An exception calls attention to a rule. When you see a Japanese tourist without a camera, you’re aware intuitively that som ething is strange. After thinking about it, you realize what was strange – and you coin the rule that Japanese tourists usually ha ve cameras hanging from their necks. Be alert to exceptions; t hey can help to identify and refine your own rules. "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 193 5. A rule isn’t a command. You don’t have to buy when blood is running in the streets. In fact, one rule may confl ict with another one – Buy when. . .” and “Never buy when. . .”. You have to decide for yourself when to apply a rule – using yo ur own experience and values. 6. While a rule isn’t a command, it may be a reassuran ce. The “pessimism” rule that began this article can’t tell you when to buy gold. But if other considerations indicated that go ld is a good investment now, the rule would remind you not to be deterred by what seemed to be widespread pessimism about gold’s prospects. 7. Don’t try to use a rule that’s contrary to what you believe to be the nature of life and human action. Someone may say th at he profits from such a rule, but his success may stem from som ething else entirely. 8. A rule that appears to be wrong may have a kernel o f truth. Examine it, measure it by what you know about life, and modify it to suit your own way of thinking. 9. If an investment rule or system seems to make sense , try for a while to employ it on paper – making definite decis ions and writing them down, but not investing any money. You still may decide that the rule is sensible, but that its exec ution isn’t obvious. However, the more you work with it, the more you’ll develop a feel for how to apply it. 10. Be wary of an investment strategy that’s over your head. Don’t risk any large sums trying to do something until yo u know that you possess the necessary aptitude – and that you can g ive it the attention it demands. Again, try it on paper first; see whether it’s something you can handle. 11. Be wary also of advice that says, “In today’s world , everyone must be a [speculator, short-seller, international expert,"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 194 whatever].” Not everyone can be, and some people are sure to lose what they have if they try. 12. Even if you have an aptitude for investing, and eve n if you have good rules to work with, you’ll have to serve an ap prenticeship before a great deal of success can come your way. Y ou need to acquire the experience that will generate the right intuitive reactions to market conditions. 13. Intuition is valuable and should be respected. But a “gut feeling” that things will work out is no substitute for a st op-loss order. The more experience you have, the more valid your feeli ngs are; but everyone’s intuition leads him astray sometimes. In any conflict between feelings and logic, let logic prevail. 14. Don’t despair if you try a strategy and can’t succe ed with it. Just because you can’t be a doctor doesn’t mean you can’ t make a living; just because Sophia Loren doesn’t know you’ re alive doesn’t mean you can’t be loved. And just because o ne investment strategy is over your head doesn’t mean there isn’t another that would suit you well. "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 195 MR. JONES’ INCREDIBLE FORECASTER February 13, 1985 On Monday, Mr. Jones received a strange letter in t he mail. There was no sender’s name or return address on the envelope or the letter – just a sheet of paper with a single senten ce typed on it: The stock market will go up on Tuesday. Intrigued by this strange note, Mr. Jones made it a point to check the stock market closing on Tuesday – and was surprised to find that, indeed, the market had gone up. On Thursday, he received a similar note, saying onl y: The stock market will go down on Friday. He called his broker and placed an order to buy a s tock index futures contract at the close of the day (Monday) – with a second instruction to sell the contract at the close on Tuesday. Mr. Jones didn’t go to work on Tuesday. He called i n sick and spent the day at his broker’s office, watching the market prices on a video screen. The market had a very good day – and Mr. Jo nes made a profit of over $500 on his little investment. On Thursday, he received another letter: The stock market will go up on Friday. He called his broker again, but this time he bought six contracts. And, sure enough, the market was up on Friday.

So he didn’t go to work the following Monday or Tuesday. Instead, he waited anxiously for the next word from the anonymous stock market geniu s.

But this one was diffe rent. It said: You know now that I can forecast the market perfect ly. If you want to know what the market will do on Friday, send $500 i n cash in an envelope addressed to Mr. Smith, c/o General Delive ry at the downtown post office. Mr. Jones ran to his bank to get the cash. He sent the money as instructed. On Thursday, he received the precious a dvice: The stock market will go down on Friday.

The next letter asked for $1,000 for a forecast. He gladly paid it, received the forecast, and won another $4,500 in th e market. The subsequent letter asked for $2,000; he paid it, dou bled his futures contracts, and won around $6,000. The mysterious forecaster had correctly called the direction of the market seven times in a row."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 197 EXCITING PROSPECTS At this point, we interrupt the story, but we’ll co me back to it shortly. First, we’ll see some other examples of investment genius. By reading the ratings services, I’ve uncovered inv estment advisors who have managed to show profits every year for the past seven years – in up markets and down markets. Seven years in a row is too many to be attributed to just good luck. We also find perfect records elsewhere. There’s a t echnical indicator that’s predicted the stock market turns seven times in row. A string of successes this long could hardly be a coincidence. And there’s a moving average that’s signaled bull a nd bear markets in gold seven times in a row. Such consistency seems t oo great to be an accident; we can’t object to the moving average bei ng called a “confirmed, reliable indicator.” Lastly, a college professor teaching finance boasts of a student who’s picked seven winning investments in a row. It appea rs that an investment genius has been discovered. In each of these cases, the long string of successe s (seven in every example) seems to prove that the results didn’t com e from coincidence, luck, or special circumstances that ar e unreliable. And the potential suggested by these discoveries is truly exciting. GENIUS AT WORK Perhaps we should look more closely at one of the e xamples. It turns out that the college student’s investment success g rew out of a classroom experiment. "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 198 Each student was asked to make his “investment” by flipping a coin. If the coin came up “heads”, the investment was con sidered to be a success. A “tails” result meant that the investment failed. So the exemplary student flipped “heads” seven times in a row; he didn’t actually choose any investments. But, still, just flipping “heads” seven consecutive times is itself quite a feat. Can you imagine what the odds are against suc h a thing? They must be astronomical. However, we should understand how the experiment wa s conducted. There were 128 students in the class. Each of them flipped a coin to determine the outcome of his “investment”. If his c oin came up “heads”, he won; if he flipped “tails”, he lost. The experiment was conducted in seven stages: 1. All 128 students flipped their coins. The results w ere: 66 “heads” and 62 “tails:. The professor told the losers to wi thdraw from the experiment. 2. The remaining 66 flipped again. When they did, 31 f lipped “heads”. The other 35 withdrew. 3. On the next test, 17 winners, 8 flipped “heads” on the next test. 5. Of these 8, 4 flipped “heads” again. 6. Of those 4, 3 flipped “heads” on the next test. 7. Of the 3 remaining, only one flipped “heads” on the final test. So we have one student who was able to flip “heads” seven times in a row. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 199 Taken out of context, this student’s accomplishment had seemed amazing. But taken in context, it doesn’t seem remarkable that one student out of 128 succeeded in flipping “heads’ se ven times in a row. 1 In each of the seven stages, approximately half the flippers produced “heads” – just what you’d expect. If you start with enough people (around 128) and eliminate the losers each time, th e odds favor an outcome in which one or more students will flip “he ads” seven times in a row. The Odds Have It The odds against flipping “heads” on any one toss a re 1 to 1 (which is the same as saying you have 1 chance in 2 of succee ding). Against flipping twice in a row, the odds are 3 to 1 (1 cha nce in 4). Against flipping seven times in a row, the odds are 127 to 1 (1 chance in 128). That may seem to be big odds, but if you s tart with 128 people, the odds favor an outcome in which at least one person has accomplished the “impossible”. It doesn’t matter what the setting is – coin-flippi ng or investing or anything else. The odds are the same in any situation with two possible outcomes of roughly equal probability. For example, if each of 128 investment advisors has about an equal chance to show a gain or loss each year, there shou ld be at least one who shows a gain seven years in a row. And there ar e far ore than 128 advisors around.   1 Terry Coxon says that the probability that at least one student out of 128 would flip “heads” 7 times in a row is 63.4% . I’ll take his word for it."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 200 Chance in Investment Results If investment advice seems far removed from coin-fl ipping, consider this. Suppose that each of 128 investment advisors, at th e beginning of each year, decided whether to go long or short on g old (or any other investment) by flipping a coin – and then stuck wit h that decision throughout the year. At the end of seven years, you’ll probably have one advisor who was right every year (and one who was wrong every year) . And not one of them would have had to do an hour of research or look at a single chart. ‘PROVEN’ INDICATORS No wonder there are such things as the “Super Bowl Indicator” that seem to work somehow year after year. Out of thousa nds of possible indicators, there will be some that have won every year – no matter how obviously foolish the premise. 2 And if a computer sifts through daily gold prices f or all the years covering the last seven market turns, testing sever al hundred different moving averages, it’s bound to find one moving aver age (more likely several) that confirmed – quickly and accurately – each bull trend and each bear trend.   2 The “Super Bowl Indicator” says that if the winner of the Super Bowl (played in January) is a team that was I the old Am erican Football League, the stock market will show a net loss for t he year. Otherwise, the market will gain for the year. Although the res ults depend upon the index chosen to represent the stock market, the indicator has been accurate in almost every one of the past 18 years. "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 201 Realize this when you read of a “confirmed, reliab le” indicator that apparently has forecast a market correctly. Recogni ze that its record doesn’t tell you anything about its ability to do s o in the future. Realize, in fact, that there may be no logical conn ection between the indicator and market events. Even if there were no reason for any indicator to forecast future conditions, many indicators still would seem to do so for long periods in the past – simply because there is an infinity of possible indicators for investment advisors to choose from. On any day, some of these indicators are sure to have amazing track records – even if the results are pure coincidence. Explanation Needed No matter how many times an indicator (or advisor) has been right before, that fact alone offers no evidence that it (or he) will be right when you risk your money. What you need to know, beyond past success, is whet her there’s a logical connection between the indicator and the ma rket results – a connection arising from what we know about the way people act. How, for example, does the outcome of the Super Bow l affect the economy so as to determine the stock market’s direc tion? The answer to that is obvious: it doesn’t. But other indicators, residing within investment ma rkets rather than sports areas, may be equally meaningless. You have to put them to the test of logic, not just a computer printout. MYSTICISM If you can’t come up with a logical connection, the indicator is simply a mystical phenomenon. "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 202 Mysticism is a belief in something for which there’s no caus e-and- effect explanation. If a technical analyst believes that a “pennant for mation” on a chart signals a big upmove to come but can’t explain why (other than to say “it always has”), his faith is mystical. He may say he’s being “scientific,” but his technique is no more scientif ic than that of a witch doctor examining animal entrails for signs of the f uture. (This doesn’t mean that all technical analysis is m ysticism. There are charting rules that have grown out of realistic ide as about the way the world works. The mystical tools are the trendlines, pennant formations, moving averages, and such that came wit h no explanations for their existence. In my opinion, pr obably 80% of the technical tools I’ve seen are mystical.) Use of the Past The argument “I don’t know why it works but it alw ays has” is meaningless. You can’t use the past to prove an eco nomic hypothesis. Once logic has created a working hypothesis, you se arch the past to see if history has already refuted your presumed ca use-and-effect relationship. If you don’t find a refutation, you’r e encouraged to explore the relationship further. But a refutation may still occur tomorrow – so you’ve “proved” nothing. Hypotheses vs. Mysticism But you don’t even have a hypothesis if you can’t e xplain how A leads to F by following a logical trail through B, C, D, and E. Without that trail, you have nothing more than a mystical b elief. Studying mystical phenomena can be an entertaining pasttime, but it isn’t the pathway to investment profits. To reduce the element of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 203 chance to a minimum, one must deal with cause-and-e ffect relationships that are logical and understandable. It’s understandable, for example, that bull markets in gold tend to coincide roughly with periods of the rising inflati on. What makes that relationship understandable is its consistency with various things we know about the way people act: (1) that many people around the world have long-term holdings of U.S. dollars, (2) that people try to avoid losing wealth (to inflation or to anything el se, (3) that gold is the obvious alternative to U.S. dollars during peri ods when the U.S. dollar is losing value to inflation. But there’s no reason to accept such ideas (to use some old stock market wives’ tales) that July is a bullish month, or that the market’s result for January (or any other period) tells you how the whole year will turn out, or that a chart gap must be filled e ventually, or that the stock market will always do well in years ending in “5’s – until someone can explain, in terms of how the world work s, why any of this should be so. I’ve yet to see anyone do so. Advisory Records The performance records of advisors have to be eval uated with similar skepticism. If no advisor had a workable strategy, there still would be some advisors who stumbled into a decent record – even a few who compiled amazing track records. After all, there ar e hundreds (or thousands) of advisors. The size of the crowd favor s a few spectacular results – which you can be sure will be made known to you. But, unless you know why an advisor had been successful, you have no reason to believe he’ll continue to be successfu l. You have to look at his investment philosophy and decide whether it’ s compatible with the world as you know it. "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 204 There’s no guarantee your appraisal will be complet ely sound. But at least you’ll be comfortable with the reasoning and strategy of an advisor whose world-view is similar to yours. And i f your philosophy has brought you good things up to now, the chances are good that you’ll choose an advisor who will do right by you. In addition, having more than one advisor makes it easier to evaluate each of them – because they, in effect, critique ea ch other through their presentations of opposing viewpoints. CONCLUSION To sum up: 1. The fact that a particular indicator has “worked” s everal times in a row is no assurance – nor even a suggestion – that the indicator will work the next time. 2. The most common reason that a “reliable” indicator may fail to work just when you risk your money on it is that it never did really work. It was consistent with past results only in t hat, out of millions of potential indicators, chance allowed it to look good – for a while – in the same way that chance allowed a particular student out of 128 to be a champion coin-flipper. 3. When someone offers you an indicator, ask whether i ts track record comes equipped with a logical explanation. B y itself, a graph purporting to show a strict relationship betw een the indictor and a given result is nothing more than an interest ing picture. A graph of the lucky coin-flipper’s results would be equally as impressive. 4. If a plausible explanation shows why, in the world that you know, the indicator should lead to the promised result, y ou have something to consider using. "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 205 5. But even a plausible explanation doesn’t mean that the indicator will always work. Any economic relationship contain s many variables. Sometimes there are changes in the varia bles that we aren’t paying attention to. As a result, the plausi ble indicator may point up and the result may be down. (The indicator may still be useful – even if it’s now complicated by including more variables.) We’re always working with tentative theories about economics and investing – never a final natural law that will hol d up forever. 6. Realize that investment advisors love to discover s pecial indicators. Often, an indicator is unveiled or reca lled merely to support a view of the market to which the advisor i s already committed. In other cases, an indicator is employed to make economics and investing seem simpler than they real ly are. This doesn’t mean that all indicators are worthless , only that you have to look at more than past results. If the results p receded the indicator’s discovery, it may be that no one has actually profi ted from the indicator. Nor am I saying that all advisors are worthless, on ly that past records don’t guarantee what’s to come. Realize that there’s an element of chance in the ou tcome of every investment made. So an advisor’s record will result partly from luck – which may be good luck or bad luck. He may be bette r or worse than his record indicates. One of the things you want to evaluate in an adviso r is how he deals with the factor of luck and how he attempts to mini mize its influence. But whatever he does, luck will contribute to the r ecord he offers – and there’s an even chance that his luck will be di fferent tomorrow. Investing isn’t simple. Don’t believe that someone can reduce it to a simple indicator or a black-and-white track record. In investing, as in"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 206 anything else in life, you have to search for inves tments, indicators, and advisors that make sense to you. That’s far more important than touted track records or the apparent success of people who are making investments you’re not comfortable with. CODA I almost forgot. What about Mr. Jones? The next letter he received asked for $3,000. He pa id it and received a forecast saying that the market would go up. But th e market went down. He lost $4,000 on his futures contracts. Even after this loss, Mr. Jones was still $5,800 ah ead. He was ready, even anxious, to pay for another forecast. After al l, his mysterious forecaster had been right 7 times out of 8. But Mr. Jones never received another letter. On the day the forecast went awry, a Mr. Smith ente red into his computer the information that the market had gone d own that day.

It had started with 65,546 names a couple of months ago, but now there were only 92 names left. Pretty soon, the scheme would be over.

To them, the computer addressed envelopes which were stuffed wit h the “Send $500” letter. Surprisingly, 1,481 people responded by sending Mr. Smith $500 each. Of course, only half those people (740) then receiv ed correct forecasts. To those, he followed up with the “Send $1,000” letter. And 739 did so. (For the rest of his life, he wondered about the 740 th person.) Of these, 370 received the correct forecast, stayin g on the mailing list. After a “Send $2,000” letter and forecast, the list was down to 185 names. Mr. Jones was dropped from the list when his $3,000 forecast happened to be on the wrong side of the market. But, even then, there still were 92 winners. By the time the list had dwindled to 23 winners, Mr . Smith had amassed over $3 million.

He steers you around it, explaining, “I don’t want to walk under a ladder; the week ahead is going to be critical for the stoc k market.” You chuckle politely at his little joke. But when h e glares at you, you realize he’s serious. “The next week may be the cro ssroads,” he says sternly, “determining whether stocks continue up or slip into a bear market. I don’t want to take any chances.” You say to him, “You don’t really believe that the pattern of the clouds or your path around a ladder has anything to do with the market’s performance, do you?” “Yes I do.” “How can you? What do clouds have to do with stocks ? How does walking under a ladder influence the investment mar kets?” “I don’t know how these things work. But I can tell you this: I’ve b een in the investment business for 14 years, and I know that they do .” There’s no way to answer such an assertion. You can ’t investigate all the advisor’s encounters with ladders and cloud for mations over the last 14 years. But you don’t feel a need to.

I haven’t actually encountered much cloudophilia or ladderphobia, but the investment world is full of superstitions. One of the more popular superstitions is numerology – the belief that certain numbers or patterns of numbers have special significance. For example, an advisor who has been quoted frequently by newspaper wire services began a newsletter article in 1986 wi th: We forecast a new all-time high for gold in this cy cle, much higher than the 1980 high of $850. If you’re interested in gold, that opening would ce rtainly get your attention, and you’d want to know how he arrived at his opinion. Fortunately, he explains his reasons: In the early 1970s, gold rose from $35 to $180 (the orthodox Elliott Wave high). This was a factor of 5 (35 x 5 = 175), a Fibonacci number. From 1976 to 1980, gold advanced from $103 to $850, a Fibonacci factor of 8 (103 x 8 = 824). The price low of the 1 980-1985 bear market in gold was $285. The next number in the Fib onacci sequence is 13. If the current bull market in gold continue its Fibonacci relationship, then it could peak to 3705 (285 x 13) . I’ll explain Fibonacci numbers shortly, but for now please understand that the example isn’t hypothetical or even excepti onal. The superstitions I’ll discuss in this article touch pe rhaps 75% or more of all investment advisors. As a result, many investme nt strategies are founded on superstitions. IDEAS There are four types of ideas that you might act up on:"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 212 1. The Verifiable : You may not understand all the ins and outs of th e law of gravity, but you can verify its central thes is at any time just by dropping something and watching it fall to the g round. 2. The Reasonable : You haven’t actually tested the idea that you’ll drown if you stay too long under water. But it is c onsistent with what you know about water, life, and breathing – an d you can’t imagine a way for the idea not to be true. 3. The Authoritative : You’ve never checked personally to be sure that Africa is located where the atlas says it is, but y ou trust Rand- McNally’s version of the world – because you believ e they’ve verified the matter using standards you would consi der reasonable, and because you’ve never found them saying anything you know to be wrong. 4. The Superstitious : A superstition is a belief that hasn’t been verified (and perhaps can’t be verified) – for which no one has a reasonable explanation, for which you can’t even im agine what a reasonable explanation might be, and for which no a uthoritative source has claimed that there is a reasonable explanation. You don’t accept the idea that breaking a mirror br ings seven years’ bad luck, because nothing you know about life sugge sts any connection between mirrors and misfortune. In addit ion, there’s no body of authoritative opinion that accepts this ide a, and it’s doubtful that you’ll spend seven years trying to verify it. Superstition in Investing Since you and I aren’t superstitious, no one could convince us to worry over a broken mirror, or to act on the premis e that “things happen in threes,” or to pay attention to ladders o r black cats. But somehow we can be fooled into accepting more so phisticated superstitions by someone who leads us to believe th at a particular"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 213 investment rule has been verified, or explains it in a way that seems reasonable, or cloaks it in a mantel of authority. As I discussed in “Why Science Can’t Predict Invest ment Prices” in the last issue, economics and investing depend very little on principles that are verifiable – ideas that can be proven once and for all. Most of the economic principles you act on are acce pted because they seem reasonable to you or because you believe they’ ve been checked out or thought through by someone you consider to b e reasonable. Because economics deals with the decisions and acti ons of human beings, an idea is reasonable only if it’s consiste nt with what we know about the way human beings act. What electrons or p lanets do isn’t relevant. Economic event A can be expected to lead to economic event B only if you can imagine how the actions of human beings create a continuous thread leading from A to B. Selling Superstition Because the principles of economics and investing c an’t be proven once and for all, there’s a lot of room for pseudos cience and superstition. People who reject ideas about full mo ons and black cats readily accept superstitions pertaining to investme nts. There are three principal ways that investors are i nduced to accept superstitions that have no reasonable explanations. The first is with evidence that is incomplete. You’ re shown that event B followed event A four times in a row, but you are n’t shown the seven time event A wasn’t followed by event B. Or you aren’t shown the nine times that event B occurred without event A preceding it. Or it isn’t pointed out that events A and B are just t wo of a large group of events that seem to follow whenever event Q occurs. "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 214 The second is that the idea comes from a source you consider to be authoritative. You may respect the person who’s pro moting the idea because he is known to have an outstanding record, or because he once made a remarkable forecast that came to pass, or because his economic or political philosophy seems to be simila r to yours. Or you may simply be bowled over by his credentials – as a n economist, a scientist, or a famous person – or even by his conf ident manner. The third possibility is that the idea comes wrappe d in an authoritative package. It’s claimed that the idea has been tested extensively and verified beyond question. Or perhaps the promoter o f the idea dazzles you with mathematical and statistical techniques th at are useful in the physical sciences but have no place in economics. In other areas of life, one or more of these compon ents might not be enough to overcome anyone’s natural reserve and ske pticism. But ideas that promise to make investing easy or simple generally are welcomed because most investors want so much to bel ieve that they’re true. Investing isn’t easy work. It draws on judgment, no t science. There is no skill, no technique that can be relied upon to w ork unfailingly – no rules that provide consistent knowledge of the way a market is going to move. In order to find something they can count on, many investors are willing to set aside their skepticism, to give any idea the benefit of every doubt, to ignore the exceptions or logical fl aws that would scream at them if the subject were something other than investing. And so superstitions are born effortlessly and repe ated endlessly, and they have come to form a large part of the “common knowledge” of the investing world. Superstition Widespread "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 215 The practice of “technical analysis” is littered wi th superstition. For one example, some technicians believe that an inves tment price plotted on a graph that forms a pattern similar to a drooping flag is a prelude to a rally – even though there’s no reasona ble explanation for this belief and no rigorous attempt (that I know of ) has ever been made to test the idea. Superstition isn’t confined to technicians, however . In fact, it pervades the investment world. Investors and advisors rely o n trading systems, on supposedly fixed economic relationships, and on legends about how investment prices move – all without demanding an explanation of why they should be true, and usually without any serious attempt to determine whether his story has refuted them. The common explanation is, “I don’t know why it works this way, but it always does.” But that’s not much of an explanation. Even a witch doctor who forecasts the future by throwing chicken bones on t he ground could argue, “I don’t know why it works, but it always ha s.” Every cult of magic, no matter how outlandish, has adherents who swear that it always works. In most cases, the technique actually works only in frequently. However, when a person joins a cult, although he ma y not learn to see the future, he usually learns how to explain away t he lapses between theory and practice. Even if you see that an idea has worked on one or more occasions, the lack of a reasonable explanation makes the idea unr eliable. Someone watching a child flipping a coin that comes up head s several times in a row might believe there was a natural law involved and say, “I don’t know why it works, but it does work.” Any cause-and-effect relationship must be explained in terms of what we know about how human beings act. You should rema in"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 216 unconvinced until someone explains how the actions of one person lead to the actions of another, to another and anot her, until you arrive at the effect that’s supposed to flow from the orig inal cause. Without such an explanation, the odds are very grea t that the evidence for the relationship is contrived or is the result of coincidence. Realism vs. Superstition Studying coincidences can be entertaining, but it i sn’t the highway to investment profits – any more than studying rabbits ’ feet is the key to avoiding accidents. It’s more productive to examine common rules of inv esting to see whether they’re consistent with what you know about the way human beings act. It’s a common belief, for example, that gold is an inflation hedge. The idea that bull markets in gold tend to coincide rou ghly with periods of rising inflation is understandable because it’s consistent with what w e know about the way people act: (1) that many people around the world hold U.S. dollars as a store of wealth; (2) t hat people try to avoid losing wealth (to inflation or to anything el se); (3) that gold – because it’s liquid, portable, divisible, readily i dentifiable, private, and stable in supply – is a ready alternative to U. S. dollars as a store of value; and (4) that during periods when the U.S. dollar is losing value to inflation, gold’s usefulness as a store of value increases. Even if someone should refute the relationship even tually, it wouldn’t mean that it had been unreasonable to accept it. On the other hand, it is mere superstition to belie ve, as many people do, that gold prices foretell the future of inflation; or that the scope of the next bull market in gold can be foreseen by mea suring the last bull market; or that gold stocks are a leading indicator of gold bullion. "},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 217 No one can explain why people in the gold market sh ould behave in such a way as to make these things happen, no conce ivable explanations seem possible, and none of these ideas could stand the test of history. They are just superstitions that h appen to be widely accepted. Nor is there any reason to accept stock market supe rstitions such as “July is a bullish month” or “A chart gap must be f illed eventually” or “The market always does well in years ending in 5” – until someone can explain, in terms of how the world works, why a ny of this should be so. I haven’t seen anyone even try. FIBONACCI NUMBERS A few superstitions have the loyalty of occult-mind ed investors but are too bizarre for the average investor or advisor to swallow. And yet once you stop demanding reasonable explanat ions for investment rules, you become fair game for just abo ut anything anyone might dream up. You could, for example, find yourself entranced by Fibonacci numbers – and you’d have plenty of company. Many in vestors and advisors believe that mathematics can unlock the se crets of the financial universe – and that Fibonacci numbers are the key. 4 Leonardo Fibonacci (1170-1230) was an Italian mathe matician who devised a numerical sequence that begins with 1 and 1, which are the “seeds” of the sequence. These are added together t o make 2, which is the third number. Then 1 and 2 are added to make 3; 2 and 3 to make 5; 3 and 5 to make 8; and so on. Thus the sequence runs: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and on and on – with ea ch number after the seeds equal to the sum of the two numbers immediate ly preceding it.   4 I discussed Fibonacci numbers in the newsletter a c ouple of times last year. Please forgive me for repeating some of that here, as the example is too appropriate not to include it in thi s article."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 218 Modern witch doctors believe that Fibonacci numbers have a special status in nature and in the financial world – and t hey expect these numbers to show up at strategic places in an invest ment’s future. In the example on page 104-11, the advisor saw (or tho ught he saw) 5 and 8, and concluded that 13 must be coming next – two Fibonacci numbers pointing to a third. Fibonacci buffs offer no cause-and-effect explanati on (that I’ve seen) for the significance of Fibonacci numbers. Instead they “verify” its significance by collecting examples of Fibonacci nu mbers in the investment world – such as an uptrend lasting 8 mon ths. Of course, it would be amazing if there weren’t plenty of examples – since half the numbers between 1 and 10 are Fibonacci numbers. Adherents also are awed by the fact that the result of dividing any Fibonacci number (after the first few) by its prede cessor is approximately 1.618 (55 divided by 34 = 1.618, 144 divided 89 = 1.618, and so on). If there were nothing special ab out Fibonacci numbers, why is there a consistent relationship bet ween every pair of numbers? The number 1.618 is called the Golden Ratio or the Golden Mean. This number and its reciprocal .618 have special si gnificance in the Fibonacci scheme of things. An uptrend might be exp ected to stop at 1.618 times its starting price, or a downtrend migh t be expected to halt at .618 times the price at which it began. Some writers have composed rhapsodies about the fre quency with which the Golden Mean shows up in life. A rectangle whose length is 1.618 times its width is said to be the proportion most pleasing to the eye, and so that shape is found in paintings, playi ng cards, windows, doors, publications (but not this publication), and many other things. 5   5 However, if you walk around your home with a tape m easure, you might not find a single example of the Golden Ratio. Of c ourse, your house may have been poorly designed."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 219 Fibomania Fibonacci fans say that mathematics can be used to project the past and present into the future – if only you know the right multiplier or have the correct sequence of numbers. And it’s true that there is something fascinating a bout the symmetry of the Fibonacci series and the tidy way in which e ach number is about 1.618 times the size of its predecessor. Once it’s been called to your attention, it’s easy to start seeing Fibonacci numbers under every bed. Somehow the world seems full of numbers like 3 , 5, 8, 1.618, and 618. Life itself seems to testify to the significance of Fibonacci numbers. And what could be more authoritative than mathemati cs? But hold off before you enter limit orders to sell all your investments at 1.618 times their recent lows. What we’ve seen o f Fibonacci numbers so far is true, but incomplete. The attribu tes of the Fibonacci series are remarkable, but far from unique. Mathema tics is full of curious consistencies. Bean Math For example, let me tell you about the famous Itali an mathematician Gabrielo Garbanzo (? - ?). His series runs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 2 30, 423, 778, 1431, and so on. It’s similar to the Fibonacci series, bu t each number after 2 is the sum of the preceding three numbers in the series (6= 1+2+3, 11 = 2+3+6, 20=3+6+11, and so forth). After the series gets going, divide any number by i ts predecessor and – lo and behold – the answer is 1.839. We can call this constant the Golden Bean. I’m sure that, once we start looking, we’ll find plenty of"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 220 Garbanzo numbers and Garbanzo Beans in the investme nt markets – such as an investment trend that lasted 1, 2, 3, 6, or 11 months, and ended somewhere near 1.8 times the price at which i t started. In fact, any series will produce many golden ratios. In the Garbanzo series, after 125, each number is 3.4 times the num ber that’s two steps before it, and so on indefinitely. The Proof of the Pasta Another mathematical genius, Enrico Fettucini (? - ?), created a series made up of the squares of numbers: 1 (1x1), 4 (2x2), 9 (3x3), 16 (you get the idea), 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, and so on. This is the famous Fettucini Series. Some years later, his son, Alfredo, used the differ ences between each pair of adjoining numbers in the series to create a second series: 3 (4 minus 1), 5 (9-4), 7 (16-9), 9 (got it?), 11, 13, 1 5, 17, 19, and so on. What do you know? Each number is 2 greater than its predecessor. This is the famous Fettucini Alfredo Series. Fun with Numbers Mathematics is full of surprising consistencies, sy mmetries, and other curiosities. There are entertaining books full of o ddities and games played with numbers. And there are numbers that see m to show up wherever you look. The number 2 is the basis of almost all music phras eology in western civilization. Musical phrases, fragments, songs, an d sections fit into standard lengths of 2 bars, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 bar s – all powers of 2. When a phrase is any other length – 3 bar or 5 bars , for example – it sounds lopsided. "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 221 Literature is brimming with the number 3. You never read a story about someone posing 4 riddles or 7 riddles; it’s a lways 3. The hero never has to face 2 tests or 5 tests; it’s always 3 . The trinity appears throughout literature – not just in Christian theol ogy. Because we use the decimal system, the number 10 ap pears especially significant. We think of the numbers 10, 20, 800, 3 000, for example, as being round – while 64 or 89, although not jagge d, just aren’t round. And numbers ending in 5 are usually consider ed round because they add up so easily in decimal arithmetic. But in octal arithmetic (a counting system that uses a base of 8 rather than a base of 10), 64 is as round as 100 is in decimal arithmetic. Almost any number has its own claim to significance . There’s 1 (unity), 2 (as in music), 3 (as in literature), 4 ( seasons), 5 (round number), 6 (Satan’s number), 8 (music again), 9 (3 squared), and 10 (there’s nothing rounder). The only number between 1 and 10 without special significance seems to be 7 – and you know w hat it means. Fibonacci numbers have no special claim to being na ture’s darlings – and certainly are of no importance in the investmen t markets. USE OF SUPERSTITION If I’ve labored the matter of Fibonacci numbers too long, please forgive me – but there’s an important point here. Y ou can’t identify the likely highs or lows of an investment trend by playing with numbers. In addition, the Fibonacci enthusiasm points up how easily an investor with a limited knowledge of mathematics can be dazz led by numerical fireworks that seem to be proving something. You might assume that bizarre subjects like Fibonac ci numbers are of no particular importance, and that only the less-th an-serious investor"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 222 would give them the time of day. But that isn’t the case. Many advisors set their watches by Fibonacci numbers. Many of the investment forecasts you’ve ready may h ave been constructed using Fibonacci numbers – even though t he forecasters didn’t bother to tell you that. And Fibonacciphilia is only one superstition that guides investment advisors. I know many advisors personally, and I know many mo re through reading their works. While I haven’t made a methodi cal study of the popularity of superstitions, I estimate that: ♦ About 2% of investment advisors use astrology in th eir work; ♦ At least 15% of all advisors pay attention to Fibon acci numbers, with the figure closer to 50% among people in the f utures and commodity markets; ♦ At least 35% believe that history repeats itself as if reading from a script – and so they study such things as 21-day cy cles, 5-month cycles, 4-year cycles, the 54 Kondratieff Wave cycl e, or Elliott Waves; ♦ Perhaps 75% adhere to one or more rules of technica l analysis that have neither reasonable explanations nor verified r ecords of predictive powers. These practitioners aren’t found only on the fringe s of the advisory business. Some of the best-known advisors take Fibo nacci numbers seriously. And many well-known advisors act on rule s of technical analysis that have no more foundation than the famo us natural law, “Things always happen in threes.” Math "},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 223 The fascination with Fibonacci numbers is part of s omething more wide-ranging and more dangerous – the widespread be lief that economic questions can be answered by playing with numbers. Most investment advisors believe that a great deal can be discovered by multiplying, adding, or dividing something with something else – even though there are no principles in economics th at can be applied by mathematical calculation. Attaching significance to certain numbers because t hey happen to be in the Fibonacci series may seem ridiculous to you. But the next time you draw a trendline on a chart, ask yourself why y ou’re doing it. A trendline is nothing more than an attempt to use tw o significant numbers to create a series of other significant num bers. Mathematics doesn’t have the mysterious powers hope d for by investors and advisors who read buy and sell signal s in the moving averages of an investment price; or who measure the lengths and heights of previous bull markets to foresee the sco pe of the next bull market; or who try to discover next year’s inflatio n rate by projecting the patterns of past inflationary periods. Because mathematics is so important in the physical sciences, its significance for economics may seem self-evident. A s a result, very few investment advisors even question whether mathe matics is an appropriate tool in the many cases in which they us e it. The only legitimate meeting of economics and mathem atical calculation is in the area of statistics. We use arithmetic to add up quantities of wheat or total the money supply, to calculate gains and losses in investment s, to compute yields from prices, to determine indices of market prices, to compute rates of growth. These uses are purely descriptive; the answ ers they give will be the same no matter what human beings may decide to do in the future."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 224 But it’s a misuse of mathematics to apply it to que stions that will be answered in the future by the actions of human bein gs. No mathematical formula can tell you how much consumer s or investors will value something in the future – or even in the present. Rules that purport to use mathematics in this way h ave no credentials; they are pure superstition. SUPERSTITION Investment markets aren’t moved by ratios, divisors , numerical series, cubes, or lines drawn on graphs – nor are they move d by chicken bones. They’re moved by human beings buying and sel ling in accordance with their own private hopes, concerns, beliefs, and aspirations – values that change constantly and all ow no measurement. There is no way to verify absolutely the worth of a ny trading system, indicator, or investment rule.

So it’s imperative that you apply the test of reaso n to any method of trading system, method of investment analysis, or r ule you consider.

Here are 10 popular questions investors ask — each of which clouds the issue, rather than clarifies it — together with questions that will solicit the information you really need to know. RISK 2. “Is there any risk?” Of course there is risk. No investment is risk-fre e. Risk is simply the possibility that the investment won’t do as well as expected. What you want to know is: • In what economic circumstances is the investment’s price likely to go down? • Are other investments in your portfolio likely to t ake up the slack by gaining in those circumstances? • What is the most you can lose on the investment? ( Usually every penny you put it into it.) SAFETY 3. “Is this investment safe?” What does safe mean? That the price can’t go down? Bank accounts don’t fall in price so long as the bank stays in business. But they can l ose real value during inflationary periods."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 227 No investment is perfectly safe. There isn’t a sin gle one that can’t lose value in some scenario. What you want to know is: • Under what circumstances would I lose a substantial share — 20% or more — of my investment? • Under what circumstances would my entire investment be lost? • Do I have any residual liability — that is, can I l ose more than my cash investment? INCOME & CAPITAL APPRECIATION 4. “What is the investment’s yield?” Interest and dividends (an investment’s yield) are two of the three ways you can gain from an investment. The third wa y is through price appreciation. All three give you money you can spend. But the fi rst two ways are immediately taxable, while the third might not be t axable for many years. Looking for the highest yield leads to two kinds of trouble. First, interest rates generally reflect an investme nt’s risk. A higher interest rate means there’s a greater possibility t he capital can be lost — through default or inflation. And a high di vidend yield often means an investment isn’t likely to appreciate in p rice — and may even mean the company is paying some of its capital in dividends. Second, chasing yields can cause you to overlook ot her factors — and may even cause you to consume capital, rather than preserve it. Suppose, for example, that in 1970 you had put your capital into long- term Treasury bonds yielding 6%, with the thought t hat you would"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 228 live on the income and preserve the capital. Consum er prices doubled during the 1970s, cutting the purchasing power of t he bond interest — and your standard of living — in half. In addition, inflation caused current interest rate s to rise, so that bond prices steadily depreciated. Your capital was slipp ing away from you. Even if you held the bond to maturity, you got back dollars of much smaller value than those you had invested. You may have thought you were “living off the incom e, not the capital,” but by 1980 your capital had been cut by 20% in dollar value and 60% in actual purchasing power. And the income was buying only half the living standard expected of it. Yield, by itself, is only a half-truth about the in vestment. What you also need to know is: • Under what circumstances, if any, is the investment likely to appreciate? • Under what circumstances, if any, is the investment likely to depreciate? • In good circumstances for the investment, will the overall return — yield plus capital appreciation — help you r portfolio? If the investment is a mutual fund, you want the fu nd with the lowest yield — other things being equal. Any dividend pai d by a mutual fund simply reduces the price of the fund by a comp arable amount — so that the dividend is coming out of your own pock et. And even though you gain nothing from the dividend, it adds to the current year’s taxable income — causing you to pay taxes on a phantom profit. TRACK RECORD 5. “How well did this investment perform in recent years?” "},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 229 You may get tired of hearing it, but we do have to remind ourselves that past performance is no guide to future success . Investments have their ups and downs. And if you buy an investment after a few up years, you may be jumping in just before it’s ready for a few down years. This is true as well of mutual funds, market timers , and other advisors. What you need to know is: • What kind of economic climate should cause this inv estment to prosper? • When that climate has existed, did the investment prosper? • If this investment is for a balanced portfolio, wil l buying it give you too many investments dependent on that one kind of climate — making you too vulnerable to some othe r economic climate? • If this is a speculation, do you think we’re headin g into the economic climate that favors this item? SPONSORS 6. “Who thinks this investment is about to rise?” No one — not even the most astute investment adviso r you can think of — knows how the investment will do next year. Every advisor has about an even chance of being rig ht when forecasting whether a particular investment is head ed upward or downward. It doesn’t matter how good his record has been for picking stocks, timing the market, or spotting next year’s winners. Never forget my first rule of investment advice: The advisor with the perfect record will lose his t ouch when you start acting on his advice."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 230 It does little good to know who is recommending an investment. The important questions are: • Why is he recommending the investment? Do his argumen ts make sense? • What does he believe it will add to your portfolio? • What will have to happen for his forecast to come t rue? • Do you want to bet on that event with funds you can afford to lose? TAKING THE PLUNGE 7. “How much should I invest?” No one can tell you how much to invest in an item b ecause no one is in your circumstances. If this investment is to contribute to a balanced p ortfolio, ask yourself: • How much of the investment do I need to provide the proper balance against other investments in the portfolio? • How big an investment would make me too vulnerable to some potential event? If the item is being considered as a speculation, a sk yourself: • Since the entire investment could be lost,  how much can you afford that investment to be? “SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE” INVESTING 8. If a company or a mutual fund, “Is it socially r esponsible?” The stock exchange isn’t a pulpit. If you want to promote a particular environmental policy, political philosophy, or pers onal enthusiasm, do it with the profits you make from hard-headed inves ting. "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 231 Maximizing profits and conforming to social policie s are separate endeavors. You can cater to one endeavor only at t he expense of the other. So it makes sense to focus on sound investi ng, and then — if you want — use the profits to indulge your politica l beliefs. The management’s policy is important in some cases. For example, if you buy a mutual fund to add to a Permanent Portfol io’s balance, you’re counting on the fund to perform in a certain way in various economic climates. You want to know that the inves tment will be just as appropriate next year as it is today. So ask: • Is the management’s policy a consistent one that yo u can count on — engraved in the prospectus? TAKEOVER CANDIDATE 9. “Is this company a potential takeover candidate? ” (or does it have some other fashionable characteristic?) There is no information you can obtain about a comp any that isn’t available to everyone else in the marketplace. Thu s whatever is attractive about the company probably is already re flected in its price. If the company does what is expected, the price mig ht go up a bit — as what is probable is transformed into fact. But if the expected event fails to materialize, the price may drop a long way — as the unexpected catches everyone by surprise. So when y ou act on the expectation of a takeover (or some other hope), you are risking a lot to gain a little — exactly opposite to what a speculat ion should be. So don’t ask or hope for significant information. Ask yourself instead: • Do you interpret the widely known information in a different way from what most people believe? Large speculative profits are earned only when you go against the crowd. The crowd isn’t always wrong, but you can’t make much betting with it — because you will buy at a price t hat’s already high."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 232 By going against the crowd, you buy when an investm ent is out of favor and cheap; if it does succeed, there’s a long way for it to go up. So the most important factor in speculating is whet her you expect something that most people don’t expect. The time to consider buying inflation hedges speculatively is when most people believe inflation is under control. The time to consider buying a parti cular company is when everyone knows what a dog it is — not when eve ryone talks about its great promise. Unpopularity isn’t a guarantee of profits, but it’s a prerequisite. POPULARITY 10. “If this investment is so good, why don’t I see it recommended in newsletters or Money magazine?” As discussed in the last answer, unpopularity is a essential to a speculation. So you can’t expect to make big profi ts without feeling a little lonely. If the investment is being considered for your Perm anent Portfolio, you have to decide whether it adds to the portfolio ’s safety — while the recommendations you see in newsletters and maga zines almost never will consider what your portfolio needs. If someone discusses the investment you’re consider ing, ask: • Is the advisor helping you decide whether the inves tment is right for you, or is he simply guessing whether the investment will go up in price? If the latter, ignore the advice. If the former, a nd his information seems sound, take it into account when making your decision. "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 233 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 11. “Do the technical factors favor the investment now?” That question really is a proxy for about 2,487 que stions: Are the moving averages rising? Is investor sentiment bull ish? Is that a head- and-shoulders formation I spy on the chart? Is its tail between its legs? And so on. No matter how many times a given indicator has sign aled correctly in the past, it has only an even chance of being right this time — just as you have an even chance to flip a coin heads, no ma tter how many heads or tails have come up already. Instead, ask yourself: • Is there something on TV that’s more interesting th an these charts? SUMMARY Always define carefully what you are trying to achi eve. You must have an investment plan. Without a plan, you will be tossed and turned by al l the conflicting ideas you read and hear — and you’ll never ask the right questions. With a plan, you’ll have a basis for evaluating wha tever you hear. You’ll know to ask the questions that help you dete rmine whether the investment furthers your plan."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 234 THE 16 GOLDEN RULES OF FINANCIAL SAFETY July 23, 1997 Over and over we read of a famous person who made a great sum of money as an entertainer, sports star, or business g enius — only to lose it all. Sometimes the individual lost his money because of poor investment decisions or because he became involved in a busine ss for which he had no aptitude or experience. Other times it's bec ause a money manager had too much control of the money and too l ittle monitoring. Or a would-be tax expert set up a complicated tax-s helter scheme that didn't work and brought on heavy penalties. Every time I read one of these stories, I'm struck by the tragedy. Someone has lost everything and is unlikely to reco ver it because his big-income days are past. And I'm struck by how senseless the tragedy is. The individual had so little to gain from the unnecessary risks he took, and so little chance to succeed with them. Pay No Attention to the Rich & Famous When you read that one of the richest people in the world — someone like Bunker Hunt or Donald Trump — has declared ban kruptcy or is in financial trouble, it's easy to feel a sense of futility about managing your own money. If such a person — able to afford t he best financial advice in the world — can’t hang onto his money, wh at chance do you have? But the wealthy individual didn't fail because he r eceived a bad forecast about the future, lacked access to the rig ht kind of"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 235 information, or picked a poor investment. His undoi ng was in violating some basic rule of financial safety. Had he followed the simple, common-sense rules of investing, his wealth would still be his. And the rules by which he is bound, and which he vi olated, are the same principles that apply to your finances. If you abide by those rules, there's less than one chance in a million th at you could lose all you have. I call these common-sense principles the 16 Golden Rules of Financial Safety. 1. Your career provides your wealth. You most likely will make far more money from your business or profession tha n from your investments. So don’t take risks with complicated i nvestment schemes in the hope of multiplying your capital qui ckly. You’re risking a lot to gain a little. 2. Don’t assume you can replace your wealth. The fact that you earned what you have doesn’t mean you could do it a gain. Markets change, laws change. And, as time passes, increasin g regulation makes it harder and harder to earn a fortune. So tr eat what you have as though you could never earn it again. 3. Don’t use leverage. When people go broke, it’s almost always because they were operating with borrowed money — e ven though they may already have been quite rich. If you handl e all your business and investment affairs on a cash basis, th ere’s practically no chance you could lose everything – no matter wha t might happen in the world. 4. No one can predict the future. Events in the investment markets result from the decisions of millions of different people. And those events never unfold as expected. Investor advisors have no more ability to predict the future actions of human bein gs than psychics and fortune-tellers do. 5. No one can move you into and out of investments con sistently with precise and profitable timing. You'll hear about many Wall"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 236 Street wizards, but the investment advisor with the perfect record up to now most likely will lose his touch the momen t you start acting on his advice. 6. No trading system will work as well in the future a s it did in the past. You'll come across trading systems or indicators t hat seem over and over to have signaled correctly where an investor's money should have been, but you can assume the syst ems will stop working when your money is on the line. 7. Recognize the difference between investing and spec ulating. When you invest, you accept the return the markets are paying investors in general. When you speculate, you attem pt to beat that return — to do better than other investors are doin g — through astute timing, forecasting, or stock selection, and with the implied belief that you're smarter than a mere investor. Th ere's nothing wrong with speculating — provided you do it with mo ney you can afford to lose. But the money that's precious to yo u shouldn't be risked on a bet that you can outperform other inves tors. 8. Don’t let anyone make your decisions. You don’t need a money manager and, above all, never give anyone signature authority over money that’s precious to you. You have no way of knowing what he may be prompted to do someday by pressures or problems. 9. Don’t ever do anything you don’t understand. It doesn’t matter that your favorite investment advisor, your best fr iend, or your brother-in-law understands something. It isn’t his money at risk. It’s better to leave your money in Treasury bills t han to take the chance that someday you’ll discover there were risk s or liabilities you couldn’t see at the outset. 10. Keep some assets outside the country in which you l ive. Don’t allow everything you own to be within the reach of your government. You’ll be less vulnerable, and you’ll f eel less vulnerable — and you won’t have to worry so much ab out what the government will do next. 11. Beware of tax-avoidance schemes. Tax rates are still low enough in the U.S. that you might gain very little from th e risk and effort of constructing elaborate tax shelters. Complicated tax schemes"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 237 may include many vulnerabilities and liabilities of which you’re not aware. 12. Don’t depend on any one investment, institution, or person for your safety. Every investment has its bad periods: the inflatio n of the 1970s hurt stocks, bonds, and even Treasury bil ls — while the 1980s were terrible for gold. Real estate lost its luster when the tax rules changed in 1986. And as we’ve seen, you can’t count on institutions either — as banks, savings & loans, an d pension funds have gone under. 13. Create a balanced portfolio for protection. For the money you need to take care of you for the rest of your life, set up a simple, balanced, diversified portfolio (what I call a Perm anent Portfolio). Design the portfolio to assure that your wealth wil l survive any event, including events that would be devastating t o one or more of the portfolio’s investments. This needn’t be com plicated; you can achieve a great deal of diversification with a surprisingly simple portfolio. 14. Speculate only with money you can afford to lose. If you believe it’s possible to beat the market, set up a separate pool of money (what I call a Variable Portfolio) with which you can speculate to your heart’s content. But make sure th is pool contains no more money than you can afford to lose. 15. Enjoy yourself with a budget for pleasure. To enjoy your wealth, allow a budgeted amount that you can spend each year without concern for the consequences. If you stay w ithin the budgeted amount, you can blow this money on cars, t rips, anything you want — knowing that you aren’t blowing your fut ure. 16. Whenever you’re in doubt about a course of acti on, it is always better to err on the side of safety. If you pass up an opportunity to increase your fortune, there alw ays will be another chance. But if you lose your life savin gs, you might not get a chance to replace them. "},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 238 UNDERSTANDING INVESTMENT SUCCESS January 14, 1987 Last year, I published articles on the two principa l schools of investment analysis – fundamental analysis and tech nical analysis. The articles concluded that each school has as many flaws as virtues. In addition, I’ve said over and over that consisten t success at forecasting is impossible; that the track record of an investment advisor should be taken with a grain of salt; that economic science has no formulas by which to calculate the future; and t hat a great deal of investment advice is based upon superstition. Actually, that’s the good news – because it helps to explain why so few things in the investment world work out the way they’re expected to. And there’s even more good news. There are successful investors and speculators. And there are advisors who provide val uable services to their clients – services that help the clients make and keep profits. I believe it’s possible for you to succeed as an in vestor – or else I wouldn’t write this newsletter. But I think it’s im portant to understand what kind of success is possible and what kind may be out of reach. A great deal of investment capital has been lost by investors who misunderstand the success they see others achieving . So this article will examine the elements that make a speculator su ccessful – to show why simply imitating him won’t work. We’ll begin by looking at the wide range of talents and personalities among investment advisors."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 239 THE GAMUT OF ADVISORS There’s no lack of variety in the advisors who popu late the investment business. Many advisors and writers are reasonable and helpfu l; a few are even wise. Others are chronically wrong in their informa tion, in their logic, and in the recommendations they make. There are noisy advisors who have little to offer b ut flamboyance and showmanship – although you’d never know that from h earing them describe themselves. Some advisors are just plain dangerous. Their ideas , systems, and strategies could cost you dearly because they give no thought to the risks attached to their recommendations. They are r elay stations for rumor and misinformation. They stir your anxiety ab out real or imagined threats to the world. Their explanations a re sloppy, and their suggestions sometimes are deliberately ambiguous. There also are advisors whose hearts are in the rig ht place but whose judgments usually land elsewhere. They seem to have a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Fortuna tely, some of them have other virtues; they may be good educators or h elpful in supplying information. Most advisors are neither saints nor great sinners. Some have particular strengths – as educators, informants, ta cticians, entertainers, even tranquilizers. And each has his own weaknesses . The Winners Our concern here is with advisors who, from time to time, show flashes of genius. They sometimes have thoughts abo ut the market that are truly perceptive, original, and profitable . "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 240 They aren’t always right. But sometimes they’re spe ctacularly right – calling attention to possibilities that others have overlooked. Generally, these advisors don’t concern themselves with strategy or detail. Their primary concern is where the markets are headed. And in that regard they seem to have more hot streaks than other advisors. But in a number of puzzling cases, if you look clos ely at these people, it’s hard to believe they could be successful at an ything. Let me tell you about four of them. Mr. Mystic The first advisor seems to be two different persona lities. One side of him preaches and practices a kind of my sticism that explains the workings of the world by reference to one of the superstitious cycle-wave theories that make the rou nds. In this persona, the advisor’s comments and explanations ar e worthless. But sometimes he sets aside his charts and magic sp ectacles, and speaks in English. When he does, he offers valuable and perceptive insights into the markets – and even into the non-i nvestment world. At such times his ideas are worth hearing. The record of his specific investment recommendatio ns, while not outstanding, is above average – good enough that I’ m willing to believe he has a feel for the way markets move. Mr. Unappreciated The second advisor might be described charitably as a manic- depressive, paranoid schizophrenic. He is bitter, l onely, crying out for attention and recognition – the kind of person you’ d like to have living next door. "},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 241 And yet sometimes he comes up with spectacular fore casts that are both unusual and successful. He often sees things t hat others miss. And occasionally he has a hot streak in investment recommendations that runs for a year or more. Of course, he’s made the normal share of wrong gues ses – which means quite a few. And some of those wrong guess ha ve been costly for his customers. You could never be safe relying blindly on his recommendations. But if you can look beyond his sel f-pity, you often find good ideas lurking among his sniffles. Mr. Occult A third advisor loves to dabble in the occult. In h is newsletter, he often plays with Fibonacci numbers and other mystic isms. But when it comes time to make a decision – to buy or sell - he forgoes the pleasure of witchcraft and relies mainl y on his sense of the market. That sense has been remarkably right someti mes, and rarely very far wrong. Mr. Other-World The fourth advisor is so disconnected from the real world that he actually invited his newsletter subscribers to send him their personal experiences with changing retail prices – which he intended to use as data for a consumer price index he believed would b e more accurate than the one compiled by the government. 1 Despite this kind of thinking, he managed to produc e the best performance record for 1985 of the advisors monitor ed by The Hulbert Financial Digest . Strange Winners   1 Maybe his circulation is larger than the government ’s."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 242 For his faults, none of these advisors sounds very promising. But somehow each of them has earned a place in the uppe r ranks of the advisory business. How could this be? How could people with such silly ideas or troubled personalities do so well? Is there no justice in the world? One possibility is luck, of course. But I’ve watche d three of these advisors over a number of years. And each of them i s pretty consistently right – or at least perceptive – in ce rtain areas, while often wrong in others. Luck wouldn’t be so discrimi nating. And in the areas in which they’re generally right, their statements usually are reasonable. This leads me to believe th at each one has a special aptitude in a certain area. Unfortunately, the advisors aren’t satisfied to acc ept their abilities for what they are and concentrate on them. Instead, the y roam into areas where their talents aren’t as great, or they attrib ute their success to ideas an intelligent person can’t accept. To understand the nature of their success, and to c onsider the possibility that you might be as successful, we nee d to examine the roles of talent and intuition – which are elements of success in any field."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 243 TALENT In every area of life, we recognize the importance of talent. We know there are musicians, athletes, comics, writ ers, artists, architects, actors, and orators whose abilities go far beyond what they’ve learned from schooling or experience. And this is true not only in glamorous occupations; we see the special brilliance that some people have as cooks, flower a rrangers, woodworkers, mechanics, hairdressers. You undoubted ly know people who have unusually good memories, or who are “good with their hands,” or who have unusual abilities to draw pictures or add large numbers in their heads. In all these cases, the special ingredient that set s the person apart is a talent for a particular task – a talent he “comes by natu rally.” Mindful of the importance of talent, you wouldn’t e xpect to become a celebrated pianist just by reading a book by Libera ce. In fact, you know that even ten years of study with Liberace mig ht not turn you into a professional pianist – or even a very good a mateur. The crucial question is whether you have a talent for music in general and for the piano in particular. Talent is a factor in any job, craft, art, or hobby . You probably could learn to type 50 words a minute, but – no matter how smart you are or how long you practice – you mi ght never match the talented typist who turns out 100 words a minut e. Whatever talent you have for something, training ca n make it more effective. But it won’t increase your talent or giv e you more potential than your talent will allow. "},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 244 No one doubts this when the subject is music or ath letics. When the subject is investing, the point is less obvious – b ut no less true. Talent for Investing Talent is just as important in the investment world . There are people who were born to be speculators, a nd speculators who wish they’d never been born. Many writers or advisors tempt you with the idea th at you could become a great speculator, another Bernard Baruch, a millionaire many times over – if you’d just follow the rules pr acticed by the great. It’s a wonderful idea. But, unfortunately, it doesn ’t make sense. Would you expect to make it to the stage of the Met ropolitan Opera just by reading a book called Luciano’s Favorite Singing Tricks ? Would you expect to become an inventive genius like Thomas Edison just by watching an old Mickey Rooney movie? Why should it be plausible, or even possible, that you (as well as millions of other investors) could become a stock-m arket whiz by learning the tricks of a recognized genius? As I’ll discuss later in the article, many elements of investing can be learned and put to use profitably without any speci al talent. But beyond these techniques is an art that can’t be tau ght or captured in a list of rules. An art requires a talent that no effort or educatio n can produce. Some people study painting for years but never paint any thing you’d want to look at. Others fill their school days with math co urses but are never really at home with algebra. And many people learn all they can about investing but always seem to buy the wrong things. "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 245 Apart from those who have simply been lucky, the pe ople who achieve spectacular investment success do so becaus e they have a talent for investing. Some of these winners are unr ealistic, unattractive, even unintelligent people – but they have a talent for sensing the movements of markets. Talent isn’t everything. Because of other factors, some talented people are more successful than others. And the lack of a natural talent for investing doesn’t leave you helpless. But any plans you may have to become a star investo r or speculator are empty if they disregard the part that natural t alent plays. INTUITION Not only is it impossible to copy the tricks of som eone whose talents are different from yours, it’s difficult even to id entify what those tricks are. Very few geniuses can explain their gifts. This is because so little of what they do operates solely on explicit, step-by-s tep reasoning. This, of course, is true for most of what anyone does. For example, when you drive a car, you don’t say to yourself, “N ow I’ll turn the wheel slightly to the left . . . now I’ll turn it s lightly to the right . . . now I should shift gears.” Nor do you explain to yo urself why you’re doing these things. You act automatically because your mind is taking i n and processing information about the road, the traffic, and the sp eed and direction of your car – all without your having to make consciou s decisions. In fact, if a passenger asked why you did a particular thing, you might find it difficult to explain. You might not even ha ve noticed doing it. "},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 246 You weren’t paying attention when you acted, you ma de the decision unconsciously, and so it’s very difficult to identi fy the reasons for what you did. When you make decisions without noticing the step-b y-step process, you’re using intuition – which is the unconscious processing of information and ideas. There’s nothing mystical about intuition. It isn’t a strange gift for divining the future or reading minds. It’s simply a facility, that everyone has, to make a judgment – right or wrong – without paying attention to how the judgment is made. When intuition operates, you analyze information and ideas without noticing the process until the answer comes to the surface of your mind. With intuition, you size up a stranger as honest or dishonest, or judge whether a house is one you’d be happy living in – w ithout being able to identify all the factors that influenced your de cision. Most everyday activity runs on intuition – eating, walking, writing, talking, most physical labor and a great deal of me ntal labor. You don’t ponder each step, you decide and move before you realize what you’ve done. 2 Intuition in Investing A speculator acts intuitively, too.   2 Habit also is involved in many activities. But habi t and intuition aren’t the same thing. Intuition is a part of your intellect – a way by which you form judgments and opinions about what is true or what to do in a particular situation. Habit, on the other h and, is a facility that allows you to do repetitive things easily. In tuition is a part of what you are, but habit is wholly learned (and c an be unlearned). "},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 247 He buys when he senses that he should, perhaps beca use his intuition notices a critical similarity between current marke t conditions and earlier situations (not explicitly remembered) that proved to be profitable. Or he may stay out of a market because, unconsciously, he detects a hazard that others haven’t noticed – one that makes him uneasy. If you ask him how he made his decision, he probabl y won’t say, “It just felt right to me” – even though that may be th e most accurate answer. More likely, he’ll cite a half-dozen econom ic factors or technical indicators to explain his judgment. But it’s unlikely that those were the deciding fact ors. For one thing, there were similar indicators that pointed in the o pposite direction. The things he cites may be important – but his fina l decision was intuitive, and thus doesn’t allow a complete explan ation. However, the fact that he can’t explain why he acte d as he did doesn’t mean he didn’t have good reason for what he did. Experience Investment talent operates intuitively for the most part. And it draws on experience – which provides a fund of informatio n for intuition to process. Financial experience isn’t the only kind that serve s you. In making investment decisions, you draw upon what you know a bout human nature; on what life has taught you about making de cisions; on what you’ve found to be logical or silly, careful or car eless; on your ability to evaluate people’s opinions and arguments; on you r memories of how fads and fashions have changed; and on thousand s of facts of life. Experience of any kind contributes to your ability to make good intuitive decisions."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 248 Intuition & “Gut Feelings” Intuition has gotten a bad name – in part because s o many people try to dignify mere guesses, hopes, and wishes by citin g the authority of their “instincts” or “gut feelings.” But you can’t convert a bad investment decision int o a good one, or succeed with a sloppy strategy, by saying that your “gut feelings” are telling you to do something. Intuition is valuable, and should always be respect ed. But it’s no better than your talent, intelligence, and experien ce. And it doesn’t have the power to overrule reality; in any conflict between feelings and logic, let logic prevail. My purpose in discussing intuition isn’t to encoura ge you to disregard logic and reality. My purpose is only to explain wh y it is that some people succeed without being able to give satisfact ory reasons for their success. RULES Some writers and advisors promise to turn you into a successful speculator by teaching you the rules for beating th e markets – rules formulated from the words of great achievers."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 249 Doers & Teachers But great achievers are rarely good teachers. They aren’t necessarily even good thinkers. So you’re asking a financial ge nius to have a second great talent when you expect him to explain how his genius works. This is true in any line of work. For example, ask a successful salesman how he does so well. He can’t really expla in his craft, but he won’t want to seem stupid or unsociable. For want of a better answer, he’ll probably repeat what he’s read in the company manual or in books on selling. He’ll te ll you he makes extra calls every day, remembers everyone’s name, n ever takes “no” for an answer, controls the interview – all the pla titudes of selling. But his answer doesn’t explain anything, because mo st other salesmen do these things, too, as best they can. He doesn’t know what to say because he doesn’t know why he’s a superior salesman. He can’t explain how he senses which prospects are more likely to buy or which approach a given prospect will respond to, or how he knows when to ask for the order. Part of his talent is that such decisions are obvious to him. You might as well ask a bird how it flies as to ask the salesman how to be sensitive to peopl e’s wants. Few people would think to ask a great athlete how h e runs so fast. We know that good training improves his running abilit y, but we also know that his speed is primarily a natural talent. So we don’t ask him to concoct a recipe that will enable anyone to run a four-minute mile. In the same way, but less obviously, some people ar e born mechanics, born designers, or born speculators. Such a person reacts intuitively to each situation as it develops; don’t expect him to reduce his talent to a list of explicit rules. "},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 250 Honest Answers Some achievers believe they do know why they succee d, but their opinions aren’t always correct. Intuition can’t be observed, even by the person usi ng it. So it’s very easy for someone to attribute his success to the wr ong thing, to a rule that isn’t really used, or even to an elaborate ana lytical system that’s unworkable. I’ve often seen an advisor or speculato r credit a successful investment or career to reasons that sim ply made no sense. It would be a lot more helpful if the great achieve r explained his latest coup by saying, “I acted as I did because it felt like the right thing to do.“ Hearing such an answer, one would be less like ly to try to imitate his methods. However, as with the salesman who recited platitude s, few achievers are comfortable conceding that they don’t fully und erstand their own success. Exceptions to Rules Rules are attempts to describe the methods of succe ssful individuals. But even the most perceptive and articulate genius can’t tell you what he would do in every conceivable situation. Every formal rule has many exceptions, since its au thor can’t imagine every circumstance that might arise. When he runs i nto an exceptional situation, he’ll adapt accordingly. But people who are trying to act on his rule have no way of knowing that a circumstance is exceptional until they trip over it. In addition, a situation may appear to be governed by more than one rule. Accommodating contradictory rules may be easy for the intuitive genius, but his followers might not know how to dea l with the dilemma."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 251 This is one reason that technical analysis works fo r some investors but not for others who know and apply the same written rules. There are judgments involved that everyone will make in his o wn way – using his own talent. Computer systems for technical analysis seldom work for any length of time because a computer’s only talent is for cal culation. And the computer calculates only within the limits of the r ules that have been programmed into it. Not even the most successful trader can write a com plete program of rules for the computer to follow, because he can’t completely pin down the rules by which he acts. Nor can he imagine in advance every circumstance that might arise. Consequently a compu ter program eventually runs into situations that its creator wo uld handle differently. Application Formal rules are never complete answers. Even if a rule is correct, its application depends upon personal experience and pr esent circumstances. Because people rely so much on intuition, two inves tors can agree on a rule but disagree on its use. They might both say that you should “buy when blood is running in the streets” (buy an investment when all the news about it is bad), but one of them migh t think a pint of blood is a buy signal, while the other waits until he thinks the blood is knee-deep. And even when one of them sees sufficient blood, so mething about the situation may tell him to wait until he determi nes the blood type. But rules do have a value. “Buy when blood is runni ng in the streets” doesn’t really tell you when to buy an investment. But if other"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 252 considerations indicate that now is a good time to buy, the rule can remind you not to be deterred by widespread pessimi sm about the investment. THE ROLE OF INVESTMENT ANALYSIS Allowing for talent and intuition makes it easier t o understand why a theory of investment analysis can work for one pers on but not for another. For example, many academic studies have set out to test various rules of technical analysis. Most of them conclude that t here’s nothing about it that “works.” And yet I’m convinced that s ome investors and advisors use technical analysis profitably; I belie ve I do so myself. How can something fail a systematic test but still be useful in practice? I think it’s because a technician who’s successful uses technical analysis in ways different from what he says – even in ways he doesn’t realize. He succeeds by intuitively followi ng rules he may not have identified. So the rules he recites probably will fail rigorous testing because they aren’t the rules by which he succeeds. They don’t d escribe everything he takes into consideration – or might take into co nsideration. I would be more fitting to test the technician than to test the rules he claims to follow."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 253 Inspiration But even that isn’t the whole story. I doubt that a ny successful technician makes his decisions solely on the basis of what his charts show him. I think he uses technical analysis not so much for the specific answers it gives, but as a routine for keeping in touch wit h the market – and as a tool of inspiration. The charts and indicators an d other paraphernalia of technical analysis may be no more than exercise equipment for his mind. The same is true for any type of investment analysis. The competent analyst studies the data to get his mind in motion, and to get a feel for what the market is doing. He’ll never find objective, scientific evidence to convince him absolutely that an investment or a market will go u p. If there were such evidence, thousands of other investors would a lso see it – and would be bidding up the price. The un talented analyst will use his research in accordanc e with rigid rules – believing he’s responding to clear, unequiv ocal buy and sell signals. But the talented analyst knows that such s ignals don’t exist. He studies the indicators to gain a sense of the ma rket; and nothing he finds is taken as a command to act. Viewing the same ambiguous indicators that the ordi nary analyst views, the talented analyst intuitively makes bette r judgments. And, because opportunities come in shades of promise, part of the judgment he makes is whether to pass up buying oppo rtunities that qualify by the “rules” but just don’t seem right to him. "},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 254 In many cases, an analyst may be using his research only to see whether it contradicts what his intuition is tellin g him – or simply to keep himself busy while his intuition does the real work. When all the analysis is finished, a speculator ent ers a market because it feels right to him – no matter what his favorite tools and indicators tell him. Mechanical Application Those who make wrong judgments about the market fai rly consistently do so, I think, because they’re trying to apply an economic theory or system of analysis they believe in, but lack the talent to handle. Investing and speculating aren’t mechanical techniq ues, like jazzercise. If it were, making money would be as si mple as loading a videocassette, turning on the TV, and jumping up an d down. Speculating requires judgment, adaptation, and imag ination. In the late 1970s, two advisors I know, using eleme nts of fundamental analysis, decided at about the same time that you c ould capitalize on the boom-bust business cycles by switching between common stocks and gold. The cycles had been produced with some re gularity by the Federal Reserve’s policy of stop-and-go expansion o f the money supply. But by the early 1980s, the Fed had changed its app roach, other things had changed as well, and the character of the cycle was altered significantly. One of the advisors abandoned the st rategy almost immediately, while the other continues unsuccessful ly to try to make it work – even in 1987. Those without the touch for speculating get no help from any school of investment analysis – no matter how much they st udy it – because"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 255 they’re mechanically following rules that aren’t su fficient, by themselves, to bring success. MAKING USE OF A GENIUS Some advisors seem to have the touch, and some don’ t. But no one is right all the time, nor is anyone always wrong. Some people do have a talent for imagining realisti c possibilities for the future that others overlook. But the fact remai ns that no one can predict the future reliably or in any profitable de tail. And so even the best speculator will be wrong a goo d part of the time. For this reason, however great his talent may be, h e won’t succeed without a strategy that allows for losses. Unfortunately, many advisors who have a good feel f or the market have no sense of strategy. Following their suggesti ons consistently could lead eventually to bankruptcy. So you can’t succeed by simply doing whatever the g enius is doing. Nor should you automatically bet against the chroni c loser; now and then he’ll miscalculate and do something right. However, it’s worth knowing what these people are u p to. When you’re about to take a speculative position in the market, you’ll want to reexamine your plans if you find that an advisor you respect is taking an opposite position – or if you find that y ou’re marching arm- in-arm with the perennial loser."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 256 LEARNING You can’t learn to be a market genius, but you can learn a great deal to make yourself a good investor and perhaps a bett er speculator than you are now. Investing & Speculating First, we should recognize that investing and specu lating aren’t the same thing. Investing is an attempt to earn a retur n by making your capital available to an investment market. An inves tor is willing to accept the same return (in yield and capital apprec iation) that the market delivers to anyone who invests his capital there. Speculation, on the other hand, is an attempt to ea rn a profit by outguessing the market – by beating the market. The speculator hopes to earn a better return than he could achieve by si mply making his capital available. Buying a group of stocks or mutual funds that repre sent the overall market is investing. Choosing a few stocks or a mut ual fund that you believe will outperform the market is speculating. Holding some gold as a permanent hedge against bad times is investing. Buying gold because you believe inflatio n will come back this year is speculating. Arranging and keeping a Permanent Portfolio to prot ect yourself against anything is investing. Trying to protect yo urself by moving from one investment to another as you perceive the economy moving is speculating."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 257 Learning to Invest There are many things about investing that can and should be learned: the mechanics and practices of various markets (in bonds, options, currencies, and so on), as well as principles for d eveloping a good strategy, for hedging against things you fear, for creating balance and safety, for assessing risk, and more. Learning to Speculate There also are many things you can learn about spec ulating: how to control risk, how to handle losses, how to let your profits run, and so on. Learning these things won’t increase your natural t alent – but they can improve your results, because a realistic strategy is necessary even if you’re good at picking winners. If you have a talent for speculating, you might lea rn from almost anything that has to do with speculation – includin g what other speculators have to say. Financial books and period icals can stimulate your thinking – even if what you read is wrong, mis guided, or unrealistic. You aren’t reading to be told what to do; you’re reading for inspiration – to prod your mind to clarify your own ideas about how markets move. If you have no talent for speculation, that materia l won’t do you much good. And it might confuse or mislead you. You can’t learn how to spot a winner – not through education and not through experience. No one can teach you a feel for markets. But if you do have a talent, there’s a great deal you can do to refine it and to make it more effective."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 258 Your Opportunities Although I’ve spoken of genius in this article, tal ent isn’t an all-or- nothing thing. It comes in all degrees – from a lit tle to a lot. Most people have at least some talent. You don’t have to be a genius to have enough talent to enjoy speculating or even to make money at it. So you may want to try your hand at speculating to see how you do. If you’re just beginning, go slowly. Start by inves ting on paper only – making definite decisions to buy and sell, but with out actually entering the orders. Keep track of the results. If you do actually make the investments, limit them to the minimum practica l size, so that you can’t lose very much. If you find that you do well, then speculate in ear nest. But never get carried away. Always limit speculations to capital you can afford to lose. And no matter what kind of hot streak you find your self on, realize that hot streaks end. Don’t let yourself believe th at you’ve found a system that can’t lose – or that you’re so smart, y ou’ll never lose. Be thankful for every profit you make, and treat ea ch new speculation with the care and humility you gave your first inve stment – because it has just as much chance to go wrong. Motivation On the other hand, you might have no desire to spec ulate. Even if you’re good at investing and speculating, y ou might prefer to spend your time on other things. If so, accept the fact. Don’t adopt a program that asks you to devote more time to your i nvestments than you can give gladly."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 259 If you like to spend hours studying the markets, do so. Enjoy yourself – but know that you’re doing it by choice, not from necessity. If you like, subscribe to dozens of newsletters and stay i n touch with all the telephone hotlines. But if that sort of thing bores you or – worse yet – if it scares you, don’t do it . You don’t have to. No matter what anyone says, you don’t have to becom e a sophisticate, a daredevil, or a busy bee to protect yourself. Don’t Dare to Be Great However, even if you have no talent or interest, yo u can’t afford to neglect the subject of investing entirely. You have to make some financial decisions just to h old on to what you have or to earn a conservative return on your c apital. So, even if you have no aptitude for investing, you have to do something . But you don’t have to become a speculative genius. You can develop a relatively simple plan that’s tailored to your ow n supply of talent and motivation. For example, you don’t need to make talented invest ment decisions to set up a Permanent Portfolio that can protect you. You’ll have to spend a few days working out the details; but from then on, you should be able to take good care of your portfolio by monitoring it only once or twice a year. Whatever you do, recognize your own limits. A sure road to financial ruin is to resolve to do something you don’t know h ow to do, don’t have the talent for, or don’t really want to do. "},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 260 Your investment program will be successful only if it accepts you as you are. Maybe You Will Be Great But, as you evaluate your talents, don’t judge your self too harshly. A few failures don’t mean you’re incompetent. They may mean only that you’ve been trying things that are over your h ead – or that might be unrealistic for anyone to do. And, with time, your knowledge and skills may grow – allowing you to be comfortable with things that now seem exotic, and allowing more of your natural talent to emerge. Some of that talent may have been overruled up to now by attempt to imitate othe r people’s talents. The strategy that’s too sophisticated today may be a breeze tomorrow. So, if you want to be a better investor or speculat or, take the time to read, consider, and test ideas and strategies. But when you act , always recognize the limit of your skills at the time. Don’t undertake investment plans today that g o beyond the abilities you have today. SUMMARY I hope this article has helped to clear up some of the mysteries surrounding successful investors and speculators – and the theories and rules they profess. Talent is the key to speculative success. Talent gi ves some speculators the ability to imagine possibilities that others mi ss, to foresee potential movements in markets, to sense whether the time is right for a move. "},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Harry Browne’s Investment Strategy 261 Talent can’t be learned or imitated. The actions of a talented person can’t even be explained satisfactorily, because tal ent operates largely through intuition. Most explanations of speculative success are mislea ding – even those coming from a successful speculator. He can’t ident ify all the reasons for his decisions, because so many of his decisions are made intuitively. Although many successful investors and advisors att ribute their success to some school of investment analysis or to a system, it’s more likely that those methods are merely tools to exercise the mind – not road maps to profits. A successful speculator u ses investment analysis to gain a general feel for the market and to get his mind in motion – not to arrive at clear-cut, yes-or-no answ ers. So don’t expect to succeed by copying the methods o f a successful person. Don’t expect to get an accurate and satisfy ing answer to the question, “Why did you make this decision?” Speculative talent can’t be reduced to a set of rul es. So don’t expect to acquire such a talent through education. However, education can show you how to be a better investor and a better speculator – to deal with risks more realist ically, to satisfy investment needs more reliably, to protect what you have, and to speculate on the future without risking what’s prec ious to you. And, perhaps, to bring out of you the talent that is there.
