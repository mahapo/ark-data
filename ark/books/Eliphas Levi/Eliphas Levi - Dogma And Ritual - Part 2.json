Every uncurbed passion, every se lfish pleasure, every licentious energy of humanity, and all its tyrannous weakn ess, go before the sordid mistress of our tearful valley, and, scythe in hand, these indefatigable labourers reap their eternal harvest. That queen is old as time, but her skeleton is conc ealed in the wreckage of women's beauty, which she abstracts from their youth and love. Her skull is adorned with lifeless tresses that are not h er own. Spoliator of crowned heads, she is embellished with the plunder of qu eens, from the star-begemmed hair of Berenice to that-white, but not with age -which the executioner sheared from the brow of Marie Antoinette. Her livid and frozen body is clothed in faded garments and tattered winding-sheets. Her bony ha nds, covered with rings, hold diadems and chains, scepters and cro ssbones, jewels an d ashes. When she goes by, doors open of themselves; she pa sses through walls; she penetr ates to the cabinets of kings; she surprises the exto rtioners of the poor in thei r most secret orgies; she sits down at their board, pours out their wine , grins at their song s with her gumless teeth, takes the place of the lecherous courtesan hidde n behind their curtains. She delights to hover about sleeping voluptuar ies; she seeks their caresses, as if she hoped to grow warm in their embrace; but she freezes all those whom she touches and herself never kindles. At times, notwithstanding, one would think her seized with frenzy; she stalks slowly no longer; she runs; if her fe et are too slow, she spurs a pale horse and char ges all breathless throug h multitudes. Murder rides with her on a russet charger; shaking his mane of smoke, fire flies before her with wings of scarlet and black; famine and plague follow on diseased and emaciated steeds, gleaning the few sheaves whic h remain to complete her harvest. After this funereal proce ssion come two little chil dren, radiating with smiles and life, the intelligence and love of th e coming century, the dual genius of a new- born humanity. The shadows of death fo ld up before them, as does night before the morning star; with nimble feet they skim the earth and sow with full hands the hope of another year. But death will come no more , impiteous and terrible, to mow like dry grass the ripe blades of the ne w age; it will give place to the angel of progress, who will gently liberate souls from mortal chains, so that they may ascend to God. When men kno w how to live they will die no longer; they will transform like the chrysalis, which beco mes a splendid butterfly. The terrors of death are daughters of igno rance, and death herself is only hideous by reason of the rubbish which covers her, and the somb re hues with which her images are sur- rounded. Death, truly, is th e birth-pang of life. There is a force in Nature which dieth not, and this force perpetually transf orms beings to preserv e them. It is the reason or word of Nature. In man also ther e is a force analogous to that of Nature, and it is the reason or word of man. Th e word of man is the expression of his will"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"2 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic directed by reason, and it is omnipotent under this le ading, for it is analogous to the word of God Himself. By the word of his reason man becomes conqueror of life, and can triumph over deat h. The entire life of man is either the parturition or miscarriage of his word. Human beings who die without having understood or formulated the word of reason, die devoid of eternal hope. To withstand success- fully the phantom of death, we must be id entified with the realities of life. Does it signify to God if an abortio n wither, seeing that life is eternal? Does it signify to Nature if unreason perish, since reason wh ich never perishes s till holds the keys of life? The just and terrible force which destroys abortio ns eternally was called by the Hebrews Samael; by other easterns, Sa tan; and by the Latins, Lucifer. The Lucifer of the Kabalah is not an accursed and ruined angel; he is the angel who enlightens, who regenerates by fire; he is to the angels of pe ace what the comet is to the mild stars of the spring-time constell ations. The fixed star is beautiful, radi- ant and calm; she drinks the celestial p erfumes and gazes with love upon her sis- ters; clothed in her glittering robe, he r forehead crowned with diamonds, she smiles as she chants her morning and ev ening canticle; she enjoys an eternal repose which nothing can disturb, and m oves solemnly forward without departing from the rank assigned her among the senti nels of light. But the wandering comet, dishevelled and of sanguinary aspect , plunges hurriedly from the depths of heaven and flings he rself athwart the peaceful sphe res, like a chariot of war between the ranks of a procession of vestal s; she dares to face the burning spears of the solar guardians, and, like a be reft spouse who seeks the husband of her dreams during widowed nights, she penetr ates even unto the inmost sanctuary of the god of day; again she esc apes, exhaling the fires which consume her and trail- ing a long conflagration behi nd; the stars pale at her approach; constellate flocks, pasturing on flowers of ligh t in the vast meadows of th e sky, seem to flee before her terrible breath. The grand council of spheres assembles, and there is universal consternation; at length the loveliest of the fixed stars is commissioned to speak in the name of all the fi rmament and offer peace to the headlong vagabond. “My sister,” she thus commences, “why dost thou disturb the harmony of the spheres? What evil have we wrought thee? And why, instead of wandering wildly, dost thou not fix thy place like us in the court of the sun? Why dost thou not chant with us the evening hymn, clothe d like ourselves in a white garment, fas- tened at the breast with a diamond clasp? Why float th y tresses, adrip with fiery sweat, through the mists of the night? Ah , wouldst thou but take thy place among the daughters of heaven, how much more beautiful wouldst thou be! Thy face would burn no longer with th e toil of thine incredible flights; thine eyes would be clear, thy smiling countenan ce white and red like that of thy happy sisters; all the stars would know thee, and, far from fear ing thy flight, would rejoice at thine approach; for then thou woul dst be made one with us by the indestructible bonds"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 3 of universal harmony, and thy peaceful ex istence would be one voice more in the canticle of infinite love.” And the comet replies to the fixed star: “B elieve not, O my si ster, that I am per- mitted to wander at will an d vex the harmony of the spheres! God hath appointed my path, even as thine, and if it a ppear to thee uncertain and vagrant, it is because thy beams cannot penetrate far en ough to take in the circumference of the ellipse which has been allotted for my course. My fiery hair is God's beacon; I am the messenger of the suns, and I rene w my strength continually in their burn- ing heat, that I may dispense it on my journey to young worlds which have as yet insufficient warmth, and to an cient stars which have grown cold in their solitude. If I weary in my long travellings, if my be auty be less mild than thine own, and if my garments are not unspotted, yet am I a noble daughter of heaven, even as thou art. Leave me the secret of my terrible destiny, leave me the dread which sur- rounds me, curse me even if thou canst not comprehend; I shall none the less accomplish my work, and continue my career under the impulse of the breath of God! Happy are the stars which rest, which shine like youthful queens in the peaceful society of the uni verse! I am the proscribed, the eternal wanderer, who has infinity for domain. They accuse me of setting fire to the pl anets, the heat of which I renew; they accuse me of terrifyin g the stars which I en lighten; they chide me with breaking in upon un iversal harmony, because I do not revolve about their particular centres, though I join them one with another, directing my gaze towards the sole centre of al l the suns. Be reassured, therefore, O beauteous fixed star! I shall not impoverish thy peaceful light; rather I shall expend in thy service my own life and heat. I sh all disappear from heaven wh en I shall have consumed myself, and my doom will have been gl orious enough! Know that various fires burn in the temple of God, and do all give Him glory: ye are the light of golden candelabra; I am the flame of sacrifice. Let us each fulfil our destinies.” Having uttered these words, the comet to sses back her burning hair, uplifts her fiery shield and plunges into infinite space, seeming to be lost for ever. Thus Satan appeared and di sappeared in the allegorical narratives of the Bible. “Now there was a day,” says the book of Job, “when the sons of God came to present them selves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan: ‘Whe nce comest thou?’ Then Sa tan answered the Lord, and said: ‘From going to and fro in the eart h, and from walking up and down in it.’” A Gnostic gospel, discovered in the East by a learne d traveller of our acquain- tance, explains the genesi s of light to the profit of Lucifer, as follows: “Self-conscious truth is living thought. Truth is thou ght as it is in itself, and formulated thought is speech. When Eternal Thought desired a form, it said: ‘Let there be light.’ Now, this Thought which speaks is the Word, and the Word said: ‘Let there be light,’ because the Word it self is the light of minds. The untreated"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic light, which is the Divine Wo rd, shines because it desir es to be seen. When it says: ‘Let there be light!’ it or dains that eyes shall open; it creates intelligences. When God said: ‘Let there be light!’ Intelligence was made, and the light appeared. Now, the Intelligence which God diffused by the breath of His mouth, like a star given off from the sun, took the form of a splendid angel, who was saluted by heaven under the name of Lucifer. Intell igence awakened, and comprehended its nature completely by the understanding of that utterance of the Divine Word: ‘Let there be light!’ It felt itself to be free because God had called it into being, and, raising up its head, with both wings extende d, it replied: ‘I will not be slavery.’ ‘Then shalt thou be suffering,’ said the Untr eated Voice. ‘I will be liberty,’ replied the light. ‘Pride wi ll seduce thee,’ said the Supreme Voice, ‘and thou wilt bring forth death.’ ‘I needs must strive with death to conquer life,’ again responded the created light. Thereupon God loosed fr om His bosom the shining cord which restrained the superb angel, and beho lding him plunge through the night, which he furrowed with glory, He loved the offsprin g of His thought, and said with an ineffable smile: ‘How beautiful was the light!’ “God has not created suffering; intelligen ce has accepted it to be free. And suf- fering has been the condition imposed upon freedom of being by Him who alone cannot err, because He is in finite. For the essen ce of intelligence is judgement, and the essence of judgement is liberty. The eye does not really pos sess light except by the faculty of closing or opening. Were it forced to be always open, it would be the slave and victim of the ligh t, and would cease to see in order to escape the tor- ment. Thus, created Intelligence is not ha ppy in affirming God, except by its lib- erty to deny Him. Now, the Intellig ence which denies, in variably affirms something, since it is assertin g its liberty. It is for this reason that blasphemy glo- rifies God and that hell was indispensable to the happin ess of heaven. Were the light unrepelled by shadow, there would be no visible forms. If the first angels had not encountered the depths of darkness, the child-birth of God would have been incomplete, and there could have been no separation between the created and essential light. Never would Intelligence have known th e goodness of God if it had never lost Him. Never would Go d's infinite love have shon e forth in the joys of His mercy had the prodigal Son of Heaven r emained in the House of His Father. When all was light, there wa s light nowhere; it filled the breast of God, who was labouring to bring it forth. And when He said: ‘Let th ere be light!’ He permitted the darkness to repel the light, and the universe issued from chaos. The negation of the angel who at birth re fused slavery constituted th e equilibrium of the world, and the motion of the spheres commenced . The infinite distances admired this love of liberty, which was vast enough to fill the void of eter nal night and strong enough to bear the hatred of God. But Go d could hate not the noblest of His chil- dren, and He proved him by His wrath only to confirm him in His power. So also the Word of God Himself, as if jealous of Lucifer, willed to come down from"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 5 heaven and pass triumphantly through the sh adows of hell. He willed to be pro- scribed and condemned; He premeditated th at terrible hour when He should cry, in the throes of His agony: ‘My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?’ As the star of the morning goes before the su n, the rebellion of Lucifer announced to new-born Nature the coming incarnation of God. Possibly Lucifer, in his fall through night, carried with him a rain of suns and star s by the attraction of his glory. Possibly our sun is a demon among th e stars, as Lucifer is a star among the angels. Doubtless it is for this reason that it lights so calmly the horrible anguish of humanity and the long agony of earth -beca use it is free in it s solitude and pos- sesses its light.” Such were the tendencies of the heresi archs in the early centuries. Some, like the Ophites, adored the demon under the figu re of a serpent; ot hers, like the Cain- ites, justified the rebellion of the first angel and that of the first murderer. All those errors, all those shadows, all thos e monstrous idols of anarchy which India opposes in its symbols to the magical Trimurti, have found priests and worship- pers in Christianity. The demon is mention ed nowhere in Genesis; an allegorical serpent deceives our first parents. Here is the co mmon translation of the sacred text: “Now, the serpent was more subtle th an any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.” But this is what Moses says: This signifies, according to the version of Fabre d'Olivet: “Now, original attrac- tion (cupidity) was the entraining passion of all elementary life (the interior activ- ity of Nature), the work of Jhoah, the Be ing of beings.” But herein Fabre d'Olivet is beside the true interpretation, beca use he was unacquainted with the grand keys of the Kabalah. The word Nahash, ex plained by the symbol ical letters of the Tarot signifies rigorously 14 i NUN.-The power which pr oduces combinations. 5 x HE.-The recipient and passive producer of forms. 21 e SHIN.-The natural and central fire equilibrated by double polarization. Thus, the word employed by Moses, read kabalistically, gi ves the description and definition of that m agical Universal Agent, repr esented in all theogonies by the serpent; to this Agent th e Hebrews applied the name of O D when it manifested its active force, of O B when it exhibited its passive force, and of A OUR when it revealed itself wholly in its equilibrated power, as producer of light in heaven and gold among metals. It is therefore that ol d serpent which encircles the world and places its devouring head bene ath the foot of a Virgin, th e type of initiation –that virgin who presents a little new-born ch ild to the adoration of three Magi and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"6 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic receives from them, in exchange for this favour, gold, myrrh and frankincense. So does doctrine serve in al l hieratic religions to veil the secret of natural forces which the initiate has at his disposal. Religious form ulae are the summaries of those words full of myst ery and power which make the gods descend from heaven and become subject to the will of men. Judea borrowed its secrets from Egypt; Greece sent her hierophants and later her theosophists to the school of the great prophets; the Rome of the Caesars, mined by the initiation of the catacombs, col- lapsed one day into the Church, and a sy mbolism was reconstr ucted with the rem- nants of all worships which had been absorbed by the queen of the world. According to the Gospel narrative, the inscription which set forth the spiritual royalty of Christ was written in Hebrew, in Greek and in Latin: it was the expres- sion of a universal synthesis. Hellenism, in fact, that grand and beauteous religion of form, announced the coming of the Saviour no less th an the prophets of Juda- ism. The fable of Psyche is an ultra-Christian abstrac tion, and the cultus of the Pantheons, by rehabilitating Socrates, pr epared altars for that unity of God, of which Israel had been the mysterious pr eserver. But the synagogue denied its Mes- siah, and the Hebrew letters were effaced, at least for the blinde d eyes of the Jews. The Roman persecutors dishonoured Hellen ism, and it could not be restored by the false moderation of the philosopher Julian, surnamed perhaps unjustly the Apostate, since his Christianity was neve r sincere. The ignorance of the Middle Ages followed, opposing saints and virg ins to gods, goddesses and nymphs; the deep sense of the Hellenic mysteries was less understood than ever; Greece herself did not only lose the traditions of her an cient cultus but separated from the Latin Church; and thus, for Latin eyes, the Greek letters were blotted out, as the Latin letters disappeared for Greek eyes. So the inscription on the Cross of the Saviour vanished entirely, and nothing except myst erious initials rema ined. But when sci- ence and philosophy, reconciled with fait h, shall unite all the various symbols, then shall the magnificences of the antique worships be restored to the memory of men, proclaiming the progress of the huma n mind in the intuition of the light of God. But of all forms of prog ress the greatest w ill be that which, restoring the keys of Nature to the hands of science, shall enchain for ever the hideous spectre of Satan, and, explaining all abnormal phenomena, shall destroy the empire of superstition and imbecile credulity. To the accomplishment of this work we have consecrated our life, and do still devote it in the most toilsome and difficult researches. We would emancipate altars by overthrowing idols; we desire the man of intelligence to become on ce more the priest and king of Nature, and we would preserve by explanation all image s of the universal sanctuary. The prophets spoke in parables and im ages, because abstract language was wanting to them, and because prophetic perception, being th e sentiment of har- mony or of universal analogi es, translates naturally into images. Taken literally by the vulgar, these images become idols or impenetrab le mysteries. The sum and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 7 succession of such images and mysteries constitute what is called symbolism. Symbolism comes therefore from God, thou gh it may be formulated by men. Rev- elation has accompanied humanity in all ages, has been transfigured with human genius but has ever expressed the same truth. True religi on is one; its dogmas are simple and within the reach of all. At the same time, the mul tiplicity of symbols has been a book of poesy indispensable to the education of human genius. The harmony of outward beauties and the poet ry of form must reveal God to the infancy of man; but soon Venus had Psyche for her ri val and Psyche enchanted Love. It came about therefor e that the cultus of form yielded perforce to those ambitious dreams which adorne d already the eloquent wisd om of Plato. Thus was the advent of Christ prepar ed and was therefore also ex pected; it arrived because the world awaited it; and to become popul ar, philosophy transformed into belief. Emancipated by belief itself, the human mind protested speedily against the school which sought to materialize its signs and the work of Roman Catholicism was solely an undesigned provision for the emancipation of consciences and the establishment of the bases of universal asso ciation. All these thin gs were the regu- lar and normal development of divine life in humanity; for God is the great Soul of all souls, that immovable Centre about which gravita te all intelligences like a cloud of stars. Human understanding has had its mornin g; its noon shall come, and the wan- ing follow; but God will be ever the same. It seems, however, to dwellers on earth that the sun rises youthful and timid in th e morning, shines wi th all its power at midday and goes wearied to rest in the ev ening. Nevertheless, it is earth which revolves, while the sun is motionless. Having faith therefore in human progress, and in the stability of God, the free man respects religion in its past forms, and no more blasphemes Jupiter than Jehovah. He stil l salutes lovingly the radiant image of the Pythian Apollo and discovers it s fraternal resemblance to the glorified countenance of the risen Red eemer. He believes in the gr eat mission of the Catho- lic hierarchy, and finds satisfaction in observing the popes of the Middle Ages who opposed religion as a check upon the absolu te power of kings; but he protests with the revolutionary centuries against the serv itude of conscience which the pontifi- cal keys would enchain. He is more protestant than Lu ther, since he does not even believe in the infallibility of the Augs bourg Confession, and more Catholic than the Pope, for he has no fear that religious unity will be broken by the malevolence of courts. He trusts in God rather than Roman policy for the salvation of the unity idea; he respects the old age of the Church, but he has no fear th at she will die; he knows that her apparent de ath will be a transfigurat ion and a glorious assump- tion. The author of this book calls upon the eastern Magi to come forward and rec- ognize once again that Divine Master Whose cr adle they saluted, the Great Initia- tor of all the ages.

The envious have combined agains t Him, agreeing on a single point; the sectaries have united to destroy Him; they have crowned themselves kings and proscribed Him; they have become hypocrites and accused Him; they have consti- tuted themselves judges and pr onounced His sentence of death; they have turned murderers and executed Him; they have forced Him to drink hemlock, they have crucified Him, they have stoned Him, th ey have burned Him and cast His ashes to the wind; then have they turned scarlet with terror, for He stands erect before them, impeaching them by His wounds and overwhelm ing them by the radiance of His scars. They believed that they had slain Hi m in His cradle at Bethlehem, but He is alive in Egypt. They carry Him to the summit of the mountain to cast Him down; the mob of His d estroyers encircles Him and triumphs already in His certain destruction. A cry is heard: is no t that He who is shattered on the rocks of the abyss? They whiten a nd look at one another; but He, calm and smiling with pity, passes through the midst of them and disappears. Behold another mountain which they have just dyed with His bl ood! Behold a Cross, a sepulchre and sol- diers guarding His tomb! Madmen! The tomb is empty, and He whom they regard as dead is walking peaceably between two travellers on the road to Emmaus. Where is He? Whither does He go? Warn the masters of the world! Tell the Cae- sars that their power is threatened! By whom? By a pauper who has no stone on which to lay His head, by a Man of the People condemned to the death of slaves. What insult or what madness! It matter s not. The Caesars marshal all their power; sanguinary edicts proscribe th e fugitive; everywher e scaffolds rise up; amphitheaters open, crowded wi th lions and gladiators; pyres are lighted; torrents of blood flow; and the Caesa rs, believing themselves vict orious, dare add another name to those they rehearse on their tro phies. Then they die, and their own apo- theosis dishonours the gods whom they de fended. The hatred of the world con- founds Jupiter and Nero in a common co ntempt. Temples transformed into tombs are cast down over proscribed ashes, and above th e debris of idol s, above ruins of empires, He only, He whom the Caesars indicted, whom so many satellites pur- sued, whom so many executioners tortured , He only lives, al one reigns, alone tri- umphs! Notwithstanding, His own disciples speedil y misuse His name; pride enters the sanctuary; those who should proclaim Hi s resurrection seek to immortalize His death, that they may feed, like ravens, on His ever-renewing fles h. In place of imi- tating Him in His sacrifice and shedding their blood for their children in the faith, they chain Him in the Vati can, as upon another Cauc asus, and become the vul- tures of this divine Promet heus. But what signifies th eir evil dream? They can only imprison His image; He Himself is free and erect, proceeding from exile to exile and from conquest to conquest. It is possible to bind a man but not to make captive the Word of God; sp eech is free, and nothing can repress it. This living"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 9 speech is the condemnation of the wicked, and hence they seek to destroy it; but it is they only who die, and the Word of Truth remains to judge their memory! Orpheus may have been rent by bacchante s; Socrates may have quaffed the poi- soned cup; Jesus and His apostles have peri shed in the utmost tortures; John Hus, Jerome of Prague, and i nnumerable others, have been burned; St. Bartholomew and the massacres of September may have had in turn their victims; Cossacks, knouts and Siberian deserts are still at th e disposal of the Russian Emperor; but the spirit of Orph eus, of Socrates, of Jesus and of all martyrs will live for ever in the midst their dead persecuto rs, will stand erect amidst decaying institutions and collapsing empires. It is this Divine Spirit, the Spirit of the on ly Son of God, which St. John represents in his Apocalypse, standing between gol den candlesticks, because He is the centre of all lights; h aving seven stars in His hand, like the seed of a new heaven; and sending down speech upon the earth unde r the symbol of a two-edged sword. When the wise in their discouragement sleep through the night of doubt, the Spirit of Christ is erect and vigilant. When the nations, weary of the labour which emancipates them, lie down and dream over their chains, the Spirit of Christ is erect and protesting. When th e blind partisans of sterilized religions cast themselves in the dust of old temples, the Spirit of Christ is erect and praying. When the strong become weak, when virt ues are corrupted, when all things bend and sink down in search of a shameful pasture, the Spirit of Christ is erect, gazing up to heaven and awaiting the hour of His Father. Christ signifies priest an d king by excellence. The Christ-initiator of modern times came to form new priests and new ki ngs by science and, above all, by char- ity. The ancient Magi were priests and kings, and the Saviour's advent was pro- claimed to them by a star. This star was the magical Pentagram, having a sacred letter at each point. It is the symbol of intelligence which rules by unity of force over the four elementary pote ncies; it is the Pentagram of the Magi, the Blazing Star of the Children of Hiram, the pr ototype of equilibrated light. Towards each of its points a beam of li ght ascends, and from each a beam goes forth; it repre- sents the Grand and Supreme Athanor of Nature, which is the body of man. The magnetic influence issues in two rays fr om the head, from e ither hand and either foot. The positive ray is balanced by th e negative. The head corresponds with the two feet, each hand with a hand and foot, each of the two feet with the head and one hand. This ruling sign of equilibrate d light represents the spirit of order and harmony; it is the sign of the omnipote nce of the Magus, and hence, when broken or incorrectly drawn, it represents astral intoxication, abnormal and ill-regulated projections of Astral Li ght and therefore bewitchments, perversity, madness-all that, in a word, which the Magi term the Signature of Lucifer. There is another signature which also symbolizes the My steries of Light, namely, the Sign of Solomon, whose talismans bear on one si de the impression of his seal which we have given in our “Doctrin e,” and on the other the following signature which is"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic the hieroglyphic theory of the compositio n of magnets and represents the circula- tory law of the lightning. Rebellious spirits are enchained by the exhibition of the fi ve-pointed Blazing Star or the Seal of Solo mon, because each gives th em proof of their folly and threatens them with a sove reign power capable of torm enting them by their recall to order. Nothing tortures the wicked so much as goodness. Nothing is more odi- ous to madness than reason. But if an ig norant operator should make use of these signs without knowing them, he is like a blind man who discourses of light to the blind, an ass who would teach children to read. “If the blind lead the bli nd,” said the Great and Divine Hierophant, “both fall into the pot.” And now a final word to recapitulate this entire introduction. If you be blind like Samson when you cast down the pillars of the temp le, its ruins will crush you. To command Nature we must be above Nature, by resistan ce of her attractions. If your mind be perfectly free from all prej udice, superstition and incredulity, you will rule spirits. If you do not obey blind forces, they will obey you. If you be wise like Solomon, you will perform the works of Solomon; if you be holy like Christ, you will accomplish the work s of Christ. To direct the currents of the inconstant light, we must be establ ished in the constant light. To command the elements, we must have overcome their hurricanes, th eir lightnings, their abysses, their tem- pests.

It is action which proves life and estab- lishes will. Hence it is said in the sacr ed and symbolical b ooks that men will be judged, not according to their thoughts and their ideas, but according to their works. We must do in order to be. We have, therefore, to treat in this place of the grand an d terrific question of magical works; we are concerned no lo nger with theories and abstractions; we approach realities, and we ar e about to place the wand of miracles in the hands of the adept, saying to him at the same time: “Be not sati sfied with what we tell you: act for yourself.” We have to deal here with works of relative omnipotence, with the means of laying hold upon the great est secrets of Nature and compelling them into the service of an enli ghtened and inflexible will. Most known Magical Rituals are either my stifications or enigmas, and we are about to rend for the first time, after so many centurie s, the veil of the occult sanctuary. To reveal the holiness of myst eries is to provide a remedy for their pro- fanation. Such is the thought which sustai ns our courage and enables us to face all the perils of this enterp rise, possibly the most dang erous which it has been per- mitted the human mind to conceive and carry out. Magical operations are the exercise of a natural power, but one superior to the ordinary forces of Nature. They are the result of a science and a practice which exalt human will beyond its normal limits. The supernatural is only the natural in an extraordinary grade, or it is the exalted natural; a miracle is a phenomenon which impresses the multitude because it is unexpected ; the astonishing is that which astonishes; miracles are effects wh ich surprise those who are ignorant of their causes, or assign them causes which are not in prop ortion to effects. Miracles exist only for the ignorant, but as ther e is scarcely any absolute science among men, the supernatural can still obtain, and does so indeed for the whole world. Let us set out by saying that we believ e in all miracles because we are convinced and certain, even from our own experience, of their entire possibility. There are some which we do not explain, though we regard them as no less explicable. From the greater to the lesser, from the lesser to the greater, the consequences are related identically and the proportions progressively rigorous. But in order to work miracles we must be outside the normal conditions of humanity; we must be either abstracted by wisdom or exalted by madness, either supe rior to all passions or outside them through ecstasy or frenzy. Such is the fi rst and most indispensable preparation of the operator. Hence, by a providential or fatal law, the magician can only exercise omnipotence in inverse proportion to his material interest; the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"12 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic alchemist makes so much the more gold as he is the more resigned to privations, and the more esteems that poverty wh ich protects the secrets of the magnum opus.

The myth of Genesis is eternally true, and God perm its the tree of knowledge to be approached only by those men who are sufficiently strong and self-denying not to covet its fruits: Ye therefore who seek in scienc e a means to satisfy your passi ons, pause in this fatal way: you will find nothing but madness or death. This is the meaning of the vul- gar tradition that the devil ends sooner or later by strangling sorcerers. The Magus must be impassible, sober and ch aste, disinterested, impenetrable and inaccessible to any kind of prejudice or terr or. He must be with out bodily defects and proof against all contradictions and al l difficulties. The fi rst and most impor- tant of magical operations is the at tainment of this rare pre-eminence. We have said that impassioned ecstasy may produce the same results as abso- lute superiority, and this is true as to th e issue but not as to the direction of magi- cal operations. Passion projects the Astral Light forcibly and impresses unforeseen movements on the Universal Agent, but it cannot curb with the facility that it impels, and then its destin y resembles that of Hipp olytus dragged by his own horses, or Phalaris victimi zed himself by the instrumen t of torture which he had invented for others. Human vol ition realized by action is like a cannon-ball and recedes before no obstacle. It either passes through it or is buried in it; but if it advance with patience and perse verance, it is never lost: it is like the wave which returns incessantly and we ars away iron in the end. Man can be modified by habit, which b ecomes, according to the proverb, his second nature. By means of persevering and graduated at hletics, the powers and activity of the body can be developed to an astonishing extent. It is the same with the powers of the soul. Would you reign over yourselves and others? Learn how to will. How can one learn to will? This is the first arcanum of magical initiation, and that it might be realized fundamenta lly the ancient custodians of sacerdotal art surrounded the approach es of the sanctuary with so many terrors and illu- sions. They recognized no will until it had produced its proofs, and they were right. Power is justified by attainment. Indolence and forgetfulness are enemies of will, and for this reason al l religions have multiplied their observances and made their worship minute and di fficult. The more we deny ourselves for an idea, the greater is the strength we acquire within the scope of that idea. Are not mothers more partial to the children who have ca used them most suffering and cost them most anxieties? So does the power of reli gions reside exclusively in the inflexible will of those who practise th em. So long as there is on e faithful person to believe in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, there will be a priest to cele brate it fo r him; and so long as there is a priest who daily re cites his Breviary, there will be a pope in the world. Observances, apparently most insignificant and most foreign in them-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PREPARATIONS 13 selves to the proposed end, lead notwithstanding to that end by education and exercise of will. If a peasant rose up ever y morning at two or three o'clock and went a long distance from home to gather a sprig of the same herb before the ris- ing of the sun, he would be able to p erform a great number of prodigies by merely carrying this herb upon his person, for it would be the sign of his will, and in vir- tue thereof would be all that he required it to become in the inte rest of his desires. In order to accomplish a thin g we must believe in our po ssibility of doing it, and this faith must be translated at once into acts. When a child says: “I cannot,” his mother answers: “Try.” Faith do es not even try; it begins with the certitude of fin- ishing, and it proceeds calm ly, as if omnipotence were at its disposal and eternity before it. What seek you therefore from th e science of the Magi? Dare to formulate your desire, then set to work at once, a nd do not cease acting after the same man- ner and for the same end. That which you will shall come to pa ss, and for you and by you it has indeed alread y begun. Sixtus V said, wh ile watching his flocks: “I desire to be pope.” You are a beggar and you desire to make gold: set to work and never leave off. I promise you in the name of science all the treasures of Flamel and Raymund Lully. “What is the first th ing to be done?” Be lieve in your power, then act. “But how act?” Ri se daily at the same hour, and that early; bathe at a spring before daybreak, and in all seasons ; never wear soiled clothes: wash them yourself at need; practise vol untary privations, that you may be better able to bear those which come without seeking: then silence every desire which is foreign to the fulfilment of the Great Work. “What! By bathing daily in a spring, I shall make gold?” You will work in order to make it. “It is a mockery!” No, it is an arca num. “How can I make use of an arcanum which I fail to understand ?” Believe and act; you will understand later. One day a person said to me: “I would that I might be a fervent Catholic, but I am a Voltairean. What would I not give to have faith!” I replied: “Say ‘I would’ no longer; say ‘I will ’, and I promise you that you will believe. You tell me that you are a Voltairean, and of all the var ious presentations of faith that of the Jesuits is most repugnant to you, but at the same time seems the strongest and most desirable. P erform the exercises of St. Ignatius again and again, without allowing yourself to be discouraged, and you will attain the fait h of a Jesuit. The result is infallible, and shou ld you then have the simplici ty to ascribe it to a mira- cle, you deceive yourself now in th inking that you are a Voltairean.” An idle man will never become a magici an. Magic is an exercise of all hours and all moments. The operator of great wo rks must be absolute master of himself; he must know how to repress the alluremen ts of pleasure, appetite and sleep; he must be insensible to success and to indi gnity. His life must be that of a will directed by one thought and served by entire Nature, which he will have made subject to mind in his own organs, and by sympathy in all the universal forces which are their correspondents.

The magical idea must be turned into light for the eyes , harmony for the ea rs, perfumes for the sense of smell, savours for the palate, objects for the touch. The op erator, in a word, must realize in his wh ole life that which he wishes to realize in the world without him; he must become a MAGNET to attract the desired thing; and when he shall be sufficiently magnetic, let him be assured that the th ing will come of itself, and without thinking of it. It is important for the Magus to be ac quainted with the secr ets of science, but he may know them by intuit ion, and without formal le arning. Solitaries living in the habitual contemplation of Nature, fr equently divine her harmonies and are more instructed in their simple good sense th an doctors, whose natural discern- ment is falsified by the sophistries of the schools. Tr ue practical magicians are found almost invariably in the country, and are frequently uninstructed persons and simple shepherds. Furthermore, cer tain physical organ izations are better adapted than others for the revelations of the occult world. There are sensitive and sympathetic natures, with whom intuiti on in the Astral Light is, so to speak, inborn; certain afflictions and certain complaints react upon the nervous system and, independently of the concurrence of the will, may convert it into a divinatory apparatus of less or more perfection. But these phenomena are exceptional, and generally magical power should and can be acquired by perseverance and labour. There are also some substances which pr oduce ecstasy and dispose towards the magnetic sleep; there are some which pla ce at the service of imagination all the most lively and highly coloured reflections of the elementary light; but the use of such things is dangerous, for they tend to occasion st upefaction and intoxication. They are used notwithstanding, but in carefully calculated quantities and under wholly exceptional circumstances. He who decides to devote himself seriously to magica l works, after fortifying his mind against all danger of hallucinat ion and fright, must purify himself with- out and within for forty days. The number forty is sacred, and its very figure is magical. In Arabic numerals it consists of the circle, wh ich is a type of the infinite, and of the 4 , which sums the triad by unity. In Roman numerals, arranged after the following manner, it represents the si gn of the fundamental doctrine of Her- mes and the character of the Seal of Solomon:"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PREPARATIONS 15 The purification of the M agus consists in the renunc iation of coarse enjoy- ments, in a temperate and vegetarian diet , in abstinence from intoxicating drink, and in regulating the hours of sleep. Th is preparation has been imposed and rep- resented in all forms of worship by a peri od of penitence and trials preceding the symbolical feasts of life-renewal. As already stated, the most scrupulous ex ternal cleanliness must be observed: the poorest person can find spring water. All clothes, furniture and vessels made use of must be also washed carefully, whether by our selves or others . All dirt is evidence of negligence, and negligence is deadly in Magic. The atmosphere must be purified at rising and retiring with a perfume composed of the juice of laurels, salt, camphor, white resin and sulphur, repeating at the same time the four Sacred Words, while turning successively toward s the four cardinal points. We must divulge to no one the works that we accomplish, for, as specified in our “Doc- trine”, mystery is the exact and essenti al condition of all operations of science. The inquisitive must be mi sled by the pretence of ot her occupations and other researches, such as chemic al experiments for industri al purposes, hygienic pre- scriptions, the investigation of some natura l secrets, and so on; but the forbidden name of Magic must never be pronounced. The Magus must be isolated at the begi nning and difficult to approach, so that he may concentrate his powe r and select his poin ts of contact; but in proportion as he is austere and inacce ssible at first, so will he be popular and sought after when he shall have magnetized his chai n and chosen his place in a current of ideas and of light. A labori ous and poor existence is so favourable to practical ini- tiation that the greatest masters have pr eferred it, even when the wealth of the world was at their disposal. Then it is th at Satan, otherwise the spirit of igno- rance, who scorns, suspects an d detests science because at heart he fears it, comes to tempt the future master of the world by saying to him: “I f thou art the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.” Then it is that mercenary men seek to humiliate the prince of knowledge by perplexing , depreciating, or sordidly exploiting his labour, the slice of bread that he deigns to need is broken into ten fragments, so that he may stretch fort h his hand ten times. But the Magus does not even smile at the absurdity, and calmly pursues his work. So far as may be possible, we must avoid the sight of hideous objects and uncomely persons, must decline eating wi th those whom we do not esteem, and must live in the most uni form and studied manner. We should hold ourselves in the highest respect and cons ider that we are dethroned sovereigns who consent to existence in order to reconquer our crowns . We must be mild and considerate to all, but in social relations must never permit ourselves to be absorbed, and must withdraw from circles in which we cannot acquire some initiative.

This religion has existed always in the world, and under many names has been ev er the one and ruling religion. It has now among the nations of th e earth three apparently ho stile forms, which are des- tined, however, to unite before long fo r the constitution of a universal Church. I refer to the Greek orthodoxy, Roman Cath olicism and a final transfiguration of the religion of Buddha. Hereunto therefore we have made it plain, as we be lieve, that our Magic is opposed to the goetic and necromantic kinds . It is at once an absolute science and religion, which should not indeed destroy and absorb all opinions and all forms of worship, but should regenerate and direct th em by reconstituting the circle of ini- tiates, and thus providing the blind masses with wi se and clear-seeing leaders. We are living at a period when nothin g remains to destroy and everything to remake. “Remake what? The past?” No one can remake the past. “What, then, shall we reconstruct? Temples and thro nes?” To what purpose, since the former ones have been cast down? “You might as well say: my house has collapsed from age, of what use is it to build another?” But will the house that you contemplate erecting be like that which has fallen? No, for the one was old and the other will be new. “Notwithstanding, it will be always a house. ” What else can you expect?"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"17 CHAPTER II MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUM EQUILIBRIUM is the consequence of two forces. If two forces are absolutely and invariably equal, the equili brium will be immobility and therefore the negation of life. Movement is the result of an alternate preponderance. The impulsion given to one of the sides of a bala nce necessarily det ermines the motion of the other. Thus contraries act on one another, throughout all Nature, by correspondence and ana- logical connexion. All life is composed of an inspiration and a respiration; creation postulates a shadow to serve as a bound fo r light, of a void to serve as space for the plenitude, of a passive fr uctified principle to sust ain and realize the power of the active generating princi ple. All Nature is bisexual, and the movement which produces the appearances of death and life is a continual generation. God loves the void, which He made in order to fill it; science loves the ignorance which it enlightens; strength loves the weakness wh ich it supports; good loves the apparent evil which glorifies it; day is desirous of night, and pursues it unceasingly round the world; love is at once a thirst and a plenitude whic h must pour itself forth. He who gives receives, and he who receives gives; movement is a continual inter- change. To know the law of this change , to be acquainted with the alternate or simultaneous proportion of these forces, is to possess th e first principles of the Great Magical Arcanum, which constitutes true human divinity. Scientifically, we can appreciate the various manifestations of the universal movement through electric or magnetic phenomena. Electrica l apparatuses above all reveal materi- ally and positively the af finities and antipathies of certain substances. The mar- riage of copper with zinc, the action of all metals in the galvanic pile, are perpetual and unmistakable revelations. Let physicists seek and find out; ever will the Kabalist explain th e discoveries of science! The human body is subject, li ke the earth, to a dual law; it attracts and it radi- ates; it is magnetized by an androgyne magnetism and re acts inversely on the two powers of the soul, the intellectual and sensi tive, but in proportion to the alternat- ing preponderances of the two sexes in th eir physical organism. The art of the magnetizer consists wholly in the knowledge and use of this law. To polarize action and impart to the agent a bisexual and alternat e force is a method still unknown and sought vainly for directing the phenomena of magnetism at will. Highly trained judgement and great prec ision in the interior movements are required to prevent confusion between signs of magnetic inspiration and those of respiration. We must be perfectly acquai nted, moreover, with occult anatomy and the special temperament of the persons on whom we are operating. Bad faith and bad will in subjects constitute the gr avest hindrance to the direction of magne- tism. Women above all – wh o are essentially and invar iably actresses, who take"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"18 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic pleasure in impressing others so that they may impress th emselves, and are the first to be deceived when playing their neurotic melodramas – are the true Black Magic of magnetism. So is it for ever im possible that magne tizers who are uniniti- ated in the supreme secret s and unassisted by the li ghts of the Kabalah should govern this refractory and fugitive elemen t. To be master of woman, we must dis- tract and deceive her skilfully by allowi ng her to suppose that it is she who is deceiving us. This advice, which we offer chiefly to magnetic physicians, might find its place and applicat ion in conjugal polity. Man can produce two breathings at his pleasure, one warm and the other cold; he can project also either active or passiv e light at will; but he must acquire the consciousness of this power by dwelling habitually thereon. The same manual gesture may assimilate and gi ve forth alternately what we are accustomed to call the fluid, and the magnetizer will himself be warned of the result of his intention by an alternative sensation of warmth and cold in the hand, or in both hands when both are being used, which sensation the subject should experience at the same time, but in a contrary sense, that is, with a wholly opposite alternative. The Pentagram, or Sign of the Microcosmos, represe nts, among other magical mysteries, the double sympathy of the human extremities with, each other and with the circulation of the Astral Ligh t in the human body. Thus, when a man is represented in the star of the Pentagram, as may be seen in the Occult Philosophy of Agrippa, it should be observed that the head corresponds in masculine sympa- thy with the right foot and in feminine sympathy with th e left foot; that the right hand corresponds in the same way with the left hand and left foot, and recipro- cally of the other hand. This must be borne in mind when making magnetic passes, if we seek to govern the whole organism and bi nd all members by their proper chains of analogy and natural sympathy. Similar knowledge is required for the use of the Pentagram in the Conjuration of Spirits , and in the evocation of forms errant in the Astral Ligh t, vulgarly called Necrom ancy, as we shall explain in the fifth chapter of this “Ritual”. But it is well to observe here that every action promotes a reaction, and that in magnet izing others, or infl uencing them magi- cally, we establish between them and ourselves a curren t of contrary but analo- gous influence which may subj ect us to them instead of subjecting them to us, as happens frequently enough in those oper ations which have th e sympathy of love for their object. Hence it is highly ess ential to be on our guard while we are attacking, so as not to inspire on the left while we respire on the right. The magi- cal androgyne depicted in the fr ontispiece of the “Ritual” has SOLVE inscribed upon the right and COAGULA on the left arm, thus r ecalling the symbolical archi- tects of the Second Temple, who bore th e sword in one hand and their trowel in the other. While building they had also to defend their work and disperse their enemies. Nature herself does likewise, de stroying and regenerating at the same time. Now, according to th e allegory of Duchentau’s Magical Calendar , man, that"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUM 19 is to say, the initiate, is the ape of Nature, who confines himself by a chain but makes him act unceasingly, imitating th e proceedings and works of his divine mistress and imperishable model. The alternate use of contrary forces, warm th after cold, mildness after severity, love after anger, etc., is the secret of perpetual motion and the permanence of power. Coquettes know this instinctivel y, and hence they make their admirers pass from hope to fear, fr om joy to desponde ncy. To operate always on the same side and in the same mann er is to overweight one basi n of the balance, and com- plete destruction of equilibr ium is a rapid result. Con tinual caressings beget sati- ety, disgust and antipathy, just as constant coldness and severity in the long run alienate and discourage aff ection. An unvarying and ar dent fire in alchemy cal- cines the First Matter and not seldom explodes the Hermetic Vessel: the heat of lime and mineral manure must be substitu ted at regular intervals for the heat of flame. And so also in Magic: works of wrath or severity must be tempered by those of beneficence and love. If the will of the operator be ever at the same ten- sion and directed along the same line, grea t weariness will ensu e, together with a species of moral impotence. Thus, the Magus should not live altoge ther in his laboratory, among his Atha- nors, Elixirs and Pantacles. However riveti ng be the glance of that Circe who is called occult power, we must be able to confront her on occasion with the sword of Ulysses, and resolutely withdraw our lips for a time from the chalice which she offers us. A magical operation should be fo llowed by a rest of equal length and a distraction analogous but contrary in it s object. To strive continually against Nature in order to rule and conquer her is to risk reason and life. Paracelsus dared to do so, but even in the struggle it self he employed equilibrated forces and opposed the intoxication of wine to that of intelligence. So was Paracelsus a man of inspiration and miracles; yet his life was exhausted by this devouring activity, or rather its vestment was ra pidly rent and worn out. But men like Paracelsus use and abuse fearlessly; they know that they can no mo re die than grow old here below. Nothing disposes us towards joy so eff ectually as sorrow; nothing is nearer to sorrow than joy. Hence the uninstructed operator is astounded by attaining the very opposite of his proposed results, because he does not know how to cross or alternate his action. He seeks to bewitc h his enemy but hims elf becomes ill and miserable; he desires to make him-self loved, and is consumed for women who deride him; he ende avours to produce gold, and he exhausts all his resources; his torture is that of Tantalus: ever does the water flow back when he stoops down to drink. The ancients in their symbols and magical operations multiplied the signs of the duad, so that its law of equilibr ium might be remembere d. In their evoca- tions they constructed two altars and i mmolated two victims, one white and one black; the operator, whether male or f emale, holding a sword in one hand and a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"20 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic wand in the other, had one foot shod and the other bared. Moreover, either one or three persons were required for magica l works, because the duad would mean immobility or death in the absence of an equilibrating motor; and when a man and a woman participated in the ceremon y, the operator was always a virgin, a hermaphrodite, or a child. I shall be aske d whether the eccentric ity of these Rites is arbitrary, and whether its one end is th e exercise of the will by the mere multi- plication of difficulties in magical work? I answer that in Magic there is nothing arbitrary, because everything is ruled a nd predetermined by the one and universal dogma of Hermes, that of analogy in the three worlds. Each sign corresponds to an idea and to the special form of an idea; each act expresses a volition corre- sponding to a thought, and formulates the analogies of that th ought and will. The Rites are, therefore, prearranged by the science itself. An uninstructed person who is not acquainted with the threefold power is subject to its mysterious fascination; the sage understands it and ma kes it the instrument of hi s will. When the work is accomplished with exactitude and faith, it is never ineffectual. All magical instruments must be duplic ated; there must be two swords, two wands, two cups, two chafing-dishes, tw o pantacles and two lamps; two vest- ments must be worn, one over the other, and they must be of co ntrasted colours, a rule still followed by Catholic priests; la stly, two metals must be worn at least, or otherwise none. The crown of laurel, rue, mugwort or vervain must be double, in like manner; one of them is used in evoc ations, while the other is burnt, the crack- ling which it makes and the curls of the smoke which it produces being observed as an augury. Nor is such observance vain, for in the magical work all instruments of art are magnetized by th e operator; the air is char ged with his perfumes, the fire which he has consecrated is subject to his will, th e forces of Nature seem to hear and answer him: he reads in all forms the modi fications and complements of his thought. He perceives the water agitated and, as it were, bu bbling of itself, the fire blazing up or going out suddenly, th e leaves of garlands ru stling, the magical rod moving spontaneously and strange, unknown voices passing through the air. It was in such evocations that Julian beheld the beloved phantoms of his dethroned gods, and was appalled at their decrepitude and pallor. I am aware that Christianity has for ever suppressed Ceremonial Magic, and that it proscribes the evocations and sacrifi ces of the old world. It is not therefore our intention to furnish a new basis for their existence by revealing their antique mysteries after the lapse of so many centuries. Even in the order of facts, our experiments have been learned research es and nothing more. We have verified facts that we might appreciate causes, and it has not been our pretension to restore Rites which are for ever destroyed. The orthodoxy of Israel, that religion which is so rational, so divine and so i ll known, condemns no less than Christian- ity the mysteries of Ceremonial Magic. Fr om the standpoint of the tribe of Levi, the exercise of Transcendental Magic must be considered as a usurpation of the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUM 21 priesthood; and the same reason has cau sed the proscription of Operative Magic by every official cultus. To demonstrate the natural foundation of the marvellous and to produce it at will is to annihila te for the vulgar mind that convincing evi- dence from miracles which is claimed by each religion as its exclusive property and its final argument. Respect for establ ished religions, but room also for sci- ence! We have passed, tha nk God, the days of inqui sitions and pyres; unhappy men of learning are no longer murdered on the faith of a few distraught fanatics or hysterical girls. For the rest, let it be understood clearly th at our undertaking is concerned with curious st udies and not with an im possible propaganda. Those who may blame us for daring to term ou rselves Magician h ave nothing to fear from the example, it being wholly improb able that they will ever become sorcer- ers."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"22 CHAPTER III THE TRIANGLE OF PANTACLES T HE Abbot Trithemius, who in Magic wa s the master of Cornelius Agrippa, explains, in his Steganography , the secret of Conjurations and Evocations after a very natural and philosophical manner, thou gh possibly, for that very reason, too simply and too easily. He tells us that to evoke a spirit is to enter into the domi- nant thought of that spir it, and if we raise ourselv es morally higher along the same line, we shall draw the spirit away with us, and it will serve us. To conjure is to oppose the resistance of a current and a chain to an isolated spirit-cum-jurare, to swear together, that is, to make a co mmon act of faith. Th e greater the strength and enthusiasm of this faith, the more ef ficacious is the conjuration. This is why new-born Christianity silen ced the oracles; it alone po ssessed inspiration, it only force. Later on, when St. Pe ter grew old, that is, when the world believed that it had a legal case against the Papacy, the spirit of prophecy came to replace the oracles. Savonarola, Joachim of Flores, John Huss and so many others influenced by turns the minds of men and interpre ted, by lamentations and menaces, the secret anxieties and prot estations of all hearts. We may act individually when evoking a sp irit, but to conjure we must speak in the name of a circle or an association: this is the significance of the hieroglyphical circle inscribed about the Magus who is operating, and out of which he must not pass unless he wishes at the same moment to be stripped of all his power. Let us deal at this point with the vital and pa lmary question, whether the real evocation and real conjuration of spirits are things possible, and whether such possibility can be demonstrated scientifically. To the first pa rt of the question it may be replied out of hand that everything which is not an evident im possibility can and must be admitted provisional ly. As to the second part, we affirm that in virtue of the Great Magical Dogma of the hierarchy and of universal analogy, the kabalistic possibility of real evocat ions can be demonstrated; concerning the phenomenal reality consequent upon magical operations accomplished with sincerity, this is a matter of experience. As already narrated, we have established it in our own per- sons, and by means of this “Ritual” we shall place ou r readers in a position to renew and confirm our experiences. Nothing perishes in Nature; whatsoever has lived goes on liv ing, always under new forms; but even the anterior forms are not destroyed, since they remain in our memory. Do we not still see in imaginati on the child whom we once knew, though now he is an old man? The very traces which we believe to be effaced from our memory are not in reality blotted out, for a fortuitous circumstance may evoke and recall them. But after what manner do we see them? As we have already said, it is in the Astral Light, which transmi ts them to our brai n by the mechanism of the nervous system. On the other hand, all forms are proportional and analogical"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE TRIANGLE OF PANTACLES 23 to the idea which has determined them; th ey are the natural character, the signa- ture of that idea, as the Magi term it, and so soon as the idea is ev oked actively the form is realized and bodied forth. Schroe pffer, the famous il lumine of Leipzig, terrified all Germany with his evocations, and his audacity in magical experi- ments was so great that his reputatio n became an insupportable burden. He allowed himself to be carried away by the immense current of hallucinations which he had produced; the visions of th e other world disgus ted him with this, and he killed himself. His st ory should be a warning to those who are fascinated by Ceremonial Magic. Nature is not outr aged with impunity, and no one can play safely with unknown a nd incalculable forces. It is th is consideration which has led and will ever lead us to deny the vain curiosity of those wh o would see in order that they may believe, and we reply to them in the same words as we replied to an eminent Englishman who thre atened us with his scep ticism: “You are perfectly within your right in refusing to believe: for our own part , it will not make us more discouraged or less convinced.” To those who may assure us that they have scru- pulously and boldly fulfilled all the Rites and that th ere has been no result, we would recommend that they should stay thei r hand, as it is po ssibly a warning of Nature, who will not lend herself to them for these anomalous works; but if they persist in their curiosity, they have only to start afresh. The triad, being the foundation of magical doctrine must be necessarily observed in evocations; for it is the sy mbolical number of re alization and effect. The letter e\u0001 is commonly traced upon kabalistic pantacles which have the fulfil- ment of a desire for their object. It is also the sign of the scapegoat in mystic Kabalah, and Saint-Martin observes that inserted in the In communicable Tetra- gram it forms the Name of the Redeemer. It is this which th e mystagogues of the Middle Ages represented in their nocturnal assemblies by the exhibition of a sym- bolical goat, carrying a lighte d torch between its two horn s. In the fifteenth chap- ter of this “Ritual” we sh all describe the allegorical forms and strange cultus of this monstrous animal, which represented Nature doomed to anathema but ran- somed by the sign of light. The Gnosti c Agapae and pagan pr iapic orgies which followed in its honour sufficiently re vealed the moral consequence which the adepts drew from the exhib ition. All this will be explained, together with the Rites, decried and now regarded as fabulo us, of the Great Sabbath and of Black Magic. Within the grand circle of evocations a triangle was usually traced, and the side towards which the upper point should be di rected was a matter for careful obser- vation. If the spirit were su pposed to be from heaven, the operator placed himself at the top, and set the alta r of fumigations at the bott om; but if the spirit came from the abyss this method was reversed. Moreover, the sacred symbol of two interlaced triangles, forming the six-poin ted star, known in m agic as the Pantacle or Seal of Solomon, must be worn upon the forehead and the breast, and graven"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"24 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic in the right hand. I ndependently of these signs, the ancients, in their evocations, made use of those mystical combinations of Divine Names which we have repro- duced in our “Doctrine” from the Hebrew Kabalists. The magic triangle of pagan theosophists was the celebrated ABR ACADABRA, to which they attributed extraordinary virtues and represented as follows: ABRACADABRA ABRACADABR ABRACADAB ABRACADA ABRACAD ABRACA ABRAC ABRA ABR AB A This combination of letters is a key of the Pentagram. The initial A is repeated five and reproduced thirty times, thus gi ving the elements an d numbers of the two following figures: The isolated A represents the unity of the first principle, otherwise, the intellec- tual or active agent. A unite d to B represents the fertil ization of the duad by the monad.

The number 11 , which is that of the letters of the word, combines th e unity of the initia te with the denary of Pythagoras, and the number 66 , the added total of all the letters, form kabalis- tically the number 12 , which is the square of the triad and consequently the mystic quadrature of the circle. We may remark, in passing, that the author of the Apoc- alypse, that key of the Christian Kabalah, composed the number of the beast, that is to say, of idolatry, by adding a 6 to the double senary of ABRACADABRA , which gives 18 kabalistically, the number attributed in the Tarot to the hieroglyphic sign of night and of the profane – the moon, to gether with the towe rs, dog, wolf and crab – a mysterious and obscure numbe r, the kabalistic key of which is 9 , the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE TRIANGLE OF PANTACLES 25 number of initiation. On this subject the sacred Kabalist says expressly: “He that hath understanding” th at is, the key of kabalistic numbers – “let him count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred three score and six.” It is, in fact, the decade of Pyth agoras multiplied by itself and added to the sum of th e triangular Pantacle of ABRACADABRA : it is thus the sum of all Magic in the an cient world, the entire pr ogramme of human genius, which the Divine Genius of the Gospel sought to absorb or transplant. These hieroglyphical combinations of lett ers and numbers belong to the practi- cal part of the Kabalah, which, from this point of view, is divided into GEMATRIA and THEMURA . Such calculations, which now se em to us arbitrary or devoid of interest, belonged then to the philosop hical symbolism of the East, and were of the highest importance in the teaching of holy things emanating from the occult sciences. The absolute kabalistic alphab et, which connected primitive ideas with allegories, allegories with letters, and letters with numb ers, was then called the Keys of Solomon. We have stated alread y that these Keys, preserved to our own day, but wholly misconstrued, are noth ing else than the game of Tarot, the antique allegories of which were remarked and appreciated for the first time in the modern world by the learned archaeologist, Court de Gebelin. The double triangle of Solomon is expl ained by St. John in a remarkable man- ner. He says, “There are three which give record in heaven – the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit”; and “there are thr ee which give testim ony on earth – the spirit, the water and the blood.” Thus, St. John agrees with the masters of Her- metic philosophy, who attribut e to their Sulphur the name of Ether, to their Mer- cury that of Philosophical Water, and to their Salt the qua lification of the Dragon's Blood or Menstruum of the Earth. Blood or Salt corresponds by opposi- tion with the Father, Azotic or Mercurial Water with the Word or LOGOS , and the Ether with the Holy Spirit. But the things of transcen dent symbolism can only be understood rightly by the tr ue children of science. The threefold repetition of names with varied intonations were united to trian- gular combinations in magical ceremoni es. The Magic Wand was frequently sur- mounted with a small magnetized fork, wh ich Paracelsus replac ed by the trident represented below."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"26 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic This trident is a pantacle expressing the synthesis of the triad in the monad, thus completing the sacred tetrad. He ascr ibed to this figure all the virtues which kabalistic Hebrews attribute to the name of Jehovah and the thaumaturgic prop- erties of the ABRACADABRA , used by the hierophants of Alexandria. Let us recog- nize here that it is a pantac le and consequently a concre te and an absolute sign of an entire doctrine, which ha s been that of an immen se magnetic circle, not only for ancient philosophers but also for adepts of the Mi ddle Ages. The restoration in our own day of its original value by the comprehension of its mysteries, might not that also restore all its miraculous vi rtue and all its power against human dis- eases? The old sorceresses, when they spent th e night at the meeting-place of three cross-roads, yelled three times in honour of triple Hecate. All these figures, with the acts analogous thereto, all these di spositions of numbers and of characters, are, as we have said, so many instruments for the educ ation of the will, by fixing and determining its habits. They serve, furthermore, to combine all powers of the human soul in action and to increase the creative force of imagination. It is the gymnastics of thought in trai ning for realization: and hence the effect of these practices is infallible, like Nature, when th ey are fulfilled with absolute confidence and indomitable perseverance. The Great Master tells us that faith could trans- plant trees into the sea and remove mount ains. Even a superstitious and insensate practice is efficacious becau se it is a realization of will. Hence a prayer is more powerful if we visit a church to say it than when it is recited at home, and it will work miracles if we fare to a famous sanctuary for the purpose-in other words, to one which is magnetized strongly by th e great number of its frequenters--travers- ing two or three hundred leagues with bare feet and asking alms by the way. Men laugh at the simple woman who denies h erself a pennyworth of milk in the morn- ing that she may carry a penny taper to burn on the m agic triangle in a chapel; but they who laugh are ignorant, and th e simple woman does not pay too dearly for what she thus purchases of resignation and of courage. Great minds pass by in great pride, shrugging their shoulders; th ey rise up against superstition with a din which shakes the world; and what happe ns? The towers of great minds collapse, and their ruins revert to the providers and purchasers of penny tapers, who are content to hear it proclai med everywhere that their re ign is for ever ended, pro- vided that they rule always. The great religions have never had more than one serious rival, and this rival is Magic. Magic produced the occult associ ations which brought about the revolu- tion termed the Renaissanc e; but it has been the doom of the human mind, blinded by insensate passions, to realize literally the allegorical history of the Hebrew Hercules: by over-throwing the p illars of the temple, it has been buried itself under the ruins.

The spirit toils everywhere and fructifies matter by life ; all matter is animated; thought and soul are everywhere. By possessing ourselves of the thought which produces diverse forms we become masters of forms and make them serve our purposes. The Astral Light is saturated with such souls, whic h it disengages in the unceasing genera- tion of beings. These so uls have imperfec t wills, which can be governed and employed by wills more powerful; then mighty invisible chains form and may occasion or determine great elementary commotions. The phenomena established by the criminal trials of M agic, and quite recently by M. Eudes de Mirville, have no other cause. Elementary spirits are li ke children: they torment chiefly those who trouble about them, unless indeed they are controlled by high reason and great severity. We designate such spirit s under the name of oc cult elements, and it is these who frequently occasion our bi zarre or disturbing dreams, who produce the movements of the divini ng rod and rappings upon wa lls or furniture; but they can manifest no thought other than our own, and when we ar e not thinking, they speak to us with all the incoherence of dreams. They reproduce good and evil indifferently, for they are without free will and are hence irresponsible; they exhibit themselves to ecsta tics and somnambulists und er incomplete and fugitive forms. This explains the nigh tmares of St. Anthony and most probably the visions of Swedenborg. Such creatures are neither damned nor guilty; they are curious and innocent. We may use or abuse them like animals or children. Therefore the Magus who makes use of them assumes a terr ible responsibility, for he must expi- ate all the evil which he causes them to a ccomplish, and the extent of his punish- ment will be in proportion to that of the power whic h he may have exercised by their mediation. To govern elementary spirits and thus b ecome king of the occult elements, we must first have undergone the four ordeal s of ancient initiations; and seeing that such initiations exist no longer, we mu st have substituted analogous experiences, such as exposing ourselves boldly in a fire, crossing an abyss by means of the trunk of a tree or a pl ank, scaling a perpendicu lar mountain during a storm, swimming through a dangerous whirlpool or cataract. A man who is timid in the water will never reign over th e Undines; one who is afra id of fire will never com- mand Salamanders; so long as we are liab le to giddiness we mu st leave the Sylphs in peace and forbear from irritating Gnomes ; for inferior spirits will only obey a power which has overcome them in their own element.

We se e by the occult versicle of the Lord's Prayer, which we have cited in our “Doctrine”, that it wa s originally made after two manners, or at least that it was characterized by two enti rely different formulae, one reserved for priests and initiates, the ot her imparted to neophytes and the profane. For exam- ple, the initiate said raising his hand to his forehead, “For thine,” then added “is,” and continuing as he brought down his hand to his breast, “the kingdom,” then to the left shoulder, “the justice,” afterwards to the right shoulder, “and the mercy” – then clasping his hands, he added, “in the generating ages.” Tibi sunt Malkuth et Geburah et Chesed per aeonas – a Sign of the Cross which is abso- lutely and magnificently kabalistic, wh ich the profanations of Gnosticism have lost completely to the official and mi litant Church. This Sign, made after this manner, should precede and termin ate the Conjuration of the Four. To overcome and subjugate the elementary spirits, we must never yield to their characteristic defect s.

But we must be prompt and active , like the Sylphs; pl iant and attentive to images, like the Undines; energetic and strong like the Salamanders; laborious and patient, like the Gnomes: in a word, we must overcome them in their strength without ever being overcome by their wea knesses. Once we are well established in this disposition, the whole world will be at the service of the wise operator. He will pass through the storm, and the rain will not moisten his head; the wind will not move even a fold of his garments; he wi ll go through fire and not be burned; he will walk upon water and will behold di amonds within the crust of the earth. These promises may appear hyperbolic, but only to vulgar understanding, for if the sage do not perform such things mat erially and actually, he accomplishes oth- ers which are much greater and more admira ble. At the same ti me, it is indubita- ble that we may direct the elements by our will up to a certain point and can really change or hinder thei r effects. For example, if it be established that persons in an ecstatic state lose their weight for the time being, why should it be impossi- ble to walk upon the water? The convulsi onaries of Saint Medard felt neither fire nor steel, and begged for the most violent blows and incred ible tortures as a relief. The extraordinary climbings and miraculo us equilibrium of some somnambulists are a revelation of these concealed forces of Nature. But we live in a century when no one has the courage to confess the wo nders that he has witnessed, and did any- one say: “I have myself beheld or perfo rmed the things which I am describing,” he would be answered: “You are diverting you rself at our expen se, or otherwise you are ill.” It is far better to be silent and to act. The metals which correspond to the four elementary forms are gold and silver for the air, mercury for water, iron and copper for fire, lead for earth. Talismans are composed from these, relative to the forces which they signify and to the effects which it is designed to obtain from them. Divination by the four elemen- tary forms, respectively known as ae romancy, hydromancy, pyromancy and geo- mancy, is performed after various manners, which al l depend on the will and the TRANSLUCID or imagination of th e operator. In fact, th e four elements are only instruments which assist second sight. Now, second sight is the faculty of seeing in the Astral Light, and it is as natural as the first or sensible an d ordinary sight, but it can operate only by abstraction of the senses. Somnambulists and ecstatics enjoy second sight naturally, but this sigh t is more lucid when the abstraction is more complete. Abstraction is produced by astral intoxication, that is, by an excess of light which completely saturat es, and hence stupefie s, the nervous sys- tem. Sanguine temperaments are disposed to Aeromancy, the bilious to pyromancy, the phlegmatic to hydromancy and the melancholic to geomancy. Aeromancy is confirmed by oneiromancy, or divination by dreams; pyroma ncy is supplemented by magnetism; hydromancy by crystallo mancy; and geomancy by cartomancy. These are transpositions a nd complements of methods. But divination, however"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"34 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic operated, is dangerous, or to say the least useless, for it dishea rtens will, as a con- sequence impedes liberty a nd tires the nervous system."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"35 CHAPTER V THE BLAZING PENTAGRAM W E proceed to the explanation and consec ration of the Sacred and Mysterious Pentagram. At this point, let the ignorant and superstitious close the book; they will either see nothing but darkness, or they will be scandalized. The Pentagram, which in Gnostic schools is called the Blazing Star, is the sign of intellectual omnipotence and autocracy. It is the Star of the Magi; it is the sign of the Word made flesh; and, according to the direct ion of its points, this absolute magical symbol represents order or confusion, th e Divine Lamb of Ormuz and St. John, or the accursed goat of Mendes. It is initiation or profanatio n; it is Lucifer or Vesper, the star of morning or evenin g. It is Mary or Lilith, vi ctory or death, day or night. The Pentagram with two points in the ascendant represents Satan as the goat of the Sabbath; when one point is in the ascenda nt, it is the sign of the Saviour. The Pentagram is the figure of the human bo dy, having the four limbs and a single point representing the head. A human fi gure head downwards naturally repre- sents a demon that is, intellectual subve rsion, disorder or madness. Now, if Magic be a reality, if occult science be really th e true law of the three worlds, this abso- lute sign, this sign ancien t as history and more ancient, should and does exercise an incalculable influence upon spirits set free from their material envelope. The sign of the Pentagram is called th e Sign of the Microcosm, and it repre- sents what the Kabalists of the book Zo har term the Microprosopus. The complete comprehension of the Pentagram is the key of the two worlds. It is absolute phi- losophy and natural science. The sign of the Pentagram should be composed of the seven metals, or at least traced in pure gold upon white marble. It may be also drawn with vermilion on an unblemished lambskin the symbol of integrity and light. The marble should be virgin, that is, should never have been used for another purpose; the lambskin should be prepared under the auspices of the sun. The lamb must have been slain at Pa schal time with a ne w knife, and the skin must be salted with salt consecrated by magical operations. The omission of even one of these difficult and apparently ar bitrary ceremonies makes void the entire success of the grea t works of science. The Pentagram is consecrated with the four elements; the magical figure is breathed on five times; it is sprinkled with holy water; it is dried by the smoke of five perfumes, namely, incense, myrrh, al oes, sulphur and camphor, to which a little white resin and ambe rgris may be added. The fi ve breathings are accompa- nied by the utterance of names attribut ed to the five genii, who are Gabriel, Raphael, Anael, Samael and Oriphiel. Aft erwards the Pentacle is placed succes- sively at the north, south, east, west and centre of the astronomical cross, pro- nouncing at the same time, one after an other, the consonants of the Sacred"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"36 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic Tetragram, and then, in an unde rtone, the blessed letters A LEPH and the mysteri- ous T AU , united in the kabalistic name of A Z OTH . The Pentagram should be placed upon the altar of perfum es and under the tri- pod of evocations. The operator should wear the sign also as we ll as that of the Macrocosm, which is composed of two cr ossed and superposed triangles. When a spirit of light is evoked, the head of the st ar – that is, one of its points – should be directed towards the tripod of evocations and the two inferior points towards the altar of perfumes. In the case of a spirit of darkne ss, the opposite course is pur- sued, but then the operator must be careful to set the end of the rod or the point of the sword upon the head of the Pentagram. We have said that signs are the active voice of the word of will. Now, the word of will must be give n in its completeness, so that it may be transformed into actio n; and a single negligence, representing an idle speech or a doubt, falsifies and paralyses the whole process, turning back upon the operator all the forces thus expe nded in vain. We must therefore abstain absolutely from magical ceremonies or scr upulously and exactl y fulfil them all. The Pentagram, engraved in luminous lines upon gl ass by the electrical machine, exercises also a great influen ce upon spirits and t errifies phantoms. The old magicians traced the si gn of the Pentagram upon their doorsteps, to prevent evil spirits from entering and good spirit s from departing. This constraint fol- lowed from the direction of the points of the star. Two points on the outer side drove away the evil; two points on the i nner side imprisoned them; one only on the inner side held good sp irits captive. All these magi cal theories, based upon the one dogma of Hermes and on the analogical deductions of science, have been con- firmed invariably by the vi sions of ecstatics and the paroxysms of cataleptics, declaring that they are possessed by spir its. The G which Freemasons place in the middle of the Blazing Star signifies G NOSIS and G ENERATION , the two sacred words of the ancient Kabalah. It signifies also G RAND A RCHITECT , for the Penta- gram on every side represents an A. By placing it in su ch a manner that two of its points are in the ascendant and one is below, we may see the horns, ears and beard of the hierarchic Goat of Mendes, when it becomes the sign of infernal evo- cations. The allegorical Star of th e Magi is no other than the mysterious Pentagram; and those three kings, sons of Zoroaster, conducted by the Blazing Star to the cra- dle of the microcosmic God, are themselv es a full demonstration of the kabalistic and magical beginnings of Christian do c-trine. One of these kings is white, another black and the third brown. The wh ite king offers gold, symbol of light and life; the black king presents myrrh, image of death and of darkness; the brown king sacrifices incense, emblem of th e conciliating doctrine of the two prin- ciples. They return thereafter into their own land by another r oad, to show that a new cultus is only a new pa th, conducting man to one re ligion, being that of the sacred triad and the radiant Pentagram, th e sole eternal catholicism. St. John, in"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE BLAZING PENTAGRAM 37 the Apocalypse, beholds this same star fall from heaven to earth. It is then called absinthe or wormwood, and all the waters of the sea become bitter – a striking image of the materializatio n of dogma, which produces fanaticism and the acridi- ties of controversy. Then unto Christianity itself m ay be applied those words of Isaiah: “How has thou fallen from heaven, bright star, which wast so splendid in thy prime!” But the Pentagr am, profaned by men, burns ever unclouded in the right hand of the Word of Truth, and the inspired voice guarantees to him that overcometh the possession of the Morning St ar – a solemn promise of restitution held out to the Star of Lucifer. As will be seen, all Mysterie s of Magic, all symbols of the Gnosis, all figures of occultism, all kabalistic keys of prophecy are summed up in the Sign of the Penta- gram, which Paracelsus proclaims to be th e greatest and most potent of all signs. Need anyone be surprised therefore that every Magus believes in the real influence exercised by this sign over spirits of al l hierarchies? Those wh o set at naught the Sign of the Cross tremble before the Star of the Microcosm. On the contrary, when conscious of failing will, the Magus turns his eyes towards this symbol, takes it in his right hand and feels armed with intell ectual omnipotence, provided that he is truly a king, worthy to be le d by the star to the cradle of divine realization; pro- vided that he K NOWS , D ARES , W ILLS and K EEPS S ILENT ; provided that he is famil- iar with the usages of the Pentacle, the Cup, the Wand and the Sword; provided, finally, that the intrepid gaze of his soul corresponds to tho se two eyes which the ascending point of our Pentagram ever presents open."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"38 CHAPTER VI THE MEDIUM AND MEDIATOR T WO things, as we have show n, are necessary for the ac quisition of magical power – the emancipation of will from servitude and its instruction in the art of domina- tion. The sovereign will is represented in our symbols by the Woman who crushes the serpent's head and by the radiant angel who restrains and constrains the dragon with lance and heel. In this plac e let us affirm without evasion that the Great Magical Agent – the doubl e current of light, the livin g and astral fire of the earth – was represented by the serpent with the head of an ox, goat or dog, in ancient theogonies. It is th e dual serpent of the caduceus, the old serpent of Gene- sis, but it is also the brazen serpent of Moses, twined about the Tau, that is, the generating lingam. It is, moreover, the Goat of the Sabbat h and the Baphomet of the Templars; it is the Hyle of the Gnos tics; it is the double tail of the serpent which forms the legs of the solar cock of Abraxas. In fi ne, it is the devil of M. Eudes de Mirville and is re ally that blind force which souls must overcome if they would be freed from the chains of eart h; for, unless their will can detach them from this fatal attraction, th ey will be absorbed in th e current by the force which produced them, and will retu rn to the central and eter nal fire. The whole magical work consists therefore in our liberation from the folds of the ancient serpent, then in setting foot upon it s head and leading it where we will. “I will give thee all the kingdoms of the earth, if thou wilt fall down and adore me,” said this serpent in the evangelical mythos. The initiate sh ould make answer: “I will not kneel to thee, but thou shalt crouch at my feet; no thing shalt thou give me, but I will make use of thee, and will take that which I need, for I am thy lord and master” – a reply which, in a veiled manner, is contained in that of the Saviour. We have said that there is no personal de vil. It is a misdirected force, as the name indicates. An odic or magnetic current, formed by a chain of perverse wills, constitutes this evil spirit, which the Gospel calls legion , and this it is which pre- cipitated the swine into the sea – anothe r allegory of the attraction exercised on beings of inferior instinct s by blind forces that can be put in operation by error and evil will. This symbol may be compar ed with that of th e comrades of Ulysses transformed into swine by the sorceress Ci rce. Remark what wa s done by Ulysses to preserve himself and deliver his associ ates: he refused the cup of the enchant- ress and commanded her with the sword. Circe is Nature, with all her delights and allurements: we must overcome her in or der to enjoy. Such is the significance of the Homeric fable, for the poems of Homer, those true sacred books of ancient Hellas, contain all the mysteries of high Eastern initiation. The natural medium is therefore the ever active and ever seducing serpent of idle wills, which we must withstand by continual subjugation. Amorous, glutton- ous, passionate, or idle m agicians are impossible mons trosities. The Magus thinks"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE MEDIUM AND MEDIATOR 39 and wills; he loves nothing with desire; he reject s nothing in passion. The latter word signifies a passive state, and the M agus is invariably active, invariably victo- rious. The attainment of th is realization is the crux of the transcendent sciences: so when the Magus accomplishes his own creation, the Great work is fulfilled, at least as concerns cause and instrument. The Great Agent or natural mediator of human omnipotence cannot be overcome or directed save by an extra-natural mediator, which is an emancipated will. Archimedes postulated a fulcrum outside the world in order to raise the world. Th e fulcrum of the Magu s is the intellectual cubic stone, the Philosophical Stone of A Z OTH – that is, the doctrine of absolute reason and universal harmonies by the sympathy of contraries. One of our most fert ile writers, and one of those who are least fixed in their ideas, M. Eugene Sue, has founded a vast romance-epic upon an individuality whom he strives to render odious, who b ecomes interesting against the will of the novelist, so abundantly does he gift hi m with patience, audacity, intelligence and genius. We are in the presenc e of a kind of Sixtus V – poor, temperate, passionless, holding the entire world entangled in th e web of his skilful combinations. This man excites at will the pa ssions of his enemies, destroys them by means of one another, invariably reaches the point of view, and this without noise, without ostentation and without imposture. His ob ject is to free the world of a society which the author of the bo ok believes to be danger ous and malignant, and to attain it no cost is too gr eat. Rodin is ill lodged, ill clothed, nourished like the refuse of humanity, but ever fixed upon hi s work. Consistently with his intention, the author depicts him as wretched, filt hy, hideous, repulsive to the touch and horrible to the sight. But suppo sing this very exterior is a means of disguising the enterprise and so of more surely attaining it, is it not proof positive of sublime courage? When Rodin becomes pope, do you think that he will be ill clothed and dirty? Hence M. Eugene Sue has missed his point; hi s object was to deride super- stition and fanaticism, but th at which he attacks is inte lligence, strength, genius, the most signal human virtues. Were th ere many more Rodins among the Jesuits, were there one even, I would not give mu ch for the success of the opposite party, in spite of the brilliant a nd maladroit special pleadings of its illustrious advocates. To will well, to will long, to will always, but never to lust after anyt hing, such is the secret of power, and th is is the Magical Arcanum which Tasso brings forward in the persons of the two knights who come to deliver Rinaldo and to destroy the enchantments of Armida. They withstand equally the most alluring nymphs and most terrible wild beasts. They remain without desires and without fear, and hence they attain their end. Does it follow from this th at a true magician inspires more fear than love? I do not deny it, and while recognizing abundantly how sweet are the attractions of life, while doing full justi ce to the gracious genius of Anacreon and to all the youthful efflorescen ce of the poetry of love, I invite the estimable votaries of pleasure to regard the transcendental sciences merely as a"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"40 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic matter of curiosity and nev er to approach the magical tripod: the great works of science are mortal to sense-enjoyment. The man who has escaped from the chain of instincts will first of all realize his omnipotence by the obedience of animals. The history of Daniel in the lions den is no fable, and more than once, during the persecutions of infant Christianity, this phenomenon recurred in the presence of the whole Roman people. A man seldom has anything to fear from an animal of which he is not afraid. The bullets of Jules Gerard, the lion-killer, are magical and intelligent. Only once did he run a real danger; he allowed a timid companion to accompany him, and, looking upon this imprudent person as lost beforehand, he also was afraid, not for himself but for his comrade. Many persons wi ll say that it is difficult and even impossible to attain such resolution, that strength in volition and energy in character are natu- ral gifts. I do not disput e it, but I would point out also that habit can reform nature; volition can be perfect ed by education, and, as intimated otherwise, all magical, like all religious, ceremonial has no other end but thus to test, exercise and habituate the will by perseverance and by force. The more difficult and labo- rious the exercises, the grea ter their effect, as we h ave now advanced far enough to see. If it have been hitherto impossible to direct the phe nomena of magnetism, it is because an initiated and tr uly emancipated operator has not yet appeared. Who can boast that he is such ? Have we not ever new self -conquests to make? At the same time, it is certain that Nature wi ll obey the sign a nd word of one who is strong enough to be convince d that she will. I say that Nature will obey; I do not say that she will beli e herself or disturb the order of her possibilities. The healing of nervous diseases by word , breath, or contact; resu rrection in certain cases; resistance of evil wills sufficient to di sarm and confound murderers; even the fac- ulty of making one's self invisible by confusing the sight of those whom it is important to elude – all this is a natural effect of pr ojecting or withdrawing the Astral Light. Thus was Valentius dazzled and terror-struck on entering the temple of Cesarea, even as Heliodorus of old, overwhelmed by a s udden madness in the temple of Jerusalem, believed himself scourged and trampled by angels. Thus also the Admiral de Coligny imposed respect on his assassins and could only be des- patched by a madman who fell upon him with averted face. What rendered Joan of Arc invariably victorious was the fascin ation of her faith a nd the miracle of her audacity; she paralysed the arms of those who would have assailed her, and the English may have very well b een sincere in regarding he r as a witch or a sorceress. As a fact, she was a sorceress unconscious ly, herself believing that she acted supernaturally, while she was really dispos ing of an occult force which is universal and invariably governed by the same laws. The Magus-magnetizer should have co mmand of the natural medium, and consequently of that astr al body by which our so ul communicates with our"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE MEDIUM AND MEDIATOR 41 organs. He must say to the material bo dy, “Sleep!” and to the sidereal body, “Dream!” Thereupon, the aspect of visibl e things changes, as in hashish-visions. Cagliostro is thought to have possessed this power, and he increased its action by means of fumigations and perfumes; but tr ue magnetic abilit y should transcend these auxiliaries, all more or less inimical to reason and destructive of health? M. Ragon, in his learned work on Occult Masonry, gives the recipe for a series of medicaments calculated to induce the exaltation of somnambulism. It is by no means a knowledge to be d espised, but prudent magist s should avoid its practice. The Astral Light is projec ted by glance, by voice, and by the thumb and palm of the hand. Music is a po tent auxiliary of the voice, and hence comes the word enchantment. No musical instrument is more bewitching than the human voice, but the far-away notes of a violin or harmonica may augment its power. The patient whom it is proposed to subjugate is prepared in this way; and when he is half-stupefied, as it were, enveloped by the charm, the hands should be extended towards him; he should be commanded to sl eep or to see, and he will obey despite himself. Should he resist, a fixed glance must be directed towards him, one thumb placed between his eyes and the other on hi s breast, so touching him lightly with a single and swift contact; the breath mu st be slowly drawn in and again breathed gently and warmly forth, repeating in a low voi ce, “Sleep!” or “See!”"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"42 CHAPTER VII THE SEPTENARY OF TALISMANS C EREMONIES , vestments, perfumes, characters and figures being, as we have stated, necessary to apply imagination to the education of the will, the success of magical works depends upon th e faithful observation of a ll the Rites, which are in no sense fantastic or arbitrary. They have been transmitted to us by antiquity and obtain permanently by the essential laws of analogical realization and of the cor- respondence which interbinds ideas and forms. Having spent many years in con- sulting and comparing all th e most authentic Grimoire s and magical Rituals, we have succeeded, not without labour, in r econstituting the Ceremonial of universal and primeval Magic. The only serious b ooks which we have see n upon this subject are in manuscript, written in convention al characters which we have deciphered by the help of the Polygraphy of Trithemius. The importance of others consists wholly in the hieroglyphs and symbols wh ich adorn them, the truth of the images being disguised under the su perstitious fictions of a mystifying text. Such, for example, is the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III, which has never been printed with its true figures, and we have reconstructed it for our own use after an ancient manu- script. The Rituals kno wn under the name of Clavicles Of Solomon are very numerous. Many have been printed, whil e others remain in manuscripts, tran- scribed with great care. An exceedingly fine and elegan tly written example is pre- served in the Imperial Libr ary; it is enriched with Pantacles and characters, most of which have been reprod uced in the Magical Cale ndars of Tycho Brahe and Duchentau. Lastly, there are printed Cl avicles and Grimoires which are catch- penny mystifications and impo stures of dishonest publish ers. The book so notori- ous and decried formerly under the name of Little Albert belongs mainly to the latter category: some talismanic figures, and some calculations borrowed from Paracelsus, are its only serious parts. In any matter of Realizat ion and Ritual, Paracelsus is an imposing magical authority. No one has accomplished works gr eater than his, and for that very rea- son he conceals the virtue of ceremonies and merely teaches in his occult philoso- phy the existence of that magnetic agent which is omnipoten ce of will; he sums also the whole science of characters in two signs, the macrocosmic and microcos- mic stars. It was sufficient for the adepts, and it was important not to initiate the vulgar. Paracelsus therefore did not teac h the Ritual, but he practised, and his practice was a sequ ence of miracles. We have spoken of the m agical importance of the tr iad and tetrad. Their com- bination constitutes the great religiou s and kabalistic number which represents the universal synthesis and comprises the sa cred septenary. In the belief of the ancients, the world is govern ed by seven secondary causes – secundii, as Trithe- mius calls them – which are the universal forces designated by Moses under the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE SEPTENARY OF TALISMANS 43 plural name of Eloim, god s. These forces, analogous and contrary to one another, produce equilibrium by their contrasts and rule the movement of the spheres. The Hebrews termed them the seven great ar changels, giving them the names of Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Anael, Samael , Zadkiel and Oriphiel. The Christian Gnostics named the four last Uriel, Barachie l, Sealtiel and Jehud iel. Other nations attributed to these spirits the government of the seven chief planets, and assigned to them the names of their chief divinities. All believed in their relative influence; astronomy divided the antique heaven be tween them and allotted the seven days of the week to their successive rule. Such is the reason of the various Ceremonies of the magical week and th e septenary cultus of the planets. We have observed previously that in this sense the planet s are only signs; they have the influence which universal faith attributes because th ey are more truly the stars of the human mind than the orbs of heaven. The sun, which Antique Magic always regarded as fixed, could be only a planet for the vulgar; hence it represents that day of rest in the week which we t erm Sunday without knowi ng why, the day of the sun among the ancients. The seven magical planets correspond to the seven colours of the spectrum and the seven notes of the musical octave; they represent also the seven virtues and by contrast the seven vices of Christian ethics. The seven sacraments correspond equally to this great universal septenary . Baptism, which co nsecrates the element of water, is in analogy with the Moon; ascetic Penance is under the auspices of Samael, the angel of Mars; Confirmation , which imparts the spirit of understand- ing and communicates to the true believer the gift of tongues, is under the aus- pices of Raphael, the angel of Mercury; the Eucharist substitutes sacramental realization of God made man for the empire of Jupiter; Marriage is consecrated by the angel Anael, the purifyi ng genius of Venus; Extr eme Unction is the safe-guard of the sick about to fall under the scythe of Saturn; an d Orders, consecrating the priesthood of light, is marked more esp ecially by the char acters of the Sun. Almost all these analogies we re observed by the learned Dupuis, who thence con- cluded that all religions were false, inst ead of recognizing the sanctity and perpe- tuity of a single dogma, ever reproduced in the universal symbolism of successive religious forms. He failed to understa nd the permanent revelation transmitted to human genius by the harmonies of Nature, and beheld only a catalogue of errors in this chain of speaking images and eternal truths. Magical works are also seven in number: ( 1 ) works of light and riches, under the auspices of the Sun; ( 2 ) works of divination and mystery, under the invocation of the Moon; ( 3 ) works of skill, science and el oquence, under the protection of Mercury; ( 4 ) works of wrath and chastisemen t, consecrated to Mars; ( 5 ) works of love, favoured by Venus; ( 6 ) works of ambition and in trigue, under the influence of Jupiter; ( 7 ) works of malediction and death, under the patronage of Saturn. In theological symbolism, the Sun represents the Word of Truth; the Moon, religion"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"44 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic itself; Mercury, the interpretation and sc ience of myst eries; Mars, ju stice; Venus, mercy and love; Jupiter, the risen and glor ious Saviour; Saturn, God the Father, or the Jehovah of Moses. In the human body, the Sun is analogous to the heart, the Moon to the brain, Jupiter to the right hand, Saturn to the left, Mars to the left foot, Venus to the right, Mercury to th e generative organs, whence an androgyne figure is sometimes attributed to this planet. In the human face, the Sun governs the forehead, Jupiter the right and Satu rn the left eye; th e Moon rules between both at the root of the nose, the two alae of whic h are governed by Mars and Venus; finally, the influence of Mercury is exercised over mouth and chin. Among the ancients these notions constituted the occult sci ence of physiognomy, after- wards recovered imperfectly by Lavater. The Magus who intends undert aking the works of light must operate on a Sun- day, from midnight to eight in the morning, or from three in the afternoon to ten in the evening. He should wear a purpl e vestment, with ti ara and bracelets of gold. The altar of perfumes and the tripod of sacred fire must be encircled by wreaths of laurel, heliotro pe and sunflowers; the perfumes are cinnamon, strong incense, saffron and red sandal; the ring must be of gold, with a chrysolith or ruby; the carpet must be of lion-skins, the fans of sparrow-hawk feathers. On Monday the robe is white, embroidered with silver, a nd having a triple collar of pearls, crystals and selenite; the tiara mu st be covered with yellow silk, embla- zoned with silver characters forming the Hebrew monogram of Gabriel, as given in the Occult Philosophy of Agrippa; the perfumes are white sandal, camphor, amber, aloes and pulverized seed of cu cumber; the wreaths are mugwort, moon- wort and yellow ranun-culus es. Tapestries, garments and objects of a black colour must be avoided; and no metal except si lver should be worn on the person. On Tuesday, a day for the operatio ns of vengeance, the colo ur of the vestment should be that of flame, rust or blood, with belt and bracelet s of steel. The tiara must be bound with gold; the wand must not be used, but only the magical dagger and sword; the wreaths must be of absinthe and rue, the ring of steel, with an ame- thyst for precious stone. On Wednesday , a day favourable for transcendent sci- ence, the vestment should be green, or sh ot with various colours; the necklace of pearls in hollow glass beads containing mercury; the perfumes benzoin, mace and storax; the flowers, narcis sus, lily, herb-mercury, fu mitory, and marjoram; the jewel should be the agate. On Thursday, a day of great religious and political operations, the vestment should be scarle t and on the forehead should be worn a brass tablet, with the char acter of the spirit of J upiter and the three words: G IA - RAR , B ETHOR , S AMGABIEL ; the perfumes are incense, ambergris, balm, grain of paradise, macis and saffron; the ring must be enriched with an emerald or sap- phire; the wreaths and crowns should be oak, poplar, g and pomegranate leaves.

On Saturday, a day of funereal operations, the vestment must be black or brown, with characters embroidered in orange or black silk; ro und the neck must be worn a lamina of lead, with the character of Saturn and the words: A LMALEC , A PHIEL , Z ARAHIEL ; the perfumes should be di agridrium, scammony, alum, sulphur and assafoetida; the ring should be adorned with an onyx; the garland s should be of ash, cypress and hellebore; on the onyx of the ring , during the hours of Saturn, the double head of Janus should be en graved with the consecrated awl. Such are the antique magnificences of the Secret Cultus of the Magi. With sim- ilar appointments the great magicians of the Middle Ag es proceeded to the daily consecration of talismans corresponding to the Seven Genii. We have defined a Pantacle as a synthetic character resuming the entire magical doctrine in one of its special conceptions. It is therefore the full expre ssion of a completed thought and will: it is the signatur e of a spirit. The ceremonial consecration of this sign attaches to it still more strongly the intention of the opera tor and establishes a veritable magnetic chain between himself and the Pa ntacle. Pantacles may be drawn upon virgin parchment, paper or metals. What is t ermed a talisman is a sheet of metal, bearing ei ther Pantacles or charact ers and having received a spe- cial consecration for a defined intention. In a learned work on magical antiquities, Gaffarel has demonstrated sci entifically the real power of talismans, and the con- fidence in their virtue is ot herwise so strong in Nature that we carry keepsakes of those we love, persuaded that they will preserve us fr om danger and increase our happiness. Talismans are made of the seve n kabalistic metals, and, when the days and hours are favourable, the require d and determined signs are engraved thereon. The figures of the seven planets, with their magical squares according to Paracelsus, are found in the Little Alber t: they are one of the very few serious items in this collection of vulgar Magic. It should be observed that Paracelsus replaces the figure of Jupite r by that of a priest, a su bstitution not wanting in a well-defined mysterious inte ntion. But the allegorical and mythological figures of the Seven Spirits have become too classi cal and too familiar for their successful use on talismans: we must recur to more recondite and pregnant signs. The Penta- gram should be engraved invariably upon on e side of the talisman, with a circle for the Sun, a crescent for the Moon, for Ma rs a sword, a G for Venus, for Jupiter a crown and a scythe for Saturn. The reverse must bear the Sign of Solomon, that is, the six-pointed star composed of two s uperposed triangles; in the centre there is placed a human figure for the talisman s of the Sun, a chalice for those of the Moon, a dog's head for those of Mercury, an eagle's for those of Jupiter, a lion's head for those of Mars, a d ove's for those of Venus, and a bull's or goat's for those"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"46 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic of Saturn. The names of the seven angels must be added in Hebrew, in Arabic or in magical characters like those of the alphabet of Trithemius. The two triangles of Solomon may be replaced by the double cross of the Wheels of Ezekiel, which is found on a great number of ancient Pantacl es and is, as we have observed in our “Doctrine” the key to the trigrams of Fohi. Precious stones may be also employed for amulets and talismans; but all objects of this nature, whet her metals or gems, must be kept carefully in silken bags of a colour analogous to that of the spirit of the planet , perfumed with the perfumes of the corresponding day, a nd preserved from all impure glances and contacts. Thus, Pantacles and talismans of the Sun must not be seen or touched by deformed or misshapen persons, or by immoral women; those of the Moon are profaned by the looks and hands of de bauched men and mens truating females; those of Mercury lose their virtue if seen or touched by salaried priests; those of Mars must be concealed from cowards; those of Venus from depraved men and men under a vow of celibacy; those of Jupiter from the impious; those of Saturn from virgins and children, not that their looks or touches can ever be impure, but because the talisman would bring them misfortune and thus lose all its virtue. Crosses of honour and other kindred de corations are veritable talismans which increase personal value and merit; they are consecrated by solemn investiture, and public opinion can impart to them a prodigious power. Sufficient attention has not been paid to the reciprocal infl uence of signs on ideas and of ideas on signs; it is not less true that the revolutionary work of modern times, for example, has been resumed symbolically in its enti rety by the Napoleonic substitution of the Star of Honour for the Cr oss of St. Louis. It is the Pentagram in place of the Labarum; it is the reconstitution of the sy mbol of light; it is the Masonic resurrec- tion of Adonhiram. They say that Napoleon believed in his st ar, and could he have been persuaded to explain wh at he meant thereby, it wo uld have proved to be his genius; he was right therefore in adoptin g the Pentagram as his sign, because it is the symbol of human sovereignty acquire d by intelligent initiative. The mighty soldier of the Revolution knew little, but he divined almost everything; so was he the greatest instinctive and practical magician of mode rn times; the world is still full of his miracles, and the country peop le will never believe that he is dead. Blessed and indulgenced objects, touche d by holy images or venerable persons; chaplets from Palestine; th e Agnus Dei, composed of the wax of the Paschal can- dle and the annual remnants of holy chri sm; scapulas and medals, are all true tal- ismans. One such medal has become popular in our own day, and even those who are devoid of religion suspen d it from the necks of their children. Moreover, its figures are so perfectly kabalistic that it is truly a marvellous double Pantacle. On the one side is the great initiatrix, the heavenly mother of the Zohar, the Isis of Egypt, the Venus-Urania of the Platonists , the Mary of Christianity, throned upon the world and setting one foot upon the head of the magical serpent. She extends"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE SEPTENARY OF TALISMANS 47 her two hands in such a mann er as to form a triangle, of which her head is the apex; her hands are open and radiant, thus making a double triangle, with all its rays directed towards the earth, eviden tly representing the emancipation of intel- ligence by labour. On the other side is the double T AU of the hierophants, the Lin- gam with the double Cteis or triple Phallus, supported , with interlacement and repeated insertion, by th e kabalistic and masonic M, representing the square between the two Pillars J AKIN and B OAZ . Below are placed, upon the same level, two loving and suffering hearts, encirc led by twelve Pentagrams. Everyone will tell you that the wearers of this medal do not attach such significance to it, but on this account it is only more absolute ly magical, having a dual sense and conse- quently a double virtue. Th e ecstatic on the authorit y of whose revelations this talisman was engraved, had already beheld it existing perfectly in the Astral Light, which demonstrates once more the intimate connexion of ideas and signs, giving a new sanction to the symbolism of Universal Magic. The greater the importance and solemnity brought to bear on the execution and consecration of talismans and Pantacles, the more virt ue they acquire, as will be under stood upon the evidence of the principles which we have established. Such consecration should take place on the days that we have indicated, with the apparatus which we have given in detail . Talismans are consecrated by the four exorcised elements, after conjuring the spirits of darkness by the C ONJURATION O F T HE F OUR . Then, taking up the Pa ntacle and sprinkling it with some drops of magical water, say: In the name of Eloim and by the spirit of the living waters, be thou unto me a sign of light and a sac- rament of will.

In the operations of Transcendental and Divine Magic, the lamp, wa nd and chalice are used; in the works of Black Magic, the wand is replaced by the sword and the lamp by the candle of Cardan. We shall explain this difference in the chapter de voted to Black Magic. Let us come now to the description and consecration of th e instruments. The magical wand, which must not be confounded with the simple divining rod, wi th the fork of necroman- cers, or the trident of Paracelsus, the tr ue and absolute magical wand must be one perfectly straight branch of almond or hazel , cut at a single blow with the magical pruning-knife or golden sickle , before the rising of the sun, at that moment when the tree is ready to blossom. It must be pierced through its whole length without splitting or breaking it, and a long need le of magnetized ir on must occupy its entire length. To one of the extremities must be fitted a polyhedral prism, cut in a triangular shape, and to the other a simila r figure of black resin. Two rings, one of copper and one of zinc, must be placed at the centre of th e wand; which after- wards must be gilt at the resin and silver ed at the prism end as far as the ringed centre; it must then be covered with silk , the extremities not included. On the cop- per ring these characte rs must be engraved: xeofxyvsenwv and on the zinc ring: xase\u0001wsax . The consecration of th e wand must last seven days, beginning at the new moon, and should be made by an initiate possessing the great arcana, and having him self a consecra ted wand. This is the tr ansmission of the magical secret, which has never ceased since the shrouded origin of the transcendent sci- ence. The wand and the other instruments, but the wand above all, must be con- cealed with care, and under no pretext should the Magus pe rmit them to be seen or touched by the profane: otherwise they will lose all their virtue. The mode of transmitting the wand is one of the arcana of science, the reve lation of which is never permitted. The length of the magical wand must not exceed that of the operator's arm; the magician must never use it unless he is alone, and even then should not touch it without necessity.

His Kabalist Gaffar el could furnish him with sword and talismans alone. This was possibly the secret motive for the cardinal's hatred of Urban Grandier, who knew something of his weaknesses. The secret and prolonged conversations of Laubardement with the unhappy priest so me hours before his final torture, and those words of a friend and confidant of the latter, as he went forth to death – “You are an able man, monsieur: do not destroy yourself” – afford us considerable food for thought.

On the middle knot of the guard, which should be covered with a golden plate, the Sign of the Macr ocosm must be inscribed on one side and that of the Microcosm on the other. The Hebrew mo nogram of Michael, as found in Agrippa, must be engraved on the pommel; on one si de of the blade must be these charac- ters: xjaj\u0001va\u0001xnxv\u0001pvsv'h , and on the other the monogram of the Labarum of Constantine, followed by the words: Vince in hoc, Deo duce, comite jerro . For the authenticity and exactitude of these figures, see the best ancient editions of the Enchiridion . The consecration of the sword mu st take place on a Sunday, during the hours of the Sun, under the invocation of Michael. The blade of the sword must be placed in a fire of laurel an d cypress; it must be dried and polished with ashes of the sacred fire, moistened with th e blood of a mole or serpent, the follow- ing words being said: Be thou unto me as the sword of Michael; by vi rtue of Eloim Sabaoth, may spirits of darkness and reptiles of earth flee away from thee! It is then fumigated with the perfu mes of the Sun and wr apped up in silk, together with branches of vervain, which should be burned on the seventh day. The magical lamp must be composed of the four metals – gold, silver, brass and iron; the pedestal should be of iron, the mirror of br ass, the reservoir of silver, the triangle at the apex of gold. It sh ould be provided with two branches com- posed of a triple tube of three intertwist ed metals, in such a manner that each arm has a triple conduit for the oil; there must be nine wicks in al l, three at the top and three in each branch. The Seal of Hermes must be engrave d on the pedestal, over which must be the tw o-headed androgyne of K hunrath. A serpent devouring its own tail must encircle the lower part. The Sign of Solomon must be inscribed on the reservoir. Two globes must be fitted to this lamp, one adorned with a trans- parency, representing the seven genii, wh ile the other, of larger size and dupli- cated, should contain vario usly tinted waters in fo ur compartments.

They may end in madness for thos e who are not established firmly on the basis of supreme, absolute and infallible reason. Terrible and incurable diseases can be occasioned by excessive nervous ex citement. Swoons and death itself, as a consequence of cerebral congestion, may result from imagination when it is impressed and terrified unduly. We cannot su fficiently dissuade nervous persons, and those who are naturally disposed to exaltation, women, young people and all who are not habituated in perfect self-co ntrol and command of fear. In the same way, there can be nothing more dangerou s than to make Magic a pastime, or, as some do, part of an evening's entertai nment. Even magnetic experiments, per- formed under such conditions, can only exhaust the subjects, mislead opinions and defeat science. The myst eries of life and death cann ot be made sport of with impunity, and things which are to be ta ken seriously must be treated not only seriously but also with the greatest reserve. Never yield to the desire of convincing others by phenomena. The most astounding would prove nothing to those who are not convinced already. They can be attribut ed always to ordinary artifices and the Magus included among the more or less skilful followers of Robert Houdin or Hamilton. To require prodigies as a warr ant for believing in science is to show one's self unworthy or incapable of science. S ANCTA S ANCTIS . Contemplate the twelfth figure of the Taro t-Keys, remember the grand sy mbol of Prometheus, and be silent. All those Magi who divulged their works died violently, and many were driven to suicide, like Cardan, Schroep ffer, Cagliostro, and others. The Magus should live in retirement and be approached with difficulty. Here is the import of the ninth Key of the Tarot, where the initiate appears as a hermit enveloped com- pletely in his cloak. This no twithstanding, such retirement must not be one of iso- lation; attachments and frie ndships are necessary; but th ey must be chosen with care and preserved at all price. The M agus must have also another avocation than that of magician. M agic is not a trade. In order to devote ourselves to Ceremoni al Magic, we must be free from anx- ious preoccupations; we must be in position to procur e all instruments of the sci- ence and be able to make them when needed; we must possess, moreover, an inaccessible laboratory, in which there will be no danger of being ever surprised or disturbed. Then, and this is an indisp ensable condition, we must know how to equilibrate forces and restrain the zeal of our own initiative. This is the meaning of the eighth Key of Hermes , wherein a woman is seated between two P illars, with an upright sword in one hand and a bala nce in the other. To equilibrate forces they must be maintained simultaneously and caused to act alternately: the use of the balance represents this double action . The same arcanum is typified by the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"WARNING TO THE IMPRUDENT 53 dual cross in the Pantacles of Pythagoras and Ezekiel: see the plate which appears at chapter 18 in the “Doctrine”, where the crosses equilibrate each other and the planetary signs are in permane nt opposition. Thus Venus is the equilibrium of the works of Mars; Mercury moderates and fu lfils the operations of the Sun and Moon. Saturn balances Jupiter. It was by means of this an tagonism between the ancient gods that Prometheus, that is to say, the genius of science, contrived to enter Olympus and carry off fire from heaven. Is it necessary to speak more clearly? The milder and calmer you are, the more effectiv e will be your anger; the more energetic you are, the more valuable will be your forbearance; the more skil- ful you are, the better will you profit by your intellig ence and even by your vir- tues; the more indifferent you are, the mo re easily will you make yourself loved. This is a matter of experience in the mora l order, and is realized literally in the sphere of action. Human passions produce blindly the opposite s of their unbridled desire, when they act without direction. Excessive love arouses antipathy; blind hate counteracts and scourges itself; vanity leads to ab asement and the most cruel humiliations. Thus, the Great Master reveal ed a mystery of positive magical sci- ence when He said: “Forgive your enemie s, do good to those that hate you; so shall ye heap coals of fire upon their heads.” Perhap s this kind of pardon may seem hypocrisy and bear a strong liken ess to refined vengeance. But we must remember that the Magus is sovereign, and a sovereign never avenges, because he has the right to punish; in the exercise of this right he pe rforms his duty and is implacable as justice. Let it be observed, for the rest, so that no one may misinter- pret my meaning, that it is a question of chastising evil by good and opposing mildness to violence. If the exercise of virtue be a flagellation for vice, no one has the right to demand that the latter should be spared, or that we should take pity on its shame and its sufferings. The man who dedicates himse lf to works of science must take moderate daily exercise, abstain from prol onged vigils, and follow a wholesome and regular rule of life. He must avoid the effluvia of putref action, the neighborhood of stagnant water and indigestible or impure food. Ab ove all, he must seek daily relaxation from magical preoccupations amongst mat erial cares, or in ordinary work, whether artistic, industrial or commercial. The way to see well is not to be always looking; and he who spends his whole life upon one object will end without attain- ing it. Another precaution must be observed equally, and that is never to experi- ment when ill. The ceremonies being, as we have said, artificial methods for creating a habit of will, become unne cessary when the habit is confi rmed. It is in this sense, and addressing himself solely to perfect adepts, that Para celsus proscribes ceremonial work in his Occult Philos ophy. But procedure must be simplified progressively before it is dispensed with altogether, in proportion to the experience we obtain in acquired powers, and established habit in the exercise of extranatural will."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"54 CHAPTER IX THE CEREMONIAL OF INITIATES T HE science is preserved by silence and perpetuated by initiation. The law of silence is not therefore abso lute and inviolable, except re latively to the uninitiated multitude. Such knowledge can be only transmitted by speech. The sages there- fore must speak occasionally. Yes, they must speak, not, however, to disclose, but lead others to discover. Noli ire, fac venire , was the device of Rabelais, who, being master of all the sciences of his time, could not be unacquainted with Magic. We have, consequently, to reveal here the my steries of initiation. The destiny of man, as we have said, is to make or create hi mself; he is and he wi ll be the son of his works, both for time and eter nity. All men are called into the lists, but the number of the elect – that is, of those who succ eed – is invariably small. In other words, the men who are desirous to attain ar e numbered by multitudes, but the chosen are few. Now, the government of the world belongs by right to the flower of man- kind, and when any combination or usur pation prevents th eir possessing it, a political or social catacl ysm ensues. Men who are ma sters of themselves become easily masters of others; but it is possible for them to hinder one another if they disregard the laws of discipl ine and of the universal hierarc hy. To be subjects of a discipline in common, there must be a co mmunity of ideas and desires, and such a communion cannot be attained except by a common reli gion established on the very foundations of intelligence and reason. This religion has existed always in the world, and is that only whic h can be called one, infallib le, indefectible and verita- bly catholic – that is, universal. This re ligion, of which all others have been suc- cessively the veils a nd shadows, is that which demons trates being by being, truth by reason, reason by evidence and common sense. It is that which proves by real- ities the reasonable basis of hypotheses, and forbids reasoning upon hypotheses independently of realities. It is that which is grounded on the doctrine of universal analogies but never confounds the things of science with those of faith. It can never be of faith that two and one make more or less than three; that in physics the contained can exceed the co ntainer; that a solid body , as such, can act like a fluidic or gaseous body; that, for exam ple, a human body can pass through a closed door without dissolut ion or opening. To say that one believes such a thing is to talk like a child or a fool; yet it is no less insensate to de fine the unknown and to argue from hypothesis to hypothesis , till we come to deny evidence a priori for the affirmation of precipitate supposit ions. The wise man affirms what he knows and believes in what he does not know only in proportion to the reasonable and known necessities of hypothesis. But this reasonable religion is unadapt ed for the multitude ; fables, mysteries, definite hopes and terrors having a physical basis, are needful fo r these. It is for this reason that the priesthood has been established in the worl d. Now, the priest-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE CEREMONIAL OF INITIATES 55 hood is recruited by initiation. Religious forms perish when init iation ceases in the sanctuary, whether by the betrayal of th e Mysteries or by their neglect and obliv- ion. The Gnostic disclosures, for exampl e, alienated the Christian Church from the high truths of the Kabalah, which contains all secrets of transcendental theol- ogy. Hence the blind, having become leaders of the blind, grea t obscurities, great lapses and deplorable scandals have foll owed. Subsequently, the sacred books, of which the keys are all kabalistic from Genesis to the Apocal ypse, have become so little intelligible to Chri stians, that prudent pastors have judged it necessary to forbid them being read by the uninstru cted among believers. Taken literally and understood materially, such books could be only an inconceivable tissue of absur- dities and scandals, as the school of Volt aire has demonstrated but too well. It is the same with all the ancient dogmas, th e brilliant theogonies and poetic legends. To say that ancient Greece believed in th e love-adventures of Jupiter, or that Egypt worshipped the cynocephalus and sparrow-hawk, is to exhibit as much ignorance and bad faith as would be show n by maintaining that Christians adore a triple God, composed of an old man, an executed criminal and a dove. The igno- rance of symbols is invariably calumnious. For this reason we should be on our guard first and foremost agai nst the derision of that which we do not know, when its enunciation seems to involve some absurd ity or even singularity, as a course no less wanting in good sense than to admi t the same without discussion and exami- nation. Prior to anything which may please or displease ourselves, there is a truth – that is to say, a reason – and by this reason must our actions be regulated rather than by our desires, if we would create that intelligence within us which is the rai- son d'être of immortality, and that just ice which is the law thereof. A man who is truly man can will only that which he shou ld reasonably and justly do; so also he silences lusts and fea rs, that he may hearken solely to reason. Now, such a man is a natural king and a voluntary priest for erring multitudes. Hence it was that the end of the old initiations was termed indifferently the Sacerdotal Art and the Royal Art. The antique magi cal associations were semin aries for priests and kings, and admission could be obtained only by truly sacerdotal and royal works – that is, by transcending all weakness of Nature . We will not repeat here what is found everywhere concerning Egyptian Initiati ons, perpetuated, but with diminished power, in the Secret Soci eties of the Middle Ages. Ch ristian radicalism, founded upon a false understanding of the words: “Ye have one father, one master, and ye are all brethren,” dealt a terrible blow at the sacred hierarc hy. Since that time, sacerdotal dignities have become a matter of intrigue or of chance; energetic mediocrity has managed to supplant mode st superiority, misunderstood because of its modesty.

What, in fact, did the candidate in the old initiations? He abandoned his life and liberty entirely to the masters of the temples of Thebes or Memphis; he advanced resolutely through unnumbered terrors, which might have led him to imagine that there was a premeditated ou trage intended against him; he ascended funeral pyres, swam torrents of blac k and raging water, hung by unknown see- saws over unfathomed precipi ces. . . . Was not this blind obedience in the full force of the term? Is it not the most absolute exercise of liberty to abjure liberty for a time so that we may attain emancipa tion? Now, this is precisely what must be done, and what has been done invar iably, by those who aspire to the S ANCTUM R EGNUM of magical omnipotence. The disc iples of Pythagoras condemned them- selves to inexorable silence for many yea rs; even the sectaries of Epicurus compre- hended the sovereignty of pleasure only by the acquisition of sobriety and calculated temperance. Life is a warfare in which we mu st give proofs if we would advance; power does not surrender of itself; it mu st be seized. Initiation by contest and ordeal is ther efore indispensable for the attainment of the practical science of Magi c. We have indicated aft er what manner the four ele- mentary forms may be vanquish ed and will not repeat it here; we refer those of our readers who would inquire into the ceremonies of ancient initiations to the works of Baron Tschoudy, author of the Blazing Star, Adonhiramite Masonry and some other most valua ble masonic treatises. We must insist, however, upon one reflect ion, namely, that the intellectual and social chaos in the midst of which we are perishing has been caused by the neglect of initiation, its ordeals and its mysterie s. Men, whose zeal was greater than their science, carried away by the popular maxims of the Gospel, came to believe in the primitive and absolute equality of men. A famous halluciné, the eloquent and unfortunate Rousseau, propagated with all the magic of his style the paradox that society alone depraves men – much as if he had said that competition and emula- tion in labour render workmen idle. The ess ential law of Nature , that of initiation by effort and of voluntary and toilsome progress, has been misconstrued fatally. Masonry has had its deserters, as Catholic ism its apostates. What has been the consequence? The substitution of a cast-i ron level for the intellectual and symbol- ical level. To preach equality to what is beneath, without inst ructing it how to rise upward, is not this condem ning us to descend ours elves? And hence we have stooped to the reign of the Carmagnola, the Sanscullotes and Marat. To restore tottering and distracted society, the hiera rchy and initiation must be again estab- lished.

We have given the symbol and interpretation of the Pantacl es of Pythagoras and Ezekiel, so that we have no need to recur to these; we shall pr ove in a later chapter that all the instru- ments of Hebrew worship were Pantacles, and the first and fina l word of the Bible was graven by Moses in gold and in brass on the tabernacle a nd on all its accesso- ries. But each Magus can an d should have his individu al Pantacle, for, understood accurately, a Pantacle is the perfect su mmary of a mind. Hence we find in the Magical Calendars of Tycho Brahe and Duchentau, the Pantacles of Adam, Job, Jeremiah, Isaiah, and of all the other grea t prophets who have been, each in his turn, the kings of the Kabalah an d the grand rabbi ns of science. The Pantacle, being a complete and p erfect synthesis expressed by a single sign, serves to focus all intellectual force into a glance, a reco llection, a touch. It is, so to speak, a starting-point for the efficient projection of will. Nigro-mancers and goëtic magicians traced their infernal Pantacles on the skin of the victims they immolated. The sacrificial ceremoni es, the manner of skin ning the kid, then of salting, drying and bleaching the sk in, are given in a number of Clavicles and Grimoires. Some Hebrew Kabali sts fell into similar follie s, forgetting the anathe- mas pronounced in the Bible against those who sacrifice on high places or in the caverns of the earth. All spilling of blood operated ceremonially is abominable and impious, and sinc e the death of Adonhiram the So ciety of true Adepts has a horror of blood – Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine .

The five books of Moses, the Prophecy of Ezekiel and the Apocalypse of St. John are the three kabalistic keys of th e whole Biblical edifi ce. The sphinxes of Ezekiel are identical with those of the sanctuary and the ark, being a fourfold reproduction of the Egyptian Tetrad; th e wheels revolving in one another are the harmonious spheres of Pythagoras; the ne w temple, the plan of which is given according to exact kabalistic measures, is the type of the labours of primitive Masonry. St. John in his Apocalypse re produces the same images and the same numbers, and reconstructs the Edenic wo rld ideally in the New Jerusalem; but at the source of the four rivers the Solar La mb replaces the mysterious tree. Initia- tion by toil and blood has been acco mplished, and there is no more temple because the light of truth is diffused universally and the world has become the Temple of Justice. This splendid final vi sion of the Holy Scriptures, this divine Utopia which the Church has referred with good reason for its realization to a bet- ter life, has been the pitfal l of all ancient arch-heretic s and of many modern ideal- ists. The simultaneous emancipation and ab solute equality of all men involve the arrest of progress and consequently of li fe; in a world where all are equal there could no longer be infants or the aged; birth and death could not be therefore admitted. This is su fficient to demonstrate that th e New Jerusalem is no more of this world than the Primeval Paradise, wherein there was no knowledge of good or evil, of liberty, of generation or of death. The cycle of our religious symbolism begins and ends therefore in eternity. Dupuis and Volney lavished their great er udition to discover this relative iden- tity of all symb ols and arrived at the negation of every religion. We attain by the same path to an affirmation diametricall y opposed; we recogn ize with admiration that there have never been any false reli gions in the civilize d world; that the Divine Light, the splendou r of the Supreme Reason of the Logos, of that Word which enlightens every man coming into the world, has been no more wanting to the children of Zoroaster than to the fait hful sheep of St. Pe ter; that the perma- nent, the one, the universal revelation, is written in visible Nature, explained in reason, and completed by the wise analogies of faith; that there is, finally, but one true religion, having one do ctrine and one legitimate be lief, even as there is but one God, one reason and one universe; that revelation is obscure for no one, since the whole world understands mo re or less both truth and justice, and since all that is possible can only exist analogically to all that is.

The mighty angel with the face of a sun, a rainbow for nimbus an d a cloud for vestme nt, having pillars of fire for his legs, and setting one foot upo n the earth and another on the sea, is truly a kabalis- tic P ANTHEA .

The beast with seven heads, in the symbolism of St. John, is the material and antago- nistic negation of the lumino us septenary; the Babylonian harlot corresponds after the same manner to the Woman clothed w ith the Sun; the four horsemen are anal- ogous to the four alle gorical living creatures; the seven angels with their seven trumpets, seven cups and seven swords characterize the absolute of the struggle of good against evil by speech, by religious a ssociation and by force. Thus are the seven seals of the occult book opened successively, and unive rsal initiation is accomplished. The commentators who have sought anything el se in this book of the transcendent Kabalah have lost thei r time and their trouble only to render themselves ridiculous.

To form the magnetic chain is to originate a current of ideas which pr oduces faith and draws a large number of wills in a given circle of active manifest ation. a well-formed ch ain is like a whirl- pool which sucks down and absorbs all. The chain may be established in three ways – by signs, by speech and by contact. The first is by inducing opinion to adopt some sign as the representation of a force. Thus, all Christians communi- cate by the Sign of the Cross, Masons by that of the square beneath the sun, the Magi by that of the Micr ocosm, made by extending the five fingers, etc. Once accepted and propagated, sign s acquire force of themselv es. In the early centuries of our era, the sight and making of the Sign of the Cross wa s enough to bring proselytes to Christianity. Wh at is called the miraculous medal continues in our own days to effect a great number of conv ersions by the same magnetic law. The vision and illumination of the young Isra elite, Alphonse de Ratisbonne, is the most remarkable fact of this kind. Imagina tion is creative not only within us but without us by means of our fluidic pr ojections, and undoubt edly the phenomena of the Labarum of Constantine and the Cross of Migné should be attributed to no other cause. The magic chain of speech wa s typified among the anci ents by chains of gold, which issued from the mout h of Hermes. Nothing equals the electricity of elo- quence. Speech creates the highest intel ligence in the most grossly constituted masses. Even those who are too remote fo r actual hearing understand by sympa- thy and are carried away with the crowd. Peter the Hermit convulsed Europe by his cry of “God wills it!” A single word of the Empero r electrified his army and made France invincible. Proudhon destr oyed socialism by his celebrated paradox: “Property is robbery.” A current saying is sufficient on occa sion to demolish a reigning power. Voltaire knew this well – he who shook the world by sarcasms. So, also, he who feared neither pope nor ki ng, neither parliament nor Bastille, was afraid of a pun. We are on the verge of fulfilling the in tentions of that man whose sayings we repeat. The third method of establishing the m agic chain is by contact. Between per- sons who meet frequently, the head of th e current soon manifests, and the stron- gest will is not slow to ab sorb the others. The direct and positive grasp of hand by hand completes the harmony of dispositions , and it is for this reason a mark of sympathy and intimacy. Children, who are guided instinctively by Nature, form the magic chain by playing at base or rounds: then gaiety spreads, then laughter"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"62 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic rings. Circular tables are more favourable to convivial meetings than those of any other shape. The great circular dance of the Sabbath, which concluded the myste- rious assemblies of adepts in the Middle Ag es, was a magic chain: it joined all in the same intentions and the same acts. It was formed by standing back to back and linking hands, the face outside the circ le, in imitation of those antique sacred dances, representations of which are still found on the sculptu res of old temples. The electric furs of the lynx, panther and even domestic cat, we re stitched to gar- ments, in imitation of the ancient bacchan alia. Hence comes the tradition that the Sabbath miscreants each wore a cat hung fr om the girdle, and that they danced in this guise. The phenomena of tilting a nd talking tables have been fortuitous exhibitions of fluidic communication by means of the circular chain. Mystification combined with it after wards, and even educated and intelligent persons were so infatuated with the novelty that they hoaxed thems elves, and became the dupes of their own absurdity. The oracles of the tables were answers mo re or less voluntarily sug- gested extracted by chance: they resembled the conve rsations which we hold or hear in dreams. Other and stranger phenomena may have been exteriorized prod- ucts of imaginations at work in common. We, however, by no means deny the pos- sible intervention of elementary spirit s in these occurrences, as in those of divination by cards or by dreams; but we do not believe that it has been in any sense proven, and we are therefore in no way obliged to admit it. One of the most extraordinary powers of human imagination is the fulfilment of the desires of the will, or even of it s apprehensions and fears. We believe easily anything that we fear or desire, says a proverb; and it is true, because desire and fear impart to imagination a realizing powe r, the effects of which are incalculable. How is one attacked, for example, by a disease about which one feels nervous? We have cited already the opinions of Paracel sus on this point, and have established in our doctrinal part certai n occult laws confirmed by experience; but in magnetic currents, and by mediation of the chain, the realizations are all the more strange because almost invariably unexpected, at least when the chain has not been formed by an intelligent, sympathetic and powerful leader. In fact, they are the result of purely blind and fortuitous co mbinations. The vulgar fear of supersti- tious guests when they find th emselves thirteen at table, and their conviction that some misfortune threatens the younges t and weakest among them, like most superstitions, a remnant of magical scie nce. The duodenary, being a complete and cyclic number in the univ ersal analogies of Nature , invariably attracts and absorbs the thirteenth, which is regarded as a sinister and superfluous number. If the grindstone of a mill be represented by the number twel ve, then thirteen is that of the grain which is to be ground. On kindred considera tions, the ancients estab- lished the distinctions between lucky and unlucky numbers, whence came the observance of days of good or evil augury. It is over such matters above all that"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE TRIPLE CHAIN 63 imagination is creative, so that both days and numbers seldo m fail to be propi- tious or otherwise to those who believe in their influence. Consequently, Chris- tianity was right in proscribing the divina tory sciences, for in thus diminishing the number of blind chances it gave furt her scope and empire to liberty. Printing is an admirable instrument fo r the formation of the magic chain by the extension of speech. No book is lost; as a fact, writings go invariably precisely where they should go, and the aspirati ons of thought attract speech. We have proved this a hundred times in the course of our magi cal initiation; the rarest books have offered themselves without seeki ng as soon as they became indispens- able. Thus have we recovered intact that universal science whic h so many learned persons have regarded as engulfed by a number of successive cataclysms; thus have we entered the great magical chai n which began with Hermes or Enoch and will end only with the worl d. Thus have we been able to evoke and come face to face with the spirits of Apollonius, Plot inus, Synesius, Paracelsus, Cardanus, Cor- nelius Agrippa and others less or more known, but too religiously celebrated to make it possible for them to be named lightly. We continue their great work, which others will take up af ter us. But unto whom shall it be given to complete it?"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"64 CHAPTER XII THE GREAT WORK T O be ever rich, to be always young and to die never: su ch, from all time, has been the dream of alchemists. To change lead, mercury, and the other metals into gold, to possess the Universal Medi cine and the Elixir of Li fe – such is the problem which must be solved to accomplish this d esire and to realize this dream. Like all magical mysteries, the secrets of the Grea t Work have a triple meaning: they are religious, philosophical and natural. Philo sophical gold in religion is the Absolute and Supreme Reason; in philosophy, it is trut h; in visible nature , it is the sun: in the subterranean a nd mineral world, it is the pur est and most perf ect gold. Hence the search after the Great Work is called the Search for the Absolute, and this work itself is termed the op eration of the sun. All mast ers of science recognize that it is impossible to achieve material re sults until we have found the plenary analo- gies of the Universal Medicine and the Philosophical Stone in the two superior degrees. Then, it is affirmed, is the labo ur simple, light and inexpensive: other- wise, it consumes to no purpose the li fe and fortune of the bellows-blower. The Universal Medicine is, for the soul, supreme reason and absolute justice; for the mind, it is mathematical and practical truth; for the body, it is the quintes- sence, which is a combinatio n of gold and light. In th e superior world, the first matter of the Great Work is enthusiasm and activity; in the inte rmediate world, it is intelligence and industry; in the inferior world, it is labour; in science it is Sul- phur, Mercury and Salt, which, volatilized and fixed alternately, compose the A ZOTH of the sages. Sulphur corresponds to the elementary form of fire, Mercury to air and water, Salt to earth. All ma sters in alchemy who have written concern- ing the Great Work have employed symbolical a nd figurative expressions, and have been right in so doing, not only to deter the profane from operations which would be dangerous for them, but to make themselves intelligible to adepts by revealing the entire world of analogies which is ruled by th e one and sovereign dogma of Hermes. For such, gold and si lver are the Sun and Moon, or the King and Queen; Sulphur is the Flying Eagle; Mercury is the winged and bearded Her- maphrodite, throned upon a cube and crowne d with flames; matter or Salt is the Winged Dragon; metals in the molten stat e are Lions of various colours; finally, the whole work is symboli zed by the Pelican and Phoen ix. Hermetic art is, there- fore, at one and the same time, a relig ion, a philosophy and a natural science. Considered as religion, it is that of th e ancient Magi and the initiates of all the ages; as a philosophy, its principles may be found in th e school of Alexandria and in the theories of Pythagoras; as science, its principles must be sought from Paracelsus, Nicholas Flamel and Raymund Lully. The science is true only for those who accept and understand the philoso phy and religion, while its processes"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE GREAT WORK 65 are successful only for the adept who has attained sovereign volition, and has thus become monarch of the elementary world, for the Great Agent of the solar work is that force described in the Hermetic Symbol of the “Emerald Ta ble”: it is univer- sal magical power; it is the igneous spir itual motor; it is the OD of the Hebrews and the Astral Light, accord ing to the expression whic h we have adopted in this work. There is the secret, living and philo sophical fire, of which all Hermetic phi- losophers speak only under the most myst erious reservations; there is the univer- sal sperm, the secret of which they gu arded, representing it only under the emblem of the caduceus of Hermes. Here then is the great Hermetic Arcanum, and we reveal it for the fi rst time clearly and devoid of mystical figures: that which the adepts term dead substances ar e bodies as found in Nature; living sub- stances are those which have been assimi lated and magnetized by the science and will of the operator. There-fore the Grea t Work is something more than • chemical operation: it is an actual creation of the human Word initiated into the power of the Word of God Himself. This Hebrew text, which we transcribe in proof of the authenticity and reality of our discovery, is derived from the rabbinical Jew Abra ham, the master of Nicholas Flamel, and it is found in his occult commenta ry on the Sepher Yetzirah the sacred book of the Kabalah. This co mmentary is extremely rare, but the sym- pathetic potencies of our ch ain led us to the discovery of a copy which has been preserved since the year 1643 in the Protestant church at Rouen. On its first page there is written: Ex dono , then an illegible name, followed by Dei magni . The creation of gold in the Great Work takes place by transmutation and mul- tiplication. Raymund Lully states that in order to make gold we must have gold and mercury, while in order to make silver we must have silver and mercury. Then he adds: “By Mercury, I understand that mineral spirit which is so refined and purified that it gilds the s eed of gold and silvers the seed of silver.” Doubtless he is here speaking of O D , or Astral Light. Salt and Su lphur are serviceable in the work only for the preparation of Mercury: it is with Mercury above all that the Magnetic Agent must be assimilated and as if in corporated. Paracelsus, Raymund Lully and Nicholas Flamel seem alone to have und erstood this mystery perfectly. Basil Val- entine and Trevisan indicate it after an incomplete ma nner, which might be capa-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"66 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic ble of another interpretation. But the mo st curious things which we have found on this subject are indicated by the mystical figures and m agical legends in a book of Henry Khunrath, entitled Amphitheatrum Sapientae Aeternae . Khunrath repre- sents and resumes the most learned Gnostic schools, and connects in symbology with the mysticism of Syn esius. He affects Christiani ty in expressions and in signs, but it is easy to see that his Christ is the A BRAXAS , the Lumino us Pentagram radiating on the Astronomical Cross, the incarnation in humanity of the sovereign sun celebrated by the Emperor Julian; it is the luminous and living manifestation of that Ruach - Elohim wh ich, according to Moses, brooded and worked upon the bosom of the waters at the birth of the world; it is the man-sun, the monarch of light, the supreme magus, the master and conqueror of the serpent, and in the fourfold legend of the evange lists, Khunrath finds the al legorical key of the Great Work. One of the Pantacles of his magical book represents the Philosophical Stone erected in the middle of a fortress surro unded by a wall in which there are twenty impracticable gates. One alone conducts to the sanc tuary of the Great Work. Above the Stone there is a triangle pl aced upon a winged dragon, and on the Stone is graven the name of Christ, quali fied as the symbolical image of all Nature. “It is by Him alone,” he adds, “that thou canst obtain the Universal Med- icine for men, animals, vegetables and mi nerals.” The Winged Dragon, dominated by the triangle, represents therefore the Christ of Khunrath – that is, the Sover- eign Intelligence of Light a nd Life. It is the secret of the Pentagram; it is the high- est dogmatic and practical mystery of Tr aditional Magic. Thence unto the grand and ever-incommunicable maxi m there is only one step. The kabalistic figures of Abraham the Je w, which imparted to Flamel the first desire for knowledge, are no other than the twenty-two Keys of the Tarot, imi- tated and resumed elsewhere in the twelve Keys of Basil Valentine, There the sun and moon reappear under the figures of Emperor and Empress; Mercury is the Juggler; the Great Hierophant is the ad ept or abstractor of the quintessence; Death, Judgement, Love, the Dragon or Devil, the Hermit or Lame Elder and finally all the remaining symbols are to be found with their chief attributes, almost in the same order. It could have been scarcely otherwise, since the Tarot is the primeval book and the keystone of the oc cult sciences: it must be Hermetic, because it is kabalistic, magical and theo sophical. So also we find by combining its twelfth and twenty-second Keys, supe rposed one upon the other, the hiero- glyphic revelation of the solution of the Grand Work and its mysteries. The twelfth Key represents a man hanging by one foot from a gibbet composed of three trees or posts, fo rming the Hebrew letter m ; the man's arms and head consti- tute a triangle, and his enti re hiero-glyphical shape is that of a reversed triangle surmounted by a cross, an alchemical symbol known to all adepts and represent- ing the accomplishment of the Great Wo rk. The twenty-second Key, which bears the number twenty-one because the fool which precedes it carries no numeral,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE GREAT WORK 67 represents a youthful female divinity, veiled slightly and running in a flowering circle, supported at four corn ers by the four beasts of the Kabalah. In the Italian Tarot this divinity has a rod in either hand; in the Besançon Tarot, the two wands are in one hand while the ot her is placed upon her thig h, both equally remarkable symbols of magnetic action, either alternate in its pola rization or simultaneous by opposition and transmission. The Great Work of Hermes is therefore an essentiall y magical operation and the highest of all, for it supposes the absolute in science and volition. There is light in gold, gold in light and light in all things. The intelligent will, which assim- ilates the light, directs in this manner the operations of substantial form, and uses chemistry solely as a secondary instru ment. The influence of human will and intelligence upon the operations of Nature, de pendent in part on its labour, is oth- erwise a fact so real that all serious alch emists have succeeded in proportion to their knowledge and their faith, and have reproduced their thought in the phe- nomena of the fusion, salification and r ecomposition of metals. Agrippa, who was a man of immense erudition and fine geni us, but pure philo sopher and sceptic, could not transcend the limits of metallic analysis and synthesis. Etteilla, a con- fused, obscure, fantastic but persevering Kabalist, reproduced in alchemy the eccentricities of his misconstrued and mu tilated Tarot; metals in his crucibles assumed extraordinary forms, which excited the curiosit y of all Paris, with no greater profit to the operator than the fees which were paid by his visitors. An obscure bellows-blower of our own time, who died ma d, poor Louis Cambriel, really cured his neighbours, and, by the evidence of all his parish, brought back to life a smith who was his friend. For him the metallic work took the most incon- ceivable and apparently illogical forms. On e day he beheld the figure of God Him- self in his crucible, incand escent like the sun, transp arent as crystal, his body composed of triangular conglomerations , which Cambriel naïvely compared to quantities of tiny pears. One of our friends, who is a learned Kabalist but be longs to an initiation which we regard as erroneous, performed recentl y the chemical operations of the Great Work and succeeded in impair ing his sight through the ex cessive brilliance of the Athanor. He created a new metal which r esembles gold but is not gold, and hence has no value. Raymond Lully, Nicholas Flamel and most probably Henry Khun- rath made true gold, nor did they take away their se cret with them, for it is enshrined in their symbols, and they h ave indicated, moreover, the sources from which they drew for its discovery and for th e realization of its effects, It is this same secret which we ou rselves make public now."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"68 CHAPTER XIII NECROMANCY W E have declared bold ly our opinion, or rather our conviction, as to the possibil- ity of resurrection in certai n cases: it remains for us now to complete the revela- tion of this arcanum and to expose its practice. Death is a phantom of ignorance; it does not exist; everything in Nature is living, and it is because it is alive that everything is in motion and undergoes in cessant change of fo rm. Old age is the beginning of regeneration; it is the labour of renewing life; and the ancients repre- sented the mystery we term death by th e Fountain of Youth, which was entered in decrepitude and left in new childhood. The body is a garmen t of the soul. When this garment is worn out completely, or ser iously and irreparably rent, it is aban- doned and never rejoined. But when it is removed by some acci dent without being worn out or destroyed, it can, in certain cases, be re assumed, either by our own efforts or by the assistance of a stronger and more active will than ours. Death is neither the end of life nor th e beginning of immortality: it is the continuation and transformation of life. Now a transformati on being always a pr ogress, few of those who are apparently dead will consent to return to life, th at is, to take up the vest- ment which they have left behind. It is this which ma kes resurrection one of the hardest works of the highest initiation, and hence its success is never infallible, but must be regarded almost invariably as accidental and unexpected. To raise up a dead person we must rivet suddenly and energetically the mo st powerful chains of attraction which connect it with the body that it has just quitted. It is, there- fore, necessary to be acquainted previously with this chain, th en to seize thereon, finally to project an effort of will suffic iently powerful to link it up instanta- neously and irresistibly. All this, as we say, is extremely difficult, but is in no sense absolutely impossible. The prejudices of materialistic science exclude resurrection at present from the natural order of th ings, and hence there is a disposition to explain all phenomena of this class by lethargies, more or less complicated with signs of death and more or less long in duration. If Lazarus rose again before our doctors, they would record in their memor ials to official ac ademies a strange case of lethargy, accompanied by an apparent beginning of putrefaction and a strong corpse-like odour: the exceptional occurren ce would be labell ed with a suitable name, and the matter would be at an end. We have no wish to alarm anyone, and if, out of respect for men wi th diplomas who represent or thodox science, it is req- uisite to term our theories concerning resu rrection the art of curing exceptional and aggravated trances, nothing, I hope, wi ll hinder us from making such a con- cession. But if ever a resurr ection has taken place in the world, it is incontestable that resurrection is possibl e. Now, the bodies corporate protect religion, and reli- gion asserts positively the fact of resurr ections; therefore resurrections are possi- ble. From this escape is diff icult. To say that such thin gs are possible outside the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"NECROMANCY 69 laws of Nature, and by an influence co ntrary to universal harmony, is to affirm that the spirit of disorder, darkness and de ath can be sovereign arbiter of life. Let us not dispute with worshippers of the devil, but pass on. It is not religion alone whic h attests the facts of resurrection: we have collected a number of cases. An occu rrence which impressed the imagination of Greuze the painter has been reproduced by him in one of his most remarkable pictures. An unworthy son, present at his father's deathbed, seizes an d destroys a will unfavourable to himself; the father rallies, leaps up, cu rses his son and then drops back dead a second time. An analogous and more recent fact ha s been certified to ourselves by ocular witness es: a friend, betraying the confidence of one who had just died, tore up a trust-deed he had signed, whereupon the dead person rose up and lived to defend the rights of his chosen heirs, whic h this false friend sought to set aside; the guilty person went mad, and the risen man compassionately allowed him a pension. When the Saviour raised up the daughter of Ja irus, He was alone with three faithful and favoured discipl es: He dismissed the noisy mourners, say- ing: “The girl is not dead but sleeping.” Then, in the presence only of the father, mother and the three disciples, that is to say, in a perf ect circle of confidence and desire, He took the child's hand, drew her suddenly up and cried to her: “Young girl, I say to thee, arise!” The undecided soul, doubtless in the immediate vicinity of the body, and possibly regretting it s extreme youth and beauty, was surprised by the accents of that voi ce which was heard by her father and mother, trembling with hope and on their knees; it returned into the body; the maiden opened her eyes, rose up and the Master commanded immediately that food should be given her, so that the functions of life might begin a new cycle of absorption and regen- eration. The history of Eliseus raisin g up the daughter of the Shunamite, and of St. Paul raising Eutychus are facts of the same order; the resurrection of Dorcas by St. Peter, narrated so simply in the Ac ts of the Apostles, is also a history the truth of which it is diffic ult to dispute with reason. Apollonius of Tyana seems to have accomplished similar miracles, whil e we ourselves have been the witness of facts which are not wanting in analogy with these; but the spirit of the century in which we live imposes in this respect th e most careful reserv e upon us, the thau- maturge being liable to a very indiffer ent reception at the hands of a discerning public – all which does not hi nder the earth from revolving or Galileo from having been a great man. The resurrection of a dead person is the masterpiece of magnetism, because it needs for its accomplishment the exercise of a kind of sympathetic omnipotence. It is possible in the exhaustion of death by congestion, by suffocation, by exhaus- tion or by hysteria. Eutychus, who was r esuscitated by St. Paul after falling from a third storey, had doubtless suffered no serious internal in juries, but had suc- cumbed to asphyxia, occasioned by the rush of air during his fall, or alternatively to violent shock and terror. In a parallel case, he who feels conscious of the power"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"70 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic and faith necessary for such an achievement must, like the apostle, practise insuf- flation, mouth to mouth, co mbined with contact of th e extremities for restoration of warmth. Were it simply a matter of what the ignora nt call miracle, Elias and St. Paul, who made us e of the same procedure, would have spoken in the name of Jehovah or of Christ. It is enough sometimes to take the person by the hand and raise them quickly, summoning them in a loud voice. This pr ocedure, which suc- ceeds frequently in swoons, may even h ave effect upon the dead, when the mag- netizer who exercises it is endowed with powerfully sympathetic speech and possesses what may be called eloquence of tone. He must be also tenderly loved or greatly respected by the person on whom he would operate, and he must perform the work with a great burst of faith an d will, which we do not always find our- selves to possess in the firs t shock of a great sorrow. What is vulgarly called Necromancy ha s nothing in common with resurrection, and it is at least highly doubtful whether, in operations connected with this appli- cation of magical power, we really come in to correspondence with the souls of the dead whom we evoke. Ther e are two kinds of Necromancy, that of light and that of darkness – the evocation by Prayer, Pa ntacle and Perfumes, and the evocation by blood, imprecations and sacrilege. We have practised only the first, and advise no one to devote themselves to the second. It is certain that the images of the dead do appear to the magnetized persons who evoke them; it is cer tain also that they never reveal any mysteries of the life beyo nd. They are beheld as they still exist in the memories of those who kn ew them, and doubtless as their reflections have left them impressed on the Astral Light. When evoked spectres reply to questions addressed them, it is always by signs or by interior and imaginary impressions, never with a voice which re ally strikes the ears; a nd this is comprehensible enough, for how should a shadow speak? With what instrument could it cause the air to vibrate by impressing it in such a manner as to make distinct sounds? At the same time, electrical contacts are ex perienced from apparitions and sometimes appear to be produced by the hand of a phantom; but the phenomena is wholly subjective, is occasioned solely by the power of imagination and the local wealth of that occult force which we term the Astr al Light. The proof of this is that spir- its, or at least the spectres pretended to be such, may indeed touch us occasion- ally, but we cannot touch them, and th is is one of the most affrighting characteristics of these appa ritions, which are at times so real in appearance that we cannot unmoved feel the hand pass thro ugh that which seems a body and yet make contact with nothing. We read in ecclesiastical historians that Spiridion, Bishop of Tremithonte, afterwards invoked as a saint, called up th e spirit of his daught er, Irene, to ascer- tain from her the whereabouts of some concealed money which she had taken in charge for a traveller. Swedenborg comm unicated habitually with the so-called dead, whose forms appeared to him in the Astral Light. Several credible persons"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"NECROMANCY 71 of our acquaintance have assu red us that they have been revisited for years by the dead who were dear to th em. The celebrated atheist Sylvanus Maréchal appeared to his widow and one of her friends, to acquaint her concerning a sum of 1,500 francs which he had concealed in a secret drawer. This anecdote was related to us by an old friend of the family. Evocations should have always a motive and a justifiable e nd; otherwise, they are works of darkness and fo lly, most dangerous for he alth and reason. To evoke out of pure curiosity, or to find out whether we shall see anything, is to court fruit- less fatigue. The transcenden tal sciences admit of neithe r doubt nor puerility. The permissible motive of an e vocation may be either love or intelligence. Evocations of love require less apparatus and are in every respect easier. The procedure is as follows. We must co llect, in the first place, carefu lly the memorials of him-or her- whom we desire to behold, the articles he used, and on which his impression remains; we must also prepare an apartmen t in in which the person lived, or oth- erwise one of similar kind, and place his portrait veiled in white therein, sur- rounded with his favourite flowers, which must be renewed daily. A fixed date must then be chosen, being that of the pe rson's birth, or on e that was especially fortunate for his and our own affection, one of which we may believe that his soul, however blessed elsewhere, cannot lose the remembrance. This must be the day of evocation, and we must prepare for it dur ing the space of tw o weeks. Throughout the period we must refrain from extendin g to anyone the same proofs of affection which we have the right to expect from th e dead; we must observe strict chastity, live in retreat and take only one modest and light collation daily. Every evening at the same hour we must shut ourselves in the chamber consecrated to the memory of the lamented person, using only one sma ll light, such as th at of a funeral lamp or taper. This light should be placed behind us, the portrait should be uncovered, and we should remain before it for an hour in silence; finally, we should fumigate the apartment with a little good incense , and go out backwards. On the morning of the day fixed for the evoc ation, we should adorn ourse lves as if for a festival, not salute anyone first, make but a single repast of bread, wine and roots, or fruits. The cloth should be white, two covers should be laid, and one portion of the broken bread should be set aside; a little wine shou ld be placed also in the glass of the person whom we design to invoke. The meal must be eaten alone in the chamber of evocations a nd in presence of the veiled portrait; it must be all cleared away at the end, except the glass belonging to the dead person, and his portion of bread, which must be set before the portrait. In the evening, at the hour for the regular visit, we must repair in si lence to the chamber, light a clear fire of cypress-wood and cast incense seven times thereon, pronouncing the name of the person whom we desire to behold. The la mp must then be ex tinguished, and the fire permitted to die out. On this day the portrait must not be unveiled. When the flame dies down, put more incense on th e ashes and invoke God according to the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"72 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic forms of that religion to which the dead person belonged, and according to the ideas which he himself possess ed of God. While making th is prayer, we must iden- tify ourselves with the evoked person, speak as he spoke, believe in a sense as he believed. Then, after a silence of fifteen minutes, we must speak to him as if he were present, with affection and with faith, praying him to appear before us. Renew this prayer mentally, covering the face with both hands; then call him thrice with a loud voice; remain kneeling , the eyes closed or covered, for some minutes; then call again thrice upon him in a sweet and affectionate tone, and slowly open the eyes. Should nothing result, the same experiment must be renewed in the following year , and if necessary a third time, when it is certain that the desired apparition will be obtained, and the longer it has been delayed the more realistic and st riking it will be. Evocations of knowledge and intelligence are performed with more solemn cer- emonies. If concerned with a celebrated personage, we must meditate for twenty- one days upon his life and writings, form an idea of his appearance, converse with him mentally and imagine his answers. We must carry his portra it, or at least his name, about us, following a ve getarian diet for twenty-one days and a severe fast during the last seven. We must next co nstruct the magical oratory, described in the thirteenth chapter of our “Doctrine”, and see that all light is excluded there- from. If, however, the proposed operation is to take place in the day-time, we may leave a narrow aperture on the side where the sun will shine at the hour of evoca- tion, place a triangular pr ism before this opening a nd a crystal globe filled with water facing the prism. If the experiment has been arranged for night, the magic lamp must be so situated that its single ray shall fa ll upon the altar smoke. The purpose of these preparations is to furnish the Magic Ag ents with elements of cor- poreal appearance, and to ease as much as possible the tens ion of imagination, which could not be exalted without danger in to the absolute illu sion of dream. For the rest, it will be understood easily that a beam of sunlight or the ray of a lamp coloured variously and falling upon curling and irregular smoke can in no way create a perfect image. The ch afing-dish containing the sacred fire should be in the centre of the oratory and the altar of perfumes hard by. The operator must turn towards the east to pray, and the we st to invoke; he must be either alone or assisted by two persons preserving the stri ctest silence; he mu st wear the magical vestments, which we have de scribed in the seventh chap ter, and must be crowned with vervain and gold. He should bath e before the operation, and all his under- garments must be of the mo st intact and scrupulous cleanliness. The ceremony should begin with a prayer suited to the genius of the spirit about to be invoked and one which would be approved by him self if he still lived. For example, it would be impossible to evoke Voltaire by reciting prayers in the style of St. Bridget. For the great men of antiquity , we may use the Hymns of Cleanthes or Orpheus, with the oath termi nating the Golden Verses of Pythagoras. In our evo-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"NECROMANCY 73 cation of Apollonius, we used the Magica l Philosophy of Patricius for the Ritual, containing the doctrines of Zoroaster and the writings of Hermes Trismegistus. We recited the Nuctemeron of Apollonius in Greek wi th a loud voice and added a Conjuration beginning: “Let the Father of all be Counsellor a nd thrice-great Her- mes guide.” For the evocation of spirits belonging to religions issued from Judaism, the fol- lowing Kabalistic Invocation of Solomon should be used, either in Hebrew or in any other tongue with which the spirit in question is known to have been familiar: Powers of the Kingdom, be ye under my left foot and in my right hand! Glory and Eternity, take me by the two shoulders, and direct me in the paths of victory! Mercy and Justice, be ye the equilibrium and splendour of my life! Intelligence and Wisdom, crown me! Spirits of Malkuth, lead me betwixt the two Pillars upon which rests the whole edifice of the Te mple! Angels of Netsah and Hod, establish me upon the cubic stone of Yesod! O Gedulae l! O Geburael! O Tiphereth! Binae l, be ye my love! Ruach Hoch- mael, be thou my light! Be that which thou are and thou shalt be, O Keth eriel! Ishim, assist me in the name of Shaddai! Cherubim, be my strength in the name of Adonai! Be ni-Elohim, be my brethren in the name of the Son, and by the powers of Zebaoth! Eloim, do batt le for me in the nam e of Tetragrammaton! Melachim, protect me in the name of Yod He Vau He ! Seraphim, cleanse my l ove in the name of Elvoh! Hashmalim, enlighten me with the splendours of Eloi and Shekinah! Ar alim, act!

It should be remembered, above all in conjurations, that the names of Satan, Beelzebub, Adramelek and others do not de signate spiritual uni ties but legions of impure spirits. “Our name is legion, for we are many,” says the spirit of darkness in the Gospel. Number constitutes law, and progress takes place inversely in hell as the domain of anarchy. That is to say, the most advanced in Satanic develop- ment and consequently the most degraded and the least intelligent and feeblest. Thus, a fatal law drives demons downward when they wish and believe them- selves to be ascending. So also those who term thems elves chiefs are the most impotent and despised of all. As to the horde of pe rverse spirits, they tremble before an unknown, invisible, incompre hensible, capricious , implacable chief, who never explains his laws, whose arm is ever stretched out to strike those who fail to understand him. They give this phantom the names of Baal, Jupiter and even others more venerable, which cannot, without profanation, be pronounced in hell. But this phantom is only the shadow and remnant of God, disfigured by wil- ful perversity, and persisting in imaginati on like a visitation of justice and a remorse of truth. When the evoked spirit of light manifests with sad or irritated countenance, we must offer him a moral sacrifi ce, that is, be inwardly disposed to renounce what- ever offends him; and before leaving th e oratory, we must dismiss him, saying:"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"74 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic “May peace be with thee!

In the first place, a pit was dug, at the mouth of which they cut the th roat of a black sheep; the psyllae and larvae presumed to be present, and sw arming round to drink the blood, were driven off with the magic sword; the tr iple Hecate and the infernal gods were evoked, and the phan tom whose apparition was de sired was called upon three times. In the Middle Ages, necromancers violated tombs, composing philtres and unguents with the fat and bl ood of corpses combined with aconite, belladonna and poisonous fungi. They boiled and skimmed these frightful compounds over fires fed with human bones and crucifixes stolen from churches; they added dust of dried toads and ash of consecrated host s; they anointed their temples, hands, and breasts with the infernal unguent, traced diabolical Pantacles, evoked the dead beneath gibbets or in deserted grave yards. Their howlings were heard from afar, and belated travellers imagined that legions of phantoms rose out of the earth. The very trees, in their eyes, assumed appallin g shapes; fiery orbs gleamed in the thickets; frogs in the marshes seemed to echo mysterious words of the Sab- bath with croaking voices. It was the m agnetism of hallucination and the conta- gion of madness. The end of procedure in Black Magic wa s to disturb reason and produce the feverish excitement which emboldens to great crimes. The Grimoires, once seized and burnt by authority everywhere, are certainly not harmless books. Sacrilege, murder, theft, are indicated or hinted as means to realization in almost all these works. Thus, in the Grand Grimoire and its modern version the Red Dragon, there is a recipe entitled “Com position of Death, or Phi losophical Stone”, a broth of aqua fortis , copper, arsenic and verdigris. Th ere are also necromantic processes, comprising the tearing up of earth from graves with the nails, dragging out bones, placing them crosswise on the breast, then assisting at midnig ht mass on Christ- mas eve, and flying out of the church at the moment of consecration, crying: “Let the dead rise from their tombs!” Therea fter the procedure involves returning to the graveyard, taking a handful of earth ne arest to the coffin, running back to the door of the church, which has been ala rmed by the clamour, depositing the two bones crosswise and again shouting: “Let th e dead rise from their tombs!” If the operator escapes being seized and shut up in a madhouse, he must retire at a slow pace, and count four thousa nd five hundred steps in a straight line, which means following a broad road or scaling walls. Having traversed this space, he lies down"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"NECROMANCY 75 upon the earth, as if in a coffin, and repeats in lugubr ious tones: “Let the dead rise from their tombs!” Finally, he calls thrice on the person whose apparition is desired. No doubt anyone who is mad en ough and wicked enough to abandon himself to such operations is predisposed to all chimer as and all phantoms. Hence the recipe of the Grand Grimoire is most efficacious, but we advise none of our readers to test it."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"76 CHAPTER XIV TRANSMUTATIONS S T . A UGUSTUS speculates, as we have said, whether Apuleius could have been changed into an ass and then have re sumed his human shap e. The same doctor might have concerned himself equally with the adventure of the comrades of Ulysses, transformed into sw ine by Circe. In vulgar opinion, transmutations and metamorphoses have always been the very essence of Magic. Now, the crowd, being the echo of opinion, which is queen of the world, is ne ver perfectly right or entirely wrong. Magic does change the nature of things , or rather modifies their appearances at pleasure, according to the strength of the operator's will and the fascination of ambitious adepts. The spok en word creates its form, and when a person held infallible confers a name upon a given thing, the latter is really trans- formed into the substance signified by the name. The master piece of speech and of faith in this order is the real transmuta tion of a substance without change in its externals. Had Apollonius offered a cup of wine to his disciples, and said to them: “This is my blood, of which ye shall dr ink hence-forth to perpetuate my life within you”; and had his disciples throug h centuries believed that they effected transformation by repeating the same words; had they taken the wine, despite its odor and taste, for the re al, human and living blood of Apollonius, we should have to acknowledge this ma ster in theurgy as the most accomplished of enchant- ers and most potent of all the Magi. It would rema in for us then to adore him. Now, it is well known that mesmerists impart for their somnambulists any taste that they chose to plain water; and if we assume a Magus with sufficient com- mand over the astral fluid to magneti ze at the same momen t a whole assembly of persons, otherwise prepared for magneti sm by extreme super-excitement, we shall"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"TRANSMUTATIONS 77 be in a position to explain readily, no t indeed the Gospel miracle of Cana but works of the same class. Are not the fasc inations of love, which result from the universal Magic of Nature, truly prodigious , and do they not actually transform persons and things? Love is a dream of en chantments that transfigures the world; all becomes music and fragrance, all intoxi cation and felicity. The beloved being is beautiful, is good, is subl ime, is infallible, is radi ant, glows with health and happiness. When the dream e nds we seem to have fallen from the clouds; we are inspired with disgust for the brazen so rceress who took the place of the lovely Melusine, for the Thersites wh om we deemed was Achilles or Nereus. What faith is that which we cannot inspire in those wh o love us? But also what reason or jus- tice can we instill into those who have fi nished with such love ? Love begins magi- cian and ends sorcerer. After creating the illusions of heaven on earth, it realizes those of hell. Its hatred is absurd like its ardour, becau se it is passional, that is, subject to the fatalities of its own influences. For this cause it has been proscribed by sages, who declare it the enemy of reas on. Are they to be envied or commiser- ated for thus condemning, doubtless with out understanding, the most alluring of miscreants? All that can be said is that when they spoke thus, either they had not yet loved or else they loved no longer. Things that are external are for us what our word internal makes them. To believe that we are happy is to be happy; whatsoev er we esteem becomes precious in proportion to the estimat ion itself: this is the sense in which we can say that Magic changes the nature of things. The M ETAMORPHOSES of Ovid are true, but they are allegorical, like the G OLDEN A SS of rare Apuleius. The life of beings is a progressive transformation, and its forms ca n be deter-mined, renewed, prolonged further, or destroyed sooner . If the doctrine of metemp sychosis were true, might one not say that the debauc h represented by Circe real ly and materially changes men into swine, seeing that, on this hypothesis, the retribution of vices would be a relapse into animal forms corresponding thereunto? Now, metempsychosis, which has been misinterpreted frequently, has a perfectly true side; for animal forms communicate their sympathetic impressions to the astral body of man, which reacts speedily on his line aments according to the fo rce of his habits. A man of intelligent and passive mildness assum es the inert physiognomy and ways of a sheep, but in somnambulism it is a sheep that is seen, and not a man with a sheepish countenance, as the ecstatic and learned Swedenborg experienced a thousand times. In the kabali stic book of Daniel the see r, this mystery is repre- sented by the legend of Nebuchadnezzar changed into a beast, which, after the common fate of magical allegor ies, has been mistaken for an actual history. In this way, we can really transform men into animals and animals into men; we can metamorphose plants and alter their virt ue; we can endow mi nerals with ideal properties: it is all a ques tion of willing. We can equa lly render ourselves visible or invisible at will, and this enables us to explain the my steries of the Ring of Gyges."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"78 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic In the first place, let us remove from the mind of our readers all supposition of the absurd – that is, of an effect devoi d of cause or contra dicting its cause. To become invisible one of three things is necessary – the interposition of some opaque medium between the light and ou r body, or between our body and the eyes of the spectators, or the fascination of the eyes of the spectators in such a manner that they cannot make use of th eir sight. Of these met hods, the third only is magical. Have we not al l of us observed that un der the government of a strong preoccupation we look without seeing and collide with objects in front of us? “So do, that seeing they may no t see,” said the Great Initiat or, and the history of this Grand Master tells us that one day, finding Himself on the point of being stoned in the Temple, He became invisi ble and went out. There is no, need to reproduce the mystifications of popular Grimoires about the ring of invisibility. Some specify that it shall be composed of fixed mercury, enriched by a small stone which is indispensable to find in a pe wit's nest, and kept in a bo x of the same metal. The author of the Little Albert ordains that this ring should be composed of hairs torn from the head of a raging hy ena, which recalls the histor y of the bell of Rodilard. The only writers who have di scoursed seriously of the Ri ng of Gyges are Jambli- chus, Porphyry and Peter of Apono. What they say is evidentl y allegorical, and the representation which they give, or that which can be drawn from their description, proves that they are speaking in reality of nothing but the Great Mag- ical Arcanum. One of the figures depict s the universal movement, harmonic and equilibrated in imperishable being; anot her, which should be formed from an amalgam of the seven metals, calls for a de scription in detail. It has a double col- let and two precious stones – a topaz cons tellated under the sign of the sun and an emerald under the sign of the moon. It sh ould bear on the i nner side the occult characters of the planets and on the ou ter their known signs, duplicated and in kabalistic opposition to each other; that is, five on the right and five on the left; the signs of the sun and moon resuming th e four several intelligences of the seven planets. Now, this configurat ion is no other than that of a Pantacle signifying all mysteries of magical doctrine , and here is the occult significance of the ring: to exercise omnipotence, of whic h ocular fascination is one of the most difficult dem- onstrations to give, we must possess all science and know how to make use of it. Fascination is accomplished by magne tism. The Magus inwardly forbids a whole assembly to see him, and it does not see him. In this manner he passes through guarded gates and comes out of pris on in the face of his petrified gaolers. At such times a strange numbness is experi enced, and they recall having seen the Magus as if in a dream, but never till after he has gone. The whole secret of invis- ibility consists therefore in a power which is capable of defini tion – being that of distracting or paralysing at tention, so that light reac hes the visual organ without impressing the eye of the soul. To exer cise this power we must possess a Will accustomed to sudden and energetic acti ons, great presence of mind and skill no"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"TRANSMUTATIONS 79 less great in causing divers ions among the crowd. Let a man, for example, who is being pursued by his intending murderers, dart into a side street, return immedi- ately, and advance with perfect calmn ess towards his pursuers, or let him mix with them and seem intent on the chase, and he will certainl y make himself invis- ible. A priest who wa s being hunted in ' 93 , with the intention of hanging him from a lamp-post, fled down a certain street, assumed a stooping gait, and leaned against a corner with an intensely preocc upied expression; the crowd of his ene- mies swept past; not one saw him, or rather, it never struck anyone to recognize him: it was so unlikely to be he! The person who desire s to be seen always makes himself observed, but he who would rema in unnoticed efface s himself and disap- pears. The true Ring of Gyg es is the will; it is also the wand of transformations, and by its precise and strong formulatio n it creates the magical word. The omnip- otent terms of enchantments are those which express this creative power of forms. The Tetragram, which is the supreme word of Magic, signifies: “It is that which it shall be,” and if we apply it to any tr ansformation whatsoever with full intelli- gence, it will renew and modify all thin gs, even in the teet h of evidence and com- mon sense. The hoc est of the Christian sacrifice is a translation and application of the Tetragram: hence this simple ut terance operates the most complete, most invisible, most incredible and most clearly affirmed of all transformations. A still stronger word than that of transformation has been judged necessary by councils to express the marvel – that of transubstantiation. The Hebrew terms xnxv , 'sg' , xvx' , ia' , have been considered by all Kaba- lists as the keys of magical transformation. The Latin words, est , sit , esto , fiat , have the same force when pronounced with full understanding. Montalembert relates seriously, in his legend of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, how one day this saintly lady, surprised by her noble husb and, from whom she sought to conceal her good works, in the act of carrying br ead to the poor in her apron, told him that she was carrying roses, and it prove d on investigation that she had spoken truly; the loaves had changed into roses. This story is a most gracious magical apologue, and signifies that the truly wise man cannot lie, that the word of wis- dom determines the form of things, or even their substance independently of their forms. Why, for example, should not the noble spouse of St. El izabeth, a good and firm Christian like herself, and believing implicitly in the Real Presence of the Saviour in true human body upon an altar where he beheld only a wheaten host, why should he not believe in the real pr esence of roses in his wife's apron under the appearances of bread? She exhibited him loaves undo ubtedly, but as she had said that they were roses, and as he believed her inca pable of the smallest false- hood, he saw and wished to see roses on ly. This is the secret of the miracle.

Below this figure we re ad a frank and simple inscription – T HE D EVIL . Yes, we confront here that phantom of all terrors, the dr agon of all theogo- nies, the Ahriman of the Persians, the Typho n of the Egyptians, the Python of the Greeks, the old serpent of th e Hebrews, the fantastic monster, the nightmare, the Croquemitaine, the gargoyle, the great be ast of the Middle Ages, and – worse than all these – the Baphomet of the Templars, the bearded idol of the alchemist, the obscene deity of Mend es, the goat of the Sabbath. The frontispiece to this “Ritual” reproduces the exact figure of the terrible emperor of nigh t, with all his attributes and all his characters. Let us state now for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction of M. le Comte de Mirville, for the justification of the demonologist Bodin, for the greater glory of the Church, which persecuted Templars, burnt magicians, excommuni- cated Freemasons, etc. – let us state boldly and precisely that all inferior initiates of the occult science and profaners of th e Great Arcanum, not only did in the past but do now, and will ever, adore what is signified by this alarming symbol. Yes, in our profound conviction, the Grand Mast ers of the Order of the Templars wor- shipped the Baphomet, and caused it to be worshipped by their initiates; yes, there existed in the past, and there may be still in the present, assemblies which are presided over by this fi gure, seated on a throne and having a flaming torch between the horns. But the adorers of this si gn do not consider, as do we, that it is a representation of the devil: on the cont rary, for them it is that of the god Pan, the god of our modern schools of philoso phy, the god of the Alexandrian theurgic school and of our own myst ical Neo-platonists, the god of Lamartine and Victor Cousin, the god of Spinoza an d Plato, the god of the prim itive Gnostic schools; the Christ also of the dissident priesthood. This last qualif ication, ascribed to the goat of Black Magic, will not astonish stud ents of religious antiquities who are acquainted with the phases of symbolism and doctrine in their various transfor- mations, whether in India, Egypt or Judea. The bull, the dog and the goat are the three symbolical an imals of Hermetic Magic, resuming all the trad itions of Egypt and India. The bull represents the Earth or Salt of the Philosophers; the dog is Hermanubis, the Mercury of the sages – otherwise, fluid, air and water; the goat represents fire and is at the same time the symbol of generation . Two goats, one pure and on e impure, were consecrated in Judea; the first was sacrifi ced in expiation for sins; th e other, loaded with those sins by imprecation, was set at liberty in the desert – a strange ordinance, but one"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"82 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic of deep symbolism, signifyi ng reconciliation by sacrific e and expiation by liberty! Now, all the fathers of th e Church, who have concern ed themselves with Jewish symbolism, have recognized in the immolated goat the figure of Him Who assumed, as they say, the very form of sin. Hence the Gnostics were not outside symbolical traditions when they assigned this same myst ical figure to Christ the Liberator. All the Kabalah a nd all Magic, as a fact, ar e divided between the cultus of the immolated and that of the emissa ry goat. We must recognize therefore a Magic of the Sanctuary and that of th e wilderness, the White and the Black Church, the priesthood of public ass emblies and the Sanhedr im of the Sabbath. The goat which is represented in our fronti spiece bears upon its forehead the Sign of the Pentagram with one point in the a scendant, which is sufficient to distin- guish it as a symbol of the light. Moreover , the sign of occultism is made with both hands, pointing upward to the white moon of Chesed, an d downward to the black moon of Geburah. This sign expresses th e perfect concord between mercy and jus- tice. One of the arms is fe minine and the other mascul ine, as in the androgyne of Khunrath, those attributes we have comb ined with those of our goat, since they are one and the same symbol. The torch of intelligence burning between the horns is the magical light of universal equilibrium; it is also the type of the soul, exalted above matter, even while cle aving to matter, as the flam e cleaves to the torch. The monstrous head of the anim al expresses horror of si n, for which the material agent, alone responsible, mu st alone and for ever bear the penalty, because the soul is impassible in its nature and ca n suffer only by materializing. The cadu- ceus, which, replaces the generative or gan, represents eterna l life; the scale-cov- ered belly typifies water; the circle abov e it is the atmosphe re, the feathers still higher up signify the volatile; lastly, humanity is depict ed by the two breasts and the androgyne arms of this sphinx of th e occult sciences. Behold the shadows of the infernal sanctuary dissipated! Behold the sphinx of mediaeval terrors unveiled and cast from his throne! Quomodo cedidisti, Lucifer ! The dread Baphomet hencef orth, like all monstrous idols, enigmas of antique science and its dreams, is only an i nnocent and even pious hieroglyph. How should man adore the beast, since he ex ercises a sovereign power over it? Let us affirm, for the honour of humanity, that it has never worshipped dogs and goats any more than lambs or pigeons. In the hieroglyphic orders, why not a goat as much as a lamb? On the sacred stones of Gnostic Christians of the Basilidean sect there are representations of Christ under the diverse fi gures of kabalistic animals – sometimes a bird, at others a lion, and again a serpent wi th the head of lion or bull; but in all cases He bears invariably th e same attributes of light, even as our goat, which cannot be confo unded with fabulous images of Satan, owing to the Sign of the Pentagram. Let us affirm categorically, to combat the remnants of Manichaeanism which are appearing sporadically among Christia ns, that as a superior personality and"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE SABBATH OF THE SORCERERS 83 power Satan does not exist. He is the personification of al l errors, perversities and consequently of all weaknesse s. If God may be defined as He Who exists of neces- sity, may we not define His antagonist a nd enemy as necessaril y he who does not exist at all? The absolute affirmation of good implies an absolu te negation of evil: so also in the light, shadow itself is luminous. Thus, er ring spirits are good to the extent of their participation in being a nd in truth. There ar e no shadows without reflections, no nights without moon, the pl anet of morning and stars. If hell be just, it is good. No one has ever blas phemed God. The insults and mockeries addressed to His disfigured images attain Him not. We have named Manichaeanism, and it is by this monstrous heresy that we shall explain the aberration s of Black Magic. The misco nstrued doctrine of Zoro- aster and the magical law of two forces constituting universal equilibrium, have caused some illogical minds to imagine a negative divinity, subordinate but hostile to the active Deity. An impure duad comes thus into being. Men were mad enough to halve God; the Star of Solomon was separated into triangles, and the Manichaens imagined a trinity of night. This evil God, product of sectarian fancies, inspired all manias and all crimes. Sanguinary sacrifices were offered him; monstrous idolatry replaced the true religion; Black Magi c traduced the Transcendent and Luminous Magic of true adepts, and horrible conven ticles of sorcerers, ghouls and stryges took place in caverns or desert places, for dementia soon changes into frenzy and from human sacrifices to cannibalism there is only one step. The Mysteries the Sabbath have been described variously, but they figure always in Grimoires and in magical trials. The revelations made on the subject may be classified under three heads: 1 . those referring to a fantastic and imaginary Sabbath; 2 . those which betray the secrets of certain occult assembli es of veritable adepts; 3 . revela- tions of foolish and criminal gatherings, having for thei r object the operations of Black Magic. For a large number of un happy men and women, given over to such mad and abominable prac tices, the Sabbath was but a prolonged nightmare, where dreams appeared realities and were induced by means of potions, fumiga- tions and narcotic frictions. Baptista Port a, whom we have sign alized already as a mystifier, gives in his Natural Magic , a pretended recipe for the sorcerers' unguent, by means of which they were tr ansported to the Sabbath. It is a compo- sition of child's fat, acon ite boiled with poplar leav es and some other drugs, the whole mixed with soot, whic h could not contribute to th e beauty of the naked sor- ceresses who repaired to the scene anointed with this made. There is another and more serious recipe given the same author , which we transcribe in Latin to pre- serve its grimoire character. Recipe: suim, acorum vulg are, pentaphyllon, versper- tillionis sanguinem, sola num somniferum et oleum , the whole boiled and incorporated to the consistence of an unguent. We infer that compositions con- taining opiates, the pith of green hemp, Datura stramonium or Iaurel-almond,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"84 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic would enter quite as successfully into such preparations. The fat or blood of night-birds added to these narcotics, with black magical ceremonies, would impress imagination and determine th e direction of dreams. To Sabbaths dreamed in this manner we must refer the accounts of a goat issuing from pitchers and going back into them after the ceremo ny; infernal powders obtained from the ordure of this goat, who is called Master Leonard; ba nquets where abortions are eaten without salt and boiled with serpen ts and toads; dances, in which mon- strous animals or men and women with impossible shapes take part; unbridled debauches where incubi project cold sp erm. Nightmare alone could produce or explain such scenes. The unfortunate curé Gaufridy and his abandoned penitent Madeline de la Palud went mad through kindred delusions, and were burned for persisting in affirming them. We must read the depositio ns of these diseased beings during their trial to understand the extent of the aberration possible to an afflicted imagination. But the Sabbath wa s not always a dream; it did exist in reality; even now there are secret nocturna l assemblies for the pr actice of the Rites of the old world, some of which have a re ligious and social ob ject, while that of others is concerned with orgies and conjurat ions. From this two-fold point of view we propose to consider the true Sabbath, that of luminous Magic in the one case and that of dark ness in the other. When Christianity proscribed the public exercise of the an cient worships, the partisans of the latter were compelled to m eet in secret for the celebration of their mysteries. Initiates presi ded over these assemblies an d soon established a kind of orthodoxy among the varietie s of persecuted worships, this being facilitated by the aid of magical tr uth and by the fact that pro scription unites wills and forges bonds of brotherhood betw een men. Thus, the Myster ies of Isis, of Ceres Eleusinia, of Bacchus, combined with th ose of the Bona Dea and primeval Druid- ism. The meetings took place usually between the days of Mercury and Jupiter, or between those of Venus and Saturn. The proceedings included Rites of Initiation, exchange of mysterious signs, singing of symbolical hymn s, the communion of feasting in common, the successive formati on of the magical chain at table and in the dance. Finally the meeting broke up af ter renewing pledg es in the presence of chiefs and receiving instructions from them. The candidate for the Sabbath was led or rather carried to the assembly, hi s eyes covered by th e magical mantle in which he was enveloped completely. He was passed before great fires, while alarming noises were made about him. When his face was uncovered, he found himself surrounded by inf ernal monsters and in the presence of a colossal and hideous goat which he was commanded to adore. All these ce remonies were tests of his force of character and confidence in his initiators. The final ordeal was most decisive of all because it wa s at first sight hu miliating and ridiculous to the mind. The candidate received a brusque command to kiss respectfully the posterior of the goat. If he refused, hi s head was covered once more , and he was transported to"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE SABBATH OF THE SORCERERS 85 a distance from the assembly with such extraordinary rapidity that he believed himself whirled through the air. If he agreed, he wa s taken round the symbolical idol, and there found, not a repulsive and obscene object, but the young and gra- cious countenance of a pri estess of Isis or Maia, who gave him a sisterly salute, and he was then admitted to the banque t. As to the orgies which in many such assemblies followed the banquet, we must be ware of believing that they were per- mitted generally th ese secret agapae, it is known, however, that a number of Gnostic sects practised them in their conventicles durin g early centuries of Chris- tianity. That the flesh had its protestants in those ag es of asceticism and compres- sion of the senses was inevitable and can occasion no surprise, but we must not accuse Transcendental Magic of irregulariti es which it has never authorized. Isis is chaste in her widow hood; Diana Pant hea is a virgin; Hermanubis, possessing both sexes, can satisfy neither; the H ermetic hermaphrodite pure; Apollonius of Tyana never yielded to the seductions of pleasure; th e Emperor Julian was a man of rigid continence; Plotinus of Alexandria was ascetic in the manner of his life; Paracelsus was such a stranger to fool ish love that his sex was suspected; Raymund Lully was initiated in the final secrets of science only after a hopeless passion which made him chaste for ever. It is also a m agical tradition that panta- cles and talismans lose all their virtue wh en he who wears them enters a house of prostitution or commits an adultery. The Sabbath of or gies must not therefore be considered as that of the veritable adepts. With regard to the term Sabbath, some have traced it to the name of Sabasius, and other etymologies have been imagined. The most simple, in our opinion, con- nects it with the Jewish Sa bbath, for it is certain th at the Jews, most faithful depositaries of the secrets of the Kabala h, were almost invariably the great mas- ters in Magic during the Middle Ages. The Sabbath was th erefore the Sunday of Kabalists, the day of their religious festi vals, or rather the night of their regular assembly. This feast, surrounded with my steries, had vulgar fr ight for its safe- guard and escaped persecution by terror. As to the diabolical Sabbath of necro- mancers, it was a counterfeit of that of the Magi, an assembly of malefactors who exploited idiots and fools. There horri ble rites were practised and abominable potions compounded; there sorcerers and sorceresses laid their plans and com- pared notes for the common support of th eir reputation in prophecy and divina- tion. At that period divine rs were in general demand and followed a lucrative profession, while exercising a real power. Such institutions ne ither had nor could possess any regular rites; ever ything depended on the capr ice of the chiefs and the vertigo of the assembly. The reports of some who had been present served as a type for all nightmares of hallucination, and from this chaos of impossible reali- ties and demoniac dreams have issued the revolting and foolis h histories of the Sabbath which figure in magical processes and in the books of such writers as Sprenger, Delancre, Delrio and Bodin."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"86 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic The Rites of the Gnostic Sabbath were imported into Germany by an associa- tion which took the name of Mopses. It replaced the kabalistic goat by the Her- metic dog, and the candidates, male or female – for the order initiated women – were brought in with eyes bandaged. Th e same infernal noise was made about them which surrounded the name of Sabbath with so many inexplicable rumours; they were asked whether they were afraid of the devil, and were required abruptly to choose between kissing the posterior of the Grand Master a nd that of a small silk-covered figure of a dog, which was substituted for the old grand idol of the Goat of Mendes. The sign of recognition was a ridiculo us grimace, which recalls the phantasmagoria of the an cient Sabbath and the masks of its myrmidons. For the rest, their doctrine is summed up in the cultus of l ove and licence. The associ- ation came into existence when the Ro man Church was persec uting Freemasonry. The Mopses pretended to recruit only am ong Catholics, and for the penal pledge at reception they substituted a solemn engagement upon honour to reveal no secrets of the order. It was more effect ual than any oath and silenced religious objections. The name of the Templar Baphomet, wh ich should be spelt kabalistically backwards, is composed of three abbreviations: Tem. ohp. AB., Templi omnium hominum pacts abbas , “the father of the temple of peace of all men”. According to some, the Baphomet was a monstrous he ad, but according to others, a demon in the form of a goat. a sculptured coffer was disinterred recent ly in the ruins of an old Commandery of the Temple, a nd antiquaries observed upon it a bap- hometic figure, corresponding by its at tributes to the goat of Mendes and the androgyne of Khunrath. It was a bearded fi gure with a female body, holding the sun in one hand and the moon in the other, attached to chains. Now, this virile head is a beautiful allegor y which attributes to thought alone the initiative and creative principle. Here the head represents spirit and the body matter. The orbs enchained to the human form, and directed by that Nature of which intelligence is the head, are also magnificently allegori cal. The sign all the same was discovered to be obscene and diabolical by the le arned men who examined it. Can we be astonished after this at the spread of mediaeval superstition in our own day?

But we have not yet exhibited these impiou s devices in all thei r turpitude, in all their monstrous folly. We must stir up the blood-stained fi lth or perished supersti- tions; we must tax the anna ls of demonomania, so as to explore certain crimes which imagination alone could not invent . The Kabalist Bodi n, Israelite by con- viction and Catholic by necessity, had no other intention in his Demonomania of Sorcerers than to impeach Catholicism in its works and undermine it in the great- est of all its doctrinal abuses. The trea tise of Bodin is profoundly Machiavellian and strikes at the heart of the institutio ns and persons it appears to defend. It would be difficult to concei ve without reading it his vas t mass of sanguinary and hideous histories, acts of revolting superstition, senten ces and executions of stupid ferocity. “Burn all!” the inquisitors s eemed to cry. “God wi ll distinguish His own!” Poor fools, hysterical women and id iots were accordingly sacrificed without mercy for the crime of Magic, while, at the same time, great criminals eluded this infamous and sanguinary justice.

It is an almost unknown abomination, an d one which has not, so far as we are aware, tempted the skil l of any romancer, even at peri ods of the most feverish and deplorable literature.

The infernal operation was performed in the following way. Aa child was selected, of beautiful appearance and innocent manners; he wa s prepared for his first communion by the almoner of the palace. When the day or rather night of the sacrifice arrived, a monk, an apostate Jacobin, given over to the occult works of Black Magic, cele- brated a Mass of the Devi l at midnight in the sick-r oom, in the presence only of Catherine de Medicis and he r trusted confidants. It was offered before the image of the demon, having a cruc ifix upside down under its feet and the sorcerer conse- crated two hosts, one black and one white. The white was given to the child, who was brought in clothed as fo r baptism, and was murdered on the steps of the altar immediately after his communion. His head , cut by one blow from the body, was set palpitating upon the gr eat black host which covered the bottom of the paten, and then transported to a table where mysterious lamps were burning. The exor- cism began, an oracle was besought of th e demon, and an answer by the mouth of the head to a secret ques tion which the King dared not make aloud and had con- fided to no one. a strange and feeble voice, which had nothing human about it, was heard presently in the poor little martyr's head, saying in Latin: Vim patior – “I suffer violence”. At this reply, whic h doubtless announced to the sick man that hell no longer protected him, a horrible trembling seized the monarch, his arms stiffened and he cried in a hoarse voice: “Away with that head! Away with that head!” and so continued screaming till he gave up the ghost. His attendants, who were not in the confidence of this frightful mystery, beli eved that he was pursued by the phantom of Coligny and that he saw the head of the illustrious admiral. That which tormented the dy ing man was not, however, a remorse but the hope- less terror of an anticipated Hell. This darksome magical legend of Bodi n recalls the abominable practices and deserved fate of Gilles de Laval, Lord of Retz, who passed from asceticism to Black Magic and offere d the most revolting sacrifices to conciliate the favour of Satan. This madman confessed at his tr ial that Satan had appeared to him fre- quently, but had always de ceived him by promises of treasures which he had never delivered.

The folly of sorcerers was an evil folly, and one of their chief ends was the power of bewitch- ments or harmful influences. We have set down in our “Doctrine” what we think upon the subject of bewitchment, and ho w it seems to us a dangerous and real power. The true Magus bewitches without ceremonial and by his mere reprobation those whom he condemns and considers it necessary to punish; his forgiveness even bewitches those who do him wrong, and never do the enemies of initiates carry far the impunity of their injusti ce. We ourselves h ave witnessed numerous examples of this fatal law. The murderers of martyrs always perish miserably, and the adepts are martyrs of intelligen ce; Providence seems to scorn those who despise them and to slay those who would de prive them of life. The legend of the Wandering Jew is the popular poetry of this arcanum. A Wise Man was driven by a nation to His doom; it bade Him “Go on!” when He sought to rest for a moment. What is the consequence? A similar condemnation overtakes the nation itself; it is proscribed bodily. Men have cri ed to it: “Get on! Get on!” for centuries, and it has found no pity and no repose. A man of learning had a wife whom he loved wildly and passionately, in the exaltation of his tenderness; he honoured her with blind conf idence and trusted her entirely. Vain of her beauty and un derstanding, this wo man became jealous of her husband's superiority and began to ha te him. Some time after she deserted him, disgracing herself with an old, ug ly, stupid and immoral man. This was the beginning of her punishment, but it did no t end there. The man of learning pro- nounced solemnly the following sentence upon her: “I take back your understand- ing and your beauty.” A year after she wa s no longer recognized by those who had known her; she was disfigured by obes ity and reflected in her countenance the hideousness of her new affections. Three years later she was ugly; seven years later she was deranged. This happened in our own time, and we were acquainted with both persons. The Magus condemns after the manner of the skilful physician, and for this reason there is no appeal from his sen tence when it has been once pronounced against a guilty person. There are no ceremonies and no invocations; he does but abstain from eating at the same table, or if forced to do so neither accepts nor offers salt. But the bewitchments of so rcerers are of another kind, and may be compared to an actual poisoning of some cu rrent of Astral Ligh t. They exalt their will by ceremonies till it becomes venomous at distance; but, as we have observed"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"94 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic in our “Doctrine”, they expo se themselves more often to be the first that are killed by their infernal machinery. Let us stigmatize at this point some of their guilty proceedings. They procure hair or garments of the person whom they seek to destroy; they select an animal which seems to them symbolic of the person, and by means of the hair or gar ments they place it in magn etic connexion with him or her. They give it the same name and then slay it with one blow of the magic knife. They cut open the breast, tear out the hear t, wrap while still palpitating, in the magnetized objects and hourly, for the spa ce of three days, they drive nails, red- hot pins, or long thorns therein, pron ouncing malediction upon the name of the bewitched being. They are pe rsuaded, and often rightly, that the victim of their infamous operations experiences as many tortures as if his own heart had been pierced at all points. He begins to waste away and dies af ter a time of an unknown disease. Another bewitchment, made us e of by country people, consists in consecration of nails to works of hatred by means of the stinking fumiga tions of Saturn and invocations of evil genii. They follow the footsteps of the person whom it is sought to torment, and drive the nails cross-wise into every imprint of his feet which can be traced upon the earth or sand. Yet another and more abominable practice. A fat toad is selected; it is baptized; the name and su rname of the person to be bewitched is given it; it is made to swallow a Consecrated Host over which the for- mulae of execration have been pronounc ed. The animal is then wrapped in mag- netized objects, bound with the hairs of the victim, upon which the operator has previously spat, and is buried at the thr eshold of the bewitche d person's door, or at some point where he is obliged to pa ss daily. The elementar y spirit of the toad will become a nightmare and vampire, ha unting the dreams of the victim, unless indeed he should know how to dr ive it back on the operator. Let us pass now to bewitchments by w axen images. The sorcerers of the Middle Ages, eager to please by th eir sacrileges him whom they regarded as their master, mixed baptismal oil and ashes of Cons ecrated Hosts with a modicum of wax. Apostate priests were never wanting to deliver them the treasures of the Church. With the accursed wax they formed an image as far as po ssible resembling the person whom they desired to bewitch. They clothed this image with garments similar to his; they admi nistered to it the sacrame nts which he received; they called down upon its head al l maledictions which could express the hatred of the sorcerer, inflicting daily imaginary tortur es upon it, so as to reach and torment by sympathy the person whom the image represented. This bewitchment is more infallible if the hair, blood and above all a tooth of the victim can be procured. It was this which gave rise to the proverb ial saying: You have a tooth against me – meaning, you bear me a gr udge. There is also bewitc hment by the glance, called the jettatura or evil eye in Italy. During our civil wa rs, a shopkeeper had the mis- fortune to inform against one of his neighbours, who aft er a period of detention"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"WITCHCRAFT AND SPELLS 95 was set at liberty, but with his position lost. His sole vengeance was to pass twice daily the shop of the info rmer, whom he regarded fixe dly, saluted and went on. Some little time after, th e shopkeeper, unable to bear the torment of his glance any longer, sold his goods at a loss a nd changed his neighbourhood, leaving no address. In a word, he was ruined. A threat is a real bewitchment, because it acts powerfully on the imagination, above all when the latter is open readil y to belief in an occult and unlimited power. The terrible menace of hell, th at bewitchment of humanity, during so many centuries, has created more nightm ares more nameless diseases, more furi- ous madness, than all vices and all excesses combined. Th is is what Hermetic art- ists of the Middle Ages represented by the incredible and unheard-of monsters which they carved about th e doorways of basilicas. But bewitchment by threat produces an effect altogether contrary to the intentions of th e operator when it is evidently vain intimidation; when it does outrage to the legitimate pride of the menaced person and consequent ly provokes his resistance; or finally, when it is ridiculous by its atrocity. The sectaries of hell have discredited heaven. Say to a reasonable man that equilibr ium is the law of motion a nd life, that liberty, which is moral equilibrium, rests upon an et ernal and immutable distinction between true and false, between good and bad; tell him that, endowed as he is with free will, he must place himself by his works in the emp ire truth and goodness, or slide back eternally like the rock Sisyphus, into the chaos of falseh ood and evil; then he will understand the doctrine, and if yo u term truth and goodness heaven, false- hood and evil hell, he will believe in your heaven and hell, over which the Divine Ideal rests calm, perfect and inaccessible to either wrath or offence, because he will understand that if in prin ciple hell be eternal as li berty, it cannot in fact be more than a temporar y agony souls, because it is an expiation, and the idea of expiation necessarily supposes that of repa ration and destruction of evil. This said, not with dogmatic intention, which is outside our province, but to indicate the moral and reasonable remedy for the bewitchment of consciences by the ter- rors of the life beyond, le t us speak of the means of escaping the baleful influences of human wrath. The first am ong all is to be reasonable and just, giving no oppor- tunity or excuse to anger. A legitimate indignation is greatly to be feared; make haste therefore to acknowledge and expiat e your faults. Should anger persist after that, then it certainly proceeds from vi ce; seek to know what vice and unite your- self strongly to the magnetic currents of the opposite virtue. The bewitchment will have no further power upon you. Wash ca refully the clothes which you have fin- ished with before giving them away; otherwise, burn them; never use a garment which has belonged to an unknown person without purifying it by water, sulphur and such aromatics as camp hor, incense, amber, etc. A potent means of resisting bewitchment is not to fear it; it acts after the man- ner of contagious maladies.

As for the wise – and it is time that we turned to them after making an allow- ance for the foolish – they have scarcely an y sorceries to fear s ave those of fortune; but seeing that they are priests and physi cians, they may be called upon to cure the bewitched, an d this should be their method of procedure. They must persuade such a person to do some act of goodness to his tormentor, render him some ser- vice which he cannot refuse, and lead hi m directly or otherwise to the communion of salt. A person who belie ves himself bewitched by th e execration and interment of the toad must carry abou t him a living toad in a ho rn box. For the bewitchment of the pierced heart, the afflicted indivi dual must be made to eat a lamb's heart seasoned with sage and onion, and to ca rry a Talisman of Venus or of the Moon in a satchel filled with camphor and salt. For bewitchment by the waxen figure, a more perfect figure must be made, and set about as far as possible with things belonging to the person; seven talismans must be hung round th e neck; it must be placed in the middle of a great Pantac le representing the Pentagram, and each day must be rubbed slightly with a mixt ure of oil and balm, after reciting the Conjuration of the Four to turn aside the influence of elementa ry spirits. At the end of seven days the image must be bur nt in consecrated fire, and one may rest assured that the figure fabric ated by that sorcerer will at such moment lose all its virtue. We have mentioned already the Sympathe tic Medicine of Paracelsus, who med- icated waxen limbs and operated upon discharges of blood from wounds for the cure of wounds themselves. This system permitted the employment of more than usually violent remedies, a nd the chief specifics were sublimate and vitriol. We believe that homoeopathy is a reminisce nce of the theories of Paracelsus and a return to his wise practices. But we shall follow up this subject in a special treatise consecrated to occult medicine. Contracts by parents forest alling the future of their children are bewitchments which cannot be condemned too strongly; ch ildren dedicated in white, for exam- ple, scarcely ever prosper; those who were formerly devoted to celibacy fell com- monly into debauch, or ended in despai r and madness.

The natura l mandragore is a fila- mentous root which presents mo re or less as a whole eith er the figure of a man, or that of the virile members. It is slightly narcotic and an aphrodisiacal virtue was ascribed to it by the ancients, who repr esented it as being sought by Thessalian sorcerers for the composition of philtres. Is this root th e umbilical vestige of our terrestrial origin, as a certain magical mysticism has suggested? We dare not affirm it seriously, but it is true all the same that ma n issued from the slime of earth and his first appearance must have been in the fo rm of a rough sketch. The analogies of Nature compel us to admit the notion, at least as a possibility. The first men were, in this case, a family of gigantic, sensitive mandragores, animated by the sun, who rooted themselves up fr om the earth. Such an assumption not only does not exclude, but on the contra ry positively suppo ses, creative will and the providential co-operation of a First Cause, which we have R EASON to call G OD . Some alchemists, impressed by this idea, indulged in reveries on the culture of the mandragore and experimented in the arti ficial reproduction of a soil suffi- ciently fruitful and a sun sufficiently ac tive to humanize the said root, and thus create men without the concurrence of the female. Others, who regarded human- ity as the synthesis of an imals, despaired about vitalizing the mandragore, but they crossed monstrous pai rs and projected human seed into animal earth, only for the production of shameful crimes and barren deformities. The third method of making the android was by galvanic ma chinery. One of these almost intelligent automata was attributed to Albertus Magnus, and it is said that St. Thomas destroyed it with one blow from a stic k because he was perplexed by its answers. This story is an allegory: the android was primitive sc holasticism, which was bro- ken by the S UMMA of St. Thomas, that daring i nnovator who first substituted the absolute law of reason for arbitrary di vinity, by formulatin g an axiom which we cannot repeat too often, sin ce it comes from such a ma ster: “A thing is not just because God wills it, but God wi lls it because it is just.” The real and serious android of the anci ents was a secret wh ich they have kept hidden from all eyes, and M esmer was the first who dared to divulge it.

When they compared the calm and pe aceful immensity of heaven, thronged with immovable lights, to the tumults and darkness of this world, the ancients believed themselves to have discovered in that beautiful book, written in letters of gold, the final utterance of th e enigma of destinies. In imagination they drew lines of correspondence between these shining poin ts of divine writing; and it is said that the first constellations marked out by the shepherds of Chaldea were also the first letters of the kabali stic alphabet. These characters, expresse d first of all by means of lines, then enclosed in hier oglyphic figures, would, according to M. Moreau de Dammartin, author of a very curious treatise on alphabetic characters, have determined the ancient Magi in the choice of th e Tarot figures, which are considered by this man of learning, as by ourselves, an e ssentially hieratic and primitive book. Thus, in his opinion, the Chinese T SEU , the Hebrew A LEPH and the Greek A LPHA expressed hieroglyphically by th e figure of the juggler, would be borrowed from the constellation of the Crane, in the vicinity of the celestial Fish, a sign of the eastern hemisphere.

It was included in the work of Montfaucon on the religions and superstitions of the world, and also in the treatise upon Magic published by th e mystic Eckartshausen. Scholars, moreover, are not agreed upon the configuration of the lett ers of the primitive al phabet. The Italian Tarot, of which the lost Gothic originals are much to be regretted, connects by the disposition of its figures with the Hebrew alphabet in use after the captivity, and known as the Assyrian alphab et; but there are fragments of anterior Tarots where the disposition is different. There should be no conjecture in matters of research, and hence we suspend our j udgement in the expectation of fresh and more conclu- sive discoveries. As to the alphabet of the stars, we be lieve it to be instinctive, like the configuration of clo uds, which seem to assume any form that imagination lends them. Star-groups are like points in geomancy or the figures of cartomancy. They are a pretext for auto-magnetism, an instrument to fix and determine native intuition. Thus, a Kabalist, familiar with mystic hieroglyphics, will perceive signs in the stars which wi ll not be discerned by a simple shepherd, but the shepherd, on his part, will observe co mbinations that will escap e the Kabalist. Country peo- ple substitute a rake for the belt and sw ord of Orion, while a Kabalist recognizes in the same sign – consider ed as a whole – all the myst eries of Ezekiel, the Ten S EPHIROTH arranged in a triadic manner, a central triangle formed of four stars, then a line of thre e stars making the J OD , the two figures taken together express- ing the mysteries of B ERESHITH , and finally, four stars constituting the wheels of M ERCAVAH , and completing the divine chariot. Looked at after another manner, and postulating other ideal lines, he will notice a well-formed G HIMEL placed above J OD , in a large D ALETH , a symbol typifying the st rife between good and evil, with the final triumph of good. As a fact, the G HIMEL superposed on the J OD is the triad produced by unity, the manifestatio n of the Divine Word , whilst the reversed D ALETH is the triad composed of the evil dua d multiplied by itself. Thus regarded, the figure of Orion would be identical with that of the angel Michael doing battle with the dragon, and the appearance of this sign, so understood, would be, for the Kabalist, a portent of victory and happiness. A long contemplation of the sky exalts imagination, and then the stars respond to our thoughts. The lines drawn mental ly from one to another by primitive observers have given man his first notions of geometry. Accordingly as our soul is troubled or at rest, the stars seem burni ng with menace or sp arkling with hope. The sky is thus the mirror of the huma n soul, and when we think that we are reading in the stars it is in ourselves we read."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"100 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic Gaffarel, applying the presages of celest ial writing to the destinies of empires, says that not in vain did the ancients place all signs of evil augury in the northern region of the sky; calamities have been in all ages regarded as coming from the north to spread themselves over the earth by the invasion of th e south. “For this reason,” he tells us, “the ancients repres ented in the northern parts of the heaven a serpent or dragon near two bears, since these animals are the true hieroglyphs of tyranny, pillage and all oppression. As a fa ct, glance at history, and you will see that all great devastations proceed from the north. The Assyrians or Chaldeans, incited by Nebuchadnezzar or Salmanasor, gave fullest evidence of this truth by the destruction of the most splendid and most holy te mple and city in the uni- verse, and by the complete overthrow of a people whom God Himself had taken under His special protection and of whom He termed Himself Father especially. So also that other Jerusalem, Rome the blessed, has it not too experienced fre- quently the violence of this evil northern race, when it beheld its altars demol- ished and the towers of its proud edif ices brought level with the foundations, through the cruelty of Alar ic, Genseric, Attila and other princes of the Goths, Huns, Vandals and Alani.. . .

He states, for the rest, that he derived his predic tions from a Hebrew Kabalist, Rabbi Chomer, but does not pretend to understand him especially well.

Take a black card; cut therein the name of the person for whom you wish to make the consulta- tion; place this card at th e end of a tube which must diminish towards the eye of the observer; then look through it alternately towards the four cardinal points, beginning at the east and fi nishing at the north. Take note of all the stars which you see through the letters; convert these letters into num bers, and, with the sum of the addition writ ten down in the same manner, renew the operation; then com- pute the number of stars you have next, a dding this number to that of the name; cast up again and write the sum of the tw o numbers in Hebrew characters. Renew the operation; inscribe separately the stars which you have noticed; find the names of all the stars in the planisphere; classify them according to their size and brightness, choosing the most brilliant of all as the pole-star of your astrological operation; find lastly, in the Egyptian pl anisphere, the names and figures of the genii to which these stars belong. A good example of the planis phere will be found in the atlas to the great work of Dupuis. You will learn in this manner the fortu- nate and unfortunate signs enter into the name of the person, and what is their influence; whether in childhood, which is the name traced at the east; in youth, which is the name traced at the south; in mature age, which is the name at the west; in decline, which is the name at the north; or finally, during the whole life, obtained from the stars which enter into the entire number formed by the addi- tion of letters and stars. This astrological operation is simple, easy and calls for few calculations; it connects with the hi ghest antiquity and belongs evidently to primitive patriarchal Magic, as will be se en by studying the works of Gaffarel and his master Rabbi Chomer. Onomantic astr ology was practised by the old Hebrew Kabalists, as is proved from their obs ervations by Rabbi Chomer, Rabbi Kapol, Rabbi Abjudan and other masters in Kabalah. The menaces of the prophets uttered against various nations were based upon the characters of the stars found vertically over them in the permanent co rrespondence of the celestial and terres- trial spheres. Thus, by writing in th e sky of Greece the Hebrew name of that country nwv or gnv , and translating in numbers, th ey obtained the word ChRB, which signifies destroyed, desolated. ——— h\u0001w\u0001k 2 2 8 CHARAB Destroyed, Desolated Sum 12 ————"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"106 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic u\u0001n\u0001v 5 6 1 JAVAN Greece Sum 12 ——— Hence they inferred that after a cy cle of twelve peri ods Greece would be destroyed and desolated. A sh ort time before the sack of Jerusalem and its temple by Nebuchadnezzar, the Kabalists remarked eleven stars disposed in the following manner vertically above the temple: * * * * * * * *  * * * All these entered into the word xvehx written from south to west, the term sig- nifying reprobation and abandonment wi thout mercy. The sum of the number of the letters is 423 , exactly the period of the duration of th e temple. Destruction threatened the empires of P ersia and Assyria, in the sh ape of four ve rtical stars which entered into the three letters hnw , Roev, and the fatal period indicated was 208 years. So also four stars announced to the kabalistic rabbins of another epoch the fall and division of the empire of Alexander; they entered into the word owq , PARAD = to divide = 284 , the number of this word, i ndicating the entire duration of the said empire, both as to root and branches. Acco rding to Rabbi Chomer, the destinies of the Ottoman power at Consta ntinople would be fixed and foretold by four stars, entering into the word x'j , CAAH, signifying to be feeble, weak and drawing to its end. The star s being more brilliant in th e letter Aleph, indicated a capital, and gave it the numerical value of a thousand. The three letters combined make 1025 , which must be computed from the taking of Constantinople by Maho- met II, a calculation which still promises several centur ies of existence to the enfeebled empire of the sultans, sustained at present by all Europe combined. The M ANE T HECEL P HARES which Belshazzar, in his intoxication, saw written on the wall of his palace by the glare of torche s, was an onomantic intuition similar to that of the rabbins. Initiated, no doubt, by his Hebrew diviners in the reading of the stars, Belshazzar went to work mechanically and in stinctively upon the lamps of his nocturnal east, as he would upon the stars of heaven. The three words which he had formed in his imagination soon became indelible to his eyes and paled all the lights of his banquet.

Here was Apuleius beguiled, like the companions of Ulysses, and underwent a humiliating metamorphosis. Here all is magical – th e birds that fly, the insects humming in the grass, even the trees a nd flowers. Here in the m oon-light are brewed those potions which compel love; here spells are devised by st ryges to render them young and lovely like Charite s. O all ye youths, beware! The art of poisoning reason, otherwise the art of philtres, seems indeed, if tra- ditions may be trusted, to have developed its venomous effl orescence more abun- dantly in Thessaly than elsewhere. There also magnetism played its most important part, for stimulat ing or narcotic plants, be witched and harmful animal substances, derived all their power from enchantments – th at is to say, from sacri- fices accomplished and words pronounced by sorcerers when preparing philtres and beverages. Inflaming substances, a nd those in which phosphorus predomi- nates, are naturally aphrodisiacal. Anythi ng which acts strongly on the nervous system may induce impassioned exaltation , and when a skilful and persevering will knows how to direct and influence these natural tendencies, it can use the desires of others to the profit of its own, and will soon reduce the most indepen- dent personalities into inst ruments of its pleasures. From such influence it behoves us to seek protection , and to give arms to the weak is our purpose in writ- ing this chapter. Here, in the first plac e, are the devices of the enemy. The man who seeks to compel love – we attribute such unlawfu l manoeuvres to men only, assuming that women can never have need of them – must in the first place make himself observed by the person whom he desires and must contrive to impress her imagination. He must inspire her with ad miration, astonishment, terror, and even with horror, failing all other resources; but at any cost he mu st set himself apart in her eyes from the rank of ordinary men and, with or against her will, must make himself a place in he r memory, her apprehensions, her dreams. The type of Love- lace is certainly not the admitted ideal of the type of Clarissa, but she thinks of him incessantly to condemn him, to execrate him, to compassion ate his victims, to desire his conversion and repentance. Next she seeks his regene ration by devotion and forgiveness. Later on secret vanity wh ispers to her how grand it would be to fix the affections of a Lovelace, to love him and yet to withstand him. Behold, then, Clarissa surprised into loving Lovelace! She chides herself, blushes, renounces a thousand times a nd loves him a thousand mo re. Then, at the supreme moment, she forgets to resist him. Had angels been women, represented by mod- ern mysticism, Jehovah inde ed would have acted as a wise and prudent Father by placing Satan at the gate of heaven. It is a serious imposition on the self-love of some amiable women to find that man fundamentally good and honourable who"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"PHILTRES AND MAGNETISM 109 enamoured them when they thought him a scapegrace. The angel leaves him dis- dainfully, saying: “You are not the devil!” Play the devil as well as you can, if you wish to allure an angel. No licence is possible to a vi rtuous man. “For what does he take us?” say women. “D oes he think us less strict than he is?” But everything is forgiven in a rascal. “What else coul d you expect?” The part of a man with high principles and of rigid character can ne ver be a power save with women whom one wishes to fascinate: the rest, without exception, adore reprobates. It is quite the opposite with men, and this contrast has made mo desty woman's dower, the first and most natural of her coquetries. One of the distingu ished physicians and most amiable men of learni ng in London – Dr. Ashburner – told me last year that a certain client, afte r leaving the hous e of a distinguished la dy, observed to him: “I have just had a strange compliment fr om the Marchioness of ____. Looking me straight in the face, she said: ‘Sir, you will not make me flinch before your terrible glance: you have the eyes of Satan.’” “Well,” answered the doctor, smiling, “you, of course, put your arms round her neck and embraced her?” “Not at all; I was overwhelmed by her sudden on slaught.” “Beware how you call on her again, then, my friend; you will have fall en deeply in her estimation!” The office of executioner is commonly said to go down from father to son. Do executioners really have children? Undoubte dly, as they never fail to get wives. Marat had a mistress who loved him tenderly – he, the loathsome leper; but still it was that terrible Marat who caused the world to tremble. L ove, above all in a woman, may be termed a veri table hallucination; for want of a prudent motive, it will frequently select an absurd one. D eceive Joconde for a clown, how awful! – Ah! but supposing it is awful, why not p erpetrate it? It must be pleasant to be occasionally guilty of a small abomination. Given this transcendental knowledge of woman, another device can be adopted to attract her notice – not to concern onesel f with her, or to do so in a way which is humiliating to her self-love, treating he r as a child and deri ding all notion of paying court to her. The parts are then reversed; she will move heaven and earth to tempt you; she will initiate you into secrets which women keep back; she will vest and unvest before you, making su ch observations as: “Between women– among old friends–I have no fear about you–you are not a man for me.” etc. Then she will watch your expression; if she find it calm and indifferent, she will be indignant; she will approach you under so me pretext, brush you with her tresses, permit her bodice to slip op en. Women, in such cases, o ccasionally will risk a vio- lence, not out of desire, but from curios ity, from impatience and irritation. a magician of any spirit will need no other philtres than these; he will also use flat- tering words, magnetic breathings, slig ht but voluptuous co ntacts, by a kind of hypocrisy and as if unconsci ous. Those who resort to po tions are old, idiotic, ugly, impotent. Where, indeed, is the use of th e philtre?

It woul d be a sovereign blunder to attempt the conquest of a young and affec tionate bride during the first felicities of the honeymoon, or of a fort ified Clarissa made misera ble already by a Lovelace, or bitterly lamenting her love. We shall not discuss here the impurities of Black Magic; the subject of philtres: we have done with the coct ions of Canidia. The epodes of Horace tell us after what manner this abominable Roman so rceress compounded her poisons, while for the sacrifices and enchantments of love , we may refer to the Eclogues of Virgil and Theocritus, where the ceremonials fo r this species of magical work are described minutely. No r shall we need to reproduce the recipes of the Grimoires or of the L ITTLE A LBERT , which anyone can consult for themselves. All these various practices connect with magn etism or poisonous magic and are either foolish or criminal. Potions which enfeeble mind an d disturb reason establish the empire already acquired by an evil will, and it wa s thus that the empress Caesonia is said to have fixed the savage love of Caligula. Prussic acid is the most terrible agent in these envenomings of thought; hence we should beware of all extractions with an almond flavour, and never tolerate in be dchambers the presence of bay-cherry, Datura stramonium, almond-soaps or wa shes, and generally all perfumes in which this odour predominat es, above when its action on the brain is seconded by that of amber. To weaken the activity of intelligence is to strengthen proportionally the forces of unreasoning passion. Love of that ki nd which the malefactors we are concerned with would inspire is a veritable stupefaction and the most shameful of moral bondages. The more we enervate a slave , the more incapable we make him of freedom, and here lies the true secret of the sorceress in Apuleius and the potions of Circe. The use of tobacc o, by smoking or otherwise, is a dangerous auxiliary of stupefying philtres and brain poisons. Ni cotine, as we know, is not less deadly than prussic acid and is present in tobacco in larger quantities than is this acid in almonds. The absorption of one will by another freque ntly changes a whole series of destinies, and not for ourselves only sh ould we watch our relations, learning to distinguish pure from impur e atmospheres, for the true philtres, and those most dangerous, are invisible. Such are the curr ents of vital radiat ing light, which, min- gling and inter-changing, produce attractio ns and sympathies, as magnetic exper- iments leave no room to doubt. The histor y of the Church tells us that an arch- heretic named Marcos infatuated all women by breathing on them; but his power was destroyed when a valiant Christian fe male forestalled him in breathing, and said to him: “May God judge thee!” Th e Curé Gaufridy, who was burnt as a sor- cerer, pretended to enamour all women wh o came in contact with his breath. The notorious Father Girard, a Jesuit, was accused by his penitent, Mlle. Cardier, of destroying her self-control by breathing on her. Such a pretext was necessary to minimize the horrible and ridi culous nature of her accu sations against this priest,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"PHILTRES AND MAGNETISM 111 whose guilt, moreover, has never been we ll established, though, consciously or unconsciously, he had certainly inspired an exceedingly shameful passion in the miserable girl. “Mlle. Ranfaing, having become a widow in 16 —,” says Dom Calmet in his Treatise on Apparitions, “was sought in marriage by a phys ician named Poirot. Failing to obtain a hearing, he there upon gave her potions to induce love, and these caused extraordinary derangements in the health of the lady, increasing to such a degree that she was believed to be possessed, so that other physicians, baf- fled by her case, recommended her for the exorcisms of the Church. Thereupon, by command of M. de Porcelets, Bishop of Toul, the followin g were named as her exorcists: M. Viardin, doctor in theology , the state councillor of the Duke of Lor- raine, a Jesuit and a capuchin. But in the long course of these ceremonies, almost all the clergy of Nancy, the aforesaid Lord Bishop, the Bi shop of Tripoli, suffragan of Strasbourg, M. de Nancy, formerly am bassador of the most Christian King at Constantinople and then prie st of the Oratory, Charles of Lorraine, Bishop of Ver- dun, two Sorbonne doctors specially depute d to assist, exorcise d her frequently in Hebrew, in Greek and in Latin, and she invariably replied to them pertinently, though she herself could scarcely read even the last language. Mention is made of the certificate given by M. Nicholas de Harlay, learned in the Hebrew tongue, who recognized that Mlle. Ranfaing was real ly possessed, that she had answered the mere motion of his lips without any uttered words, and given numerous other proofs. The sieur Gamier, doctor of the So rbonne, having also adjured her several times in Hebrew, she replied lucidly, but in French, sayi ng that the pact bound her to speak an ordinary tongue. The demon adde d: ‘Is it not sufficient for me to show that a understand what you say?’ The same doctor, addressing him in Greek, inadvertently used one case for anot her, whereupon the possessed woman, or rather the devil, said: ‘You have blundere d.’ The doctor replie d in Greek, ‘Point out my error.’ The devil answered, ‘Be sati sfied that I mention the mistake: I shall tell you no more.’ The doctor bade him be silent in Greek, and he retorted, “You bid me hold my tongue , but for myself I decl ine to be silent.’” This remarkable example of hysterical affection carried into the region of ecstasy and demonomania, as the consequence of a potio n administered by a man who believed that he was a sorcerer, proves better than any argument the omnip- otence of will and imagination reacting one upon another, and the strange lucidity of ecstatics or somnambulis ts, who comprehend speech by reading it in thought, though they do not understand the words. I make no question as to the sincerity of the witnesses c ited by Dom Calmet; I am merely astonished that men so serious failed to notice the prete nded demon's difficul ty over answering in a tongue for- eign to the sufferer. Had their interlocut or been what they meant by a demon, he would have spoken as well as understood Greek: the on e would have been as easy as the other to a spirit so acute and lear ned. Dom Calmet does not stop here with"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"112 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic his history; he enumerates a long series of in sidious questions and trivial injunc- tions on the part of the exorcisers, a nd a sequence of more or less congruous replies by the poor sufferer, still ecstatic and somnambulistic. It is needless to add that the excellent father draws precisely the luminous conclusi ons of the not less excellent M. de Mirville. The phenomena being above the co mprehension of the witnesses, they were all ascribed to perdit ion. Brilliant and in structed conclusion! The most serious part of th e business is that the physici an Poirot was arraigned as a magician, confessed like al l others under torture, and was burnt. Had he, by any potion, really attempted the reason of the woman in question, he would have deserved punishment as a poisoner: this is the most that we can say. But the most terrific of all philtres are the mystical exaltations of misdirected devotion. Will ever any impurities equal th e nightmares of St. Anthony or the tor- tures of St. Theresa and St. Angela de Foligny? The last applied a red-hot iron to her rebellious flesh, and fo und that the material fire was cooling to her hidden ardours. With what violence does Nature cr y out for that which is denied her, but is brooded over continually to increase detestation thereof! The pretended bewitchments of Magdalen Bavan, of Mlles. de la Palud and de la Cadière, began with mysticism. The excessive fear of a given thing makes it almost invariably inevitable. To describe the two curves of a circle is to meet at the same point. Nicholas Remigious, criminal judge of Lorraine, who burnt alive eight hundred women as sorcerers, beheld Magic everywher e: it was his fixed idea, his mania. He was eager to preach a crusade against sorc erers, with whom Eu rope, in his opin- ion, was swarming; in despair that his wo rd was not taken when he affirmed that nearly everyone in the world had been guilty of Magic, he ended by declaring that he was himself a sorcerer and wa s burned on his own confession. To preserve ourselves against in fluences, the first conditio n is to forbid excite- ment to the imagination. All who are pron e to exaltation are more or less mad, and a maniac is ever governed by his mania. Place you rself therefore above puer- ile fears and vague desires; believe in s upreme wisdom and be assured that this wisdom, having given you understanding as the means of knowledge, cannot seek to lay snares for your intelligence or re ason. Everywhere ab out you are effects proportioned to their causes; causes ar e directed and modified by understanding in the realm of humanity; in a word, you will find goodness stronger and more respected than evil: why then should you assume an immense unreason in the infinite, seeing that there is reason in the finite? Truth is hidden from no one. God is visible in His works, and He requires nothing contrary to its nature from any being, for He is Himself the author of that nature. Faith is confidence; have confi- dence, not in men who malign reason, for they are fools or im postors, but in that eternal reason which is the Divine Word, that true ligh t which is offered like the sun to the intuition of every human creature coming into this wo rld.

The denary of Pythagoras and the triad multiplied by itself represent wisdom in its application to the Absolute. It is with the Absolute therefore that we are concerned here. To discover such Absolu te in the infinite, the indefinite and the finite, is the Great Work of the sag es, that which is te rmed by Hermes the Work of the Sun. To find the immovable foundations of true religious faith, of philosophical truth and of me tallic transmutation, here is the whole secret of Her- mes and here the Philosophical Stone. This Stone is both one and manifold: it is decomposed by analysis and recomposed by synthesis. In analys is it is a powder, the alchemical powder of projection; before analysis and in synthesis it is a stone. The Philosophical Stone, say the masters, must not be exposed to the air, nor to the eyes of the profane; it must be ke pt in concealment and preserved carefully in the most secret receptacle of the laborato ry, the key of the place being always car- ried upon the person. He who possesses the Great Arcanum is truly king and is indeed above any king, for he is inaccessible to all fears an d to all vain hopes. In any malady of soul and body, a single fragment broken from th e precious Stone, a single grain of the divine powder are more than sufficient for their cure. “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,” as the Master said. Salt, Sulphur and Mercury are only ac cessory elements a nd passive instru- ments of the great enterprise. Everything depends, as we have said, upon the inte- rior magnes of Paracelsus. The work consists entirely in Projection, and Projection is accomplished p erfectly by the effective a nd realizable intelligence of a single word. There is but one import ant operation, and th at is Sublimation, which is nothing less, according to Geber, than the elevation of the dry substance by means of fire, with adherence to its proper vessel. Wh osoever would acquire understanding of the Great Word and po ssess the Great Arcanum, after studying the principles of our “Doctr ine”, should read the Hermetic philosophers carefully, and he will doubtless attain initiation, as others have attained it; but for the key of their allegories he must take the one d ogma of Hermes, contai ned in the “Emerald Table”, while to classify the knowledge an d direct operation he must follow the order indicated in the kabalistic alphabet of the Tarot, of which an absolute and complete explanation will be given in the last chapter of this work. Among the rare and priceless treatises wh ich contain the mysteries of the Great Arcanum, the “Chemical Pathway or Manual” of Paracelsus must be placed in the first rank, as comprising all the mysteries of demons trative physics and the most secret Kabalah.

This catechism, which we point out to instructed Kabalists as a substitute for the incomparable treatise of Paracel sus, expounds all the essential principles of the Great Work in a form so clear a nd complete that a pe rson must be abso- lutely wanting in the quality of occult co mprehension if he fail in attaining the absolute truth by its study. We shall no w give a succinct anal ysis of this work, together with a few words of commentary. Raymond Lully, one of the grand and sublime masters of science, says that before we can make gold we must have gold. Out of nothing we can make noth- ing; wealth is not created absolutely: it is increased and multiplied. Hence let aspirants to knowledge understand and re alize that neither miracles nor jugglers’ feats are demanded of the adept. Hermetic Science, like all real sciences, is math- ematically demonstrable. Even its material results are as exact as a well-worked equation. Hermetic gold is not only a true doctrine, a shadowl ess light, truth unal- loyed with falsehood; it is also material, actual, pur e gold, the most precious which can be found in the veins of the eart h; but the Living Gold, Living Sulphur, or true Fire of the Philosophe r, must be sought in the House of Mercury. This fire feeds on air; to ex press its attractive and expansive power, a better comparison is impossible than that of ligh tning, which primally is a dry and terrestrial exhala- tion united to humid vapour, and afterwar ds, assuming an igne ous nature, in vir- tue of its exaltation, acts on its inhe rent humidity, which it attracts and transmutes into its own nature , when it falls rapidly to earth, where it is drawn by a fixed nature similar to its own. The se words, enigmatic in form but clear in essence, express openly wh at the philosophers understand by their Mercury fructi- fied by Sulphur, which becomes the mast er and regenerator of Salt. It is A ZOTH , universal magnesia, the Great Magical Agent, the Astral Light, the light of life, fertilized by animic force, by intellectual energy, which they compare to Sulphur on account of its affinities w ith Divine Fire. As to Salt, it is absolute matter. All that is material contains Salt, and all Salt can be conv erted into pure gold by the combined action of Sulphur and Mercury, which at times ac t with swiftness that transmutation can take place in an instan t or in an hour, without labour for the operator and almost withou t expense. At oth er times, when the tendencies of the atmospheric media are adverse, the operat ion requires several days, months, and occasionally even years. As we have said, there are two palmar y natural laws – two essential laws – which, balanced against another, produc e the universal equilibrium of things. These are fixity and motion, analogous to truth and discovery in philosophy, and in absolute conception to necessity and li berty, which are the very essence of God. The Hermetic philosophe rs give the name of fixed to al l that is ponderable, to all that tends by its nature towards centra l rest and immobility.

They become masters in this manner of all Nature, and their Stone is found wherever there is Salt, which is the equivalent to saying that no substance is foreign to the Great Work and that even the most apparently contemptible and vile matters can be changed into gold, which is true in this sense, as we have said, that all contain the fundamental Salt, represented in our emblems by the cubic stone itself, as may be seen in the symbolic and uni- versal frontispiece to the K EYS of Basil Valentine. To know how to extract from all matter the pure Salt which is co ncealed in it is to possess the secret of the Stone. It is therefore a saline stone, which the Od, or universal Astral Light, decomposes or recomposes. It is one and many, for it can be dissolved and incorporated with other substances, like ordinary salt. Obta ined by analysis, it may be termed the U NIVERSAL S UBLIMATE ; recovered by the synthetic way, it is the veritable P ANACEA of the ancients, for it cures all diseases, whether of soul or body, and is termed in an eminent manner the Medicine of all Na ture. When, by means of absolute initi- ation, we can dispose of the forces of the Universal Agent, this Stone is always to our hand, for its extraction is then a si mple and easy operation, far different from projection or metallic realization. The St one in its sublimated state must not be exposed to the air, which might dissolve it and spoil its virtue. Moreover, to inhale its exhalations is not devoid of danger. Th e wise man more readily conserves it in the natural envelopes, knowing that he can extract it by a single effort of his will and by a single application of the Univer sal Agent to the envelopes, which Kaba- lists term shells. To expr ess hieroglyphically this la w of prudence, the sages ascribed to their Mercury, personified in Egypt as Hermanubis, a dog's head, and to their Sulphur, represented by the Baphomet of the T emple or Prince of the Sab- bath, that goat's head whic h brought such odium upon the occult associations of the middle ages. For the mineral work, the Fi rst Matter is exclusively mi neral, but it is not a metal. It is a metallized salt. This Matt er is called vegetabl e because it resembles a fruit, and animal because it produces a ki nd of milk and blood. It contains within itself the fire by which it must be dissolved."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"117 CHAPTER XX THE THAUMATURGE W E have defined miracles as the natural effects of exceptional causes. The imme- diate action of the human wi ll upon bodies, or at least that action exercised with- out visible means, constitu tes a miracle in the physi cal order. The influence exercised upon wills or inte lligences, either suddenly or within a given time, and capable of subjugating thoughts, changi ng the most determined resolutions, paralysing the most violent passions – th is influence constitutes a miracle in the moral order. The common error concerning miracles is to regar d them as effects without causes, contradictions of Nature , sudden vagaries of the Divine Mind, not seeing that a single miracl e of this class would dest roy the universal harmony and reduce the universe to chaos. There are miracles which are impossible even for God, namely, those that involve absurdit y. Could God be absurd for one instant, neither Himself nor the world would be in existence the mome nt following. To expect from the Divine Arbi ter an effect having a disp roportionate cause, or even no cause at all, is what is called tempting God: it is casting one's self into the void. God operates by His works – in heaven by angels and on earth by men. Hence, in the circle of angelic action, the angels ca n perform all that is possible for God, and in the human circle of acti on men can dispose equally of Divine Omnipotence. In the heaven of human conceptions it is humanity which creates God, and men think that God has made them in His image becau se they have made Him in theirs. The domain of man is all corporea l and visible Nature on earth, and if he cannot rule suns and stars, he can at le ast calculate their motion, compute their distances and identify his will with thei r influence. He can modify the atmo- sphere, act up to a certain point upon th e seasons, heal or harm his neighbours, preserve life and inflict death. By the conservation of life we understand resurrec- tion in certain cases, as al ready established. The absolu te in reason and volition is the greatest power which ca n be given any man to atta in, and it is by means of this power that he performs what astoni shes the multitude under the name of mir- acles. The most perfect purity of intention is indispensabl e to the thaumaturge, and in the next place a favou rable current and unlimite d confidence. The man who has come to fear nothing and desire nothing is master of all. This is the meaning of that beautiful allegory of the Gospel, wherein the Son of God, thrice victor over the unclean spirit, receives ministration from angels in the wilderness. Nothing on earth withstands a free and rational wil l. When the wise man s ays, “I will,” it is God Himself Who wills, and a ll that he commands takes pl ace. It is the knowledge and self-reliance of the phys ician which constitute the virtue of his prescriptions, whence thaumaturgy is the only real and ef ficacious remedy. It follows that occult"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"118 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic therapeutics are apart from all vulgar med ication. It makes use for the most part of words and insufflations, and communicat es by will a diverse virtue to the sim- plest substances – water, oil, wine campho r, salt. The water of homoeopathists is truly a magnetized and enchanted water, which works by means of faith. The dynamic substances added in, so to spea k, infinitesimal qu antities are consecra- tions and signs of th e physician's will. What is vulgarly called charlatanism is a great means of real success in medi- cine, assuming that it is su fficiently skilful to inspire great confidence and to form a circle of faith. In medicine, above all, it is faith which saves. There is scarcely a village which does not possess its male or female compounder of occult medicine, and these people are – almost everywhere and always – incomparably more suc- cessful than physicians approved by the faculty. The remedies which they pre- scribe are often strange or ridiculous, but on this account are so much more effectual, for they exact and realize more faith on the part of patients and opera- tors. An old merchant of our acquaintan ce, a man of eccentr ic character and exalted religious sent iment, after retiring from bus iness, set him self to practise occult medicine, gratuitously and out of Christian charit y, in one of the Depart- ments of France. His sole sp ecifics were oil, insufflati ons and prayers. The institu- tion of a lawsuit against hi m for the illegal exercise of medicine established in public knowledge that ten thousand cures ha d been attributed to him in the space of about five years, and that the number of his believer s increased in proportions calculated to alarm all the doctors of the district. We saw also at Mans a poor nun who was regarded as slightly demented, but she healed neverthe less all diseases in the surrounding country by means of an elixir and plaster of her own invention. The elixir was taken internally, the plast er was applied outwardly, so that nothing escaped this universal panacea. The plaster never adhered to the skin save at the place where its application was necessary, a nd it rolled up and fell off by itself – such at least was a sserted by the good sister and de clared to be the case by the sufferers. This thaumaturge was also subj ected to prosecution, for she impover- ished the practice of all the doctors round about her; she was cloistered rigidly, but it was soon found necess ary to produce her at least once a week, and on the day for her consultations we have seen Sister Jane-Frances surrounded by the country folk, who had arrived overnight, aw aiting their turn, lying at the convent gate. They had slept upon the ground and tarried only to receive the elixir and plaster of the devoted sister. The remedy being the same in al l diseases, it would appear needless for her to be acquainted wi th the cases of her patients, but she lis- tened to them invariably with great atten tion and only dispensed her specific after learning the nature of the complaint. There was the magical secret. The direction of the intention imparted it s special virtue to the remedy, which was insignificant in itself. The elixir was aromatic brandy mixed with the juice of bitter herbs; the plaster was a compound analogous to theriac as regards colour and smell; it was"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE THAUMATURGE 119 possibly electuary Burgundy pitch, but whatever the substance, it worked won- ders, and the wrath of the rural folk wo uld have been visited on those who ques- tioned the miracles of their nun. Near Paris also we knew of an old thaumaturgic gardener who accomplished marvellous cure s by putting in his phials the juice of all the herbs of St. John. He had, however, a scepti cal brother who derided the sorcerer, and the poor gardener, overwhelmed by the sarcasms of this infidel, began to doubt himself, whereupon all the miracles ceased, the sufferers lost con- fidence and the thaumaturge, slandere d and despairing, di ed mad. The Abbé Thiers, curé of Vibraie, in his curious Treatise concerni ng Superstitions, records that a woman, afflicted wi th an apparently aggravated ophthalmia, having been suddenly and mysteriously cured, confessed to a priest that she had betaken her- self to Magic. She had long importuned a clerk, whom she regarded as a magi- cian, to give her a talisman that she mi ght wear, and he had at length delivered her a scroll of parchment, advising her at the same time to wash three times daily in fresh water. The priest made her give up the parchment, on which were these words: Eruat diabolus oculos tuos et repleat stercoribus loca vacantia . He trans- lated them to the good woman, who was stupefied; but, all the same, she was cured. Insufflation is one of the most important practices of occult medicine, because it is a perfect sign of th e transmission of life. To in spire, as a fact, means to breathe upon some person or thing, and we know already, by the one doctrine of Hermes, that the virtue of th ings has created words, that there is an exact propor- tion between ideas and speech, which is the first form and verbal realization of ideas. The breath attracts or repels a ccordingly as it is warm or cold. The warm breathing corresponds to po sitive and the cold breath ing to negative electricity. Electrical and nervous animals fear co ld breathing, and the experiment may be made upon a cat whose familiarities are im portunate. By fixedly regarding a lion or tiger and blowing in thei r face, they would be so st upefied as to be forced to retreat before us. Warm and prolonged insu fflation recruits the circulation of the blood, cures rheumatic and gouty pains, restores the balance of the humours and dispels lassitude. When the operator is sy mpathetic and good, it acts as a univer- sal sedative. Cold insufflation soothes pa ins occasioned by congestions and fluidic accumulations. The two breathings must therefore be used alternately, observing the polarity of the human organism and acting in a contrary manner upon the poles, which must be subjected successive ly to an opposite magnetism. Thus to cure an inflamed eye, the one which is not affected must be subjected to a warm and gentle insufflation, cold insufflatio n being practised upon the suffering mem- ber at the same distance and in the same proportion. Magnetic passes have a sim- ilar effect to insufflations, and are a real breathing by transpiration and radiation of the interior air, which is phosphorescent with vital light. Slow passes constitute a warm breathing which fortifies and ra ises the spirits; swift passes are a cold"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"120 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic breathing of dispersive nature, neutrali zing tendencies to congestion. The warm insufflation should be performed transv ersely, or from below upward; the cold insufflation is more effective when directed downward from above. We breathe not only by means of mout h and nostrils; the universal porousness of our body is a true respiratory appa ratus, inadequate undoubtedly but most useful to life and health. The extremit ies of the fingers, wh ere all nerves termi- nate, diffuse or attract the Astral Light accordingly as we wi ll. Magnetic passes without contact are a simple and slight insufflation; co ntact adds sympathetic and equilibrating impression to breathing; it is good and even necessary, to prevent hallucinations at the early stages of somn ambulism for it is a communion of Phys- ical reality which admonishes the brai n and recalls wandering imagination; it must not, however, be too prolonged wh en the object is merely to magnetize. Absolute and prolonged contact is useful when the design is incubation or mas- sage rather than magneti sm properly so called. We have given some examples of incubation from the most revered book of the Christians; they all refer to the cure of apparently obstinate lethargies, as we are led to term resurrections. Massage is still resorted to largely in the East, where it is practised with great success at the public baths. It is entirely a system of fr ictions, traction an d pressures, practised slowly along the whole exte nt of members and muscles, the result being renewed equilibrium in the forces, a feeling of co mplete repose and well-being, with a sen- sible restoration of activity and vigour. The whole power of the occult physician is in the consciousness of his will, while the whole art consists in exciting the faith of his pa tient. “If you have faith,” said the Master, “all things are possible to him who believes.” The subject must be dominated by expression, tone, gesture; co nfidence must be in spired by a fatherly manner and cheerfulness stim ulated by seasonable and sprightly talk. Rabelais, who was a greater magician than he see med, made pantagruelism his special pan- acea. He compelled his patients to laug h, and all the remedies he administered subsequently succeeded th e better in consequence. He established a magnetic sympathy between himself and them, by means of which he imparted his own confidence and good humour; he flattered them in his prefaces, termed them his precious, most illustrious patients, and dedicated his books to them. So are we convinced the Gargantua and Pantagruel cured more black humours, more ten- dencies to madness, more atra bilious whims, at that epoch of religious animosities and civil wars, than the whole Faculty of Medicine could boast. Occult Medicine is essentially sympathetic. Reci procal affection, or at le ast real goodwill, must exist between doctor and patient. Syrups and ju leps have very little inherent virtue; they are what they become through the mutual opinion of operator and subject; hence homeopathic medicine dispenses with them and no serious inconvenience follows. Oil and wine, combin ed with salt or camphor, are sufficient for the heal- ing of all wounds and for all external frictions or soot hing applications. Oil and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE THAUMATURGE 121 wine are the chief medicamen ts of Gospel tradition. Th ey formed the balm of the Good Samaritan, and in the Apocalypse – when describing the last plagues – the prophet prays the avenging powers to spar e these substances, that is, to leave a hope and a remedy for so many wounds. What we term Extreme Unction was the pure and simple practice of the Master's Traditional Medicine, both for the early Christians and in the mind of the apostle Saint James, who has included the pre- cept in his epistle to the faithful of th e whole world. “If an y man be sick among you,” he writes, “let him ca ll in the priests of the c hurch, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.” This divine therapeutic sci- ence was lost gradually, and Extreme Unc tion came to be regarded as a religious formality, a necessary preparation for deat h. At the same time, the thaumaturgic virtue of consecrated oil could not be effaced altogether from remembrance by traditional doctrine, and it is perpetuate d in the passage of the Catechism which refers to Extreme Unction.

It is the priesthood of the Magus. But divina- tion, in general opinion, is concerned more closely wi th the knowledge of hidden things. To know the most secret thoughts of men; to penetr ate the mysteries of past and future; to evoke age by age the e xact revelation of effects by the precise knowledge of causes: this is what is univ ersally called divination. Now, of all mys- teries of Nature, the most profound is the heart of man; but at the same time Nature forbids its depth to be inaccessible. In spite of deepest dissimulation, despite the most skilful policy, she her self outlines and makes plain in the bodily form, in the light of glances, in movement s, in carriage, in voice, a thousand tell- tale indices. The perfect init iate has no need of these; he reads the truth in the light; he senses an impr ession which makes known the whole man; his glance pen- etrates hearts, though he m ay feign ignorance to disarm the fear or hatred of the wicked whom he knows too well. A man of bad conscience thinks always that he is being accused or suspecte d; he recognizes himself in a touch of collective satire; he applies it in toto to himself, and cries loudly that he is traduced. Ever suspi- cious, but as curious as he is apprehensi ve, in the presence of the Magus he is like Satan of the parable, or like those scribes who questioned tempting. Ever stub- born and ever feeble, what he fears above all is the recognition that he is in the wrong. The past disquiets hi m, the future alarms him; he seeks to compound with himself and to believe that he is a good and well-dis posed man. His life is a per- petual struggle between am iable aspirations and evil ha bits; he thinks himself a philosopher after the manner of Aristippus or Horace when accepting all the cor- ruption of his time as a n ecessity which he must suff er; he distracts himself with some philosophical pastime and assumes th e protecting smile of Mecaenas, to per- suade himself that he is no t simply a battener on famine like Verres or a parasite of Trimalcion. Such men ar e always mercenari es, even in their good works. They decide on making a gift to some public charity, and they postpone it to secure the discount. The type which I am describing is not an individual but a class of men with which the Magus is liab le to come frequently in contact, especially in our own century. Let him follow their example by mistrustin g them, for they will be invariably his most compromising friends and most dangerous enemies. The public exercise of divination is derogat ory at the present period to a verita- ble adept, for he would be frequently driven to jugglery and sleight of hand in order to keep his clients and impress hi s public. Accredited diviners, both male and female, have always secret spies, who instruct them as to the private life or habits of those who consult them.

The divination of events to come is possi ble only in the case of those the real- ization of which is in some sense contai ned in their cause. The soul, scrutinizing by means of the whole nervous system the ci rcle of the Astral Light, which influ- ences a man and from him receives an influen ce; the soul of the diviner, we repeat, can comprehend by a single intuition al l the loves and hatreds which such a per- son has evoked about him; it can read his intentions in his thoughts, foresee obstacles that he will encounter, possibly the violent death whic h awaits him; but it cannot divine his private, voluntary, capricious determina tions of the moment following consultation, unless indeed the ru se of the diviner itself prepares the ful- filment of the prophecy. For example, you say to a woman who is on the wane and is anxious to secure a hus band: You will be present this evening or tomorrow evening at such or such a performance, and you will there see a man who will be to your liking. This man will observe you , and by a curious combination of cir- cumstances the result will be a marriage. You may count on the lady going, you may count on her seeing a man and believing that he has noticed her, you may count on he r anticipating marriage. It may not come to that in the end, but sh e will not lay the blame on you, because she would be giving up the opportunity for another illusion: on the contrary, she will return diligent ly to consult you. We have said that the Astral Light is th e great book of divinations; the faculty of reading therein is either natural or acquired, and there are hence two classes of seers, the instinctive and th e initiated. This is why children, uneducated people, shepherds, even idiots, have more aptitu de for natural divina tion than scholars and thinkers. The simple herd-boy David was a prophet even as Solomon, king of Kabalists and Magi. The percep tions of instinct are often as certain as those of sci- ence; those who are least clairvoyant in the Astral Light are those who reason most. Somnambulism is a state of pure in stinct, and hence somnambulists require to be directed by a seer of science: scepti cs and reasoners merely lead them astray. Divinatory vision operates on ly in the ecstatic state, to arrive at which doubt and illusion must be rendered impossible by enchaining or puttin g to sleep thought. The instruments of divination are hence only auto-magnetic methods and pretexts for auto-isolation from exterior light, so that we may pay attention to the interior light alone. It was for this reason that Apollonius en veloped himself completely in a woollen mantle and fixed his eyes on his navel in the dark.

Perfumes and evocations still th ought; water and the colour black absorb the visual rays; a kind of dazzlement and vertigo ensue, followed by lucidity in subjects who have a natural ap titude or are suitably di sposed in this direction. Geomancy and cartomancy are other mea ns to the same end; combinations of symbols and numbers, which are at once fo rtuitous and necessary, bear sufficient resemblance to the chances of destiny for th e imagination to perceive realities by the pretext of such emblems. The more the interest is excited, the greater is the desire to see; the fuller the confidence in the intuition, the more clear the vision becomes. To combine the points of geomancy on chance or to set out the cards for trifling purposes is to jest like children: the lots become oracles only when they are magnetized by intelligenc e and directed by faith. Of all oracles, the Tarot is the most as tounding in its answe rs, because all pos- sible combinations of this universal key of the Kabalah give or acles of science and of truth as their solutions. The Tarot was the sole book of th e ancient Magi; it is the primitive Bible, as we shall prove in the following chapte r, and the ancients consulted it as the fi rst Christians at a later date consulted the Sacred Lots, that is, Bible verses selected by chance and determined by th inking of a number. Mlle. Lenormand, the most celebra ted of our modern fortun e-tellers, was unacquainted with the science of the Tarot, or knew it only by derivation from Etteilla, whose explanations are shadows cast upon a back-ground of light. She knew neither high Magic nor the Kabalah, but her head was filled wi th ill-digest ed erudition, and she was intuitive by instinct, which deceived her rarely. The works she left behind her are Legitimist tomfoolery, orna mented with classi cal quotations; but her oracles, inspired by the presence a nd magnetism of those who consulted her, were often astounding. She was a woma n in whom extravagan ce of imagination and mental rambling were su bstituted for the natural af fections of her sex; she lived and died a virgin, lik e the ancient druidesses of the isle of Sayne. Had Nature endowed her with beauty, she migh t have played easily at a remoter epoch the part of a Melusine or a Velleda. The more ceremonies are employed in th e practice of divination, the more we stimulate imagination both in ourselv es and in those who consult us.

Metoposcopy and chiromancy have become separate sciences; their findings, purely empirical and conjectural, have been compared, examined an d combined as a body of doctrine by Goclenius, Belot, Romphilus, Indagine and Taisnier . The work of the last-mentioned writer is the most important and complete; he comb ines and criticizes th e observations and conjectures of all the others. A modern investigator, the Chevalier D'Arpentigny, has imparted to chiromancy a fresh degr ee of certitude by his remarks on the analogies which really exist between th e characters of perso ns and the form of their hands, as a wh ole or in detail. This new sci ence has been developed and ver- ified further by an artist wh o is also a man of letters, rich in originality and skill. The disciple has surpassed the master, and our amiable and spiritual Desbar- rolles, one of those travellers with wh om our great novelist Alexandre Damas delights to surround himsel f in his cosmopolitan romanc es, is quoted already as a veritable magician in chiromancy. The querent should be questioned also upon his habitual dreams; dreams are the reflection of life, both interior and exterior. They were considered with serious attention by the old philosophers; patriarc hs regarded them as certain revelations; most religious revelations have been gi ven in dreams. The monsters of perdition are nightmares of Christianity, and as the author of Smarra has observed inge- niously, never could pencil or chisel have produced such prodig ies if they had not been beheld in sleep. We should beware of persons whose imagination continually reflects deformities. Temperament is, in like manner, manifested by dreams, and as this exercises a permanent influence upon life, it is n ecessary to be well acquainted therewith, if we would conj ecture a destiny with certitude. Dreams of blood, of enjoyment, and of light indi cate a sanguine temperament; those of water, mud, rain, tears, are characterist ic of a more phlegmatic disposition; noc- turnal fire, darkness, terrors, spectres, be long to the bilious and melancholic.

St. Paul burned Trismegistus; Om ar burned the disciples of Trismegistus and St. Paul. O Persecutors! O incendiaries! O scoffers! When will ye end your work of darkness and destruction? One of the greatest Magi of the Christ ian era, Trithemius, irreproachable abbot of a Benedictine monastery, learned theo logian and master of Cornelius Agrippa, has left among his diseste emed but inestimable work s, a treatise entitled, “De Septem Secundiis”, id est intelligentiis sive spiritibus orbes post Deum moventi- bus . It is a key of all proph ecies new or old, a mathemati cal, historical and simple method of surpassing Isaiah and Jeremiah in the prevision of all great events to come. The author in bold outline sketch es the philosophy of history, and divides the existence of the entire world between seven genii of the Ka balah. It is the grandest and widest interpretation ever made of those seven angels of the Apoca- lypse who appear successively with trumpets and cups to pour out the word and its realization upon earth. The dura tion of each angelic reign is 354 years and 4 months, beginning with that of Or ifiel, the angel of Saturn, on 13 March, for, according to Trithemius, this was the date of the world's creati on; his rule answers to a period of savagery and darkness. Ne xt came the reign of Anael, the spirit of Venus, on 24 June, in the year of the world 354 , when love began to be the instruc- tor of mankind; it created the family, whil e the family led to association and the primitive city. The first civi lizers, were poets inspired by love; presently the exal- tation of poetry produced religion, fana ticism and debauchery, culminating subse- quently in the deluge. This st ate of things continued till 25 October, being the eighth month of the year A.M. 708 , when the reign of Zach ariel, the angel of Jupi- ter, was inaugurated, under whose guid ance men began to ac quire knowledge and dispute the possession of la nds and dwellings. It was al so the epoch of the founda- tion of towns and the extension of empires; its consequences were civilization and war. The need of commerce began, furt hermore, to be felt, at which time – namely, 24 February, A.M. 1063 – was inaugurated the re ign of Raphael, angel of Mercury, angel of science a nd of the word, of intellig ence and industry. Then let- ters were invented, the fi rst language being hierogl yphic and universal, a monu- ment of which has been preserved in th e Book of Enoch, Cadmus, Thoth and Palamedes, the kabalistic clavicle adopted later on by Solomon, the mystical book of the T ERAPHIM , U RIM and T HUMMIM , the primeval Genesis of the Zohar and of William Postel, the mystical wheel of Ezekiel, the R OTA of the Kabalists, the Tarot of Magi and Bohemians.

After long exhaustion, the world st rove towards a new birth under Gab- riel, the angel of the m oon, whose reign began on 28 March, A.M. 1771 , when the family of Noah multiplied and re-peopled the whole earth, after the confusion of Babel, until the reign of Michael, angel of the sun, which commenced on 24 Feb- ruary, A.M. 2126 , to which epoch must be referred the origin of the first domina- tions, the empire of the children of Nimr od, the birth of sciences and religions, the first conflicts between desp otism and liberty. Trithemi us pursues this curious study throughout the ages, and at corres ponding epochs exhibits the recurrence of ruins; then civilization, bo rn anew by means of poetry and love; empires, reconsti- tuted by the family, enlarged by commerce , destroyed by war, repaired by univer- sal and progressive civilization, absorbed subsequently by greater empires, which are syntheses of history. The work of Trith emius, from this point of view, is more comprehensive and independent than that of Bossuet and is a key absolute to the philosophy of history. His exact calculat ions lead him to the month of November in the year 1879 , epoch of the reign of Michael and the foundation of a new uni- versal kingdom, prepared by three centu ries and a half of anguish and a like period of hope, coinciding precisely wi th the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and first part of the ninet eenth centuries for the luna r twilight and expectation, with the fourteenth, thirteenth, twelfth, and second half of th e eleventh centuries for the ordeals, the ignorance, the suff erings, and the scourges of all Nature. We see therefore according to th is calculation, that in 1879 – or in twenty-four years’ time – a universal empire will be founded and will secure peace to the world. This empire will be political and religious; it will offer the solution of all problems agi- tated in our own days, and will endure for 354 years and 4 months, after which it will be succeeded by the return of the re ign of Orifiel, an epoch of silence and night. The coming universal empire, being under the reig n of the Sun, will belong to him who holds the keys of the East , which are now bein g disputed by the princes of the world’s four quarters. But intelligence and activity are the forces which rule the Sun in the superior king doms, and the nation which possesses at this time the initiative of intelligence a nd life will have also the keys of the East and will establish the universa l kingdom. To do this it may have to undergo previ- ously a cross and martyrdom analogous to th ose of the Man-God; but, dead or liv- ing, its spirit will prevai l among nations; all peoples will acknowledge and follow in four-and-twenty years th e standard of France, ever victorious or miraculously raised from the dead. Such is the prophe cy of Trithemius, confirmed by all our previsions and rooted in all our hopes."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"128 CHAPTER XXII THE BOOK OF HERMES T HE END of our work is upon us; it is here that we must give the universal key thereof and utter its final word. The universa l key of magical work s is that of all ancient religious dogmas – th e key of the Kabalah and th e Bible, the Little Key of Solomon. Now, this Clavicle, regarded as lost for centuries, ha s been recovered by us, and we have been able to open the sepulchres of the anci ent world, to make the dead speak, to behold the monuments of the past in all their splendour, to understand the enigmas of every sphinx a nd to penetrate all sanctuaries. Among the ancients the use of this key was permi tted to none but the high priests, and even so its secret was confided only to th e flower of initiates. Now, this was the key in question: ( 1 ) a hieroglyphic and numerical alpha bet, expressing by charac- ters and numbers a series of univ ersal and absolute ideas; ( 2 ) a scale of ten num- bers, multiplied by four symbols and connected with twelve figures representing the twelve signs of the zodiac; ( 3 ) Plus the four genii of the cardinal points. The symbolical tetrad, represented in the Mysteries of Memp his and Thebes by the four forms of the sphinx – man, eagle, lion and bul l – corresponded with the four elements of the old worl d, water being signified by the cup held by the man or aquarius; air by the circle or nimbus surrounding the head of the celestial eagle; fire by the wood which nourishes it , by the tree fructifying in the heat of earth and sun, finally, by the sceptre of royalty, which the lion typifies; earth by the sword of Mithras, who ea ch year immolates the sacred bull, and, together with its blood, pours forth that sap which gives increase to all fruits of earth. Now, these four signs, with all their analogies, explain the on e word hidden in all sanc- tuaries, that word which the bacchantes seemed to divine in their intoxication when they worked themselves into frenzy for I O E VOHE . What then was the mean- ing of this mysterious term? It was th e name of four primitive letters of the mother-tongue: J OD , symbol of the vine-stock, or paternal sceptre of Noah; H E , type of the cup of libation s and also of maternity; V AU , which joins the two, and was depicted in India by the great and mysterious lingam. Such was the triple sign of the triad in the Divine Word; but the mother-letter appeared a second time, to express the fecundity of Nature and woman and to formulate the doctrine of universal and progressive analogies, d escending from causes to effects and ascending from effects to causes. Moreove r, the sacred word was not pronounced: it was spelt, and expressed in four wo rds, which are the four sacred words – J OD H E V AU H E . The learned Gaffarel regards the T ERAPHIM of the Hebrews, by means of which they consulted the oracles of the U RIM and T HUMMIM , as the figures of the four kabalistic animals, which symbols, as we shall show shortly, were epitomized by the sphinxes or cherubs of the ar k. In connexion with the usurped T ERAPHIM of"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE BOOK OF HERMES 129 Michas, he cites a curious passage from Ph ilo, which is a complete revelation as to the ancient and sacerdotal origin of our T AROTS . Gaffarel thus expresses himself: “He (Philo the Jew) speaking of the hi story concealed in the before-mentioned chapter of J UDGES , says that Michas made three “i mages of young boys and three young calves, three also of a lion, an e agle, a dragon and a dove, all of fine gold and silver; so that if anyone sought him to discover a secret concerning his wife, he interrogated the dove; concerning childre n, the young boy; concerning wealth, the eagle; concerning strength and powe r, the lion; concerning fecundity, the cherub or bull; concerning le ngth of days, the dragon.” This revelation of Philo, though deprecated by Gaffarel, is for us of the highest import ance. Here, in fact, is our key of the tetrad, and here also are the images of the four symbolical ani- mals found in the twenty-fi rst Key of the Tarot; that is, in the third septenary, thus repeating and summarizing all the symbolism expressed by the three septe- naries superposed; next, the antagonism of colours express ed by the dove and the dragon; the circle or R OTA , formed by the dragon or serpent to typify length of days; finally, the kabalistic divination of the entire Ta rot, as practised in later days by Egyptian Bohemians, whose secrets were divined and recovered imper- fectly by Etteilla. We see in the Bible that the high priest s consulted the Lord on the golden table of the holy ark between th e cherubim, or bull-headed and eagle-winged sphinx; that they consulted by the help of the T ERAPHIM , U RIM and T HUMMIM , and by the Ephod. Now, it is known that the Ephod was a magica l square of twelve numbers and twelve words engraved on precious stones. The word T ERAPHIM in Hebrew signifies hieroglyphs or figured signs; the U RIM and T HUMMIM were the above and beneath, the East and West, the yes and no, and these signs co rresponded to the two Pillars of the Temple, J AKIN and B OAZ . When therefore the high priest wished to consult the oracle, he drew by lot the T ERAPHIM or tablets of gold, which bore the images of the four sacred words, a nd placed them by threes round the rational or Ephod; that is, between the two onyx stones which serv ed as clasps to the little chains of the Ephod. The right onyx signified G EDULAH , or mercy and magnifi- cence; the left referred to G EBURAH , and signified justice an d anger. If, for exam- ple, the sign of the lion we re found on the left side of the stone which bore the name of the tribe of Judah, the high pri est would read the orac le thus: “The staff of the Lord is angered against Judah.” If the T ERAPHIM represented the man or cup and were found also on the left, near the stone of Benjamin, the high priest would read: “The mercy of the Lord is we ary of the offences of Benjamin, which outrage Him in His love. Therefore He wi ll pour out on him the chalice of his wrath,” etc. When the sovere ign priesthood ceased in Israel; when all oracles were silenced in the presen ce of the Word made man, and speaking by the mouth of the most popular and mildest of Sages; when the ark was lost, the sanctuary profaned and the temple destroye d; the mysteries of the E PHOD and T ERAPHIM , no longer"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"130 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic traced on gold and precious stones, were written, or rather drawn, by some learned Kabalists on ivory, parchment, gi lt and silvered copper, and, finally, on simple cards, which were al ways suspected by the offici al Church as enclosing a dangerous key to its mysteries. Hence ca me those Tarots, the antiquity of which, revealed to the erudite Court de Gebeli n by the science of hieroglyphs and num- bers, so exercised later the doubtful persp icacity and persistent investigation of Etteilla. Court de Gebelin, in the eighth volume of his Primeval World , gives sketches of the twenty-two Keys and fo ur aces of the Tarot, and demonstrates their perfect analogy with all symbols of the highest antiquity. He endeavours subsequently to supply th eir explanation and goes as tray naturally, because he does not start from th e universal and sacred T ETRAGRAM , the I O E VOHE of the Bacchanalia, the J OD H E V AU H E of the sanctuary, the xnxv of the Kabalah. Etteilla or Alliette, preocc upied entirely by his sy stem of divination and the material profit to be derived from it, Alliette, formerly barber, having never learned French or even orthography, pretended to reform and thus appropriate the Book of T HOTH . In the Tarot, now become very scarce, which he engraved, we find the following naive advertisement on the twenty-eighth ca rd – the eight of clubs: “Etteilla, professor of algebra and correctors (s ic) of the modern blunders of the ancient Book of Thoth, li ves in the Rue de l'Oseille, No 48 , Paris.” Etteilla would have certainly done better not to have corrected the blunders of which he speaks; his books have degr aded the ancient work disc overed by Court de Gebelin into the domain of vulgar Magic and fo rtune-telling by cards. He proves nothing who tries to prove too much. Etteilla furnishes another e xample of this old logical axiom. At the same time, his efforts led him to a certain acqu aintance with the Kabalah, as may be seen in some rare passages of his unreadable works. The true initiates who were Etteilla's contemporar ies, the Rosicrucians for example and the Martinists, were in possession of the true Tarot, as a wo rk of Saint-Martin proves, where the divisions are those of the Tarot, as also this quotati on from an enemy of the Rosicrucians: “They pretend to the possession of a volume from which they can learn anything discoverable in oth er books which exist now or may be pro- duced at any future period. This volume is their criterion, in which they find the prototype of everything that exists by the facility which it offers for analysing, making abstractions, forming a species of intellectual world and creating all pos- sible things. See the philosophical, th eosophical, micro-cosmic cards.” ( Conspir- acy Against the Catholic Religion and Sovereigns , by the author of The Veil Raised for the Curious . Paris: Crapard. 1792 .) The true initiates, we repeat, who held the secret of the Tarot among their greatest mysteries, refrained carefully from protesting against the errors of Etteilla and left him to reveil instead of reveal the arcana of the true Clavicles of Solomon.

He indicates as shown opposite the occult name of this key, which was known only to initiates.

Without the Tarot the Magic of the ancients is a closed book, and it is impossible to penetrate any of the great mysteries of the Kabalah.

It is a truly philosophical machine, which keeps the mind from wand ering, while leaving its initiative and liberty; it is mathematics applied to the Absolute, the alliance of the positive and the ideal, a lottery of thoughts as e xact as numbers, perhaps the simplest and grandest conception of human genius. The mode of reading the hieroglyphs of the Tarot is to arrange them in a square or triangle, placing equal numbers in antagonism and concili ating them by the unequal. Four signs express invariably th e absolute in a given order and are explained by a fifth. Hence th e solution of all magical questions is the Pentagram, and all antinomies are explained by harmo nious unity. So arranged, the Tarot is a veritable oracle and replies to all possibl e questions with more precision and infal- libility than the Android of Albertus Magnus. An imprisoned perso n with no other book than the Tarot, if he knew how to u se it, could in a few years acquire univer- sal knowledge, and would be ab le to speak on all subjec ts with unequalled learn- ing and inexhaustible eloque nce.

The old sanctuaries contain no further Mysteries, and the significance of the objects of the Hebrew cultus is comprehensible for the first time. Who does not perceive in the golden table, crow ned and supported by Cherubim which cov- ered the Ark of the Covenant , the same symbols as those of the twenty-first Tarot Key? The Ark was a hieroglyphical synthesi s of the whole kabalistic dogma; it included the J OD or blossoming staff of Aaron, the H E or cup, the gomor contain- ing the manna, the two tables of the law – an analogous symbol to that of the sword of justice – and the manna kept in the gomor, four objects which interpret wonderfully the letters of the Divine Tetragram. Gaff arel has proved learnedly that the Cherubim of the Ark were in th e likeness of bulls, but he did not know that instead of two there were four – two at each end, as the text expressly says – though it has been misconstrued for the most part by commentators. The eigh- teenth and nineteenth verse s of the twenty-fifth chap ter of Exodus should read thus: “And thou shalt make two calves or sphinxes of beaten gold on each side of the oracle. And thou shal t make the one looking th is way and the second that way.” The Cherubim or sphinxes were, in fact, coupled by twos on each side of the Ark, and their heads were turned to the four corners of the Mercy-Seat, which they covered with their wings inclined archwise, thus overshadowing the crown of the golden table, which they sustained upon their should ers, facing one another at the openings and looking at the Propitia tory, as shown in the figure above. The Ark, moreover, had three parts or stages, representing A TZILUTH , Y ETZIRAH and B RIAH – the three worlds of the Kabalah: th e base of the coffer, to which were fit- ted the four rings of two levers, analogous to the Pillars of the Temple, JAKIN and BOAZ; the body of the coffer, on which the sphinxes appeared in relief; and the cover, overshadowed by the wings. The base represented the kingdom of Salt, to use the terminology of the adepts of He rmes; the coffer, the realm of Mercury or A ZOTH ; and the cover, the realm of Sulphur or of fire. Th e other objects of the cul- tus were not less allegorical , but would require a specia l treatise to describe and explain them."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"140 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic Saint-Martin, in his N ATURAL T ABLE of the Correspondences between God, Man and the Universe, followed, as we have said, the division of the Tarot, giving an extended mystical commentary upon the twenty-two keys ; but he refrained carefully from stating when ce he derived his scheme and from revealing the hiero- glyphics on which he commented. Postel showed si milar discretion, naming the Tarot only in the diagram of his key to the arcana, and referring to it in the rest of his book under the title of the Genesis of Enoch. The personage Enoch, author of the primeval sacred book, is in effect identi cal with Thoth among the Egyptians, Cadmus among the Phoenicians and Pa lamedes among the Greeks. We have obtained in an extraordinary manner a si xteenth-century medal , which is a key of the Tarot. We are doubtful whether it should be confessed that this medal and the place where it was deposited were shown us in dream by the divine Paracelsus: in any case, the medal is in ou r possession. On one side it depicts the Juggler in a German costume of the sixt eenth century, holding his girdle in one hand and a Pentagram in the other. On a table in fr ont of him, between an open book and a closed purse, are ten deniers or talismans, arranged in tw o lines of three each and a square of four; the feet of the table form two h and those of the Juggler two inverted r . The obverse side of the medal cont ains the letters of the alphabet, arranged in a magica l square, as follows: It will be observed that this alphabet has only twenty-two letters, the V and N being duplicated, and that it is arranged in four quin aries, with a quaternary for base and key. The four final letters ar e two combinations of the duad and the triad, and read kabalistic ally they form the word A ZOTH by rendering to the shapes of the letters th eir value in primitive Hebrew, taking N for a , Z as it is in Latin, V for the Hebrew w Vau, which is pronounced O between two vowels, or let- ters having the value of vowel s, and X for the primitive T AU , which had precisely the same figure. The entire Tarot is thus explained in this wonderful medal, which is worthy of Paracelsus, and we hold it at the disposal of the curious. The letters arranged by four times five are summed by the word tw Z a , analogous to those of hwhy and INRI, and containing all the Mysteries of the Kabalah. The Book of the Tarot, bein g of such high sci entific importance, it is desirable that it should not be altered further.

We shall perhaps undertake the task. Vestiges of the Tarot are found among all nations. As we have said, the Italian is possibly the most faithf ul and best preserved, but it may be perfected further by precious indications derive d from Spanish varieties. Th e two of cups, for example, the Naïbi is completely Egyptian, show ing two archaic vases, with ibis handles, superposed on a cow. A unicorn is repres ented in the middle of the four of deniers; the three of cups exhibits the figure of Isis emerging from a vase, while two ibises issue from two other vases, one with a crown for the goddess and one holding a lotus, which he seems to be offering for her acceptan ce. The four aces bear the image of the hieratic and sacred serpent, while in some spec imens the Seal of Solomon is placed at the centre of the fo ur of deniers , instead of the symbolical unicorn. The German Tarots have suffered great alteration, and scarcely do more than preserve the numbers of the keys, which are crowde d with grotesque or pan- tagruelian figures. We have a Chinese Ta rot before us, and the Imperial Library contains samples of others that are simila r. M. Paul Boiteau, in his remarkable work on playing-cards, has given some admirably executed specimens. The Chi- nese Tarot preserves several primeval emble ms; the deniers and swords are plainly distinguishable, but it would be less easy to di scover the cups and clubs. It was at the epoch of th e Gnostic and Manichaean he resies that the Tarot must have been lost to the Church, at which time also the meaning of the divine Apoca- lypse perished. It was understood no longer that the seven seals of this kabalistic book are seven pantacles, the representatio n of which we give (facing this page), and that these pantacles are explained by the analogies of the numbers, charac- ters and figures of the Tarot. Thus the uni versal tradition of the one religion was broken for a moment, darkness or doubt spread over the whole earth, and it seemed in the eyes of ignorance, that true catholicism, the un iversal revelation, had disappeared for a space. The explanatio n of the book of St. John by the char- acters of the Kabalah will be an entirel y new revelation, thou gh foreseen by sev- eral distinguished Magi, one among whom, M. Augustin Chaho, thus expresses himself: “The poem of the Apocalypse pres upposes in the young evangelist a com- plete system and traditions individually developed by himsel f.

The description of the cataclysm and its duration; the new world emerging from the waves and spreadin g in all its beauty under heaven; the great serpent, bound for a time by an angel in the depths of the abyss; finally, the dawn of that age to come, prophesied by the Word, Who appeared to the apostle at the beginni ng of the poem: ‘H is head and his hairs were white like woo l, as white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his righ t hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.’ Such is Ormuz, Osiris, Chourien, the Lamb, the Christ, the Anci ent of Days, the Man of the time and the river celebrated by Daniel. He is the first and the last, Who was, Who must be, A LPHA and O MEGA , beginning and end. He hold s the key of mysteries in His hands; He opens the great abyss of ce ntral fire, where death sleeps beneath the canopy of darkness, where sleep s the great serpent awaiting the waken- ing of the ages.” The author connects this sublime allegor y of St. John with that of Daniel, wherein the four forms of the sphinx are applied to the chief periods of history, where the Man-Sun, the Word-Light, consoles and in structs the seer. “The prophet Daniel beholds a sea tos sed by the four winds of heaven, and beasts differing one from another come out of the de pths of the ocean. The empire of all things on earth was given them for a time, two times, and the dividing of time. They were four who so came forth. The first beast, symbol of the solar race of seers, came from th e region of Africa , resembling a lion and having eagle's wings: the heart of a man was given it. The second beast, emblem of the northern conquerors, wh o reigned by iron during the second age, was like unto a bear; it had three ro ws of sharp teeth, images of three great conquering families, and they sa id unto it: Arise, devour much flesh. After the apparition of the fourth be ast, there were thro nes raised up, and the Ancient of Days, the Ch rist of seers, the Lamb of the first age, was man- ifested. His garment was of dazzling whiteness, his he ad radiant; his throne, whence came forth living flames, was borne upon burning wheels; a flame of swift fire shone in his co untenance; legions of angels or stars sparkled round him. The tribunal was held, the alle gorical books were opened. The new Christ came with the clouds of heaven and stood before th e Ancient of Days; there were given Him powe r, honour and a kingdom over all peoples, tribes and tongues. Then Daniel came near unto one of them th at stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. And it was answered him that the four beasts were four powers which should re ign successively over the earth.”"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"144 The Ritual of Tr anscendental Magic M. Chaho proceeds to explain a variety of images, striking ly analogous, which are found in almost all sacr ed books. His observations at this point are worthy of remark. “In every primitive logos, the parallel between physical correspondences and moral relations is established on the same basis. Each word carries its mate- rial and sensible definition, and this livi ng language is as perfect and true as it is simple and natural in man the cr eator. Let the seer express by the same word, slightly modified, the sun, day, light, truth, and applying the same epithet to a white sun and to a lamb, le t him say, Lamb or Christ, instead of sun, and sun instead of trut h, light, civilization, and there is no allegory, but there are true correspondences seized and expressed by inspiration. But when the children of night say in their incoherent and barbarous dialect, sun, day, light, truth, lamb, the wise correspondence so clearly expressed by the primitive logos becomes effaced and disappears, and, by simple transla- tion, the lamb and the sun become a llegorical beings, symbols. Remark, in effect, that the word alle gory itself signifies in Celt ic definition, change of discourse, translation. The observation just made applies exactly to all bar- barian cosmogonical language. Seers ma de use of the same inspired radical to express nourishment and instruction. Is not the science of truth the nour- ishment of the soul? Thus, the scroll of papyrus, or the book, eaten by the prophet Ezekiel; the littl e volume which the angel gave as food to the author of the Apocalypse; the fest ivities of the magical pa lace of Asgard, to which Gangler was invited by Har the Sublime; the miraculous multiplication of seven loaves narrated of the Nazarene by the Evangelists; the living bread which Jesus-Sun gave his disciples to ea t, saying, ‘This is my body’; and a host of similar stories, ar e a repetition of the same allegory; the life of souls who are sustained by truth – truth wh ich multiplies without ever diminish- ing but, on the contrary, increases in the measure that it nourishes. Exalted by a noble sentiment of nationa lity, dazzled by th e idea of immense revolution, let a revealer of hidden things come forward and seek to popu- larize the discoveries of science among gross and ignorant men, destitute of the most simple elementary notions; let him say, for example, that the earth revolves and that it is sh aped like an egg: what resource has the barbarian who hears him except to believe? Is it not plain that every proposition of this nature becomes for him a dogma from on high, an article of faith? And is not the veil of a wise al legory sufficient to make it a mythos? In the schools of seers the terrestrial globe was represented by an egg of pasteboard or painted wood, and when youn g children were asked, ‘What is this egg?’ they answered, ‘It is the earth.’ Those ol der children, the barbarians, hearing this, repeated, after the litt le children of the seers: ‘T he world is an egg.’ But"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE BOOK OF HERMES 145 they understood thereby the physical, material world, wh ile the seers meant the geographical, ideal, image-world, created by mind and the logos.

Choumountou, the philosopher of the Ezour-Veda, explains after the sa me manner to the fanatic Biache what must be understood by the golden egg of Brahma.” We must not despair altogeth er of a period which sti ll concerns itsel f with these serious and reasonable researches; we have therefore cited these pages of M. Chaho with great mental satisfaction an d profound sympathy. Here is no longer the negative and desolating cr iticism of Dupuis and Voln ey, but an effort towards one faith and one worship connecting all the fu ture with all the past; it is an apol- ogy for all great men accused falsely of supe rstition and idolatry; it, is, finally, the justification of God Himself , that Sun of intelligence s Who is never veiled for upright souls and pure hearts. “Great and pre-eminent is the seer, th e initiate, the elect of Nature and of supreme reason,” cries the author once more, in concluding what we have just cited. “His alone is that faculty of imitation which is the principle of his perfection, while its inspirations, swift as a lightning flash , direct creations and discoveries. His alone is a perfect Wo rd of rightness, propriety, flexibil- ity, wealth, creating harmony of th ought by physical reaction-of thought, whereof the perceptions, as yet indepe ndent of language, ever reflect Nature exactly reproduced in its impressions, well judged and well expressed in its correspondences. His alone are light, science, truth, because imagination, confined to its passive secondary part, never gove rns reason, the natural logic which results from the comparis on of ideas; which come into being, extend in the same proportion as his n eeds, and which the circle of his knowledge enlarges thus by degrees wi thout intermixture of false judge- ments and errors. His alone is a ligh t infinitely progr essive, because the rapid increase of populati on, after terrestrial ren ovations, establishes in a few centuries a new societ y in all the imaginable mo ral and political corre- spondences of its destiny. We might a dd, in fine, that his alone is absolute light. The man of our ti me is immutable in him self; he changes no more than Nature, in which he is rooted . The social conditions which surround him alone determine the degree of his perfection, of which the bounds are virtue, holiness of man and his happiness in the law. “ After such elucidations, will anyone as k the utility of th e occult sciences?

Once a man said to us, “Raise up the devil, and I will believe in you.” We answered, “Y ou ask too little; we will not make the the devil appear but rather vanish from the whole worl d: we will chase him from your dreams!” The devil is ignorance, darkness, chaotic thought, deformity. Awake, sleeper of the Middle Ages! See you not that it is day? See you not the light of God filling all Nature? Where no w will the destroyed prince of perdition dare to show himself? It remains for us to state our conclusi ons and to define th e end and import of this work in the religious and philosophica l order, and in the order of positive and material realizations. As regards the reli gious order, we have demonstrated that the practices of worshi p cannot be indifferent that the Magic of religions is in their Rites, that their moral force is in the tr iadic hierarchy and that the base, principle and synthesis of hierarchy is unity. We have demonstrat ed the universal unity and orthodoxy of dogma, vested successively in various allegorical veils, and we have followed the truth saved by Moses from profanation in E gypt, preserved in the Kabalah of the prophets, emancipated by the Christian school from the slavery of the Pharisees, attracting all the poetic and generous aspirations of Greek and Roman civilization, protesting against a new Pharisaism more corrupt than the first, with the great saints of the Middle Ages and the bo ld thinkers of the Renais- sance. We have exhib ited, I say, that truth which is always universal, always liv- ing, alone conciliating reas on and faith, science and ob edience-the truth of being demonstrated by being, of harmony proved by harmony, of reason manifested by reason. By revealing for the first time to the world the Mysteries of Magic we have not sought to revive practi ces entombed beneath the ruin s of ancient civilizations, but would say to humanity in this our own d ay that it is called also to make itself immortal and omnipotent by its works. Liberty does not offe r itself but must be seized, says a modern writ er: it is the same with sc ience, for which reason to divulge absolute truth is ne ver useful to the vulgar. But at an epoch when the sanctuary has been devastated and has fall en into ruins, beca use its key has been thrown into the ditch, to th e profit of no one, I have deemed it my duty to pick up that key, and I offer it to him who can take it: in his turn he will be doctor of nations and liberator of the world. Fables and leading-strings are needed, and will be needed always by children; but it is not necessary that those who hold the lead- ing-strings should be children also, le nding a ready ear to fables.

Our book is catholic, and if the revelations it contains are likel y to alarm the consci ence of the simple, we are consoled by the thought that they will not read it. We write for unpreju- diced men and have no wish to flatter irreligion any more than fanaticism. If there be anything essentially free and inviolable in the world, it is belief. By science and persuasion we must endeavour to lead bewrayed imaginations from the absurd, but it would be investing their errors with all the dignity and truth of the martyr to either threaten or constrain them. Faith is nothing but superstition and folly if it have not reason for its basis, and we cannot suppose that which we do no t know except by analogy drawn from the realm of knowledge. To defin e that which lies outside al l experience is presumptu- ous ignorance; to affirm positively that whic h we do not know is to lie. So is faith an aspiration and desire. Amen; I desire it to be so: such is the last word of all pro- fessions of faith. Faith, hope and charity are three such inseparable sisters that they may be taken one for another. Thus in religion universal and hierarchic orthodoxy, restoration of temples in al l their splendour; reestablishment of high ceremonial in its primitive pomp; hierarc hic instruction of symbols, mysteries, miracles; legends for children, light for grown men who will beware of scandaliz- ing little ones in the simplicity of their fa ith: this in religion is our whole Utopia, as it is also the desi re and need of humanity. Coming now to philosophy, our own is that of realis m and positivism. Being is by reason of that Being of Whom no one doubts. All exists for us by science. To know is to be. Science and its object beco me identified in the intellectual life of him who knows. To doubt is to be ignorant. Now, a thin g of which we are ignorant does not as yet exist for us. To live intell ectually is to learn. Being develops and amplifies by science. The first conquest of science, and th e first result of the exact sciences, is the sentiment of reason. The la ws of Nature are algebraic. Thus the sole reasonable faith is th e adhesion of the student to theorems, the entire essen- tial justice of which lies outside his knowledge, though its applications and results are demonstrated adequately to his mind . So does the true philosopher believe in that which is and does not admit a posteriori that all is reasonable. But no more charlatanism in philosophy, no more empi ricism, no more system! The study of being and its compared realities! A metaphysic of Nature! Then away with mysti- cism! No more dreams in philosophy; philosophy is not poesy but pure mathemat- ics of realities, physical and moral.

Should that ideal lack basis, the whole edifice of his immortality collapses. Philosophy is not the ideal, but ought to serve as its foundation . The known is fo r us the measure of the unknown; by the visible we appreciate the invisible; se nsations are to thoughts even as thoughts to aspirations. Science is a celestial tri gonometry: one side of the absolute triangle is that Nature which is submitted to our investigations; the second is our soul, which embraces and reflects Nature; the third is the Absolute, in which our soul is magnified. No more atheism possible he nceforward, for we pretend no longer to define God. God is for us the most perfect and best of intelligent beings, and the ascending hierarchy of beings demonstr ates His existence amply.' Do not let us ask for more; but, to understand Him ever better, let us grow perfect by ascending towards Him. No more ideology; being is being, and cannot perfectionize save according to real laws of being. Observ e, and do not prejudge; exercise our facul- ties, do not falsify them; enlarge the domain of life in life; behold truth in truth! Everything is possible to him who wills only what is true! Rest in Nature, study, know, then dare; dare to will, dare to ac t and be silent! No more hatred of anyone. Everyone reaps what he sows. The conseque nce of works is fatal: to judge and chastise the wicked is for the Supreme Reason. He who enters into a blind alley must retrace his steps or be broken. Warn him gently, if he can still hear you, but human liberty must takes its course. We are not the judges of one another. Life is a battlefield. Do not pause in the warfar e on account of thos e who fall, but avoid trampling them. Then comes the victory, and the wounded on both sides, now brothers in suffering and before humanity, will meet in the ambulances of the conquerors. Such are the consequences of the philosophical dogm a of Hermes; such has been from all time the ethic of true adepts ; such is the philosophy of the Rosicru- cian inheritors of all the ancient wisdoms; such is the Secret Doctrine of those associations that are treated as subversive of the public order, and have ever been accused of conspiring agains t thrones and altars. The tr ue adept, far from dis- turbing the public order, is its firmest suppo rter. He has too great a respect for lib- erty to desire anarchy: child of the light, he loves harmony and knows that darkness begets confusion. He accepts ev erything that is a nd denies only what is not. He wills true religion, practical, universal, full of faith, palpable, realized in all life; he wills it to h ave a wise and powerful priest hood, surrounded by all the virtues and all the prestige of faith. He wills the univ ersal orthodoxy, the absolute, hierarchic, apostolic, sacramental, incont estable and uncontested catholicity. He wills an experimental philosophy, real, ma thematical, modest in its conclusions, untiring in its researches, sci entific in its progress. Who, therefore, can be against us if God and reason are with us? Does it matter if man prejudge and slander us? Our entire justification is in our thoughts and our works.

In the positive and material order, what must be co ncluded from this work? Is Magic a force which science may abandon to the boldest and wickedest? Is it a cheat and falsehood invented by rogues to cozen the ignorant and feeble? Is Philo- sophical Mercury the exploitation of cr edulity by address? Those who understand us know already how to answ er these questions. In these days, Magic can be no longer the art of fascinations and illusions: those only who wish to be deceived can be deceived now. But the narrow and rash incredulity of the la st century is denied in totality by Nature hersel f. We are environed by pr ophecies and miracles; unbe- lief once denied them unwisely; now, sc ience explains them. No, M. le Comte de Mirville, a lost spirit is not allowed to disturb the empire of God! No, things unknown cannot be explained by things im possible! No, invisi ble beings are not permitted to deceive, torment, seduce and even kill the living creatures of God, poor human beings, so ignora nt, as it is, so weak, scar ce able to combat their own delusions! Those who told you all this in your childhood, M. le Comte, have deceived you, and if you were child enough once to listen, be man enough now to disbelieve. Man is himself the creator of his heaven and hell, and there are no demons except our own follies. Minds ch astised by truth are corrected by that chastisement, and dream no more of disturbi ng the world. If Satan exist, he can be only the most unfortunate, most igno rant, most humiliated and most impotent of beings. The existence of a universal agent of life, a living fir e, an Astral Light, is demonstrated by facts. Magnetism enables us to understand today the miracles of old Magic; the facts of second sight, aspirations, sudden cures, thought-read- ing, are now admitted and familiar things , even for our children. But the tradition of the ancients has been lo st; discoveries have been rega rded as new; the last word is sought on observed phenomena; mi nds are agitated over meaningless manifes- tations; fascinations are ex perienced without being unde rstood. We say, therefore, to table-turners: These prodigies are no t novel; you can perform even greater wonders if you study the laws of Nature. And what will follow a new acquaintance with these powers?
