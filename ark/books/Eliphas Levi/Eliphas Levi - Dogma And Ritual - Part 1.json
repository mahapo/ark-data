Occult phi losophy seems to have been th e nurse or god-mother of all intellectual forces, the key of all divine obscu rities and the absolute queen of soci- ety in those ages – when it was reserved exclusively for the education of priests and of kings. It reigned in Persia with the Magi, who peri shed in the end, as perish all masters of the world, because they a bused their power; it endowed India with the most wonderful traditions and with an incredible wealth of poesy, grace and terror in its emblems; it civilized Greece to the mu sic of the lyre of Orpheus; it concealed the principles of all sciences, all progress of the human mind, in the daring calculations of Pythagoras; fabl e abounded in its miracles, and history, attempting to estimate this unknown power, became confused with fable; it undermined or consolidated empires by its oracles, cau sed tyrants to tremble on their thrones and governed all minds, either by curiosity or by fear. For this sci- ence, said the crowd, there is nothing impossible, it commands the elements, knows the language of the stars and direct s the planetary course s; when it speaks, the moon falls blood-red from heaven; the dead rise in their graves and mutter ominous words, as the night wind blows thro ugh their skulls. Mistress of love or of hate, occult science can disp ense paradise or he ll at its pleasure to human hearts; it disposes of all forms and confers beauty or ugliness; with the wand of Circe it changes men into brut es and animals alternately into men; it disposes even of life and death, can confer weal th on its adepts by the transmutation of metals and immortality by its quintessence or el ixir, compounded of gold and light. Such was Magic from Zoroaster to Mane s, from Orpheus to Apollonius of Tyana, when positive Christ ianity, victorious at leng th over the brilliant dreams and titanic aspirations of the Alexandrian school, dare d to launch its anathemas publicly against this philosophy, and thus forced it to become more occult and mysterious than ever. Moreover, strange and alarming rumours began to circulate concerning initiates or adepts; they were surrounded every where by an ominous influence, and they destr oyed or distracted those wh o allowed themselves to be beguiled by their honeyed eloquence or by the sorcery of their learning. The women whom they loved beca me Stryges and their childr en vanished at nocturnal meetings, while men whispered shudderingly and in secret of bloodstained orgies"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"2 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic and abominable banquets. Bone s had been found in the cr ypts of ancient temples, shrieks had been heard in the night, ha rvests withered and herds sickened when the magician passed by. Di seases which defied medical skill appeared at times in the world, and always, it was said, beneath the enveno med glance of the adepts. At length a universal cry of execrati on went up against Magic, the mere name became a crime and the common hatred wa s formulated in this sentence: “Magi- cians to the flames!” – as it was shouted some centuries earlier: “To the lions with the Christians!” Now the mu ltitude never conspires exce pt against real powers; it does not know what is true, but it has the instinct of what is strong. It remained for the eighteenth century to deride both Christians and Magic, while infatuated with the disquisitions of Rousseau and the il lusions of Cagliostro. Science, notwithstanding, is at the basis of Magic, as at the root of Christianity there is love, and in the Gospel symbols we find the Word Inca rnate adored in His cradle by Three Magi, led th ither by a star – the triad and the sign of the micro- cosm – and receiving their gifts of gol d, frankincense and myrrh, a second myste- rious triplicity, under wh ich emblem the highest secrets of the Kabalah are allegorically contained. Ch ristianity owes therefore no hatred to Magic, but human ignorance has ever stood in fear of the unknown. The science was driven into hiding to escape the impassioned assaul ts of blind desire: it clothed itself with new hieroglyphics, falsified its intentions, denied its hopes. Then it was that the jargon of alchemy was create d, an impenetrable illusion for the vulgar in their greed of gold, a living language on ly for the true disciple of Hermes. Extraordinary fact! Among the sacred r ecords of the Christians there are two texts which the infallible Church mak es no claim to unde rstand and has never attempted to expound: these are the Proph ecy of Ezekiel and the Apocalypse, two Kabalistic Keys reserved assuredly in heaven for the commentaries of Magian Kings, books sealed as with seven seals for faithful believers, yet perfectly plain to an initiated infidel of the occult sci ences. There is also another work, but, although it is popular in a sense and may be found everywhere, this is of all most occult and unknown, because it is the key of the rest. It is in public evidence with- out being known to the publi c; no one suspects its ex istence and no one dreams of seeking it where it actually is. This book , which may be older than that of Enoch, actually has never been tran slated, but is still preserv ed unmutilated in primeval characters, on detached le aves, like the tablets of the ancients. The fact has eluded notice, though a dist inguished scholar has reveal ed, not indeed its secret, but its antiquity and singular preservatio n. Another scholar, but of a mind more fantastic than judicious, passed years in the study of this masterpiece, and has merely suspected its plenary importance .

It is to be counted unquestionably among the very great gifts bequeathed to us by antiquity; it is a universal key, the name of which has been explained and comprehended only by the learned Will- iam Postel; it is a unique test, whereof th e initial characters alone plunged into ecstasy the devout spirit of Saint-Martin, and might have restored reason to the sublime and unfortunate Swedenborg. We shal l recur to this book later on, for its mathematical and precise explanation will be the complement and crown of our conscientious undertaking. The original alliance betw een Christianity and the Science of the Magi, once demonstrated fully, will be a discovery of no second-rate importance, and we do not doubt that the serious st udy of Magic and the Kabalah will lead earnest minds to a reconciliation of science and dogma, of reason and faith, heretofore regarded as impossible. We have said that the Church, whose spec ial office is the custody of the Keys, does not pretend to possess th ose of the Apocalypse or of Ezekiel. In the opinion of Christians the scientific and magical Clavi cles of Solomon are lost, which notwith- standing, it is certain that, in the domain of intelligen ce, ruled by the Word noth- ing that has been written can perish. Whatsoever me n cease to understand exists for them no longer, at least in the order of the Word, and it passes then into the domain of enigma and mystery. Furtherm ore, the antipathy and even open war of the Official Chur ch against all that belo ngs to the realm of M agic, which is a kind of personal and emancipated priesthood, is allied with nece ssary and even with inherent causes in the social and hierarc hic constitution of Christian sacerdotal- ism. The Church ignores Magic – for she mu st either ignore it or perish, as we shall prove later on; yet she does not recognize the less that her mysterious Founder was saluted in His cradle by Three Magi – that is to say, by the hieratic ambassadors of the three parts of th e known world and the three analogical worlds of occult philosophy. In the Sch ool of Alexandria, Magic and Christianity almost joined hands under th e auspices of Ammonius Sa ccas and of Plato; the doctrine of Hermes is found almost in its entirety in the writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite; Synesius outli ned the plan of a treatise on dreams, which was annotated subsequently by Ca rdan, and composed hymns that might have served for the liturgy of the Church of Swedenborg, could a church of the illuminated possess a liturgy. With this period of fiery abst ractions and impas- sioned warfare of words there must be connected also the philosophic reign of Julian, called the Apostate because in his youth he made unwilling profession of Christianity. Everyone is aware that Julian had the misfortune to be a hero out of season of Plutarch, and that he was, if one may say so, the Don Quixote of roman Chivalry; but what most people do not kn ow is that he was one of the illuminated and an initiate of the first order: that he believed in the unit y of God and in the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic universal doctrine of the Trin ity; that, in a word, he re gretted nothing of the old world but its magnificent symb ols and its too gracious images. Julian was not a pagan; he was a Gnostic allured by the allegories of Greek polytheism, who had the misfortune to find th e name of Jesus Christ less sonorous than that of Orpheus. The Emperor paid in his person fo r the academical tastes of the philoso- pher and rhetorician, and after affording himself the spectacle and satisfaction of expiring like Epaminondas with the periods of Cato, he had in public opinion, by this time fully Christianized , but anathemas for his fune ral oration and a scornful epithet for his ultimate memorial. Let us pass over the petty minds and small matters of the Bas-Empire, and proceed to the Middle Ages . . . . Stay, take this book! Glance at the seventh page, then seat yourself on the mantle which I am spreadin g, and let each of us cover our eyes with one of its co rners . . . . Your head swim s, does it not, and the earth seems to fly beneath your feet? Hold tightly, and do not look right or left . . . . The vertigo ceases: we are here. Sta nd up and open your eyes, but take care before all things to make no Christian sign and to pronounce no Christian words. We are in a landscape of Salvator Rosa , a troubled wilderness which seems resting after a storm. There is no moon in the sky, but you can dist inguish little stars gleaming in the brushwood, and may hear about you the slow flight of great birds, which seem to whis per strange oracles as th ey pass. Let us approach silently that crossroad am ong the rocks. A harsh, f unereal trumpet winds sud- denly, and black torches flare up on ever y side. A tumultuous throng is surging round a vacant throne: all wa tch and wait. Suddenly they cast themselves on the ground. A goat-headed prin ce bounds forward amon g them; he ascends the throne, turns, and assuming a stooping po sture, presents to the assembly a human face, which everyone comes forward to sa lute and to kiss, their black taper in their hands. With a hoarse laugh he recovers an uprig ht position, and then dis- tributes gold, secret instructions, occu lt medicines and poisons to his faithful bondsmen. Meanwhile, fires are lighted of fern and alder, piled up with human bones and the fat of executed criminals . Druidesses, crowne d with wild parsley and vervain, immolate unbaptized childr en with golden knives and prepare horri- ble love-feasts. Tables are spread, ma sked men seat the mselves by half-nude females, and a Bacchanalian orgy begins; there is nothing wanting but salt, the symbol of wisdom and immo rtality. Wine flows in streams, leaving stains like blood; obscene advances and abandoned ca resses begin. A litt le while, and the whole assembly is beside it self with drink and wantonne ss, with crimes and sing- ing. They rise, a disordered throng, and form infernal dances . . . . Then come all legendary monsters, all phantoms of ni ghtmare; enormous toads play inverted flutes and thump with paws on flanks; limping scarabaei mingle in the dance; crabs play the castanets; cr ocodiles beat time on their scales; elephants and mam- moths appear habited like Cupids and foot it in the ring: finally, the giddy circles"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 5 break up and scatter on all si des . . . . Every yelling dancer drags away a dishev- elled female . . . . Lamps and candles formed of human fat go out smoking in the darkness . . . . Cries are heard here and there, mingled with peals of laughter, blasphemies and rattlings in the throat . Come, rouse yourself: do not make the sign of the cross! See, I have brought you home. You are in your bed, not a little worn out, possibly a trifle shattered, by your night's journey a nd its orgy; but you have beheld that of whic h everyone talks without knowl edge; you have been initi- ated into secrets no less terrible than the grotto of Triphonius; you have been present at the Sabbath. It remains for you now to preserve your wits, to have a wholesome dread of the law, and to keep at a respectful dist ance from the Church and her faggots. Would you care, as a change, to behold something less fantastic, more real and also more truly terrible? You shall assist at the execution of Jacques de Molay and his accomplices or his brethren in martyr dom . . . . Be not misled, however; con- fuse not the guilty and the innocent! Did the Templars really adore Baphomet? Did they offer a shameful salutation to the buttocks of the goat of Mendes? What was actually this secret and potent as sociation which impe rilled Church and State, and was thus destroyed unheard? Judg e nothing lightly; they are guilty of a great crime; they have exposed to profane eyes the sanctuary of antique initiation. They have gathered again and have shared the fruits of the tr ee of knowledge, so that they might become mast ers of the world. The ju dgement pronounced against them is higher and far older than the tr ibunal of pope or king: “On the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely di e,” said God Himself, as we read in the Book of Genesis. What then is taking place in the wo rld, and why do pr iests and potentates tremble? What secret power threatens tiar as and crowns? A fe w bedlamites are roaming from land to land, concealing, as they say, the Philosophical Stone under their ragged vesture. They can change ea rth into gold, and they are without food or lodging! Their brows are encircled by an aureole of glory and by a shadow of ignominy! One has discovered the universal science and goes vain ly seeking death to escape the agonies of his triumph: he is the Majorcan Raymond Lully. Another heals imaginary diseases by fantastic remedies, bely ing beforehand that proverb which enforces the futility of a cautery on a wooden leg: he is the marvellous Paracelsus, always drunk and always lucid, like the heroes of Rabelais. Here is William Postel writing naivel y to the fathers of the Council of Trent, proclaiming that he has discovered the absolute do ctrine, hidden from the foundation of the world, and is longing to share it with them. The Council heeds not the maniac, does not vouchsafe to cond emn him, but proceeds to e xamine the grave questions of efficacious grace and suff icing grace.

What secret do these men bear with them to their tomb? Why are they wondered at without being understood? Why are they con- demned unheard? Why are they initiates of those terrific secret sciences of which the Church and society are afraid? Why ar e they acquainted with things of which others know nothing? Why do they conceal what all men burn to know? Why are they invested with a dread and unkno wn power? The occult sciences! Magic! These words will reveal all and give food for further thought! De omni re scribili et quibusdum aliis . But what, as a fact, was this Magic? What was the power of these men who were at once so proud and so persecuted? If they were really strong, why did they not overcome their enemies? But if they were impotent and foolish, why did peo- ple honour them by fearing them? Does M agic exist? Is there an occult knowledge which is in truth a power and works wo nders comparable to the miracles of authorized religions? To these two palm ary questions we ma ke answer by an affirmation and a book. The book shall ju stify the affirmation, and the affirma- tion is this: There was and there still is a potent and real Magic; all that is said of it in legend is true after a certain mann er, yet – contrary to the common course of popular exaggeration – it falls below th e truth. There is indeed a formidable secret, the revelation of wh ich has once already transfo rmed the world, as testified in Egyptian religious trad ition, summarized symbolically by Moses at the begin- ning of Genesis. This secret constitutes the fatal Science of Good and Evil, and the consequence of its revelation is death. Moses depicts it under th e figure of a Tree which stands in the midst of the Terrestrial Paradise, is in proximity to the Tree of Life and is joined at the root thereto. At the foot of this tree is the source of the four mysterious rivers; it is guarded by th e sword of fire and by the four symboli- cal forms of the Biblical sphinx, the Cherub im of Ezekiel . . . . Here I must pause, and I fear that already I have said too much . I testify in fine that there is one sole, universal and imperishable dogma, strong as supreme reason; simple, like all that is great; intelligible, like all that is universally and ab solutely true; and this dogma is the parent of all others. There is also a science which confers on man powers apparently superhuman. They are enu merated thus in a Hebrew manuscript of the sixteenth century: “Hereinafter follow the po wers and privileges of him who holds in his right hand the Clavicles of Solomon, a nd in his left the Branch of the Blos- soming Almond. ' A LEPH . – He beholds God face to face, without dying. and converses familiarly with the seven genii who command the entire celes- tial army. h B ETH . – He is above all gr iefs and all fears. g G HIMEL . – He reigns with all heaven and is served by all hell. o D ALETH . – He rules his own health and life and can influ ence equally those of others. x H E . – He can neither be surprised by misfortune nor overwhelmed by disasters, nor"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 7 can he be conquered by his enemies. n V AU . – He knows the reason of the past, present and future. z Z AIN . – He possesses the secre t of the resurrection of the dead and the key of immortality. Such are the seven chief privileges, and those which rank next are these: k C HETH . – To find the Philosophical Stone. t T ETH . – To possess the Universal Medicine. v I OD . – To know the laws of perpetual motion and to prove the quadrature of the circle. [ C APH . – To change into gold not only all metals but also the earth itself, and even the refuse of the earth. s L AMED . – To subdue the most ferocious animals and have power to pro- nounce those words which para lyse and charm serpents. a M EM . – To have the A RS N OTORIA which gives the Universal Science. i N UN . – To speak learnedly on all subj ects, without preparat ion and without study. These, finally, are the seven least powers of the Magus: y S AMECH . – To know at a glance the deep things of the souls of men and the mysteries of the hearts of women. r A YIN . – To force Nature to make him free at his pleasure. q P E . – To foresee all future events which do not depend on a superior free will, or on an undiscernible cause. , T SADE . – To give at once and to all the most efficacious consolations and the most wholesome counsels. f K OPH . – To triumph over adversities. w R ESH . – To conquer love and hate. c S HIN . – To have the secret of wealth, to be always its master and never its slave. To enjoy even poverty and never become abject or miserable. m T AU . – Let us add to these three septe naries that the wise man rules the elements, stills tempests, cures the diseased by his touch and raises the dead! But certain things have been sealed by Solomon with his triple seal. It is enough that the initiates know; as for others, whet her they deride, doubt or believe, whether they thre aten or fear, what matte rs it to science or to us?” Such actually are the issues of occult philosophy, and we are in a position to meet the charge of insani ty or the suspicion of im posture when we affirm that these privileges are re al. To demonstrate this is the sole end of our work on occult philosophy. The Philosophical Stone, th e Universal Medicine, the transmutation of metals, the quadrature of the circle a nd the secret of perpetual motion are nei- ther mystifications of sc ience nor dreams of delusion . They are terms which must be understood in their proper sense; they formulate the varied applications of one and the same secret, the several aspects of a single operation, which is defined in a more comprehensive manner under the name of the Great Work. Furthermore, there exists in Nature a force which is immeasurably more powerful than steam, and a single man, who is able to adapt and direct it, might change thereby the face of the whole world. This force was known to the anci ents; it consists in a Uni- versal Agent having equilibrium for its supreme law, while its direction is con-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"8 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic cerned immediately with the Great Arca num of Transcendental Magic. By the direction of this agent it is possible to modify the very order of the seasons; to pro- duce at night the phenomena of day; to correspond instantaneously between one extremity of the earth and th e other; to see, like Apollo nius, what is taking place on the other side of th e world; to heal or injure at a distance; to give speech a uni- versal success and reverber ation. This agent, which barely manifests under the uncertain methods of Mesmer's followers, is precisely that which the adepts of the Middle Ages denominated the First Matter of the Great Work. The Gnostics repre- sented it as the fiery body of the Holy Sp irit; it was the object of adoration in the Secret Rites of the Sabbath and the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Bap- homet or the Androgyne of Mend es. All this will be proved. Here then are the secrets of occult philosophy, and such is Magic in history. Let us glance at it now as it appears in its books and its acts, in its Initiations and its Rites. The key of all magica l allegories is found in the tablets which we have men- tioned, and these tablets we regard as the work of Hermes. About this book, which may be called the keystone of th e whole edifice of oc cult science, are grouped innumerable legends th at are either its partial translation or its commen- tary reproduced perpetually, under a th ousand varied forms. Sometimes the inge- nious fables combine harmoniously into a great epic which characterizes an epoch, though how or why is not clear to the uninitiated. T hus, the fabulous his- tory of the Golden Fleece resumes and also veils the Hermet ic and magical doc- trines of Orpheus; and if we recur only to the mysteri ous poetry of Greece, it is because the sanctuaries of Egypt and Indi a to some extent dismay us by their resources, leaving our choi ce embarrassed in the mids t of such abundant wealth. We are eager, moreover, to reach the Thebaid at once, that dread synthesis of all doctrine, past, present and future; that – so to speak – infinite fable, which reaches, like the Deity of Orpheus, to either end of the cycle of human life. Extraordinary fact! The seven gates of Th ebes, attacked and defended by seven chiefs who have sworn upon the blood of victims, poss ess the same significance as the seven seals of the Sacred Book interp reted by seven genii and assailed by a monster with seven heads, after being op ened by a Lamb which liveth and was dead, in the allegorical work of St. John. The mysterious origin of Oedipus, found hanging on the tree of Cith aeron like a bleeding fruit, recalls the symbols of Moses and the narratives of Genesis. He makes war upon his father, wh om he slays with- out knowing – tremendous prophecy of th e blind emancipation of reason apart from science. Thereafter he meets with the sphinx, that symbol of symbols, the eternal enigma of the vulgar, the granite pe destal of the sciences of the sages, the voracious and silent mons ter whose unchanging form expresses the one dogma of the Great Universal Mystery. How is th e tetrad changed into the duad and explained by the triad? In more common but more emblematic terms, what is that animal which in the morning has four feet , two at noon, and three in the evening?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 9 Philosophically speaking, how does the doct rine of elementary forces produce the dualism of Zoroaster, while it is summa rized by the triad of Pythagoras and Plato? What is the ultimate reason of allegories and numbers, the final message of all symbolisms? Oedipus repl ies with a simple and t errible word which destroys the sphinx and makes the di viner King of Th ebes: the answer to the enigma is M AN ! . . . Unfortunate! He has seen too much , and yet through a clouded glass. A little while and he will expiate his ominous and imperfect clairvoyance by a vol- untary blindness, and then van ish in the midst of a storm, like all civilizations which – each in its own day – shall divine an answer to the riddle of the sphinx without grasping its whole import and mystery. Everything is symbolical and transcendental in this titanic epic of hu man destinies. The two antagonistic broth- ers formulate the second part of the Grand Mystery, completed divinely by the sacrifice of Antigone. Ther e follows the last war; th e brethren slay one another; Capaneus is destroyed by the lightning wh ich he defies; Amphia raus is swallowed by the earth; and all these are so many allegories which, by their truth and their grandeur, astonish those wh o can penetrate their triple hieratic sense. Aeschylus, annotated by Ballanche, gives only a we ak notion concerning them, whatever the primeval sublimities of the Greek poet or the ingenuities of the French critic. The secret book of antique initiation was not unknown to Homer, who outlines its plan and chief figures on the shield of Ac hilles, with minute precision. But the gracious Homeric fictions replaced too soon in popu lar memory the simple and abstract truths of prime val revelation. Humanity cl ung to the form and allowed the idea to be forgotten; signs lost po wer in their multipli cation; Magic became corrupted also at this period, and degene rated with the sorcerers of Thessaly into the most profane enchantments. The crim e of Oedipus brought forth its deadly fruits, and the science of good and evil erect ed evil into a sacrilegious divinity. Men, weary of the light, took refuge in the shadow of bodily substance; the dream of that void which is fille d by God seemed in their ey es to be greater than God Himself, and thus hell was created. When, in the course of this work, we make use of the consecrated terms God, Heaven and Hell, let it be understood, once and for all, that our meaning is as far removed from that which the profane attach to them as initiation is remote from vulgar thought. God, for us, is the A ZOT of the sages, the ef ficient and final prin- ciple of the Great Work. Returning to the fable of Oe dipus, the crime of the Ki ng of Thebes was that he failed to understand the sphinx; that he destroyed the scourge of Thebes without being pure enough to complete the expi ation in the name of his people. The plague, in consequence, ave nged speedily the death of the monster, and the King of Thebes, forced to abdicate, sacrificed himself to the terrible manes of the sphinx, more alive and voracious than ever when it had passed from the domain of form into that of idea . Oedipus divined what was man and he put out his own"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic eyes because he did not see what was God. He divulged half of the Great Arcanum, and, to save his pe ople, it was necessary for him to bear the remaining half of the terrible secret into exile and the grave. After the colossal fable of Oedipus we find the gracious poem of Psyche, which was certainly not invented by Apuleius . The Great Magical Arcanum reappears here under the figure of a mysterious uni on between a god an d a weak mortal, abandoned alone and naked on a rock. Psyc he must remain in ignorance of the secret of her id eal royalty, and if she behold h er husband she must lose him. Here Apuleius commentates and inte rprets Moses; but did not the Elohim of Israel and the gods of Apuleius both issue from the sanctu aries of Memphis and Thebes? Psyche is the sister of Eve, or rather she is Eve spiritua lized. Both desire to know and lose innocence for the honour of the ordeal. Both deserve to go down into hell, one to bring back the anti que box of Pandora, the oth er to find and to crush the head of the old serpent, who is the symbol of time and of evil. Both are guilty of the crime which must be expiated by th e Prometheus of ancient days and the Lucifer of the Christian le gend, the one delivered by Hercules and the other over- come by the Saviour. The Great Magical Secret is therefore the lamp and dagger of Psyche, the apple of Eve, the sacred fire of Prometheus, the burning sceptre of Lucifer, but it is also the Holy Cross of the Redeemer. To be acquainted with it sufficiently for its abuse or divulgation is to deserve all suffering s; to know as one should alone know it, namely, to make use of and conceal it, is to be master of the Absolute. A single word comprehends all things, and this word consists of four letters: it is the Tetragram of the Hebrews, the A ZOT of the alchemists , the Thot of the Bohemians, or the Taro of the Kabalists. This word, expressed after so many man- ners, means God for the profane, man fo r the philosophers, and imparts to the adepts the final term of hu man sciences and the key of divine power; but he only can use it who understands the necessity of never re vealing it. Had Oedipus, instead of killing the sphi nx, overcome it, harnessed it to his chariot and thus entered Thebes, he would have been king without incest, with out misfortunes and without exile. Had Psyche, by meekness and affection, persuaded Love to reveal himself, she would never h ave lost Love. Now, Love is one of the mythological images of the Great Secret and the Great Agent, because it postulates at once an action and a passion, a void and a plen itude, a shaft and a wound. The initiates will understand me, and on account of the profane I mu st not speak more clearly. After the marvellous Golden Ass of Apul eius, we find no more magical epics. Science, conquered in Alexandria by th e fanaticism of the murderers of Hypatia, became Christian, or rather concealed it self under Christian ve ils with Ammonius, Synesius and the pseudonymo us author of the books of Dionysius the Areopagite. In such times it was necessa ry to exonerate miracles under the pretence of super- stition and science by an unintelligible language. Hieroglyphic writing was"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 11 revived; pantacles and characters were in vented to summarize an entire doctrine by a sign, a whole sequence of tendencies and revelations in a word. What was the end of the aspirants to knowl edge? They sought the secr et of the Great Work, the Philosophical Stone, the perpetual motion, the quadrature of the circle, the Uni- versal Medicine – formula e which often saved them fr om persecution and hatred by causing them to be taxed with madness, but all signifying one of the phases of the Great Magical Secret, as we shall show later on. This absence of epics contin- ues till our Romance of the Rose; but the rose-symbol, which expresses also the mysterious and magical sense of Dante's poem, is borrowed fr om the transcendent Kabalah, and it is time th at we should have recou rse to this vast and hidden source of universal philosophy. The Bible, with all its allegories, gives expression to the religious knowledge of the Hebrews only in an incomplete and veiled manner. The book which we have mentioned, the hieratic ch aracters of which we shall explain subsequently, that book which William Postel names the Ge nesis of Enoch, existed certainly before Moses and the prophets, whose doctrine, fundamentally iden tical with that of the ancient Egyptians, had also its exotericism and its veil s. When Moses spoke to the people, says the sacred book allegorically , he placed a veil over his face, and he removed it when communing with God: this accounts for th e alleged Biblical absurdities which so exercised the sati rical powers of Voltaire. The books were written only as memorials of tradition a nd in symbols that we re unintelligible to the profane. The Pentateuch and the poems of the prophets were, moreover, ele- mentary works, alike in do ctrine, ethics and liturgy; the true secret and tradi- tional philosophy was not committed to writing until a la ter period and under veils even less transparent. Thus arose a second and unknown Bible, or rather one which was not comprehended by Christians , a storehouse, so they say, of mon- strous absurdities – for in this case believers, involved by the same ignorance, speak the language of sceptics – but a mo nument, as we affirm, which comprises all that philosophical and re ligious genius has ever a ccomplished or imagined in the sublime order, a treasure encompassed by thorns, a diamond concealed in a rude and opaque stone: our readers will have guessed already that we refer to the Talmud. How strange is the destiny of the Jews, those scape goats, martyrs and saviours of the world, a people full of vi tality, a bold and hardy race, which perse- cutions have preserved intact , because it has not yet a ccomplished its mission! Do not our apostolical traditions declare that after the decline of faith among the Gentiles salvation shall again come forth out of the hous e of Jacob, and that then the crucified Jew Who is adored by the Ch ristians will give the empire of the world into the hands of God His Father? On penetrating into the sanctuary of th e Kabalah one is seized with admiration in the presence of a do ctrine so logical, so simple and at the same time so abso- lute.

Such also are the component principles of the written Word, reflection of that spoken Word wh ich created the world! All truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return therein. What- soever is grand or scientific in the reli gious dreams of the illuminated, of Jacob Bohme, Swedenborg, Saint-Martin and the r est, is borrowed from the Kabalah; all Masonic associations owe to it their secrets and their symbols. The Kabalah alone consecrates the alliance of uni versal reason and the Divi ne Word; it establishes by the counterpoise of two forces in appare nt opposition, the eternal balance of being; it alone reconciles reason with faith, power wi th liberty, science with mys- tery: it has the keys of th e present, past and future! To become initiated into the Kabalah it is insufficient to read and to meditate upon the writings of Reuchlin, Galatinus, Kircher, or Picus de Mirandola; it is necessary to study and underst and the Hebrew writers in the collection of Pisto- rius, the Sepher Yetzirah above all; it is essential in particular to master the great book Zohar, to investigate the collection of 1684 , entitled Kabbala Denudata , especially the treatise on “Kabalistic Pneumatics” and that on the “Revolution of Souls”; and afterwards to enter boldly in to the luminous darkness of the whole dogmatic and allegorical body of the Talm ud. We shall be then in a position to understand William Postel, and shall admi t secretly that – apart from his very premature and overgenerous dreams about the emancipation of women – this cel- ebrated, learned, il luminated man could not have b een so mad as is pretended by those who have not read him. We have sketched rapidly the history of occult philosophy; we have indicated its sources and analysed in a few words its chief memo rials. The present division of our work refers only to the science, but Magic, or rather magical power, com- prehends two things, a science and a forc e: without the force the science is noth- ing, or rather it is a da nger. To give knowledge to power alone, such is the supreme law of initiations. Hence did the Great Revealer say: `The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, a nd the violent only shall ca rry it away.' The door of truth is closed, like the sa nctuary of a virgin: he must be a man who would enter. All miracles are promised to faith, and wh at is faith except the audacity of will which does not hesitate in the darkness, but advances towards the light in spite of all ordeals, and surmounting all obstacle s? It is unnecessary to repeat here the history of ancient initiations: the more dangerous and terrible they were, the greater was their efficacy.

It was a noviti ate similar to that of those priests who, under the name of Jesuits, are so unpopula r at the present day, but would govern the world notwithstanding, had they a truly wise and intelligent chief. After passing our life in th e search for the Absolute in religion, science and jus- tice; after revolving in the circle of Faust, we have reached the primal doctrine and the first book of humanity. At this point we pause, having discovered the secret of human omnipotence and indefin ite progress, the ke y of all symbolisms, the first and final doctrine: we have co me to understand what was meant by that expression so often made use of in the Gospel – the Kingdom of God. To provide a fixed point as a fulcrum for human activity is to solve the problem of Archimedes, by realizing the use of his famous lever. This it is which was accomplished by the great initiators wh o have electrified the world, and they could not have done so except by mean s of the Great and Incommunicable Secret. However, as a guarantee of its renewed youth, the symbolical phoenix never reap- peared before the eyes of the world without having consumed solemnly the remains and evidences of its previous life. So also Moses saw to it that all those who had known Egypt and her mysteries sh ould end their life in the desert; at Ephesus St. Paul burnt all books which tr eated of the occult sciences; and in fine, the French Revolution, daughter of the great Johannite Orient and the ashes of the Templars, spoliated the churches and blasphemed the allegories of the Divine Cultus. But all doctrines and all revivals proscribe Magic and condemn its myster- ies to the flames and to oblivion. The reas on is that each religion or philosophy which comes into the world is a Benjamin of humanity a nd insures its own life by destroying its mother. It is because the symbolical serpent tu rns ever devouring its own tail; it is because, as essential condition of exis tence, a void is necessary to every plenitude, space for every dimensio n, an affirmation for each negation: herein is the eternal realiz ation of the phoenix allegory. Two illustrious scholars have preceded me along the path that I am travelling, but they have, so to speak, spent the dark night therei n. I refer to Volney and Dupuis, to Dupuis above all, whose immen se erudition produc ed only a negative work, for in the origin of all religions he saw nothing but astronomy, taking thus the symbolic cycle for doct rine and the calendar for le gend. He was deficient in one branch of knowledge, that of true Magic which comprises the secrets of the Kabalah. Dupuis passed through the antiqu e sanctuaries, like the prophet Ezekiel over the plain strewn with bones, and only understood death, for want of that word which collects the virt ue of the four winds and ca n make a living people of all the vast ossuary, by crying to the ancient symbols: ‘Arise! Take up a new form and walk!’ But the hour has come when we must have the courage to attempt what no one has dared to perform previously. Like Julian, we would rebuild the temple, and in so doing we do not believ e that we shall be belying a wisdom that we venerate, which also Julian would himse lf have been worthy to adore, had the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"14 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic rancorous and fanatical doctors of his period permitted him to understand it. For us the Temple has two Pillars, on one of which Christianity has inscribed its name. We have therefore no wish to attack Christianity : far from it, we seek to explain and accomplish it. Intelligence a nd will have exercised alternately their power in the world; religion and philosophy are still at war with one another, but they must end in agreement. The provisional object of Christianity was to estab- lish, by obedience and faith, a supernat ural or religious equality among men, to immobilize intelligence by fa ith, so as to provide a fulcrum for virtue which came for the destruction of the ar istocracy of science, or rather to replace that aristoc- racy, then already destroyed. Philosophy, on the contrary, has laboured to bring back men by liberty and reason to natura l inequality, and to substitute wits for virtue by inaugurating the reign of industry. Neither of these operations has proved complete or adequate ; neither has brought men to perfection and felicity. That which is now dreamed, almost without daring to hope for it, is an alliance between the two forces so long regarded as contrary, and there is good ground for desiring it, seeing that these two great powers of th e human soul are no more opposed to one another than is the sex of man opposed to that of woman. Undoubtedly they differ, bu t their apparently contrary dispositions come only from their aptitude to meet and unite. “No less is proposed, therefore, than a universal solution of all problems?” The answer is yes, unquestionably, since we are concerned with explaining the Philosophical Stone, perpetual motion, th e secret of the Great Work and of the Universal Medicine. We shall be accused of insanity, like the divine Paracelsus, or of charlatanism, like the great and unfor tunate Agrippa. If the pyre of Urban Grandier be extinguished, the sullen pr oscriptions of silence and of calumny remain., We do not defy but are resigned to them. We have not sought the publi- cation of this book of ou r own will, and we believe th at if the time be come to bear witness, it will be borne by us or by others. We shal l therefore remain calm and shall wait. Our work is in two parts: in the one we establish the kabalistic and magical doctrine in its entirety; th e other is consecrated to the cultus, that is, to Ceremo- nial Magic. The one is that which the ancient sages term ed the Clavicle, the other that which people on the country-side st ill call the Grimoire. The numbers and subjects of the chapters which correspond in both parts, are in no sense arbitrary, and are all indicated in the great universal key, of which we gi ve for the first time a complete and adequate explanation.

E LIPHAS L EVI ."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"1 I ' A THE CANDIDATE DISCIPLINA ENSOPH KETHERI W HEN a philosopher adopted as the basis fo r a new apocalypse of human wisdom the axiom: “I think, therefor e I am”, in a measure he altered unconsciously, from the standpoint of Ch ristian Revelation, the old conc eption of the Supreme Being. I am that I am, said the Bein g of beings of Moses. I am he who thinks, says the man of Descartes, and to think being to sp eak inwardly, such a one may affirm, like the God of St. John the Evan gelist: I am he in whom and by whom the word man- ifests – In principio eras verbum. Now, what is this princi ple? It is a groundwork of speech, it is a reason fo r the existence of the word. The essence of the word is in the principle; the principl e is that which is; intelli gence is a principle which speaks. What further is intellectual light? It is speech. What is revelation? It is speech also, being is the principle, sp eech is the means, and the plenitude or development and perfection of being is the end. To speak is to create. But to say: “I think, therefore I exist”, is to argue from consequence to pr inciple, and certain contradictions which have been adduced by a great writer, Lamennais, have proved abundantly the philos ophical unsoundness of this method. I am, therefore something exists might seem to be a mo re primitive and simple foundation for experimental philosophy. I AM , THEREFORE BEING EXISTS . Ego sum qui sum, such is the first revelation of God in man and of man in the world, while it is also the first axiom of occult philosophy. xvx' wc' xvx' . Being is being. Hence this philoso- phy, having that which is fo r its principle, ca n be in no sense hypothesis or guess- work. Mercurius Trismegistus be gins his admirable symbol known under the name of the “Emerald Table,” by this threefold affi rmation: “It is true, it is certain without error, it is of all truth.” Thus, in physics, the true confirmed by experience; in phi- losophy, certitude purged from any alloy of error; in the domain of religion or the infinite, absolute truth indi cated by analogy: such are the first necessities of true science, and Magic only can impart these to its adepts. But you, before all things, who are you, thus taking this work in your hands and proposing to read it? On the pediment of a temple consecrated by antiquity to the God of Light was an inscription of two words: “Know thyself.” I impress the same counsel on every man when he seeks to approach science. Magic, which the men of old denominated the S ANCTUM R EGNUM , the Holy Kingdom, or Kingdom of God, R EGNUM D EI , exists only for kings and for priests. Are you priests? Are you kings? The priesthood of Magic is not a vulgar priesthood, and its royalty enters not into competition with the prin ces of this world.

The man who loves his own opinio ns and fears to part wi th them, who suspects new truths, who is unprepared to doubt ever ything rather than admit anything on chance, should close this book: for him it is useless and dangerous. He will fail to understand it, and it will trouble him, while if he should divine the meaning, there will be a still greater source of disquietude.

There is a true and a false science, a Di vine and an Infernal Magic – in other"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE CANDIDATE 3 words, one which is delusive and tenebrous. It is our task to reveal the one and to unveil the other, to distinguish the magi cian from the sorcerer and the adept from the charlatan. The magician avails himself of a force wh ich he knows, the sorcerer seeks to misuse that which he does not unde rstand. If it be possible in a scientific work to employ a term so vulgar and so discredited, then th e devil gives himself to the magician and the sorcerer gives himself to the devil. The magician is the sov- ereign pontiff of Nature, the sorcerer is her profaner only. The sorcerer is in the same relation to the magician that a s uperstitious and fanatical person bears to a truly religious man. Before proceeding further, le t us define Magic in a se ntence. Magic is the tradi- tional science of the secrets of Nature which has been tr ansmitted to us from the Magi. By means of this science the adept is in vested with a speci es of relative omnip- otence and can operate superhumanly, th at is, after a manner which transcends the normal possibility of men. Thereby many illustrious hierophants, such as Mer- curius Trismegistus, Osiris, Orpheus, Apol lonius of Tyana, and others whom it might be dangerous or unwis e to name, came after thei r death to be adored and invoked as gods. Thereby othe rs also – according to that ebb-and-flow of opinion which is responsible for the caprices of success – became emissa ries of infernus or suspected adventurers, like the Empero r Julian, Apuleius, the enchanter Merlin and that arch sorcerer, as he was termed in his day, the illu strious and unfortunate Cornelius Agrippa. To attain the S ANCTUM R EGNUM , in other words, the knowledge and power of the Magi, there are four indispensable cond itions – an intellig ence illuminated by study, an intrepidity which nothing can ch eck, a will which cannot be broken, and a prudence which nothing can corrupt and nothing intoxicate. T O KNOW , TO DARE , TO WILL , TO KEEP SILENCE – such are the four words of the Magus, inscribed upon the four symbolical forms of the sphi nx. These maxims can be combined after four manners and explained four times by one another. On the first page of the Book of Hermes the adept is depicted with a large hat, which, if turned down, would conceal his entire head. One hand is raised towards heaven, which he seems to command with his wand, wh ile the other is placed upon his breast; before him are the chief symbols or instrumen ts of science, and he has others hidden in a juggler's wallet. His body and arms form the letter A LEPH , the first of that alphabet which the Jews borrowed from the Egyptians: to this symbol we shall have occasion to recur later on. The Magus is truly that which the Hebr ew Kabalists term Microprosopus – oth- erwise, the creator of the l ittle world. The first of al l magical sciences being the knowledge of one's self, so is one's own cr eation first of all works of science; it comprehends the others and is the beginni ng of the Great Work. The expression, however, requires explanation.

To cleave in variably to reason it will be understood that it is nec- essary to attain independence of all tho se forces which by their fatal and inevita- ble operation produce the alternatives of l ife and death. To kn ow how to suffer, to forbear and to die – such are the firs t secrets which place us beyond reach of affliction, the desires of the flesh and th e fear of annihilati on. The man who seeks and finds a glorious death has faith in immortality and universal humanity believes in it with him and for him, ra ising altars and statues to his memory in token of eternal life. Man becomes king of the brutes only by subduing or taming them: otherwise he will be their victim or slave. Brutes are the type of our passions; they are the instinctive forces of Nature. The world is a field of battle, where liberty struggles with inertia by the oppositi on of active force. Physica l laws are millstones; if you cannot be the miller you must be the grain. You are called to be king of air, water, earth and fire; but to reign over these four li ving creatures of symbolism, it is nec- essary to conquer and enchain them. He who aspires to be a sage and to know the Great Enigma of Nature must be the he ir and despoiler of the sphinx: his the human head, in order to possess speech; his th e eagle's wings, in order to scale the heights; his the bull's flanks , in order to furrow the de pths; his the lion's talons, to make a way on the right and the left, before and behind. You therefore who seek initia tion, are you learned as Faust? Are you insensible as Job? No, is it not so? But you may b ecome like unto both if you choose. Have you overcome the vortices of vague thoughts ? Are you without indecision or capri- ciousness? Do you consent to pleasure only when you will, and do you wish for it only when you should? No, is it not so? Not at least invariably, but this may come to pass if you choose. The sphinx has not only a man's head, it has woman's breasts; do you know how to resist feminine charms? No, is it not so? And you laugh outright in replying, parading you r moral weakness for the glorification of your physical and vital force. Be it so: I allow you to rend er this homage to the ass of Sterne or Apuleius. The ass has its merit, I agree; it was consecrated to Priapus as was the goat to the god of Mendes. But take it for wh at it is worth, and decide whether ass or man shall be master. He alone can possess tr uly the pleasure of love who has conquered the love of pleasure . To be able and to forbear is to be twice able. Woman enchains you by your de sires; master your desires and you will enchain her. The greatest injury that ca n be inflicted on a man is to call him a coward. Now, what is a cowardly person ? One who neglects his moral dignity in order to obey blindly the inst incts of Nature. As a fact, in the pr esence of danger it is natural to be afraid and seek flight: why, then, is it shameful? Because honour has erected it into a law that we must pr efer our duty to our inclinations or fears."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE CANDIDATE 5 What is honour from this point of view ? It is a universal presentience of immor- tality and appreciation of the means which can lead to it. The last trophy which a man can win from death is to triumph ov er the appetite for l ife, not by despair but by a more exalted hope, which is contained in faith, for all that is noble and honest, by the undivided cons ent of the world. To lear n self-conquest is therefore to learn life, and the austerities of stoi cism were no vain parade of freedom! To yield to the forces of Nature is to follow the stream of collectiv e life and to be the slave of secondary causes. To resist and subdue Nature is to make for one's self a personal and imperishable life: it is to break free from the vicissitudes of life and death. Every man who is prepared to die rather than renounce truth and justice is most truly living, for immort ality abides in his soul. To find or to form such men was the end of all ancient initiations. Py thagoras disciplined hi s pupils by silence and all kinds of self-denial; candidates in Egypt were tried by the four elements; and we know the self-infli cted austerities of fakirs and brahmans in India for attaining the kingdom of free will and di vine independence. All macerations of asceticism are borrowed from the initiati ons of the Ancient Mysteries; they have ceased because those qualified for initiation, no longer finding initiators, and the leaders of conscience becoming in the lap se of time as uninstructed as the vulgar, the blind have grown weary of following the blind, and no one has cared to pass through ordeals the end of which was only in doubt and despair: the path of light was lost. To succeed in pe rforming something we must know that which it is pro- posed to do, or at least mu st have faith in someone wh o does know it. But shall I stake my life on a venture, or follow someone at chance wh o himself cannot see where he is going? We must not set out rashly along the pa th of the transcende ntal sciences, but, once started, we must reach the end or p erish. To doubt is to lose one's reason; to pause is to fall; to recoil is to plunge in to an abyss. You, therefore, who are under- taking the study of this book, if you persevere to the end and understand it, you will be either a monarch or madman. Do what you will with the volume, you will be unable to despise or to forget it. If you are pure, it will be your light; if strong, your arm; if holy, your religion; if wise, the rule of your wisdom. But if you are wicked, for you it will be an infernal torch; it will lacerate your breast like a pon- iard; it will rankle in your memory like a remorse; it will people your imagination with chimeras, and will drive you throug h folly to despair. You will endeavour to laugh at it, and will only gnas h your teeth; it will be like the file in the fable which the serpent tried to bite, but it destroyed all his teeth. Let us now enter on the series of initiations. I have sa id that revelation is the word. As a fact, the word, or speech, is the veil of bein g and the charac teristic sign of life. Every form is the ve il of a word, because the idea which is the mother of the word is the sole reason for the existence of forms. Every figure is a character, every character derives from and returns in to a word. For this reason the ancient"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"6 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic sages, of whom Trismegistus is the organ , formulated their sole dogma in these terms: “That which is above is like unto that which is below, and that which is below unto that which is ab ove.” In other words, the fo rm is proportional to the idea; the shadow is the measur e of the body calculated in its relation to the lumi- nous ray; the scabbard is as deep as the sword is long; the negation is in propor- tion to the contrary affirmation; pro duction is equal to destruction in the movement which preserves life; and there is no point in infinite extension which may not be regarded as the ce ntre of a circle having an expanding circumference receding indefinitely into spa ce. Every individuality is therefore indefinitely per- fectible, since the moral order is analo gous to the physical, and since we cannot conceive any point as unable to dilate, increase and radiate in a philosophically unlimited circle. What can be affirmed of the soul in its totality may be affirmed of each faculty of the soul. The intellig ence and will of man are instruments of incalculable power and capacity. But in telligence and will possess as their help-mate and instrument a faculty whic h is too imperfectly known, the omnipo- tence of which belongs exclusively to the domain of Magic. I speak of the imagina- tion, which the Kabalists term the D IAPHANE or T RANSLUCID . Imagination, in effect, is like the soul's eye; therein forms are outlined and preserved; thereby we behold the reflections of the invisible world; it is the gl ass of visions and the appa- ratus of magical life. By its intervention we heal diseases, modify the seasons, warn off death from the living and raise the dead to life, because it is the imagina- tion which exalts will a nd gives it power over the Universal Agent. Imagination determines the shape of the child in its mother's womb and decides the destiny of men; it lends wings to contagion and di rects the arms of warfare. Are you exposed in battle? Believe yourself to be invulnera ble like Achilles, and you will be so, says Paracelsus. Fear attracts bullets, but they are repelled by courage. It is well known that persons with amputated limbs feel pain in the vi cinity of members which they possess no longer. Paracelsus operated upon living blood by medicat- ing the product of a bleeding; he cured he adache at a distance by treating hair cut from the patient. By the science of the th eoretical unity and solidarity between all parts of the body, he anticipated and outs tripped the theories, or rather experi- ences, of our most celebra ted magnetists. Hence his cu res were miraculous, and to his name of Philip Theophrastus Bombast, he deserved the a ddition of Aureolus Paracelsus, with the furt her epithet of divine! Imagination is the instrument of THE ADAPTATION OF THE WORD . Imagination applied to reason is genius. Re ason is one, as ge nius is one, in al l the variety of its works. There is one principle, there is on e truth, there is one reason, there is one absolute and universal philosophy. Whatso ever is subsists in unity, considered as beginning, and returns into uni ty, considered as end. One is in one; that is to say, all is in all. Unity is the principle of numb ers; it is also the principle of motion and consequently of life., The en tire human body is recapitu lated in the unity of a sin-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE CANDIDATE 7 gle organ, which is the brain. All religion s are summed up in the unity of a single dogma, which is the affirmati on of being and its equality with itself, and this con- stitutes its mathematical value . There is only one dogma in Magic, and it is this: The visible is the manifestation of the invisible, or, in other terms, the perfect word, in things appreciable and visible, bears an exact propor tion to the things which are inappreciable by our senses a nd unseen by our eyes. The Magus raises one hand towards heaven and points down with the other to earth, saying: “Above, immensity: Below immensity stil l! Immensity equals immensity.” – This is true in things seen, as in things unseen. The first letter in the alphabet of the sacred language, Aleph, ' , represents a man extending one hand towards heaven and th e other to earth. It is an expres- sion of the active principle in everything; it is creation in heaven corresponding to the omnipotence of the word below. This le tter is a pantacle in itself – that is, a character expressing the univers al science. It is supplementary to the sacred signs of the Macrocosm and Microc osm; it explains the Ma sonic double-triangle and five-pointed blazing star; for the word is one and re velation is one. By endowing man with reason, God gave him speech; and revelation, manifold in its forms but one in its principle, consists entirely in the universal word, the interpreter of abso- lute reason. This is the significance of that term so much misconstrued, CATHOLIC - ITY , which, in modern hieratic language, means INFALLIBILITY . The universal in reason is the Absolute, and the Absolute is the infallible. If absolute reason impelled universal society to believe irresist ibly the utterance of a child, that child would be infallible by the ordination of God and of all humanity. Faith is nothing else but reasonable confidence in this un ity of reason and in this universality of the word. To believe is to place confiden ce in that which as yet we do not know when reason assures us beforehand of u ltimately knowing or at least recognizing it. Absurd are the so-called philosophers who cry: “I will never be lieve in a thing which I do not know!” Shallow reason ers! If you knew, would you need to believe? But must I believe on chan ce and apart from reason? Certainly not. Blind and haphazard beli ef is superstition and folly. We may have faith in causes which reason compels us to admit on the evidence of effects known and appreciated by science. Scien ce! Great word and great problem! What is science?

Hence have the sages of all the centuries trembled before such an absolute and terrible word; they have hesitated in arrogating to themselves the first privilege of Divinity by assuming the possession of science, and have b een contented, instead of the verb TO KNOW , with that which expresses learning , while, in place of the word SCIENCE , they have adopted that of GNOSIS , which represents simply the notion of learning by intu- ition. What, in fact, does man know? Noth ing, and at the same time he is allowed to ignore nothing. Devoid of knowledge , he is called upon to know all. Now, knowledge supposes the duad – a being who knows and an object known. The duad is the generator of society and of la w: it is also the number of the Gnosis. The duad is unity multiplying itself in or der to create, and hence in sacred sym- bolism Eve issues from the inmost boso m of Adam. Adam is the human tetra- gram, summed up in the mysterious JOD , type of the kabalist ic phallus. By adding to this JOD the triadic name of Eve, the name of Jehova is formed, the Divine Tet- ragram, which is eminently the kabalistic and magical word, xnxv , being that which the high-priest in the temple pronounced J ODCHEVA . So unity, complete in the fruitfulness of the triad, forms therewith the tetrad, which is the key of all numbers, of all movements and of all forms. By a revolution ab out its own centre, the square produces a circle e qual to itself, and this is th e quadrature of the circle, the circular movement of four e qual angles around the same point. “That which is above equals that which is below,” s ays Hermes. Here then is the duad serving as the measure of unity, and the relation of equality between above and below forms with these the tria d. The creative principle is the ideal phallus; the created principle is the form al cteis. The insert ion of the vertical phallus into the horizontal cteis forms th e stauros of the Gnostics, or the philo- sophical cross of Masons.

In the trigrams of Fohi, unity is the Y ANG and the duad is the Y IN ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE PILLARS OF THE TEMPLE 9 B OAZ and J AKIN are the names of the two symbolic al Pillars before the principal entrance of Solomon's Kabalistic Temple. In the Kabalah these Pillars explain all mysteries of antagonism, whether natural, political or religious. They elucidate also the procreative struggle between man and woman, for, according to the law of Nature, the woman must resist the man, and he must entice or overcome her. The active principle seeks th e passive principle, the plenum desires the void, the serpent's jaw attracts the se rpent's tail, and in turnin g about upon himself, he, at the same time, flies and pursues himself. Wo man is the creation of man, and uni- versal creation is the br ide of the First Principle. When the Supreme Being became a Creator, He erected a J OD or a phallus, and to provide a place in the fullness of the uncreated light, it was necessary to hollow out a cteis or trench of shadow equivalen t to the dimension de termined by his cre- ative desire, and attributed by him to the ideal J OD of the radiating light. Such is the mysterious language of the Kabalists in the Talmud, and on account of vulgar ignorance and malignity, it is impossible for us to explain or simplify it further. What then is creation? It is the house of the creative Wo rd. What is the cteis? It is the house of the phallus. What is the natu re of the active principle? To diffuse. What is that of the passiv e? To gather in and to fruc tify. What is man? He who initiates, who toils, who furrows, wh o sows. What is woman? She who forms, unites, irrigates and harvest s. Man wages war, woman brings peace about; man destroys to create, woman builds up to preserve; man is revolution, woman is con- ciliation; man is the father of Cain, woma n the mother of Abel . What also is wis- dom? It is the agreement and union of two principles, the mildness of Abel directing the activity of Cain, man guid ed by the sweet inspirations of woman, debauchery conquered by lawful marriage, revolutio nary energy softened and subdued by the gentleness of order and peac e, pride subjugated by love, science acknowledging the inspirations of faith. It is then that sci ence becomes wise and submits to the infallibilit y of universal reason, instru cted by love or universal charity. Then it can assume the name of G NOSIS , because it knows at least that as yet it cannot boast of knowing perfectly. The monad can manifest only by the duad ; unity itself and the notion of unity at once constitute two. The unity of th e Macrocosm reveals itself by the two oppo- site points of two triangles. Human unity fulfils itself to righ t and left. Primitive man is androgynous. All organs of the human body are disposed in pairs, except- ing the nose, the tongue, the um bilicus and the kabalistic J OD . Divinity, one in its essence, has two essen tial conditions as the fundam ental grounds of its being – necessity and liberty. The la ws of supreme reason neces sitate and rule liberty in God, Who is of necessi ty wise and reasonable. To make light visible God had only to postulate shadow. To manifest the truth He permitted the possibility of doubt. The shadow bodi es forth the light, and the possibility of error is essential for the temporal manif estation of truth.

Did not the heel of Michael rest rain Satan in his ascent, Satan would dethrone God, or rather he would lo se himself in the abysses of the altitude. Hence Satan is needful to Michael as th e pedestal to the statue, and Michael is necessary to Satan as the brake to th e locomotive. In analogical and universal dynamics one leans only on that which r esists. Furthermore, the universe is bal- anced by two forces which maintain it in equilibrium, be ing the force which attracts and that which repels. They exis t alike in physics, in philosophy and in religion; in physics they produce equilibr ium, in philosophy criticism, in religion progressive revelation. The ancients re presented this mystery by the conflict between Eros and Ante ros, the struggle between Jaco b and the angel, and by the equilibrium of the golden mountain, whic h gods on the one side and demons on the other encircle with the symbolic serpen t of India. It is typified also by the caduceus of Hermanubis, by th e two cherubim of the ar k, by the twofold sphinx of the chariot of Osiris and by the two seraphim – respectively black and white. Its scientific reality is demonstr ated by the phenomena of po larity, as also by the uni- versal law of sympat hies and antipathies. The undiscerning disci ples of Zoroaster divided th e duad without referring it to unity, thus separating the Pillars of the Temple and endeavouring to halve God. Conceive the Absolute as two, and you mu st immediately conceive it as three to recover the unity principle. For this reason, the material elements, analogous to the divine elements, are understood firstly as four, explained as two and exist ulti- mately as three. Revelation is the duad; every word is double, and supposes two. The ethic which results from revelation is founded on antagonism, and this results from the duad. Spirit and form attract and repel one another, like sign and idea, fiction and truth. Supreme Reason necessitates dogma wh en communicating to finite intelli- gences, and dogma by its pass age from the domain of ideas to that of forms, par- ticipates in two worlds and has inevitably two senses testifyi ng in succession or"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE PILLARS OF THE TEMPLE 11 simultaneously, that is, to the spirit a nd the flesh. So are th ere two forces in the moral region, one which attacks and one which restrains and expiates. They are represented in the mythos of Genesis by the typical pers onalities of Cain and Abel. Abel oppresses Cain by reason of his mo ral superiority; Cain to get free immortal- izes his brother by slaying him and beco mes the victim of his own crime. Cain could not suffer the life of Abel, and the blood of Abel suffers not the sleep of Cain. In the Gospel the type of Cain is re placed by that of th e Prodigal Son, whom his father forgives freely because he returns after having endured much. There is mercy and there is justice in Go d; to the just He dispenses justice and to sinners mercy. In the soul of the worl d, which is the Universal Agent, there is a current of love and a current of wrath. This ambient and al l-penetrating fluid; this ray loosened from the sun's splendour and fixed by the weight of the atmo- sphere and the power of central attraction; this body of the Holy Spirit, which we term the Universal Agent, while it was ty pified by the ancients under the symbol of a serpent devouring its tail; this electr omagnetic ether, this vital and luminous caloric, is depicted in archaic monuments by the girdle of Isis, twice-folded in a love-knot round two poles, as well as by the serp ent devouring its own tail, emblematic of prudence and of Saturn. Motion and life consist in the extreme ten- sion of two forces. “I would thou wert cold or hot,” sa id the Master. As a fact, a great sinner is more really alive than is a tepid, effeminate man, and the fullness of his return to virtue will be in propor tion to the extent of his errors. She who is destined to crush the serpent's head is intelligence, which ever rises above the stream of blind forces. The Kabalists call her the virgin of the sea, whose dripping feet the infernal dragon crawls forward to lick with his fiery tongues, and they fall asleep in delight. Hereof are the hieratic myst eries of the duad. But ther e is one, and the last of all, which must not be ma de known, the reason, acco rding to Hermes Trismegis- tus, being the malcomprehension of the vulgar, who would ascribe to the necessi- ties of science the immoral aspect of blind fatality. “By the fear of the unknown must the crowd be restrained,” he observes in another place; a nd Christ also said: “Cast not your pearls before swine, lest, trampling them under their feet, they turn and rend you.” The Tr ee of the Knowledge of G ood and Evil, of which the fruits are death, is the type of this hi eratic secret of the duad, which would be only misconstrued if divulged, and would lead commonly to the unholy denial of free will, though it is the principle of moral life . It is hence in the essence of things that the revelation of this secre t means death, and it is no t at the same time the Great Secret of Magic; but the arcanum of th e duad leads up to that of the tetrad, or more correctly proceeds therefrom, and is resolved by the triad, which contains the word of that enigma propounded by the sphinx, the findi ng of which would have saved the life, atoned for the unconscious crime a nd established the kingdom of Oedipus."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"12 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic In the hieroglyphic work of Hermes, bein g the Tarot or Book of Thoth, the duad is represented either by the horns of Isis, who has her head veiled and an open book concealed partially under her ma ntle, or otherwise by a sovereign lady, Juno, the Greek goddess, wi th one hand upli fted towards heaven and the other pointed to earth, as if formulating by this gesture the on e and twofold dogma which is the foundation of Magic and be gins the marvellous symbols of the “Emerald Table” of Hermes. In the Apocalypse of St. John there is reference to two witnesses or martyrs on whom prophetic tradition co nfers the names of Elias and Enoch-Elias, man of faith, enthusiasm, miracle; Enoch, one with him who is called Hermes by the Egyptians, honoured by the Phoenicians as Cadmus, author of the sacred alphabet and the universal ke y to the initiations of the Logos, father of the Kabalah, he who, according to sacr ed allegories, did not die like other men, but was translated to heaven , and will return at the end of time. Much the same parable is told of St. John himself, who recovered and explained in his Apocalypse the symbolism of the word of Enoch. Th is resurrection of St. John and Enoch, expected at the close of th e ages of ignorance, will be the renovation of their doc- trine by the comprehension of the kaba listic keys which unlock the temple of unity and of universal philosophy, too long occult and reserved solely for the elect, who perish at the hands of the world. But we have said that the reproduc tion of the monad by the duad leads of necessity to the conception and dogma of the triad, so we come now to this great number, which is the fullness and perfect word of unity."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"13 III g C THE TRIANGLE OF SOLOMON PLENITUDO VOCIS BINAH PHYSIS T HE perfect word is the triad, because it supposes an intelligent principle, a speaking principle and a principle spoken. The Abso lute, revealed by speech, endows this speech with a sense equi valent to itself, and in the understanding thereof creates its third self. So also th e sun manifests by its light and proves or makes this manifestatio n efficacious by heat. The triad is delineated in space by the heavenly zenith, the in finite height, con- nected with East and West by two straight diverging lines. With this visible trian- gle reason compares anoth er which is invisible, but is assumed to be equal in dimension; the abyss is its ap ex and its reversed base is parallel to the horizontal line stretching from East to West. These two triangles, co mbined in a single figure, which is the six-pointed star, form the sacred symbol of Solomon's Seal, the resplendent Star of the Macrocosm. The no tion of the Infinite and the Absolute is expressed by this sign, which is the grand pa ntacle – that is to say, the most sim- ple and complete abridgement of the science of all things. Grammar itself attributes three persons to the verb. The first is that which speaks, the second that which is spoken to , and the third the object. In creating, the Infinite Prince speaks to Himself of Himself. Such is the explanation of the triad and the origin of the dogma of the Trinity. The magical dogma is also one in three and three in one. That which is above is like or equal to that which is below. Thus, two things which resemble one an other and the word which signifies their resemblance make three. The triad is th e universal dogma. In Magic – principle, realization, adaptation; in alchemy – azot h, incorporation, tr ansmutation; in the- ology – God, incarnation, re demption; in the human so ul – thought, love and action; in the family – father, mother a nd child. The triad is the end and supreme expression of love; we seek one another as two only to become three. There are three intelligible worlds which correspond one with another by hier- archic analogy; the natural or physical, the spiritual or metaphysical, and the divine or religious worlds. From this pr inciple follows the hierarchy of spirits, divided into three orders, and again subdi vided by the triad in each of these. All these revelations are logical deductions from the first mathematical notions of being and number. Unity must multiply itself in order to become active. An indivisible, motionless and sterile prin ciple would be unity dead and incompre- hensible. Were God only one He would ne ver be Creator or Father. Were He two there would be antagonism or division in the infinite , which would mean the divi- sion also or death of all po ssible things.

So is He truly one in Himself and triple in our conception, which also leads us to behold Him as triple in Himself and one in our intelligence and our love. This is a mys- tery for the faithful and a logical necessity for the initiate into absolute and real sciences. The Word manifested by life is realiza tion or incarnation. The life of the Word accomplishing its cyclic movement is adaptation or redemption. This triple dogma was known in all sanctuaries illumi nated by the tradition of the sages. Do you wish to ascertain which is the true religion? Seek that which realizes most in the Divine Order, which humanizes God and makes man divine, which preserves the triadic dogma intact, which clothes th e Word with flesh by making God man- ifest to the hands and eyes of the most igno rant, which in fine ap peals to all in its doctrine and can adapt itself to all – the religion which is hierarchic and cyclic, having allegories and images for children, an exalted philosophy for grown men, sublime hopes and sweet co nsolations for the old. The primeval sages, when seeking the Fi rst of Causes, behold good and evil in the world. They considered shadow and li ght; they compared winter with spring, age with youth, life with de ath, and their conclusion was this: The First Cause is beneficent and severe; It gives and takes away life. Then are there two contrary principles, the one good and the other evil , exclaimed the disciples of Manes. No, the two principles of unive rsal equilibrium are not contrary, although contrasted in appearance, for a singular wisdom opposes one to anot her. Good is on the right, evil on the left; but the supreme excellence is above both, applyi ng evil to the vic- tory of good and good to the amendment of evil. The principle of harmony is in unity, and it is this which imparts such power to the uneven number in Magic. Now, the mo st perfect of the o dd numbers is three, because it is the trilogy of unity. In the tr igrams of Fohi, the superior triad is com- posed of three YANG , or masculine figures, because nothing passive can be admit- ted into the idea of God, considered as the principle of production in the three worlds. For the same reason, the Christia n Trinity by no means permits the per- sonification of the mother, who is shown forth implicitly in that of the Son. For the same reason, also, it is contrary to the laws of hieratic and orthodox symbol- ogy to personify the Holy Ghost under th e form of a woman. Woman comes forth from man as Nature comes forth from Go d; so Christ Himsel f ascends to heaven and assumes the Virgin Mother: we speak of the ascension of th e Saviour, and the assumption of the Mother of God. God, co nsidered as Father, has Nature for His daughter; as Son, He has the Virgin fo r His mother and the Church for His bride; as Holy Spirit, He regenerates and fructi fies humanity. Hence, in the trigrams of Fohi, the three inferior YIN correspond to the three superior YANG , for these tri- grams constitute a pantacle like that of the two triangles of Solomon, but with a triadic interpretation of the si x points of the blazing star."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE TRIANGLE OF SOLOMON 15 Dogma is only divine inasmuch as it is tr uly human – that is to say, in so far as it sums up the highest reason of humanity. So also the Master, Whom we term the Man-God, called Himself the Son of Man. Revelation is the expression of belief accepted and formulated by universal reason in the human word, on which account it is said that th e divinity is human and the humanity divine in the Man- God., We affirm all this philosophically, not theologically, without infringing in any way on the teaching of the Church , which condemns and must always con- demn Magic. Paracelsus and Agrippa di d not set up altar against altar but bowed to the ruling religion of their time: to the elect of science, the things of science; to the faithful, the things of faith. In his hymn to the royal Sun, the Empero r Julian gives a theory of the triad which is almost identical w ith that of the illuminated Swedenborg. The sun of the divine world is the infinite, spiritual an d uncreated light, which is verbalized, so to speak, in the philosophical world, and becomes the fount ain of souls and of truth; then it incorporates and becomes visible light in the sun of the third world, the central sun of our suns, of which the fixed stars are the ever-living sparks. The Kabalists compare the spirit to a subs tance which remains fluid in the divine medium and under the influe nce of the essential light , its exterior, however, becoming solidified, like wa x when exposed to air, in the colder realms of reason- ing or of visible forms. The se shells, envelopes petrified or carnified, were such an expression possible, are the source of er rors or of evil, which connects with the heaviness and hardness of animal envelopes. In the book Zohar , and in that of the Revolution of Souls , perverse spirits or evil demo ns are never called otherwise than shells – cortices . The cortices of the world of spirits are transparent, while those of the material world are opaque. Bodies are only temp orary shells, whence souls have to be liberated; but those who in this life obey the flesh build up an interior body or fluidic sh ell, which, after death, be comes their prison-house and torment, until the time arrives when they succeed in dissolving it in the warmth of the divine light, towards which, howe ver, the burden of their grossness hinders them from ascending. Indeed, they can do so only after infin ite struggles, and by the mediation of the just, who stretch forth their hand s towards them. During the whole period of the process they are devoure d by the interior activity of the cap- tive spirit, as in a burning furnace. Th ose who attain the pyre of expiation burn themselves thereon, like He rcules upon Mount Oetna, and so are delivered from their sufferings; but the courage of the ma jority fails before this ordeal, which seems to them a second death mo re appalling than the first , and so they remain in hell, which is rightly and actually eter nal; but souls are never precipitated nor even retained despit e themselves therein."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"16 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic The three worlds correspond together by means of the thirty-two paths of light, which are as steps of a sacred ladder. Ev ery true thought corresponds to a Divine Grace in heaven and a good work on earth; every Grace of God manifests a truth, and produces one or many ac ts; reciprocally, every act affects a truth or falsehood in the heavens, a grace or a punishmen t. When a man pronounces the Tetragram – say the Kabalists – the nine celestial real ms sustain a shock, and then all spirits cry out one upon another: “W ho is it thus disturbing the kingdom of heaven?” Then does the earth communicate unto the fi rst sphere the sins of that rash being who takes the Eternal Name in vain, and the accusing word is transmitted from circle to circle, from star to st ar, and from hierarchy to hierarchy. Every utterance possesses thr ee senses, every act has a triple range, every form a triple idea, for the Absolute corresponds from world to world by its forms. Every determination of human will modifies Na ture, concerns philosophy and is written in heaven. There are consequently two fata lities, one resulting from the Uncreated Will in harmony with its proper wisdom, the other from created wills in accor- dance with the necessity of secondary causes in their correspondence with the First Cause. There is hence nothing indiff erent in life, and our seeming most sim- ple resolutions do often determine an inca lculable series of bene fits or evils, above all in the affinities of our D IAPHANE with the Great Magical Agent, as we shall explain elsewhere. The triad, being the fundamental princi ple of the whole Kabalah, or Sacred Tradition of our fathers, was necessarily the fundamenta l dogma of Christianity, the apparent dualism of wh ich it explains by the in tervention of a harmonious and all-powerful unity. Chri st did not put His teachi ng into writing, and only revealed it in secret to His favoured disciple, the on e Kabalist, and he a great Kabalist, among the apostles. So is th e Apocalypse the book of the Gnosis or Secret Doctrine of the first Christians, and the key of th is doctrine is indicated by an occult versicle of th e Lord's Prayer, which the Vulgate leaves untranslated, while in the Greek Rite, which preserves th e traditions of St. Jo hn, the priests only are permitted to pronounce it . This versicle, completely kabalistic, is found in the Greek text of the Gospel according to St . Matthew, and in several Hebrew copies, as follows: \u0001\u0002\u0003 \u0004\u0005\u0006 \u0007\u0004\u0002\u0003\b \t \u000b\u0004\u0003\f\u0007\u000b \r\u000b\u0003 \t \u000e\u0006\b\u000b\u000f\u0003 \u0010 \r\u000b\u0003 \t \u000e\u0005\u0011\u000b \u0007\u0003 \u0010 \u0002\u0005\u0006 \u0010 \u000b\u0003\u0012\b\u000b \u0010 \u000b\u000f\t\b . “The sacred word M ALKUTH substituted for K ETHER , which is its kabalistic correspondent, and the equipoise of G EBURAH and C HESED , repeating itself in the circles of heavens called eons by the Gn ostics, provided the keystone of the whole Christian Temple in this oc cult versicle. It has been retained by Protestants in their New Testament, but they have fa iled to discern its lofty and wonderful meaning, which would have unveiled to th em all the Mysteries of the Apocalypse."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE TRIANGLE OF SOLOMON 17 There is, however, a tradition in the C hurch that the manifestation of these mysteries is reserved till the last times. M ALKUTH , based upon G EBURAH and C HESED , is the Temple of Solomon hav- ing J AKIN and B OAZ for its Pillars; it is Adamit e dogma, founded, for the one part on the resignation of Abel and, for the other, on the labours and self reproach of Cain; it is the equilibrium of being established on nec essity and libert y, stability and motion; it is the demonstration of the universal lever sought in vain by Archimedes. A scholar whose talents were employed in the culture of obscurity, who died without seeking to be understo od, resolved this supreme equation, dis- covered by him in the Kabalah, and was in dread of its source transpiring if he expressed himself more clearly. We have seen one of his disc iples and admirers most indignant, perhaps in good faith, at the suggestion that his master was a Kabalist; but we can state notwithstanding , to the glory of th e same learned man, that his researches have shortened appr eciably our work on the occult sciences, and that the key of the tr anscendent Kabalah above al l, indicated in the arcane versicle cited above, has been applied skil lfully to an absolute reform of all sci- ences in the books of Hoene Wronski. The secret virtue of the gospels is ther efore contained in th ree words, and these three words have establish ed three dogmas and thr ee hierarchies. All science reposes upon three principles, as the sy llogism upon three terms. There are also three distinct classes, or three original and natural ranks, among men, who are called to advance from the lower to the higher. The Jews term these three series or degrees in the progress of spirits, A SSIAH , Y ETZIRAH and B RIAH . The Gnostics, who were Christian Kabalists, called them H YLE , P SYCHE and G NOSIS ; by the Jews the supreme circle was named A TZILUTH , and by the Gnostics P LEROMA . In the Tetra- gram, the triad, taken at the beginning of the word, expresses the divine copula- tion; taken at the end, it expressed the female and maternity. Eve has a name of three letters, but the primitive Adam is signified simply by the letter J OD , whence Jehovah should be pronounced Jeva, and this point leads us to the great and supreme mystery of Magic, embodied in the tetrad."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"18 IV o D THE TETRAGRAM GEBURAH CHESED PORTA LIBRARUM ELEMENTA I N Nature there are two forces producing equilibrium, and these three consti- tute a single law. Here, then , is the triad resumed in un ity, and by adding the con- ception of unity to that of the triad we are bought to the tetrad, the first square and perfect number, the source of all numer ical combinations and the principle of all forms. Affirmation, negation, discussion , solution: such are the four philosoph- ical operations of the human mind. Disc ussion conciliates negation with affirma- tion by rendering them necessary to each other. In the same way, the philosophical triad, emanating from the antagonism of th e duad, is completed by the tetrad, the four-square basis of all truth. Accordin g to consecrated dogma, there are Three Persons in God, and these Three constitute one only Deity. Three and one provide the conception of four, because unity is required to explain the three. Hence, in almost all languages, the name of God co nsists of four letters, and in Hebrew these four are really three, one of them being repeated twice, that which expresses the Word and the creation of the Word. Two affirmations make two correspondin g denials either possible or necessary. The fact of being is affirmed, and that of nothingness is denied. Affirmation as Word produces affirmation as realization or incarnation of the Word, and each of these affirmations co rresponds to the denial of its opposite. Thus, in the opinion of the Kabalists, the name of the demon or of evil is composed of the same letters as the Name of God or goodn ess, but spelt backwards. This evil is the lost reflec- tion or imperfect mirage of light in shadow. But all which exists, whether of good or evil, of light or darkness, exists and manifests by the tetr ad. The affirmation of unity supposes the number four, unless it turns in unity itself as in a vicious circle. So also the triad, as we have observed already, is explained by the duad and resolved by the tetrad, which is the s quared unity of even numbers and the qua- drangular base of the cube, regarded as unity of construction , solidity and mea- sure. The Kabalistic Tetragram, J ODHEVA , expresses God in humanity and humanity in God. The four astronomical cardinal poin ts are, relatively to us, the yea and the nay of light – East and We st – and the yea an d nay of warmth – South and North. As we have said already, according to th e sole dogma of the Kabalah, that which is in visible Nature reveals that which is in the domain of invisible Nature, or sec- ondary causes are in strict proportion a nd analogous to the manifestations of the First Cause. So is this First Cause reve aled invariably by the Cross – that unity made up of two, divide d one by the other in order to produce four; that key to the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE TETRAGRAM 19 mysteries of India and Egypt, The Tau of the patriarchs, the divine sign of Osiris, the Stauros of the Gnostics, the keystone of the temp le, the symbol of Occult Masonry; the Cross, central point of the ju nction of the right angles of two infinite triangles; the Cross, which in the French language seems to be the first root and fundamental substantive of th e verb to believe and the v erb to grow, thus combin- ing the conceptions of sci ence, religion and progress. The Great Magical Agent manifests by fo ur kinds of pheno mena, and has been subjected to the experiments of profane science under fo ur names – caloric, light, electricity, magnetism. It has received also the names of T ETRAGRAM , INRI, A ZOTH , E THER , O D , Magnetic Fluid, Soul of the Earth, Lucifer, etc. The Great Magical Agent is the fourth emanation of the life-principle, of which the sun is the third form – see the initiates of the school of Alexandria and the dogma of Hermes Trismegistus. In this way the eye of the wo rld, as the ancients called it, is the mirage of the reflection of God, and the so ul of the earth is a permanent glance of the sun which the earth conceives and gu ards by impregnation. The moon con- curs in this impregnation of the earth by reflecting a solar image during the night, so that Hermes was right when he said of the Great Agen t: “The sun is its father, the moon its mother.” Then he adds: “The wind has borne it in the belly thereof,” because the atmosphere is the recipient and, as it were, the crucible of the solar rays, by means of which there forms that living image of the sun which penetrates the whole earth, fructifies it and determines all that is produced on its surface by its emanations and permanent currents, an alogous to those of the sun itself. This solar agent subsists by two contrary forc es – one of attraction and one of projec- tion, whence Hermes says that it ascends and desce nds eternally. The force of attraction is always fixed at the centre of bodies, that of projection in their out- lines or at their surface. By this dual force all is cr eated and all preserved. Its motion is a rolling up and an enrolling which are successive and unlimited, or, rather, Simultaneous and perpetual, by spirals of opposite movements which never meet. It is the same m ovement as that of the sun, at once attracting and repelling all the planets of its system. To be acquainted with the movement of this terrestrial sun in such a manner as to be able to apply its currents and direct them, is to have accomplished the Grea t Work and to be master of the world. Armed with such a force you may make yourself adored : the crowd will believe that you are God. The absolute secret of this direction has been in th e possession of certain men, and can yet be disc overed. It is the Great Magi cal Arcanum, depending on an incommunicable axiom and on an inst rument which is the grand and unique athanor of the highest grade of H ermetists. The incommunicable axiom is enclosed kabalistically in the four le tters of the Tetragram, arranged in the following manner:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"20 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic In the letters of the words A ZOTH and INRI written kabalistically; and in the monogram of Christ as embroidered on the Labarum, which the Kabalist Postel interprets by the word ROTA, whence the adepts have formed their Taro or Tarot, by the repetition of the first letter, thus indicating the circ le, and sugge sting that the word is read backwards. All magical science is co mprised in the knowledge of this secret. To know it and have the cour age to use it is human omnipotence; to reveal it to a profane person is to lose it; to reveal it even to a disciple is to abdi- cate in favour of that disciple, who, he nceforward, possesses the right of life and death over his master – I am speaking from the magica l standpoint – and will cer- tainly slay him for fear of dying hims elf. But this has nothing in common with deeds qualified as murder in criminal legislation; the practical philosophy which is the basis and point of departure for our laws does not recognize the facts of bewitchment and of occult influences. We touch here upon extraordinary revela- tions, and are prepared for the unbelief and derision of incredulous fanaticism; voltairean religion has also its fanatics, pace the great shades who must now be lurking sullenly in the vaults of the Pantheon, while Cathol icism, strong ever in its practices and prestige, ch ants the Office overhead. The perfect word, that wh ich is adequate to the thought which it expresses, always contains virtually or supposes a tetrad: the id ea, with its three necessary and correlated forms, then the image of the thing expressed, with the three terms of the judgement which qualifie s it. When I say: “Being exists,” I af firm implicitly that the void is nonexisten t. A height, a breadth whic h the height subdivides lon- gitudinally, a depth separated from the he ight by the intersection of the breadth, such is the natural tetrad, composed of two lines at right an gles one to another. Nature has also four motion s, products of two forces which sustain each other by their tendency in an opposite direction. Now, the law which rules bodies is analo- gous to that which governs minds, and that which governs minds is the very man- ifestation of God's secret – that is to sa y, of the mystery of the creation.

In this way, the watch will wind up itself, and you will have discovered perpetual motion. The engagement should be at two ends and of extreme accuracy. Is this beyond attainment? We think not. But when it is discovered the inventor will understand by analogy all the secrets of Nature PROGRESS IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO RESIS - TANCE The absolute movement of life is thus the perp etual consequence of two contrary tendencies which are never opposed. When one seems to yield to the other, it is like a spring which is windi ng up, and you may ex pect a reaction, the moment and characteristics of which it is quite possible to foresee and determine. Hence at the period of the greatest Christian fervour was the reign of A NTICHRIST known and predicted. But Antichrist will prepare and determine the Second Advent and final triumph of the Man-God. This again is a rigorous and kabalisti- cal conclusion contained in the Gospel premises. Hence the Christian prophecy comprises a fourfold revelation: I. Fall of the old world and triumph of the Gospel under the First Advent; 2 . Great apostasy and coming of Antichrist; 3 . Fall of Antichrist and recurrence to Christian ideas; 4 . Definitive triumph of the Gospel, or Second Advent, designat ed under the name of the La st Judgement. This four- fold prophecy contains, as will be seen , two affirmations an d two negations, the idea of two ruins or universa l deaths and of two resurrections; for to every concep- tion which appears upon th e social horizon an East and a West, a Zenith and a Nadir, may be ascribed without fear of er ror. Thus is the Philosophical Cross the key of prophecy, and all gates of scienc e may be opened with the pantacle of Ezekiel, the centre of whic h is a star formed by the interlacement of two crosses. Does not human life present itself al so under these four phases or successive transformations – birth, life, death, immortality? And remark here that the immortality of the soul, necessitated as a complement of the tetrad, is kabalisti- cally proved by analogy, which is the sole dogma of truly universal religion, as it is the key of science and the universal law of Nature. As a fa ct, death can be no more an absolute end than birth is a re al beginning. Birth pr oves the preexistence of the human being, since nothing is pr oduced from nothing, and death proves immortality, since being can no more ce ase from being than nothingness can cease to be nothingness. Being and nothingness are two absolutely irreconcilable ideas, with this difference, that the idea of nothingness, which is altogether negative, issues from the very idea of being, whence even no thingness cannot be understood as an absolute negation, whilst the notion of being can never be put in comparison with that of nothingness, and still less can it come forth therefro m. To say that the world has been produced out of nothing is to advance a monstrous absurdity. All that is proceeds from what has been, a nd consequently nothing that is can ever more cease to be. The succession of forms is produced by the alternatives of move- ment; they are the phenomena of life which replace without destroying one another. All things change; nothing peri shes.

Hence they are preserved in the astral fluid, and ca n be evoked and reproduced according to the will of the sage, as we shall see when treating of second sight and the evoca- tion of memories in necromancy or other magical works. We shall return also to the Great Magical Agent in the fourth ch apter of the Ritual, where we shall com- plete our indications of the characteri stics of the Great Arcanum, and of the means of recovering this tremendous power.' Here let us add a few words on the four magical elements a nd elementary spir- its. The magical elements ar e: in alchemy, Salt, Sulp hur, Mercury and Azoth; in Kabalah, the Macroprosopus, the Microprosopus and the two Mothers; in hiero- glyphics, the Man, Eagle, Li on and Bull; in old physics, according to vulgar names and notions, air, water, earth and fire. But in magical science we know that water is not ordinary water, fire is not simply fire, etc. These expressions conceal a more recondite meaning. Modern science has d ecomposed the four elements of the ancients and reduced them to a number of so-called si mple bodies. That which is simple, however, is the primitive substan ce properly so-called; there is thus only one material element, which manifests always by the tetrad in its forms. We shall therefore preserve the wise di stinction of elementary appe arances admitted by the ancients, and shall recognize air, fire, earth and water as the four positive and vis- ible elements of Magic. The subtle and the gross, the swift and sl ow solvent, or the instruments of heat and cold, constitute, in occult physics, the two positive and negative principles of the tetrad, and should be thus tabulated: Thus, air and earth represent the male prin ciple; fire and water are referable to the female principle, since the Philoso phical Cross of pant acles, as affirmed already, is a primitive and elementary hi eroglyph of the lin gam of the gymnoso- phists. To these four elementary forms correspond the four following philosophi- cal ideas Spirit, Matter, Motion, Rest. As a fact, all science is comprised in the understanding of these four things, which alchemy has reduced to three – the Absolute, the Fixed and the Volatile – referred by the Kabalah to the essential idea of God, Who is absolute reason, necessity and liberty, a threefold notion expressed in the occult book s of the Hebrews.

Now, created spirits, being called to emancipation by trial, are placed from their birth between th ese four forces, two positive a nd two negative, and have it in their power to affirm or de ny good, to choose life or de ath. To discover the fixed point, that is, the moral ce ntre of the Cross, is the first problem which is given them to resolve; their initial conquest mu st be that of their own liberty. They begin by being drawn, some to the North, others to the South; some to the right, others to the left; and in so far as they are not free, they cannot have the use of reason, nor can they take flesh otherwi se than in animal forms. These unemanci- pated spirits, slaves of th e four elements, are those which the Kabalists call ele- mentary daimons, and they people the el ements which correspond to their state of servitude. Sylphs, undines, gnomes and sa lamanders really exist therefore, some wandering and seeking incarn ation, others incarnate a nd living on this earth. These are vicious and imperfect men. We sha ll return to this subject in the fif- teenth chapter, which treats of enchantments and demons. That is also an occult tradition by wh ich the ancients were led to admit the existence of four ages in the world, only it was not made known to the vulgar that these ages are successive and are renewed, li ke the four seasons of the year. Thus, the golden age has passed, and it is yet to come. This, however, belongs to the spirit of prophecy, and we shall speak of it in the ninth chapter, which is con- cerned with the initiate and the seer. If we now add the idea of unity to the tetrad, we shall have, together and separately, the conceptions of the divine synthesis and analysis, the god of the initiates and th at of the profane. Here the doctrine becomes more popular, as it passes from the domain of the abstract: the grand hierophant intervenes."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"24 V x E THE PENTAGRAM GEBURAH ECCE H EREUNTO we have exposed the magical dogma in its mo re arid and abstruse phases; now the enchantments begin; no w we can proclaim wonders and reveal most secret things. The Pentagram signi fies the domination of the mind over the elements, and the demons of air, the spirits of fire, the phantoms of water and ghosts of earth are enchained by this si gn. Equipped therewith, and suitably dis- posed, you may behold the infinite through the medium of that faculty which is like the soul's eye, and you will be mini stered unto by legions of angels and hosts of fiends. But here, in the first place, let us establ ish certain principles. There is no invis- ible world; there are, however, many de grees of perfection in organs. The body is the coarse and, as it were, the perishable cortex of the soul. The soul can perceive of itself, and independently of the mediati on of physical organs, by means of its sensibility and its D IAPHANE – the things, both spiritual and corporeal, which are existent in the universe. Spiritual and corporeal are simply terms which express the degrees of tenuity or density in substance. What is called the imagination within us is only the soul's inherent fa culty of assimilating the images and reflec- tions contained in the living light, be ing the Great Magnetic Agent. Such images and reflections are revelation s when science intervenes to reveal us their body or light. The man of genius d iffers from the dreamer and the fool in this only, that his creations are analogous to truth, while those of the fool and the dreamer are lost reflections and bewrayed images. Hen ce, for the wise man, to imagine is to see, as, for the magician, to speak is to create. It fo llows that, by means of the imagination, demons and spirits can be behe ld really and in truth; but the imagi- nation of the adept is diap hanous, whilst that of the crowd is opaque; the light of truth traverses the one as ordinary lig ht passes through clear glass, and is refracted by the other, as when ordinary light impinges upon a vitreous block, full of scoriae and foreign matter. That which most contributes to the errors of the vulgar is the reflection of depraved imagina tions one in the other. But in virtue of positive science, the seer kn ows that what he imagin es is true, and the event invariably confirms his visi on. We shall state in the Ritual after what manner this lucidity can be acquired. It is by means of this light that stat ic visionaries place themselves in communi- cation with all worlds, as so frequent ly occurred to Swedenborg, who notwith- standing was imperfectly luci d, seeing that he did not distinguish reflections from rays, and often intermingled chimerical fancies with his most admirable dreams."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE PENTAGRAM 25 We say dreams, because dream is the co nsequence of a natural and periodical ecstasy which we term sleep; to be in ecstasy is to sl eep; magnetic somnambulism is a production and direction of ecstasy. The errors which occur therein are occa- sioned by reflections from the D IAPHANE of waking persons, and, above all, of the magnetizer. Dream is vision produced by the refraction of a ray of truth. Chimeri- cal fantasy is hallucination occasioned by a reflection. The temptation of St. Anthony, with its nightmares and its monst ers, represents the confusion of reflec- tions with direct rays. So long as the soul struggles it is reasonable; when it yields to this species of invading intoxication it becomes mad. To di sentangle the direct ray, and separate it from the reflection – such is the work of the initiate. Here let us state distinctly that this work is being performed continually in the world by some of the flower of mank ind; that there is hence a permanent revelation by intuition; and that there is no insuperable barrier whic h separates souls, because there are no sudden interruptions and no high walls in Nature by which minds can be divided from one another. All is transition and blending, wherefore, assuming the perfectibility, if not infinite at least inde finite, of human faculties, it will be understood that ever y person can attain to see all, and therefore to know all. There is no void in Natu re: all is peopled. There is no true death in Nature: all is alive. “Seest thou that star?” asked Na poleon of Cardinal Fesch. “No, Sire.” “I see it,” said the Emperor, and he most certainly did. When great men are accused of superstition, it is because they beho ld what remains unseen by the crowd. Men of genius differ from simp le seers by their faculty of communicating sensibly to others that which they the mselves perceive, and of maki ng themselves believed by the force of enthusiasm and sy mpathy. Such persons are the media of the Divine Wo r d . Let us now specify the manner in whic h visions operate. All forms correspond to ideas, and there is no idea which ha s not its proper and peculiar form. The pri- mordial light, which is the vehicle of al l ideas, is the mother of all forms, and transmits them from emanation to emanat ion, merely diminished or modified"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"26 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic according to the density of the media. Secondary forms are reflections which return to the font of the emanated light. The forms of object s, being a modifica- tion of light, remain in the light where the reflection consigns them. Hence the Astral Light, or terrestrial fluid, which we call the Grea t Magnetic Agent, is satu- rated with all kinds of im ages or reflections. Now, our soul can evoke these, and subject them to its D IAPHANE , as the Kabalists term it. Such images are always present before us, and are effaced only by the more powerful impressions of real- ity during waking hours, or by preocc upation of the mind, which makes our imagination inattentive to the fluidic panorama of th e Astral Light. When we sleep, this spectacle presents itself spontaneously before us, and in this way dreams are produced – dreams vague and incoherent if some governing will do not remain active during the sleep, giving , even unconsciously to our intelligence, a direction to the dream, which then tr ansforms into vision. Animal Magnetism is nothing but an artificial sleep produced by the voluntary or enforced union of two wills, one of which is awake while the other slumbers – that is, one of which directs the other in the choice of reflect ions for the transformation of dreams into visions and the attainment of truth by means of image s. Thus, somnambulists do not actually travel to the place where they are sent by the magnetizer; they evoke its images in the Astral Light and can behold nothing which does not exist in that light. The Astral Light has a direct action on the n erves, which are its conductors in the animal economy, transmitting it to the brain. It follows that, in a state of somnambulism, it is possible to see by means of the nerves, without being depen- dent on radiant light, the astral fluid being a latent light, in the same way that physics recognize the existe nce of a latent caloric. Magnetism between two perso ns is certainly a wond erful discovery, but the magnetizing of a person by himself, aw akening his own lucidi ty and directing it himself at will, is the perf ection of magical art. The secr et of this Great Work does not remain for discovery; it has been known and practised by a great number of initiates, above all by the celebrated Apol lonius of Tyana, who has left a theory concerning it, as we shall see in the “Ritual”. The secret of magnetic lucidity and the direction of the phenomena of magn etism depend on two things – agreement of minds and complete union of wills, in a direction wh ich is possible and deter- mined by science. This is for the oper ation of magnetism between two or more persons. Solitary magnetism requires preparations of which we have spoken in, our initial chapter, when enumerating and establishing in all their difficulty the essential qualities of a veritable adept. In the follow ing chapters we shall elucidate further this importan t and fundamental point. The empire of will over the Astral Light, which is th e physical soul of the four elements, is represented in Magic, by the Pentagram, pl aced at the head of this chapter.

Let us explain this marvel briefly. All created beings communicate with one another by signs, and all adhere to a certain number of tr uths expressed by de terminate forms. The perfection of forms increases in proporti on to the emancipation of spirits, and those that are not overweighted by the chai ns of matter, recogn ize by intuition out of hand whether a sign is the expression of a real power or of a precipitate will. The intelligence of the wise man therefore gives value to his pantacle, as science gives weight to his will, and spirits co mprehend this power immediately. Thus, by means of the Pentagram, spirit s can be forced to appear in vision, whether in the waking or sleeping state, BY THEMSELVES LEADING BEFORE OUR D IAPHANE THEIR REFLECTION , WHICH EXISTS IN THE A STRAL L IGHT , IF THEY HAVE LIVED , OR A REFLECTION ANALOGOUS TO THEIR SPIRITUAL LOGOS IF THEY HAVE NOT LIVED ON EARTH . This explains all visions, and acco unts for the dead invariably appearing to seers, either such as they were upon earth, or such as they are in the grave, never as they subsist in a condition which escapes th e perceptions of our actual organism. Pregnant women are influenced more than others by the Astral Light, which concurs in the formation of the child, and offers th em incessant r eminiscences of the forms that abound therein. This explains how it is that women of the highest virtue deceive the malignit y of observers by equivocal resemblances. On the fruit of their marriage they im press frequently an image which has struck them in dream, and it is thus that the same phy siognomies are perpetuated from genera- tion to generation. The kaba listic usage of the Pentagr am can determine therefore the appearance of unborn children, and an initiated woman might endow her son with the characteristics of Nero or Achill es, with those of Louis XIV or Napoleon. We shall indicate the method in our “Ritual”. The Pentagram is called in Kabalah the Sign of the Microcosm, that sign so exalted by Goethe in the be autiful monologue of Faust: “Ah, how do all my senses leap at th is sight! I feel the young and sacred pleasure of life quivering in my ne rves and veins. Was it a God who traced this sign which stills the vertigo of my soul, fills my poor heart with joy and, in a mysterious rapture, unveils the forces of Nature around me? Am I myself a God? All is so clear to me: I behold in these simple lines the revela- tion of active Nature to my soul. I re alise for the first time the truth of the wise man's words: The world of spirits is not closed! Thy sense is obtuse, thy heart is dead! Arise! Bath e, O adept of science, th y breast, still enveloped by an earthly veil, in the splendours of th e dawning day!” (Faust , Part i. sc. I.)

The success of this experiment, details of which, as regards its prin ciples, will be found in the corresponding chapter of the present doct rinal part, establishes a new pathologi- cal fact, which men of true science will admit without difficulty. The experience, repeated even to a third time, gave resu lts truly extraordinary, but positive and unmixed with hallucination. We invite scep tics to make a conscientious and intel- ligent trial on their own part before shrugging their shoulders and smiling. The figure of the Pentagram, completed in a ccordance with science and used by the author in his experimen t, is that which is found at th e head of this chapter, and it is more perfect than any in the Keys of Solomon or in the Magical Calendars of Tycho Brahe and Duchentau. We must rema rk, however, that the use of the Pen- tagram is most dangerous for operators who are not in possession of its complete and perfect understanding. The direction of the points of the star is in no sense arbitrary, and may change the entire character of an operation, as we shall explain in the “Ritual”. Paracelsus, that innovator in Magic, who surpassed al l other initiates in his unaided practical success, af firms that every magical fi gure and every kabalistic sign of the pantacles which compel spirits , may be reduced to two, which are the synthesis of all the others ; these are the Sign of th e Macrocosm or the Seal of Solomon, the form of which we have gi ven already, and that of the Microcosm, more potent even than the first – that is to say, the Pentagr am, of which he pro- vides a most minute description in his occult philoso phy. If it be asked how a sign can exercise so much power over spirits, we inquire in re turn why the whole Christian world bows down before that Sign of the Cross? The sign is nothing by itself, and has no force apart from the doct rine of which it is the summary and the logos. Now, a sign which su mmarizes, in their expression , all the occult forces of Nature, a sign which has ever exhibited to elementary spirits and others a power greater than their own, fills them natura lly with respect and fear, enforcing their obedience by the empire of science and of will over ignorance and weakness. By the Pentagram also is me asured the exact proportio ns of the great and unique Athanor necessary to the confection of the Philosophical Stone and the accom- plishment of the Great Work . The most perfect alembic in which the Quintessence can be elaborated is conformable to this figure, and the Quintessence itself is rep- resented by the Sign of the Pentagram."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"29 VI n F MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUM TIPHERETH UNCUS S UPREME intelligence is necessarily reas onable. God, in philosophy, may be only a hypothesis, but He is a hypothes is imposed by good sense on human rea- son. To personify the Absolute Reason is to determine the Divi ne Ideal. Necessity, liberty and reason – these are the great a nd supreme triangle of the Kabalists, who name reason K ETHER , necessity C HOKMAH , and liberty B INAH , in their first or Divine Triad. Fatality, will and power, such is the magical triad, which corre- sponds in things human to the Divine Tria d. Fatality is the inevitable sequence of effects and causes in a determi ned order. Will is the dir ecting faculty of intelligent forces for the conciliation of the liberty of persons with the necessity of things. Power is the wise application of will which enlists fatali ty itself in the accomplish- ment of the desires of the sage. When Moses smote the rock, he did not create the spring of water; he revealed it to the people, because occult science had made it known to himself by means of the divining rod. It is in like manner with all mira- cles of Magic; a law exists, which is ignored by the vul gar and made use of by the initiate. Occult laws are often opposed di ametrically to common ideas. For exam- ple, the crowd believes in the sympathy of things which are alik e and in the hostil- ity of things contrary, but it is the opposi te which is the true law. It used to be affirmed that Nature abhors the void, but it should be said that Nature desires it, were the void not, in physics, the most irrational of fict ions. In all things the vul- gar mind habitually takes shadow for reality, turns its back upon light and is reflected in the obscurity wh ich it projects itself. The fo rces of Nature are at the disposal of one who knows how to resi st them. Are you master sufficiently of yourself to be never in toxicated? Then will you direct the terrible and fatal power of intoxication. If you would make oth ers drunk, possess them with the desire of drink, but do not partake of it yourself. That man will dispose of the love of oth- ers who is master of his own. If you wo uld possess, do not gi ve. The world is mag- netized by the light of the sun, and we are magnetized by the Astral Light of the world. That which operates in the body of the planet re peats itself in us. Within us there are three analogical and hiera rchic worlds, as in all Nature. Man is the Microcosm or little world, a nd, according to the doctrine of analo- gies, whatsoever is in the great world is reproduced in the small. Hence we have three centres of fluidic attrac tion and projection – the br ain, the heart, or epigas- tric region, and the genital organ. Each of these instruments is one and twofold – in other words, we find the suggestion of the triad therein. Each attracts on one side and repels on the other. It is by means of such apparatus that we place our-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"30 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic selves in communication with the universal flui d supplied to us by the nervous system. These three centres are, moreover, the seat of a triple magnetic operation, as we shall explain elsewh ere. When the Magus has attained lucidity, whether through the mediation of a pythoness or by his own development, he communi- cates and directs at will the magnetic vibrations in th e whole mass of the Astral Light, the currents of which he divines by means of the Magic Wand, which is a perfected divining rod. By the aid of these vibrations he in fluences the nervous system of persons made subj ect to his action, accelerat es or suspends the currents of life, soothes or tortures, heals or hurts – in fine, slays or brings to life. ...Here, however, we pause in presence of the smile of incredulity. Let us permit it to enjoy the easy triumph of denyin g what it does not know. We shall demonstrate later on that death is preceded always by a lethargic sleep, and hence takes place gradually; that resurrec tion is possible in certain cases; that lethargy is a real but uncomp leted death; and that the final paroxysm is in many cases subsequent to inhumation. This, howe ver, is not the subject of the present chapter. We af firm now that a lucid will ca n act upon the mass of the Astral Light, and in concurrence with other wills, which it absorbs and draws along, can determine great an d irresistible currents. We say also that the Astral Light condenses or rarefies in proportion as currents accumulate, more or less, at certain Centres. When it is deficient in the energy requir ed for the support of life, diseases accompanied by sudden decompos ition follow, of a kind which baffle physicians. There is no other cause, for example, in the case of cholera-morbus, and the swarms of animalculae observed or supposed by some specialists may be the effect rather than the cause. Cholera should be treated therefore by insufflation, did not the operator thereby run the chance of an exchange with the patien t which would be very for- midable for himself. Every in telligent effort of will is a projection of the human fluid or light, and here it is needful to distinguish the human from the Astral Light, and Animal from Universal Magnet ism. In making use of the word fluid, we employ an accepted expre ssion, and seek to be underst ood in this manner, but we are far from deciding th at the latent light is a fl uid. Everything prompts us, on the contrary, to prefer the sy stem of vibrations in the explanation of this phenom- enal subject. However it may be, the light in questi on, being the instrument of life, cleaves naturally to all living centres, attaches itsel f to the nucleus of planets, even as to the heart of man – and by the heart we understand magically the great sympathetic – identifying itse lf with the individual life of the being which it ani- mates, and it is by this quality of symp athetic assimilation that it is distributed without confusion. Hence it is terrestrial in its affinity with the sphere of the earth and human exclusively in its affinity with men. It is for this reason that electricity, caloric, light and magnetism, produced by ordinary physical means, not only do no t originate, but tend rather to neutralize"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUM 31 the effects of Animal Magnetism. The Astral Light, subordinated to a blind mech- anism, and proceeding from arbitrary automatic centres, is a dead light and works mathematically, following given im pulsions or fatal laws. The human light is fatal only to the ignorant, performing chance experiments; in the seer it is sub- jected to intelligence, submitted to imagi nation and dependent on will. This light, continually projected by the will, constitu tes the personal atmospheres of Sweden- borg. The body absorbs what environs it and radiates perpetually by projecting its influences and invisible molecules; it is the same with the spirit, so that this phe- nomenon, by some mystics termed Respiration, has really the influence, both physical and moral, which is assigned to it. It is undoubt edly contagious to breathe the same air as diseased persons, a nd to be within the circle of attraction and expansion which surrounds the wicked. When the magnetic atmosphere of two persons is so equilibrated that the attractive faculty of one draws the expa nsive faculty of the other, a tendency is produced which is termed sympathy; then imagination, calling up to it all the rays or reflections analogous to that which it experiences, makes a poem of the desires which captivate will, and if the persons d iffer in sex, it occasions in them, or more commonly in the weaker of the two, a co mplete intoxication of the Astral Light, which is termed passion par excellence, or love. Love is one of the great instru- ments of magical power, but it is categorically forbidde n to the Magus, at least as an intoxication or passion. Woe to the Samson of the Kabalah if he permit himself to be put asleep by Delilah! The Herc ules of science, wh o exchanges his royal sceptre for the distaff of Omphale, will s oon experience the vengeance of Dejanira, and nothing will be left for him but the py re of Mount Oetna, in order to escape the devouring folds of the coat of Nessus. Sexual love is ever an illusion, for it is the result of an imaginary mirage. The Astral Light is the universal seducer, typi- fied by the serpent of Gen esis.' This subtle agent, ever active, ever vigorous, ever fruitful in alluring dreams a nd sensuous images; this for ce, which of itself is blind and subordinated to every will, whether fo r good or evil; this ever-renewing circu- lus of unbridled life, which produces vert igo in the imprudent; this corporeal spirit; this fiery body; this impalpable omnipresen t ether; this monstrous seduc- tion of Nature – how shall we define it comprehensiv ely and how characterize its action? To some extent indifferent in itsel f, it lends itself to good as to evil; it transmits light and propagat es darkness; it may be ca lled equally Lucifer and Lucifuge; it is a serpent but it is also an aureole; it is a fire, but it may belong equally to the torments of infernus or the sacrifice of incense offered up to heaven. To dispose of it, we must, like the predes tined woman, set our foot upon its head. In the elementary world water correspo nds to the kabalisti c woman and fire to the serpent. To subdue the serpent, that is, to govern the circle of the Astral Light, we must place ourselves outside its curren ts: in other words, we must isolate our- selves. For this reason Apollonius of T yana wrapped himself completely in a man-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"32 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic tle of fine wool, setting his feet thereon and drawin g it over his head. Then he bent his back in semicircular fashion, a nd closed his eyes, after performing cer- tain rites – probably magnetic passes a nd sacramental words, designed to fix imagination and determine the action of will. Th e woollen mantle is of great use in Magic and was the common conveyance of sorcerers on their way to the Sab- bath, which proves that the sorcerers di d not really go to the Sabbath, but the Sabbath came to the sorcerers, when isolat ed in their mantle, and brought before their T RANSLUCID images analogous to their magical preoccupations, combined with reflections of all kindred acts accomplished previo usly in the world. This torrent of universal life is repre sented also in religious doctrines by the expiatory fire of hell. It is the instrument of initiation, the monster to be over- come, the enemy to subdue; it is this which brings to our evocations and to the conjurations of Goetic Magic such swar ms of larvae and phantoms. Therein are preserved all the fantastic and fortuitous assemblages of forms which people our nightmares with such abominable monstrosit ies. To be sucked down by this whirl- ing stream is to fall into abysses of madn ess, more frightful than those of death; to expel the shades of this chaos and compel it to give perfect forms to our thoughts – this is to be a man of geni us; it is to create, it is to be victorious over hell! The Astral Light directs the instincts of anim als and offers battle to the intelligence of man, which it strives to pervert by the enticements of its re flections and the illu- sion of its images. It is a fatal and inevitable operat ion, directed and made still more calamitous by elemen tary spirits and suffering souls, whose restless wills seek out sympathies in our weakness and tempt us, but not so much to destroy us as to win friend s for themselves. That book of conscienc es which, according to Ch ristian doctrine, shall be opened at the last day, is no other th an the Astral Light, which preserves the impress of every logos, that is to say, of all actions and all forms. Our acts modify our magnetic respiration in such a way that a seer, meeting any person for the first time, can tell whether he is innocen t or criminal, and what are his virtues or his crimes. This faculty, which belongs to divination, was called by the Christian mystics of the early Church the discernment of spirits. Those who abdicate the empire of reas on and permit their wills to wander in pursuit of reflections in the Astral Light, are subject to alternations of mania and melancholy which have originated all the marvels of demoniacal possession, though it is true, at the same time, that by means of these refl ections impure spir- its can act upon such souls, make use of them as docile instruments and even habitually torment their or ganism, wherein they enter and reside by obsession, or embryonically. These kabalist ic terms are explained in the Hebrew book of the Revolution of Souls, of which our thirteenth chapte r will contain a succinct analy- sis.

The inquisitive who, without being adepts, busy themselves with evocations or occult magnetism, are like children playing with fire in the neighbourhood of a cask of gunpowder; sooner or later they will fall victims to some terrible explosion. To be isolated from the Astral Light it is not enough to envelop one's self in a woollen fabric; we must also, and above a ll, impose absolute tranquillity on mind and heart; we must have qu itted the world of passions and be assured of persever- ance in the spontaneous opera tions of an inflexible wi ll. We must reiterate fre- quently the acts of this will, for, as we shall see in the introduction to the “Ritual”, it is by acts only that confidence is a ssured to the will, as the power and perpetu- ity of religions depend on their Rites and Ceremonies. There are intoxicating substances, whic h, by increasing nervous sensibility, exalt the power and conseque ntly the allurements of as tral representations; by the same means, but pursuing a contrary course, spirits may be terrified and dis- turbed. These substances, of themselves magnetic a nd magnetized further by operators, are what people term philtre s and enchanted potions. But we shall not enter here upon this dangerous aspect of the practice, which Cornelius Agrippa himself terms venomous M agic. It is true that there ar e no longer pyres for sorcer- ers, but always, and more than ever, ar e there penalties dealt out to malefactors. Let us confine ourselves therefore to statin g, as the occasion offers, the reality of such power. To direct the Astral Light we must understand also its twofold vibration, as well as the balance of forces termed magical equilibrium, expressed in the Kabalah by the senary. Considered in its fi rst cause, this equilibrium is the will of God; it is liberty in man and mathemati cal equilibrium in matter. Equilibrium produces stability and dura tion. Liberty generates the immortality of man,” and the will of God gives effect to the laws of Eternal Reason. Equilibrium in ideas is reason and in forces power. Equilibrium is e xact; fulfil its law, and it is there; vio- late it, however slightly, and it is destroye d. For this reason nothing is useless or lost. Every utterance and every movement are for or against equilibrium, for or against truth, which is composed of for an d against conciliated, or at least equili- brated. We shall state in the introduction to the “Ritual” ho w magical equilibrium should be produced, and why it is n ecessary to the succe ss of all operations. Omnipotence is the most ab solute liberty; now, absolute liberty cannot exist apart from perfect equilibrium. Magical e quilibrium is hence one of the first con- ditions of success in the opera tions of science, and must be sought even in occult chemistry, in learning to combine cont raries without neutralizing them by one another.

This warrior is armed with a fiery sword and holds in his left hand a sceptre surmounted by a triangle and a sphere. Th e cube is the Philos ophical Stone; the sphinxes are the two forces of the Great Agent, corresponding to J AKIN and B OAZ , the two Pillars of the Temp le; the cuirass is the knowl edge of Divine Things, which renders the wise man invulnerable to human assaults; the sceptre is the Magic Wand; the fiery sword is the symbol of victor y over the deadly sins, seven in number, like the virtues, the conceptions of both being typified by the ancients under the figures of the seven planets th en known. Thus, faith – that aspiration towards the infinite, that noble self-relian ce sustained by confid ence in all virtues – the faith which in weak natures may de generate into pride, was represented by the Sun; hope, the enemy of avarice, by the Moon; charity, in opposition to luxury, by Venus, the bright star of morning and evening; strength, superior to wrath, by Mars; prudence, hostile to idleness, by Me rcury; temperance, opposed to gluttony, by Saturn, who was gi ven a stone instead of his childre n to devour; finally, justice, in opposition to envy, by Jupiter, the conqueror of th e Titans. Such are the sym- bols borrowed by astronom y from the Hellenic cultus . In the Kabalah of the Hebrews, the Sun represents th e angel of light; the Moon , the angel of aspirations and dreams; Mars, the destroying angel; Venus, the angel of loves; Mercury, the angel of progress; Jupiter, the angel of po wer: Saturn, the ange l of the wilderness. They were named also Michael, Gabriel, Samael, Anael, Raphael, Zachariel and Orifiel. These governing potencies of souls shar ed human life during successive peri- ods, which astrologers measured by the re volutions of the corresponding planets. But kabalistic astrology must not be confounded with that which is called judicial. We will explain this distinct ion. Infancy is dedicated to the Sun, childhood to the Moon, youth to Mars and Venus, manhood to Mercury, ripe age to Jupiter, and old age to Saturn.

St. John, depositary of the Secret Doc- trine of Christ, has commemorated this se quence in the kabalistic book of the Apocalypse, which he represe nts sealed with seven seals . We meet also the seven genii of ancient mythologies, and the Cups and Swords of the Tarot. The doctrine concealed under these emblems is pure Kaba lah, already lost by the Pharisees at the time of Christ's advent . The scenes which succeed on e another in this wonder- ful prophetic epic are so many pantacles, the keys of which are the ternary, the quaternary, the septenary and the duodena ry. Its hieroglyphic figures are analo- gous to those of the Book of Hermes or th e Genesis of Enoch, to make use of a tentative title which expresses merely the p ersonal opinion of the erudite William Postel. The cherub, or symbolic bull, which Mo ses placed at the gate of the Edenic world, bearing a fiery sword, is a sphinx, having a bull's body and a human head; it is the antique Assyrian sphinx, and the combat and vi ctory of Mithras were its hieroglyphic analysis. Now, this armed sphinx represents the Law of Mystery which watches at the door of initiation to warn away the profane. Voltaire, who knew nothing of all this, was highly divert ed at the notion of a bull brandishing a sword. What would he have said had he visited the ruins of Memphis and Thebes, and what would the echo of past ages which slumbers in the tombs of Rameses have replied to those light sarcasms so much relished in France? The Mosaic cherub represents also the Great Magica l Mystery, of which the elements are expressed by the septenary, without, however, givi ng the final word. This verbum inenarrabile of the sages of the Alexandrian school, this word which Hebrew Kabalists write 111 and interpret by ARARITA thus ex pressing the triplicity of the secondary principle, the dua lism of means, the equal uni ty of the first and final principle, the alliance between the triad and the tetrad in a word composed of four letters, which form sev en by means of a triple and double repetition – this word is pronounced ARARITA. The virtue of the septenary is absolute in Magic, for this number is decisive in all things: hence all religions have consecra ted it in their rite s. The seventh year was a jubilee among the Jews; the sevent h day is set apart for rest and prayer; there are seven sacraments, etc. The seven colours of the prism and the seven musical notes correspond also to the seven planets of the ancien ts, that is, to the seven chords of the human lyre. The sp iritual heaven has never changed, and astrology has been more invariable than astr onomy. The seven planets are, in fact, the hieroglyphic symbols of the keyboard of our affectio ns.

The blood, fat, liver and gall of these animals serve in enchantments; their brain combines with the perfumes of the planets, and it is recognized by an cient practice that they pos- sess magnetic virtues corresponding to the seven planetary influences. The talismans of the seven spirits are engraved either on precious stones, such as the carbuncle, crystal, diamond, eme rald, agate, sapphire and onyx, or upon metals, such as gold, silver, iron, copp er, fixed mercury, pewter and lead. The kabalistic signs of the seve n spirits are: for the Sun, a serpent with the head of a lion; for the Moon, a globe divided by two crescents; fo r Mars, a dragon biting the hilt of a sword; for Venus, a lingam; for Mercury, the Hermetic caduceus and the cynocephalus; for Jupiter, the Blazing Pentagr am in the talons or beak of an eagle; for Saturn, a lame and aged man, or a s erpent curled about the sun-stone. All these symbols are found on engraved stones of the ancients and especially on those talismans of the Gnostic epoc hs which are known by the name of ABRAXAS.

Man understands that he was made in the image of God when he attains comprehension of God by increasing to infinity the idea which he forms of himself. When realizing God as the infinite man, man says unto himself: I am the finite God. Magi c differs from mysticism because it judges nothing a pri- ori until after it has established a posteriori the actual base of its judgements, that is to say, after having apprehended th e cause by the effects contained in the energy of the cause itself, by means of the unive rsal law of analogy. Hence in the occult sciences all is real, an d theories are established only on the foundations of experience. Realities alone constitute the proportions of the ideal, and the Magus admits nothing as certain in the domain of ideas save that which is demonstrated by realization. In other word s, what is true in the ca use manifests in the effect. What is not realized does not exist. The realization of speech is the logos prop erly so called. A thought is realized in becoming speech; it is realized also by signs, sounds and representations of signs: here is the first degree of re alization. Then it is impr inted on the Astral Light by means of the signs of writ ing or speech; it influenc es other minds by reflections upon them; it is refrac ted by crossing the D IAPHANE of other men; it assumes new forms and proportions; it is translated into acts and modifies the world: this is the last degree of realization. Men who are bo rn into a world modified by an idea bear away with them the mark thereof, and it is thus that the word is made flesh. The mark of the disobedience of Adam, preserv ed in the Astral Li ght, could be effaced only by the stronger mark of the obedie nce of the Saviour, and thus the original sin and redemption of the world can be explained in a natural and magical sense. The Astral Light, or Soul of the World, was the inst rument of Adam's omnipo- tence; it became afterwards that of his punishment, being corrupted and troubled by his sin, which interming led an impure reflection wi th those primitive images which composed the Book of Universal Sc ience for his still virgin imagination. The Astral Light, depicted in ancient symbols by the serpent devouring its tail, represents alternately ma lice and prudence, time an d eternity, tempter and Redeemer; for this light, being the vehicle of life, is an auxiliary alike of good and evil, and may be taken not only for the fiery form of Satan but for the body of the Holy Ghost.

It may be compared to a horse having a nature analogous to the chameleon, ever reflecting the armour of his rider. The Astral Ligh t is the realization or form of intellectual light, as the latter is the realization or form of the Divine Light. The Great Initiator of Christianity, se eing that the Astral Light was over- charged with the impure reflections of Ro man debauchery, sought to separate His disciples from the circumambient sphere of reflections and to concentrate them only on the interior light, so that, through the medium of a common faith and enthusiasm, they might communicate toge ther by new magnetic chains, which He termed grace, and thus overcome the diss olute currents, to which He gave the names of the devil and Satan, signifying their putrefaction. To oppose current to current is to renew the power of fluidi c life. The revealers have therefore done scarcely more than divine, by the accuracy of their calculations, the appropriate moment for moral reactions. The law of re alization produces what we call mag- netic breathing; places and objects b ecome impregnated therewith, and this imparts to them an influence in conformity with our dominant desires, with those above all which are confirmed and realized by acts. As a fact, the Universal Agent, or latent Astral Light, ev er seeks equilibrium; it fill s the void and draws in the plenitude, which makes vice contagious, li ke certain physical maladies, and works powerfully in the proselytism of virtue. He nce it is that cohabitation with antipa- thetic beings is a torment; hence it is that relics, whether of sain ts or of great crim- inals, produce extraordinary results in sudden conversion and perversion; hence it is that sexual love is often awakened by a breath or a touch, and this not only by means of contact with the person himself, but with objects which he has uncon- sciously touched or magnetized. There is an outbreathing and inbreathing of the soul, exactly like that of the body. Whatsoever it regards as felicity, th at it inhales, and it breathes forth ideas which result from its inner sensations. Diseased souls have an evil breath and viti- ate their moral atmosphere – that is, they comb ine impure reflections with the Astral Light which permeat es them and establish unwholesome currents therein. We are often assailed, to our astonishment, in society by evil thoughts which would have seemed antecedently impossible and are not aware that they are due to some morbid proximity. This secret is of high importance, for it leads to the unveiling of consciences, on e of the most incontestib le and terrible powers of Magical Art. Magnetic respiration produ ces about the soul a radiation of which it is the centre, and thus surr ounds it with the reflection of its own works, creating for it a heaven or hell. Ther e are no isolated acts, and it is impossible that there should be secret acts; what soever we will truly, that is, everything which we con- firm by our acts, remains registered in the Astral Light, wh ere our reflections are preserved.

The Astral Light, transformed at the moment of conception into human light, is the soul's first envelope, and, in co mbination with extremely subtle fluids, it forms the Ethereal Body or Sidereal Ph antom, of which Pa racelsus discourses in his philosophy of intuition – philosophia sagax . This sidereal body, being liberated at death, attrac ts and for a long time pre- serves, through the sympathy of things homogeneous, the refl ections of the past life; if drawn into a special current by a will which is powerfully sympathetic, it manifests naturally, for there is nothing mo re natural than prodigies. It is thus apparitions are produced. But we shall develop this poin t more fully in a chapter devoted to Necromancy. The fluidic body , subject, like th e mass of the Astral Light, to two contrary mov ements, attracting on the left and repelling on the right, or reciprocally, between the two sex es, begets various impulses within us, and contributes to solicitudes of conscience; it is influenced frequently by reflec- tions of other minds, and thus temptations are produced on the one hand, and on the other profound and unexp ected graces. The traditiona l doctrine of two angels who sustain and tempt us is explained in this manner. The two forces of the Astral Light may be represented by a balance wherein are weighed our good intentions for the triumph of justice and th e emancipation of our liberty. The Astral Body is not always of the same sex as the terrestrial, that is, the pro- portions of the two forces, varying from ri ght to left, seem frequently to belie the visible organization, producing seeming aberrations of human passion and explaining, while in no wi se morally justifying, the amorous peculiarities of Ana- creon or Sappho. A skilful magnetizer should take all these subt le distinctions into account, and we sh all provide in our “Ritual” the rules for their recognition. There are two kinds of realization, the tr ue and the fantastic. The first is the exclusive secret of magicians, the ot her belongs to enchanters and sorcerers. Mythologies are fantastic real izations of religious dogma; superstitions are the sor- cery of mistaken piety; but even myth ologies and superstitions are more effica- cious on human will than a purely sp eculative philosophy apart from any practice. Hence St. Paul o pposes the conquests of the fo lly of the Cross to the inertness of human wisdom. Religion realizes philosophy by adapting it to the weaknesses of the vulgar; su ch is for Kabalists the secr et reason and occult expla- nation of the doctrines of incarnation and redemption. Thoughts untranslated into speech are thoughts lost for humanity; words unconfirmed by acts are idle words, and the idle word is not far removed from falsehood. Thought formulated by speech and confirmed by acts constitutes a good work or a crime. Hence, whether in vi ce or virtue, there is no utterance for which we are not responsible; above all, there are no indifferent acts.

When that emperor whose images had been mutilated, raising his hand to his face, exclaimed, “I do not feel that I am injured,” he was mistaken in his valuation and detracted thereby from the merit of his clemency. What man of honour could behold undisturbed an insult offered to his portrait? And did such insults, infl icted even unknown to oursel ves, react on us by a fatal influence, were the effects of bew itchment actual, as indeed an adept cannot doubt, how much more impr udent and ill-advised woul d seem this utterance of the good emperor! There are persons whom we can never of fend with impunity, and if the injury we have done them is mo rtal, we begin forthwith to die. There are those also whom we never meet in vain, whose mere glance alters th e direction of our life. The basilisk who slays by a look is no fa ble; it is a magica l allegory. Generally speaking, it is bad for health to have enemies, and we can never brave with impu- nity the reprobation of anyone. Before o pposing ourselves to a given force or cur- rent, we must be well assu red that we possess the contra ry force, or are with the stream of the contrary curr ent; otherwise, we shall be crushed or struck down, and many sudden deaths have no other caus e than this. The terrible visitations of Nadab and Abihu, of Osa, of Ananias a nd Sapphira, were occa sioned by electric currents of outraged conv ictions; the sufferings of the Ursulines of Loudun, the nuns of Louviers and the convulsionaries of Jansenism, were identical in principle and are explicable by the same occult na tural laws. Had not Urban Grandier been immolated, one of two things would have occurred: eith er the possessed nuns would have died in fright ful convulsions or the pheno mena of diabolical frenzy would have so gained in strength and in fluence, epidemically, that Grandier, not- withstanding his knowledge and his reason , would also have become hallucinated, and to such a degree that he would h ave denounced himself , like the unhappy Gaufridy, or would otherwise have perished suddenly, wi th all the appalling char- acteristics of poisoning or of divine vengeance. In the eighteenth century the unfortunate poet Gilbert fell a victim to his audacity in braving the current of opinion and even of philosophical fana ticism which charac terized his epoch. Guilty of philosophical treason, he died raving mad, possessed by the most incredible terrors, as if God Himself ha d punished him for defending His cause out of season. As a fa ct, he perished by reason of a law of Nature of which assur- edly he knew nothing; he set himself against an electric current and was struck down as by lightning.

We may recall the premature and violent end of many illustrious persons whom it would be in expedient to mention here. The brandings of public opinion may be often great injustices, but none the less they condemn their vict ims to failure and are ofte n a death-sentence. On the other hand, acts of injustice done to a single individual can and should, if unatoned, cause the ruin of an entire nation or of a whol e society: this is what is called the cry of blood, for at the root of every injustice there is the germ of homi- cide. By reason of these te rrible laws of solidarity, Christianity recommends so strongly the forgiveness of injuries and reconciliation. He who dies unforgiving casts himself dagger-armed in to eternity and condemns himself to the horrors of an eternal murder. The efficacy of patern al or maternal bles sings or curses is an invincible popular tradition and belief. As a fact, the closer the bonds which unite two persons, the more terrible are the con sequences of hatred between them.

Th e lamp of Trismegistus is reason illumi- nated by science; the mantle of Apollonius is full and complete self-possession, which isolates the sage from blind tendencies; and the staf f of the patriarchs is the help of the secret and everlasting for ces of Nature. The la mp of Trismegistus enlightens present, past and future, lays bare the conscience of men and manifests the inmost recesses of the female heart. Th e lamp burns with a triple flame, the mantle is thrice-folded and the st aff is divided into three parts. The number nine is that of divine reflections; it expres ses the divine idea in all its abstract power, but it signifies also extr avagance in belief, and hence supersti- tion and idolatry. For this reason He rmes made it the number of initiation, because the initiate reigns over superst ition and by superst ition: he alone can advance through the darkness, leaning on his staff, enveloped in his mantle and lighted by his lamp. Reason has been give n to all men, but all do not know how to make use of it: it is a scie nce to be acquired. Liberty is offered to all, but not all can be free: it is a right th at must be earned. Force is for all, but all do not know how to rest upon it: it is a power that must be won. We attain nothing without more than one effort. The destiny of man is to be enriched by his own earning and afterwards to have, like God, the gl ory and pleasure of dispensing it. Magic was called formerly th e Sacerdotal Art and the R oyal Art, because initia- tion gave empire over souls to the sage and the capacity for ruling wills. Divina- tion is also one of the privileges of th e initiate; now, divination is simply the knowledge of effects contained in causes and science applied to the facts of the universal dogma of analogy. Human acts are not written in the Astral Light alone; their traces are left upon the face, they modify mien and carriage, they change the tone of the voice. Thus every man bears ab out him the history of his life, which is legible for the initiate. Now, the future is ever the consequence of the past, and unexpected circumstances do not appreciably alter results reasonably calculated. The destiny of each man can be therefore foretold him. An entire existence may be judged by a single movement; a single oddity or weakne ss may be the presage of a long chain of misfortunes.

Initiation is a preservative against the false lights of mysticism; it equips human reason with its relative value and proportional infallibility, connecting it with supreme reason by the chain of analogies.

For him, therefore, to dare is to be able. Here, then, is a new interpretation of his attributes: his lamp represents learning; the mantle which en wraps him, his dis- cretion; while his staff is the emblem of his strength and boldness. He knows, he dares and is silent. He knows the secrets of the future, he dares in the present, and he is silent on the past. He knows the failings of th e human heart; he dares make use of them to achieve his work; and he is silent as to his pu rposes. He knows the significance of all symbolisms and of all re ligions; he dares to practise or abstain from them without hypocrisy and without im piety; and he is silent upon the one dogma of supreme initiation.

So may you find him often melancholy, never dejected or despairing; often poor, never abject or miserable; persecut ed often, never disheartened or con- quered. He remembers the bereavement and murder of Orpheus, the exile and lonely death of Moses, the martyrdom of the prophets, the tortures of Apollonius, the Cross of the Saviour. He knows the desolation in which Agrippa died, whose memory is even now slandered; he kno ws what labours overcame the great Paracelsus, and all that R aymond Lully was condemned to undergo that he might finish by a violent deat h. He remembers Swedenborg simulating madness and even losing reason in order to excuse hi s science; Saint-Martin and his hidden life; Cagliostro, who perished fo rsaken in the cells of th e Inquisition; Cazotte, who ascended the scaffold.

Simplified and vulgar- ized in later days, its symb ols furnished letters to the ar t of writing, characters to the Word, and to occult philosophy its my sterious signs and pant acles. This book, attributed by the Hebrews to Enoch, seventh master of the world after Adam; by the Egyptians to Hermes Trismegistus; by the Greeks to Cadmus, the mysterious builder of the Holy City: this book was the symbolical summary of primitive tra- dition, called subsequently Kabalah or Cabala, meaning reception. The tradition in question rests altogether on the one dogm a of Magic: the visi ble is for us the proportional measure of th e invisible. Now the ancien ts, observing that equilib- rium is the universal law in physics, and is consequent on the apparent opposition of two forces, argued from physical to metaphysical equilibrium, and maintained that in God, that is, in the First Livi ng and Active Cause, there must be recog- nized two properties which are necessary one to another – stability and motion, necessity and liberty, rational order an d volitional autonomy, justice and love, whence also severity and mercy. And these two attributes were personified, so to speak, by the kabalistic Jews under the names of G EBURAH and C HESED . Above G EBURAH and C HESED abides the Supreme Crown, the equilibrating power, prin- ciple of the world or equi librated kingdom, which we find mentioned under the name of M ALKUTH in the occult and kaba listic versicle of the Paternoster to which we have already referred.

In their abstract or idea lized sense, they take the higher names of C HOKMAH , Wis- dom, and B INAH , Intelligence. Their realization is stability and progress, that is, eternity and victory – H OD and N ETSAH . Such, according to the Kabalah, is the groundwork of all religions and all sci- ences – a triple triangle a nd a circle, the notion of th e triad explained by the bal- ance multiplied by itself in the domains of the ideal, then the realization of this conception in forms. Now, the ancients attached the first notions of this simple and impressive theology to the very idea of numbers, and qua lified the figure of the first decade after the following manner: 1.

G EBURAH .-Severity, necessitated by Wisdom itself, and by goodwill. To per- mit evil is to hinder good. 6. T IPHERETH .-Beauty, the luminous conception of equilibrium in forms, inter- mediary between the Crown and the Kingdom, mediating principle between Cre- ator and creation – a sublim e conception of poetry a nd its sovereign priesthood! 7. N ETSAH . - Victory, that is, eternal triu mph of intelligence and justice. 8. H OD .-Eternity of the conquests achieved by mind over matter, active over passive, life over death. 9. J ESOD . The Foundation, that is, the basis of all belief and al l truth otherwise, the A BSOLUTE in philosophy. 10. M ALKUTH .-The Kingdom, meaning the univ erse, entire creation, the work and mirror of God, the proof of supr eme reason, the formal consequence which compels us to have recourse to virtual pr emises, the enigma which has God for its answer – that is to say, Supreme and Absolute Reason. These ten primary notions attached to th e ten first characters of the primitive alphabet, signifying bo th principles and numbers, are called the ten S EPHIROTH by the masters in Kabalah. The Sacred Tetragram, drawn in the following man- ner, indicates the number, source and correspondence of Divine Names. To this name of J OTCHAVAH , written by these four-and-twenty signs, crowned with a triple flower of light, must be referred th e twenty-four thrones of heaven and the twenty-four crowned elders in the Apocalyp se. In the Kabalah th e occult principle is called the Ancient, and this principle, multiplied and, as it were, reflected in secondary causes, creates image s of itself – that is to say, so many Ancients as there are diverse conceptions of its unique essence. These image s, less perfect in proportion as they are re moved farther from their so urce, project upon the dark- ness an ultimate reflection or glimmer , representing a horrible and deformed Ancient, who is termed vulgar ly the devil. Hence an in itiate has been bold enough to say: “The devil is God, as understood by the wicked”; while another has added, in words more bizarre but no less ener getic: “The devil is composed of God's ruins.” We may sum up and ex plain these strikingly nove l definitions by remark-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE KABALAH 47 ing that in symbolism itself the demon is an angel cast out of heaven for having sought to usurp divinity. This belongs to the allegorical language of prophets and makers of legends. Philosophica lly speaking, the devil is a human idea of divinity, which has been surpassed an d dispossessed of heaven by the progress of science and reason. Among primitive Oriental pe oples, Moloch, Adra melek, Baal, were personifications of the one God, dishon oured by barbarous attributes. The god of the Jansenists, creating hell for the majo rity of human beings and delighting in the eternal tortures of tho se he was unwilling to save, is a conception even more barbarous than that of Molo ch: hence the god of the Jan senists is already a verita- ble Satan, fallen from heaven, in the sight of every wise and enlightened Chris- tian. In the multiplication of the Divine Names the Kabalists have connected them all, either with the unity of the Tetragram, the figure of the triad, or the sephirotic scale of the decad. They arrange the sca le of the Divine Names and numbers in a triangle, which may be presented in Roman characters as follows: J JA SDI JEHV ELOIM SABAOT ARARITA ELVEDAAT ELIM GIBOR ELIM SABAOT The sum of all these Divine Names for med from the one Tetragram, but outside the Tetragram itself, is a basis of the Hebrew Ritual and constitutes the occult force which the kabalistic rabbi ns invoke under the title of Shemhamphoras. We have now to concern ourselves with the Tarot from the kabalistic point of view, and have already indicated the occult source of the name. This hieroglyphic book is composed of a kabalistic alphabet and of a wheel or circle of four decades, distinguished by four symbol ical and typical figures, ea ch having for its radius a scale of four progressive figures, which represent Humanity: man, woman, youth, child – master, mistress, knight, esquire. The twenty-two figures of the alphabet represent, in the first place, the thirteen dogmas, and secondly, the nine beliefs authorized by that Jewish religion which is so strong and so firmly established on highest reason. Here follows the religious and kabalistic key of The Tarot, formulated in tech- nical verses after the mode of the ancient lawgivers:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"48 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic 1 ' A Conscious, Active Cause in all we see, 2 h And number proves the living unity. 3 g No bound hath He who doth the whole contain, 4 o But, all preceding, fills life's vast domain. 5 x Sole worthy worship, He, the only Lord, 6 n Doth His true doctrine to clean hearts accord. 7 z But since faith's works a single pontiff need, 8 k One law have we, and at one altar plead; 9 t Eternal God for aye their base upholds. 10 v Heaven and man's day alike His rule enfolds. 11 [ In mercy rich, in retribution strong, 12 s His people's King He will upraise ere long. 13 a The tomb gives entrance to the promised land, Death only ends; life's vistas still expand.

Figure II, vulgarly called Pope Joan , represents dogmatic unity based upon numbers, and is the personification of the Kabalah or the Gnosis. Figure III represents Divine Spir- ituality under the emblem of a winged woman, holding in one hand the apocalyp- tic eagle, and in the other the world suspended from th e end of her sceptre. The other emblems are equally clear, and can be explained as easily as the first.

Thus, the Club is the Egyptian Phallus or Hebrew J OD ; the Cup is the cteis or primitive H E ; the Sword is the conjunction of both, or the lingam, represented in Hebrew pre- ceding the captivity by Vau wh ile the Circle or Pantacle, image of the world, is the H E final of the Divine Name. Now let us ta ke a Tarot and comb ine all its emblems one by one into the Wheel or Rota of William Postel; let us group the four aces, the four twos, and so on, together; we sh all then have ten packs of cards giving the hieroglyphic interpretation of the triang le of Divine Names on the scale of the denary, as previously tabulated. By re ferring each number to its corresponding SEPHIRA, we may then read them off as follows: xnxv Four signs present th e Name of every name. 1 K ETHER . The four Aces. Four brilliant beams ad orn His crown of flame. 2 C HOKMAH . The four Twos. Four rivers ever from His wisdom flow. 3 B INAH . The four Threes. Four proofs of His intelligence we know. 4 C HESED .

By this simple arrangement the kabalist ic meaning of each card is exhibited. For example, the five of Clubs signifies rigorously G EBURAH of J OD , that is, the justice of the Creator or th e wrath of man; the seven of Cups signifies the victory of mercy or the triumph of woman; the eigh t of Swords signifies conflict or eternal equilibrium; and so of the others. We can thus understand how the ancient pon- tiffs proceeded to make the oracle speak. The chance dealing of the laminae pro- duced invariably a fresh kabalistic meani ng, exactly true in its combinations, which alone were fortuitous; and, seeing that the faith of the ancients attributed nothing to chance, they read the answers of Providence in the oracles of the Tarot, which were called T HERAPH or T HERAPHIM by the Hebrews, as the erudite Kaba- list Gaffarel, one of the magicians employed by Cardin al Richelieu, was the first to perceive. As to the Court-cards, a final co uplet will suffic e to explain them: K ING , Q UEEN , K NIGHT , E SQUIRE . The married pair, the youth , the child, the race; Thy path by these to Unity retrace.

The rabbins also divided the Kabalah into B ERESHITH , or universal Genesis, and M ERCAVAH , or the Chariot of Ezekiel; then by means of a dual interpretation of th e kabalistic alphabets, they formed two sciences, called G EMATRIA and T EMURAH , and so composed the Notary Art, which is fundamentally the co mplete science of the Tarot signs and their complex and varied application to th e divination of all secrets, whether of philosophy, Nature or the future itself. We shall recur to this work in the twentieth chapter of our “Ritual”."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"52 XI [ K THE MAGIC CHAIN MANUS FORCE T HE G REAT Magical Agent, by us termed the Astr al Light, by others the soul of the earth, and designated by old chemists under the names of Azoth and M AGNESIA , this occult, unique and indubita ble force, is the key of all empire, the secret of all power. It is the winged dr agon of Medea, the serpent of the Edenic Mystery; it is the universal glass of visions, the bond of sympathies, th e source of love, prophecy and glory. To know how to make use of th is Agent is to be the trustee of God's own power; all real, effective Magic, all occult forc e is there, and its demonstra- tion is the sole end of all genuine books of science. To have control of the Great Magical Agent there are two operations ne cessary – to concentrate and project, or, in other words, to fix a nd to move. Fixity has been provided as the basis and guarantee of movement by th e Author of all things: th e Magus must go to work in like manner. It is said that enthusiasm is contagi ous – and why? Because it cannot be pro- duced in the absence of rooted faith. Faith produces faith; to believe is to have a reason for willing; to will with reason is to will with power – I do not say with an infinite but with an indefinite power. What operates in the intellectual and moral world obtains still more in the physical, and when Archimedes was in want of a lever to move the world, he was seeking simply the Great Magical Arcanum. One arm of the androgyne figure of Henry Khunrath bore the word C OAGULA and the other S OLVE . To collect and diffuse are Nature's two words – but after what man- ner can we accomplish these operations on the Astral Li ght or soul of the world? Concentration is by isolation and distribut ion by the magical chain. Isolation con- sists in absolute independen ce of thought, complete li berty of the heart and per- fect continence of the senses . Every man who is obsesse d by prejudices and fears, every passionate person who is slave of his passions, is incapable of concentrating or coagulating, according to the expression of Khunrath, the As tral Light or soul of the earth. All true adepts have been independent even amidst torture, sober and chaste unto death. The explanation of such anomaly is this: in order to dis- pose of a force, you must not be surprise d by this force in a way that it may dis- pose of you. But then, will exclaim those who seek only in Magic for a method of inordinately satisfying the lusts of nature: “Of what avai l is power which must not be used for our own satisfaction?” Unhappy creatures who ask, if I told you, how should you understand? Are pearls nothing because th ey are worthless to the horde of Epicurus? Did not Curtius prefer the governme nt of those who had gold rather than its possession by himself?

Moreover, I grieve to deject or discourage you, but I am not inventing th e transcendental sciences: I teach them, defining their immutable ne cessities in the presentation of their primary and most inexorable conditions. Pythagoras was a fr ee, sober and chaste man; Apollonius of Tyana and Julius Caesar were both of re pellent austerity; the sex of Paracelsus was suspected, so foreign was he to th e weakness of love; Raymond Lully carried the severities of life to th e most exalted point of asce ticism; Jerome Cardan exag- gerated the practice of fast ing till he nearly perished of starvation, if we may accept tradition; Agrippa, poor and buffe ted from town to town, almost died of misery rather than yield to the caprice of a princess who insulted the liberty of sci- ence. What then made the happiness of these men? The knowledge of great secrets and the consciousness of power. It was sufficie nt for those exalted souls. Must one be like unto them in order to kn ow what they knew? Assuredly not, and the existence of this book is perhaps a case in point; but in order to do what they did, it is absolutely nec essary to take the means whic h they took. Yet what did they actually accomplish? They astonish ed and subdued the world; they reigned more truly than kings. M agic is an instrument of divine goodness or demoniac pride, but it is the annihila tion of earthly joys and th e pleasures of mortal life. Why study it? ask the luxuriou s. In all simplicity, to kn ow it, and possibly after to learn mistrust of stupi d unbelief or puerile credulity. Men of pleasure, and half of these I count for so many women, is not gratified curiosity highly pleasurable? Read therefore without fe ar, you will not be magici ans against your will. Readi- ness for absolute renunciation is, moreover, necessary only in order to establish universal currents and transform the face of the world; there are relative magical operations, limited to a certain circle, which do not need such heroic virtues. We can act upon passions by passions, dete rmine sympathies or antipathies, hurt even and heal, without pos sessing the omnipotence of the Magus. In this case, however, we must realize the risk of a reaction in proportion to the action, and to such risk we may fall easily a victim. All this will be explained in our “Ritual”. To make the Magic Chain is to estab lish a magnetic current which becomes stronger in proportion to the extent of th e chain. We shall see in the “Ritual” how such currents can be produced, and what are the various modes of forming the chain. Mesmer's trough was a chain of an exceedingly imp erfect kind; several great circles of illuminati in differen t northern countries possess others more potent. Even that association of Catholic priests, celebrated for their occult power and their unpopularity, is es tablished upon the plan an d follows the conditions of the most potent magical chains. Herein is the secret of thei r force, which they attri bute solely to the grace or will of God, a vulgar and easy solution for every mystery of power in influence or attraction. In the “Ritual” it will be our task to est imate the sequence of truly magical ceremonies and evocations which constitute the great work of vocation"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"54 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic under the name of the Exercises Of St. Ignatius. All enthusiasm propagated in a society by a scheme of inte rcourse and fixed practices in common produces a magnetic current, and is maintained or increased by the current. The action of the current is to transport and often to exalt beyond measure persons who are impressionable and weak, nervous organizations, tem- peraments inclined to hyst eria or hallucination. Such people soon become power- ful vehicles of magi cal force and project efficien tly the Astral Light in the direction of the current itself; opposition at such a time to the manifestations of the force is, to some extent, a struggle with fatality. When the youthful Pharisee Saul, or Schol, threw himself, with all th e fanaticism and all the obstinacy of a sectarian, across the line of advancing Christianity, he placed himself uncon- sciously at the mercy of a power against wh ich he thought to pr evail, and he was struck down by a formidabl e magnetic flash, doubtless the more instantaneous by reason of the combined effect of cereb ral congestion and sunstroke. The conver- sion of the young Isra elite, Alphonus of Ratisbon, is a contemporary fact which is absolutely of the same nature. We are ac quainted with a sect of enthusiasts whom it is common to deride at a distance, and to join, despite one's self, as soon as they are approached, even with a hostile inte ntion. I will go furt her and affirm that magical circles and magnetic currents establish themselves, and have an influ- ence, according to fatal laws, upon those on whom they can act. Each one of us is drawn within a sphere of relations whic h constitutes his world and to the influ- ence of which he is made subject. The lawgiver of the French Revolution, that man whom the most spiritual nation in the whole world acknowledged as the incarnation of human reason, Jean Jac ques Rousseau, was drawn into the most lamentable action of his life, the desertio n of his children, by the magnetic influ- ence of a libertine circle and a magical current of table-d'hote. He describes it sim- ply and ingenuously in his Confessions, but it is a fact which has remained unobserved. Great circles very often make great men, and vice versa. There are no unrecognized geniuses, there are eccentric men, and the term would seem to have been invented by an adept. The man who is eccentric in his genius is one who attempts to form a circle by combating the central attractive force of established chains and currents. It is his destiny to be broken or to succeed. Now, what is the twofold condition of success in such a case? A central point of stability and a per- sistent circular action of initiative. The man of genius is on e who has discovered a real law and is possessed thereby of an in vincible active and directing force. He may die in the midst of his work but th at which he has willed comes to pass in spite of his death, and is i ndeed often insured thereby, because death is a veritable assumption for genius. “Whe n I shall be lifted up from the earth,” said the great- est of the initiators, “I wi ll draw all men after me.” The law of magnetic currents is that of the movement of the Astral Light itself, which is always double and augments in a contrary direction.

Thus did Chateaubriand, penetrat ed with disgust at the Saturnalia of the Revolution, foresee and prepare the immense vogue of his Genius of Christianity. To o p p o s e one's self to a current at th e beginning of its career is to court being destroyed by that current, like the great and unfortu nate Emperor Julian; to oppose one's self to a current which has run its course is to take the lead of a contrary current. The great man is he who comes seasonably and knows how to innovate opportunely. In the days of the apostles, Voltaire wo uld have found no echo for his utterances, and might have been merely an ingenious parasite at the banquets of Trimalcyon. Now, at the epoch wherein we live, every thing is ripe for a fresh outburst of evangelical zeal and Christian self-devotion, precisely by reason of the prevailing general disillusion, egoistic positi vism and public cynicism of the coarsest interests. The success of certain books a nd the mystical tendencies of minds are unequivocal symptoms of this widespread disposition. We restore and we build churches only to realize more keenly that we are void of belief , only to long the more for it; once again does the whole wo rld await its Messiah, and he will not delay his advent. Let a ma n, for example, come forw ard, who by rank or by fortune is placed in an exal ted position – a pope, a king , even a Jewish millionaire – and let this man sacrifice publicly and so lemnly all his materi al interests for the weal of humanity; let him make himself the saviour of the poor, the promulgator and even the victim of doctrines of ren unciation and charity, and he will draw round him an immense followin g: he will accomplish a complete moral revolution in the world. But the high place is be fore all things necessary for such a personage, because, in the se days of meanness and trickery, any message issuing from the lower ranks is suspected of inte rested ambition and imposture. Ye, then, who are nothing, ye who pos sess nothing, aspire not to be apostles or messiahs. If you have faith, and would act in accordan ce therewith, get po ssession, in the first place, of the means of actio n, which are the influence of rank and the prestige of fortune. In olden times gol d was manufactured by sci ence; nowadays science must be renewed by gold. We have fixed the volatile and we must now volatilize the fixed – in other words, we have materialized spirit, an d we must now spiritualize matter. The most sublime ut terance passes unheeded if it goes forth without the guarantee of a name – that is to say, of a success which represents a material value. What is the worth of a manuscript ? That of the author's signature among the booksellers? The established reputati on known as Alexandre Dumas et Cie. represents one of the literary guarantees of our time. But the house of Dumas is in repute only for the romances which ar e its exclusive productions.

Hence to those who would say to me: If you po ssess the secret of gr eat successes and of a force which can transform the world, why do you not make use of them? I would answer: This knowledge has come to me t oo late for myself, and I have spent over its acquisition the time and the resources which might have enabled me to apply it; I offer it to those who are in a position to avail th emselves thereof. Illustrious men, rich men, great ones of this world, who are diss atisfied with that which you have, who are conscious of a nobler and la rger ambition, will you be fathers of a new world, kings of a rejuvenated civili zation? A poor and obscure scholar has found the lever of Archimed es, and he offers it to you for the good of humanity alone, asking nothing whatsoever in exchange. The phenomena which quite recently h ave perturbed America and Europe, those of table-turning and fl uidic manifestations, are si mply magnetic currents at the beginning of their formation, appeals on the part of Nature inviting us, for the good of humanity, to reconstitute great sympathetic and religious chains. As a fact, stagnation in the Astral Light wo uld mean destruction to the human race, and torpor in this Secret Agent has alre ady been manifested by alarming symp- toms of decomposition and death. For e xample, cholera-morbus, the potato dis- ease and the blight on the grape are tra ceable solely to this cause, as the two young shepherds of la Salette saw darkly and symbolically in their dream. The unlooked-for credit which awaited their narrative, and the vast co ncourse of pil- grims attracted by a statement so singul ar and at the same time so vague as that of these two children, without instruction and almost without morality, are proofs of the magnetic reality of the fact, and the fluidic tendency of the earth itself to operate the cure of its inhabitants. Supe rstitions are instinctive and all that is instinctive is founded in the very nature of things, to which fact the sceptics of all times have given insufficient attention. It follows that we attribute the strange phenomena of table-turning to the Universa l Magnetic Agent in search of a chain of enthusiasms with a view to the formation of fresh cu rrents.

Th e blows resounding on furniture, the clattering of dishes, the auto-playing of musical instruments, are illusions pro- duced by the same cause. The miracles of the convulsionaries of Saint Medard were of the same order, and seemed freque ntly to suspend the laws of Nature. On the one hand, exaggeration produced by fa scination, which is the special quality of delirium occasioned by co ngestions of the Astral Li ght; on the other, actual oscillations of movements impressed upon inert matter by the subtle and Univer- sal Agent of motion and life.

It has occurred to me frequently aft er experiments in the Magic Chain, per- formed with persons devoid of good inte ntion or sympathy, that I have been awakened with a start in the night by truly alarming impressions and sensations. On one such occasion I felt vividly th e pressure of an unknown hand attempting to strangle me. I rose up, lighted my lamp, and set calmly to work, seeking to profit by my wakefulness and to drive away the phant oms of sleep.

With cu riosity but also wi th tranquillity I observed all these phenom ena, which would not have been less wonderful had they been only the product of my imaginatio n, so real did they seem. For the rest, I may state that I was in no sense frightened, and during their occurrence I was engaged upon something quite foreign to the occult sciences.

This Agent disguise d by the ancient philoso phers under the name of the First Matter, determines the forms of mo difiable substance, and we can really arrive by means of it at metallic tran smutation and the Universal Medicine. This is not a hypothesis; it is a scientific fa ct already established and rigorously demon- strable. Nicholas Flamel and Raymond Lully, both of them poor, indubitably dis- tributed immense riches. Agrippa never pr oceeded beyond the fir st part of the Great Work, and he perished in the atte mpt, struggling to po ssess himself and to fix his independence. Now, there are two Hermetic operations, the one spiritual, the other material, and these are mutually dependent. For the rest, all Hermetic science is contained in the doctrine of Hermes, which is said to have been originally inscribed upon an emerald tablet. Its first ar ticles have been already expounded, and those follow which are concerned with the operation of the Great work: “Thou shalt separate the earth from the fi re, the subtle from the gross, gently, with great industry. It rises from eart h to heaven, and again it descends from heaven to earth, and it receiv es the power of things above and of things below. By this means shalt thou obtain the glory of the whole world, and all darkness shall depart from thee. It is th e strong power of every powe r, for it will overcome all that is subtle and penetrate all that is solid. Thus was the world created.” To separate the subtle from the gross, in the first operatio n, which is wholly inward, is to liberate the soul from al l prejudice and all vice, which is accom- plished by the use of Philosop hical Salt, that is to say, wisdom; of Mercury, that is, personal skill and application; finally, of Sulphur, representing vital energy and fire of will. By these are we enabled to change into spir itual gold things which are of all least precious, even the refuse of th e earth. In this sense we must interpret the parables of the choir of philosophers, Bernard Trev isan, Basil Valentine, Mary the Egyptian and other prophets of alchem y; but in their works, as in the Great Work, we must separate skillf ully the subtle from the gr oss, the mystical from the positive, allegory from theory.

When the masters in alchemy say that little time and money are needed to accomplish the works of sc ience, above all when they affirm that one vessel is alone needed, when they speak of the gr eat and unique Athanor which all can use, which is ready to each man's hand, wh ich all possess without knowing it, they allude to philosophical and moral alchemy. As a fact, the strong and resolute will can arrive in a short time at absolute independence, and we are all in possession of the chemical instrument, the great and sole Athanor which answers for the sep- aration of the subtle from the gross and the fixed from the volatile. This instru- ment, complete as the worl d and precise as mathematics, is represented by the sages under the emblem of the Pentagram or five-pointed star, which is the abso- lute sign of human intelligence. I will fo llow the example of the wise by forbearing to name it: it is too easy to divine. The Tarot symbol which corresponds to this chapter was misconstrued by Court de Gebelin and Etteilla, who regard ed it as the blunder of a German card- maker. It represents a man with his hands bound behind him, having two bags of money attached to the armpits, and susp ended by one foot fr om a gibbet formed by the trunks of two trees, ea ch with the stumps of si x lopped branches, and by a crosspiece, thus co mpleting the figure of the Hebrew T AU m . The legs of the victim are crossed, while his head and elbows form a triangle. Now, the triangle sur- mounted by a cross signifies in alchemy th e end and perfection of the Great Work, a meaning which is identica l with that of the letter T AU , the last of the sacred alphabet. This Hanged Man is, conseq uently, the adept, bound by his engage- ments and spiritualized, that is, having hi s feet turned toward s heaven.

Vulgarly, he is the traitor Judas, and hi s punishment is a menace to betrayers of the Great Arca num. Finally, for Kabalist ic Jews, the Hanged Man, who corresponds to their twel fth dogma, that of the prom ised Messiah, is a protes- tation against the Saviour ac knowledged by Christians, and they seem to say unto Him still: How canst Thou save others, sin ce Thou couldst no t save Thyself? In the Sepher-Toldos-Jeshu, an anti-Christian rabbinical compilation, there occurs a singular parable. Jeshu, says the rabbinical author of the legend, was travelling with Simon-Barjona and Judas Is cariot. Late and weary they came to a lonely house, and, being very hungry, coul d find nothing to ea t except an exceed- ingly lean gosling. It was in sufficient for three persons, and to divide it would be to sharpen without satisfying hunger. They agreed to dr aw lots, but as they were heavy with sleep: “Let us fi rst of all slumber,” said Jeshu, “whilst the supper is preparing; when we wake we will tell our dreams, and he who has had the most beautiful dream shall have the whole gos ling to his own share.” So it was arranged; they slept and they woke. “As fo r me,” said St. Peter, “I dreamed that I was the vicar of God.” “And I,” said Jes hu, “that I was God himself.” “For me,” said Judas hypocritically, “I dreamed th at, being in somnambul ism, I arose, went softly downstairs, took the gosling from th e spit, and ate it.” Thereupon they also went down, but the gosling had vanished altogether. Judas had a waking dream. This anecdote is given, not in the text of the Sepher-Toldos-Jeshu itself, but in the rabbinical commentaries on that work. The legend is a protest of Jewish posi- tivism against Christian mystic ism. As a fact, while the faithful surrendered them- selves to magnificent drea ms, the proscribed Israelite, Judas of the Christian civilization, worked, sold, intrigued, b ecame rich, possessed hi mself of this life's realities, till he became in a position to advance the means of existence to those very forms of worship which had so long outlawed him. Th e ancient worshippers of the ark remained true to the cultus of the strong-box; the Exchange is now their temple, and thence they govern the Christ ian world. The laugh is indeed with Judas, who can congratulate himself up on not having slep t like St. Peter. In archaic writings preceding the Captivity, the Hebrew T AU was cruciform, which confirms further our interpretation of the twelfth symbol of the Kabalistic Tarot. The Cross, which produces four tria ngles, is also the sacred sign of the duodenary, and on this account it was ca lled the Key of Heaven by the Egyptians. So Etteilla, confused by his protracted researches for the conciliation of the ana- logical necessities of this sy mbol with his own personal opinion, in which he was influenced by the erudite Court de Gebe lin, placed in the hand of his upright hanged man, by him interpreted as Prudence, a Hermetic caduceus, formed by two serpents and a Greek T AU . Seeing that he understood the necessity of the T AU or Cross on the twelfth leaf of the Book of Th oth, he should h ave seen also the manifold and magnificent meaning of th e Hermetic Hanged Man, the Prometheus of science, the living man who touches earth by his thought alone, whose firm"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"61 ground is heaven, the free and immolated adept, the revealer menaced with death, the conjuration of Judaism against Ch rist, which seems to be an involuntary admission of the secret divini ty of the Crucified, and la stly, the sign of the work accomplished, the cycle term inated, the intermediary T AU , which resumes for the first time, before the final denary , the signs of the sacred alphabet."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"62 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"63 XIII a N NECROMANCY EX IPSIS MORS W E HAVE said that the images of persons a nd things are preserved in the Astral Light. Therein also can be evoked the forms of those who are in our world no longer, and by this means are accomplis hed those mysteries of Necromancy which are so contested and at the same time so real. The Kabalists who have discoursed concerning the world of spirits have described simply what they have seen in their evocations. Eliphas Levi Zahed, who wr ites this book, has evoked, and he has seen. Let us state, in the fi rst place, what the masters h ave written on their visions or intuitions in that which they term th e light of glory. We read in the Hebrew book concerning the Revolution of Souls that there are three classes of souls – the daughters of Adam, the daug hters of angels and the da ughters of sin. According to the same work, there are also three kind s of spirits captive, wandering and free. Souls are sent forth in couples; at the same time certain souls of men are born widowed, for their spouses are held cap tive by Lilith and Naemah, queens of the stryges: they are souls condemned to ex piate the temerity of a celibate's vow. Hence, when a man renounces the love of women from his infancy, he makes the bride who was destined for him a slave to the demons of debauch. Souls grow and multiply in heaven, as bo dies do upon earth. Immaculate souls are the daughters of the kisses of angels. Nothing can enter heaven save that which comes from heaven. He nce, after death, the divi ne spirit which animated man ascends by itself above and leaves two corpses below, one upon earth, the other in the atmosphere; one terrestrial a nd elementary, the oth er aerial and side- real, one already inert, the other still animated by the universal movement of the soul of the world, yet destined to die sl owly, absorbed by the astral forces which produced it. The terrestrial body is visi ble; the other is un seen by the eyes of earthly and living bodies, nor can it be beheld except by the application of the Astral Light to the TRANSLUCID , which conveys its impressions to the nervous sys- tem and thus influences the organ of sight, so that it perceives the forms which are preserved and the words which are wr itten in the book of vital light. When a man has lived well the astral body evaporates like a pure incense ascending towards the superior regions; but should he h ave lived in sin, his astral body, which holds him prison er, still seeks the object of its passions and wishes to return to life. It torments the dreams of young girls, ba thes in the stream of spilt blood and floats about the pla ces where the pleasures of its life elapsed. It watches over treasures which it pos sessed and buried; it expends itself in painful efforts to make fresh material organs and so live again. But the stars dr aw it up and absorb"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"64 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic it; it feels its intelligence weaken, its memory gradually vanishes, all its being dis- solves . . . . Its former vices rise up before it, assume monstrous shapes and pursue it; they attack and devour it . . . . The unfortunate creature thus loses successively all the members which have ministered to his iniquities; then he dies a second time and for ever, because he loses his personality an d his memory. Souls which are destined to live, but are not yet purified completely, remain captive for a longer or shorter period in the astral body, wherein they are burned by the odic light, which seeks to absorb and dissolve them. It is in order to escape from this body that suffering souls sometimes ent er the organisms of the living and dwell therein in that stat e which Kabalists term embryonic. Now, it is these aerial bodies which are evoked by Necromancy. We en ter into communion with larvae, with dead or perishing substances, by this operation. The be ings in question, for the most part, cannot speak except by a ringin g in our ears produced by the nervous shock to which I have referred, and commo nly they can reason only by reflecting our thoughts and our reveries. To beho ld these strange for ms we must put our- selves in an abnormal condition akin to sleep or death; in other words, we must magnetize ourselves and ent er into a kind of lucid and waking somnambulism. Then Necromancy has real results, a nd the evocations of Magic can produce actual visions. We have sa id that in the Great Magica l Agent, which is the Astral Light, there are preserved all impressions of things, all images formed either by rays or reflections. In th is same light our dreams come to us; it is this which befools the insane and misguides their do rmant judgement in pursuit of the most bizarre phantoms. To insure vision without illusion in such light, a powerful will must help us to isolate refl ections and attract rays only . To dream awake is to see in the Astral Light, and th e orgies of the Sabbath, descri bed by so many sorcerers in their criminal trials, came to them sole ly in this manner. The preparations and the substances used to obtain this result were often horri ble, as we sh all see in the “Ritual”, but the result itself was never doubtful. They sa w, they heard, they han- dled the most abominable, most fantasti c, most impossible things., We shall return to this subject in our fifteenth chapter; at th e present moment we are con- cerned only with e vocation of the dead. In the spring of the year 1854 I had undertaken a journey to London, that I might escape from internal disquietude and devote myself, without interruption, to science. I had letters of introduction to persons of eminen ce who were anxious for revelations from the supernatural wo rld. I made the acquaintance of several and discovered in them, amid st much that was courteou s, a depth of indifference or trifling. They asked me forthwith to wo rk wonders, as if I were a charlatan, and I was somewhat discouraged, for, to speak frankly, far from being inclined to initiate others into the myst eries of Ceremonial Magic, I had shrunk all along from its illusions and weariness. Moreover, su ch ceremonies necessitated an equipment which would be expensive and hard to co llect. I buried myself therefore in the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"NECROMANCY 65 study of the transcendent Kabalah, and tr oubled no further about English adepts, when, returning one day to my hotel, I found a note awaiting me. This note con- tained half of a card, divided transversely, on which I recognized at once the seal of Solomon. It was accompanied by a sma ll sheet of paper, on which these words were pencilled: “Tomorrow, at three o'cl ock, in front of We stminster Abbey, the second half of this card will be given you.” I kept this curious assignation. At the appointed spot I found a carriage drawn up, and as I held unaffectedly the frag- ment of card in my hand, a footman appr oached, making a sign as he did so, and then opened the door of the equipage. It contained a lady in black, wearing a thick veil; she motioned to me to take a se at beside her, show ing me at the same time the other half of the card. The door closed, the carriage drove off, and the lady raising her veil I saw that my appo intment was with an elderly person, hav- ing grey eyebrows an d black eyes of unusual brillian ce, strangely fi xed in expres- sion. “Sir,” she began, with a strongly marked English accent, “I am aware that the law of secrecy is rigorous amongst adepts; a friend of Sir B---L--- who has seen you, knows that you have been asked for phenomena, and that you have refused to gratify such curiosity. You ar e possibly without the materials; I should like to show you a complete magical ca binet, but I must exact beforehand the most inviolable silence. If you will not give me this pledge upon your honour, I shall give orders for you to be driven to your hotel.” I made the required promise and keep it faithfully by not divulging th e name, position or abode of this lady, whom I soon recognized as an initiate, not exactly of the first order, but still of a most exalted grade. We had a number of long conversations, in the course of which she insisted always upon the necessity of practic al experience to complete initiation. She showed me a collection of magical vestments and instruments, lent me some rare books which I needed; in shor t, she determined me to attempt at her house the experiment of a complete evoc ation, for which I prepared during a period of twentyone days, scrupulously ob serving the rules laid down in the thir- teenth chapter of the “Ritual”. The preliminaries terminated on 2 nd July; it was proposed to evoke the phan- tom of the divine Apollonius and interr ogate it upon two secr ets, one which con- cerned myself and one which interested th e lady. She had count ed on taking part in the evocation with a trustworthy pers on, who, however, proved nervous at the last moment, and, as the triad or unity is indispensable for Magical Rites, I was left to my own resources. The cabinet prep ared for the evocation was situated in a turret; it contained four concave mirro rs and a species of altar having a white marble top, encircled by a chain of magnetized iron. The Sign of the Pentagram, as given in the fifth chapt er of this work, was graven an d gilded on the white mar- ble surface; it was inscribed also in various colours upon a new white lambskin stretched beneath the altar. In the middle of the marb le table there was a small 1 copper chafing-dish, containi ng charcoal of alder and laurel wood; another chaf-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"66 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic ing-dish was set before me on a tripod . I was clothed in a white garment, very similar to the alb of our ca tholic priests, but longer and wider, and I wore upon my head a crown of vervain leaves, intertwined with a golden chain. I held a new sword in one hand, and in the other the “Ritual”. I kindled tw o fires with the req- uisite prepared substances, and began reading the evocatio ns of the “Ritual” in a voice at first low, but rising by degrees. The smoke spread, the flame caused the objects upon which it fell to waver, then it went out, the smoke still floating white and slow about the marble al tar; I seemed to feel a quaki ng of the earth, my ears tingled, my heart beat quickly. I heaped more twigs and perfumes on the chaf- ing-dishes, and as the flame again burst up, I beheld distinctly, before the altar, the figure of a man of more than normal size, which dissolve d and vanished away. I recommenced the evocatio ns and placed myself with in a circle which I had drawn previously between th e tripod and the altar. Thereupon the mirror which was behind the altar seemed to brighten in its dept h, a wan form was outlined therein, which increased and seemed to approach by degrees. Three times, and with closed eyes, I invoked Apollonius . When I again looked forth there was a man in front of me, wrappe d from head to foot in a species of shroud, which seemed more grey than white. He was lean, melancholy and beardless, and did not altogether correspond to my preconceived notion of Apollonius. I experienced an abnormally cold sensation, and when I endeavoured to question the phantom I could not articulate a syllable. I theref ore placed my hand upon the Sign of the Pentagram, and pointed the sw ord at the figure, comma nding it mentally to obey and not alarm me, in virtue of the sa id sign. The form thereupon became vague, and suddenly disappeared. I directed it to return, and presently felt, as it were, a breath close by me; something touched my hand which was holding the sword, and the arm became immediately benumbed as far as the elbow. I divined that the sword displeased the spirit, and I theref ore placed it point downwards, close by me, within the circle. The human figure reappeared immediately, but I experi- enced such an intense wea kness in all my limbs, an d a swooning sensation came so quickly over me, that I ma de two steps to sit down, whereupon I fell into a pro- found lethargy, accompanied by dreams, of which I had only a confused recollec- tion when I came again to myself. For several subseque nt days my arm remained benumbed and painful. The apparition di d not speak to me, but it seemed that the questions I had designed to ask answ ered themselves in my mind. To that of the lady an interior voice replied – Deat h! – it was concerning a man about whom she desired information. As for myself, I sought to know whether reconciliation and forgiveness were possible between tw o persons who occupied my thoughts, and the same inexorable echo within me answered – Dead! I am stating facts as they occurred, bu t I would impose faith on no one. The consequence of this experience on mysel f must be called inexplicable. I was no longer the same man; something of anothe r world had passed into me; I was no"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"NECROMANCY 67 longer either sad or cheerful, but I felt a singular attraction towards death, unac- companied, however, by any suicidal te ndency. I analysed my experience care- fully, and, notwithstanding a lively nervous repugnance, I repeated the same experiment on two further occasions, allowing some d ays to elapse between each. There was not, however, sufficient diff erence between the phenomena to warrant me in protracting a narrativ e which is perhaps already too long. But the net result of these two additional evocations was for me the revelation of two kabalistic secrets which might change, in a short space of time, the foundations and laws of society at large, if they came to be known generally. Am I to conclude from all this that I really evoked, saw and touched the great Apollonius of Tyana? I am not so hallucin ated as to affirm or so unserious as to believe it. The effect of th e preparations, the perfumes, the mirrors, the pantacles, is an actual drunkenness of the imagination, which mu st act powerfully upon a person otherwise nervous and impression able. I do not explain the physical laws by which I saw and touched; I affirm sole ly that I did see and that I did touch, that I saw clearly and distin ctly, apart from dreaming, and this is sufficient to establish the real efficacy of magical ceremonies. For th e rest, I regard the practice as destructive and dangerous; if it b ecame habitual, neither moral nor physical health would be able to withstand it. The elderly lady whom I have mentioned, and of whom I had reason to complain subsequently, was a case in point. Despite her asseverations to the contrary, I have no doubt that she was addicted to Necro- mancy and Goetia. At times she talked complete nonsense, at others yielded to senseless fits of pass ion, for which it was difficult to discover a cause. I left Lon- don without bidding her adieu, and I adhe re faithfully to my engagement by giv- ing no clue to her identity, which might connect her name with practices, pursued in all probability without the knowledge of her family, which I believe to be numerous and of very honourable position. There are evocations of intelligence, evoc ations of love and evocations of hate; but, once more, there is no proof whatsoever that spirits leave the higher spheres to communicate with us: the opposite, as a fact is more probable. We evoke the memories which they have left in the As tral Light, or common reservoir of univer- sal magnetism. It was in this light th at the Emperor Julian once saw the gods manifest, looking old, ill and decrepit – a fresh proof of the influence exercised by current and accredited opinions on the reflections of this same Magical Agent, which makes our tables talk and answers by taps on the walls. After the evocation I have described, I re-read carefully the li fe of Apollonius, who is represented by historians as an ideal of antique be auty and elegance, and I remarked that towards the end of his life he was starve d and tortured in prison. This circum- stance, which remained perhaps in my memory without my being aware of it, may have determined the unattractive fo rm of my vision, the latter regarded solely as the voluntary dream of a waking man. I have seen two other persons,"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"68 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic whom there is no occasion to name, both differing, as regards costume and appearance, from what I ha d expected. For the rest, I commend the greatest cau- tion to all who propose undertaking simila r experiences: their result is intense exhaustion and frequently a shoc k sufficient to occasion illness. I must not conclude this chapter without mentioning the curious opinions of certain Kabalists, who dist inguish between apparent and real death, holding that the two are seldom simultaneo us. In their view, the majo rity of persons who are buried are still alive, while a number of ot hers who are regarded as living are in reality dead. Incurable madness, for exam ple, would be with them an incomplete but real death, leaving the earthly form under the purely instinctive control of the sidereal body. When the human soul suffers a greater strain than it can bear, it would thus become separated from the body, leaving the animal soul, or sidereal body, in its place, and these human remain s would be less aliv e in a sense than a mere animal. Dead persons of this kind ar e said to be identified by the complete extinction of the moral and affectionate sense: they are neither bad nor good; they are dead. Such beings, who are poisonous f ungi of the human race, absorb the life of living beings to their fullest possibl e extent, and this is why their proximity depletes the soul and chills the heart. If such corpse-l ike creatures really existed, they would stand for all that was reco unted in former tim es about brucalaques and vampires. Now, are there not certain persons in whose pr esence one feels less intelligent, less good, some times even less honest? Are there not some whose vicin- ity extinguishes all faith and all ent husiasm, who draw you by your weaknesses, who govern you by your evil propensities, and make you die slowly to morality in a torment like that of Mezentius? These ar e dead people whom we mistake for liv- ing beings; these are vampires whom we regard as friends!"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"69 XIV i O TRANSMUTATIONS SPHERA LUNAE SEMPITERNUM AUXILIUM S T . A UGUSTINE questioned seriously whether Apuleius could have been changed into an ass by a Thessalian sorceress, and theologians have long debated about the transformation of Nebuchadnezzar into a wild beast, which things merely prove that the eloquent do ctor of Hippo was unacquain ted with magi cal secrets and that the theologians in question were not advanced far in exegesis. We are concerned in this ch apter with different and more in credible marvels, which are at the same time incontestable. I refer to lyca nthropy, or the nocturnal transforma- tion of men into wolves, long celebrated in country tales of the twilight by the his- tories of werewolves. These accounts are so well attested that, wi th a view to their explanation, sceptical science has recou rse to furious mania and masquerading as animals. But such hypotheses are pueril e and account for nothing. Let us turn elsewhere for the secret of the phenomen a which have been observed on this sub- ject and begin with establishing ( 1 ) That no person has ever been killed by a were- wolf, except by suffocatio n, without effusion of blood and without wounds; ( 2 ) That werewolves, though tracked, pursued and even maimed, have never been killed on the spot; ( 3 ) That persons suspected of these transformations have always been found at home, after a werewolf chase, more or less broken up, some- times dying, but invariably in their natural form. Let us next establish phenome na of a different order. Nothing in the world is better borne out by evidence than the visible and real presence of P. Alphonsus Ligouri beside the dying pope, whilst th e same personage was simultaneously seen at home, far from Rome, in prayer and ecstasy. Further, the simultaneous pres- ence of the missionary Francis Xavier in several places at once has been no less strictly demonstrated. It w ill be said that these are miracles, but we reply that miracles when they are genui ne are simply facts for sci ence. Apparitions of per- sons dear to us coincidently with the mo ment of their death are phenomena of the same order and attributable to the same cause. We have spoken of the sidereal body, which is intermediary between the soul and the phy sical envelope. Now, this body frequently remains awake while th e latter sleeps, and passes in thought through all space which unive rsal magnetism opens before it. It lengthens without breaking the sympathetic chain which attach es it to our heart and brain, and it is for this reason that it is so dangerous to awaken dreamers suddenly. As a fact, too great a start may break the bond in an instant and cause immediate death. The form of our sidereal body is in correspo ndence with the habitu al condition of our thoughts, and it modifies, in the long run, the characteristics of the material body."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"70 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic That is why Swedenborg, in his somnambulistic intu itions, frequently beheld spirits in the shape of various animals. Let us now make bold to say that a werewolf is nothing else but the sidereal body of a man whose savage and sanguina ry instincts are typified by the wolf; who, further, whilst his phantom wanders over the country, is sleeping painfully in his bed and dreams that he is a wolf indeed. What makes the werewolf visible is the almost somnambulistic ex citement caused by the frig ht of those who behold it, or else the tendency, more particularly in simple country persons, to enter into direct communication with the Astral Light, which is the common medium of visions and dreams. The hurts inflicted on the werewolf do actually wound the sleeping person by an odic and sympatheti c congestion of the Astral Light, and by correspondence between the immaterial and material body. Many persons will believe that they are dreaming when they read such things as these, and may ask whether we are really awake ourselves; but we need only request men of science to reflect upon the phenomena of gestation and upon the in fluence of the imagina- tion of women on the form of their offspring. A woma n who had been present at the execution of a man who wa s broken on the wheel gave birth to a child with all its limbs shattered. Let anyone tell us ho w the impression pr oduced upon the soul of the mother by a horrible spectacle could so have re acted on the child, and we will explain in turn why blows received in dreams can bruise and even wound grievously the body of him wh o receives them in imagin ation, above all when that body is suffering and subjected to nervous and magnetic influences. To such phenomena and to the occult laws which govern them must be referred the effects of bewitchment, of which we shall speak hereafter. Diabolical obses- sions, and the majority of nervous di seases which affect the brain, are wounds inflicted on the nervous mechanism by perverted As tral Light, meaning that which is absorbed or proj ected in abnormal proportions. All extraordinary and extra-natural tensions of will predis pose to obsessions and nervous diseases; enforced celibacy, asceticism, hatred, ambi tion, rejected love, are so many genera- tive principles of infernal forms and influences. Parace lsus says that the menstru- ations of women beget phantoms in the air, and from this standpoint convents would be seminaries for nigh tmares, while the devils mi ght be compared to those heads of the hydra of Lerna which were reproduced eternally and propagated in the very blood from their wounds. The phenomena of possession amongst the Ursulines of Loudun, so fatal to Urban Grandier, have been misconstrued. The nuns in reality were possessed by hysteria and fanatica l imitation of the secret thoughts of their exorcists, these being tr ansmitted to their ne rvous system by the Astral Light. They experienced an impress ion of all the hatreds which this unfor- tunate priest had conjured up against hi m, and such wholly interior communica- tion seemed diabolical and miraculous to themselves. Hence in this tragical affair everyone acted sincerely, even to Laubard emont, who, in hi s blind execution of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"TRANSMUTATIONS 71 the prejudged verdicts of Cardinal Richel ieu, believed that he was fulfilling the duties of a true judge, and as little suspected himself of being a follow er of Pontius Pilate as he would have recognized in the sceptical and libertine cure of Saint-Pierre-du-March a disciple and mart yr of Christ. The possession of the nuns of Louvier is scarcely more than a copy of those of Loudun: devils invent little and plagiarize one another. The process of Ga ufridi and Magdalen de la Palud pos- sesses stranger features, for in this case the vict ims were their own accusers. Gaufridi confessed that he was guilty of depriving a number of women of the power to defend themselves against his seductions by si mply breathing in their nostrils. A young and beautiful girl, of noble family, who ha d been thus insuf- flated, described in the grea test detail scenes wherein lubricity seemed to vie with the monstrous and grotesque. Such are the or dinary hallucinations of false mysti- cism and infringed celibacy. Gaufridi and his mistress were obsessed by their mutual chimeras, and the brain of the on e reflected the nightmares of the other. Was not the Marquis de Sade himself infectious for cert ain depleted and diseased natures? The scandalous trial of Father Girard is a fresh proof of the deliriums of mysti- cism and the singular nervous affections which it may entail. The trances of la Cadiere, her ecstasies, her stigmata, were all as real as the insensate and perhaps involuntary debauchery of her director. She accused him when he wished to with- draw from her, and the conv ersion of this young woma n was a revenge, for there is nothing more cruel than depraved passion s. An influential society, which inter- vened in the trial of Grandi er for the destruction of th e possible heretic, in this case rescued Father Girard for the honour of the order. Moreover, Grandier and Girard attained the same results by very different means, wi th which we shall be concerned specially in the sixteenth chapter. We act by our imagination on the imagina tion of others, by our sidereal body on theirs, by our organs on their organs, in such a way that, through sympathy, whether of inclination or obsession, we possess one another reciprocally and iden- tify ourselves w ith those whom we wish to affect. Reactions against such domina- tions may cause the most pronounced antip athy to succeed the liveliest sympathy. Love has a tendency to unif y beings; in thus identify ing, it renders them rivals frequently, and hence enemies, if in the depth of the two natures there is some unsociable disposition like pride. To fill two united souls with pride in an equal degree is to disjoin them by making them rivals. Antagonism is the necessary con- sequence of a plurality of gods. When we dream of any living person, ei ther his sidereal bo dy presents itself to ours in the Astral Light or at least a reflection thereof, and our impressions at the meeting may often make kn own his secret dispositions in our regard. For exam- ple, love fashions the sidereal body of the one in the image and likeness of the other, so that the psychic medium of the woman is like a man and that of the man"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"72 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic like a woman. It was this transfer whic h the Kabalists sought to express in an occult manner when they said, in explanation of an obscure passage in Genesis: “God created love by placing a rib of Ad am in the breast of the woman and a por- tion of the flesh of Eve in the breast of the man, so th at at the bottom of woman's heart there is the bone of man, while at the bottom of man's heart there is the flesh of woman” – an alle gory which is certainly not devoid of depth and beauty. We have referred, in the previous chapte r, to what the masters in Kabalah call the embryonic condition of soul s. This state, completed after the death of the per- son who thereby possesses anot her, is commenced often in life, wheth er by obses- sion or by love. I knew a young woman whose parents inspired her with a great terror, and who began suddenl y to inflict upon an inof fensive person the very acts she dreaded in them. I knew another who, after participating in an evocation con- cerned with a guilty woma n suffering in the next wo rld for certain eccentric acts, began to imitate, without an y reason, the peculiarities of the dead person. To this occult influence must be attributed the te rrible power of a pare nt's curse, which is feared by all nations on earth, as also the imminent danger of magical operations when anyone has not reached the isolation of true adepts. This virtue of sidereal transmutation, which really exists in love , explains the allegorical marvels of the wand of Circe. Apuleius sp eaks of a Thessalian woman who changed herself into a bird; he won the affections of her servant to discover the secrets of the mistress, but succeeded only in transforming himself into an ass. This allegory contains the most hidden secrets of love. Again, the Kabalists say that when a man falls in love with a female elementary – undine, sylphide or gnomide, as the case may be – she becomes immortal with him, or otherwise he dies with her. We have seen already that elementaries are imperfect and as ye t mortal men. The revelation we have mentioned, which has been regarded merely as a fable, is therefore the dogma of moral solidarity in love, whic h is itself the foundation of love, explaining all its sanctity and all its power. Who then is this Circe, that changes her worshippers into swine, while, so soon as she is subjected to th e bond of love, her enchant- ments are destroyed? She is the ancient courtesan, the marble-hearted woman of all the ages. She who is wi thout love absorbs and degr ades all who approach her; she who loves, on the ot her hand, diffuses enth usiasm, nobility and life. There was much talk in the last centur y about an adept accused of charlatan- ism, who was termed in his lifetime the divine Cagliost ro. It is known that he practised evocations and that in this ar t he was surpassed only by the illuminated Schroepffer. It is said also that he boas ted of his power in binding sympathies, and that he claimed to be in possession of th e secret of the Great Work; but that which rendered him still more fa mous was a certain elixir of life, which immediately restored to the aged the strength and vitality of you th. The basis of this composi- tion was malvoisie wine, and it was obtain ed by distilling th e sperm of certain animals with the sap of certain plants. We are in possession of the recipe, but our reasons for withholding it will be understood readily."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"73 XV y P BLACK MAGIC SAMAEL AUXILIATOR W E APPROACH the mystery of Black Magic. We ar e about to confront, even in his own sanctuary, the black god of the Sa bbath, the formidable goat of Mendes. At this point those who are liable to fear sh ould close the book; even persons who are a prey to nervous impressions will do well to divert their atte ntion or to abstain. We have undertaken a task, and we must co mplete it. Let us first of all address ourselves frankly and boldly to the questions: Is there a devil? What is the devil? As to the first point, science is silent, philosophy denies it at hazard, religion only answers in the affirmative. As to the second point, religion states that the devil is the fallen angel; occult philosophy accepts and explains this de finition. It will be unnecessary to repeat what we have said previously on the subject, but we may add a further revelation: I N BLACK MAGIC , THE DEVIL IS THE GREAT MAGICAL AGENT EMPLOYED FOR EVIL PURPOSES BY A PERVERSE WILL . The old serpent of the legend is nothing el se than the Universal Agent, the eter- nal fire of terrestrial life, the soul of th e earth, and the living centre of hell. We have said that the Astral Light is the re ceptacle of forms, and these when evoked by reason are produced harmoniously, bu t when evoked by madness they appear disordered and monstrous: so originated the nightmares of St. Anthony and the phantoms of the Sabbath. Do therefore the evocations of goetia and demonoma- nia produce a practical result? Yes, certai nly – one which cannot be contested, one more terrible than could ev er be recounted in legends ! When anyone invokes the devil with intentional ceremonies, the de vil comes and is seen. To escape dying from horror at that sight, to escape ca talepsy or idiocy, one must be already mad. Grandier was a libertine through indevot ion and perhaps also through scepticism; excessive zeal, following on the aberrations of ascetic ism and blindness of faith, depraved Girard and made him deprave in his turn. In the fift eenth chapter of our “Ritual” we shall give all the diabolic al evocations and practices of “Black Magic,” not that they may be used, but that they may be known and judged, and that such insanities may be put aside for ever. M. Eudes de Mirville, whose book upon table-turning made a certain sensation recently, will be contented possibly and di scontented at the sa me time with the solution here given of Black Magic and its problems. As a fact , we maintain like himself the reality and prodigious nature of the facts; with him also we assign them to the old serpent, the occult prince of this world; but we are not agreed as to the nature of this bli nd agent, which, under different leadership, is the instru- ment of all good or of all evil, the minister of prophets or the inspirer of pytho-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"74 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic nesses. In a word, the devil, for us, is force placed te mporarily at the disposal of evil, even as mortal sin is, to our thinki ng, the persistence of the will in what is absurd. M. de Mirville is therefore a thou sand times right, but he is once and one great time wrong. Whatsoever is arbitrary must be exclud ed from the realm of things positive. Nothing happens by chance, nor yet by the autocracy of a good or evil will. There are two houses in heaven, a nd the tribunal of Satan is restrained in its extremes by the Senate of Divine Wisdom."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"75 XVI r Q BEWITCHMENTS FONS OCULUS FULGUR W HEN A MAN gazes unchastely upon any woman he profanes that woman, said the Great Master. What is willed with persistence is done. Every real will is confirmed by acts; every will confirmed by an act is an action. Every action is subject to a judgement, and such judgement is eternal . These are dogmas and principles from which it follows that the go od or evil which we will, to others as to ourselves, according to the capacity of our will an d within the sphere of our operation, must take place infallibly, if the will be co nfirmed and the determination fixed by acts. Such acts should be analogous to the will. The intent to do harm or to excite love, in order to be efficacious, must be confirmed by deed s of hatred or affection. Whatsoever bears the impression of a huma n soul belongs to that soul; whatso- ever a man has appropriated after any manner becomes his body in the broader acceptation of the term, and anything which is done to the body of a man is felt, mediately or immediately, by his soul. It is for this re ason that every hostile deed committed against one's neig hbour is regarded in mora l theology as the beginning of homicide. Bewi tchment is a homicide, and the mo re infamous because it eludes self defence by the victim and punishment by law. Th is principle being estab- lished to exonerate our conscience, and for the warning of weak vessels, let us affirm boldly that bewitchment is possibl e. Let us even go further and lay down that it is not only possible but in some sense necessary and fatal. It is going on continually in the social world, unconsci ously both to agents and patients. Invol- untary bewitchment is one of the most terrible dangers of human life. Passional sympathy inevitably subjects the most ar dent desire to the strongest will. Moral maladies are more contagious than physi cal, and there are some triumphs of infatuation and fashion which are comparab le to leprosy or ch oler. We may die of an evil acquaintance as well as of a contagious touch, and the frightful plague which, during recent centurie s only, has avenged in Euro pe the profanation of the mysteries of love, is a revelation of the analogical laws of Nature and at the same time offers only a feeble image of the mo ral corruptions which follow daily on an equivocal sympathy. There is a story of a jealous and infamous man who, to avenge himself on a rival contracted an incurable disorder and made it the com- mon scourge and anathema of a divided bed. This atro cious history is that of every magician, or rather of every sorc erer who practises bewitchments. He poi- sons himself in order that he may poison others; he damns himself that he may torture others; he draws in he ll with his breath in order that he may expel it by his lungs; he wounds hi mself mortally that he may in flict death on others; but pos-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"76 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic sessed of this unhappy courage , it is positive and certai n that he will poison and slay by the mere projection of his perverse will. Ther e are some forms of love which are as deadly as hatred, and the bewitchments of goodwill are the torment of the wicked. The prayers offered to Go d for the conversion of a man bring mis- fortune to that man if he will not repent. As we have said, it is weariness and dan- ger to strive against the fluid ic currents stirred up by chains of wills in union. Hence there are two kinds of bewitchment, voluntary and involuntary; physical and moral bewitchment may be distingu ished in like manne r. Power attracts power, life attracts life, health attracts he alth: this is a law of Nature. If two chil- dren live, above all if they sleep togeth er, and if one be weak while the other is strong, the strong will absorb the weak , and the latter will waste away. For this reason, it is important that children sh ould sleep always al one. In conventual seminaries certain pupils absorb the intellig ence of the others, and in every given circle of men one individual emerges who avails himself of the wills of the rest. Bewitchment by means of currents is ex ceedingly common, as we have observed already; morally as well as physically, most of us ar e carried away by the crowd. What, however, we have propo sed to exhibit more especia lly in this chapter is the almost absolute power of the human will upon the determination of its acts and the influence of every outward demonstr ation of will upon outward things. Voluntary bewitchments are still frequent in our rura l places because natural forces, among ignorant and isolated p ersons, operate unreduced by any doubt or any diversion. A frank, absolute hatred, unleavened by reject ed passion or per- sonal cupidity, is, under certain given conditi ons, a death-sentence for its object. I say unmixed with amorous passion or cupi dity, because a desire, being an attrac- tion, counterbalances and annuls the powe r of projection. For example, a jealous person will never efficaciously bewitch his rival, and a greedy heir will never by the mere fact of his will su cceed in shortening the days of a miserly and long-lived uncle. Bewitchments attemp ted under such conditions reflect upon the operator and help rather than hurt their object, se tting him free from a hostile action which destroys itself by unmeasured exaggeration. The term envoutement (bewitch- ment) so strong in its Ga elic simplicity, expresses ad mirably what it means, the act of enveloping someone, so to speak, in a formulated w ill. The instrument of bewitchments is the Great Magical Agent which, under the influence of an evil will, becomes really and posi tively the demon. Witchcra ft, properly so called, that is, ceremonial operation with intent to bewitch, acts only on the operator, and serves to fix and confirm his will, by formu lating it with persistence and travail, the two conditions which make volition efficacious. The more difficult or horrible the operation, the greater is its power, beca use it acts more st rongly on the imagi- nation and confirms effort in direct ratio of resistance.

Such are the practices which from all time have brou ght down upon sorcerers the just repres- sion of the laws. Black Magic is really only a graduated combination of sacrileges and murders designed for th e permanent perversion of a human will and for the realization in a living man of the hideous phantom of th e demon. It is therefore, properly speaking, the religio n of the devil, the cultus of darkness, hatred of good carried to the height of paroxysm: it is the incarnation of de ath and the persistent creation of hell: The Kabalist Bodin who has been consider ed erroneously of a feeble and super- stitious mind, had no other motive in writing his Demonomania than that of warning people against dangerous incredu lity.' Initiated by the study of the Kabalah into the true secrets of Magic, he trembled at the danger to which society was exposed by the abandonment of this power to the wicke dness of men. Hence he attempted what at the present time M. Eudes de Mirville is attempting amongst ourselves; he gathered fact s without interpreting them and affirmed in the face of inattentive or preoccupied science the exis tence of the occult influences and crim- inal operations of Evil Magi c. In his own day Bodin attracted no more attention than will be given to M. Eudes de Mirville, because it is not enough to enumerate phenomena and to prejudge their cause if we would influence serious people; we must study, explain and demons trate such cause, and this is precisely what we are ourselves attempting. Will bett er success crown our own efforts? It is possible to die through the love of certain people, even as by their hate. There are absorbing passio ns, under the breath of which we feel ourselves depleted like the spouses of vampires. Not only do th e wicked torment the good, but unconsciously the good torture the wick ed. The gentleness of Abel was a long and painful bewitchment for the ferocity of Cain. Among evil men, the hatred of good originates in the very instinct of self-preservation; moreover, they deny that what torments them is good and are driven to deify and justify evil for their own peace. In the sight of Cain, Abel was a hypocrite and coward, who abused the pride of humanity by his scandalous subm issions. to Divinity. How much must this first murderer have endured before making such a frightful attack upon his brother? Had Abel understood, he would h ave been afraid. Antipathy is the pre- sentiment of a possible bewitchment, either of love or hatred, for we find love fre- quently succeeding repulsion. The Astral Light warns us of coming influences by its action on the more or less sensible, more or less active, ne rvous system. Instan- taneous sympathies, electric loves, are expl osions of the Astral Light, which are as exactly and mathematically demonstrable as the discharge of strong magnetic batteries. Thereby we may see what unexpected danger s threaten an uninitiated person who is perpetually fooling with fire in the neighbourhood of unseen pow- der magazines. We are saturated with the Astral Light, and we project it unceas-"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"78 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic ingly to make room for and to attrac t fresh supplies. Th e nervous instruments which are specially designed either for attraction or projection are the eyes and hands. The polarity of the hand is resident in the thumb, and hence, according to the magical tradition which still lingers in rural places, whenever anyone is in sus- picious company, he should keep the t humb doubled up and hidden in the hand, and while in the main avoiding a fixed gl ance at anyone, stil l being the first to look at those whom we have reason to fe ar, so as to escape unexpected fluidic pro- jections and fascinating regards. There are certain animals which have the power of breaking the currents of Astral Light by an absorpti on peculiar to themselves. They are violently antipa- thetic to us and possess a certain sorcery of the eye: the toad, the basilisk and the tard are instances. These an imals, when tamed and carr ied alive on the person, or kept in one's rooms, are a guarantee against th e hallucinations and trickeries of ASTRAL INTOXICATION , a term made use of here fo r the first time and one which explains all phenomena of unbridled passio ns, mental exaltations and folly. Tame toads and tards, my dear sir, the discip le of Voltaire will say to me: carry them about with you, but write no more. To wh ich I may answer, that I shall think seri- ously of so doing if ever I feel tempted to laugh at anything of which I am igno- rant, or to treat those wh ose knowledge and wisdom I fail to understand as fools or as madmen. Paracelsus, the greatest of the Christian Magi, opposed bewitch- ment by the practices of a contrary be witchment. He devise d sympathetic reme- dies and applied them, not to the suffer ing members, but to representations of these, formed and con serrated accordin g to magical ceremo nial. His successes were incredible, for never has any physici an approached Paracelsus in his marvels of healing. But Paracelsus arrived at magnetism long before Mesmer and had car- ried to its final consequences this lumino us discovery, or rather this initiation into the Magic of the ancients, who better than us understood the Great Magical Agent and did not regard the Astral Light, Azot h, the Universal Magnesia of the pages, as a special animal fluid emanating only from a few secular creatures. In his occult philosophy, Paracelsus opposes Cere monial Magic, the terrible power of which he did not certainly ignore, but he so ught to decry its practices so as to dis- credit Black Magic. He locates the omnipo tence of the Magus in the interior and occult magnes, and the most skilful magnetizers of our own day could not express themselves better. At the same time he counselled th e employment of magical symbols, talismans above all, in the cure of diseases. In our eighteenth chapter we shall have occasion to retu rn to the talismans of Paracelsus, while following Gaf- farel upon the great question of o ccult iconography and numismatics. Bewitchment may be cured also by subst itution, when that is possible, and by the rupture or deflection of the astral current. The fo lk-traditions on all these points are admirable and undoubtedly of remote antiquity; they are remnants of the teaching of Druids, who were initia ted in the Mysteries of Egypt and India by"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"BEWITCHMENTS 79 wandering hierophants. Now, it is well known in vulgar Magi c that a bewitchment – that is, a determined will resolved on doing evil, invariably has its result, and cannot draw back without risk of death. The sorcerer who liberates anyone from a charm must have another obje ct for his malevolence, or it is certain that he him- self will be smitten and will perish as the victim of his ow n spells. The astral movement being circular, every azotic or magnetic emission which does not encounter its medium returns with force to its point of departure, thus explaining one of the strangest histori es in a sacred book, that of the demons sent into the swine, which thereupon cast themselves into the sea. Th is act of high initiation was nothing else but the rupture of a magne tic current infected by evil wills. Our name is legion, for we are many, said the instinctive voice of the possessed suf- ferer. Possessions by the demon are bewi tchments, and such cases are innumera- ble at the present day. A saintly monk wh o has devoted himself to the service of the insane, Brother Hilarion Tissot, ha s succeeded, after lo ng experience and incessant practice, in curing a number of patients by unconsciously using the magnetism of Paracelsus. He attributes most of his case s either to disorder of the subjects' will or to the perv erse influence of external wi lls; he regards all crimes as acts of madness and would treat the wicked as disea sed, instead of exasperating and making them incurable, under the pr etence of punishing them. What space of time must still elapse ere poor Brother Hi larion Tissot shall be hailed as a man of genius! And how many serious men, when they read this chapter, will say that Tissot and myself should tr eat one another according to our common ideas, but should refrain from publishing our theories, if we do not wish to be reckoned as physicians deserving the madhouse. It re volves, notwithstanding, said Galileo, stamping his foot upon the earth. Ye sh all know the truth, and the truth shall make you free, said the Savi our of men. It might be adde d: Ye shall love justice, and justice shall make you whole men. A vi ce is a poison, even for the body; true virtue is a pledge of longevity. The method of ceremonial bewitchments varies with times and persons; all subtle and domineering people find its s ecrets and its practi ce within themselves, without even actually calculating abou t them or reasoning on their sequence. Herein they follow instinct ive inspirations of the Great Agent, which, as we have said, accommodates itself marvellously to our vices and our virtues. It may be generally laid down, however, that we ar e subjected to the wills of others accord- ing to the analogies of our tendencies and above all of our faults. To pamper the weakness of an individuality is to posse ss ourselves of that individuality and con- vert it into an instrument in the ord er of the same errors or depravities. Now, when two natures whose defects are analogous become subordinated one to another, the result is a sort of substituti on of the stronger for the weaker, an actual obsession of one mind by the other. Ve ry often the weaker may struggle and seek to revolt, but it falls only deeper in ser vitude. So did Louis XIII conspire against"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"80 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic Richelieu and subsequently, so to speak, sought his pardon by abandoning his accomplices. We have all a ru ling defect, which is for our soul as the umbilical cord of its birth in sin, and it is by th is that the enemy can always lay hold upon us: for some it is vanity, fo r others idleness, for the majority e gotism. Let a wicked and crafty mind avail itself of this means and we are lost; we may not go mad or turn idiots, but we become positively aliena ted, in all the force of the expression – that is, we are subjected to a foreign suggestion. In such a state one dreads instinctively everything that might bring us back to re ason, and will not even lis- ten to representations that are opposed to our obsession. Here is one of the most dangerous disorders which can affect the moral nature. The sole remedy for such a bewitchment is to make use of folly itself in order to cure folly, to provide the sufferer with imaginary satisfactions in th e opposite order to that wherein he is now lost. Endeavour, for example, to cure an ambitious person by making him desire the glories of heaven – mystic re medy; cure one who is dissolute by true love – natural remedy; obtain honourab le successes for a vain person; exhibit unselfishness to the avaricious and procure for them legitimate profit by honour- able participation in generous enterprises , etc. Acting in this way upon the moral nature, we may succeed in curing a number of physical maladies, for the moral affects the physical in virtue of the m agical axiom: “That which is above is like unto that which is below.” This is why th e Master said, when speaking of the par- alyzed woman: “Satan has bound her.” A disease invariably originates in a defi- ciency or an excess, and ever at the root of a physical evil we shall find a moral disorder. This is an unc hanging law of Nature."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"81 XVII q R ASTROLOGY STELLA OS INFLEXUS O F ALL THE ARTS which have originated in anci ent magian wisdom astrology is now the most misunderstood. No one beli eves any longer in the universal harmo- nies of Nature and in the necessary inte rconnection of all ef fects with all causes. Moreover, true astrology, that which deri ves from the unique and universal dogma of the Kabalah, became profaned amon g the Greeks and Roma ns of the decline. The doctrine of the seven spheres and th e three mobiles, drawn primitively from the sephirotic decade; the character of the planets governed by angels, whose names have been changed into those of Pagan divinities; th e influence of the spheres on one another; the destiny atta ched to numbers; the scale of proportion between the celestial hierarchies correspondi ng to the human hierarchies – all this has been materialized and degraded into superstition by genethliacal soothsayers and erectors of horoscopes during the d ecline and the Middle Ages. The restora- tion of astrology to its prim itive purity would be, in a sense, the creation of an entirely new science; our present concern is only to indicate its first principles, with their more immediate and approximate consequences. We have said that the Astral Light receives and pr eserves the impressions of al l visible things; it follows herefrom that the daily position of the heaven is reflected in this light, which, being the chief agent of life , operates the conception, g estation and birth of chil- dren by a sequence of appara tuses designed naturally to this end. Now, if this light be so prodigal of images as to impa rt the visible imprints of a maternal fan- tasy or appetite to the fruit of pregnancy, still more will it transmit to the plastic and indeterminate temperament of a newl y-born child the atmospheric impres- sions and diverse infl uences which, in the entire pl anetary system, are consequent at a given moment upon such or such part icular aspect of the stars. Nothing is indifferent in Nature: a stone more or a stone less upon a road may break or mod- ify profoundly the destinies of the great est men or even the largest empires; still more must the position of th is or that star in the sky have an influence on the child who is born, and who enters by the v ery fact of his birth into the universal harmony of the sidereal worl d. The stars are bound to one another by the attrac- tions which hold them in e quilibrium and cause them to move with uniformity through space. From all spheres unto all spheres there stretch these indestructible networks of light, and there is no poin t upon any planet to which one of them is not attached. The true adept in astrology must give heed ther efore to the precise time and place of the birth which is in question; then, after an exact calculation of the astral influences, it remains for him to compute the chances of estate, that is"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"82 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic to say, the advantages or hindrances whic h the child must one day meet with by reason of position, relative s, inherited tendencies and he nce natural proclivities, in the fulfilment of his destinies. Finally, he will have also to take into consideration human liberty and its initiative, should the child eventually come to be a true man and to isolate himself by strength of will from fatal influences and from the chain of destiny. It will be seen that we do not allow too much to astrology, but so much as we leave it is indubitable: it is the scientific and m agical calculus of probabili- ties. Astrology is as ancient as astronomy, and indeed it is more ancient; all seers of lucid antiquity have accorded it their fulles t confidence; and it is not for us to con- demn and reject lightly an ything which comes before us encompassed and sup- ported by such imposing authorities. Lo ng and patient obse rvations, conclusive comparisons, frequently repeated experi ments, must have led the old sages to their decisions, and to re fute them the same labour must be undertaken from an opposite standpoint. Paracelsus was perhaps the last of the grea t practical astrol- ogers; he cured diseases by talismans formed under astral influences; he distin- guished upon all bodies the mark of thei r dominant star; there, according to him, was the true Universal Medicine, the Abso lute Science of Nature, lost by man's own fault and recovered only by a small nu mber of initiates. To recognize the sign of each star upon men, animals and plants , is the true natural science of Solomon, that science which is said to be lost, but the principles of which are preserved not- withstanding, as are all other secrets, in the symbolism of the Kabalah. It will be understood readily that in order to read the stars one must know the stars them- selves; now, this knowledge is obtained by the kabalistic DOMIFICATION of the sky and by mastering the celestial planisphere , as rediscovered and explained by Gaf- farel. In this planisphere the constellati ons form Hebrew letters, and the mytho- logical figures may be replaced by th e symbols of the Tarot. To this same planisphere Gaffarel refers the origin of patriarchal writing, and the first linea- ments of primitive charact ers may very well have been found in the chains of starry attraction, in which case the celestial book would have served as the model of Enoch's, and the kabalistic alphabet wo uld have been a syno psis of the entire sky. This is not wanting in poetry, nor above all in probabil ity, and the study of the Tarot, which is evidently the primit ive and hieroglyphic work of Enoch, as was divined by the erudite William Postel , is sufficient to convince us hereof. The signs imprinted in the As tral Light by the reflecti on and attraction of the stars are reproduced therefor e, as the sages have disc overed, on all bodies which are formed by the co-operation of that lig ht. Men bear the signs of their star on their forehead chiefly, and in their hands; animals in their whole form and in their individual signs; plants in their leaves and seed; minerals in their veins and in the peculiarities of their fracture. The study of these characters was the entire life-work of Paracelsus, a nd the figures on his talism ans are the result of his"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ASTROLOGY 83 researches; but he has given us no key to these, and hence th e astral kabalistic alphabet, with its correspo ndences, still remains to be constructed. As regards publicity, the science of nonconventional magical writing stopped with the plani- sphere of Gaffarel. The seri ous art of divination rests wholly in the knowledge of these signs. Chiromancy is the art of read ing the writing of the stars in the lines of the hand, and physiognomy seeks the same or analogous characters upon the countenance of querents. As a fact, the lines formed on the human face by ner- vous contractions are determined fatally, and the radiation of the nervous tissue is absolutely analogous to those networks which are formed between the worlds by chains of starry attraction . The fatalities of life are therefore written necessarily in our wrinkles, and a first glance frequently reveals upon the forehead of a stranger either one or more of the mysterious letters of the kabalistic planisphere. Should the letter be jagged and score d deeply, there has been a struggle between will and fatality, and in his most powerful emotio ns and tendencies the individual's entire past manifests to the Magus. From this it becomes easy to co njecture the future; and if events deceive the s agacity of the diviner from time to time, he who has consulted him will remain none the less astounde d and convinced by the superhu- man knowledge of the adept. The human head is formed upon the mode l of the celestial spheres; it attracts and it radiates, and this it is which firs t forms and manifests in the conception of a child. Hence the head is subject in an absolute mann er to astral influence, and evidences its several attractions by its diverse protuberances. The final word of phrenology is to be found therefore in scien tific and purified astrology, the prob- lems of which we bequeath to the pa tience and good faith of scholars. According to Ptolemy, the sun dries up and the moon moistens; according to the Kabalists, the sun represe nts strict Justice, while the moon is in sympathy with Mercy. It is the sun which produces storms, and, by a kind of gentle atmospheric pressure, the moon occasions the ebb and flow , or, as it were, the respiration of the sea. We read in the Zohar, one of the great sacred books of the Kabalah, that “the magical serpent, the son of the Sun, was ab out to devour the wo rld, when the Sea, daughter of the moon, set her foot upon his head and subdued him”. For this rea- son, among the ancients, Venus was the da ughter of the Sea, as Diana was identi- cal with the Moon. Hence also the name of Mary signifies star or salt of the sea. To consecrate this kabalistic doct rine in the be lief of the vulgar, it is said in prophetic language: The woman shall crush the serpent's head. Jerome Cardan, one of the boldest stude nts, and beyond contradiction the most skilful astrologer of his time – Jerome Ca rdan, who was a martyr to his faith in astrology, if we accept the le gend of his death, has left a calculation by means of which anyone can foresee the good or evil fo rtune attached to all years of his life. His theory was based upon his own experien ces, and he assures us that the calcu- lation never deceived him. To ascertain the fortune of a given year, he sums up the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"84 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic events of those which have preceded it by 4 , 8 , 12 , 19 and 30 ; the number 4 is that of realization; 8 is the number of Venus or natural things; 12 belongs to the cycle of Jupiter and corres ponds to successes; 19 has reference to the cycles of the Moon and of Mars; the number 30 is that of Saturn or Fa tality. Thus, for example, I desire to ascertain what will befall me in this present year, 1855 . I pass therefore in review those decisive events in the orde r of life and progress which occurred four years ago; the natural felicit y or misfortune of eight years back; the successes or failures belonging to twelve years since; the vicissit udes and miseries or diseases which overtook me nineteen years from now, and my tragic or fatal experiences of thirty years back.

I may suppose therefore that this year I shall experience toil, pov- erty, vexation, heart exile, change of place, publicit y and contradictions, with some eventuality which will be decisive for the rest of my life : every indication in the present leads me to endor se this forecast. Hence I conclude that, for myself and for this year, experience confirms fully the precision of Cardan's astrological calculus, which connects furthermore with the climacteric years of ancient astrol- ogers. This term signifies arranged in scal es or calculated on the degrees of a scale. Johannes Trithemius in his book on Secondary Causes has computed the recurrence of fortunate or calamitous ye ars for all empires of the world. In the twenty-first chapter of our “Ritual” we shall give an e xact analysis of this work, together with a continuation of the labour of Trithemi us to our own days and the application of his magical scale to contem porary events, so as to deduce the most striking probabilities relative to the immediate future of France, Europe and the world. According to all the grand masters in as trology, comets are the stars of excep- tional heroes, and they visit earth only to signalize great changes; the planets pre- side over collective existences and mo dify the destinies of mankind in the aggregate; the fixed stars, more remote a nd more feeble in their action, attract individuals and determine th eir tendencies. Sometimes a group of stars may com- bine to influence the destinies of a single man, whil e often a great number of souls are drawn by the distant rays of the same sun.

Before all things, however, they must liberate themselves from the fo lds of the serpent, that is, the unpurified Astral Light which envelops and imprisons them, unless the strength of their will can lift them be yond its reach. The immersion of the living star in the dead light is a frightful to rment, comparable to that of Mezentius. Therein the soul freezes and burns at the same time, and has no means of getting free except by re-entering the current of exterior forms and assuming a fleshly envelope, then energetically battling agains t instincts to streng then that moral lib- erty which will permit it at the moment of its death to break the chains of earth and wing its flight in triumph towards the star of consolation which has smiled in light upon it. Following this clue, we can understand the na ture of the fire of hell, which is identical with the demon or old serpent; we can gather also wherein con- sists the salvation and repr obation of men, all called and all elected successively, but in small number, after h aving risked fallin g into the eternal fire through their own fault. Such is the great and sublime revelation of the Magi, a revelation which is the mother of all symbols, of all dogmas, of all religions. We can realize already how far Dupuis was mistaken in regarding as tronomy as the source of every cultus. It is astronomy, on the contrary, which ha s sprung from astrology, and primitive astrology is one of the bran ches of the holy Kabalah, the science of sciences and the religion of religions. Hence upon the seventeenth page of the Tarot we find an admirable allegory – a nake d woman, typifying Truth, Nature and Wisdom at one and the same time, turns two ewers toward s earth, and pours out fire and water upon it. Above her head glitte rs the septenary, starred ab out an eight-pointed star, that of Venus, symbol of peace and love; the plants of earth are flourishing around the woman, and on one of th em the butterfly of Psyche has alighted. This emblem of the soul is replaced in some copies of the sacred book by a bird, which is a more Egyptian and probably a more ancient symbol. In the modern Tarot the plate is entitled the Glittering Star ; it is analogous to a number of Hermetic symbols, and is also in correspondence with the Blaz ing Star of Masonic initiates, which expresses most of the mysteries of Rosicrucian secret doctrine."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"86 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"87 XVIII , S CHARMS AND PHILTRES JUSTITIA MYSTERIUM CANES W E HAVE now to approach the most criminal abuse to which magical sciences can be put, namely, venomous Magic, or rather sorcery. Let it be understood here that we write not to inst ruct but to warn. If human ju stice, instead of punishing the adepts, had proscribed only the nigroman cers and poisoning sorcerers, it is cer- tain, as we have observed previously, that its severity wo uld have been well placed, since the most sever e penalties could neve r be excessive in the case of such criminals. At the same time it must not be supposed that the right of life and death which belongs secretly to the Magu s has been exercised always to satisfy some infamous vengeance, or some cupidi ty more infamous s till. In the Middle Ages, as in the ancient worl d, magical associations h ave frequently struck down or destroyed slowly the revealers or prof aners of mysteries, and when the magic sword has refrained from striking, when th e spilling of blood was dangerous, then Aqua Toffana, poisoned nosegays, the shir t of Nessus, and ot her deadly instru- ments, still stranger and stil l less known, were used to carry out sooner or later the terrible sentence of the free ju dges. We have said that th ere is in Magic a great and indicible Arcanum, which is never mentioned among adepts, which the profane above all must be prevented from divini ng. In former times, whosoever revealed, or caused the key of this supreme secret to be discovered by others through imprudent revelations, was condemned im mediately to death, and was often driven to execute the sentence himsel f. The celebrated prophetic supper of Cazotte, described by Laharpe, has no t been understood hitherto. Laharpe very naturally yielded to the t emptation of surprising his readers by amplifying the details of his narrative. Everyone present at this supper, Laharpe excepted, was an initiate who had divulged or at least profaned the mysteries. Cazotte, the most exalted of all in the scale of initiation, pronounced their sentence of death in the name of illuminism, and this sentence wa s executed variously but rigorously, even as several years and several centuries previo usly had occurred in the case of simi- lar judgements against the Abbe de Vill ars, Urban Grandier and many others. The revolutionary philosophers perished, as did Cagliostro deserted in the prisons of the Inquisition; as did the mystic ba nd of Catherine Theos; as did the impru- dent Schroepffer, driven to suicide in the midst of magical triumphs and the uni- versal infatuation; as did the deserter Kotzebue, who was stab bed by Carl Sand; as did also so many others whose corp ses have been discovered without anyone being able to ascertain th e cause of their sudden an d sanguinary death.

To adepts of good fait h, who sought to emancipate the common people, were opposed those of another sect , attached to more ancient traditions, who fought against them by means analogou s to those of thei r adversaries: the practice of the Great Arcanum was made impossible by unmasking its theory. The crowd understood nothing, but it misdoubted everything, and fell lower still in its discouragement than some had schemed to raise it. The Great Arcanum became more secret than ever; the adepts, checkm ated by each other, could exercise their power neither to govern th e uninitiated nor to deli ver themselves; they con- demned one another to the de ath of traitors; they aba ndoned one another to exile, to suicide, to the knife and the scaffold. I shall be asked possibly whether equall y terrible dangers threaten at this day the intruders into the occult sanctuary and the betrayers of its secret. Why should I answer anything to the incr edulity of the inquisitive? If I risk a violent death for their instruction, certainly they will not save me; if th ey are afraid on their own account, let them abstain from imprudent research – this is all I can say to them. Let us return to Venomous Magic. In his romance of Monte Christo, Al exandre Dumas has revealed some prac- tices of this ominous science. There is no need to traverse the same ground by repeating its melancholy theo ries of crime; describing how plants are poisoned; how animals nourished on these plants have their flesh infected, and becoming in turn the food of men, cause death withou t leaving any trace of poison; how the walls of houses are inoculated; how the air is permeated by fumes which require the glass mask of St. Croix for the operat or. Let us leave the ancient Canidia her abominable mysteries, and refrain from investigating the extent to which the infernal rites of Sagana have carried the ar t of Locusta. It is enough to state that this most infamous class of malefactors distilled together the virus of contagious diseases, the venom of re ptiles and the sap of po isonous plants; that they extracted from the fungus its deadly and narcotic pr operties, its asphyxiating principles from Datura arts-monium, from the peach and bitt er almond that poi- son one drop of which, placed on the tong ue or in the ear, d estroys, like a flash of lightning, the strongest and best const ituted living being. The white juice of sea-lettuce was boiled with milk which vipers and asps had been drowned. The sap of the manchineel or de adly fruit of Java was eith er brought ba ck with them from their long journeys, or imported at gr eat expense; so also was the juice of the cassada, and so were similar poisons. They pulverized flint, mixed with impure ashes the dried slime of re ptiles, composed hideous philtres with the virus of mares on heat and similar secretions of bitches; they mingled human blood with infamous drugs, composing an oil the mere odour of which was fatal, therein recalling the tarte bourbonnaise of Panurg e; they even concealed recipes for poi- soning in the technical lang uage of alchemy, and the sec ret of the Powder of Pro-"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"89 jection, in more than one ol d book which claims to be Hermetic, is in reality that of the Powder of Su ccession. The Grand Grimoire gi ves one in particular which is very thinly disguised under th e title of “Method of Making Gold”; it is an atro- cious decoction of verdigri s, arsenic and sawdust, wh ich, if properly prepared, should consume immediately a branch that is plunged into it and eat swiftly through an iron nail. John Baptist Port a cites in his Natura l Magic a specimen of Borgia poison, but, as may be imagined, he is deceiving the vulgar and does not divulge the truth, which would be too dangerous in such a connexion. We may therefore quote his recipe to sa tisfy the curiosity of our readers. The toad itself is not venomous, but it is a sponge for poison s, and is the mush- room of the animal kingdo m. Take, then, a plump toad , says Porta, and place it with vipers and asps in a globular bottle. Let poison ous fungi, foxgloves and hem- lock be their sole nourishm ent during a period of sever al days. Then enrage them by beating, burning and to rmenting in every conceivab le manner, till they die of rage and hunger; sprinkle th eir bodies with powdered spurge and ground glass; place them in a well-sealed retort; and extract all their moisture by fire. Let the glass cool; separate the ash of the dead bodies from the incom bustible dust which will remain at the bottom of the retort. You will then have two poisons – one liq- uid, the other a powder. The first will be fully as effi cacious as the terrible Aqua Toffana; the second, in a few days' time, will cause any person who may have a pinch of it mixed with his drink to grow wilted and old, and subsequently to die amidst horrible sufferings, or in a state of complete co llapse. It must be admitted that this recipe has a m agical physiognomy of the bl ackest and most revolting kind, and sickens one by its recollectio ns of the abominable confections of Canidia and Medea. The sorcerers of th e Middle Ages pretende d to receive such powders at the Sabbath and sold them at a high price to the malicious and igno- rant. The tradition of similar mysteries spread terror in country places and came to act as a spell. The imagination on ce impressed, the nervous system once assailed, the victim rapidly wasted away , the very dread of his relatives and friends sealing his doom. The sorcerer a nd sorceress were almost invariably a spe- cies of human toad, swolle n with long-enduring rancours. They were poor, repulsed by all and consequently full of hatred. The fear which they inspired was their consolation and their revenge; poisoned themselv es by a society of which they had experienced nothing but the rebuffs and the vices, they poisoned in their turn all those who were weak enough to fear them, and avenged upon beauty and youth their accursed old age and their atrocious ugliness. The perpetration of these evil works and the fulfilment of these loathsome myster ies constituted and confirmed what was then called a pact with the devil. It is certain that the opera- tor must have been given over body and so ul to evil and justly deserved the uni- versal and irrevocable reprobation expres sed by the allegory of hell.

But is not such gulf ne eded as a basis for th e exaltation of the most sublime virtues? Does not the depth of infernus demonstrate by antithesis the infinite height a nd grandeur of heaven? In the north, where the instincts are more repressed and deep rooted; in Italy, where the passions are more unreserved and fiery, charms and the evil eye are still dreaded; the jettatura is not to be br aved with impunity in Naples, and persons who are endowed unfortunately with this power are even distinguished by certain exterior signs. In order to guard against it , experts affirm that horns must be car- ried on the person, and the common people, who take ev erything literally, hasten to adorn themselves with sm all horns, not dreaming of the sense of the allegory. These attributes of Jupit er Ammon, Bacchus and Moses are a symbol of moral power or enthusiasm, so th at the magicians mean to s ay that, in order to with- stand the jettatura, the fatal current of in stincts must be governed by great intre- pidity, great enthusiasm, or a great thou ght. In like manner, almost all popular superstitions are vulgar inte rpretations of some grand maxim or marvellous secret of occult wisdom. Did not Pythagoras, in his admirable symbols, bequeath a per- fect philosophy to sages but a new series of vain observan ces and ridiculous prac- tices to the vulgar? Thus, when he said: “Do not pick up what falls from the table; do not cut down trees on th e great highway; kill not th e serpent when it slips into your garden.” – was he not incu lcating the precepts of char ity, either social or per- sonal, under transparent allegories? When he said: “Do not look at yourself by torchlight in a mirror,” wa s he not teaching ingeniousl y that true self-knowledge which is incompatible with factitious lights and the pr ejudgments of systems? It is the same with the other precepts of Pyth agoras, who is well known to have been followed literally by a sw arm of unintelligent discipl es; and indeed amongst our provincial superstitious observances ther e are many which belong indubitably to the primitive misconception of Pythagorean symbols. Superstition is derived from a Latin word which signifies survival. It is the sign surviving the thought; it is the dead body of a Religious Rite. Superstition is to ini- tiation what the notion of the devil is to th at of God. This is the sense in which the worship of images is forbidden, and in this sense also a doctrine most holy in its original conception may b ecome superstitious and impi ous when it has lost its spirit and its inspiration. Then does re ligion, ever one, like the Supreme Reason, exchange its vestures and abandon old Rit es to the cupidity and roguery of fallen priests, transformed by their wickedness and ignorance into jugglers and charla- tans. We may include amon g superstitions those magi cal emblems and characters, of which the meaning is understood no longer, which are engraved by chance on amulets and talismans. The magical images of the ancients we re pantacles, i.e. kabalistic syntheses. Thus the wheel of Pythagoras is a pantacle analogous to the wheels of Ezekiel; the two emblems contai n the same secrets and belong to the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"91 same philosophy; they constitute the key of all pantacles, and we have made men- tion previously of both. The four living creatures – or rather the four-headed sphinx – of the same prophet are identical with the admirable Indian symbol of A DDA - NARI , given on the next page, as having reference to the Great Arcanum. In his Apocalypse St. John followed and elaborated Ezekiel; i ndeed the monstrous figures of his won- derful book are so many magical pantacles, the key of which is easily discoverable by Kabalists. On the other hand, Christia ns, rejecting science in their anxiety to extend faith, sought later on to conceal the origin of their dogmas and condemned all kabalistic and magical books to the fl ames. To destroy orig inals gives a kind of originality to copies, as was doubtless in the mind of St. Paul when, prompted beyond question by the most laudable inte ntion, he accomplished his scientific auto-da-fe at Ephesus. In the same way, six centuries later, th e true believer Omar sacrificed the Library of Alexandria to the original ity of the Koran, and who knows whether in the time to come a future Apostle will not set fire to our literary museums and confiscate the printing-press in the interest of some fresh religious infatuation, some newly accredited legend? The study of talismans and pantacles is one of the most curious branches of Magic and connects with historical numi smatics.

What did this stone signify, and how came it to be the image of the most brilliant of luminaries? The disciples of Hermes, before promising their adepts the elixir of long life or the powder of projection, counselled them to seek for the Philosophical Stone. What is this Stone, and why is it so called? The Great Initiator of the Christians invites His believers to build on the stone or rock, if they do not wi sh their structures to be demolished. He terms Himself the cornerstone, and says to the most faithful of His Apostles, “Thou art Peter (petru s), and upon this rock (petra m) I will build My church.” This Stone, say the masters in Alchemy, is the true Salt of the Philosophers, which is the third ingredient in the composition of A Z OTH . Now, we know already that A Z OTH is the name of the great Hermetic and true Philosophical Agent; further- more, their Salt is represented under the figu re of a cubic stone, as may be seen in the TWELVE KEYS of Basil Valentine, or in the allegories of Trevisan. Once more, what is this Stone actually? It is th e foundation of absolute philosophy, it is supreme and immovable reason. Before even dreaming of the metallic work, we must be fixed for ever upon the absolute principles of wisdom; we must possess that reason which is the touchstone of truth. Never will a man of prejudices become the king of Nature and the mast er of transmutations . The Philosophical Stone is hence before all things necessary; but how is it to be found? Hermes informs us in his “Emerald Table”. We must separate the subtle from the fixed with great care and assiduous attentio n. Thus, we must separate our certitudes from our beliefs, and dist inguish sharply the respectiv e domains of science and faith, realizing that we do not know things which we believe, and that we cease immediately to believe anything which we come actually to know. It follows that the essence of the things of faith is th e unknown and the indefinite, while it is quite the reverse with the thin gs of science. It must be in ferred from this that sci- ence rests on reason and experience, whil st the basis of faith is sentiment and rea- son. In other words, the Philosophical Stone is the true certitude which human prudence assures to conscientious researc hes and modest doubt, whilst religious enthusiasm ascribes it ex clusively to faith. Now, it be longs neither to reason with- out aspirations nor to aspirations without reason; true certitude is the reciprocal acquiescence of the reason which knows in the sentiment which believes and of the sentiment which believes in the reas on which knows. Th e permanent alliance of reason and faith will result not from their absolute distinction and separation, but from their mutual contro l arid their frater nal concurrence. Such is the signifi-"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"94 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic cance of the two Pillars of Solomon's Porch, one named J AKIN and the other B OAZ , one white and the other black. They are di stinct and separate, they are even con- trary in appearance, bu t if blind force sought to join them by bringing them close to one another, the roof of the temple would collapse. Separately, their power is one; joined, they are two powers which destroy one another. For precisely the same reason the spiritual power is weaken ed whensoever it attempts to usurp the temporal, while the temporal power beco mes the victim of it s encroachments on the spiritual. Gregory VII ruined the Pa pacy; the schismatic kings have lost and will lose the monarchy. Human equilibriu m requires two feet; the worlds gravitate by means of two forces; generation needs two sexes. Such is the meaning of the arcanum of Solomon, represented by the two Pillars of the Temple, J AKIN and B OAZ . The Sun and Moon of the alchemists correspond to the same symbol and con- cur in the perfection and stability of the Philosophical Stone. The Sun is the hieroglyphic sign of truth, because it is the visible source of li ght, and the rough stone is the symbol of stability. This is why the ancient M agi regarded the stone Elagabalus as the actual type of the sun, and for this reason the mediaeval alche- mists pointed to the Philosophical Stone as the first means of making philosophi- cal gold, that is to say, of transforming the vital forces represented by the six metals into Sol, otherwise into truth a nd light, the first and indispensable opera- tion of the Great Work, leading to the secondary adaptations and discovering, by the analogies of Nature, th e natural and grosser gold to the possessors of the spir- itual and living gold, of th e true Salt, the tr ue Mercury and the true Sulphur of the philosophers. To find the Philosophical Stone is then to have discovered the Abso- lute, as the masters say oth erwise. Now, the Absolute is that which admits of no errors; it is the fixation of the volatile,; it is the rule of the imagination; it is the very necessity of being; it is the immuta ble law of reason and truth. The Absolute is that which is. Now that which is in some sense precedes he who is. God Himself cannot be in the absence of a ground of be ing and can exist only in virtue of a supreme and inevitable reason. It is this re ason which is the Absolute; it is this in which we must believe if we desire a rati onal and solid foundati on for our faith. It may be said in these days that God is merely a hypothesis, but the Absolute Rea- son is not: it is essential to being. St. Thomas once said: “A thing is not ju st because God wills it, but God wills it because it is just.” Had St. Thomas deduced all the conse quences of this beautiful thought, he would have found the Philosophical Ston e, and besides being the angel of the schools, he would have been their reformer. To believe in the reason of God and in the God of reason is to render atheism impossible. When Voltaire said: “If God did not exist, it would be necessary to in vent Him,” he felt rather than understood the reason which is in God. Does God really exist? There is no knowing, but we desire it to be so, and hence we believ e it. Faith thus formulated"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"95 is reasonable faith, for it admits the doubt of science, and, as a fact, we believe only in things which seem to us probable , though we do not know them. To think otherwise is delirium; to speak otherwise is to talk like illuminati or fanatics. Now, it is not to such persons that the Phi losophical Stone is promised. The ignora- muses who have turned primiti ve Christianity from its path by substituting faith for science, dream for experience, the fant astic for the real – inquisitors who, dur- ing so many ages, have w aged a war of exterminatio n against Magic – have suc- ceeded in enveloping with darkness the ancient discoveries of the human mind, so that we are now groping for a key to th e phenomena of Nature. Now, all natural phenomena depend upon a si ngle and immutable law, represented by the Philo- sophical Stone and especially by its cubi c form. This law, expressed by the tetrad in the Kabalah, equipped the Hebrews with all the myster ies of their divine Tetra- gram. It may be said therefore that th e Philosophical Stone is square in every sense, like the heavenly Jeru salem of St. John; that on e of its sides is inscribed with the name S H LMH and the other with that of GOD ; that one of its facets bears the name of ADAM , a second that of HEVA , and the two others those of AZOT and INRI. At the beginning of the French tr anslation of a book by the Sieur de Nuisement on the Philoso phical Salt, the spirit of the earth is represented standing on a cube over which tongue s of flame are passing; the phallus is replaced by a caduceus; the sun and moon figure on the right and left breast; the figure is bearded, crowned and holds a sceptre in his hand. This is the A Z OTH of the sages on its pedestal of Salt and Sulphur. The symb olic head of the goat of Mendes is occasionally given to this fi gure, and it is then the Baphomet of the Templars and the Word of the Gnostics, bizarre images which became scarecrows for the vulgar after affording food for re flection to sages – in nocent hieroglyphs of thought and faith which have been a pret ext for the rage of persecutions.

A great passion to which we abandon ourselves co rresponds always to a great malady in store. Mortal sins are so named because they cause death physically and posi- tively. Alexander the Great di ed of pride; he was natu rally temperate, and it was through pride that he yielded to the excess which occasioned his death. Francis I died of an adultery. Louis XV died of his Parc-aux-Cerfs. When Marat was assas- sinated he was perishing of rage and en vy. He was a monomaniac of pride, who believed himself to be the only just ma n and would have slain everything that was not Marat. Several of our contemporaries perished of fallen ambition after the Revolution of February. So soon as any wi ll is confirmed irrevocably in the ten- dency towards the absurd, the man is dead, and the rock on whic h he will break is not remote. It is therefore true to say that wisd om preserves and prolongs life. The great Master told us: “My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath everlasting life.” And when the crowd murmured, He added: “Here the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you are spirit and life.” So also, when He was about to die, He attached the remembrance of His life to the sign of Br ead, and that of His spirit to the symbol of Wine, thus instituting the communion of faith, hope and charity. Now, it is in the same sense that the H ermetic masters have said: Make gold pota- ble, and you will have the Un iversal Medicine – that is to say, appropriate truth to your needs, let it become the source at which you daily dri nk, and you will in yourself have the immortality of the sag es. Temperance, tranquillity of soul, sim- plicity of character, calmness and rational ity of will, these things not only make us happy but strong and well. By growth in reason and goodness man becomes immortal. We are the authors of our own destiny, and Go d does not save us apart from our own concurrence. There is no death for the sage; death is a phantom, made horrible by the weakness and ignoran ce of the vulgar. Change is the sign of motion, and motion reveals life; if the corpse itself we re dead, its decomposition would be impossible; all its constituent molecules are li ving and working out their liberation. Yet you dream that the spirit is set free first so that it may cease to live! You believe that thought and love can die when the grossest matter is imperish- able!

The embalming and mummification of bodi es is a superstition which is against Nature; it is an attempt to create death; it is the forcible petrification of a sub- stance which is needed by life. But, on the ot her hand, we must not be quick to destroy or make away with bodies; there is no sudde nness in the operations of Nature, and we must not risk any violent rupture of the bonds of a departing soul. Death is never instantaneous; it is, like sleep, gradual. So long as the blood has not become absolutely cold, so long as th e nerves can quiver, a man is not wholly dead, and if none of the vi tal organs are destroyed the so ul can be r ecalled, either by accident or by a strong will. A philosopher declared that he would discredit universal testimony rather than believe in the resurrectio n of a dead person, but his utterance was rash, for it was on th e faith of universal testimony that he believed in the impossibil ity of resurrection. Supposin g such an occurrence were proved, what would follow? Must we deny evidence or renounce reason? It would be absurd to say so. We should infer rather that we were wrong in sup- posing resurrection to be impossible. Ab actu ad posse valet consecutio . Let us now make bold to af firm that resurrection is possible and occurs oftener than might be thought. Many persons whose deaths have been attested legally and scientifically have been fo und afterwards in their coff ins dead indeed, but having evidently come to life and having bitten through thei r clenched hands so as to open the arteries and escape from their horrible agonies. A do ctor would tell us that such persons were in a lethargy and not dead. But what is lethargy? It is the name which we give to an uncompleted de ath, a death which is falsified by return to life. It is easy by word s to escape from a difficult y when it is impossible to explain facts. The soul is joined to th e body by means of sensibility, and when sensibility ceases it is a sure sign that th e soul is departing. The magnetic sleep is a lethargy or factitious deat h which is curable at will. The etherization or torpor produced by chloroform is a real lethargy which ends sometimes in absolute death, when the soul, ravish ed by its temporary liberatio n, makes an effort of will to become free altogether, which is possi ble for those who have conquered hell, that is to say, whose moral strength is s uperior to that of as tral attraction. Hence resurrection is possible only for elementary souls, and it is these above all who run the risk of involuntary revi val in the tomb. Great men and true sages are never buried alive. The theory and practice of re surrection will be given in our “Ritual”; to those meanwhile who may ask whether I have raised the dead, I would say that if I replied in the affirmative they would not believe me. It remains now to examin e whether the abolition of pain is possible, and whether it is wholesome to employ chlo roform or magnetism for surgical opera- tions.

It is not at the same time without legitimate dread that he approaches the end of the magical doctrine. It is a question now of reveal- ing, or rather reveiling, the Great Secret, the terrible secret, th e secret of life and death, expressed in the Bibl e by those formidable and sy mbolical words of the ser- pent, who was himself symbolical: I. N EQUAQUAM MORIEMINI ; II. S ED ERITIS ; III. S ICUT DII ; IV. S CIENTES BONUM ET MALUM . One of the privileges which belong to the initiate of the Great Arcanum, and that which sums them all, is D IVINATION . According to the vulgar comprehension of the term, to divine signifies to conjec- ture what is unknown, but its true sense is ine ffable in its sublimity. To divine ( divinare ) is to exercise divinity. The word divinus in Latin signifies something far different from divus , which is equivalent to man-god. Devin , in French, contains the four letters of the word D IEU (God), plus the letter N, which corresponds in its form to the Hebrew A LEPH ' , and kabalistically and hieroglyphically expresses the Great Arcanum, the Tarot symbol of which is the Juggler . Whosoever under- stands perfectly the absolute numeral value of M multiplied by N, with the gram- matical force of the N final in words which signify S CIENCE , A RT or P OWER , who subsequently adds the five letters of the word D EVIN , in such a way as to make five go into four, four into three, three into two and two into one, such a person, by translating the resultant number into primitive Hebrew characters, will write the occult name of the Great Arcanum, and will possess a word of which the Sacred Tetragram itself is only the equivalent and the image. To be a diviner, according to the force of the term, is hence to be divine, and something more mysterious still. Now, the two signs of human divinity, or of divine humanity, are prophecies and miracl es. To be a prophet is to see before- hand the effects which exist in causes, to read in the Astral Light; to work mira- cles is to act upon the Universal Agent and subject it to our will. The author of this book will be asked whether he is a prophet and thaumaturge. Let inquirers recur to all that he wrote before certain events took place in the world; and as to anything else that he may have said or done, would anyone believe his mere word if he made a sensational st atement? Furthermore, one of the essential conditions of divination is not to be coerced, not to suffer temptation – in other words, not to be put to the test. Never have the mast ers of science yielded to the curiosity of anyone.

To furnish proofs of science to those who suspect the very existence of science is to initiate the unw orthy, to profane the gold of the sanctu- ary, to deserve the excommunication of sages and the fate of betrayers. The essence of divinati on, that is to say, the Great Magical Arcanum, is repre- sented by all the symbols of science, and is connected intimately with the one and primeval doctrine of Hermes. In philosophy , it gives absolute certitude; in reli- gion, the universal secret of faith; in physics, the compos ition, decomposition, recomposition, realization and adaptation of Philosophical Mercury, called A Z OTH by the alchemists; in dy namics it multiplies our fo rces by those of perpet- ual motion; it is at once mystical, metaphysical and ma terial, with correspondent effects in the three worlds; it procures charity in God, truth in science and gold in riches, for metallic transmutation is at once an allegory and reality, as all the adepts of true science are perfectly well aware. Yes, gold can be made really and materially by means of the Stone of the Sages, which is an amalgam of Salt, Sul- phur and Mercury, thrice combined in A Z OTH by a triple sublimation and a triple fixation. Yes, the operation is often easy and may be accomplished in a day, an instant; at other times it requires months and years. But to succeed in the Great Work, one must be divinus – a diviner, in the kabalist ic sense of the term – and it is indispensable to have renounced, in respect of personal in terest, the advantage of wealth, so as to beco me its dispenser. Raymund Lu lly enriched sovereigns, planted Europe with instit utions and remained poor . Nicholas Flamel, who in spite of his legend is really dead, only attained the Great Work when asceticism had detached him completely from ri ches. He was initiated by a suddenly imparted understanding of the book Aesh Mezareph , written in Hebrew by the Kabalist Abraham, possibly the compiler of the Sepher Yetzirah . Now this under- standing was for Flamel an intuition deser ved, or rather, rendered possible, by the personal preparations of th e adept. I believe that I have spoken sufficiently. Divination is therefore an intuition, and the key of this intu ition is the universal and magical doctrine of analogies. By means of these analogies the Magus inter- prets visions, as did the pa triarch Joseph in Egypt, ac cording to Biblical history. The analogies in the reflectio ns of the Astral Light are as exact as the shades of colour in the solar spectrum, and can be calculated and explained with great accuracy. It is, however, indispensable to know the dreamer's degree of intellec- tual life, which, i ndeed, he will himself reveal comp letely by his own dreams and in a manner that will astonish himself. Somnambulism, presentimen ts and second sight are si mply an accidental or induced disposition to dream in a voluntar y or awakened sleep – that is, to per- ceive the analogous reflections of the Astr al Light, as we shall explain to demon- stration in our “Ritual”, when providi ng the long-sought method of regularly producing and directing magnetic phenomen a. As to divinatory instruments, they"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"101 are simply a means of communication be tween diviner and consultant, serving merely to fix the two wills upon the same sign. Vague, complex, shifting figures help to focus reflections of the astral flui d, and it is thus that lucidity is procured by coffee-grouts, mists, the white of e gg, etc., which evoke fatidic forms, existing only in the TRANSLUCID – that is, in the imagination of the operators. Vision in water is operated by the dazzlement and fa tigue of the optic nerve, which then resigns its functions to the TRANSLUCID and produces a brain illusion, in which reflections of the Astral Light are taken for real images. Henc e nervous persons, of weak sight and lively imagina tion, are best fitted for th is species of divination, which indeed is most successf ul when exercised by chil dren. Let us not misinter- pret, however, the function which we attribute to imagination in divinatory arts. It is by imagination assuredly that we see, a nd this is the natural aspect of the mira- cle; but we see true things, and in this co nsists the marvellous aspect of the natu- ral work. We appeal to the experience of all veritable adepts. The author of this book has tested every kind of divination , and has obtained results invariably in proportion to the exactitude of his scien tific operations and the good faith of his consultants. The Tarot, that miraculous work which inspired all the sacred books of antiq- uity, is the most perfect instrument of di vination, by reason of the analogical pre- cision of its figures and numbers. It can be employed with complete confidence. Its oracles are always rigorously true, at least in a certain sense, and even when it predicts nothing it reveals secret things and gives the most wise counsel to its querents. Alliette, who, in the last centu ry, from a hairdresser became a Kabalist, and kabalistically called himself Etteilla, reading his name backwards after the manner of Hebrew, Alliette, I say, after thirty years of meditation over the Tarot, was on the threshold of discovering everyth ing that is concealed in this extraordi- nary work; but he ended on ly by misplacing the keys , through want of their proper understanding, and inv erted the order and character of the figures, though without entirely destroying their analogi es, so great are the sympathy and corre- spondence which exist between them. The wr itings of Etteilla, now very rare, are obscure, wearisome and barbarous in style; they have not all been printed, and some manuscripts of this father of mod ern cartomancers are in the hands of a Paris bookseller who has been good enough to let us examine them. Their most remarkable points are the obstinate pe rseverance and incont estable good faith of the author, who all his life perceived the grandeur of the occult sciences, but was destined to die at the gate of the sanc tuary without ever pe netrating behind the veil. He had little esteem for Agrippa, made much of Jean Belot and knew nothing of the philosophy of Paracelsus; but he possessed a highly-trained intuition and great persistence of will, though his fancy exceeded his judgement. His endow- ments were insufficient for a Magus and mo re than were needed for a skilful and accredited diviner of the vulgar order.

Analogy is the final word of science and the first word of fait h. Harmony consists in equilibrium, and equilibrium subsists by th e analogy of contraries. Abso lute unity is the supreme and final reason of things. Now, this re ason can be neither one person nor three persons: it is a reason, and reason at the highest. To create equilibrium we must separate and unite – separate by the pol es, unite by the centre. To reason upon faith is to destroy faith; to create mystic ism in philosophy is to assail reason. Rea- son and faith, by their nature, mutually exclude one another, but they unite by analogy. Analogy is the sole possible media tor between finite and infinite. Dogma is the ever-ascending hypothesis of a presu mable equation. For the ignorant, it is the hypothesis which is the absolute affirmation, and the absolute affirmation which is hypothesis. Hypothe ses are necessary in science, and he who seeks to ver- ify them enlarges science without decreasing faith, for on the farther side of faith is the infinite. We believe in that which we do not know, but which reason leads us to admit. To define and circumscribe the ob ject of faith is therefore to formulate the unknown. Professi ons of faith are formulations of the ignorance and aspira- tions of man. The theorems of science are monuments of his conquests. The man who denies God is not less fanatical th an he who defines Him with pretended infallibility. God is common ly defined by the enumeration of all that He is not. Man makes God by an analogy from the les ser to the greater, whence it results that the conception of God by man is ev er that of an infinite man who makes man a finite god. Man can realize that which he believes in the measure of that which he knows, by reason of that which he kno ws not, and he can accomplish all that he wills in the measure of that which he believes and by reas on of that which he knows. The analogy of contraries is the rela tion of light and shade, of height and hollow, of plenum and void. Allegory, the mother of all dogmas, is the substitution of impressions for dies, of sh adows for realities. It is the fable of truth and the truth of fable. One does no t invent a dogma, one veil s a truth, and a shade for weak eyes is produced. The initiator is no t an impostor, he is a revealer, that is, following the meaning of the Latin word revelare , a man who veils afresh. He is the creator of a new shadow. Analogy is the key of all secrets of Nature and the sole fundamental reason of all revelations. That is why religions seem to be written in the heavens and in all Nature, which is just as it should be, for the work of God is the book of God, the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"104 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic expression of Whose thought should be seen in that which He writes, and so also of His being, since we co nceive Him only as supreme thought. Dupuis and Volney saw only a plagiarism in th is splendid correspondence, which should have led them to acknowledge the catholicity, that is, the universality of the primeval, one, magical, kabalistic and immutable doctri ne of revelation by analogy. Analogy yields all forces of Nature to the Magu s; analogy is the quint essence of the Philo- sophical Stone, the secret of perpetual motion, the quadrature of the circle, the Temple resting on the two pillars J AKIN and B OAZ , the key of the Great Arcanum, the root of the Tree of Life, the science of good and evil. To fi nd the exact scale of correspondences in things a ppreciable by science is to fix the bases of faith and thus become possessed of the rod of miracles. Now, there exists a principle and a rigorous formula, which is the Great Arcanu m. Let the wise man seek it not, since he has already found it; let the profane seek for ever: they will never find. Metallic transmutation takes place spir itually and materially by the positive key of analogies. Occult medi cine is simply the exercise of the will applied to the very source of life, to that Astral Light the existence of which is a fact, which has a movement conformed to calculations having the Great Magical Arcanum for their ascending and scale. Th is Universal Arcanum, the fi nal and eternal secret of transcendent initiation, is represented in the Tarot by a naked girl, who touches the earth only by one foot, has a magnetic rod in each hand, and seems to be run- ning in a crown held up by an angel, an eagle, a bull and a lion. Fundamentally, the figure is analogous to the cherub of Jekeskiel, of which a representation is given, and to the Indian symbol of A DDA -N ARI , which again is analogous to the A DONAI of Jekeskiel, who is vu lgarly called Ezekiel. The comprehension of this figure is the key of all oc cult sciences. Readers of my book must already under- stand it philosophically if they are at all familiar with the symbolism of the Kabalah. It remains for us now to realiz e what is the second and more important operation of the Great Work . It is something undoubtedly to find the Philosophi- cal Stone, but how is it to be ground in to the powder of projection? What are the uses of the Magical Wand? What is the real power of the Divine Names in the Kabalah? The initiates know, and those wh o are deserving of initiation will know in turn if they discover the Great Arca num by means of the very numerous and precise indications which we have give n them. Why are the se simple and pure truths for ever and of necessity concealed? Because the elect of intelligence are always few on earth and are encompassed by the foolish and wicked, like Daniel in the den of lions. Moreove r, analogy instructs us in th e laws of the hierarchy, and absolute science, being an omnipotence, must be the exclusive possession of the most worthy. The confusion of the hierarchy is the actual dest ruction of societies, for then the blind become leaders of the blind, according to the word of the Mas- ter. Give back initiation to priests and ki ngs, and order will come forth anew.

Madness itself does not occur without it. Reason is necessity , is law, is the rule of all liberty and the direction of all initiative. If God exis ts, it is by reason. The conception of an absolute God outside or independent of re ason is the idol of Black Magic and the phantom of the fiend.
