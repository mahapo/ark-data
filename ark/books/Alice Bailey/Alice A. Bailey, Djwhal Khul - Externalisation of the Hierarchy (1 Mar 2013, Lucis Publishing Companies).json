I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONSLet the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind.Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.So let it be, and help us to do our part. — 1935* * * * *Let the Lords of Liberation issue forth.Let Them bring succour to the sons of men.Let the Rider from the Secret Place come forth,And coming, save.Come forth, O Mighty One.~Let the souls of men awaken to the Light,And may they stand with massed intent.Let the fiat of the Lord go forth:The end of woe has come!Come forth, O Mighty One.~The hour of service of the Saving Force has now arrived.Let it be spread abroad, O Mighty One.Let Light and Love and Power and DeathFulfil the purpose of the Coming One.The WILL to save is here.The LOVE to carry forth the work is widely spread abroad.The ACTIVE AID of all who know the truth is also here.Come forth, O Mighty One and blend these three.Construct a great defending wall.The rule of evil now must end. — 1940* * * * *Current Great Invocation — 1945"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on EarthFrom the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work outAnd may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

Bailey"},{"pageContent":"SECTION ONE — INTRODUCTORY REMARKSTHE PERIOD OF TRANSITIONMarch 1934[3] One of the results of the world condition at this time is the speeding up ofall the atomic lives upon and within the planet. This necessarily involves theincreased vibratory activity of the human mechanism, with a consequent effectupon the psychic nature, producing an abnormal sensitivity and psychicawareness. It would be of value here to remember that the condition of humanityat this time is not the result of simply one factor, but of several—all of thembeing active simultaneously, because this period marks the close of one age andthe inauguration of the new.The factors to which I refer are, primarily, three in number:1. This is a transition period between the passing out of the Piscean Age, withits emphasis upon authority and belief, and the coming in of the Aquarian Age,with its emphasis upon individual understanding and direct knowledge. Theactivity of these forces, characteristic of the two signs, produces in the atomsof the human body a corresponding activity. We are on the verge of newknowledges and the atoms of the body are being tuned up for reception. Thoseatoms which are predominantly Piscean are beginning to slow down their activityand to be “occultly withdrawn,” as it is called, or abstracted, whilst thosewhich are responsive to the New Age tendencies are, in their turn, beingstimulated and their vibratory activity increased. [4]2. The world war marked a climax in the history of mankind, and its subjectiveeffect was far more potent than has hitherto been grasped. Through the power ofprolonged sound, carried forward as a great experiment on the battlefields allover the world during a period of four years (1914-1918), and through theintense emotional strain of the entire planetary populace, the web of ethericmatter (called the “veil of the temple”) which separates the physical and astralplanes was rent or torn asunder, and the amazing process of unifying the twoworlds of physical plane living and of astral plane experience was begun and isnow slowly going on. It will be obvious, therefore, that this must bring aboutvast changes and alterations in the human consciousness. Whilst it will usher inthe age of understanding, of brotherhood and of illumination, it will also bringabout states of reaction and the letting loose of psychic forces which todaymenace the uncontrolled and ignorant, and warrant the sounding of a note ofwarning and of caution.3. A third factor is as follows. It has been known for a long time by themystics of all the world religions and by esoteric students everywhere, thatcertain members of the planetary Hierarchy are approaching closer to the earthat this time. By this I want you to infer that the thought, or the mentalattention, of the Christ and of certain of His great disciples, the Masters ofthe Wisdom, is directed or focussed at this time on human affairs, and that someof Them are also preparing to break Their long silence and may appear lateramong men. This necessarily has a potent effect, first of all upon Theirdisciples and on those who are attuned to and synchronized with Their Minds, andsecondly, it should be remembered that the energy which flows through thesefocal points of the Divine Will will have a dual effect and be destructive aswell as constructive, according to the quality of the bodies which react to it.Different types of men respond distinctively to any inflow of energy, and atremendous psychic stimulation is at this time going on, with results bothdivinely beneficent and sadly destructive.[5] It might be added also that certain astrological relationships between theconstellations are releasing new types of force which are playing through oursolar system and on to our planet and thereby making possible developmentshitherto frustrated in expression, and bringing about the demonstration oflatent powers and the manifestation of new knowledges. All this must be mostcarefully borne in mind by the worker in the field of human affairs if thepresent crisis is to be rightly appreciated and its splendid opportunitiesrightly employed. I have felt it wise to write a few words concerning thecondition to be found in the world today especially in connection with esoteric,occult and mystical groups and the spiritualistic movement.All true spiritual thinkers and workers are much concerned at this time aboutthe growth of crime on every hand, by the display of the lower psychic powers,by the apparent deterioration of the physical body, as shown in the spread ofdisease, and by the extraordinary increase in insanity, neurotic conditions andmental unbalance. All this is the result of the tearing of the planetary web,and at the same time it is a part of the evolutionary plan and the providing ofthe opportunity whereby humanity may take its next step forward. The Hierarchyof Adepts has been divided in opinion (if so unsuitable a word can be applied toa group of souls and brothers who know no sense of separateness, but only differover problems of “skill in action”) over the present world condition. Somebelieve it to be premature and consequently undesirable and providing adifficult situation, whilst others take Their stand upon the basic soundness ofhumanity and regard the present crisis as inevitable and brought about by thedevelopments in man himself; They look upon the condition as educational and asconstituting only a temporary problem which—as it is solved—will lead mankind onthe way to a still more glorious future. But there is, at the same time, nodenying the fact that great and frequently devastating forces have been letloose upon the earth, and that the effect is a cause of grave concern to all theMasters, Their disciples and workers.[6] The difficulty can, in the main, be traced back to the overstimulation andthe undue strain placed upon the mechanism of the bodies, which the world ofsouls (in physical incarnation) have to employ as they seek to manifest on thephysical plane and so respond to their environment. The flow of energy, pouringthrough from the astral plane and (in a lesser degree) from the lower mentalplane, is brought in contact with bodies that are unresponsive at first, andover-responsive later; it pours into brain cells which, from lack of use, areunaccustomed to the powerful rhythm imposed upon them; and humanity’s equipmentof knowledge is so poor that the majority have not sense enough to proceed withcaution and to progress slowly. Therefore, they are soon in danger anddifficulty; their natures are oft so impure or so selfish that the new powerswhich are beginning to make their presence felt, and so opening up new avenuesof awareness and contact, are subordinated to purely selfish ends andprostituted to mundane objectives. The glimpses vouchsafed to the man of thatwhich lies behind the veil are misinterpreted and the information gained ismisused and distorted by wrong motives. But whether a person is unintentionallya victim of force or brings himself in touch with it deliberately, he pays theprice of his ignorance or temerity in the physical body, even though his soulmay “go marching on.”It is of no use at this time to close one’s eyes to the immediate problem or toendeavour to lay the blame for the sad failures, the occult wrecks, for thehalf-demented psychics, the hallucinated mystics and the feeble-minded dabblersin esotericism at the door of their own stupidity, or upon the backs of someteachers, groups or organisations. Much blame can indeed be placed here andthere, but it is the part of wisdom to face facts and to realise the cause ofthat which is everywhere transpiring and which can be stated as follows.The cause of the growth of the lower psychism and of the increasing sensitivityof humanity at this time is the sudden inflow of a new form of astral energythrough the rent veil which has, until a short while ago, safeguarded the [7]many. Add to this the inadequacy of the mass of human vehicles to meet the newlyimposed strain and some idea of the problem can be grasped.Let it not be forgotten, however, that there is another side to the picture. Theinflow of this energy has brought many hundreds of people into a new and deeperspiritual realisation; it has opened a door through which many will pass beforelong and take their second initiation, and it has let a flood of light into theworld—a light which will go on increasing for the next thirty years, bringingassurance of immortality and a fresh revelation of the divine potencies in thehuman being. Thus is the New Age dawning. Access to levels of inspiration,hitherto untouched, has been facilitated. The stimulation of the higherfaculties (and this on a large scale) is now possible, and the coordination ofthe personality with the soul and the right use of energy can go forward withrenewed understanding and enterprise. Ever the race is to the strong, and alwaysthe many are called and the few chosen. This is the occult law.We are now in a period of tremendous spiritual potency and of opportunity to allupon the probationary path and the path of discipleship. It is the hour whereina clarion call goes forth to man to be of good cheer and of goodwill, fordeliverance is on the way. But it is also the hour of danger and of menace forthe unwary and the unready, for the ambitious, the ignorant, and for those whoselfishly seek the Way and who refuse to tread the path of service with puremotive. Lest this widespread upheaval and consequent disaster to so many shouldseem to you unfair, let me remind you that this one life is but a second of timein the larger and wider existence of the soul, and that those who fail and aredisrupted by the impact of the powerful forces now flooding our earth willnevertheless have their vibration “stepped up” to better things along with themass of those who achieve, even if their physical vehicles are destroyed in theprocess. The destruction of the body is not the worst disaster that can overcomea man.It is not my purpose to cover the whole ground possible [8] in relation to thesituation in the field of psychism caused by the inflow of astral energy at thistime. I seek to confine myself to the effect of this inflow on aspirants andsensitives. These two words—aspirants and sensitives—are employed by me in thisarticle to distinguish the awakened seeker after control and mastery from thelower type of psychic, who is controlled and mastered. It is necessary here toremind you that psychism, so-called, can be divided into the following twogroups:Higher Psychism Lower Psychism Divine Animal Controlled Uncontrolled PositiveNegative Intelligently applied Automatic Mediatorship MediumshipThese distinctions are little understood, nor is the fact appreciated that bothgroups of qualities indicate our divinity. All are expressions of God.There are certain psychic powers which men share in common with the animals;these powers are inherent in the animal body and are instinctual, but they have,for the vast majority, dropped below the threshold of consciousness and areunrealised and therefore useless. These are the powers, for instance, of astralclairvoyance and clairaudience, and the seeing of colours and similar phenomena.Clairvoyance and clairaudience are also possible on mental levels, and we thencall it telepathy, and the seeing of symbols, for all visioning of geometricalforms is mental clairvoyance. All these powers are, however, tied up with thehuman mechanism or response apparatus, and serve to put the man in touch withaspects of the phenomenal world for which the response mechanism, which we callthe personality, exists. They are the product of the activity of the divine soulin man, which takes the form of what we call “the animal soul,” which reallycorresponds to the Holy Ghost aspect in the human microcosmic trinity. All thesepowers have their [9] higher spiritual correspondences, which manifest when thesoul becomes consciously active and controls its mechanism through the mind andthe brain. When astral clairvoyance and clairaudience are not below thethreshold of consciousness, but are actively used and functioning, it means thatthe solar plexus centre is open and active. When the corresponding mentalfaculties are present in consciousness, then it means that the throat centre andthe centre between the eyebrows are becoming “awake” and active. But the higherpsychic powers, such as spiritual perception with its infallible knowledge, theintuition with its unerring judgment, and psychometry of the higher kind withits power to reveal the past and the future, are the prerogatives of the divinesoul. These higher powers come into play when the head and heart centres, aswell as the throat centre, are brought into activity as the result of meditationand service. Let the student, however, remember two things:That the greater can always include the lesser, but the purely animal psychicdoes not include the higher.That between the lowest type of negative mediumship and the highest type ofinspired teacher and seer are found a vast diversity of grades, and that thecentres are not uniformly developed in humanity.The complexity of the subject is great, but the general situation can begrasped, the significance of the opportunity proffered can be understood, andthe right use of knowledge be employed to bring good out of the present criticalperiod, and thus the psychic and spiritual growth of man be fostered andnurtured.Two questions should, I believe, at this time engross the attention of allworkers in the field of esotericism and those who are engaged with the trainingof students and aspirants.I. How shall we train our sensitives and psychics so that the dangers can beavoided and men can go safely forward to their new and glorious heritage? [10]II. How can esoteric schools or “disciplines,” as they are sometimes called,make right use of the opportunity?Let us speak first of the training and safeguarding of our psychics andsensitives.I. The Training of PsychicsThe first thing to be borne in mind is that negative, unintelligent mediumshipand psychism reduces its exponent to the level of an automaton; it is dangerousand inadvisable because it deprives man of his free will and his positivity, andmilitates against his acting as a free intelligent human being. The man is notacting in these cases as a channel for his own soul, but is little better thanan instinctual animal, if he is not literally an empty shell, which an obsessingentity can occupy and use. When speaking thus I am dealing with the very lowesttype of animal mediumship of which there is far too much these days, and whichis the cause of concern to the best minds in all the movements which fostermediumship. A mediumship which is entered into with a fully conscious focussedattitude and in which the medium, knowingly and intelligently, vacates his bodyto an entering entity of whom he is fully aware and who takes possession withhis conscious permission in order to serve some spiritual end and help hisfellowmen can be right and good. But how often is this type of mediumship to beseen? Few mediums know the technique governing the passing in or out of aninforming entity, nor do they know how to carry on this work in such a way thatnever for a moment are they unaware of what they themselves are doing and thepurpose of their activity. Definitely and with purpose they lend their bodytemporarily to another soul for service, preserving their own integrity all thetime. The highest expression of this type of activity was the giving of his bodyby the disciple Jesus for the use of the Christ. It is in the word service thatthe whole story lies, and the safeguard. When this true mediumship is betterunderstood, we shall have the medium passing out of his body in full [11] wakingconsciousness through the orifice at the top of his head, and not, as is now thecase in the majority of instances, through the solar plexus, with nopreservation of awareness of the transaction, nor any recollection of what hastranspired.We shall then have the temporary entrance of a new tenant along the line of asynchronous vibration through the entrance in the head, and the subsequent useof the instrument of the loaned body in service of some kind or another. Butthis procedure will never be followed in order to satisfy idle curiosity, or anequally idle grief, based on personal loneliness and self-pity. At present manyof the lower kind of mediums are exploited by the curious or unhappy public, andthose peculiar human beings whose consciousness is centred entirely below thediaphragm and whose solar plexus is indeed their brain (as it is the brain ofthe animal) are forced to act as mediums to satisfy the love of sensation ordesire for comfort of their almost equally unintelligent fellowmen.At the same time, there are mediums of a very much higher order whose lives areoffered in service to advanced souls on the other side of the veil and who givethemselves so that their fellowmen may learn of them; thus, on both sides of theveil of separation, are souls aided and given opportunity to hear or serve. Butthese, too, would profit by a more intelligent training and by a more accurateunderstanding of the technique of their work and the organisation of theirbodies. They would then be better channels and more dependable intermediaries.Above all, let the psychics in the world today grasp the necessity ofcontrolling and of not being controlled; let them realise that all that they docan be done by any trained disciple of the Ageless Wisdom should the occasionwarrant it, and circumstances justify such an expenditure of force. Psychics areeasily deceived. For example, it is of course obvious that on the astral planethere is a thoughtform of myself, your Tibetan brother. All who have receivedthe disciples’ degree monthly instructions, all who read the books which I havesent out into the world with the aid of A.A.B., [12] also all who are working inmy personal group of disciples have naturally and automatically aided in theconstruction of this astral thoughtform. It is not me, nor is it linked to me,nor do I use it. I have definitely disassociated myself from it and do notemploy it as a means of contacting those I teach, for I work from choiceentirely on mental levels thereby undoubtedly limiting my range of contacts butincreasing the effectiveness of my work. This astral thoughtform is a distortionof me and my work, needless to say, and resembles an animated and galvanisedshell.Because there is in this form much emotional substance and also a certain amountof mental substance, it can make a wide appeal and its validity is such thatlike all shells, for instance, which are contacted in the seance room, itmasquerades as myself and where the intuition is unawakened the illusion iscomplete and real. Devotees can therefore tune in with great facility on thisillusory form and be completely deceived. Its vibration is of a relatively highorder. Its mental effect is like a beautiful parody of myself and serves toplace the deluded devotees in touch with the scroll of the astral light, whichis the reflection of the akashic records. These latter are the eternal scrollwhereon the plan for our world is inscribed and from which those of us who teachgather our data and much of our information. This, the astral light distorts andsteps down. Because this is a distorted image and functions in the three worldsof form and has no source of validity higher than those of form, it has in itthe seeds of separativeness and of disaster. Forms of flattery are sent out fromit, ideas of separateness, those thoughts which feed ambition and which fosterlove of power, and those germs of desire and personal longing (which dividegroups) emerge from contact with it. The results to those who are deceivedthereby are sad.I would like to point out also that trance mediumship, as it is called, mustinevitably be superseded by that mediumship which is offered by the man or womanwho is clairvoyant or clairaudient on the astral plane, and who therefore infull waking consciousness and with the physical brain alert and [13] active canoffer himself as an intermediary between men in physical plane bodies (andtherefore blind and deaf on the subtler levels) and those who, having discardedtheir bodies, are cut off from physical communication. This type of psychic cancommunicate with both groups and their value and their usefulness as mediums isbeyond computation when they are singleminded, unselfish, pure and dedicated toservice. But in the training to which they subject themselves they must avoidthe present negative methods, and instead of “sitting for development” in ablank and waiting silence, they should endeavour to work positively as souls,remaining in conscious and intelligent possession of the lower mechanism oftheir bodies; they must know which centre in that body they use whilst workingpsychically, and they must learn to look out, as souls , upon the world ofillusion in which they are undertaking to work; from their high and pureposition let them see clearly, hear truly and report accurately, and so servetheir age and generation, and make the astral plane a familiar and well-knownplace of activity, accustoming mankind to a state of existence wherein are foundtheir fellowmen, experiencing, living and following the Path.I cannot here write concerning the technique of that training. The subject istoo vast for a brief article. I do say, with emphasis, that a more careful andwise training is needed and a more intelligent use of the knowledge which isavailable, if sought after. I appeal to all who are interested in the growth ofpsychic knowledge to study, and think, and experiment, and teach, and learnuntil such time as the entire level of psychic phenomena has been lifted out ofits present ignorant, speculative and negative position to one of potentassurance, proved technique, and spiritual expression. I appeal to suchmovements as the Psychical Research Societies in the world and the vastSpiritualistic Movement to lay the emphasis on divine expression and not so muchon phenomena; let them approach the subject from the angle of service and carrytheir researches into the realm of energy, and cease to pander so much to thepublic. The opportunity [14] offered them is great and the need of their work isvital. The service rendered has been real and essential, but if these movementsare to avail themselves of the coming inflow of spiritual energy, they mustshift their attention into the realm of true values. The training of theintellect and the presenting to the world of a group of intelligent psychicsshould be a main objective, and the astral plane will then be, for them, only astage on the way to that world wherein all the spiritual Guides and Masters arefound, and from whence all souls go forth to incarnation and all souls returnfrom the place of experience and of experiment.It might be asked what ground this training should cover. I would suggest thatteaching should be given as to the nature of man and the purpose and objectivesof the soul; training can be offered as to the technique of expression, andcareful instruction also given as to the use of the centres in the etheric bodyand in the development of the ability to preserve inviolate the attitude of thepositive onlooker, who is always the directing, controlling factor. There willhave to be careful analysis of the type and character of the psychic, and thenthe application of differentiated and suitable methods so that he may progresswith the least hindrance. Training schools and classes which seek to develop thestudent must be graded according to his point in evolution, and his passing intoa group, optimistically hoping that something will happen to him whilst in it,will have to cease.The goal for the low-grade negative psychic should be the training of the mindand the closing of the solar plexus until such time as he can function as a truemediator; if this involves the temporary cessation of his mediumistic powers(and consequently of his commercial exploitation), then so much the better forhim, viewing him as an immortal soul, with a spiritual destiny and usefulness.The instruction given to the intelligent medium and psychic should lead him to afull understanding of himself and of his powers; it should develop those powerswithout risk and with care, and he should be stabilised in the position [15] ofthe positive controlling factor. His clairvoyant and clairaudient powers shouldgradually be perfected, and the right interpretation of what he sees andcontacts on the plane of illusion, the astral plane, should be cultivated.Thus we shall gradually find emerging in the world a large body of trainedpsychics whose powers are understood and who function on the astral plane withas much intelligence as they function on the physical plane, and who arepreparing themselves for the expression of the higher psychic powers—spiritualperception and telepathy. These people will constitute eventually a body oflinking souls, mediating between those who cannot see and hear on the astralplane because they are the prisoners of the physical body and those who areequally the prisoners of the astral plane, lacking the physical responseapparatus.The great need, therefore, is not that we should cease to consult and train ourpsychics and mediums, but that we should train them rightly and guard themintelligently and so link, through their means, the two worlds of the physicaland the astral. (A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol II (Esoteric Psychology), pp.555-598)II. Esoteric Schools and DisciplinesOur second question relates to the work of the esoteric schools or“disciplines,” as they are sometimes called, and the training and safeguardingof the aspirants found working in them.I would like first of all to make one point clear. The great hindrance to thework of the majority of the esoteric schools at this time is their sense ofseparateness and their intolerance of other schools and methods. The leaders ofthese schools need to absorb the following fact. All schools which recognise theinfluence of the trans-Himalayan Lodge and whose workers are linked, consciouslyor unconsciously, with such Masters of the Wisdom as the Master Morya or theMaster K.H., form one school and are part of one “discipline.” There istherefore no essential conflict of interests, and on [16] the inner side—if theyare in any way functioning effectively—the various schools and presentations areregarded as a unity. There is no basic difference in teaching, even if theterminology used may vary, and the technique of work is fundamentally identical.If the work of the Great Ones is to go forward as desired in these days ofstress and of world need, it is imperative that these various groups shouldbegin to recognise their real unity in goal, guidance and technique, and thattheir leaders should realise that it is fear of other leaders and the desirethat their group should be numerically the most important which prompts thefrequent use of the words, “This is a different discipline,” or, “Their work isnot the same as ours.” It is this attitude which is hindering the true growth ofspiritual life and understanding among the many students gathered into the manyouter organisations. At this time, the “great heresy of separateness” taintsthem. The leaders and members talk in terms of “our” and “your,” of this“discipline” and that, and of this method being right (usually their own) andthe other method which may be right, but it is probably doubtful, if notpositively wrong. Each regards their own group as specifically pledged to themand to their mode of instruction, and threaten their members with dire resultsif they cooperate with the membership of other groups. Instead, they shouldrecognise that all students in analogous schools and working under the samespiritual impulses are members of the one school and are linked together in abasic subjective unity. The time must come when these various (and at present)separative esoteric bodies will have to proclaim their identity, when theleaders and workers and secretaries will meet with each other and learn to knowand understand each other. Some day this recognition and understanding willbring them to the point where they will endeavour to supplement each other’sefforts, exchange ideas with each other, and so in truth and in deed constituteone great college of esotericism in the world, with varying classes and gradesbut all occupied with the work of training aspirants and preparing them fordiscipleship, or superintending the work of disciples as they prepare [17]themselves to take initiation. Then will cease the present attempts to hindereach other’s work by comparison of methods and of techniques, by criticism anddefamation, by warning and the cult of fear, and the insistence onexclusiveness. It is these attitudes and methods which at this time arehindering the entrance of the pure light of truth.Aspirants in these schools present a different problem from that of ordinarypsychism and mediumship. These men and women have offered themselves forintellectual training and have subjected themselves to a forcing process whichis intended to bring the full flower of the soul into premature blossoming, andthis in order more rapidly and effectively to serve the race, and to cooperatewith the plan of the Hierarchy. Such students thereby lay themselves open todangers and difficulties which would have been avoided had they chosen to go theslower and equally sure way. This fact should be realised by all workers in suchschools and the problem carefully explained to the entering aspirant, so that hemay be on his guard and adhere with care to the rules and instructions. Heshould not be permitted to be afraid or to refuse to subject himself to thisforcing process, but he should enter upon it with his eyes wide open and shouldbe taught to avail himself of the safeguards offered and the experience of theolder students.The emphasis in all esoteric schools is necessarily, and rightly, laid uponmeditation. Technically speaking, meditation is the process whereby the headcentre is awakened, brought under control and used. When this is the case, thesoul and the personality are coordinated and fused, and at-one-ment takes place,producing in the aspirant a tremendous inflow of spiritual energy, galvanisinghis whole being into activity, and bringing to the surface the latent good andalso evil. Herein lies much of the problem and much of the danger. Hence alsothe stress laid in such true schools upon the need of purity and truth.Over-emphasis has been laid upon the need for physical purity, and notsufficient emphasis laid upon the avoidance of all fanaticism and intolerance.These two qualities hinder the student far more than [18] can wrong diet, andthey feed the fires of separativeness more than any other one factor.Meditation involves the living of a one-pointed life always and every day. Thisperforce puts an undue strain on the brain cells for it brings quiescent cellsinto activity and awakens the brain consciousness to the light of the soul. Thisprocess of ordered meditation, when carried forward over a period of years andsupplemented by meditative living and one-pointed service, will successfullyarouse the entire system, and bring the lower man under the influence andcontrol of the spiritual man; it will awaken also the centres of force in theetheric body and stimulate into activity that mysterious stream of energy whichsleeps at the base of the spinal column. When this process is carried forwardwith care and due safeguards, and under direction, and when the process isspread over a long period of time there is little risk of danger, and theawakening will take place normally and under the law of being itself. If,however, the tuning up and awakening is forced, or is brought about by exercisesof various kinds before the student is ready and before the bodies arecoordinated and developed, then the aspirant is headed towards disaster.Breathing exercises or pranayama training should never be undertaken withoutexpert guidance and only after years of spiritual application, devotion andservice; concentration upon the centres in the force body (with a view to theirawakening) is ever to be avoided; it will cause overstimulation and the openingof doors on to the astral plane which the student may have difficulty inclosing. I cannot impress too strongly upon aspirants in all occult schools thatthe yoga for this transition period is the yoga of one-pointed intent, ofdirected purpose, of a constant practice of the Presence of God, and of orderedregular meditation carried forward systematically and steadily over years ofeffort.When this is done with detachment and is paralleled by a life of loving service,the awakening of the centres and the raising of the sleeping fire of kundaliniwill go forward with safety and sanity and the whole system will be brought to[19] the requisite stage of “aliveness.” I cannot too strongly advise studentsagainst the following of intensive meditation processes for hours at a time, oragainst practices which have for their objective the arousing of the fires ofthe body, the awakening of a particular centre and the moving of the serpentfire. The general world stimulation is so great at this time and the averageaspirant is so sensitive and finely organised that excessive meditation, afanatical diet, the curtailing of the hours of sleep or undue interest in andemphasis upon psychic experience will upset the mental balance and often doirretrievable harm.Let the students in esoteric schools settle down to steady, quiet, unemotionalwork. Let them refrain from prolonged hours of study and of meditation. Theirbodies are as yet incapable of the requisite tension, and they only damagethemselves. Let them lead normal busy lives, remembering in the press of dailyduties and service who they are essentially and what are their goal andobjectives. Let them meditate regularly every morning, beginning with a periodof fifteen minutes and never exceeding forty minutes. Let them forget themselvesin service, and let them not concentrate their interest upon their own psychicdevelopment. Let them train their minds with a normal measure of study and learnto think intelligently, so that their minds can balance their emotions andenable them to interpret correctly that which they contact as their measure ofawareness increases and their consciousness expands.Students need to remember that devotion to the Path or to the Master is notenough. The Great Ones are looking for intelligent cooperators and workers morethan They are looking for devotion to Their Personalities, and a student who iswalking independently in the light of his own soul is regarded by Them as a moredependable instrument than a devoted fanatic. The light of his soul will revealto the earnest aspirant the unity underlying all groups, and enable him toeliminate the poison of intolerance which taints and hinders so many; it willcause him to recognise the spiritual fundamentals which guide the steps ofhumanity; it will force [20] him to overlook the intolerance and the fanaticismand separativeness which characterise the small mind and the beginner upon thePath, and help him so to love them that they will begin to see more truly andenlarge their horizon; it will enable him to estimate truly the esoteric valueof service and teach him above all to practise that harmlessness which is theoutstanding quality of every son of God. A harmlessness that speaks no word thatcan damage another person, that thinks no thought which could poison or producemisunderstanding, and which does no action which could hurt the least of hisbrethren—this is the main virtue which will enable the esoteric student to treadwith safety the difficult path of development. Where the emphasis is laid uponservice to one’s fellowmen and the trend of the life force is outward to theworld, then there is freedom from danger and the aspirant can safely meditateand aspire and work. His motive is pure, and he is seeking to decentralise hispersonality and shift the focus of his attention away from himself to the group.Thus the life of the soul can pour through him, and express itself as love toall beings. He knows himself to be a part of a whole and the life of that wholecan flow through him consciously, leading him to a realisation of brotherhoodand of his oneness in relation to all manifested lives.THE PRESENT URGENCYOctober 10, 1934I have somewhat to say to those who are the recipients of my words as embodiedin my books and pamphlets and who, with mental interest and devotion, follow outas far as may be my line of thought.I have for years—ever since 1919—sought to aid you to the best of my ability.The Hierarchy (a name covering the working disciples of all degrees) has forhundreds of generations sought to aid humanity, and since the fifteenth centuryhas steadily approached closer to the physical plane [21] and sought to make adeeper impact on the human consciousness. This has resulted in a recognitionwhich has in it (at this time) the seeds of world salvation . Until thefifteenth century, the pull and the magnetic appeal was from the side of thewatching Elder Brothers. Today, so numerous are the inner and outer disciples,and so many are the world aspirants, the pull and the magnetic appeal arelargely equalised, and what will happen in the world unfoldment and in therecognitions by the races will be the result of mutual interplay of the twointents (I am choosing my words with care)—the intent of the Masters to helphumanity, and that of the world aspirants and disciples to aid in that helping.Esoterically speaking, a point of contact, a moment of “spiritual intercourse,”is imminent, and out of that moment a new world can be born.If that can be brought about, then there can be re-established on earth thecondition which was brought to an end in earlier days, when the Hierarchy (inorder to further man’s mental development) withdrew behind the scenes for aperiod. If this spiritual contact can be brought about, it means that theHierarchy will no longer be hidden and unknown, but will be recognised aspresent upon the physical plane. This would at first be necessarily on a smallscale, and the recognition will be confined to the aspirants and disciples.Increasingly the New Group of World Servers will be active in every nation andfound functioning throughout the entire world.The two thoughts which I seek to impress upon your minds are, first, there-establishing of this closer relation, and secondly, the work of a practicalkind that each of you can do to bring about this general recognition. I seek toemphasise the point that the final activity which will bring about thisspiritual event must come from the outer plane of physical life. All of us whoare occupied with the Plan for “the next three years” are seeking earnestly forthose who can help us and to whom appeal can be made for the putting forth ofthat final last effort which will bring the desired and anticipated result.[22] I would preface what I have to say with the reminder that I only make asuggestion and that naught that I say carries with it the slightest weight ofauthority; and also that I am aware of the frequent futility of such appeals forcooperation. The history of the world of thought evidences the fact that men areoft thrilled and enlightened and aided by ideas and by the promise of adeveloping future, but that when their aid is sought in the materialising of theidea, then their hope and interest fade out on the mental plane, or—if itreaches the world of emotion and of strong desire—the sacrifice required tobring the hope to birth on the physical plane is lacking or too feeble toproduce the longed-for result.What I have to say as a result of the urgency upon me to bring about a moreintensive cooperation upon the part of those who read with interest the pamphletThe Next Three Years, (”A Treatise on White Magic”, pp. 401-433. A Treatise onthe Seven Rays, Vol. I (Esoteric Psychology), pp. 170-189) carries not thesmallest fraction of authority. I only appeal to you in the hope of intensifyingyour effort for the space of the next two years (one has already passed),because after the early autumn of 1936, any effort along this particular linewill either have failed or will no longer be required in this particular form.My sole responsibility is to put the opportunity before the world aspirants, topoint out to them the inherent possibilities of this particular situation, toindicate lines of helpful activity, and then (having so done) to withdraw thepower of my mind and thought, and so leave each aspirant free to come to his owndecisions.The pamphlet The Next Three Years is going forth today upon its mission. Itsobjective is to educate public opinion. It carries both inspiration and thepower to produce cleavages in the life—cleavages which will produce newactivities and the cessation of old attitudes of mind. A possible happening isindicated—the formation upon the physical plane of that group of aspirants anddisciples which, [23] given time and opportunity, can salvage a distressed worldand bring light and understanding to humanity. As to this, I need say no more.All of you have read the plan as it is embodied in the pamphlet, and thechallenge to faith and the appeal to your service is before you. The next twoyears will see the decision as to whether the fusion of the inner and the outergroups of world servers can be made, or whether more time must elapse before theearlier ancient cooperation between the Hierarchy and humanity can bere-established.I speak with love and almost anxiety, and with a wider knowledge of the presenturgency than you can possibly have. I couch what I have to say to you in theform of certain questions, which I ask that you should put to yourselves withquietness and sincerity.1. Do I really and in truth desire the establishment of this closer interplaybetween the inner and outer worlds? If so, what am I prepared to do in order tobring this about?2. Is there any way in which I can make a definite contribution towards thisdesired end? Recognising my special circumstances what more can I give ina. Meditationb. Understanding of the Planc. Love of my fellowmen?Forget not that meditation clarifies the mind as to the fact and nature of thePlan, that understanding brings that Plan into the world of desire, and thatlove releases the form which will make the Plan materialise upon the physicalplane. To these three expressions of your soul I call you. All of you, withoutexception, can serve in these three ways, if you so desire.3. The objective of all the work to be done at this time is to educate publicopinion and to familiarise the thinking people of the world with the urgency andthe opportunity of the next two years. If this is indeed so, what am I doing tomake this possible? To elaborate this question: [24]a. Have I spoken to all I could in my environment, or have I been held back byfear?b. Have I made possible the wide distribution of the pamphlet on this subject?Its distribution in its present form is possible only until the fall of 1936,and the time is therefore short.c. Have I aided in a material and financial way as far as is possible? Can I domore than I have done so far to help to meet this requirement?d. What more of my time can I give to help this work, to aid those who aredistributing the pamphlet, or to gather people together for discussion? Can Inot dedicate some time every day to this definite idea and service?Responding to my appeal will involve sacrifice, but all who grasp the Plan aretoday spending themselves in the effort to lift humanity up to another rung ofthe ladder and into greater light. Their hands need strengthening, their workneeds helping, and there is not one of you who cannot do more than you aredoing, through the aid of meditation, money and thought, to salvage the world,to educate public opinion and so bring in the New Day.~A CHALLENGING OPPORTUNITYApril 1935During the Wesak Festival this year, Those Who are seeking to lift humanitynearer to the Light and to expand the consciousness of mankind, will begathering Their forces for a renewed approach with its inevitable consequences.These consequences are the stimulation of the human family to a fresh spiritualeffort; the process and the exalted Personnel involved have been described by mein my previous message (A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. II, EsotericPsychology, pp. 683-688) ; They will also bring about the strengthening of theNew Group of World Servers so that they can work with greater effectiveness,vision the Plan with greater clarity and—within themselves as a group—bring [25]about greater integration. Thus they can aid in carrying out the plans of theCouncil of the Hierarchy to meet the immediate human emergency. As I told youbefore, the plans for humanity are not laid down, for humanity determines itsown destiny; the effort is directed towards establishing a closer relationshipbetween humanity and the Hierarchy.It is possible for all aspirants and disciples to participate in this effort tothe extent of rendering the task of the Masters easier by their clarity ofthinking, their renewed spiritual effort, and the rededication of themselves tothe task of service. To this effort I call you. It is a continuing effort whichwill be spread over many years. The opportunity will be offered to all trueservers and aspirants and, above all, to the New Group of World Servers toparticipate in the establishing of the necessary momentum in the immediatecycle.I call you, therefore, to a month of inner silence, of introspective thought, ofself-control and of meditation, to self-forgetfulness and attentiveness toopportunity and not to your own inner aspiration to achieve. I call you toconcentrate upon the world need for peace, mutual understanding and illuminationand to forget utterly your own needs—mental, emotional and physical. I call youto prayer and to fasting, though along what lines your abstinence should go isfor you to decide. For the five days of meditation, I call you to a morecomplete fasting, to a grave silence, to an inner focalisation, to a purity ofthought and to an active spirit of loving kindness which will make you a purechannel. Thus will the work of the Hierarchy be facilitated and the door openedto the regenerative forces of Those extra-planetary Beings Who offer Their helpat this time and particularly during 1936. The response of this Festival willsubmit a gauge of opportunity for the guidance of the Great Ones. (This theme isdeveloped in the book, A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. II, EsotericPsychology, pp. 629-751, which contains the writings from May, 1935, to April,1938, inclusive.)One practical thing also I will ask of you. Will you say, each night andmorning, with all your heart’s desire [26] and with the attention of your mindas well, the following words. Their united saying will set up a rhythm and amomentum of great potency.Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind.Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.So let it be, and help us to do our part.These words sound simple, but the “Forces of Light” is the name for certain newPowers which are being invoked by the Hierarchy at this time, Whose potenciescan be brought into great activity at the May full moon if due effort is made.The Spirit of Peace which is invoked is an inter-planetary Agent of great powerWhose cooperation has been promised if all aspirants and disciples can cooperateto break through the shell of separation and hatred which holds our planet inthrall.May I therefore close with these simple words: Please give us your aid, mybrothers.~SEED GROUPS IN THE NEW AGEJuly 1937Earlier I gave you some thoughts anent the new groups which come intofunctioning activity under The Law of Group Progress. This law has a peculiarlyclose relation to the new Aquarian Age. (“A Treatise on the Seven Rays”, Vol.II, (“Esoteric Psychology”), pp. 174-194)Groups have always existed in the world, as for instance the family group unit,but they have been predominantly third ray groups with, therefore, a dominantouter expression and control, and originating as the result of desire. [27]Their focus has been outstandingly material, and that has been part of theintended plan. Right objectivity and expression has been the goal, and still is,of the evolutionary process. But the groups now forming are a second rayactivity and are building groups —building the forms of expression in the newage. They are not the result of desire, as the term is usually understood, forthey are founded basically on a mental impulse. They are subjective in fact andnot objective in nature. They are distinguished by quality more than by form.That they may eventually produce potent objective effects is to be desired andsuch is their intent in our minds, but—at the present stage which is that ofgermination—they are subjective and (occultly speaking) they are “working in thedark.” At some distant date, groups will emerge which will be first ray groups,animated by the will aspect and consequently still more subjective in nature andmore esoteric in origin, but with these we need not concern ourselves.These seed groups are embryonic and therefore, like germinating seeds, theiractivity is at present dual. Every seed demonstrates its life by putting out twooutward evidences of its internal life and activity, and these seed groups areno exception to this universal law. Their activity is evidenced in a relation tothe Hierarchy and their relation to each other. Not yet have they succeeded inemerging into outer plane activity. Their inner life is not adequately strong,but they are, as says the scripture, “taking root downwards” in order to “bearfruit upwards.”Should these groups develop as intended, should the corporate life of themembers persist in right integral relation and should continuance be theirkeynote, then these seed groups, tiny as they may be, will come to flower,and—through an eventual “scattering of the seed,” succeed finally in “coveringthe earth with verdure.” I am speaking here in the language of symbolism whichis, as you well know, the language of truth. One small plant which, in its turn,succeeds in producing a seed, through rightful fruition can thus reproduceitself in multiple order. Be not therefore [28] unduly impressed by thesmallness of the effort. A tiny seed is a potent force—if duly tended, rightlynurtured and ripened by sun and water within the soil—its potencies areunpredictable.Certain germ ideas are emerging into the human consciousness. These differpeculiarly from those of the past, and it is these widely different ideas whichare the distinctive characteristics of the new age, the Aquarian Age. Hithertothe great ideas which succeeded finally in controlling a race in any age havebeen the gift of the intuitive sons of men to their generation. Advanced humanbeings have then seized upon the intuited idea, subordinated it to the processof mentation, made it desirable, and then have seen it come into being throughthe “agency of recognition,” as it is occultly called. One illumined mind wouldsense the divine idea, needed for the growth of the racial consciousness, andthen would give it form; the few would recognise it and thus foster its growth;the many would eventually desire it and it then could manifest experimentallyand sporadically all over the civilised world of any age, wherever culture ofany kind made itself felt. Thus the idea was manifested.Two ways in which these determining ideas in the past came into being and playedtheir part in leading the race onward might be mentioned. One was through theteaching of some teacher who founded a school of thought, thus working throughthe minds of a chosen few, and through them eventually coloured the thoughts ofthe men of his time. Of such a teacher, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and manyothers are outstanding examples. Another method was the evocation of the desireof the masses for that which is deemed desirable and their mass reorientationtowards a fuller life expression. This life expression, founded on some voicedidea, was embodied in an ideal life. Thus the work of the Saviours of the worldcame into expression, and this brought about the emergence of a world religion.The first method was strictly mental, and even today remains so; the masses, forinstance, know little of Plato and his theories in spite of the fact that he hasmoulded human [29] minds—either through acquiescence in his theories or throughrefutation of them—down the ages. The other method is strictly emotional and somore easily colours the mass consciousness. An instance of this was the messageof the love of God which Christ enunciated and the emotional reaction of themasses to His life, His message, and His sacrifice. Thus the need of the mentalfew and the emotional many has been met down the ages. In every case, the originof the work effected and the medium whereby the race has been guided has been ahuman-divine consciousness; the medium has been a Personality Who knew and feltand was at-one with the world of ideas, with the inner world order, and withGod’s plan. The result of these two techniques of activity has been theemanation of a stream of force, coming from some layer or level of the worldconsciousness—the mental or the emotional planes—which are aspects of theconsciousness of the manifesting deity. This impact of force has evoked aresponse from those who function upon one or other of these levels of awareness.Today, as the integration of the human family proceeds and as the mental levelof contact becomes more potent, there is to be found a powerful human reactionto schools of thought and a lessened reaction to the methods of orthodoxreligion. This is due to the fact that the trend of the human consciousness is(if I might so express it) away from the emotional to the mental levels ofconsciousness, and this, as far as the masses are concerned, will go onincreasing.The time has now come when there are enough people to be found who—havingthemselves made the religious and the mental approaches to truth definitefactors in their consciousness in some small measure, and having establishedenough soul contact so that they can begin to touch the world of ideas (upon theintuitional levels of consciousness)—can employ a new technique. Together and asa group they can become sensitive to the incoming new ideas which it is intendedshould condition the new age that is upon us; together and as a group they canestablish the ideals and develop the techniques and methods of the new schoolsof [30] thought which will determine the new culture; together and as a groupthey can bring these ideas and ideals into the consciousness of the masses, sothat schools of thought and world religions can be blended into one, and the newcivilisation can emerge. It will be the product of the mental and emotionalfusion of the techniques of the Piscean Age, and it will thus produce aneventual manifestation upon the physical plane of the plan of God for theimmediate future. This is the vision which lies behind the experiment beingcarried on in the new seed groups.Looking at the whole problem from another angle, it might be stated that theeffort of the past has been to raise the consciousness of humanity through thepioneering efforts of its foremost sons. The effort of the future will be tobring down into manifestation the consciousness of the soul through thepioneering efforts of certain groups. It has therefore, as you will readilyunderstand, to be a group effort because the soul is group conscious and notindividually conscious; the newer truths of the Aquarian Age can only be graspedas a result of group endeavour. This is relatively a new thing. In the past, aman had a vision and sought to materialise it with the aid of those whom hecould impress and influence to think as he did; a man sensed an idea or intuitedan idea and then tried to give it form, later calling in the help of those whosaw his idea as an ideal; a man had a great ambition which was, in reality, adim grasping of a part of God’s general plan, and he then became a group leaderor a ruler, with the assistance of those who succumbed to his power or to hisright to guide, lead and dominate them. And so, progressively, the race has beenled from point to point and from stage to stage of unfoldment until today manyare seeing the vision, sensing the plan, and dreaming dreams which they can workout together. This they can do because they recognise each other, because theyare beginning to know themselves and each other as souls, because theirunderstanding is united and because (and this is of prime importance) the lightof the intellect, the light of knowledge, the light of the intuition and thelight of understanding is [31] evoked within them; it enters not from without;and in that light, together, they see Light. It is a group activity, a grouprecognition, and the result of group at-one-ment.All this is, however, so new and relatively so rare that these groups remain asyet in an embryonic stage. We call them the seed groups of the new age. Thereare many such, as I told you before, but all as yet so small and so undevelopedthat the success of their effort remains for the future to decide. This appliesalso to the groups which I began to build in 1931 (Discipleship in the New Age,Vols. I and II).It will be apparent to you therefore why it was necessary for the initial orfirst group to lay the emphasis upon telepathic rapport, because upon thatrapport, understandingly cultivated and developed, the success of these seedgroups must depend. It does not mean that their success depends upon theestablished success of the first group, but upon the comprehension by all thegroups of the meaning and purpose and techniques of telepathy. (See Telepathyand the Etheric Vehicle )The founding upon the inner planes of a school of telepathy to which humanitycan become sensitive, even if unconsciously so, is part of the task which thefirst group, the Telepathic Communicators, has undertaken. They are thecustodians of the group purpose, and work on mental levels. The second group,the Trained Observers, has the objective to see clearly through the use of theintuition; they serve on astral levels. The third group, the Magnetic Healers,has the objective of working with forces on the physical plane. The other sixgroups will be mentioned later.You have become somewhat accustomed to the concept of these groups. The noveltyis dying out and you are apt to ask yourselves whether there is, in the lastanalysis, anything really new in them. I will give you further on three reasonsfor the fact of their being a step in advance of anything hitherto possible onthe physical plane. This may re-establish their importance in your minds andenable you to carry forward your work with fresh ardour. I have stated [32] thatthese groups constitute an experiment and that they are connected paramountlywith the work of the new age as it will express itself through the comingcivilisation and the future culture. It might be of value here if I pointed outthe distinction which exists between a civilisation and a culture.A civilisation is an expression of a mass level of consciousness as thatconsciousness works out in physical plane awareness, physical plane adjustments,relationships and methods of living. A culture is essentially an expression ofthe intellectually and vitally mental significances and the state ofconsciousness of the mentally polarised people of the race, of theintelligentsia or of those who constitute the link between the inner world ofsoul life and the outer world of tangible phenomena. In those words the raisond’être of the mental plane is concisely stated. Its function in this connectionwill be increasingly understood during the next few decades.The masses are negative to the plane of desire and of feeling, and thecivilisation of any age is largely the exteriorisation of that particular levelof consciousness. The intelligentsia are positive and their positive mentalorientation produces the culture of their time, or their race or theircommunity. We have therefore in the human family:Masses . . . Negative . . . responsive to desire . . . CivilisationIntellectuals . . . Positive . . . responsive to mind . . . CultureIn these you have the two poles which distinguish the race, and it is throughthe interplay between these two that human activity, progress and development isgenerated and carried forward.There is another grouping which should not be overlooked. The spiritually mindedpeople of the world are negative to the higher spiritual world as it expressesitself through or calls forth the higher type of desire which we callaspiration. This produces those exponents of the spiritual nature whoconstitute—in the aggregate—the Church of Christ or the world religions in theexoteric sense and in any [33] race or time. Positive to this group and givingthem the keynote of the culture of their particular age on this higher turn ofthe spiral are the esotericists and aspirants throughout the world. These areresponsive to the mind aspect. In this way the spiritual culture and theresultant civilisation comes into being and to it the lower becomes responsive.You have, therefore, the masses and the intellectuals together negative in theirturn to the positive impression of the deeper civilisation and culture as it isexpressed through the religions of the world and the groups of idealisticesoteric seekers after reality. These latter are the glory of every age and thepositive germ of the subjective unfolding impulse which is basically the sourceof all current phenomenal appearance.This group of religionists and esoteric aspirants in their turn constitute thenegative pole to the positive impression and energy of the planetary or occultHierarchy. Consequently, we have:Negative Groups Positive Groups The Masses The Intelligentsia The Churches andreligions The Esotericists, aspirants and occultists The Esotericists, in theirturn The Planetary HierarchyBroadly speaking, these groups divide themselves into the extroverted groups andthe introverted groups, into the objective and the subjective levels ofconsciousness, and into the major divisions of the phenomenal world and theworld of spiritual realities.The problem before the Hierarchy at the beginning of the new or Aquarian Age washow to fuse and blend these two distinct groups, attitudes or states ofconsciousness so that from their fusion a third group could emerge which wouldbe exterior in its activity and yet consciously alive to the interior values;they should be able to function upon the outer plane of appearances and, at thesame time, be equally awake and active upon the inner plane of reality and ofspiritual living.This type of dual functioning is the easiest activity for [34] the Members ofthe Hierarchy and constitutes the sine qua non prior to association with thatHierarchy. It was realised that many people could be trained in the appreciationof this possibility and slowly developed to the point where theory could passinto practice. Yet these people would not be equipped throughout their naturesin such a way that they were ready to become part of the occult Hierarchy, evenin the stage of accepted disciples.It was the realisation of the need for a bridging group which would be neitherentirely negative nor entirely positive which prompted some of the Masters (Whoare connected with the Hierarchy) to form the New Group of World Servers. Thesepeople belong to neither group and yet they can function more or less inrelation to both. This, as you well know, has been done with quite a measure ofsuccess and this large group now exists and is magnetic enough to draw forthresponse from the mass of world aspirants and servers (who represent the currentcivilisation and current culture) and at the same time to absorb and thustransmit knowledge, wisdom, force and light from the Planetary Hierarchy.It has now been deemed possible to form groups within the New Group of WorldServers whose members can begin to prepare themselves to express both thephenomenal and the impulsive, the negative and the positive, the material andthe spiritual with such a measure of success that, in due time, there can existon earth a replica of the Hierarchy, its methods and techniques of work. Such isthe purpose of the groups which I have formed, and of other groups throughoutthe world who—in a different way and form, and employing perchance a differentphraseology—yet are motivated and actuated as are the seed groups for which Ihave made myself responsible.The three reasons for their importance might therefore be stated as follows:1. They constitute the germ of life which will result in the emergence of theHierarchy at a later date [35] upon earth, coming forth from the seclusion ofthe ages to function again in the light of physical day.2. They are a bridging group, bridging between the negative mass of mankind andthe positive agency of the Hierarchy. That is the reason why, in these groups,emphasis is laid upon service because that embodies response to the mass and itsneed, and upon soul contact because that embodies response to the world ofsouls, as typified for us in the occult Hierarchy.3. They also hold within themselves as a group the seeds of the comingcivilisation and the germ of the new culture. The germ of the life of the newage is there, within the husk of the old age and the old forms. Hence theopportunity, the service and the problems of these groups.Let me endeavour to indicate to you in what manner these groups can measure upto the threefold demand or opportunity mentioned above.1. They conceal and nurture the germ or seed of the new civilisation of theAquarian Age.2. They bridge between the old groups and the new group, between the mass of men(of whom the foremost find their way into the New Group of World Servers) andthe Planetary Hierarchy.3. They will constitute in the future an aspect of the Hierarchy and its workupon the outer physical plane.You will note that the first opportunity concerns the spirit aspect or the vitalimpulsive life aspect of divinity; that the second concerns the soul aspect orthe subjective consciousness aspect of divinity; whilst the third concerns thebody aspect or the physical expression, through consciousness, of the divinelife. The first three groups which I have formed are intended to be smallreflections of these three aspects from the angle of modern need and the meetingof that need.[36] I have indicated somewhat the intended work of the first group from theangle of telepathic interplay (Telepathy and the Etheric Vehicle) . The methodof communication between the Members of the Hierarchy has to be externalised,eventually, upon earth and this is one of the tasks of the group. It might be ofservice to you if I outlined a little more clearly what is the purpose of thenew seed groups, in terms of the new age civilisation and culture so that thepractical results might be visioned with clarity and some new ideals emerge asto the quality of the coming new world order.The second group, the trained observers, will inaugurate the era of light and ofa free control of the astral plane, with its quality of freedom from illusionand glamour. This freedom will be brought about when “right observation” takesthe place of the disturbed vision of the present, and glamour will be dissipatedthrough the “right direction” of the light of the soul throughout the plane ofillusion. The Aquarian Age will be predominantly the age of synthesis and light.The third group carries the initial impulse through “into the light of day” andwill bring the physical world into a condition whereby “the healing of thenations through the arising of the sun of righteousness” will become possible,because the laws of healing (which are basic and fundamental) can be applied andworked out in all departments of life upon the outer levels of appearance—fordisease is only found in the world of phenomena.As regards telepathic communication between the Members of the Hierarchy: Withinitself, the Hierarchy functions practically entirely on the plane of mind. Thisis necessarily essential and for two reasons:1. The members of the Hierarchy have freed themselves from the limitations ofbrain activity and brain consciousness. They can, therefore, in their essentialSelves and when they so choose, carry on simultaneously two different lines ofactivity—both [37] of real import. They can pursue their normal avocations uponthe physical plane (if functioning in physical bodies) and when so doing areconditioned in the performance of those activities by the brain limitations oftime consciousness and space consciousness. But they can also work upon themental plane with the chitta or mind stuff, and can do this at the same time asthey are conditioned and limited by their physical mechanism. They are thenentirely freed from the time consciousness and from any such limitations asspace relations within the solar system.2. The focus of their polarisation is on the mental plane and they functionthere as sons of mind or of manas. Their normal mode of intercourse is throughthe medium of telepathic understanding. This is the normal technique of a divineand free manasaputra.This is all made possible when a human being has polarised himself in the soulconsciousness, when the egoic lotus is unfolding and when, therefore, the mentalmethod of working is that of mental relationship or telepathy.I earlier told you that, as the race achieves increasingly a mental polarisationthrough the developing attractive power of the mental principle, the use oflanguage for the conveying of thoughts between equals or of communicating withsuperiors will fall into disuse. It will continue to be used in reaching themasses and those not functioning on the plane of mind. Already voiceless prayerand aspiration and worship are deemed of higher value than the pleadings andproclamations of voiced expression. It is for this stage in the unfoldment ofthe race for which preparation must be made, and the laws, techniques andprocesses of telepathic communication must be made plain so that they can beintelligently and theoretically understood. The method of communication betweenmembers of the Hierarchy is a tenfold process, and only in the contribution ofthe ten [38] groups (the nine and the synthesising tenth) will their share inthe externalising process, as it is to take place in the world, be completed.From certain angles the work of the second group (the Trained Observers) isexceedingly hard, harder perhaps than that of any other group—except that whichis engaged in political work. In the latter field the work of the first Ray ofWill or Power is beginning to make its presence felt, and hence the greatdifficulty. The energy which works out in political activity is not yetunderstood. The work of the Destroyer Aspect has been kept relatively in thebackground and only during the past half century has it become definitelyactive. This became possible because the whole world, practically speaking, wasinvolved and only in the region or realm of synthesis can the first Rayfunction. This is a point to be remembered and one that is little grasped asyet. I wonder if you can appreciate the importance of the two statements anentthe first Ray found in this short paragraph? I oft give you so much realinformation of which you remain oblivious.The second group is wrestling with glamour. The processes of light and theirrelation to group glamour and to individual glamour form a very closeconnection. Right illumination—which is another name or aspect of rightdirection—will take the place of glamour, and the objective (personallyconsidered) of this group of disciples is to bring “light into dark places” andillumination into their lives. It is not my intention here to deal with theproblem of glamour. With that I have concerned myself in the instructions tothis group (Glamour: A World Problem).The task of this group of disciples is closely connected with the astral task ofthe Hierarchy. This is, at this time, the dissipation of the world illusion.That has been its problem since Atlantean times, and the climaxing of its effortis imminent and immediate. It takes the form (for all illusions take tothemselves form of some kind or other) of the “pouring in of light,”esoterically understood. This is an illusion and at the same time a great andsignificant [39] spiritual fact. Hence we have today upon the physical plane theemergence of much light everywhere; we have festivals of illumination, and aconsistent endeavour on the part of all spiritual workers to enlighten mankind,and a great deal of talk on the part of educators anent illumination of a mentalkind. The keynote of this effort to eliminate world glamour was sounded byChrist when He said (following the example of Hermes, Who initiated the processof enlightenment for our race, the Aryan), “I am the Light of the World.”Disciples must learn the significance of illumination, received in meditation,and the necessity to work with light as a group for the dissipation of glamour.Hermes and Christ undertook this work of astral enlightenment and are constantlyoccupied with this task. Their work in the new age is to be aided by theintensive activity of certain groups of which this second group is one. Later,when the new civilisation is nearing appearance, these groups will all have inthem two key persons or points of energy through which the forces of Hermes andthe will of Christ will be focussed, and through which They will be enabled towork. When this takes place, the task of dissipating the world glamour will bemuch more rapid than it is today. In the meantime groups of disciples can“nurture and conceal,” thus protecting from trouble the germ or seed of the newAquarian culture and civilisation along this particular line of freedom. Again,I repeat, they must do this along with other groups, working along similarlines, either consciously or unconsciously.The second task of this group of disciples is to act as a bridge for forceswhich are seeking etheric expression and which emanate from soul levels, via themind. I have earlier pointed out in A Treatise on White Magic that the astralplane is itself an illusion. When the first task of the groups working withworld glamour is accomplished this will be evident. I can give you as yet noreal idea of the underlying meaning, for you are all working in some measureupon the plane of illusion and of glamour, and for you the world [40] illusionexists and the astral plane is for you a fact. But this I can say: for theinitiate members of the Great White Lodge the astral plane does not exist. Theydo not work on that level of consciousness, for the astral plane is a definitestate of awareness even if (from the spiritual angle) it has no true being. Itembodies the great creative work of humanity down the ages, and is the productof the 'false' imagination and the work of the lower psychic nature. Itsinstrument of creative work is the sacral and the solar plexus centres. When theenergies, finding expression through these two centres, have been transmuted andcarried to the throat and heart by advancing humanity, then the foremost peopleof the race will know that the astral plane has no true existence; they willthen work free from its impression, and the task of freeing humanity from thethraldom of its own creation will proceed apace. In the meantime a group ofdisciples is being slowly built up (of which this second group is a part and inwhich it can play an important function, and occupy a key position), which cangradually aid in the task of dispelling the great illusion and can act also as abridging group so that those who are freeing themselves from glamour can findtheir way into the vortex of influence wielded by the group, empowered thus towork. Then three things can happen:1. Those who thus approach the group will find their efforts to live free fromglamour greatly helped and intensified by the group assistance.2. They will swell the number of those so working and hasten the processes ofdissipation.3. The Hierarchy will be enabled then to work more closely upon earth and toapproach much nearer to mankind.The third function of this second group lies in a more distant future. TheHierarchy has necessarily a department of workers whose major task it is to worksolely in the world of illusion and with astral matter. This department cameinto being in Atlantean days when the great controversy [41] took place betweenthose who embodied the consciousness or soul aspect of deity and those who weresimilarly representative of the matter aspect of deity. Symbolically speaking,the left-hand and the right-hand paths came into being; white and black magicwere brought into conflict with each other and the pairs of opposites (alwaysexistent in manifestation) became active factors in the consciousness ofadvanced humanity. The battle of discrimination was opened, and humanity becameactive upon the field of Kurukshetra. Where there is no conscious response to acondition and no registered awareness, there is no problem of responsibility, asfar as the soul is concerned. In Atlantean times, this condition was evoked andhence the problem facing the race today; hence the task of the Hierarchy to freethe souls of men from the surrounding glamour and to enable them to achieveliberation. The culmination of the issue and the controversy, then initiated, isnow upon us.The third function, therefore, of the group can be grasped at this time, andeventually this branch of the hierarchical effort can find due expression uponearth.From the above analysis of opportunity it is evident how the groups have adefinite place in the plans of the Hierarchy. By developing spiritualsensitivity, and achieving freedom from glamour, the disciples who are membersof these groups can raise the racial consciousness and bring in illumination. Itshould be remembered that it is inspiration which is the goal of all truetelepathic work, and illumination which is the reward of effort and the realinstrument for the dissipation of world glamour. Thus these groups can nurturethe germ of the future culture, act also as bridging units, and externalisecertain departmental activities of the planetary Hierarchy—the next great desireof its Members.Turning now to the work of the third group, we find ourselves concerned with thetask of the magnetic healers of the world. This has been dealt with elsewhere(Esoteric Healing) . I will here refer to one or two points of more generalinterest, and to their threefold opportunity. It is [42] of interest to notethat the work of this group is perhaps one of the hardest to carry through,although from another angle it is far easier than the task of most of the othergroups, because the consciousness of the bulk of humanity is found to bepredominantly upon the plane of illusion and therefore, as the Old Commentarysays:“They who work to bring in light and yet are surrounded by the maya of thesenses, work from the point of present being and need not to move out or in, orup or down. They simply stand.”The healers of the world upon the physical plane have to work upon that planeand their task is that of bringing through the energies of life, emanating fromthe soul plane, via the mind, but excluding the emotional. These energies haveto be brought through into physical consciousness and, from the physical level,do their necessary and magnetic work. The task of the healers, if successful,involves:1. The bringing through of healing divine energy.2. The exclusion of the astral world, and therefore illusion.3. The utilisation of the healing energy in full waking consciousness upon thephysical plane.Most of the healers in the world are working as follows:1. As purely physical healers, dealing with the vital forces of the physicalbody, and with their own consciousness polarised in the etheric body.2. As emotional astral psychics, with the consciousness polarised upon theastral plane, and utilising the astral body and working in and with glamour andillusion. The effect of their work, if successful (and I would have you notethat “if,” for I deal with the idea of relative permanency) may be one of twothings:a. They may cure the physical ills in the patient which are of such a naturethat the inner astral desire (and [43] therefore the lower desire) haseventuated in physical disease, experienced in some aspect or organ of thephysical body.b. They may intensify the effect of the illusion of desire in the physical brainconsciousness and cause such a violent increase of the active energies thatdeath may occur before so very long. This is quite a frequent happening.Nevertheless death is a cure, remember this.Under these two categories the bulk of the world healers are found—sometimesdoing good, oft doing harm, even if not realising it, and even if (as is usuallythe case) of good intention. There are three other categories of healers,however, to add to the two above:3. Mental healers in the true sense of the word. Most mental healers undulyflatter themselves and work not with their minds at all. They have much mentaltheory and astral methods. Desire is the motivating power and not mentalimpulse. The true mental healer only brings about his results when he knowssomething of illumination in the technical and academic sense, and of the powerof light to dispel illusion. Disease is not an illusion; it is a definite effectof a real cause from the standpoint of average humanity. When healers can workmentally, they deal with the causes of disease and not with the effects.4. Those healers whose soul contact is established and who work through thesouls of people, enabling them therefore:a. To stand in spiritual beingb. To work, free from illusionc. To achieve true perspective upon the physical planed. To coordinate the personality and the soul so that the will of the innerspiritual man can work out upon the physical plane.5. Those who can work (as is eventually intended that this third group shouldwork) definitely as outposts of the consciousness [44] of the Hierarchy ofMasters. This work will be done in group formation and with a united synthesisedeffort. The personal effect of such healers is therefore:a. To coordinate the personality of the patient. They are themselvescoordinated.b. To bring about contact with the soul, on the part of the patient. They arethemselves vitally in contact.c. To fuse and blend the personality and the soul and thus provide an instrumentfor the distribution of spiritual energy. They are themselves thus fused.d. To understand and use the laws of true spiritual healing through intelligentactivity upon the mental plane, through freedom from glamour, and through such aright use of force that the instrument of the soul (the personality) becomesvitally magnetic.I would remind you that such effort in the early stages (and those stages arethe present ones) results inevitably in the development of a critical spiritthrough the intelligent effort being made and the discriminative recognition ofglamour in many cases, because only through such an effort can analysis of aright kind eventually be achieved and criticism be eliminated. In the meantime,those thus in training are oft a difficulty and a problem both to themselves andto their friends and co-workers. But this phase is temporary and leads to a morelasting relationship and to the emergence of that true magnetic link and lovewhich must heal and lift and stimulate all that it may contact.In the coming Aquarian Age we shall see humanity producing a culture which issensitive to the finer and higher spiritual values, a civilisation which is freefrom glamour and from much of the illusion which today colours the Aryanpeoples, and a racial life which will be embodied in those forms which willbridge the gap at present existing; it will be free from what we now know asdisease of the worst kind, though death and certain forms of bodily breakdownwhich may eventually end in death will, of course, still be prevalent. Theovercoming of death is not contingent upon the elimination [45] of bodily ills,but upon the establishing of that continuity of consciousness which carries overfrom the physical plane of life to the inner subjective existence. Of this stateof being, groups such as this third group can be the custodian and their problemis therefore:1. To establish that state of personality development which will lead tomagnetic living upon the physical plane.2. To study the laws of life, which are the laws of health and of rightrelationship.3. To develop that continuity of consciousness which will “open the doors oflife and dispel the fear of the known and of that which disappears.”From the angle of the work of the world healers, the above is a statement ofopportunity. This they face as the nucleus or one of the germs or seeds of thenew civilisation and the coming culture. It embodies the objective of all theirwork, and their contribution to the united work of the groups.Equally so, they can bridge the gap at present existing in the racialconsciousness between1. Life and death.2. The sick and the well. This is betweena. The physically sick and the inwardly well, which is the case with a few—avery few—of the advanced people, or the disciples of the world and the senioraspirants.b. The physically well and the psychically sick, which is sometimes the case,but of singular rarity.c. The physically sick, the psychologically sick, and the overshadowing soul.This situation is often found today.3. The physical plane and the world of souls, because of the development of asound instrument and the dissipation of those causes which work out as effectsin the physical body as disease, and act as barriers to the inflow of soulenergy and the entrance of soul awareness into the brain activity.[46] This bridging work, when it occurs today, is often simply a fortunate butfortuitous happening and is not the result of a consciously planned bridgingwork. But it is the intent of the Hierarchy that the groups which will be laterformed, and which are today in process of forming (including this third group ofmine) can aid in this process, if such is the will of the constituent parts.Finally, every initiate is a magnetic healer. This is a statement of fact.Though the members of the Hierarchy have each of Them Their duly appointedfunctions and Their planned activity (dependent upon Ray, upon race and upondedication) there is one activity which They share in common and that is thepower to heal. Their ability to act as magnetic healers works out in variousways, predominantly in the realm of psychological readjustments and psychicdisentanglements, and—only incidentally and as a result of the two aboveactivities—in the processes of bodily healing. You will note from the above,that the healing work done by the initiate members of the Great White Lodge isthreefold—psychological , bringing in the soul; psychic , releasing the lowerpsychic nature from illusion so that the psyche or soul can have full sway;physical , as the result of the inner psychological and psychic adjustments.This triple healing activity is intended to be the objective of all groupsworking as this third group, the magnetic healers, should work; thus will bebrought about an emergence of hierarchical effort into outer activity. Thus youwill note, my brother, that the work of the first three groups just discussed,and viewing them as constituting one unit, produces a synthetic endeavour in thethree worlds, and leads from the plane of the soul to the plane of outerexpression.~THE WORK OF THE SEED GROUPSJanuary 1938We have been endeavouring to apprehend a little more intelligently the work ofthe new age seed groups, their interrelation [47] and their work as part of thenew age “set-up,” if I might employ such a term. We considered with some carethe three major groups. We saw that each of them had three tasks to perform andwe attempted a slight analysis of their planned undertakings. Now we can do thesame with the remaining groups, particularly with the fourth and fifth whichhave education and political work as their projects. And then we will onlybriefly indicate the triple intended purpose of the sixth, seventh, eighth andninth groups. We will not take time to consider the tenth, which will becomposed of the key people in the other groups, beyond stating that when itstwenty-seven members (three from each group) are chosen and put in rapport witheach other, there should come to all the groups such a quickening of their lifethat they will become one living vibrant organism.The fourth group has ahead of it a rich and most interesting course of study andan illuminating objective. Its instructions (See Education in the New Age ) willevoke more interested response from a larger group of readers than perhaps willbe the case in the instructions of any of the other groups, except those of thesixth whose subject is religion in the new age, and the third (See EsotericHealing ). I give them in the order of their importance. They will be moredefinitely popular and meet a more general need. The interest which the teachingon education will evoke will be owing to the fact that education is today widelyrecognised as the major moulding factor, next to economic pressure andcircumstance, and there is a widespread interest in progressive education and inthe new ideals which should—and will—eventually govern educators.There is a definite stirring among the masses and the life of the mind (notethat phrase) is now more active and potent than ever before. For this there isan occult reason of a most interesting nature.Those of you who have studied The Secret Doctrine will remember that in thatmomentous period wherein animal-man made the great transition into the humanfamily and [48] humanity came into being, developing the germ of individuality,the seed of self-consciousness and embryo intellect, we are told that this eventwas brought about in three ways:1. The seed of mind was implanted in some of the aspiring animal-men by theHierarchy, and these animal men became human beings, of a very low order to besure, but still men. They were “sparked,” if I might so express it, and a pointof light appeared where before there was none. Before there was only a diffusedatomic light but no central point of light within the head, and no indication ofthe higher centres. These individuals, along with the more advanced humanitywhich came to the planet in Atlantean times (having individualised elsewhere),constitute the most advanced humanity of our present period. They representculture and understanding, no matter where it is found, or in what class orrace.2. The instinctual nature of animal-man (found active among those who had notreached the stage of any conscious aspiration) was suddenly stimulated orvitalised by the coming into expression of the first group and the directedattention of the Hierarchy, working under the ancient Law that “energy followsthought.” Thus gradually, with a remarkable rapidity, instinct became blendedinto, or resolved into, its higher expression—the intellect. Thus in due courseof time a large group of animal-men became human beings. They today representcivilisation and the masses of ordinary intelligent people, educated under themass systems of the present time, able occasionally to think and rise to mentalemergencies, yet not highly cultured. They constitute the so-called generalpublic which we designate by the words “upper and lower middle class” people,the professional classes and the bourgeoisie everywhere.3. At the same time there is to be found a vast number of people who are humanbeings but who are not the result of either of these two processes. They are theproduct of the slow moving influences of life itself, of what we are apt to callthe evolutionary urge, innate in matter itself. They [49] have painfully andwith infinitely slow processes evolved out of the animal condition into that ofhuman beings, with an awakening conscience, an urge to betterment, and anembryonic mind of such a nature that it can respond to simple educationalprocesses, when available, and is so responding. They are the illiterate masses,the still savage races and the low grade human beings who are met with in theirmillions on our planet.The cause for the momentous situation which calls for a re-alignment of oureducational systems and processes, and for a readjustment of our presentconcepts of education, is to be found in the fact that the light of knowledgeand the benefits which accrue from it have penetrated to the lowest grades ofthese slowly evolving people; all three groups are now strictly human and notsimply the first two. The highest of them is therefore nearing the stage ofdemonstrating that which is superhuman and the lowest is separating itself (byalmost imperceptible stages) from the animal condition. This necessarily causesa cleavage but it is one of which the highest group and the Hierarchy itself iscognisant, and which they “heal by their own inclusiveness.” Forget not, thatthe greater can always include the lesser and thus bridge all gaps.It is the education of these three groups which will be considered by the fourthgroup which has as its project education in the new age. Here again we touch thethreefold purpose which each group has to hold before itself and which in thepresent instance consists of:1. The educating of the lowest of these groups into which humanity dividesitself, so that they can become strictly and consciously human. This was theobjective of the impulse which inspired the Renaissance and which lay behind thework of Rousseau, that great initiate, and this is the impulse which is todayresponsible for modern Humanism with its apparent materialism and yet its deeplyspiritual subjective programme and purpose. This eventually producescivilisation by the inflow of the light of knowledge. [50]2. The education of the second group so that it may be stimulated by the inflowof the light of wisdom and thus constitute a bridging group between the othertwo, being—as it is—strictly human and self-conscious. This process will make ofits members cultural aspirants, with a new sense of values, with a recognitionof spiritual objectives and with a developed ability to make them the mouldersof public opinion. They will then be the most important group, expressing theculture of the new age. They will set the standard of values for the masses.3. The education of the advanced thinkers, of the aspirants and world disciplesin applied knowledge, expressed wisdom and occult understanding. This groupsynthesises all that is available in the other two groups and thus forms thenucleus of the Kingdom of God, of the fifth kingdom which is so rapidly cominginto being.I cannot do more than indicate these points, for their proper theme and theirelucidation will be dealt with in the group’s instructions. What I have stated,however, will serve to indicate to you the general theme of the new educationand point the way to some of the considerations which are prompting my handlingof this subject.The work to be done (political service) by the fifth group of disciples is byfar the most difficult of any for it is in many ways far less advanced. This isdue to two facts:1. The masses of men are, as yet, relatively so little evolved that the task ofthis group of workers must therefore necessarily be dependent upon the successof the educational work of the world, as it will eventually be exemplified bythe ideals and point of view of the fourth group and similar groups everywhere.2. So few truly first ray people are manifesting on the planet at this time and,when they do, their work perforce proves destructive, owing to the unevolvedcondition of the masses of men. That is why revolutions [51] so seldom, if ever,can be carried out without bloodshed, for the intended ideas have to be imposedupon the masses and are not immediately recognised and adopted by those masses,they evoke counter responses which arouse those in authority to wrong activity.The above ideas should arouse you to careful thought.Let it not be forgotten that the objective of all true governmental control isright synthesis, leading to right national and interior group activity. Theproblem resolves itself into a dual one. First of all, we have the problem ofthe type of authority which should be recognised by the peoples; and secondly,we have the problem of the methods which should be employed, so that the chosenauthoritative measures will proceed either by the method of enforced control, orwould be of such a nature that they will evoke a generously rendered andrecognised cooperation. Between these two ways of working, many changes can berung, though the system of cooperation, willingly rendered by an intelligentmajority, has never yet been seen. But we are moving towards such a condition ofworld consciousness and are on our way towards experimenting with it.Let me here briefly indicate to you some of the modes of government which havebeen tried out, or will be tried out in the future.1. Government by a recognised Spiritual Hierarchy. This Hierarchy will berelated to the masses of the people by a chain of developed men and women whowill act as the intermediaries between the ruling spiritual body and a peoplewho are oriented to a world of right values. This form of world control liesindefinitely ahead. When it becomes possible so to govern, the planetaryHierarchy will have made a major Approach to earth, and there will then bethousands of men and women in touch with Their organisation because they will bedeveloped enough to be sensitive to Its thoughts and ideas. [52]2. Government by an oligarchy of illumined minds, recognised as such by themassed thinkers, and therefore chosen by them to rule. This they will do throughthe education of the thinkers of the race in group ideas and in their rightapplication. The system of education, then prevalent, will be utilised as themedium of reaching the masses and swinging them into line with the major ideasand this will be done not by force, but through right understanding, throughanalysis, discussion and experiment. Curiously enough (from the point of view ofmany) the spiritual Hierarchy will then work largely through the worldscientists who, being by that time convinced of the factual reality of the souland wise in the uses of the forces of the soul and of nature, will constitute alinking body of occultists.3. Government by a true democracy. This again will be made possible through aright use of the systems of education and by a steady training of the people torecognise the finer values, the more correct point of view, the higher idealism,and the spirit of synthesis and of cooperative unity. Cooperative unity differsfrom an enforced unity in that the subjective spirit and the objective form arefunctioning towards one recognised end. Today, such a thing as a true democracyis unknown, and the mass of the people in the democratic countries are as muchat the mercy of the politicians and of the financial forces as are the peopleunder the rule of dictatorships, enlightened or unenlightened. These lattermight be regarded as selfish idealists. But I would have you here note the word“idealist”! When, however, the world has in it more truly awakened people andmore thinking men and women, we shall see a purification of the political fieldtaking place, and a cleansing of our processes of representation instituted, aswell as a more exacting accounting required from the people of those whom theyhave chosen to put in authority. There must eventually be a closer tie-upbetween the educational system, the legal system and the government, but it willall be directed to an effort to work out the best ideals of the thinkers of the[53] day. This period does not lie so far ahead as you might imagine,particularly if the first move in this direction is made by the New Group ofWorld Servers.This first move involves a right comprehension of goodwill. These three systems,which are the three major systems, correspond to the three major rays ofsynthesis, of idealism, and of intelligence, which are only other names for therays of Will or Power, of Love-Wisdom and of Active Intelligence.4. Government by dictatorship . This type of government divides itself intothree parts:a. Rule by a monarchy, limited usually today by the will of the people, orrather by the politicians of the period, but symbolic of the ultimate rule ofthe Hierarchy under the Kingship of the Lord of the World.b. Rule by the leader of some democratic country, who is usually called apresident, or by some statesman (no matter by what name he may choose to becalled) who is frequently an idealist, though limited by his faulty humannature, by the period in which he lives, by his advisors, and by the widespreadcorruption and selfishness. A study of such men who have held office in thiscapacity, made by a fair-minded neutral, will usually demonstrate the fact thatthey held office under the influence of some idea, which was in itselfintrinsically right (no matter how applied), which was forward-moving in itsconcept, and belonged to the then new age. This relates them to the second ray.c. Rule by dictators, whose animating principle is not one of the new ageideals, emerging in their particular time, but an idealism of a more materialkind—a generally recognised present idealism. They are not usually reactionarynor are they found among the intuitive workers of their age, but they take whatis grounded, settled and easily available—made so by the thinkers of theirtime—and then give it a material, national and selfish twist and objective, andso force it on the masses [54] by fear, warlike means and material promises.They belong, therefore, more practically to the third ray methods of work, forthey are intelligent, expedient, and materially constructive. True idealism,involving as it must the new age patterns, and religious incentives are lackingin their techniques. Nevertheless, they do lead the race on another step, forthey have a mass effect in evoking thought, and sometimes eventual resistance,as the result of that thought.Later we shall study these and other ways of governing, and analyse theirordinary modern expressions and future spiritual correspondences. These willsome day appear on earth as a result of the many experiments today going on.Remember this.As I earlier said, the processes of education, of law and of government are soclosely allied and so definitely related that if ever the work of this fifthgroup reaches a stage where it is indeed a germ of a new age organism (and manysuch groups will necessarily appear in the different countries of the world), itwill be found that they will act as a clearing house or a linking body betweenthe educators of the time, those whose task it is to enforce the law, and thestatesmen who are chosen by the educated masses to formulate the laws wherebythey should be governed. It will be apparent, therefore, along what three linesof study and work the members of this fifth group will proceed. These I will notfurther elaborate in this place.In view of the steady progress towards religious unity which has proceeded apaceduring the past 150 years, the work of the sixth group (religion in the newage), as is also the case with the first group (telepathic communication)promises rapid results. This is, however, necessarily dependent upon the “skillin action” and the willingness of the group members and allied groups to proceedwith slowness and tact.The moment any idea enters the religious field, it gains immediate momentum fromthe fact that the outstanding [55] characteristic of the human consciousness isthe sense of the Innermost or the Real, a recognition of subjective destiny, andan innate knowledge of and reaching out to the Unknown God. Therefore, any truthor presentation of truth or method which has in it the possibility of producinga nearer approach to divinity or a more rapid understanding of the “deeperBeing” evokes an immediate response and reaction. There is consequently muchneed for caution and considered action.I have already indicated to you the form that the religion of the new age willtake (See The Reappearance of the Christ ). It will be built around the periodsof the Full Moon, wherein certain great Approaches will be made to the world ofreality, also around two periods of massed Approaches to be made at the time ofthe major eclipse of the moon and of the sun during the year. The two major FullMoon Approaches will be those of the Wesak Full Moon and the Full Moon ofJune—one hitherto consecrated to the Buddha Who embodied the wisdom of God, andthe other to the Bodhisattva (known to Christians as the Christ) Who embodiedthe love of God.The platform of the new world religion will have in it three major presentationsof truth, or three major doctrines, if such an undesirable word can bepermitted. It is with the elaboration of these three points of view, orevocations of truth, that the work of the sixth group of disciples will beconcerned. They are:1. The fact of the Spirit of God, both transcendent and immanent, will bedemonstrated, and also a similar fact in relation to man. The mode of theirapproach to each other, via the soul, will be indicated. This aspect of theemerging truth might be called Transcendental Mysticism .2. The fact of the divine quality of the Forces in nature and in man and themethod of their utilisation for divine purposes by man. This might be calledTranscendental Occultism . [56]3. The fact, implied in the first, that Humanity, as a Whole , is an expressionof divinity, a complete expression, plus the allied fact of the divine natureand work of the planetary Hierarchy, and the mode of the Approach of these twogroups, in group form, to each other. This might be called TranscendentalReligion .More than this I will not here indicate as I seek to touch briefly upon theremaining three groups. I will, however, point out that we shall elaboratesomewhat the Technique of the Presence of God, approaching it from a new angle,that of the Group, and also upon the Technique of Light. Two lesser Techniques Ihave at times called to your attention and with these we will later deal, forthey are in the nature of approaches to the other two—the Technique ofIndifference and the Technique of Service (See Glamour: A World Problem ). As westudy the divine Approaches, we shall see that they involve two parties or twogroups—those found on the objective and those on the subjective side of life.The work of the seventh group, which is in the field of science, is closelyallied to that of the seventh ray and is one with a most practical physicalpurpose. It is strictly magical in its technique, and this technique is intendedto produce a synthesis between the three aspects of divinity upon the physicalplane, or between life, the solar energies and the lunar forces. This involves adifficult task and much understanding; the work to be done is not easy tocomprehend. It will be carried forward by first ray workers, assisted by seventhray aspirants, but using fifth ray methods. They will thus combine, in theirpersonnel, the work of the destroyer of outgrown forms, the findings of thescientists who penetrated behind the outer form to its motivating energy, andthe practical work of the magician who—under the law—creates the new forms, asexpressions of the inflowing life.[57] This group of disciples will make a close study of the problem of evil, andthey will bring about a better understanding of the purpose existing in matteror substance, and the inflowing enlightened and different purpose of the soulaspect. That is why (in my earlier discussion of the subject) I linked theresults of religion and of science together; religion is concerned with theawakening to conscious purpose of the soul in man or form, whilst science isconcerned with the activity of the outer form as it lives its own life, yetslowly becomes subservient to that purpose and to soul impress. This is thethought contained in the words “scientific service” as used by me. The work ofthis group is therefore a triple one:1. They will take the most advanced inferences of the workers in the field ofscience, and will then formulate the new hypotheses upon which the nextimmediate steps forward in any particular scientific field will be founded.2. They will avail themselves of the sensitive reactions which the new spiritualApproaches (as taught by the world religion of the time) will have made possibleand—utilising the inferences thus made available in connection with the innerworld of spirit—will outline the nature of the incoming forces which willdetermine and motivate the culture of the time.3. Taking the substance or material, and the spiritual inferences and thescientific hypotheses, they will formulate those forms of service on thephysical plane which will precipitate with rapidity the Plan for the immediatepresent. They will release through this blend of scientific knowledge andintuitive idealism, those energies which will further human interests, relatethe subhuman to the human through a right interplay of forces, and thus clearthe way of those intellectual impediments which will (and always have) blockedman’s approach to the superhuman world.I doubt that it will be possible to do much in connection with the forming ofthis group, and this for several reasons. [58] The first is that such a groupcannot be formed until a certain scientific discovery has been made of suchmoment that our present scientific inhibition in recognising the fact of thesoul as a creative factor, will disappear. This discovery will be part of theacknowledged “facts of science” by the year 1975. Secondly, A.A.B. has not thenecessary scientific knowledge to do more than grasp the broader outlines of theintended work, and then only primarily from the angle of the more mystical andphilosophical approaches. Nor, my brothers, have I. It will take a fifth orseventh ray initiate to deal with this matter, and though I could invoke theassistance of such a brother, it does not seem to me a profitable expenditure offorce at this time. The sigh of relief from A.A.B. as she grasps the fact thatthere is one less group to tackle on my and your behalf would almost warrant mymaking this a major reason!Let us now pass on to a brief indication of the work of the eighth group, whichis psychological service. In this field the work will be lifted out of the realmof the strictly human and will concern itself with wider issues—for, mybrothers—there are wider issues than those which concern the human family alone.The work of these disciples will cover the following three issues:1. The relation of the human soul to the subhuman kingdoms in nature and theplace of the human kingdom as an intermediary between the three higher kingdomsand the three lower.2. The quality of the soul in the three subhuman kingdoms, with particularemphasis upon the animal and the vegetable kingdoms. The consciousness of themineral kingdom is so far removed from the human that it is not possible for usto formulate anything about it in words, or to identify ourselves with it untilafter the expansion of consciousness which takes place after the thirdinitiation—that of the Transfiguration. [59]3. A study of the Plan, as it appears at this time to be working out in the fivekingdoms in nature. It will be apparent to you that the teaching connected withthis group will be more definitely and academically occult in its significancethan will be the case in the others, for it will be based upon informationcontained in The Secret Doctrine and in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . It will befounded upon certain premises contained in those volumes. Therefore, the membersof this group of disciples will be of the more orthodox persuasion; they will betheosophists by nature, and academic by disposition.The nature of the anima mundi, the fact of the subjective consciousness found inall forms without exception, and the existence of an interplay between theseforms, through the medium of the soul, will be the major theme. Soul sensitivityand reaction to the energy in any form will be the training objective of thegroup members. Owing to the difficulty of this task, the members of this eighthgroup will be chosen from the personnel of the other groups, for they will havehad a fair measure of training in their preliminary work. Two groups will thenbe interlocking groups—that which is formed of the key people in all the groups,and this one.The ninth group, whose project is financial service, will be one of the mostpractical and interesting from the standpoint of the present world situation andmodern conditions. I may begin to organise this group before long, provided someof my disciples show me the subjective signs for which I look, which involves aright understanding and spiritual appreciation of money. By this I do not meanthat any of you who do show such signs will be in this group, but you willprovide the right conditions which will make its inception possible; one or twoof the key people, however, may form part of the financial service group if theplan works out as hoped and intended.The task to be undertaken by this group is to study the significance of money asdirected and appropriated [60] energy . This direction of force producesconcretisation, and the work is then in the field of magical endeavour. As withthe work of the other groups, the task to be carried out falls into threecategories of endeavour:1. The effort to understand the nature of prana or of vital etheric energy, andthe three qualities which distinguish it; these are (as you well know) inertia,activity and rhythm or—giving them their Hindu names—tamas, rajas and sattva.When the mineral wealth of the world was undiscovered and unused, we had thestage of tamas at its deepest and most inert point. Much concerning money todayis related to the karma and destiny of the mineral kingdom. With this, however,we need not here concern ourselves. The processes of the pranic life wereoriginally carried out in the realm of barter and the exchange of that which isfound upon the surface of the earth and later went down into the depths, thusbringing into fluidity the deepest and densest expression (from the humanstandpoint) of divinity. This is a point to be remembered.Today the process is being reversed and money is connected with the produce ofthe vegetable kingdom in the form of paper money, founded upon the mineralwealth of the world. This is an interesting subjective reality to have in mind.2. A study of the processes whereby money has been steadily deflected frompersonal uses, both in the good and in the evil sense.I do not, however, intend to write a treatise upon finance. It would largely bea record of man’s dire selfishness, but I seek to deal with money as theHierarchy sees the problem, and to consider it as a form of energy, prostitutedat this time to material ends or to the selfish aspirations and ambitions ofwell-meaning servers. They are limited in their view and need to get a pictureof the possibilities inherent in the present situation which could deflect muchof this form of concretised divine energy into constructive channels and “waysof light.” [61]3. A study of the Law of Supply and Demand, so that there can be made availablefor the Masters’ work through the medium of the world disciples (of pure motiveand skill in action and tried responsibility) that which is needed, and, mybrothers, sorely needed by Them.Money has been deflected into entirely material ends, even in its philanthropicobjectives. The most spiritual use now to be found in the world is theapplication of money to the purposes of education. When it is turned away fromthe construction of the form side and the bringing about solely of materialwell-being of humanity and deflected from its present channels into trulyspiritual foundations much good will be done, the philanthropic ends and theeducational objectives will not suffer, and a step forward will be made. Thistime is not yet, but the spiritualising of money and its massing in quantitiesfor the work of the Great Ones, the Disciples of the Christ, is part of a muchneeded world service and can now make a satisfactory beginning; but it must becarried forward with spiritual insight, right technique and true understanding.Purity of motive and selflessness are taken for granted.~THE IMMEDIATE TASKSeptember 28, 1938The Hierarchy is deeply concerned over world events. I am asked to request youto continue with the goodwill work at all costs and in the face of allobstacles. The nucleus already formed must be preserved. The New Group of WorldServers must preserve its integrity and work undismayed. All is not yet lost.The steadiness of those who know God’s Plan will help humanity and aid theefforts of the Elder Brothers. They are those who love and do not hate and whowork for unity—both subjective and spiritual.This is all I can say at this time, for the Hierarchy itself knows not whichforces will prevail. They know that good must ultimately triumph but They do notknow what [62] the immediate future holds for humanity because men determinetheir own courses. The Law of Cause and Effect can seldom be offset. In thosecases where it has been offset, it has required the intervention of Forcesgreater than those available at this time upon the planet. Those greater Forcescan intervene if the world aspirants make their voices penetrate. Will this bepossible? The forces of destruction, militating against the Forces of good, have(to use your American phrase) “cornered” the money assets of the world and haveturned the tide of prana—which automatically crystallises into money and in thefinancial wealth of the world—towards entirely material, separative and personalends. It is not easily available, therefore, for the spread and culture ofgoodwill and this applies equally to the money which is in the hands ofaspirants, as in the hands of those who are purely selfishly minded. So manyaspirants have not learnt to give with sacrifice. If you can reach some of thefinancial abundance and deflect it towards the ends of the Great White Lodge ofwhich the Christ is the Master, it will be, at this time, one of the mostconstructive things you can do to help.In this time of stress and strain, my brothers, I would remind all aspirants anddisciples that there is no need for the sense of futility or for theregistration of littleness. The seed groups that will function in the new ageare, at this time, in the dark and growing stage and in the process ofexpansion, working silently. This stage is, however, most important foraccording to the healthiness of the seeds and their ability to cast strong rootsdownwards and to penetrate slowly and steadily upwards into the light, so willbe the adequacy of their contribution to the new age which is upon us. I wouldemphasise that fact to you. The New Age is upon us and we are witnessing thebirth pangs of the new culture and the new civilisation. This is now inprogress. That which is old and undesirable must go and of these undesirablethings, hatred and the spirit of separation must be the first to go.I told you before that accidents to individuals are the [63] result, usually, ofan explosion of force and that these explosions are caused by the hatreds andthe unkind thoughts and the critical words of those involved in the accident.The world situation today is not caused by the ambitions of any one person orrace, or by the materialism, aggression and pride of any particular nation. Itis not basically the result of the wrong economic conditions existing in theworld at this time. It is caused entirely by the widespread hatred in theworld—hatred of people and of races, hatred of individuals and of those inpower, or of influence, and hatred of ideas and of religious beliefs.Fundamentally, it is caused by the separative attitudes of all peoples and raceswho, down the centuries and also today, have hated each other and lovedthemselves. It is caused by people in every country, who have sought to cast theblame for conditions on everyone except themselves, and who have diligentlysought for scapegoats whereby they may feel personal immunity for their share inthe wrong thinking, the wrong speaking and the wrong doing.This fact should be grasped and faced by all aspirants and disciples, includingthe members of the seed groups. They are not immune from the prevalent failingsand many of them have sought to apportion the blame for world conditions and tocriticise those who are seeking, in their own way and fashion, to deal with thesituation. Clear thinking, a clear appraisal of causes and a loving outgoing toall, should distinguish all disciples at this time. Where this attitude does notexist, there is ever the danger of absorption into the vortex of hatred andseparativeness and the divorcing of the person by this (even if onlytemporarily) from the vortex of love. This spells danger and glamour. The veryfact that disciples are all so pronouncedly individual, intensifies theirreactions, good and bad.I stand almost bewildered (did I not know and love human nature so well) at thelittle advance in loving thinking that some disciples have shown. It is timenow, in the face of the difficulty and seeming inadequacy, to begin the intendedgroup work, if such a beginning is ever to be made. [64] Each group has beenorganised to fulfil a specific task. This united group work has not yet beenstarted. That task must be begun.Group One can telepathically influence leading people and speak to their mindsso that they may be impressed with the need which has been described by one ofthe Great Ones as “the loving salvage of the world.” They must be led to realisethat their policies must be determined by world good. The success that the grouphad in helping ... indicated their ability to be constructively useful.Group Two can work, if they are willing, in a constructive fashion to end someof the world glamour. This they can do because several of the group members havesuccessfully fought glamour in their lives.Group Three can begin group healing under direction, once certain interioradjustments have been made.Group Four can attempt to aid in the building of the world antahkarana, workingof course in group formation. This they can do if they divorce themselves, asindividuals, from all separative ideas and learn to work in the spirit of loveand with a conscious decentralisation of their personalities.There are, my brothers, weaknesses to be found in all the group members.Personality tendencies and errors exist and the mistakes which involve,primarily, a man’s own interests and his own internal life; but these constituteno serious detriment to group work, for they can be overcome or renderedentirely superficial with a very little effort. Impatience with the resultsalready achieved, a feeling of smug superiority, certain physical failings andpersonal ambitions of a superficial kind are present in several members in allof the groups. And in each group, at this time, there is one member whosedifficulties are of a more serious nature, because they constitute a truedetriment to the group life, providing (as they do) entrance for forces whichdo, most definitely, hold back the flow of spiritual life and prevent the workof a group nature moving forward to accomplishment. In these cases, what can Ido?[65] First of all, I must exert infinite patience and give to each person fulltime for change. This I have done—for years in some cases, and have therebytaxed the patience of the group members who were not implicated in theparticular situation and weakness, and who longed to begin group work. Thelesson of patience has not been lost and I would remind the group members thatif they ever hope to have hierarchical standing, they must learn that love andthat patience which can wait —thinking no evil and fostering only good.I made clear to you this year that a drastic reorganisation might be in orderand that the groups might have to be rearranged somewhat before the united groupwork could be carried forward. This reorganisation seems now to me to beunavoidable. It is not final. It does not touch the enduring, unchangingrelation which has been established and which will persist among all of youeternally. Nothing can basically separate you.The objective of the work of these seed groups is to familiarise people with thehierarchical Plan as it is working out today in this time of crisis. In theselast three words you have the theme which is of paramount importance to you atthis time. Is it? Your work is partly to dispel illusion, but primarily toimpress the Plan upon the consciousness of the leading people in the world. Ithas seemed to us that this crisis is more keenly realised by worldly people thanit is by world aspirants, who do have a slight vision of the objectives. Thosewho are not oriented to the spiritual Hierarchy and to the Path are now largelydedicated to activities of a world nature (either good or what you call bad) andthis is not true of the world aspirants. They, instead of working actively tobring about the accomplishment of the ends indicated by the Plan (which are of aspiritual nature and unifying in their effect, breeding not hatred andseparativeness, but world understanding and fusion) spend their time inspeculation, in criticism of the various world leaders and in fearfulforeboding—none of which is in the least helpful and, in the last analysis, isdefinitely [66] harmful. This harmfulness is due to a powerfully directedthoughtform, constructed by men and women of a certain aptitude in spiritualadvancement.The responsibility of thought is little grasped as yet by those who are numberedamong the world aspirants; yet their thought-making activity is now eitherdefinitely constructive or potentially destructive. I hesitate to enlarge uponthis theme, owing to the probable personality reactions which those who readthese words may generate. I am, therefore, speaking here of the world in generaland not so specifically of the world aspirants and pledged workers."},{"pageContent":"SECTION TWO — THE GENERAL WORLD PICTURETHE CAUSES OF THE WORLD DIFFICULTYSeptember 1938[69] In giving these Instructions I am anxious for you clearly to comprehend theend I have in view. Sincere students and disciples must hold ever before themthe idea of Service; in connection with our present theme this is politicalservice—along the line of world planning and world government. This teachingwill carry to the general public some idea of the trend of human destiny wherenations and larger groups are concerned, and should give a conviction ofhierarchical potency and a sense of illumination. It will, however, do this farmore easily if the ideas I attempt to convey are backed by the understandingthought, and the intelligent mental cooperation of a group of people who havepondered deeply on the theme.What is our theme? A study and an analysis, from the esoteric angle, of thesocial organisation of humanity. I seek to have you grasp some of the universalimplications which the signs of the times portray and not be entirely engrossedwith the immediate situation or dilemma; too close a perception and too near apoint of view does not tend to true understanding. It fails, for one thing, toindicate the particular place in the general world picture which the immediatehappenings outline.It is a platitude and a truism to state that humanity is today passing through acrisis of immense proportions. The causes of this crisis must be sought in manyfactors. They lie in the past; in the growth, through evolution, of certain [70]basic tendencies in man; in past mistakes, present opportunities, and thepowerful activity of the Hierarchy of Love. The future is of great promise,provided man can learn the lessons of the present which have been closelypresented to him; he must accept them and understand clearly the nature of hisproblem and of the crisis with its many ramifications and various implications.The seething turmoil in which the masses of the people are now living and theemergence of one or two key people in every nation have a close relationship.These key people make their voices heard and evoke attention; their ideas arefollowed, rightly or wrongly, with attention, appreciation or distrust. The slowand careful formation of the New Group of World Servers is indicative of thecrisis. They are overseeing or ushering in the New Age, and are present at thebirthpangs of the new civilisation, and the coming into manifestation of a newrace, a new culture and a new world outlook. The work is necessarily slow andthose of you who are immersed in the problems and the pains, find it hard toview the future with assurance or to interpret the present with clarity.I have listed some of the reasons for the present world unrest in another book(Education in the New Age, pp. 116-125) reminding you that some of the causeslie in so remote a past that history knows nothing of them. You would find ituseful to re-read those few pages at this point, for in them I sought to givesome insight into the essential situation which confronts mankind due to certainevolutionary developments:1. The point reached by humanity itself2. The emergence of the new racial type3. The ending of the Piscean Age4. The coming in of the Aquarian Age.We barely touched upon the fourth point and I am not enlarging at length upon ithere either, fascinating as speculation might be, because I am anxious to haveits major characteristics—those of unity and synthesis—stand [71] out withclarity in your minds. It gives the clue to all that is happening today in theworld of politics and international governments, and accounts for the trendtoward synthesis, amalgamation and affiliation.The remaining four causes which we will consider later might be enumerated asfollows:5. The time of the end. The judgment of people. This period of judgment is agroup interlude to the full emergence of the New Age influences.6. The levelling of all classes and distinctions so that the spiritual valuesmay appear and the spiritual Hierarchy manifest on earth.7. The fact of the Approach of the Hierarchy towards external contact withhumanity. I would suggest that you read my earlier writings on the GreatApproaches. (Esoteric Psychology (Vol.II A Treatise on the Seven Rays), pages268-283, 701-751.)8. The power and significance, politically considered, of the Great Invocation.~THE HIDDEN SOURCE OF THE OUTER TURMOILJanuary 1939Another angle from which the world situation can be viewed with profit is tolook for the hidden source of the outer turmoil. This is seldom what men thinkit is, for the source lies in the realm of energies and forces. As I explainedelsewhere (The Destiny of the Nations, pages 3-47) , there are three greatstreams of energy working powerfully in the world at this time and two othersare also struggling for expression, making the five that—together—will determinethe trend of world affairs. To repeat briefly:1. The first and the most powerful force is that pouring into the world fromShamballa , the planetary centre where the Will of God is known. Only twice inour planetary [72] history has this Shamballa energy made its presence feltdirectly : the first time, when the great human crisis occurred at theindividualisation of man in ancient Lemuria; the second time, in Atlantean daysin the great struggle between the Lords of Light and the Lords of Material Form,also called the Dark Forces. Today, this force streams out from the Holy Centre;it embodies the Will aspect of the present world crisis and its two subsidiaryeffects or qualities are:a. The destruction of that which is undesirable and hindering in the presentworld forms (in government, religion and society).b. The synthesising force which binds together that which has hitherto beenseparated.The Shamballa force is so new and so unrecognised that it is hard for humanityto know it for what it is—the demonstration of the beneficent Will of God in newand potent livingness.2. The second major force which is potently making itself felt today is that ofthe spiritual Hierarchy , the planetary centre where the Love of God holds sway,as it swings into one of its major cyclic approaches to the earth. The problembefore the Hierarchy at this time is so to direct and control all five of thepowerful energies that the Divine Plan can materialise, and the close of thiscentury see the Purpose of God for humanity assuming right direction andproportion.3. Humanity itself is the third major planetary centre through which one of thethree divine aspects, Intelligence, is expressing itself, producing its worldeffects.These three centres are closely interrelated and must be thought of asexpressions of divine livingness, as embodying three stages in the unfoldment ofGod’s Plan, and as constituting the three major centres—Head, Heart, Throat—inthe body of the One in Whom we live and move and [73] have our being. Studentscan relate these three centres to the three solar systems, referred to in ATreatise on Cosmic Fire . In the first solar system, the centre which isHumanity was prepared and the principle of intelligence came into manifestation.In the second solar system, the Hierarchy of Love made its appearance and mustcome into full manifestation, thereby enabling the love of God to be seen. Inthe next solar system, the centre which we today call Shamballa, will manifestthe Will aspect of Deity intelligently through love. It is interesting to notethat it is only through human beings, that these three centres ever come intotrue functioning activity; and likewise that the three major ideologies (thetotalitarian, the democratic, the communistic) may be the response—distorted andyet responsive—to the forces playing from the two higher centres on to thehuman. This we discussed earlier (The Destiny of the Nations, page 22).Those of you who are seeking to serve humanity and to join in the Hierarchicaleffort to bring healing to a world in pain, must learn to penetrate behindappearances, behind the methods and schemes, the results and effects on thephysical plane and endeavour to contact the forces of Shamballa or of theHierarchy, plus the human need which has produced these modes of expression andthus see them for what they are—not worn out systems and childish efforts atimprovement but embryonic plans whereby, eventually, may come release and theculture and civilisation of the New Age. If you are seeking to bringillumination into the dark places of the earth (which means into the minds ofmen), then you must yourselves see clearly and relate the abstract and theconcrete in such a manner that, in your own lives, a working idealism may beseen; only so can a working idealism of a national, racial and human nature alsobe seen. The head as well as the heart must be used, and this many earnestpeople are apt to forget. Can you possibly work at high tension in thisendeavour—a tension produced by the interrelation of the head and the heart,working out creatively through the [74] throat centre, esoterically understood?In this last sentence I have expressed for disciples the nature of the effortthey need to make.It is in the recognition of what is happening to mankind as a whole and behindthe scenes, that the thinkers of the world and the New Group of World Serverscan best serve; it is the unfoldment of the human consciousness in response tothe presented conditions in any country or countries that is of moment; the“human state of mind” is just beginning to focus itself on the things thatmatter and to express itself in a living fashion. The thinkers and servers mustlearn to concentrate upon the awakening consciousness and not upon thesuperficial movements. This awakening goes on apace and, my brothers,satisfactorily. The form or forms may suffer but the intrinsic awareness of manis becoming, during this century, expressively divine.The two other forces which tend to increase the already prevalent tension in theworld are:4. The forces of materialism, streaming out into the three worlds from theso-called “Dark Forces” or Black Lodge, and from those groups of lives andworkers which are the antithesis of the Great White Lodge.5. The force emanating from that section of humanity which is found in everypart of the world and which we call the Jewish people. What I say here has nospecific reference to any individual; I am considering the world problem,centering around the Jews as a whole.These two forces greatly complicate the problem by which humanity and theHierarchy are faced, but it should be remembered that they also produce thatbalancing which is ever needed for the production of right conditions.There is little that I can tell you about the Dark Forces. They are not theproblems of humanity but that of the Hierarchy. The task of these Forces is thepreservation of the form life and the working out of methods and aims which areinherent in the processes of manifestation. The Black Lodge, so-called, isoccupied with the form aspect of [75] manifestation; the White Lodge, with theconsciousness aspect. It might, therefore, be stated that:1. Shamballa is occupied with the life aspect in its graded impulses.2. The Hierarchy is occupied with the consciousness aspect in its graded seriesof expansions.3. The Black Lodge is occupied with the matter aspect in its multiplicity offorms.Again, light may come to you, if you relate this triple statement to the threesolar systems and to the three aspects of divinity. Evil or wrong, therefore,exists only when the emphasis is retained in the wrong aspect from the point ofview of the unfoldment attained or when that which has been used and developedto the necessary point, holds the life or consciousness too long. Hence, mybrothers, the beneficent nature of death.The Forces of Darkness are powerful energies, working to preserve that which isancient and material; hence they are pre-eminently the forces ofcrystallisation, of form preservation, of the attractiveness of matter, and ofthe lure of that which is existent in the form life of the three worlds. Theyconsequently block deliberately the inflow of that which is new and life-giving;they work to prevent the understanding of that which is of the New Age; theyendeavour to preserve that which is familiar and old, to counteract the effectsof the oncoming culture and civilisation, to bring blindness to the peoples andto feed steadily the existing fires of hate, of separateness, of criticism andof cruelty. These forces, as far as the intelligent peoples of the world areconcerned, work insidiously and cloak their effort in fair words, leading evendisciples to express hatred of persons and ideologies, fostering the hiddenseeds of hatred found in many human beings. They fan to fury the fear and hateof the world in an effort to preserve that which is old and make the unknownappear undesirable, and they hold back the forces of evolution and of progressfor their own ends. These [76] ends are as inscrutable to you as are the plansof the Ruler of Shamballa.These are forces which it is well for you to recognise as existing, but there islittle that you, as individuals or as groups, can do about them beyond seeing toit that there is nothing in you which could make you—unimportant as you are—afocal point for their efforts or an agent for the distribution of their peculiartype of energy—the energy of focussed and directed hate, of separation, of fearand pride. With them we who are connected directly with the Hierarchy have todeal, but you can aid more than you know through the regulation of thoughts andideas, through the cultivation of a loving spirit and through the general use ofthe Great Invocation.We come now, for a brief moment, to a consideration of the Jewish question.Remember that it is an interesting fact that the Jews are found in every landwithout exception, that their influence is potent and widespread (far more sothan they themselves are willing to recognise), and that they wield mostpotently that peculiar concretisation of energy which we call money. Theyconstitute, in a strange manner, a unique and distinctly separated world centreof energy. The reason for this is that they represent the energy and the life ofthe previous solar system. You have often been told how, at the close of thissolar system, a certain percentage of the human family will fail to make thegrade and will then be held in pralaya, or in solution, until the time for themanifestation of the next and third solar system comes around. Then they willconstitute the advanced guard and the symbol of the coming humanity of thatsystem. The same thing occurred in the system before this one and those whom wenow call the Jews (a purely modern name and distinction, as I tried to show inthe last few pages of A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. I, Esoteric Psychology), are the descendants of that earlier group which was held in pralaya betweenthe first and second solar systems. If you will remember that the third raygoverned that system and also governs the Jewish race, if you bear in mind thatthat system was occupied with [77] the divine aspects of matter only and withexternal conditions, and that the Jews were the highest product of that systemyou can come to an understanding of the Jew, his separateness, his desire forracial purity and his interest in that which is commercial and tangible. TheJew, down the ages, has insisted upon being separated from all other races buthe brought over from the previous system the knowledge (necessary then butobsolete now) that his race was the “chosen people.” The “Wandering Jew” haswandered from System One to this where he must learn the lesson of absorptionand cease his wandering. He has insisted upon racial purity, for that was hismajor problem in early Lemurian times when the race came into a world that hadin it no human beings, for it was before the coming of the Lords of Flame; thisinsistence has been carried down the ages and has governed the rules of marriageand the preparation of food instead of being dropped (as it should have been)thousands of years ago. It is these facts (unknown to the modern Jew) which hasmilitated against him down the years and made it possible for the forces ofseparativeness and of hate, to use the Jewish race to stir up world difficulty,and thus bring to a crisis the basic human problem of separation. When humanityhas solved the Jewish problem (with the understanding cooperation of the Jew)and overcome ancient antipathies and hatreds, it will do so by fusing theproblem in one vast humanitarian situation. When that happens, the problem willbe rapidly solved and one of the major difficulties will disappear off the faceof the earth. Racial fusion will then be possible. Our earth humanity and thegroup of human beings who are far more ancient in their origin than we are, willform one humanity and then there will be peace on earth.Why our planet and this solar system should have been constituted the nurseryfor the seeds of separativeness and why this remnant of humanity, far moreadvanced than ours, should have been destined to work out its future on ourearth, is hid in the knowledge of the Lord of Shamballa, and is unattainableknowledge for you and, indeed, for many [78] in the Hierarchy. It is simply afact to be accepted by you. The solution will come, as I said, when the racesregard the Jewish problem as a humanitarian problem but also when the Jew doeshis share of understanding, love and right action. This he does not yet do,speaking racially. He must let go of his own separative tendencies and of hisdeep sense of persecution. He will do this latter with great facility, when hegrasps, as a race, the significance and inevitability of the Law of Karma, andfrom a close study of the Old Testament and of the acts and deeds there claimedby him as his racial acts and deeds (conquest, terrorism and cruelty), realisesthat the law is working out and incidentally releasing him for a greater future.There must, at the same time, be a realisation by the Jew and Gentile of equalresponsibility and equal liability for the present world difficulty.The two forces to which I have been referring must, therefore, be taken intoaccount by all disciples as they seek to serve in this critical cycle; these twoforces must also be taken into your calculations as you start this new groupwork or your wrong idealisms and thoughts may hinder the group work. You mustrecognise theoretically the five forces (three major and two minor) which meetand clash in the human family at this time. It has been necessary for me tobring these facts to your attention. If disciples are to do group work togetheron mental levels, they must clear their minds of prejudice, hatreds and anytendency to superiority and criticism. You cannot work, as a group, if theseideas and thoughts are present, and I am preparing now to teach you some of thefirst stages of group work and usefulness. It would not have been necessary forme to deal with these world problems if you had been immune from emotionalreactions to them, but very few of you have your minds clear from prejudice andfree from hatred. Those few make the work possible and it is also possible forthe rest of you to detach your minds from undue influence and wrong ideas.I ask you, in this work, to concentrate upon the Shamballa and the Hierarchicalforces. I ask you to regard yourselves [79] as pure and unclogged channels andto seek only to be linked with the soul of each and all, whose nature is purelove, realised synthesis and divine potency.It is essential, however, in spite of the work to which I have called thesegroups and which—as you know—is intended to lay the basis for the work of theesoteric schools of the future, that the members of all the groups realise thatexoteric group work must also be undertaken. Too many in these groups aresatisfied with the significance of their own group work and permit it to usurpthe place of objective service.If it is so hard, my brothers, to arouse aspirants, such as yourselves, tourgent service and a full sense of responsibility; if men and women with all theinformation that you possess cannot be aroused to sacrificing effort, you cangain some idea of the magnitude of the task with which the Hierarchy isconfronted at this time. You can realise, perhaps, the sense almost offrustration which could sweep over me (if I were limited by any time concept)when, for instance, those to whom I look for cooperation, are preoccupied withtheir own affairs, have no sense of immediacy and prefer to concentrate upontheir own development, their own families, their own problems, rather thanachieve the larger world view which would lead to full cooperation. The avertingof a world debacle is the aim of our effort and towards this aim I have askedyour help.~THE SPIRITUAL TREND OF HUMAN DESTINYWesak, May 1939In this hour of crisis, anxiety and suspense, it has seemed that there arecertain things which you would do well to remember, and certain things which youshould endeavour to do.The first thing, therefore, of which I would like to remind you is that TheHierarchy stands . Behind all that is going on today, the same group ofspiritual Forces and the [80] same Elder Brothers and Masters are to be found asheretofore, guiding humanity along the path of life and bringing us safely andsatisfactorily to our present point of development. The Buddha, Whose festivalwe are celebrating, and the Christ, Who expresses to us the unchanging love ofGod, are still with us, and the Hierarchy stands as a bulwark of strengthbetween us and possible disaster; this centre of spiritual life is “like theshadow of a great rock in a weary land”.The second thing I would have you all remember is that mankind has marchedsteadily forward from a state of blind ignorance and unawareness to one of anintelligent preoccupation with life and a growing sense of responsibility. Thissense of responsibility, which is awakening in all of you, is—on its presentlarge scale—relatively new and is one of the factors definitely increasing thedistress and pain you are all feeling. You ask yourselves, where, as a race,have we failed and what can we do to rectify our mistakes? In spite ofeverything, however, men have gone from stage to stage of intelligent andspiritual unfoldment and no matter what the outer happenings have been or maybe, the race has made real progress. There has been no turning back, and therewill be none. Mankind has weathered many storms and survived many difficulties;men have emerged from periods of crisis better and stronger, purified “so as byfire” and definitely nearer the goal.I would remind you also of the integrity and solidarity of the human family. Weare one people—one in our relationships, and capacities and desires, our originand our goal. It is this essential and recognisable integrity which is emergingat this time powerfully in the human consciousness. You are apt to think thatthis may not be so, that your position in believing this is somewhat unique andthat you stand somewhat alone. But this is your error and is not true to thefacts of the case. In every land and among widely differing peoples, the samedesire exists for understanding, for the establishing of right and peacefulrelations, and for the [81] expression of that basic goodwill which is one ofthe deepest human characteristics and our divine inheritance.These are the things which, it seems to me, are important at this time, andwhich all of us would do well to remember. Will you try to do so? No matter whatmay take place in the world—whether war or peace, strife and aggression orunderstanding conciliation and conference—we face a difficult period ofadjustment, and for this we must be prepared. The next three years are critical,and this we have often been told.Much will depend upon what you and all men of goodwill and disciples think andwhat they do. I would like to remind you of another most encouraging thing, andthat is that the power wielded by those who are seeking to live as souls and intouch with the soul and the world of spiritual realities is out of allproportion to their registered sense of power and usefulness. You are, as youendeavour to wield spiritual force constructively and selflessly, far morepotent than you realise. If you add to this realisation the recognition that youare not alone in this, but that people with a vision similar to yours and withthe same ideals and spiritual aspiration are to be found in every countrywithout exception of any kind, in every religion, group and organisation, thenindeed you can go forward with courage and with hopeful faith. If this is astatement of fact (and I believe it to be so) then let us go forward in unisonwith our brothers everywhere, conscious of opportunity, of strength, ofresponsibility and of the joy of service.As regards some of the things which you can do, I would suggest the following.Refuse to allow yourselves to be swept by any fear psychosis or to be stampededinto any attitude through which the anxiety and unrest and distress in the worldcan overwhelm you. Strive to stand in spiritual being. Each morning, in yourmeditation, seek to take that attitude with a new and fresh definiteness and tohold it during the hours of service which lie ahead each day. This will not bean easy thing to do, but it can be done if you can get quiet enough for fiveminutes each morning—completely [82] and interiorly quiet—and if you fill yourdays with vital occupation and true service, guarding with care all thought andspeech.Between now and the Wesak Festival in 1940 let each of you gain that control ofspeech which has often been your goal but seldom your achievement, and rememberthat the most powerful factor in the control of speech is a loving heart. Wildand fearful talk, hateful gossip, cruel innuendo, suspicion, the ascribing ofwrong and wicked motives to persons and peoples, and the divergences of attitudewhich have separated the many different nations in the world are rampant todayand have brought the world to its present distressing situation. It is so easyto drift into the same habits of speech and thought which we find around us andto discover ourselves participating in attack and the spirit of hate. Guardyourselves strenuously against this and say nothing which could inflame hate andsuspicion in connection with any race, any person, any group or any leaders ofgroups and nations. You will have to guard yourselves with care, so that even indefense of that which you may personally or nationally approve you do not findyourselves full of hate and breaking the law of love—the only law which cantruly save the world. Perhaps the key to your success along this line will bethe silence of a loving heart.It will be good also to cultivate the joy that brings strength. This is not thetime for gloom, despair or depression. If you give way to these, you becomenegative and destructive focal points in your environment. If you truly believethat the spiritual life is fundamental in the world today, if you do believethat divinity guides the world, if you truly grasp the fact that all men areyour brothers and that we are all the children of the One Father, and if you areconvinced that the heart of humanity is sound—are these not adequately potentideas to hold us joyously steady in the midst of a changing world?Will you, therefore, carry with you the following ideas?First, that the Hierarchy of spiritual Forces stands in spiritual Being.[83] Second, that we too can stand steady in spiritual Being.Third, that the silence of a loving heart should be our keynote for the comingyear.Fourth, that strength to stand is the result of a joyous attitude and a trueorientation to the soul.~CONFLICT BETWEEN FORCES OF ANCIENT ORIGINAugust 1939I have already written anent the fivefold stream of energy which is today inconflict with world forces or with the forces of light or darkness, so called.(I would remind you that there would be no darkness without the light and nolight without the dark. Ponder on this.) I would ask you to realise that theorganised efforts of the Great White Lodge are directed toward lifting theorganised forces of materialism to a higher and spiritual plane. Today, gold andseparativeness, materialism and selfishness are in conflict with spiritualenergy and with the spirit of cooperation or understanding fusion. The law whichwill determine the results can be expressed in the words that have been oftenused: by holding, man loses; by relinquishing, he gains; by seeking to graspthat which he has, it must and will inevitably disappear. Reflect upon this law.The method whereby the forces of separation and of selfishness work are bycompetitive cooperation. Throughout the world, groups are already formed (or arein process of forming) to bring about the attainment of various materialisticgoals, the achievement of personal or national ambitions, and the imposition ofintellectual plans and concepts (the so-called ideologies) upon the mass of thepeople. Parties, organisations, groups, societies, associations and alliancesexist for the furtherance of political and sociological aims and to carryforward the projects of many peoples and the many and differing points of view,plus the many attitudes toward life and its arrangement and re-arrangement. I amnot here dealing with the churches, the [84] great religions or the religiousorganisations. I am concerned with the determining factors which are todayconditioning the material life of the planet. Speaking broadly, these forces andgroups are occupied with material values and mental ideas. They are notprincipally occupied with the more subtle values, though these are incidentallypresent. The emphasis is upon the economic situation; upon the possession ofland or cultural predispositions and tendencies and with the relations betweenpeople and nations; these latter are based fundamentally, as you know, on thatwhich is tangible and objective, guarded, defended or gained and procured bydefinitely tangible means which are in themselves separative and divided. Thisstatement, I think, the people of every nation would regard as true. The basicunderlying methods employed are those of organisational arrangement (large, asin nations, or smaller, as in the groups within the nations), propaganda, theimposition of favoured ideas through the use of the spoken and written word inevery country, group loyalty, group adherence to the leader, and group methods.Success depends upon the gained group cohesion, the group willingness tosacrifice, plus loyalty and allegiance to some directing personality.Behind these many groups stand the forces of ancient origin which are pledgedeither to the material or the spiritual values. Because many ages have gone byin the building up of the material values, to the development of the personalityconsciousness, and to the achievement of a tangible and objective civilisation,the forces of materialism are apparently far stronger and more potent than theforces of the spirit or of the intangible worlds. Up to the present this has notbeen wrong, though it has been accompanied by much that has been undesirable andwhich has led to a one-sided evolution. But the time has now come for the shiftof the human consciousness into the world of true and spiritual understandingand of the intangible and more desirable standards of living.Pouring through the chaos of offensive and defensive groups and through the manywarring organisations (political [85] for the most part, or religious), andaffecting both the reactionary bodies and those who stand for the new ideals andthe coming civilisation and culture, are the five streams abovementioned—streams of energy.At this point I would remind you that the effect of the impact of energy isdependent upon the nature of the vehicle of response. According to his equipmentand the nature of his bodies, so will man react to the inflowing energies. Thisis a fundamental statement. It is a law and should be most carefully considered.The effects of a Master or initiate upon men are widely different, because eachman brings to the impact of His vibration a type of physical body, an astral oremotional nature, and a mind which are in each case different from all theothers. The use each makes of the stimulating energy will be different; thefocus of his consciousness is very different; his type of mind is quitedifferent; his centres, their activity and their internal organisation aredifferent. And it is the same for groups, organisations and nations.Nations, for instance, have seven centres, as have all forms of existence fromthe human and animal upwards, and it is an interesting study to discover thesecentres and note the type of energy which flows through them. In connection withthe United States of America, Chicago is the solar plexus centre, whilst NewYork is the throat centre and Washington the head centre. The heart centre isLos Angeles. The heart centre of Germany is Munich, and its head centre isNuremberg, whilst Berlin is the throat centre. London is, of course, the heartcentre for Great Britain (and temporarily it is also the head centre, thoughthis will not always be the case), whilst Ottawa is the throat centre and Sydneyis the solar plexus centre of the British Empire. Some day I may indicate to youthe centres through which the forces of manifestation have to work for thevarious nations. This information constitutes one of the major hierarchicalsciences and indicates to us who know it the possibilities latent in any nation,the point of attainment and the opportunities for work and advancement, or theobstacles [86] to progress; this is gauged by the light in the centres and theheightening and the obscuration of their vibration. It is this that makespossible or hinders the growth of what is called spirituality in individuals andin nations, and this science will later be recognised. It is by means of thisscience that the Hierarchy can form its larger plans and know in what mannerindividual nations will react to stimulation and to progress of the desiredkind. This is the modern form of the ancient Atlantean laya-yoga, or the yoga ofthe centres.According, therefore, to the condition of the sensitive bodies of the planet, ofnations and of individuals, so will be their reaction to the five kinds ofinflowing forces. The Shamballa force, for instance, in making its impact uponfirst ray types, and upon the other ray types on that line of major energy—thethird, fifth and seventh ray types—evokes widely differing results than when itmakes an impact upon the second ray line of energy; the results of the impact ofShamballa energy upon the first ray individuals and nations can be potent in theextreme. This impact, being relatively a new one to humanity, evokes in theworld today all the political and organisational changes which are so prevalentand so disturbing. There is little that humanity can do about this exceptendeavour to balance this first ray display of energy with second ray orhierarchical force. This latter energy—working through the world religions andthe men and women who respond to the love influence—can change methods (thoughnot the purpose or the direction) by pouring in the love force.Again, that force which we regard as emanating from the strictly human centre,the third ray type of energy, is of the third or creative order; and in thesethree energies you have, in reality, the expression of the three major centresof the planetary Logos. The first or will energy is, as you know, focussed inSanat Kumara, the Ancient of Days (as He is called in the Christian Bible), theLord of Shamballa, Who is the embodiment of the Personality of the planetaryLogos. The love force is focussed through the two great spiritual Lords of theHierarchy, the Buddha and the [87] Christ, Who are both embodiments of the heartcentre of the planetary Logos, for the Buddha represents the twelve-petalledlotus in the head, of which the Christ represents the counterpart, thetwelve-petalled lotus of the heart centre. This is a fact seldom grasped or evenmentioned. The petals of the throat centre are represented at this time bycertain of the leading world rulers, whose activity is responsible for the rapidcreation of the new world with its rapidly altering civilisations and culture.These thoughts will provide much that you would do well to consider.The fourth type of force, which is responsible for the state of world affairs atthis time, is that of the Jews; they, as a whole, constitute the solar plexus ofthe planetary Logos; their problem is being used today to focus, qualify andcondition the world feeling-nature and the emotional reactions of the sensitivenature of humanity and of the planetary Logos. Forget not that the Personalityof our planetary Logos is not yet perfect, hence the fact that His body ofmanifestation, the planet, is not reckoned as being one of the sacred planets.Through the Jewish people throughout the world, feeling—sympathetic orantagonistic, expressive of love or conditioned by hate—is being gathered to afocus in the planetary solar plexus centre, preparatory to a great and permanentchange. It is for this reason that I have said to some of my pupils that whenhumanity will have solved correctly the Jewish problem, and when it has beenresolved in a humanitarian and sound manner, then the energy of the planetarysolar plexus centre will have been raised to the heart and a great transmutationwill have taken place.The Dark or Materialistic Forces correspond in their entirety to the energies ofthe sacral centre of the planet, dealing with the generation of forms, and theirwork is to keep the direction of planetary interest upon the form side of divineexpression. They are concerned with the life of matter itself, with its magicalusage, and with that which is regarded as dark because, for humanity at itspresent stage of development, that divine aspect should have lost its major [88]hold and should lie behind “in the darkness of that which has been outgrown andwhich has no further hold upon the son of God”. You therefore have the followingtabulation expressing what I have sought above to make clear to you.I would point out here that the fourth energy, focussed in the Jewish problem,is definitely producing cleavage as a part of the divine plan. The Jews areinstruments in the working out of the Plan for the production of certainsyntheses and to bring humanity to certain realisations and decisions. A closestudy of this tabulation will bring you much of knowledge. However, it onlyexpresses the present situation in this interim period between the old Pisceanage which is passing and the new Aquarian age which is coming in. It depictsthis present world cycle. The emphasis of the rays changes in connection withthe last two types of energy expressions quite constantly, because they aresymbolic (in this day and age) of the personality nature in its physical andemotional forms.I wonder whether you can grasp the implications of this paragraph. When the mindaspect (the third aspect of the personality) is more fully developed, then thefocus of the effort of the Dark Forces will change and the problem of the Jewswill disappear. Mankind is not yet handling its problems intelligently. Thus theforces and energies of the creative process are exceedingly active at this timein preparing what I might call the “material of the world” and the substance ofall the four kingdoms in nature for the coming changes. As the ploughman turnsthe soil of his field and harrows it, and so brings that which is underneath toeventual fruition, so a similar process is taking place in the world today, andall is preparatory for the sowing and its resultant effects. These effects willconstitute the new Aquarian culture and civilisation. In this process theHierarchy is taking a definite and influential part and is working more uniquelyand specifically than ever before in the history of the world, under instructionand vital aid from Shamballa.[89]I.

Mind[90] Seed groups are in process of being “esoterically anchored” in the field ofthe world, having in them those who can respond to the subtler forces and whocan—through the strength of their clear thought at this stage of theproceedings—produce those conditions (within the present existing world trendsand world groups) which will enable the new sciences, the new approaches todivinity, the new education, and the new modes of handling the economicsituation and the political problems, to precipitate and further the growth ofthe Kingdom of God in such a manner that this fifth kingdom in nature may be atangible, factual and objective occurrence upon the Earth.In the founding of the fourth kingdom in nature, the human kingdom, the processis spoken of in the ancient books and archives in the library of the Hierarchyin the following terms which are (some of them) paraphrased and expanded in TheSecret Doctrine:“Seven men appeared, the prisoners of the Prajapatis and the prisoners also ofthe earthly Barhishads... Seven men of seven colours... Seven men, each on hisown lot and related to the eighth. They spoke and knew each other. They saw andthey desired that which then appeared. They sensed the first, the second and thethird. They were themselves the fourth, but of the fifth they had as yet noknowledge for they were prisoners of the world and the fifth could not appear.The fires which were forty-nine in number proceeded then to do their work, andthe prison bars grew firm as steel... But time persisted and the seven—each onhis own lot—began to grow too large for the confining bars.”This parable will be apparent to esotericists. The clue to what I have to saycomes later in the same ancient writing, and here I will roughly paraphrase orfreely translate it for you.“The seven—each on his own lot—acquired knowledge. The knowledge was the same,but the soil within [91] the lots differed. Nevertheless, the goal of reachingtowards the heavens was the same as in the second (a reference to the vegetablekingdom and its symbolically skyward aspiration)... No further do they reach.Upon the lot of each, nine points of light appear, reflected in the heavens;they brought to seeding point that human seed which has within it that which isnot of man. The light produced the germination and thus the new and better formsof life. And yet the form remains and yet its quality is changed. (I can find nobetter word than `quality’ wherewith to translate the ancient symbol). Somethings are lost and disappear and rightly so. Some newer modes of life and whatlife builds appear, and thus the fifth is seen on earth like to the second andnurtured by the fourth. Within it are the one, the two, the three and then thefifth. And thus the glory of the One is seen.”One meaning is obvious if you study with care the implications and relate it tothe kingdoms of nature. There are of course several meanings to these ancientwritings.I have referred above to the five streams of energy and have related them to thefive centres. Let me extend the idea somewhat by pointing out that these fiveenergies are related to the centres or the lotuses to which I referred in ATreatise on Cosmic Fire, or to the dynamic point within the lotus, through whichthe central life of the lotus flows; in the case of the first three energies (ofShamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity) you have the permanent point of life,light and activity in the lotus; in the case of that potent energy connectedwith the Jews, you have a very temporary inflow of energy, and in the case ofthe Forces of Materialism, you have a relatively temporary—though apparentlypermanent—focal point of reactionary energy.In connection with the petals of the lotus, you will find a close connectionwith the forces of the five kingdoms in nature; therefore, to the tabulationwhich was earlier given I would add the following for your consideration: [92]1. 5th Kingdom Intuition spiritual soul head centre 2. 4th Kingdom Intelligencehuman soul throat centre 3. 3rd Kingdom Instinct animal soul solar plexus 4. 2ndKingdom Sentiency feeling consciousness heart centre 5. 1st Kingdom Responsesub-consciousness base of spineTo this you may add the following:1. Shamballa Head Lotus Kingdom of God 1st Ray Will Quality of Will 2. HierarchyHeart Centre Kingdom of Souls 2nd Ray Love Quality of Giving .. Love 3. HumanityThroat Centre Kingdom of man 4th Ray Harmony through Conflict Quality ofAcquisitiveness 4. The Jews Solar Plexus Centre Kingdom of man 3rd Ray ActiveIntelligence Quality of Separativeness[93] These can be linked up with the kingdoms in nature, but in this particularcycle it is not possible to fit them in such a way that the correspondence willappear to you as accurate. The mineral kingdom and the Forces of Materialism donot really coincide today, for the one works through the sacral centre at thistime, and the other through the centre at the base of the spine. Esotericstudents must always remember that no correspondences are correct and entirelyaccurate in their parallelism in this solar system of changing forces, shiftingcycles and constant mutation directed towards the inscrutable ends ofDeity—inscrutable as far as the human consciousness is concerned. They remaininscrutable to humanity, because the three major ends or purposes which affectyou, for instance, as members of the fourth kingdom in nature are:1. The direction in which the solar Logos is going upon the Cosmic Path.Esoterically . . . . . . The Way towards the Central Spiritual Sun.2. The plans of the planetary Logos upon the Systemic Path.Esoterically . . . . . . The Way towards the Heart of the Sun.3. The purpose ahead for the human family upon the Path of Light.Esoterically . . . . . . The Way of the Sun.I put this in here only to show you how vague and uncertain are your veryhighest speculations. Be content with your duty and the immediate service whichwill lead you a step further upon the way to which you are ordained, and thisway you can travel rapidly and with eager feet or slowly and with lagging steps.The above enumerated forces are, however, part of the temporary interlocking ofenergies which is going on between the many expressions of the creative processat this time. They are likewise conditioned by the incoming Aquarian force and“measured” by the outgoing Piscean forces. I [94] would have you note here myuse of the word “forces” and “force,” for not idly have I made them singular andplural.In this process of founding the kingdom of heaven upon earth, the same procedureis being followed as was used in the earlier stage of founding the fourthkingdom. The “seven men, each on his own lot,” reach a moment of tension and ofcreative power wherein the seeds of life, which they contain within themselves,can come to fruition, and groups of such appearing seeds can appear in the world“on their own lot.” Putting it more simply and in terms symbolic, and thereforemore easy of understanding, we might state that the seven rays, expressingthemselves in the human family through the seven ray types, are now at the stageof unfoldment where the process can be carried forward into the formation of theseven ray groups, and these in their totality will express the Kingdom of God.Groups will be formed which will be outstandingly of a particular ray type butwhich will work in all the nine major fields of human expression. These Ioutlined when indicating the work of the nine groups planned by me. However, letme here point out that the groups which I planned are not in themselves thecoming groups nor are they the only evidences of the emergence of these raygroups in the world. There are several similar experiments going on at this timeupon the various streams of ray energy and under the direction of variousMasters of the Wisdom. The groups for which I have made myself responsible aresecond ray groups essentially and are in the nature of a tentative move to seeif the time is really ripe for the distribution of such seed groups throughoutthe entire world. Will the response of humanity and the reaction of these groupsbe such that a network of them may be started on a large scale everywhere—groupswhich will be characterised by vision, cohesion, love, impersonality, sacrifice,persistency and creative ability? These are the questions which we, the teacherson the inner side, are today asking ourselves as we study the problem of thebest way of helping the human family through this crisis.Bear in mind that the objective before these groups is [95] to relate theHierarchy, and that for which it stands, to humanity; to bring into a closerapport the two centres whose energy must eventually be fused and blended intoone whole. Perhaps you will grasp the underlying idea with greater clarity ifyou will remember the personal work which you should be endeavouring to do withyourself. This is, is it not, the effort to fuse and blend the personality andthe soul, or the higher Self and the lower selves. To do this you have torealise that the illumination of the mind is a vital and essential factor. Thereare, therefore, three points to consider: the Soul, the illumined Mind and thePersonality. To these three you have to add a consecrated and awakened heart,full of love to all, vibrant with compassion and with understanding. Bear,therefore, these four factors in mind:1. The dedicated oriented man . . . . . . the personality2. The overshadowing, spiritual man . . .the soul3. The illumined mind . . . . . . . . . . . . .the medium of relation4. The consecrated, loving heart . . . . the expression of these three.This is the personality and individual correspondence to the broader picture andthe world factors and the wider undertakings with which humanity is at this timefaced. Just as in the life of the individual a man is confronted with theopportunity to function as a disciple in training with a view to initiation, sotoday humanity is faced in the same way with a similar situation andpossibilities. The higher correspondence with which the Hierarchy is occupied atthis time, and of which the outline just given is an inadequate analogy, is asfollows:1. The intellectual centre, Humanity, receptive, ready and expectant.2. The spiritual centre, the Hierarchy, positive, deliberate andmunificent—ready and waiting to bestow that which is desired, reached for andclaimed. [96]3. The New Group of World Servers. They are the more advanced members of thehuman family, sensitive to hierarchical inspiration and to human need and tospiritual unfoldment as a determining factor in world affairs.4. Small groups which correspond to the illumined minds of theindividuals—intuitional and acting as a cohesive element and a fusing factorbetween humanity and the Hierarchy. They are gathered out of the New Group ofWorld Servers.Let me now present you with another vital consideration. Looking back over yourindividual lives, you will be conscious that it was the points of crisis and thecycles of tension which constituted for you the major opportunities and themoments of “moving forward.” Of these opportunities you either profited or—byneglecting them—you temporarily failed. This same critical factor (if I mightcall it so) acts also in the world of men and in groups and masses; today thepoint of tension for humanity in such a situation, similar to that to be foundin the individual life, can be noted. The Hierarchy stands also at a point ofextreme and scientific tension—scientific because induced and directed; you can,if you so choose, picture these two great groups as facing each other. TheHierarchy is aware of the need, of the purpose of the dual tension, and desirousof bringing this tension to such a “crisis of precipitation” that the fusion ofthe two groups will be inevitable, whilst the other group, humanity, unawaregenerally of the implications of the situation, is suffering, bewildered andfull of fear. Between these two groups stands the New Group of World Servers,constituted today of two bodies of people:1. Those who are aware of the Plan, are subject to and sensitive to hierarchicalimpression and dedicated to the task of bringing about the desired fusion orgroup at-one-ment. These are the consecrated servers of the world who are freefrom all taint of separativeness, full of love to all men and eager for the [97]spread of understanding goodwill. They correspond to the “consecrated lovingheart,” mentioned above.2. A small minority who have emerged out of the New Group of World Servers andwho can (in every country) function in group formation if they choose, and sobring about the fusion for which the New Group of World Servers is working andfor which the point of tension in humanity and in the Hierarchy predisposes andhas prepared the hearts of men. Their opportunity and responsibility is great,because they know the Plan, they are in touch with the guiding teachers on theinner side—and are sensitive to the higher impression. They correspond to thepoints of illumination, and so to the “illumined minds,” referred to above.Here is the picture of these esoteric interrelations, and here you can note theposition which you could hold, for these groups have a definite opportunity tobring about this world fusion and so precipitate the “crisis of love” to which Ihave so oft referred. The Great Approach upon the side of humanity is now goingon, with the tension induced thereby growing momentarily; this will increasewith growing speed and tension until 1942 when either the first stage of fusionwill have been made upon earth, resulting in widespread goodwill and worldunderstanding or in postponement—with sad results to the human family and aninevitable break in the tension which will take a form that will cause much realsuffering and widespread disaster. This disaster can take many forms, but uponthem we will not speculate, except to realise the urgency and the need forimmediate action which is demanded at this time.There are two points to remember in connection with these seed groups, and theseare in line with, but also expansions of, analogous conditions in the “seeds”which fructified—after implantation and development—in animal-man, producing theliving self-conscious individual and, in [98] their totality, the fourth kingdomin nature. The first point has reference to the quality of the implanted seed,and the second to the method of its implantation.The quality of the “seed of the sons of God” which was effectual in producingthe human family was intellectual, and the self-conscious self-directed man wasthe result. The fruit of this quality, plus the livingness of the seed itself,can be seen today in the more advanced and cultured thinking people and in thosewho are in any sense of the word personalities.The method employed was the gift of mind to the more advanced among theanimal-men in a majority of cases, the stimulation of the instinctual faculty inothers, whilst a third method was the leaving of a minority to the ordinarycourse of evolution. These latter today constitute the least developed and themost backward of the races upon the Earth. They are, in fact, a very smallnumber indeed.In connection with the “seed-groups” which are fusing and blending in humanityat this time, and which—in their totality—constitute the nucleus of the fifthkingdom, the distinguishing quality is the ability to respond intuitionally tohigher impression and to present the mind (with which humanity was endowed inthe earlier process) to the light of the intuition and hence to illumination.This intuition is a blend of the two divine qualities of buddhi-manas, orintuitive spiritual understanding (involving interpretation and identification)and the higher abstract mind, which is essentially the power to comprehend thatwhich is not concrete or tangible but which is, in reality, an innaterecognition of the lower aspects of the divine Plan as it must affect life inthe three worlds. Humanity, being still primarily self-conscious andself-centred, regards this Plan as the divine Plan for man, but—as the seedgroups grow and develop—the narrowness of this partial view will becomeincreasingly apparent. God’s Plan is all-embracing and His purposes areinclusive of all forms of life and their relationships. This quality of the seedgroups is described in current esoteric literature as love-wisdom (the heartnature and the higher [99] mind), and this is descriptive of the future groups;it is not love, however, as usually understood, or wisdom as man generallydefines it. This is free of emotion and of the astralism which is distinctive ofthe solar plexus life which most people live; love, esoterically and in reality,is perceptive understanding, the ability to recognise that which has produced anexisting situation, and a consequent freedom from criticism; it involves thatbeneficent silence which carries healing in its wings and which is onlyexpressive when the inhibition aspect of silence is absent and the man no longerhas to still his lower nature and quiet the voices of his own ideas in order tounderstand and achieve identification with that which must be loved. Can youfollow the beauty of this concept and comprehend the nature of this silent depthof true understanding?Wisdom is the sublimation of the intellect, but this involves the sublimation ofthe higher as well as of the lower aspects of the mind. It is a blend ofintuition, spiritual perception, cooperation with the plan and spontaneousintellectual appreciation of that which is contacted, and all this is fused andblended with and by the love which I have defined above, plus that esotericsense which must be unfolded before the second initiation can be taken. I callthis especially to your attention. Seek to understand and perceive the subtleevidences of the esoteric sense, and then define it and explain its processesand evidences, invoking as you do so the higher sensibilities.And now, as to the methods to be employed in creating these groups. The primarymethod is the presentation of the more advanced ideas (which are stimulating intheir effects upon the minds which are receptive) and the presentation of thevision, which is evocative in its influence and produces amazing results. Ponderon this.The basic method employed, which lay behind the three methods outlined in TheSecret Doctrine and referred to above, was the presentation (very dimly andvaguely) of the concept of the self, of the lower integrated self and itscorrelated inner implications of self-centredness and self-direction. [100] Thepresentation made today to self-conscious man and to this self-directedindividual is the revelation of the larger Whole of which the individual is apart. To this Whole the self must dedicate its life, love and light. Those arethe three gifts which the fourth kingdom in nature has finally and consciouslyto make to the planet—gifts of definitely directed energies producing peculiarand equally definite relations of forces; they are not the gift of strength,kindness and knowledge, which is man’s feeble interpretation of the divineenergies with which he will some day salvage the planetary life.The presentation of this vision to the aspirants and disciples of the world hashad a dual effect; first of all, it has produced an immediate responsivecohesion among them which resulted in the appearance of the New Group of WorldServers, and secondly, it led to the formation along the line of the seven raysthroughout the world of small groups (within the New Group of World Servers) whowere dedicated to the production of this innate synthesis and subjective fusionand to the expression of this blended dedicated consciousness. These lattergroups, a small minority, correspond to the earlier and first method ofmind-implantation in animal man, whilst the New Group of World Serverscorresponds to the second method of general stimulation.In both of these embryonic activities, which will eventually be responsible forproducing the manifestation of the Kingdom of God on earth, the two greatnecessities are vision, plus living organisation. The vision has to be sensed,sought and discovered individually by each group member, and it is this personalknowledge and this personal dedication to the revelation which leads next to theorganisation of the group life and relation, or to a determined process ofcorrelation with the life and purpose of the Whole. The individual who has forhimself seen the vision relates himself to the group which is conscious of thisvision along with him, and then follows the relating of this “visioning group”to the kingdom of God as it exists on the subtler planes, in the effort toexteriorise it and make the vision a fact upon the [101] plane of manifestation.It is a process of vision, activity and precipitation.It is in connection with vision that much of the group difficulty lies. Let mebe specific and illustrate. I, your Tibetan brother, friend and teacher, have avision of the Plan; I am aware (because of my status as an initiate of a certaindegree) of the nature of the purpose for this particular cycle and what itsconditioning activities should be and to what end they are directed, for thereis an esoteric distinction between the Plan as it exists for humanity and forthe planet, and the purpose of the present world situation. Upon this,reflection would be profitable. Through the cooperation of A.A.B. I put thisplan—as far as was possible—before you, calling your attention to the New Groupof World Servers. As far as I could and dared I put it before the worldaspirants and called attention to the general trend of world events from thespiritual and subjective angles. This evoked from all of you an immediate andgratifying response; but it is possible, is it not, that this response hasremained subjective, intellectually perceived and aspirationally desired, butthat the Plan and the purposes of the kingdom of God are not yet truly a part ofyour life pattern and do not yet thoroughly condition your brain and your lifeactivity.Perhaps, therefore, the vision is not a part of your life and so integrated intoyour consciousness that you attach yourself to it as you have, in the past,attached yourself to individuals; the vision is a vision of group work, of grouprelationships, of group objectives, and of the group fusion to the larger Whole.When this is realised, then the vision determines your life incentives,tendencies and work, and when it is thus truly a part of your mental equipment,your emotional aspiration and your activities, and when there are sufficientgroups thus actuated, then the Kingdom of God will function objectively upon theearth. This is not yet the case, because the needed conditions are notfulfilled.The early seeds sown among animal-men were imbued with, or qualified by,separateness— a necessary quality for [102] the unfoldment ofself-consciousness, but one which must now be superseded.The seed groups now in process of forming will be distinguished by the qualityof fusion , and this should be as inevitable a development as is the separativeand protective nature of the ordinary human consciousness. It is this sense ofunion and of at-one-ment which is the protective and essential characteristic ofthe fifth kingdom, and it is this latent, yet actively present, factor whichleads unerringly and inevitably to the organisation—interior and subjective—ofthe seed groups, to their radiatory activity, and to the magnetic pull theyevidence when duly organised. Thus they produce fusion and blending.I am here putting new ideals and possibilities into as simple language aspossible; I seek not to veil and obscure their simplicity and truth by manyexplanatory paragraphs. What I have here said must be read with the eye ofvision and the understanding of the heart. Disciples must have these twofaculties as part of their usable equipment. Have you got them, or are youtrying to cultivate and unfold them, my brothers?Another of the aspects of this group work is that its influence is pervasive,and not at the beginning dynamic. The force which it later exerts will be due toconstant pervasive pressures and the steady spreading of the group influence andideals. It is therefore ultimately very far-reaching in its effectiveness,providing the work is done as indicated. This will be due eventually to twofactors: one, the power of the groups upon the subtler planes of thought anddesire, and finally upon egoic levels; this will become steadily more potent;secondly, to the activity of those who form part of the key groups; they willthemselves form corresponding groups of nine, or seven or five, and thus therewill be a gradual spreading throughout the world of an esoteric network. Forthis the majority are not yet ready, but I would have you bear it in mind. Trueinterest and acceptance of that which is indicated as essential to the discipleand to the work must first of all be patiently evidenced.[103] I have used the word “subjective” a great deal in my writings; I have donethis in an effort to shift the focus of attention to that which lies below thesurface. This refers, in the case of aspirants, to the subjective synthesis inthe three worlds and not to the astral and mental planes per se, or specificallyto egoic levels. If the inner kingdom of divine realities is to demonstrate uponearth, it will come through the emergence of the inner synthesis on to thephysical plane, and this is brought about by vital recognition and an expressionof the realities and laws governing that kingdom. The organisation which followsthe Vision is entirely subjective in nature and pervasive in quality. It is aprocess of germination, but if that which germinates does not eventually appearin objective manifestation the activity is then abortive.The influence of these new groups is due to the close inner relationdemonstrated through uniform thinking and a recognised unity of purpose. It isfor this reason (a truly scientific one in its nature) that I have emphasised sostrongly the ordinary characteristics of the trained disciple, which arenon-criticism, sensitivity and love. Where these are lacking, this simultaneousoneness and directed thought and this “group aroma” (as it is esotericallycalled, though the word I am attempting to translate is more adequate than theabove) become impossible. I have not been interested in the elimination ofhindering faults for the individual’s sake, but for the carrying forward of thedesired group purposes. The need is for group thinking of a powerful naturealong the indicated lines; for visualisation of the Vision of such a clearnature that it becomes a fact for the individual; for the development andfunctioning of the imagination, applied to the lines of outcome and results, andfunctioning so creatively that the results are seen with clarity and mustinevitably materialise. It involves also the holding of the inner subjectivelink with each other with such firmness that potent centres of force and ofcreative energy—working under inspiration from the Hierarchy, via the focussedminds of group members who are definitely en rapport with their [104] souls andwith each other—may function so successfully that the new civilisation and thenew culture can be rapidly established. As this has to be founded on a basis ofloving goodwill and upon nondestruction, and as its methods lead to rightrelations between men and nations, it is essential that the establishing groupsshould themselves express the subtler aspects of these desired virtues.The emphasis upon the work which serving groups must seek to develop is that ofan organised, scientific activity. Esoterically, this involves an understandingof the basic science of occultism, which is that of energy. The qualities,characteristics and activity upon which you should be engaged are definitely theexpression and understanding of energy along some line; hitherto, for themajority, force has been used and its impact on other forces has been noted andrecorded as force impacting force, leading thus to forceful results. But I seekto have you, as esotericists, deal with energy and the result of its impact uponforces. This is the scientific aspect of the occult life.The world is today full of forces in conflict and in wrong relation with eachother, and this produces the present chaos. The new order will be brought intoexpression by the play of the spiritual energy upon the forces in the threeworlds, and this will be the task of the New Groups when organised andfunctioning correctly. In these words, I have summed up one of the first andmost important objectives of the group work with which I and others of theworkers upon the spiritual side of life are at this time occupied. Some smallunderstanding of the significance of these words can be gained if you will watchthe effect that you produce in your environment during those times when you dosucceed in living as souls, and are therefore expressing soul energy, and arethus counteracting the personality forces in yourselves and in those around you.The desire of the Hierarchy at this time is to fill the world of striving forceswith points of spiritual energy, and to distribute everywhere those who areaffiliated with spiritual groups and are therefore linked subjectively to [105]their group brothers in all lands, so that a pervasive, intelligent influencecan ceaselessly make its impact felt upon the minds of men and produce finallythe needed good feeling, good will and good lives.~THE WORLD CRISISSeptember 1939Humanity is passing through an acute crisis and its karma or fate is heavy uponit. Being so close to events, it is not easy for humanity to see them in theirtrue perspective and it is in order that you may see more clearly that I writetoday. A broader vision and a wider horizon may help you to understand, and itmay be of profit to you if you can be helped to see the picture as it appears tous, the teachers on the inner side, and also in relation to its background.There are two outstanding and important points which are present in theconsciousness of the Hierarchy as it looks on at mankind going through thepresent stupendous struggle. The first is that humanity is today and on a largescale aware that what is happening is entirely its own doing and the result ofhumanity’s own mistakes. Men either feel responsible for what is occurring orthey are shifting the responsibility openly and deliberately on to shouldersother than their own. Of these endless and age-old mistakes, the VersaillesTreaty is only the symbol and the practical focal point.The second fact is that in spite of war and separation, of cruelty and ofpassions and selfishness running wild, there is nevertheless, today, more trueunderstanding, more goodwill and more outgoing love than at any previous time inthe history of the race. I say this with deliberation and because I have thehierarchical knowledge available to my hand. Be not deceived, therefore, by theouter clamour of war. I tell you that men’s hearts everywhere are full ofcompassion both for themselves and for all other men; the wide scope and thevast extent of the conflict is indicative of an [106] inner unity and asubjective interrelation of which all are somewhat conscious and which theconflict itself does not negate. Is this a hard saying? I seek to indicate toyou its basic truth if you will but ponder upon what I say with an open mind.The task of all aspirants and of all men of goodwill everywhere is to see thatprolonged suffering does not undermine the present right and essential attitudesand that the chaos and clamour does not shut out response to the voice of thesoul which has been speaking with increasing clarity for the past fourteenyears. The stimulation which was set up and the light which was permitted tocreep through after the last hierarchical conclave in 1925 has been real andeffective. That meeting of the Masters of the Wisdom upon spiritual levels ledto three results or happenings, and these we are today experiencing.The first was a fresh inflow of the Christ principle of spiritual or true lovewhich is ever free from emotionalism and selfish intent. This inflow resulted inthe immediate and rapid growth of all movements towards peace, worldunderstanding, goodwill, philanthropic effort and the awakening of the masses ofmen to the issues of brotherhood.The second was the stimulation of the principle of relationship and this led tothe growth and the perfecting of all sources of inter-communication such as thepress, the radio and travel. The inner objective of all this was to bring humanbeings closer together upon the outer plane of existence and thus parallelobjectively the developing inner, spiritual unity.The third was the inflow of the force of will or power from the Shamballacentre. This, as previously explained, is the most powerful force in the worldtoday, and only twice before in the history of mankind has this Shamballa energymade its appearance and caused its presence to be felt through the tremendouschanges which were brought about. Let us recapitulate briefly.The first time was during the great human crisis which occurred at the time ofthe individualisation of men in ancient Lemuria.[107] The second time was at the time of the struggle in Atlantean days betweenthe “Lords of Light and the Lords of Material Expression.”This little known divine energy now streams out from Shamballa. It embodies initself the energy which lies behind the world crisis of the moment. It is theWill of God to produce certain racial and momentous changes in the consciousnessof the race which will completely alter man’s attitude to life and his grasp ofthe spiritual, esoteric and subjective essentials of living. It is this forcewhich will bring about (in conjunction with the energy of love) that tremendouscrisis—imminent in the human consciousness—which we call the second crisis, theinitiation of the race into the Mystery of the Ages, into that which has beenhid from the beginning.It might be of value here if we considered the three great planetary centres andtheir relationships in tabular form and thus get the general idea more clearlyin mind.1. SHAMBALLA Will or Power Planetary Head Centre The Holy City Purpose . . Planspiritual pineal gland Life Aspect Ruler: Sanat Kumara, the Lord of the WorldThe Ancient of Days Melchizedek 2. THE HIERARCHY Love-Wisdom Planetary HeartCentre The New Jerusalem Unity At-one-ment Group Consciousness Ruler: The ChristThe World Saviour 3. HUMANITY Active Intelligence Planetary Throat Centre TheCity, standing foursquare Creativity Self-consciousness Ruler: Lucifer Son ofthe Morning The Prodigal SonThis Shamballa energy now for the first time is making its impact upon humanitydirectly and is not stepped down, as [108] has hitherto been the case, throughtransmission via the Hierarchy of Masters. This change of direction constituteda somewhat dangerous experiment as it necessarily stimulated the personalitiesof men, particularly those whose personalities were along the line of will orpower and in whom the love aspect of divinity was not sufficiently expressingitself; it was, however, permitted because it was realised that it would notaffect the man in the street or the masses who would remain unresponsive to it,though it might greatly stimulate and intensify the mental and more potent typeof man.The effects of this widespread stimulation have been all that was anticipatedand the so-called “evil results” of the Shamballa force upon ambitious andpowerful personalities in all countries and all schools of thought have,nevertheless, been offset to some extent by the growth of the sense ofrelationship everywhere and by the spread of the Christ energy which generatesat-one-ment, loving understanding and goodwill.You might here rightly enquire how this can be so when humanity is overwhelmedby a ghastly world war at this time. I would remind you that the Hierarchy isguided in its conclusions by the mass light and by the inner subjective oftunexpressed reactions of the multitude and never by the outer happenings uponthe physical plane. The fate of the form life and of outer organisations isdeemed of small importance compared with the sensed inner spiritual development.That development must necessarily outrun the outer manifestation. Humanity istoday further advanced spiritually and mentally than might appear from externalhappenings. The first result of such development is eventually the destructionof the outer form because it is proving inadequate to the pulsing, inner,spiritual life; then, secondly, comes the building of the new and more adequateouter expression. This accounts for the world crisis at this time. The cause isbased upon four major factors upon which I would like somewhat to enlarge: [109]1. Upon the point achieved in racial evolution. This today warrants the buildingof a better vehicle for human and racial expression.2. Upon the karmic causes which—as far as present humanity is concerned—can betraced back to an ancient conflict upon old Atlantis.3. Upon the coming into incarnation of certain potent personalities whose dharmaor destiny it is to bring about great evolutionary changes.4. Upon certain planetary happenings, connected with the life of the One “inWhom we live and move and have our being.” These involve the impact upon ourplanet of Forces and Energies which will be instrumental in altering theexisting civilisation and culture, in climaxing karmic necessity and in thusengineering release, presenting humanity with that stage in the experience ofthe disciple which we call “the meeting of the Dweller on the Threshold with theAngel of the Presence,” and inducing as a consequence a certain planetaryinitiation.These four stages of the Law of Cause and Effect (as it affects humanity at thistime) might be called:1. The perfecting of form expression . . .Law of Evolution2. The precipitation of karma . . . . . . . . .Law of Cause and Effect3. The achievement of personality . . . . . Law of Polar Opposites(The Dweller on the Threshold)4. The attainment of planetary initiation .Law of InitiationYou may perhaps think at this point that I am being academic and that the worldstress at this time is such that love, sympathy and kind words are needed farmore than [110] learned, historical retrospection and suggested hypotheses. Iseek, however, to foster in you the spirit of understanding. Such truecomprehension necessitates head knowledge as well as heart reaction. Thedisciples of the world today must endeavour to see why and to what end thepresent terrible happenings have occurred. A clear expression and statement ofcauses is needed—free from emotional bias and partisan emphasis. What ishappening today is not the result of immediate occurrences. When I say“immediate,” I refer to all happenings which have occurred within the Christianera. I want you to attempt to regard the present crisis as being caused orinitiated by events which are of so ancient an origin that modern, orthodoxhistorians have no record of them.Only two points of view will serve truly to clarify what is happening at thistime.First of all, a recognition that modern academic history constitutes only onepage in a vast historical record and that the initiating events of which we arein search and which are working out as effects in the planetary life at thistime belong to an age so distant that no modern historian recognises itsepisodes. Information anent this ancient period must be sought in the many worldScriptures, in ancient monuments, in the science of symbols, in the racialmyths, and in inherited and transmitted legends.Secondly, that a study of the microcosm, man, will be found to hold, as always,the key to the study of human affairs as a whole. Just as the aspirants anddisciples are at this time being tested and tried and subjected to the workingout of inexplicable conflicts and drastic changes in their lives, so the same istrue of the world aspirant, Humanity.To the above two reasons another might perhaps be added which will havesignificance and meaning to esotericists and to all who have in any way graspedthe teaching I have attempted to give you in my books anent the three worldcentres—Humanity, the Hierarchy and Shamballa. This world crisis is related tothe approach or the relation [111] of the Hierarchy to Humanity. That greatspiritual centre of force, the Human Kingdom, has now reached a point of suchpotency and of such a high vibratory activity that it is shaken to its verydepths; all its evolutionary grades and groups are responding to thestimulation, generated within the centre itself and also stimulated by Forcesemanating from the hierarchical centre and from Shamballa.This precipitates a crisis which has had no parallel in human history but whichfinds a faint reflection in the crisis which overtook the animal kingdom andwhich resulted in the formation of a new kingdom in nature—the human. As I haveearlier told you, this present world crisis, if met correctly and rightlycontrolled, will result in the manifestation of the fifth or spiritual kingdomupon earth. This (as you know) will be brought about by the at-one-ing of thetwo centres—the human centre and the Hierarchy. One of the major planetarysyntheses is taking place or, perhaps I should say, can take place. (I amwording this with care and would call your attention to my wording.)It might serve a useful purpose if I enlarged somewhat upon the four stages ofthe early causes, mentioned above. In so doing, I can give you some idea of theunderlying purpose of all the present happenings and some understanding of thepredisposing conditions which are to be found, lying far back in the night oftime. If I can do this adequately and if you can read and study withunderstanding and an open mind, some of your natural bewilderment may disappearand you may then be able to help others to live calmly through this crisis andto preserve an attitude of patience, goodwill, balance and compassion. Let us,therefore, consider these four points because, in so doing, we shall cover thefield sufficiently—I believe—to bring at least some measure of light to you.Later I will try to explain the significance of the Great Invocation and to giveyou some idea of the nature of the Forces invoked and of the esoteric meaningwhich these words (used so frequently by you) are intended to convey. [112]The Cause of the Present CrisisIt is well known to you that the great Law of Rebirth is the controlling andmajor law in all the processes of manifestation. It governs the exotericexpression of a solar Logos or of a human being, and the object of thisconstantly recurring process is to bring an increasingly perfect form to theexpanding service of the soul. For the first time since its inception, the humanfamily is in a position to note for itself the processes of the rebirth of acivilisation as an expression of spiritual culture at a particular point inevolution. Hence the magnitude of this crisis as it assumes its place in thehuman consciousness. Many lesser crises, initiating specific tribal, nationaland racial experiments in the renewal of form have gone on and have beenregistered by some group within a nation or by a nation itself (if advancedenough). Such a national registration took place for the first time inconnection with the French Revolution. Such registrations of evolutionary intenthave taken place with increasing clarity and understanding during the past twohundred years. Such crises have taken place in practically every nation inmodern times and have been recognised to some degree, and upon them historianshave enlarged and philosophers speculated. But the crisis today is far vaster,embracing as it does the majority of nations in both hemispheres. No nationremains at this time unaffected and the results are and must be registered insome aspect of the national life.Owing to the factual interrelation between nations everywhere and to therapidity of intercommunication, the present crisis is the first majorinternational crisis in human affairs and covers a period of twenty-eight years(from 1914 till 1942). These are interesting numbers, for 28 is 4 x 7, which arethe years of a complete personality cycle. I do not wish you to infer from theabove that the period of active combat and conflict must necessarily beprolonged until 1942. Such is not the case. The early termination of theconflict or its indefinite extension lies in the keeping of [113] humanityitself; men must increasingly determine their own fate as they emerge from thestage of adolescence into that of maturity, responsibility and achievement. Thisperiod of twenty-eight years is, however, of paramount importance and upon thenext three years much depends.Again I tell you that even the Hierarchy itself, with all its knowledge, visionand understanding and with all its resources, cannot coerce and cannot forecastwhat mankind will do. It can and does stimulate to right action; it can and doesindicate possibility and responsibility; it can and does send out its teachersand disciples to educate and lead the race; but at no point and in no situationdoes it command or assume control. It can and does bring good out of evil,illuminating situations and indicating the solution of a problem, but furtherthan this the Hierarchy cannot go. If it assumed authoritative control, a raceof automatons would be developed and not a race of responsible, self-directed,aspiring men. This must surely be apparent to you and may serve to answer thequestion which is uppermost in the minds of the unthinking, occult studentstoday: Why could not the Hierarchy have prevented this catastrophe?Unquestionably the Masters of the Wisdom with Their knowledge and Their commandof forces could have interfered, but in so doing They would have broken anoccult law and hindered the true development of mankind. This They will neverdo. At all costs, man must learn to stand and act alone. Instead, having doneall that was permissible, They now stand beside suffering and bewilderedhumanity and—with the deepest compassion and love—will help men to right thewrongs they have initiated, to learn the needed lessons and to come through thiscrisis (which they have themselves precipitated) enriched thereby, and purifiedin the fires of adversity. These are not platitudes but eternal truths.This world crisis, with all its horror and suffering, is—in the lastanalysis—the result of successful evolutionary processes. We are ready torecognise that when a man’s life cycle has been run and he has learnt thelessons which the [114] experience of any particular life has been intended toteach, his physical body and the inner form aspects (making the sum total of hispersonality expression) will begin to deteriorate; destructive agencies withinthe form itself will become active and eventually death will take place,resulting in the liberation of the indwelling life in order that a new andbetter form may be built. This, we perforce accept either blindly orintelligently, regarding it as a natural and unavoidable process, but normal andinevitable. We are apt, however, to forget that what is true of the individualis true of humanity. Cycles of civilisation such as that we call our moderncivilisation are analogous to a particular, individual, human incarnation withits inception, its progress and growth, its useful maturity and its ensuingdeterioration and subsequent death or the passing away of the form.Forms are ever open to attack. A strong subjective life and spiritual detachmentare the two safeguards. Where the form is more potent than the life, danger isimminent; where attachment to the material aspect or organisation is present,spiritual values are lost.Today we are watching the death of a civilisation or cycle of incarnation ofhumanity. In all fields of human expression, crystallisation and deteriorationhad set in. Worn-out religious dogmas and the grip of theology and the orthodoxchurches have no longer sufficed to hold the allegiance of the potent, inner,spiritual life; humanity is deeply spiritual and innately religious but needstoday a new form with which to clothe the ancient verities. Old politicalschools have been deemed inadequate and new ideologies bear witness to thestrength of the life which is seeking more adequate expression; the educationalsystems, having served their purpose, are fast being recognised as inadequate tomeet the need of the demanding life of the race; there is everywhere a cry forchange and for those new forms in the religious, political, educational andeconomic life of the race which will allow of freer and better spiritualexpression. Such a change is rapidly coming and is regarded by some asdeath—terrible and to be avoided if possible. It is [115] indeed death but it isbeneficent and needed. It is this realisation of the passing of a civilisationwhich gives rise to the recurrent and foreboding cry, “This is the death ofcivilisation; it must not be”; “This is the end of the order, and the old ordermust be saved”; “This is the destruction of the old and loved values, and itmust not be permitted.”That humanity is bringing about this needed change in unnecessary, cruel andpainful ways is indeed true, just as it is true today that human beings by theirwrong thinking, foolish habits of physical living and undesirable emotionalattitudes do precipitate a final, physical breakdown and eventually death.Nevertheless, for the progress of the soul of the individual and the soul ofhumanity, death is inevitable, good and necessary; it is also a practice withwhich we are all most familiar in our own experience and in watching it inothers. But we need to remember that the worst death of all (as far as humanityis concerned) would be if a form of civilisation or a body form became staticand eternal; if the old order never altered and the old values were nevertransmuted into higher and better ones, that would indeed be a disaster.We need to bear in mind also that the forces of destruction or death aretwo-fold: first, the rapidly emerging and developing life with its demand formore room for expression and fuller experience, and its spiritual aspiration forchange and progress; and secondly, the reactionary forces and the conservativeattitudes which adhere to the well-known and the familiar, and which hate thenew, the untried and the unknown. Both of these produce the great and divinetransition from the past into the future, and from the old into the new, fromexperience into fruition and then into experience again. The realities areeternal and undying; the forms are ephemeral and temporary; the soul ispersistent and deathless; the form is changing and doomed to die. The processesof evolution have in the past and will in the future prove successful inbringing forms to birth, to maturity and to death.But (and this is the interesting and significant point) [116] humanity is forthe first time aware of process. It has for the first time chosen intelligentlyto observe what is going on and to relate it to experience and to environment.This in itself indicates a stage of true and much to be desired development.Reasoning, analysis and the presentation of differing viewpoints are going on inevery country on a large scale with varying results, based on differences oftemperament, of tradition, of development and of training.This stage of death and of birth (for the two are proceeding simultaneously) canbe easily grasped by the esotericist as he studies the world war in its twodistinctive periods: 1914 to 1918, and 1939 until 1942. The first stage (if youcould see the situation as it truly is) was most definitely the death stage; thesecond stage, in which we now find ourselves, is literally the stage ofbirth—the birth pangs of the new order and of the new civilisation through whichhumanity’s sense of life can express itself. The mother dies in order that thechild may live; the form is sacrificed to the life. But today, the form aspect,the Mother or matter aspect, is dying consciously, and just as consciously thechild, the infant civilisation, is coming into being. This is the new thing andit is in this that we are all participating. It is the death of the personalityof humanity and the coming in of the soul .Such a dying is ever a painful process. Pain has always been the purifyingagent, employed by the Lords of Destiny, to bring about liberation. Theaccumulated pain of the present war and the inherited pain of the earlier stage(begun in 1914) is bringing about a salutary and changing world consciousness.The Lord of Pain has descended from His throne and is treading the ways of earthtoday, bringing distress, agony and terror to those who cannot interpret Hisends, but bringing also a re-stimulation of the instinct to self-preservationwhich—in its higher aspect—is the instinct to immortality; it tends to focushumanity’s attention upon the life aspect and not upon the form. The names ofthe Lords of Karma signify, symbolically and from the angle of their innermeaning, Relationship, Enlightenment, Pain [117] and Return. Ponder on this.They are all peculiarly active at this time, and in their activity lies the hopeof humanity.Ancient Karmic EventsIt is not my intention to explain or elaborate the subject of Karma. This occultyet fundamentally exoteric theme, the Law of Cause and Effect, evokes a generalrecognition when called by this name. When called the Law of Karma, it isimmediately regarded as mysterious, Oriental and new. Called (as it sometimesis) the Law of Retribution, an entirely erroneous connotation has becomeattached to it. Today, the karma of humanity is descending upon it. I wouldremind you, however, that the continuous emphasis laid upon the malevolentaspects of karma conveys a wrong impression and negates the full grasp of thetruth. There is as much good karma as there is bad; even in the present worldsituation, the good karma emanating from the soul of humanity balances the evilwhich comes from the material aspect and is continuously over-emphasised. It isthe rhythm of matter in contradistinction to the rhythm of the soul, and theseconstitute the initiating causes of the present conflict, both in individuallives and in the general world situation. When this is properly grasped, thetrue picture may emerge in your hearts and minds with greater clarity.In my effort to make clear the picture, I shall have to overlook many essentialdetails; I shall also be forced to take the always debatable position of makingstatements which cannot be checked and which find their sole arguments (as faras the average thinker is concerned) in deduction from the effects produced bycauses that do not appear to the occultly unenlightened. In time to come, manwill develop that mental attitude which will consider causes of greaterimportance than effects; he will then learn to consider with care the firststeps taken in initiating any line of action, pondering upon and deducing theprobable effects before committing himself to any specific deed. Only throughpain, [118] error and consequent price-paying will this salutary stage bereached.Today, all that is taking place is due, first of all, to the essential dualityof man; in the second place, it is due to certain major lines of cleavage whichwere brought about by this essential dualism in an early stage of human history,and thirdly, to the growing tendency towards synthesis which the inflow of theShamballa force is producing at this time. This is the simplest statement I findit possible to make anent this complex problem. With broad generalities I coverthe past, indicate the effects which are now being experienced in the present,and forecast the future.It was the coming into incarnation of the spiritually self-conscious human beingwhich is the inciting cause of the present conflict. Had the sons of God not“come in unto the daughters of men” (which is the Biblical and symbolic way ofexpressing the great relationship between spirit and matter which wasestablished in the human kingdom), had the spiritual entities which are humanityitself not taken unto themselves material forms, and had the positive spiritualelement not attached itself to the negative material aspect, the present worldconflict would not be taking place. But the divine plan of evolution was basedupon the production of this relationship between spiritually conscious man andthe form aspect, and thus the great Law of Duality came into action, bringingabout the “fall of the angels,” as they descended from their sinless and freestate of existence in order to develop full divine awareness upon earth, throughthe medium of material incarnation and the use of the principle of mind. Thiswas the divine plan, emanating from the Mind of God and swept into activity andprogressive unfoldment by an act of His Will. At its inception, there took placethe original “war in the heavens,” when the sons of God who responded to thedivine urge to experience, to serve and to sacrifice, separated themselves fromthe sons of God who responded to no such inspiration but who chose to stay intheir original and high state of being. To this truth, Christ Himself borewitness in the story of [119] the Prodigal Son and his relationship to his elderbrother, who had not left the Father’s home. It is obvious, is it not, from thisparable, where the approbation of the Father lay; a careful study of this storyand an intuitive understanding of its implications may evoke some day a responseto the “sin of experience,” as it has been called, and a comprehension of thetwo major laws governing the process: the Law of Evolution and the Law ofRebirth. Here lies the prime initiating cause of what is taking place today.The second cause arose slowly out of the first. Matter and spirit, focussed inthe human family and expressing their basic qualities and essential nature, wereeternally in conflict. In the early stages and during the long Lemurian cycle,infant humanity steadily evolved and yet in spite of this the lines of cleavage,though present, were not recognised. The latent spark of mind served only tobring a relative enlightenment to the five senses and their purely physicalapplication. The physical life was strong; the deductive or self-registeringlife was practically nil. The life of humanity was then focussed within thephysical body, thus fortifying and stimulating the animal nature and developingthe physical organism and the various internal organs through the unfoldment ofthe five senses; man became primarily a selfish and a fighting animal with,however, at times, vague tendencies towards something dimly sensed as better andwith moments of high grade desire which was not aspiration and the urge toprogress, as we know it, but their embryonic forms.It is not possible for modern man to vision or understand such a state ofconsciousness, for he has left it too far behind. The focus of the life forcewas also in the region of the adrenal glands, producing animal courage andresistance to shock. But the dualism of man’s essential nature was, as always,present and the lines of cleavage gradually appeared; slowly yet steadily, thepioneering souls (a very small minority) shifted their consciousness graduallyhigher into the solar plexus and a recognition of the factor of desire for thatwhich was material and a capacity for emotional reaction [120] began to develop.Hitherto, in Lemurian times, desire and instinct were identical. Ponder on this,for it is interesting because it concerns a state of consciousness of whichmodern man knows practically nothing. But, in Atlantean times, the lines ofdemarcation between what constituted purely physical life and that which—thoughstill material—could be the goal of effort and thus acquired, began to controlthe purely animal nature; man began to be acquisitive and to surround himselfwith that which he wanted. The lines of cleavage between the instinctual animaland acquisitive man began to be more clearly defined.Gradually the mental element unfolded among these pioneers just as the intuitiveelement is today unfolding among the mental types; men began to acquire someform of mental perception and to bring what little mind they had to theprocesses of increasing their material possessions. The stage of civilisation(which is basically a recognition of group relation) began. A period of urbanexistence superseded that of a pure nomadic and agricultural existence. Menbegan to congregate together for their greater material comfort and protection,and the rhythmic processes of concentration and their world-wide extensionbegan. These cycles are similar to the inbreathing and the outbreathing of thephysical organism of man. Some day a study will be made of these basic andcontrolling factors of human existence, dispersion or decentralisation, andcommunity life or the expression of the herd instinct on a higher or lower turnof the spiral of existence. The past few hundred years have seen a major problemarise in the present tendency of humanity to collect together in great citiesand to congregate in vast herds, leaving the countryside denuded of itspopulation and creating serious problems of sustenance, of health and also ofcrime. Right before our eyes this rhythm is today changing and a serious problemis being solved; cities are being evacuated and—as men and women are drivenforth for one reason or another into the country—the lords of evolution areforcing the breaking up of the rhythm of concentration and substituting for itthe rhythm [121] of dispersion. This will do much for the race and willfacilitate the unfoldment of a subjective synthesis which will greatly enrichhumanity and give new values to living.The lines of cleavage between the animal, instinctual nature and some form ofdesire (embryonic aspiration) steadily grew during Atlantean times and thisearly civilisation began to demonstrate its own note and to set new standards ofmaterial comfort and of selfish control on an increasingly large scale as theurban existence developed. It is perhaps difficult for us to visualise a worldas densely populated then as is the modern world but so it was. The animalnature, being dominant, the tendency was towards sexual relationship and theproduction of large families, just as it is among the lower orders in ourcivilised areas today, for the peasantry and the slum dwellers produce morechildren than do the intelligentsia. In those far-off times, the only people whohad any true measure of intelligence were the disciples and initiates; theyguided and guarded infant humanity, much as modern parents guide and guard theirchildren, and as the state assumes responsibility for the welfare of the nation.The Hierarchy was, in those days, present upon the earth as the priest-kings andthey acted as focal points of attractive energy, drawing to themselves those inwhom the more intangible values were slowly assuming a vague control, thusmaking the lines of cleavage between materialism and spirituality still moreclear and definite.We must remember that the spirituality of that time was of a very differentquality from that which now goes under that name. It was in the nature of anaspiration towards a sensed hereafter, for a satisfying beauty and for emotionalcompletion. There was no thought—as we know thought—in this attitude but only areaching out after a sensed unattainable and for that which was desirable. Thiswas fostered in the people by the Hierarchy through the gift of variousinventions and by the use of the instinctual masses of men in building great andbeautiful cities and stupendous structures, the remnants of which persist until[122] today. This was done under the expert guidance of the initiates and adeptswho employed their knowledge of the nature of matter and energy to produce muchthat today man is gropingly endeavouring to discover and make possible. All thatthe modern processes of civilisation have made possible, and much more than thatwhich today comes under the name of scientific discovery were known in oldAtlantis, but they were not developed by men themselves but given to them as afree gift, much as people today give to a child beautiful and wonderful thingswhich the child uses and enjoys but which he does not understand in any way.Great and beautiful cities, full of temples and great buildings (of which theChaldean and Babylonian remains are the degenerate remnants, and the modernskyscraper the child) were everywhere to be found. Most of our modern scientificknowledge was possessed by these priest-kings and constituted in the eyes of themasses a form of wonderful magic. Sanitation, hygiene, means of transportationand air machines were developed and of a very high order; these were not theresult however of man’s achievement but gifts from the Hierarchy, developed orconstructed under a wise guidance. There was command of air and water becausethe guides of the race knew how to control and master the forces of nature andof the elements, but none of it was the result of human understanding, knowledgeor effort. The minds of men were undeveloped and not adequate to such a task,any more than is the mind of a little child.The cleavage between the two groups (the one expressing the forces ofmaterialism and the other the energy of light) grew gradually wider untiltowards the close of the Atlantean Age it was so wide, and the lines ofdemarcation between the two schools of life and thought were so clear, that acrisis was precipitated in the then civilised world of which the presentconflict is a definite effect. Let us also hope that it constitutes a climaxwhich will never again occur. Then took place the great war between the Lords ofForm and the Lords of Being, or between the Forces of Matter and the Great WhiteLodge. A careful study of [123] volume two of The Secret Doctrine will proveenlightening to students, if they will study with particular care pages 275-466.To our understanding, this account may seem vague and obscure, but the issues atthe time were clear. The Forces of Light triumphed because the Hierarchy wasforced to intervene potently, and, with the aid of certain great Livesextraneous to our planetary life, They brought the Atlantean civilisation to anabrupt end after a long period of chaos and disaster. This took place throughthe medium of a culminating catastrophe which wiped hundreds of thousands ofhuman beings off the face of the earth. This historical event has been preservedfor us in the universal legend of the great flood.Those who survived are symbolically spoken of in the Bible as those who weresaved in Noah’s ark, and in the ancient writings it is expressed in thefollowing terms:“Like as a dragon snake uncoils slowly its body, so the sons of men, led on bythe Sons of Wisdom, opened their folds and spreading out like a running streamof sweet waters.... Many of the faint-hearted among them perished on their way.But most were saved.”A close study of the tale as given in The Secret Doctrine will reveal the stateof immature development (from the angle of our modern standards) and of thebasically emotional and physical focus of the humanity of the period; it willshow also man’s magical ability to subdue and control the subhuman kingdoms andthe elemental forces of the planet. These are two angles which have been butlittle studied.Emphasis has, however, been rightly placed upon divine interference andintervention; this succeeded in salvaging an ethically sound minority (the word“spiritual” would not yet apply, except relatively) and in destroying those whowere wrongly focussed or oriented and, therefore, dedicated to the life ofmaterial aspiration and perception.[124] This nucleus which was saved, formed the basis of our present root race,the Aryan. The whole theme of the Old Testament is built around the developmentand growth of this nucleus. Symbolically speaking, the inhabitants of the arkand their descendants and the Jewish race stand for the salvaged remnant ofhumanity—salvaged in spite of themselves and in face of stupendous difficultiesby the Great White Lodge.Two points warrant attention here. The first and least important from thestandpoint of the soul is the disappearance off the earth of practically allsigns of the wonderful Atlantean civilisation except for those fewarchaeological treasures which intrigue and interest modern research workers,plus those dim memories of ancient scientific achievement which lead the modernstudent to investigation and invention, and which incite him to discovery andthe production of what we call the triumphs of modern science.The second point is that for the good of humanity, the Hierarchy withdrew intothe background, leaving man to find his own way out of the mirage and illusionof materialism in right ways and eventually to bring to an end the ancientcleavages. War must be brought to its final consummation and expression with aview to its final discarding as a means of arriving at desired ends.The Modern EraI would like to pause here and remind you of one or two points which should berecognised as we approach this modern era in which all these culminating effectsare taking place. Let me state them concisely and clearly.The lines of cleavage between materialism and spirituality (as we now understandthe terms) have become increasingly clear. Two things have tended to bring thisabout. First, the pronouncement of the Ten Commandments. These, though negativein their form and dogmatic in their attitude, have made the issues and therequired attitudes adequately clear. Owing to the relatively low stage of the[125] universal human intelligence at the time that they were given (for theBiblical dates are not correct and the date of their pronouncement is far olderthan is thought) they were expressed by the formula, “Thou shalt not,” thusturning human attention to the material expression of material tendencies. Indays to come, the Ten Commandments will be expressed in a reversed form of whichthe Sermon on the Mount and the Beatitudes are the embryonic form.Second, the Hierarchy withdrew in order that humanity, on reaching maturity andyears of discretion, should not be handicapped and hindered by coercion andundue safeguarding but should express its major divine characteristics. Ofthese, free will and the discriminating use of the mind are the outstandingqualities. There was no free will in Atlantean days. There is a tendency to freewill (note that term) today and we call it liberty and independence, freedom ofthought and the right of the individual to determine the issues which control orshould control the group of which he is a part. These are all attributes andqualities of free will but not the divine principle of free will per se. Of thatwe know as yet but little. Only the disciples of the world and the initiatesknow the true significance and implications of freedom of choice, and the rightuse of the will, and this because they are motivated by group good and the needof the majority.The test to which humanity was to be subjected and which is today thecontrolling factor was whether—given mental development and knowledge—it wouldconsecrate that knowledge and its scientific and mental attainment to group goodor to selfish ends, to material issues or to spiritual incentives and impulses.This ancient conflict has now been carried through into another field of humanexpression, that of the mind and—as the race has progressed and thepersonalities of human beings have reached a high stage of integration andachievement—the conflict has become acute, the issues clearer and the ranging ofthe opponents into two clearly defined groups is now so complete that the finalstruggle has become possible.[126] Intelligent appreciation of the situation and a general capacity topresent to the mind the underlying conditions has now been achieved by the bulkof the intelligent people upon the planet and, though the point of view isnecessarily coloured by national traditions, inherited ideas and policies aswell as by environmental control and bias, the race has gone a long way towardsits final emancipation. There is, therefore, a certain measure of free willdisplayed, and this constitutes an entirely new factor and a most satisfactorydevelopment. But I would remind you of a most important point and that is thatthe masses of the people—the middle classes, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat(I use these words in their general sense and simply because of theirsignificance and meaning)—are still victims of authority, of control, and remainrelatively unthinking and childlike. This means that the true conflict isbetween a small minority to whom the issues are illuminatingly clear and whohave definitely ranged themselves on one side or other of the embattled forces.A mere handful of men, the direct descendants or rather the reincarnations ofthe leaders in the ancient Atlantean conflict, are now on earth, directing theforces of light or of darkness and bringing into being a direct line-up ofmillions of men whose will is that of their leaders.The lines of cleavage have grown steadily until now they can be expressed interms of a humanity which is oriented towards the higher spiritual andaltruistic values and whose keynotes are sacrifice, group good and worldunderstanding, and those whose focus is predominantly material and whose aimsare selfish, animated by ambition and the spirit of acquisition.It was the acuteness of this situation, and the wide extent of the cleavage,which induced the watching Hierarchy to permit a direct inflow of the Shamballaforce (in spite of its attendant risks) to pour into the world. The objectivewas to stimulate the free will of the masses; the result upon them has beenrelatively good as it has led to the formulation and expression of the greatworld ideologies—Fascism, [127] Democracy and Communism as well as thatpeculiarly distorted blend of Fascism and Communism which goes by the name ofHitlerism or Nazism. All these ideologies are fostered by the desire of themasses for the betterment of the condition in which the populace in any countrylives and it has become focussed, expressive and creative by the force of theShamballa influence. But another result of this inflow of the will-to-power hasbeen to stimulate a certain group of outstanding personalities in many lands sothat they have assumed control of the masses and can thus determine the policiesand methods—religious, political and social—of the different nations. In everynation a relatively small group of people decide all important issues anddetermine all major national activities. This they do either by force, terrorand deception or by persuasion, fair words and the application of ideologicalmotives. Of this situation in the world the Lords of Destiny are availingthemselves in order to bring the ancient conflict to an end and so enablehumanity to pass into the new Aquarian Age relatively free and with a clearerunderstanding of right human aims, right relationships and man’s predestinedfuture.It will serve no purpose for me to trace the relation of the present worldconflict and the present world leaders to the conflict and the leaders inAtlantean times. Suffice it to say that many of the same personalities (on ahigher turn of the spiral) are again playing their various parts in the greatdrama. It is no service to you and to your mental grip upon the situation for meto emphasise the details of that great war and its modern correspondences; it isof no value for me to compare the old methods and the modern usages whereby oneside or the other carries forward the struggle for supremacy. You are in noposition to verify what I say or to check the accuracy of my statements. Thepoint which is, however, of major importance is for you to arrive at a clearunderstanding of what is at stake and a just appreciation of the values involvedand also a correct grasp of the ideals animating the two groups of opponents.In Atlantean days, it was stated that the battle was between [128] the Forces ofDarkness (the so-called “Black Lodge of Adepts”) and the Forces of Light (theso-called Great White Lodge, the Hierarchy of Masters). That was thenapproximately true, for the conflict was between two small groups and the massesof the people were simply the blind and miserable victims of the fight and ofthe situation.Today, it is not possible to make such a clear distinction between the forcesengaged, nor is it properly admissible. No nation or group of nations can beclassed in a broad generalisation as either black or white. Bear this in mind.Only those with no vision and an intolerant and prejudiced spirit will speakthus. All nations have within them those who belong in their thousands to thecategory of those who are swayed by the Forces of Light and who, therefore,respond normally and easily to the concept of goodwill, to the desire for rightrelationship between all men and to the ideal of true international and worldunderstanding. In all nations there are those to whom this position makes noappeal at all and they are still in darkness and blinded to the true issues.This is a statement of fact. Those who seek to see the establishment of goodwilland understanding are in the majority but are—as I pointed out in earlierwritings—relatively futile to control the situation as yet or to force theirleaders to follow the mass will-to-good. They are either inspired or protectedby the Hierarchy of Light and it is with them that the task of stimulating thefree expression of this goodwill must be carried forward when the conflict ends.As for the other group, they are those who through inclination or ancient karmaare the descendants of the Lords of darkness; their actions and ideals makepossible the activity of the forces of materialism. I would have you note thatphrasing. Even the most dangerous of them are nevertheless conscious of someform or another of idealism, but they are misguided and full of response to thewill-to-power (power upon the physical plane and through the medium of formactivity). This is stimulated by the inflow of the Shamballa energy. Because ofthese reactions and tendencies, they constitute focal points for those Lives and[129] Energies which are inherent in matter itself and whose influence and workare dedicated to the preservation of form, and of that which is . They endeavourconstantly to negate the new and to hold back the evolution and development ofthe human consciousness. Forget not that the real issue is in the field ofconsciousness and that the struggle is between form and the life within theform, and between progress, leading to the liberation of the human spirit, andreactionary activity, leading to the imprisonment of the human consciousness andthe restriction of its free expression.I would pause here and solemnly beg you not to make the lines of cleavage widerby placing yourself, and all who follow your form of ideology, upon the side ofthe Forces of Light and all other people and their ideologies, with which youmay not agree, upon the side of the Forces of Darkness. The issue is, in thelast analysis, the right to express the will-to-good, the right to express humanrelationships, untrammelled by territorial barriers and national habits ofthought; it involves the right and the felt necessity to shew love to all beingsand thus stamp out all hate and separateness. It concerns the right of allnations to live at peace with their neighbours and harmoniously with each otherand to express the true and subjective synthesis of humanity, and not placenational possessions, frontiers, culture, power and ambition before the generalgood and the happiness of the world of men. This is the real and underlyingissue. All the national challenges and patriotic calls are simply the attemptsof the leaders everywhere to hold the people to a particular line of thought andof action. To make the world safe for democracy, to gain room to live, to defendthe rights of little nations, to preserve the balance of power, to meet forcewith force, to restore ancient and historical boundaries, to impose some culturedeemed desirable, to prevent economic destruction, to conserve national stakesand interests are all the talking points of the leaders today. But the realissue is the intangible one of Direction. Which way will humanity go? [130] Willit go the way of selflessness, expressed in a willingness to act always in theinterests of all, thus promoting world understanding and world unity, or the wayof selfishness and aggression, expressed in an intense nationalism, thussacrificing the true and larger values of liberty, independence and freedom tothink. This selfishness may show itself through active aggression or an activeneutrality. Those nations who participate in no way in this struggle will losemuch and—enhancing their own selfish struggle and clouding the real issue inbeautiful words—will help to prolong the struggle and hold back their own peoplefrom useful opportunity.I would point out here also that as in all families, business and organisationsthere are those who are the focal points of authority and the designers of theplanned activities, so within that group or organised body which goes by thename of humanity there are similar focal points or those who plan, direct andproduce the outer happenings and events. They are in the period of personalityachievement—that time in which human beings, having achieved integration and ablended expression of feeling and perception and mind, are actively andeffectively working upon the physical plane. These focal points are used tobring about two major changes in the world; the first is the fusion and blendingof peoples and minorities so that coordinated empires and cultural nations areappearing everywhere and, secondly, the changing of frontiers and the alteringof boundaries so that a complete re-adjustment of the map of the world in Asia,Europe and Africa can take place.It will be apparent to you that three major methods or modes of producing thesefusions can be noted. Great Britain, the United States of America and the Unionof Socialist Soviet Republics (the U.S.S.R.) are working out the principle offederation, of relation and of the fusion of bodies into concentrated wholes,responding to the same inspiration but employing their own specialised methodsto bring about the desired ends. Be not surprised by my [131] including Russiain this triplicity. Their ideology is fundamentally as sound as that in theother groups, but the difference lies in the factors of personality and the modeof applying the ideology. The control of powerful and dangerous personalities,and the use of the methods of force and cruelty have been avoided in the firsttwo groups of nations, and the reason is based upon the different source of theinspiration producing the effects. Another reason is to be found in the placingof power in the hands of those who are historically unprepared to rule and ofthose whose past unfoldment has as yet brought them only to the nursery stage ofevolution.Nevertheless in these three groups there is much of interest to be noted. One ofthem, Great Britain, represents a fusion, the foundations of which have beenlaid in a long historical past of preparation for government; another, that ofthe U.S.A. represents a fusion which is unfolding and developing in the presentwhich is new in its experiments, though employing factors from every nation inEurope; the U.S.S.R. in its turn represents a coming fusion or future synthesis.In these three, you have an interesting and immediate expression of the threedivine aspects, each of which inspires and colours the embryonic civilisation.Great Britain expresses the will-to-power but on account of age and experience,dearly bought, this is today mellowed by justice and a growing understanding ofhuman need. This, in its turn, is the result of the control for many centuriesin the past by the aristocracy, with its paternalism, conservatism and itsmethod of slow adjustment. The U.S.A. expresses the will-to-love, which showsitself in an ability to absorb vastly divergent elements and yet to presentequal opportunity to all. This is brought about very largely because the controlis, in this federation of states, in the hands of the bourgeoisie, with itsfinancial goals, its power to determine living conditions, and its quick andsympathetic touch upon life. Its method is not that of slow adjustment but ofquick assimilation. It is in that country also that people are most sensitive[132] to the influence of the Hierarchy. The U.S.S.R. expresses thewill-to-create and to produce new conditions and a new order—planned anddetermined and foreseen. This has been brought about through cruelty very often,by a willingness to compromise and to change or lower the original ideal. This,in its turn, is brought about by the activity of the proletariat with itsinability to govern, its desire to retaliate, and its ignorance of tradition andof inherited procedures.A most interesting experiment is, therefore, working out in these three groupsof interrelated elements and differing national ideals. The U.S.S.R. willeventually place its emphasis and direct its major interest upon Asia, bringingabout great changes on that continent, as far as the Pacific. The other, GreatBritain, through its successful demonstration of the principle of federation,can affect major changes in Europe if there is an awakened insight, a true andsympathetic justice and wise patience. The U.S.A. has a similar task to performfor the Americas, calling for statesmanship of a high order and a spirit ofunderstanding.It will also be apparent to you if you have rightly understood the abovesuggestions that the Shamballa force is working through that community offederated nations called the British Empire and is expressing thewill-towards-synthesis and the will to just and legal procedure. It is the forceof the Hierarchy which can express itself increasingly through the United Statesof America, for an intuitive recognition of subjective realities and a realsense of the higher values can and frequently do control the impulses governingthis group of federated states. The will-to-be of Humanity with its almostextravagant emphasis upon human values and the will-to-rule creatively is thecontribution of the U.S.S.R., that great federation of republics. Thus theinfluence of the three great world centres about which I have earlier writtencan be seen expressing itself through these three groups of nations. At the sametime, the Shamballa force is active in all of them, for it produces federationand synthesis. Its first great expression or demonstration [133] of the spiritof fusion took place in the 18th and 19th centuries, and led to the formation ofsuch countries as Italy and Germany which were created out of many smallerstates, duchies and kingdoms. A history of the trend towards fusion in themodern world would prove a most illuminating study. It would be found that thefirst faint indications were felt around 1575 A.D. This was due to the fact thatpermission for the inflow of this force was given when demanded at theCentennial Conference of the Hierarchy, held in 1425. I referred to thisconference in my earlier writings. (A Treatise on White Magic, pp. 401-433. ATreatise on the Seven Rays”, Vol.I (Esoteric Psychology), pp. 170-189.)In the second group of changing ideologies and of reaction to mass need, youwill find France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal, all of whom have alteredtheir ancient policies, changed their forms of government and reacted graduallyand slowly to the Shamballa force. They have, however, reacted to that forcethrough the medium of certain great and outstanding personalities who werepeculiarly sensitive to the will-to-power and the will-to-change and who (duringthe past 150 years) have altered the character of their national life, andemphasised increasingly the wider human values. The men who inspired theinitiating French revolution; the great conqueror, Napoleon; Bismarck, thecreator of a nation; Mussolini, the regenerator of his people; Hitler who lifteda distressed people upon his shoulders; Lenin, the idealist, Stalin and Francoare all expressions of the Shamballa force and of certain little understoodenergies. These have wrought significant changes in their day and generation andaltered the face of Europe, incidentally affecting Asia and conditioningattitudes and policies in America.The results even when dangerous and terrible, have developed two vitalcharacteristics in humanity. One has been the widespread development of thediscriminating faculty, and secondly, a tendency to dispersion with its [134]consequences of diffusing civilised and cultural values and the diverse gifts ofthe many people to the world soul. The drift of people to the colonies fromGreat Britain, the drift of the people from every nation in Europe to America,North and South, the dispersal of people within national boundaries as theresult of war and expediency such as the evacuation of cities has brought abouttoday, the removal of people out of Italy and of groups of people within Russia,and the constant moving onwards of the wandering Jews indicate a breaking down,upon a world-wide scale, of all outer boundaries and the institution of aprocess of blending and amalgamation such as the world has never seen before. Itconstitutes an educational system of untold value, leading as it does to theconstant necessity to readjust viewpoints, to change modes of living, tointermarriage and so-called illicit relations. The outer change is producing aninner synthesis and outer dispersion, and cleavages are working out interiorlyin closer relations and a more tolerant spirit of understanding. The power toconsider, to choose, to think and to discriminate is rapidly developing amongall classes everywhere as a result of the many cataclysmic happenings, thepresentation of many changing circumstances and the many points of view andtheories of government and of religion; these grow naturally out of new contactsand the rapid presentation of events through the medium of the press and theradio.It is this that is of importance from the standpoint of evolution and the growthof the world consciousness. The physical plane happenings are incidental and ofno permanent lasting power.The physical plane events and precipitations are carried forward and madepossible through focal points of energy who are the world dictators, the worldstatesmen, and the outstanding human beings in all lands as well as by groupswhich are actively working in every country for their own ends or—as is moreoften the case—under the influence of some group ideal or wisdom plus personalambition, personal will-to-power and personal aggrandisement. [135] We callthese people dictators, demagogues, inspired leaders, or just and wise men,according to our peculiar ideology, tradition, attitudes to our fellowmen andour particular political, economic and religious training. But all these leadersare simply human beings and like other men—idealistic, mistaken, lovers of theircountry, egoists, impressionable, foolish, cunning, powerful, focussed on somegoal or ambition, with clear vision and at the same time myopic reactions, cruelor wise as the case may be—but, in the last analysis, highly developedpersonalities. They are being used to engineer great and needed changes and toalter the face of civilisation. The wrong methods employed and the evil thingsdone are the fault of humanity as a whole, and of the habits of thought whichhave made mankind selfish and cruel and cause this great and universal spirit ofthe will-to-change to manifest so powerfully and cruelly.Blame not the personalities involved or the men who produce these events beforewhich we stand today bewildered and appalled. They are only the product of thepast and the victims of the present. At the same time, they are the agents ofdestiny, the creators of the new order and the initiators of the newcivilisation; they are the destroyers of what must be destroyed before humanitycan go forward along the Lighted Way. They are the embodiment of the personalityof humanity. Blame yourselves, therefore, for what is today transpiring and seeknot to evade responsibility by placing it upon the shoulders of spectacular menor any statesmen, dictator or upon any group. Look not to one person or to onegroup of persons and accuse them of causing the present world condition. Looknot also to any one person or group to bring liberation or to find a solution ofthe world problem. That is for humanity itself to do. Humanity must take actionand will do so, when the right time comes. To recognise joint responsibility,joint mistakes, ancient errors of judgment, wrong attitudes and habits ofthought, world-wide selfish purpose and intent, a universal spirit of aggressionwhich, down the ages, has [136] influenced first one nation and then another,the tendency last century to crystallise and become static, the reactionaryforces on every hand—these are universal qualities and no nation and no race isfree of guilt or has entirely clean hands. Also, no one national group is purelywrong and evil or purely good and unselfish. There are mixed motives everywhere.Nationalism, aggression, selfishness and cruelty in all countries face a desirefor world understanding, peaceful relations, and an unselfish and beneficentspirit also in all countries. The Forces of Light find their adherents and theirworkers in every country though some are subjected to greater handicaps inexpression than others. So also do the Forces of Materialism. And in betweenthese two great groups stand the masses—waiting for the emergence of freshopportunity and new revelations.It is the universality of these conditions and the clear-cut issues that havemade this period one of planetary opportunity and planetary initiation.Initiation is essentially a moving out from under ancient controls into thecontrol of more spiritual and increasingly higher values. Initiation is anexpansion of consciousness which leads to a growing recognition of the innerrealities. It is equally the recognition of a renewed sense of the need forchange and the wise engineering of these needed changes so that real progresscan be made; the consciousness is expanded and becomes more generously anddivinely inclusive and there is a fresh and more potent control by the soul asit assumes increasingly the direction of the life of the individual, of a nationand of the world.In the last analysis, and from the standpoint of the Hierarchy, the presentconflict between the personality of humanity (expressing the material values asthe dominating factor in life experience) and the soul of humanity (expressingthe spiritual values as the dominating factor in human affairs) is identicalwith the conflict which takes place within a human being’s consciousness when hehas reached the stage of discipleship and is faced with the problem of the pairsof opposites. This conflict is expressed in many [137] ways according to thepoint of view and the background of thought. It can be called the conflictbetween Christ and anti-Christ but not as those who usually employ those phrasesunderstand them. No one nation is expressive of the spirit of anti-Christ, justas no one nation expresses the spirit of Christ. Christ and anti-Christ are thedualities of spirituality and materialism, both in the individual and inhumanity as a whole. Or you can speak of God and the Devil with the same basicimplications. For what is man himself but an expression of divinity (God) in amaterial form (the Devil), and what is matter but the medium through whichdivinity must eventually manifest in all its glory? But when that takes place,matter will no longer be a controlling factor but simply a medium of expression.The battle is therefore on between the form side of life and the soul. TheDweller on the Threshold (the threshold of divinity, my brothers) is humanityitself with its ancient habits of thought, its selfishness and greed. Humanitytoday stands face to face with the Angel of the Presence—the Soul Whose natureis love and light and inclusive understanding. The great problem today is whichof these two will emerge the victor out of the conflict, and which of these twogreat agencies of life will determine humanity’s future and indicate the waywhich humanity will decide to go.The issues at stake are clear to all right-thinking people. Intolerance and anintense national pride and self-satisfaction can blind men to the facts of thecase today, but there are enough people thinking clearly to make the future ofright decision more probable than at any previous time in the history of therace.Preparation for World GoodwillThe causes of the present war are ancient. This historical sequence of thepredisposing factors can be clearly traced in the exoteric records of allnations as well as in the esoteric records of the Hierarchy. The inherent human[138] qualities which have led to the development of the present war are wellknown. All who are conscious of and observers of the war within their ownnatures, between personality selfishness and the selflessness of the soul, areaware of the implications and the correspondences. Where then lies the solution?What must be done to arrest the fires of hate and of aggression, of revenge andof fear? What also must be done to prepare for that time when the rebuilding ofthe world of men and the inauguration of the new and better civilisationarrives? With this we might now briefly deal.As regards active participation in the work to be done in preparing the worldfor the expression of goodwill, there is little to be done of an active exotericnature at this time; it is necessary to wait with patience and to see what isgoing to happen and along what lines the activity of the nations will run. Butthere is very much to be done of an esoteric and a preparatory nature and it isthis which I seek to impress upon your minds.Up to date and in spite of appearances, the Forces of Light are victorious andare definitely holding things steady. It is for this reason that nothing has yetquenched the spirit of goodwill and of sympathetic understanding which existsamong the peoples of all nations, not excluding Germany; this has been theoutstanding significant characteristic of the present conflict. There is littlehate or vindictiveness to be found, and this fact constitutes the differencebetween this war and the last, in 1914. It indicates a triumph for the Forces ofLight and in it lies the hope of the future. It is here, however, that the timefactor must be considered, for a prolonged war may cause a change in thisdesirable attitude, and much drastic experience may produce deep psychologicaland unavoidable changes in human thought and action. This must be consciouslyoffset. It has not yet occurred but it could happen and if it does much pain,terror, fearful anticipation, suffering and the agony entailed by the sight ofsuffering might eventually turn this goodwill into a [139] dynamic spirit ofhate and revenge unless it is definitely and consciously offset. Groups who areadhering to the principles of the Forces of Light, who are bending every effortto end the spirit of aggression and to rid the world of the focal points formaterial influence and power, must yet carry forward the task of binding men andwomen of every nation together in a spirit of loving understanding; they mustinterpret nation to nation in terms of brotherhood and of the new order.This is no easy thing to do at this time. The astral or emotional bodies ofhuman beings (which constitute the astral body of humanity as a whole) are todayin a state of chaos, and are swept by ancient desires, ancient and deep-seatedselfish attitudes and by ancient hatreds. The task is also complicated by theactivity of the mental processes of man which is characterised by pronounced anddeveloped illusions, by separative attitudes and by specious arguments. Butthere are, at the same time, enough people in the world who are responsive tothe spirit of goodwill, of tolerant understanding, and animated by a desire forpermanent right human relations.I have earlier suggested to you (A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol.II (EsotericPsychology), page 647.) that it should be possible to have—at a later date—aworld-wide recognition of a Day of Forgetfulness, of Forgiveness and ofFulfilment of the Biblical injunction to “forget the things which lie behind andto press forward” into the New Age, the new relationships and the newcivilisation. For that time we can all begin to plan, and to work for thatpsychological moment wherein this idea can be presented. It will comeimmediately after the cessation of hostilities. But today and in every land,where possible, the peoples must be educated in this expression of humansynthesis and human interrelation.It involves, however, an emphasising of the values to which I have referredearlier in this article. This is humanity’s [140] joint responsibility becauseof humanity’s general mistakes, and the ancient wrong attitudes and controls. Itinvolves, consequently, a stepping down from the position of critics andassigners of responsibility to that of a joint shouldering of the stupendoustask of changing present conditions and of instituting those reversals of policywhich will make a united world order possible and beautiful. This is no easytask. It is one which calls all men and women of goodwill in the world today andchallenges them to prepare whilst the conflict is on for what can be done whenit is over.I have given much in the past which can provide a platform of objectives and ofmethods. Nothing that I have outlined is now abrogated; only fulfilment ispostponed. For seven critical years, it lay in the hands of the spirituallyminded men of the world, in the hands of the Churches in all lands and of themen of goodwill and of the world aspirants so to work that the present conflictcould have been avoided. But the spirit of Christ was lost in clericalorganisation; emphasis has been laid upon technical theology; the spirit ofgoodwill was not expressed dynamically and practically, but theoretically andnegatively; the aspirants of the world had no true sense of values but werecontent to give a little time to the spiritual life and to other people, butmuch time was lost in individual, personal aims. A spirit of inertia settleddown upon the better inclined and upon the more understanding people; nothingthat we could do served to arouse them to powerful action or to sacrificepersonal temporary values to the lasting and universal values. The individualremained more important to himself than did the good of the whole.Be not over-distressed, my brothers. You are not alone in this but part of avast number, if that is to you any real satisfaction.But a renewed opportunity lies in front of you and it is of a practical nature,falling into definite spheres of work and of planned activity. You are asked,first of all, to [141] prepare for the great opportunity which will come at theclose of this conflict, and1. To explain clearly to all people the cause which produces the opportunity andwhich is dedicated to the ending of the present state of affairs.2. To engineer some dramatic and universal event which will serve as theinspiration and the inauguration of the new era of goodwill and of right humanrelations.Secondly, to keep up a steady process of right thought, right interpretation ofcurrent events and a right preparation whilst the war lasts, so that anyweakening of the gained spirit of goodwill can be immediately offset, and sothat understanding can grow in potency and not suffer obscuration. In order tobring this about, the following activities are suggested beginning with thosewhich concern the individual worker.1. A close personal watch over every word said or written, so that nothing saidor written by any of you will have in it hate or bias of the wrong kind and yourminds and hearts will be kept clear of all undesirable reactions. This is thepersonal and practical thing to do and the difficult task set before each of youwho read my words.2. Study and apprehend clearly the issues which lie behind this conflict, sothat there is no inner wavering as to the rightness of the side on which yourinterests lie—the side of the Forces of Light. Parallel this with anunderstanding appreciation of the problem of those who are bewildered by theemphasis and the dynamic activities of those through whom the Forces ofmaterialism are working. At the same time, also, kill out all hateful criticismin your minds.3. Endeavour to use the following formula or mantram every day. It is amodernised and mystically worded version [142] of the one which was used widelyin Atlantean days during the period of the ancient conflict of which the presentis an effect. For many of you this mantram will be in the nature of a recoveryof an old and well-known form of words:“The sons of men are one and I am one with them. I seek to love not hate: I seekto serve and not exact due service. I seek to heal, not hurt.“Let pain bring due reward of light and love. Let the soul control the outerform and life and all events, and bring to light the love which underlies thehappenings of the time. Let vision come and insight; let the future standrevealed. Let inner union demonstrate and outer cleavages be gone. Let loveprevail. Let all men love.”These words may seem inadequate, but said with power and an understanding oftheir significance and with the potency of the mind and heart behind them, theycan prove unbelievably potent in the life of the one who says them. They willproduce also an effect in his environment, and the accumulated effects in theworld, as you spread the knowledge of the formula, will be great and effective.It will change attitudes, enlighten the vision and lead the aspirant to fullerservice and to a wider cooperation based upon sacrifice. My brothers, you cannotevade the sacrifice in the long run, even if you have evaded it until now.4. Then apply yourselves to the spreading of the use of the Great Invocation andhelp to carry forward the plan for distribution. The Great Invocation, as youwill see in the next article which I am writing for your information, is apotent solar instrument designed to bring about changes and neededreadjustments. It is so powerful that when it was suggested for general use inthe world of men some opposition was evoked among the members of the Hierarchybecause They feared its potent effects upon the unready, and undeveloped people.Its use has, however, been justified [143] and it is desired that its usefulnessshould be very greatly increased and its use far more widely spread.5. I would have you in your own way prepare for a major spiritual effort whichis to take place when this conflict has worn itself out and some measure ofpeace and calm has come about. Each of you has your own sphere of influence andof contacts and each of you is in touch with similarly minded or enquiringpeople, with groups and churches, clubs, organisations and societies which arepledged to some form of effort towards human betterment, of goodwill effort, andof endeavour of some kind towards human welfare. Now is the time for much workto be done with the leaders and senior workers in such groups and with peoplewho can be prepared by each of you for active effort when the right time comes.To this task I call each of you. Later you can swing these people into activegoodwill work and to effort which will tend to world understanding and fusion.You can with them bring about the healing of the wounds of humanity which willbe greatly needed and for which you can now prepare. You can get in touch withsuch people, keep records of names and addresses and capacity to serve and help,establish group contacts and so systematise your work that when the call goesout (as it did in 1936) there will be found available to the organisers a wealthof ready contacts and of interested and prepared people who will then workintelligently to establish the new order.6. The instructions in my earlier pamphlets remain as before and should becarefully followed in preparation for a campaign at the close of hostilities.Mailing lists can be gradually brought alive by judicious correspondence and newlists can be compiled; the Great Invocation can be increasingly used if themethod outlined by me is studied and rightly organised by each of you, and sothe goodwill already present in the world can be brought to a point of dynamiclivingness, ready for later use. But, my brothers, nothing can be done unlessyou do it. [144]THE GREAT INVOCATIONStanza OneLet the Forces of Light bring illumination to all mankind.Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.So let it be and help us to do our part.October 1939In my last article, I suggested giving you some facts anent the Great Invocationand some explanation of its significance and meanings. These may enable theoccult students in the world today to use it with greater fervour and withgreater understanding and, consequently, with greater success.There are several such mantric formulas and Words of Power in use by suchstudents but they fail to accomplish very much because the person using them hasno real understanding of their import and purpose and is usually so focussed inhis emotional, aspirational, astral nature that all that he says and does (inconnection with such Words of Power) is entirely innocuous and futile. Words ofPower, ancient mantrams (such as the Lord’s Prayer) and the Great Invocation areonly effective if used upon the mental plane and with the power of a controlledmind—focussed on their intent and meaning—behind the spoken effort. They thenbecome potent. When said with the power of the soul as well as with the directedattention of the mind, they automatically become dynamically effective.Students all the world over have for years used the Sacred Word, and havesounded the O.M. with great diligence. I would like here to ask: With whatresults? I myself will reply. With practically no results except a slightstimulation of the aspiration and a small awakening of the creative imagination.This means that the results achieved have had effect only within the aura of theperson concerned and have not penetrated into his environment or produced anyrecognisable effects. The O.M. is potent and [145] dynamically effective whenrightly used and will produce changes, destroy that which must be eliminated orended, and will build in, by attraction and consolidation that which is desiredinto the fabric of the group life , producing incidentally (though none the lesscertainly) needed changes and the wise reconstruction of the individual life.Ponder upon this.If the above is true of the O.M. and of its group effects, it is infinitely moretrue of the Great Invocation. Words of Power (and this is true also of the O.M.)are all of second ray origin. This is the ray of the manifestation ofconsciousness. They are, therefore, intended for soul use because the soul isthe expression of the second aspect of divinity, and only the soul can reallyemploy these Words and sounds and thus produce the desired results which arealways in line with the divine Plan. It is frequently forgotten that they mustbe used by the soul in a dynamic manner, involving the serious recognition ofthe will aspect. The Great Invocation, the O.M. and all such Words of Power mustgo forth from the soul (whose nature is love and whose purpose is solely groupgood), backed by or “occultly propelled forth” (to use a translation of analmost untranslatable occult idea) by the dynamic will aspect, and carriedoutwards as an integrated thoughtform upon a stream of living, illumined mentalsubstance. This process therefore brings into activity the will, the love andthe intelligence of the man who is using these words and formulas. Frequently,however, an hiatus occurs even when a man has integrated these three controllingfactors within himself as far as he is able to do so at his particular point inevolution. All that he has succeeded in doing is the retaining of the createdthoughtform upon the mental plane; he fails to make its presence felt upon thephysical plane and to achieve the desired results because his brain (the lowerreceiving and distributing centre within the head) is incapable of the neededdual activity—retaining awareness of the intent, meaning and purpose of theformula being used and, at the same time, carrying on the task of sending forththe potency, [146] hidden yet conveyed by the Words or sounds. These twoactivities must be carried on simultaneously by the soul on its own planethrough the medium of the mind and the brain. Here again is one of theobjectives of all meditation work but one which is not emphasised as it is asequential happening and not an objective. Effectiveness is, therefore,dependent upon a grasp of the above facts and a developed and trainedintegration between soul, mind, desire, brain and the spoken Word or sound.What I am here telling you refers not only to the use of the Great Invocationbut also to the daily and constant use of the Sacred Word by occult students andaspirants in their daily meditation. They could change their lives, reorienttheir life purpose and focus, and achieve spiritual unfoldment and expansion ifthey could use the OM as it should be used. The Great Invocation, rightly usedby the many hundred thousand people who have already attempted to use it, couldreorient the consciousness of humanity, stabilise men in spiritual being,disrupt and rebuild the planetary thoughtform which men have created in the pastand which has had (and is having) such disastrous and cataclysmic results, andopen the door into the New Age, thus ushering in the new and bettercivilisation. This could be done so rapidly, that the needed changes would comeabout almost overnight; the present reign of horror would end and the race ofmen could settle down to a life of group goodwill, individual harmlessness andright human relations.Nevertheless, for your encouragement, I would state that the use of it hasmaterially hastened world events, even though it has definitely stirred up agreat deal of the trouble and brought it into manifestation upon the physicalplane. The basically selfish purpose (even if unrecognised) of those who haveused the Great Invocation has served to stimulate the selfish purposes of theforces of materialism. I would ask you: How many used the Great Invocation in apurely detached, spiritually potent and fully understanding manner? The meresthandful. How many sent forth the Great Invocation in a spirit of pure love andwith a completely [147] unbiased attitude? Very few indeed. How many sounded itout through the medium of a controlled mind, with a recognition and deep beliefthat it embodied the will of the planetary Logos and must, therefore, becomedynamically effective upon the physical plane? Hardly more than a tiny handful.Most of those who used it were intrigued by its novelty, or felt it to becomprehensive though in an unrealisable manner, or considered it must beoccultly effective because they heard that it emanated from a member of theHierarchy, was used by the occult Hierarchy of the planet, and was endorsed bythose they trusted, or because—foremost reason of all—anything that could makethe world nicer, more comfortable, happier and provide eventually easier livingconditions must be at least tried; it did not take long to say and was probablywell worth doing. But the dynamic power behind the effort in individual caseshas often been personal self-interest, distress at the existing terrible andunhappy world conditions and an emotional reaction at pain and horror and fear.In many ways, this has been a normal reaction to world tension and was to beexpected. The standard that I have indicated above is, I well know, too high andtoo impossible for the average aspirant, and most people are average. But theworld need is such that they must now swing out of the normal and, for the sakeof service, heighten their consciousness and work more definitely from a higherplane of awareness.I am seeking today all over the world for a group of aspirants and disciples whocan and will use the Great Invocation in the right way and who will be willing,consequently, to be trained to do so. In this way there will be a group upon thephysical plane and in everyday life who will be able to combine their effortswith those of the Hierarchy and thus produce an effective use of the GreatInvocation with its stupendous results.I would remind you that for the purpose of developing human will and humanfreedom of action, motivated by group consciousness, the Hierarchy chooses toproduce the desired unfoldments and changes upon the physical plane [148] onlythrough the medium of a conscious and awakening humanity. Such a humanity (andit is rapidly coming to this state of awareness through joint pain andsuffering) will be impressed by and responsive to the directed thought of theguiding Elder Brothers of the race, but will be free at all times to reject thatimpression and to proceed as they personally may choose. There is noauthoritative control over the minds of men assumed or cultivated by theHierarchy; all aspirants and disciples are free to choose a different way to theone suggested if they so prefer, or if they are unconvinced of the advisabilityof the indicated method of work, or fear the arduous task of carrying forwardthe stage of the plan which has been indicated to them, or if they shirk thediscipline implied and required by those who seek to make man correctlyresponsive to spiritual contact and teaching and so able rightly to interpretthe intent of the Hierarchy.Ability to use the Great Invocation so that it may be effective can be developedif those who are working along the lines of true meditation can make a beginningby the right use of the Sacred Word, which does not require such a sustainedeffort in occult concentration. They must learn to breathe it forth in themanner I have indicated above when speaking of the Great Invocation, and mustalso learn to gauge its results in their individual lives, thus viewing thoselives from the angle of the trained spiritual Observer.I would like to touch briefly and for a few minutes upon the significance of theentire process and method of invocation.Much has been said and written in the past by the curious investigator and bythose engaged in magical work of any kind anent the use of invocation as itapplies to elemental forces and subhuman agents, with the consequent evocationof active agents and responsible energies of some kind or another upon thephysical plane. What is oft forgotten is that this process consists entirely ofthe production of contact and subsequent control of the forces of earth, water,fire and air. This is one of the aims of the magical [149] workers but itconcerns material nature and the control of substance and, in the realm of thelower occultism, is allied to the invocation and evocation of money, good healthand the tangible material results as practised in the realm of mysticism by manyschools of thought. Note this, for it holds a clue to the relation of occultismand mysticism upon the lower levels of consciousness and indicates the need ofboth groups to shift their focus of interest and their emphasis on to the higherand more spiritual values. The control of the natural forces and the evocationof the desired material rewards will arrive normally and inevitably but assecondary effects; they will depend also upon the karma or destiny of manrecognised and considered, and the man will escape the danger of being himselfcontrolled and motivated by the forces of materialism, letting in—as thiscondition must—much that is evil and dangerous.The invocation, evocation and resultant activity of the Hierarchy and of thoseForces, Energies and Beings Who are not controlled by matter in any way, or bysubstance (the lower pole of manifestation) but Who are related to the positivespiritual pole is a new activity, and as yet relatively an untried experiment onthe part of humanity and the formulas unknown. Of what use was it to impart theformulas to humanity when it was as yet controlled by the lower values andunable to lay hold upon the soul aspect and to function on that level ofconsciousness whereon the soul is found. Only those can use the formulaseffectively who live, work, think and feel as souls, which means ever in groupterms.Today, however, there are those in every land who are rapidly becoming aware ofthe soul as a controlling factor in consciousness, who respond to world affairsand conditions increasingly as souls, and who can, therefore, be trained to workupon the physical plane. When this is so, it becomes possible to impart certainof these Words of Power and mantrams and to institute that new and potentactivity which will bring the Hierarchy and Humanity into conscious and directcooperation, as well as Shamballa and certain great [150] Forces which areinterplanetary or solar, and also great cosmic Energies. It is now possible todiscover those who—being free within themselves and who are learning rapidly tobe detached and selfless—can institute and carry forward the task of invokingthese higher spiritual forces, thus reinforcing the efforts of the Great WhiteLodge. It is this process of spiritual invocation which will motivate the newand coming world religion. This is not magical invocation, as man understandsit, and which is concerned with the invocation and control of the substantialand elemental forces of the manifested world, but the invocation which willevoke contact with the spiritual Lives and the divine embodied Energies as wellas with the Hierarchy (which is Their intermediary) in order to bring about themanifestation on earth of the soul of humanity and the qualities of thesubjective and inner divine life which all outer forms veil. This is now for thefirst time possible in the life of the planet.The objective of these processes of invocation is threefold:1. To invoke the soul of humanity and so bring about its freer expression uponthe physical plane. This can be brought about in two ways:a. The stimulation of the souls of men everywhere by the increased inflow of theChrist principle of love, which will express itself in world understanding,goodwill, cooperation, and peace.b. The setting up of a vibration within humanity itself of such potency that itwill magnetically attract a response from the waiting, watching Hierarchy andbring about a much closer and likewise conscious rapport between the twoplanetary centres, the Hierarchy and Humanity.This is called the invocation of the Great White Lodge. Much of this invocationof the Christ principle is carried forward by true believers in all lands(Christian and non-Christian) who address themselves to the Christ, no matterunder what name they recognise Him and then, with love in their hearts to Himand their fellowmen, seek to ameliorate [151] world conditions, end hatred andmisery and demonstrate goodwill everywhere. This refers to the first stage ofevoking the response to love and understanding in human hearts and minds as theresult of the invocation of the Christ and of the Christ principle. Ponder onthese words and see on every hand the process going forward. Esoteric studentsare apt to overestimate the effectiveness of the work that they are doing. Thefocussed aspiration and the unselfish struggle to serve which characterisesmillions of people in the world who do pray to, follow and seek to invoke thegreat spiritual head of the Hierarchy, the Master of all Masters, the Christ,has now reached a point of true and real effectiveness. It may be, and usuallyis, untinged by much mental activity or intellectual perception of theimplications or the scientific nature of their procedure but is, for that veryreason, potent. Esoteric and occult students demonstrate almost unavoidably adivided focus, owing to the activity of the mind and their failure as yet toblend perfectly both soul and personality. This leads to the dissipation ofenergy and oft renders their good intent futile. But, out of these groups arerapidly emerging those who can work in the right way and the results will beincreasingly effective.The evocation of the Hierarchy through right invocation is proceeding alsorapidly, producing much activity and response from the Hierarchy of Light.2. To set up a closer relation with the third, major divine centre on ourplanet, Shamballa. From that centre, the will of God goes forth and the power ofGod becomes the messenger of His will. Hitherto that highest form of spiritualenergy has only reached humanity (as I have before told you) via the Hierarchy.Today, it is deemed desirable that it should be ascertained whether there areenough selfless and group-conscious people upon the planet to warrant a directinflow of that higher energy to humanity, thus producing upon the physical planea hastening of the divine plan and a more rapid working out of that which is tobe. This direct contact can be produced if the Great Invocation [152] is used bythe world aspirants and disciples in collaboration with the Hierarchy. Hence theemphasis I have laid upon all of you using this Great Invocation as souls and asthose who are in touch in some small measure with the Hierarchy. When the noteof humanity and the note of the Hierarchy are synchronised by the use of theGreat Invocation, there will come a dynamic and immediate response fromShamballa, and that will rapidly take place which the Hierarchy and the worlddisciples desire to see.The primary result of the correct use of the Great Invocation (as far ashumanity is concerned) is acceleration. As I have also earlier pointed out, suchan acceleration carries with it its own risks, and consequently we have theappearance of the truly terrific problems and the dire happenings which have formany years overtaken the aspirants and the disciples in the world. They are bythis process learning the work of world salvage and becoming gradually fittedfor the post of world saviour and to be absorbers of evil karma. You might herequite correctly point out that all the world is now suffering and that the pasttwenty-five years have been those of a general and most unhappy world karma.Wherein then lies the distinction between the pain and suffering of the world ingeneral and that of aspirants and disciples in particular? I would reply thataspirants and disciples are conscious of this karma and its results in all threevehicles simultaneously—in the mind as well as in the emotional body withresultant physical reactions. This produces an intensification, retrospectionand anticipation which the larger group does not register, involving as it doesthe entire personality. To this, in the case of the disciple in particular, mustbe added sensitivity and the ability to tune in and to absorb world pain, worldreactions, and world conditions, thereby greatly increasing that which they mayhave individually to bear. The capacity to shoulder and register group pain aswell as to bear his own personal karma greatly aggravates the disciple’s task.When, therefore, I call the world aspirants and disciples to the use of theGreat Invocation, I call them also to the [153] “fellowship of Christ’ssufferings”; this is ever preliminary to the resurrection or to the release ofthe human consciousness into higher realms of spiritual awareness. The Forceswhich are contacted by the use of this Great Invocation, in conjunction withtrained hierarchical effort, are thereby attracted or magnetically impelled torespond and then potent energies can be sent direct to the waiting planetarycentre, Humanity. Two effects of an immediate nature are consequently inducedover a specific period of time:a. The energy of the Will of God serves to awaken the illumined but latentwill-to-good in men and this, once dynamically awakened, will flower forth asgoodwill. There is so much of this which remains latent and unexpressed becausethe will to demonstrate goodwill activity has not been aroused; it will beautomatically aroused in the general public once the world disciples haveinvoked and evoked the inflow of this higher dynamic energy. Humanity awaitsthis and its arrival is dependent upon the efforts of those who know what shouldbe done and who should now make their spiritual theories facts in outerexpression. Nothing can arrest the eventual progress of this will-to-good andits planned activity any more than a bud which has started to unfold its petalsin the light of the sun and subject to the proper stimulation can revert againto the condition of a tightly closed bud, potential but unexpressed. Theexpression of what has been potential will be the result of the impact of firstray force, of the will-to-good at this time, induced by the efforts of the worlddisciples.b. The second effect will be the forming or constitution of a planetary triangleor recognisable triad which will be the correspondence between the threeplanetary centres to the spiritual triad of Monad, Soul and Personality (theatma-buddhi-manas of the theosophical literature). Hitherto the word alignmenthas best described the planetary situation; there has been a straight line alongwhich energy has poured from Shamballa to the [154] Hierarchy and from theHierarchy to Humanity, but this has meant no direct interplay between Humanityand Shamballa. If the Great Invocation can be rendered effective, humanity canthen set up a direct relationship with Shamballa. The resultant triangle offorce-relationship will promote the circulation of spiritual energies betweenthe three centres from point to point so that there will be a triple relation. Aplanetary process of give and take between all three will then be established,and the emphasis upon giving will be far more pronounced.You will now see a little of the occult objective which lay behind the wordswhich I asked you all to repeat in connection with the Great Invocation:We know, O Lord of Life and Love,about the need;Touch our hearts anew with love,that we too may love and give.It is this thought of the free circulation of energy between the three worldcentres which motivates this mantric sentence. A study of this will show you howthe implication and significance of apparently simple words may be far deeperand far more wide-reaching in effect than you have been able to conceive. Arecognition of this and a creative impassioned use of the imagination may serveto add greater potency to your thought and to your personal will-to-good as youuse the Great Invocation and its subsidiary mantram. The keynote of the firstaspect is Sacrifice, and of the second, Love. The words therefore “that we toomay love and give” can produce a contact between the two.A clue also to the significance of pain and of suffering will gradually emergein the world consciousness as study is made of the above statements. Sufferingis the most effective and most rapid way of evoking world understanding and ofburning away the barriers which human beings have set up to the expression ofthe will-to-good. One of the most beneficent results of the inflow of theShamballa force through [155] the focussed demand of the aspirants and worlddisciples will be the intelligent recognition of the uses of pain and suffering.It is this truth—distorted and selfishly misapplied and interpreted—which hasled certain types of people and certain types of governing bodies among thenations to take the position that the greater the suffering inflicted (as, forinstance, in war time) and the greater the process of terrorism, the quicker theend which is desirable and right; they hold often that the more dire the effectsof planned conditions, the more rapidly will the correct consummation beachieved. It is not, however, the duty or right of man to turn first ray forceto selfish ends or material objectives; responsibility cannot be veiled behindspecious and distorted half truths and evil cannot be done in order that goodmay come. What is applied by the Lord of the World in Shamballa under themotivation of love, wisdom and selflessness with a sure touch and a judgment asto times and seasons cannot be so used by those motivated by personalityobjectives, either on an individual or a personality scale (for nations as wellas individuals have personalities). Ponder on this and seek enlightenment fromthe soul.3. When the Great Invocation is thus rightly used and the world centres areconsequently consciously interrelated, then certain extra-planetary Energies canbe called in by the Ruler of Shamballa to aid in the re-adjustments required forthe New Age and its coming civilisation. These Forces—spiritual and potent innature—exist in two categories: solar Forces which are inter-planetary andcosmic Forces which enter into our solar system via Jupiter as the transmitterof divine energies from Virgo and Aquarius which Jupiter esoterically governs.Virgo is esoterically the mother of the Christ child and is, therefore, theemanator of energies which nourish and aid the growth of the Christconsciousness; Aquarius is the coming expression of the group consciousnesswhich is the first and immediate revelation of the ever present Christconsciousness on a large scale in humanity. Jupiter also, exoterically and fromthe angle of orthodox [156] astrology, rules Sagittarius, the sign ofdiscipleship, and also Pisces, the sign of the world saviours. The implicationswill, therefore, be obvious to real students.In considering these great Energies, there is little you can do beyondaccepting—if you care to do so—my statements anent them, regarding them asinteresting and simply explanatory hypotheses. There is little that you can do(or I either) to arrive at first hand knowledge of the facts along this line.Few even of the Members of the Hierarchy are conscious of the impact of forcefrom extra-solar centres or reservoirs of spiritual force. Only the group ofContemplatives in the Hierarchy which are given the exoteric name ofNirmanakayas are responsive to Their influence in any conscious manner and thenonly when that influence has been stepped down by certain powerful agencies inShamballa. It is not necessary for me or for you to say more anent Them though Ishall touch upon Them again later in this article.Prior to taking up the Great Invocation sentence by sentence, I would likebriefly to touch upon the needed procedure as you attempt to say it correctlyand effectively:Forget not, first of all, the necessary process of alignment wherein you do twothings:1. Endeavour consciously (which for most of you at present means imaginatively)to align or link soul, mind and brain so that there is a direct and free inflowfrom the higher Self to the lower.2. Endeavour to realise or register your relation to the Hierarchy, via your owngroup of disciples (if you know which it is) or in relation to whichever one ofthe Great Ones or Masters appeals the most to your heart and mind. If neithermakes any appeal to your consciousness, the same results will be achieved if youseek to link up with the Christ.I might here point out that the difference between the linking up that you caneffectively do and that which is done by a Member of the Hierarchy itself isthat you link up [157] via the Hierarchy and then through the medium of theGreat Invocation reach forth to Shamballa whereas the initiates and the Masterslink Themselves directly with Shamballa and use the Great Invocation in a mannertotally different to that in which you use it. There is for you and the averageaspirant no direct contact, and that is definitely fortunate for you. I may notfurther elucidate.The second thing which you do is then to focus yourself in as high aconsciousness as you are capable of achieving. Then you aim at completeself-forgetfulness and when that has been gained you direct your attention tothe dual activity of the true disciple to which I earlier referred, i.e., thetask of emphasising a significant understanding of the implications and meaningsof the words said and of the results to be achieved. There comes next thesending forth of the words with their hidden potency and this must be done byyou as a soul, using the mind and the brain as agents.Integration, conscious activity, and the expression of the work to be done uponthe physical plane will cover the entire story. These rightly carried forwardwill prove effective. Would it clarify matters for you if I state that:1. Integration is a correspondence in consciousness to the Inhalation of thebreath. This is the withdrawing of the consciousness to as high a point aspossible.2. Conscious activity corresponds to the right use of the Interlude betweeninhalation and exhalation. It involves the recognition of the forces contactedand their purpose.3. Right expression corresponds to the period of Exhalation. This is the sendingforth of the forces contacted by an act of the will in order that they mayproduce the desired ends.Forget not that this has to be a group endeavour and must be carried forward incooperation with the Hierarchy. It involves also the recognition that the soulis one and that there is no such thing as my soul—only our soul.In considering the five sentences which form what might [158] be called themandate of the Great Invocation (see page 144), I would like, first of all, topoint out a few underlying and basic ideas.This Great Invocation has been used by the Hierarchy ever since the year 1425A.D. though it is thousands of years older than that. Owing, however, to theunreadiness of humanity to cooperate in its use, the results have been delayedand are regarded as “hovering.” I know not how else to express the resultsalready achieved. Today, they can precipitate, if right cooperation can beextended by humanity, and such cooperation now seems immediately possible.The first phase, Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind,definitely invokes potencies which are to be found upon monadic levels ofconsciousness and upon what is occultly called the second plane of divinemanifestation. These Forces include the Lord of the World and theRepresentatives of the seven sacred planets Who are spoken of in the ChristianBible as the “seven Spirits before the Throne of God.” They include also thethree Agents of the Divine Triplicity Who are known, esoterically and in theEast as the three Kumaras, or the three Buddhas of Activity.What do these names and these great Individualities mean to you and to averagehumanity? Nothing at all and this is necessarily so. They remain but names andpossible hypothetical expressions of divinity until after the third initiationwhen the conscious recognition of the Monad becomes possible; then Forces andEnergies, personified for us in these great and stupendous Lives, can bedemonstrated as having true existence. On the way to these fundamentalrecognitions, Their three Representatives within the limits of the Hierarchymust be accepted and known to be correspondingly functioning Activities. TheseThree are, the Manu, the focal point of the first Ray of Will or Power; theChrist, the head of the Hierarchy and the representative of the second Ray ofLove-Wisdom; and the Lord of Civilisation, the expression of the third Ray ofActive Intelligence. [159] This knowledge is achieved during the process oftraining for the first three initiations. Therefore, all that I here tell youmust be regarded as possible of verification, and as being testified to by allthe world Scriptures and by the initiates of all lands, but it must necessarilyremain personally unverified by you until a much later date in your unfoldment.The Spirit of Peace Who is invoked in the second phrase, Let the Spirit of Peacebe spread abroad, is that mysterious and divine Entity with Whom the Christ cameinto touch and Whose influence played through Him at the time that He earned theright to be called the “Prince of Peace.” As I have elsewhere told you in myearlier writings, the Christ embodied in Himself the cosmic principle of love,the expression of which in manifestation will work out as “glory to God, peaceon earth and goodwill towards men.” To this the angels testified at His birth.When He expressed this principle of love in His life and world service, Hedefinitely linked up our planet and humanity (in particular) with the Source ofthe light, love and life to which we refer in this second phrase. This was theworld salvation which He brought—a fact which is as yet little realised andwhich will not be widely recognised until this powerful Invocation has taken dueeffect.When the world aspirants and disciples use this Invocation, the first phrasetakes the consciousness to the Hierarchy of Light, which is the intermediatecentre between Humanity and Shamballa. It serves then to emphasise and establisha close rapport, blending and fusing the human and the hierarchical centres.When this has taken place, the Hierarchy can then use this Great Invocation withgreater potency and can carry the relation to a higher state still and produce ablending with the Shamballa centre, where the Forces of Light are found asembodied Presences and where Their focussed energy serves to provide greatreservoirs of light and love. These have hitherto not been made available forplanetary distribution, owing to the lack of established relation between thethree centres: Humanity, Hierarchy and [160] Shamballa. That relation is nowbecoming somewhat established; the inflow of light and love to humanity is nowpossible if the disciples and aspirants of the world can be led to make theneeded effort to stand in spiritual being and, from that poised attentiveattitude, to invoke these great Entities. It was to this possibility that thestory in the New Testament refers where reference is made to the pool which wasstirred at times by the Angel and thus a condition was produced which led to thehealing of the sick. The Angel of the Presence, the soul of humanity, asembodied in the Hierarchy and those who are consciously endeavouring to functionas souls can now stir these reservoirs of force and light upon etheric levels inShamballa so that a definite “healing of the nations” can take place.When the thought behind the Great Invocation can be carried high enough in theconsciousness of those using it through a joint effort of the world disciplesand the Hierarchy of Light—as well as being reinforced by the Forces ofLight—then the Spirit of Peace can be invoked.On a lower turn of the spiral, you will note that the Wesak Festival enacts asimilar invocation and process. It is a re-enacting and training process. Thereand at that time, the three Representatives of Shamballa within theHierarchy—the Manu, the Christ and the Mahachohan—invoke the Buddha, Who in Histurn is the transmitter of still higher Forces. He is invoked by a specialmantram and transmits the appeal to the One Whose agent He is. If this GreatInvocation which we are studying can be rightly said, the three great planetarycentres can be related in a similar manner. The Lord of Civilisation, the MasterR., representing humanity, the Christ representing the Hierarchy and the Lord ofthe World, linked through the Manu and representing Shamballa can be broughtinto a close relation so that the result will be the setting up of such a potentvibration and note that the Spirit of Peace will be invoked and contacted. Bythe voiced appeal His attention will be forced to turn itself towards ourplanet. The consequences will be significant and potent but as to the form whichthey [161] will take it is impossible for me to say. Perhaps it will lead tosome peculiar and powerful demonstration of the meaning of peace as theexpression of universal and planetary love; perhaps it will produce the sendingof an Avatar or Messenger of Peace to lead the nations to right action; perhapssome happening will take place of such significance that its import will beimmediately recognised by humanity as a whole, leading them to take all theneeded steps to restore right human relations. The nature of the activitieswhich the Spirit of Peace will institute is not our responsibility. Our duty isto learn rightly to contact the Hierarchy, via our own souls; rightly to use theGreat Invocation as souls, and rightly to render ourselves responsive to andsensitive to the resultant effects. Ponder on the above.It might, therefore, be noted that the Forces of Light express Themselvesthrough the Hierarchy of Light and Their major effect is the illumination of theminds of men with love and light. This precipitates upon the mental plane. Thepersonality or the form aspect of humanity is thereby pervaded and illumined.Thus the third great planetary centre, Humanity, becomes creative and magnetic,and two divine aspects—intelligence and love—will reach fruition upon thephysical plane, making it possible for the first aspect and the will of God(understood by humanity as the Plan) to be consciously carried forward on earthin conformity with the activity instituted at Shamballa. The will of God ispurpose and this is, for the first time, to be recognised consciously by man.The Spirit of Peace will, when the right time comes, vitalise the responsivenessof humanity, via the influence of the Hierarchy, to the will of God which hasfor basic intent the bringing of peace on earth. What is peace? It isessentially the establishing of right human relations, of synthetic rapport withits resultant cooperation, of correct interplay between the three planetarycentres and an illumined, loving understanding of the will of God as it affectshumanity and works out divine intent. It is for this reason that the Christ, Whoestablished for the first time in planetary history a [162] contact between theHierarchy, Humanity, Shamballa and the Spirit of Peace in His Own high place, inHis first recorded utterance said that He must be about His Father’s businessand then at the end of His life, reiterated the same thought in the words:“Father, not my will but Thine be done,” thus carrying the thought up to thehighest plane for He addressed the Father, the first Aspect of Divinity. He thenfocussed in Himself the two major divine attributes and aspects—will and love(atma-buddhi)—and because of this, His consciousness became extra-planetary asis the consciousness of the Lord of the World, and He could then touch certainheights of awareness and contact certain solar Agencies which had never beforebeen contacted by man. This achievement enabled Him to put Humanity in touchwith the Spirit of Peace. He thus Himself became the Light of the World and thePrince of Peace.In this manner, Shamballa and the Hierarchy were brought into a closerelationship and two great streams of force were blended and a definiteinterplay set up between them. The Buddha, through His achievement ofillumination, established the first major link with the Forces of Light. TheChrist, through His ability to express the will of God in love and as worldsalvage, established the first major link with the Spirit of Peace.If you will study the above information with care, you will find that theimportance of the Wesak Festival at the time of the full moon of May will assumeincreasing importance in your minds. It is the festival at which three factorsof importance to humanity are brought into relation:1. The Buddha, the embodiment or agent of the Forces of Light can then becontacted and that which They seek to transmit to humanity can be consciouslyappropriated.2. The Christ, the embodiment of the love and the will of God and the agent ofthe Spirit of Peace, can also be contacted and humanity can be trained toappropriate this extra-planetary type of energy. [163]3. Through the Christ and the Buddha, humanity can now establish a closerelationship with Shamballa and then make its own contribution—as a worldcentre—to the planetary life. Pervaded by light and controlled by the Spirit ofPeace, the expression of humanity’s will-to-good can emanate powerfully fromthis third planetary centre. Humanity will then for the first time enter uponits destined task as the intelligent, loving intermediary between the higherstates of planetary consciousness, the super-human states and the sub-humankingdoms. Thus humanity will become eventually the planetary saviour.If you will have these thoughts in mind, the first three phrases of the GreatInvocation will assume great significance. Let me put some of thesesignificances in tabular form:Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankindIntermediary The Hierarchy. Soul consciousness Agent The Buddha ExpressionLight. Understanding. The illumined mind Planes of emphasis The second ormonadic plane The buddhic or intuitional plane The mental plane Focal point Thehead centre Planetary centre The HierarchyLet the Spirit of Peace be spread abroadIntermediary Shamballa. Spiritual consciousness Agent The Christ Expression Thewill of God as love and peace Sentient response Planes of emphasis The logoic orfirst plane The buddhic, or intuitional plane The astral or emotional planeFocal point The heart centre Planetary centre ShamballaMay men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation [164]Intermediary Humanity itself. Self-consciousness Agent The Lord of CivilisationExpression Intelligent love, dedicated to the Plan Creativity The will-to-goodPlanes of emphasis The atmic or plane of spiritual will The mental plane Thephysical plane Focal point The throat centre Planetary centre HumanityThus all the great centres are linked and all the planes are interrelated; thepast has contributed its finished work; the present is evoking its just andright development; the future of wonder and of divine possibility appears—itsresults contingent upon a spirit of right understanding and invocation. Threestatements in the New Testament begin now to demonstrate their profound esotericsignificance and their amazing living potency:I am the Light of the World The Forces of Light Phrase 1. 2nd Aspect My peace Igive unto you The Spirit of Peace Phrase 2. 1st Aspect Love thy neighbour asthyself The Men of Goodwill Phrase 3. 3rd AspectThe three aspects of divinity in man achieve practical expression through theinfluence of the Great Invocation, both in living usefulness and truecomprehension—true at least in so far as man’s present point in evolutionpermits of his correct apprehension of significance. Goodwill , as the practicaland possible expression of love demonstrates on earth, evoking rightrelationship; light , as the expression of the Hierarchy pours into the humanconsciousness, irradiating all dark places and evoking a response from all [165]forms of life in the three worlds of manifestation, and in the three subhumankingdoms through the medium of the human; peace , as the expression of the willof Shamballa produces balance, equilibrium, synthesis and understanding, plus aspirit of invocation which is basically an action, producing reaction. Thisdemonstrates as the first great creative and magical work of which humanity iscapable, swinging, as it does, all the three divine aspects into a simultaneousactivity in line with the will of God.We come now to the last two phrases which summarise the effects—synthetic andeternal (and consequently lasting) which the establishment of directrelationship with Shamballa will produce in the two other planetary centres, theHierarchy and Humanity. I refer to effects which will express themselves as agroup activity, motivated by the essential values of selflessness and persistenteffort (which is sustained concentration, in the last analysis) and therebyproducing conditions for which the Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days, haslong waited. The patience and sustaining love of Shamballa is infinite.The fourth phrase runs: May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote atthis time . As you know, the word “forgiveness” is a curious and unusual one andsignifies (according to the best derivative sources) simply “to give for.”Forgiveness is not therefore, a synonym for pardon though the word has beendistorted in theological circles to mean this, so little has the Churchunderstood the basic, motivating power behind divine expression in our solarsystem. Theologians ever think in terms of the human mind and not in terms ofthe divine mind. Forgiveness is sacrifice, and is the giving up of one’s self,even of one’s very life, for the sake of others and for the good of the wholegroup. This spirit of sacrifice is ever found when the Shamballa force isrightly contacted, even in the smallest degree, and the underlying impulsebehind the loving will of God is sensed and understood, accompanied as thisalways is with the desire to participate in that will and its spirit of divinesacrifice. Manifestation is itself the Great Forgiveness. The [166] stupendousLives—outside manifested existence—entered into manifestation in order to giveThemselves for the lesser lives and forms of existence in order that theselesser lives might be enabled to proceed onward towards a goal which is known toDeity alone, and thus eventually reach high places of spiritual expression.Achievement is ever followed by sacrifice and the giving of the greater for thelesser. This is an aspect of the Law of Evolution. Such is the note and theme ofthe entire creative process and is the basic meaning of the phrase, “God isLove,” for love signifies giving and sacrifice, at least in this solar system.It is for this reason that the esoteric teaching emphasises the fact that thesoul of man is a Lord of Sacrifice and of loving persistent Devotion—the twooutstanding qualities of the Shamballa Lives, sustaining life and giving. Thisis lasting devotion to the good of the whole or the expression of the spirit ofsynthesis and sacrifice in order again that all lesser lives (such as thoseembodied in the personality of man) may rise to the “resurrection which is inChrist,” through the crucifixion or sacrifice of the soul upon the Cross ofMatter.It is this thought again which gives significance to the life of Christ on earthfor He re-enacted for us an eternal process, externalising it in such a way thatit became the symbol of the motive of the entire manifested universe and theimpulse which should direct each of us—crucifixion and death, resurrection andlife, and the consequent salvation of the whole.It is this thought which is embodied in the challenge of this fourth phrase ofthe Great Invocation, and means literally, “May all men everywhere respond tothe keynote of the universe and give themselves for others.”And, is not this in a faint and dim manner, the present keynote of human effort?In spite of a real inability to think truly, effectively and intuitively, themass of men in all lands are responding clearly and definitely to this note ofsacrifice. Leaders of the great nations everywhere are using this note and callto sacrifice in their appeals at this time to [167] their peoples. Men inGermany were called to battle by their leaders with the challenge of sacrificeand told that they must give their lives in order that Germany may live. A studyof the speeches by the German leaders will be found to contain this note. Theother group, whom you call the Allies (because they stand more specifically forthe good of the whole and not for the good of the separated nation or unit) arealso calling the masses of their people to fight for the good of civilisationand for the preservation of those values which are next upon the evolutionaryscale and essential to the general good. The wording of these calls and theobjectives expressed may differ in formulation but the theme is the same and theeffect is to call forth the spirit of sacrifice in the nations. Though themotives behind such a call may be mixed and the leaders guided as much byexpediency and selfish, national interests as by the general good, yet they knowthat the note which will evoke an immediate response from the unit and theindividual is fundamentally the good of the larger unit (the nation or the groupof nations). Therefore, forgiveness or sacrifice in order to save others isincreasingly the recognised needed keynote at this time and in this recognitionlies much to justify the sorry story of past evolutionary processes and methods.When it is recognised that the “giving-for” involves right living upon thephysical plane and not (as is so often thought) the dying of the physical bodythen we shall see a revitalised world. It is the living Christ (the living worldSaviour) Who saves humanity. It is the sacrifice, day by day, in the process ofdaily living which can save the world of men—the sacrifice of selfish personalinterests for the good of the whole and the giving up of one’s practical life tothe salvage of the world. It is living in order that others too may live whichis the theme of the New Testament. When, therefore, the mode of sacrifice entersinto the realm of the subtler and subjective values and the true meaning offorgiveness is intellectually, practically and spiritually comprehended, the NewAge will be abundantly realised with its truly human civilisation and a culturewhich will embody [168] the realities of the esoteric teaching, as well as thebest of the externalised past. Then and only then will the new esotericism berevealed to a race of men who have made aspiration a fact in their outerexperience. The attitude of the masses in the present conflict is the guaranteeof this and the proof also of the success of Christ’s mission.The result of what is happening today must, sooner or later, produce anat-one-ment between all nations and peoples. At-one-ment is ever (underevolutionary law) the consequence of sacrifice. Of this, Christ’s sacrifice wasthe symbol and the guarantee, impulsed as His life and activities were by theSpirit of Peace. As He made “of twain, one new man, so making peace” (Ephesians2:15) so today out of the duality of soul and body, humanity is achieving thesame ends and the result of this final stage of the Piscean Age will be thefusion in consciousness of soul and body. The Aquarian Age will demonstrate anincreasing expression of this at-one-ment, wrought out in the crucifixion ofhumanity at the present time. The difference between this coming stage and thatof the past is that, in the past, the soul has sought this development andat-one-ment and (from the angle of evolution) it has been slowly and graduallyattained, but in the future, it will be consciously sought, achieved andrecognised by man upon the physical plane as a result of the present period of“giving-for” the whole, of the best which the individual can give.I would point out that just as the energies released by use of the first threephrases of the Invocation relate to the Head, Shamballa; to the Heart, theHierarchy; and to the Throat centre, Humanity; so the right use of this fourthphrase will bring into conscious, functioning activity the centre between theeyebrows, the ajna centre in individual man and in humanity as whole. Thiscentre begins to become active and to function dynamically, governing anddirecting the individual energies, once any real measure of personalityintegration has been achieved. It is, as you know, the fourth centre found abovethe diaphragm [169] in the human body and the phrase which awakens it (bothindividually and in the group) is this fourth phrase. There is, therefore, anumerical relationship. When used wisely and intelligently by human beings, manyof the blended potencies which the first three phrases have made available areinvoked and so made available to the individual as well as to the group. Theycan then be focussed for his use in the ajna centre. In many ways, therefore,this fourth phrase of the Great Invocation is of paramount importance to theindividual as well as to humanity, invoking as it does great and vital potenciesand indicating process (Sacrifice) and purpose, plus the identification of theunit and the group with the basic intent of manifestation.The fifth phrase, Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones, is definitelyrelated to the effect in the Hierarchy of a constructive use of the GreatInvocation, just as the previous one is related to the effect in humanity. Thiseffect in the Hierarchy is a relatively new one and is due to the participationof humanity in the process of invocation, thus producing new effects andcontacts. It is the united effort of the two great centres which is of suchparamount importance and upon which I desire to have you concentrate. Itsutterance by man throws the weight of human appeal and desire behind the age-oldefforts of the Hierarchy and this is now, for the first time, truly possible ona large scale. For aeons, the Hierarchy has struggled alone to help and lifthumanity and to stimulate the potency of the human planetary centre so that itsvibratory activity would eventually be sufficiently powerful to swing it intothe radius or magnetic field of hierarchical activity. This long task has atlast achieved success. The Hierarchy and humanity are at last en rapport. Thisis the higher reflection or correspondence to what goes on within theconsciousness of a human being who—having reached the stage of discipleship—isat the point of blending the light of the personality (as it is expressedthrough the ajna centre and its externalisation, the pituitary body) and thelight of the soul (as it is, in its turn, expressed [170] by the light in thehead, or by the head centre and its externalisation, the pineal gland).You will, therefore, note afresh the practical significance of these fourth andfifth phrases of the Great Invocation. One serves to arouse humanity (as aplanetary centre) to activity and realisation and the other serves to aid theHierarchy in its ancient efforts so that the two are then related to eachother’s magnetic fields and produce a blending and a synthesis which will leadto a fuller expression of the soul of divinity through the medium of humanity.Ponder on this statement.In the esoteric teaching, this takes place in the life of the individual when—byan act of the will—the centre at the base of the spine is aroused and the fireand the light of the personal threefold life (one aspect of which is oftencalled the kundalini fire) is carried upwards and merged with the power and thelight of the soul. The major approach of the two basic energies of form and soul(as an expression of spirit) are thereby related within the human being; the“marriage in the heavens” takes place and the task of the creative process ofincarnation or individual manifestation is on the way to completion. Within theplanetary life, the same process goes on. The life of humanity as a whole (whichis intelligent form life) and the life of the Hierarchy (which is the life ofthe soul), under impulse from the Spirit or will aspect as symbolised inShamballa, are fused and blended and then a new departure in the evolutionaryprocess becomes possible. The kingdom of God, which is the kingdom of souls, andthe human kingdom as mutually expressive and interrelated, are perfectlysynthesised and anchored on earth. The glory of the One can then be faintlyseen, which is the glory of Shamballa. The Dweller upon the threshold ofdivinity and the Angel of the Presence then stand face to face.This is the situation today. Tomorrow they will blend and synthesise and theglory of God will appear on earth. The second great Approach will have beenachieved. [171]CALL TO A UNITED ACT OF SERVICENovember 1939The situation is serious. Sea and air and land are arrayed against the Forces ofLight; they are the agents of material substance and can be used potentlyagainst the spiritual Forces. The forces of the air are, however, increasinglyon our side. The Members of the Hierarchy are hard put to it to turn the tide infavour of that true and more spiritual civilisation which is on the way. Thiscivilisation will be a combination of the best which has hitherto been producedand that which is new and, as yet, dimly sensed by the best of the worldthinkers. The tide must be turned in favour of that which we call righteousness.The seeds of evil are in every country; those who war against that which is goodare numerous in every land, whether they war with aggressive and planned intent,whether they preserve an attitude of passivity and acceptance, or a plannedneutrality, as in America, or are actively fighting for that which is againstthe material forces.The World Crisis was, as you know, inevitable, but physical warfare could havebeen avoided if right psychological methods had been employed, and it could havebeen cured if a process of transmutation and of transference had been correctlycarried forward, and if the spirit of sacrifice had also been demonstrated bythe world aspirants. The need for group sacrifice has not met with adequateresponse, except in those cases where it has been imposed by governments upontheir nationals. Such is the sorry history of what is taking place today.What can be done at the present moment to arrest defeat and the overwhelming ofthe Forces of Light? Here I refer not to the outer physical victory. Truevictory will not be indicated unless the higher values which should govern humancivilisation emerge with clarity and power. I would here like to emphasise thefact that the tide must be definitely turned before the close of the year if aprolonged conflict is to be avoided. I would ask you, therefore, to participate[172] in the subjective focussing and rallying of the world thinkers, andparticularly the heads of organisations, groups and churches of all kinds andtemperaments who can swing their many adherents into a uniform and unitedactivity.The Masters of the Wisdom have no time today to do the task Themselves; Theirhands are full, combating the forces of materialism. These forces are active inevery country; the Hierarchy in its consciousness does not isolate Germany, eventhough these forces have chosen that sad land for their major point of departureand enterprise; in Germany They have Their people working as elsewhere. TheMasters of the Wisdom are active in dispelling the depressions and terrors whichsettle down upon all Their workers in the arena of the world today, as theseworkers struggle to stand steady under the fierce impact of wrong thinking andof world-wide despair; these workers are likewise sensitive (owing to theirpoint of integrated development) to the agony of mind, the tension of emotionand the ravages of physical pain which are felt by all those upon whom the Warhas had its dire effects, and upon whom it has laid the hand of suffering. Sucha sensitivity and such a sympathetic response are apt to produce a condition ofnegativity and a psychic preoccupation with the immediate situation among allworkers, and thus render them deaf to the call of their actual duty or elseliable to become distraught by the dual effort of being effective in service,whilst at the same time fighting off emotional reactions. The capacity of theworker to respond, therefore, to the inner voices and to serve dispassionatelyand selflessly is seriously handicapped.I challenge all workers and all members of the New Group of World Servers toleave their personal problems behind. This is a time of crisis and such problemsmust be solved through complete self-forgetfulness. I ask you to work anew withfresh ardour in joyful service, forgetting past weaknesses and failures in theurgency of that which I ask all to do for the world. There has been much lack ofjoy in the service rendered to the world lately. When I speak thus, I refer notto happiness, which is a personality reaction, [173] but to that joyousconfidence in the law and in the Hierarchy which lies behind the Biblical words,“The joy of the Lord is our strength.” “Rise up and fight, Arjuna,” preservingthe flame of love intact, permitting no breath of hate to disturb the serenityof love or upset that inner poise which will enable you to sound forth theclarion note of world understanding, that will rally all men and women ofgoodwill to the aid of the Hierarchy. This will bring to an end all hatred,separativeness and aggression, which are the three major sins of humanity. Allmen have hated; all men have been separative in both thought and action; allhave been and many still are materialistic, full of pride and the desire to gainthat which is not their own by right. This spirit of acquisitiveness belongs tono one group; it has been a universal and general fault, and has produced thepresent disastrous economic situation, thus precipitating the world into war,hate and cruelty.The fusion of many minds into one directed activity is today of supremeimportance; this has been symbolised in the union which now exists between twogreat nations, France and Great Britain. Unity of directed thought and purposeis the guarantee of inevitable and future success. The power of massed thoughtis omnipotent. The potency of focussed and directed mental activity isunpredictable. If you accept this premise and this statement, then act upon it.The Spirit of Peace is hovering close to humanity, seeking opportunity to makeHis Presence felt. The Spirit of Peace is not an abstract concept but a potentIndividual, wielding forces hitherto unfamiliar to our planet. Great Forces areawaiting the hour when They can function as the Liberators and the Deliverers ofmankind. But the door to Their entrance must be opened by humanity itself and itwill be opened by a united act of the will, expressed through some formula ofwords and expressed in sound. It will be brought about by an activity performedsimultaneously by all men and women of goodwill and by all the world aspirantsand disciples. The door will not open unless the act of invocation is backed bythe focussed will. The [174] directed determination of the man or the group whois using the suggested formula, prayer or invocation is essential.I would ask you to call as many people as you can reach through the medium ofevery available channel to a definite activity upon the coming Christmas day, ifpossible, and again at the time of the full moon of January, thus making twogreat appeals to the Forces of Peace and Light, so that they may help humanity.I would ask you to get in touch with leaders and workers—important andunimportant—in every land, asking them to associate themselves in their own wayand with their own people, and to do this on as large a scale as possible—aslarge, at least, as that of your effort in May, 1936.The times are ripe for a response to these ideas; the recognised pain anddistress of the world will open both hearts and purses. The idea of a Christmasappeal and call to prayer and to invocation of the Prince of Peace will bepotent in evoking a desirable reaction, and will serve also to blend into closerunity all who recognise the work the Hierarchy is attempting to do. I would askyou to call for help from all sides, and to let these ideas work out into theworld on the basis of their usefulness and opportuneness. Omit from this appealnone that you know, for through them millions can be reached and swung into thedesired activity.To those of you who can appreciate and use the Great Invocation, I would suggestits renewed and earnest use. This alternative invocation might, however, besuggested and found useful:“O Lord of Light and Love, come forth and rule the world.May the Prince of Peace appear and end the warring of the nations.May the reign of Light and Love and Justice be begun.Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with us.”THE COMING WORLD ORDERApril 1940This analysis of world conditions is being written in America, where there is,as yet, relative physical safety and [175] time for the re-adjustment of views,and the opportunity also to give direction—along with embattled Britain and herAllies—to a world sorely needing guidance and vision. There is great confusionof voices. Those who know the least speak ever the loudest and apportion theblame for events with facility. There is much mental distress everywhere,occasioned by the war and also by the desire of the well-intentioned to stresstheir particular solutions of the world problem.It is necessary, therefore, to speak with directness, to indicate the inherentdangers of the present situation, to present its amazing opportunity to bringabout needed changes, and to point out the lines of demarcation between theright and the wrong ways of living, between a vision of the new world order andthe retrograde plans of the so-called “new order” with which the totalitarianpowers seek to bewilder humanity.We start with the premise that two opposing world visions confront humanity andthat two world orders are presented to mankind. Between these man must choose,and his choice will determine the future.The years 1941 and 1942 will be years of crisis and of tension. Those whoperceive the risks, the opportunity, and the important decision to be made arestruggling with almost frantic haste to awaken the masses to the uniqueness ofthis moment. What mankind decides during the next twelve months will conditionthe future as no other human decision has ever before done in the history ofmankind.There have been points of crisis before in history, but not one that involvedthe entire planetary population. There have been periods of danger, difficulty,war, famine and distress, but none which conditioned the lives of untoldmillions as does the present. Time and again there has been the emergence ofleaders, conquerors, dictators and world figures, but they have hitherto come ata time when their influence was limited by world communications and by nationallimitations; therefore their power was not universal and their progress wasarrested by the conditions of the [176] period in which they lived. Today, theentire planet is involved and all the nations of the world are definitelyaffected.There is the setting up of barriers in a futile effort to keep out of troubleand avoid war; dominant groups are swinging many nations under their banners sothat they are either associated with the totalitarian powers or with thosenations which are opposing them. The nations which are not actually belligerentsare equally active in the task of endeavouring to preserve their nationalintegrity.The conflict today is a world conflict. The following groups of people areinvolved:1. The fighting aggressor nations, ruled by ambitious dictators.2. The nations which are seeking to defend themselves and the liberties ofhumanity.3. The neutral nations, seeing the issues involved and faced with the immediatenecessity to take sides.The momentum of this struggle is gaining daily. Fresh areas of the world arebeing swept into the conflict every week. The real issues, the impendingeconomic results and the political implications are emerging with growingclarity in every land and—make no mistake—even in those lands which lie numbedand suffering under the heel of the conqueror. Among them there is a silent andat present voiceless revolt. The inner speechless revolt in itself constitutes amenace to world peace and, if evoked into full expression, may plunge the worldstill deeper into conflict.Facing humanity today are two major dangers. These are: first, the conflict willbe so prolonged that humanity will be completely exhausted, and thus a stalematewill be reached and a situation will arise which will bring to an end allcivilised relationships and all hope of an ordered life of beauty, peace andculture. Secondly, the nations not yet involved will fail to see the realitiesof the situation and will not come to the assistance of those fighting for thepreservation of national and individual freedom. If this [177] should prove tobe the case, then—without so intending and yet inevitably—they will stand on theside of evil and share in the responsibility of engineering world disaster.Today, there are no more than two parties in the world—those who are on the sideof right human relations and those who are on the side of selfish and cruelpower politics. The totalitarian powers are on the march—ruthless, selfish,cruel and aggressive; the powers which are battling for human liberty and forthe rights of the defenceless little nations are standing with their backs tothe wall, facing the strongest display of human might that the world has everseen. The nations which are not yet physically involved are preparing for someform of action and for defence—defence against the dictator powers but notagainst the fighting democracies.The battle today is being fought out on the land, on the sea, and in the air.From the economic standpoint, every country is involved, and ruin stalks in thewake of war; the stopping of imports or of exports in many lands is bringingabout the financial ruin of thousands; the pressure of economic disaster, thefear of famine and pestilence and the constant risk of becoming actively a partof the war faces every country not yet actually in the fighting line. The fearof defeat, of death and injury, and of the loss of all possessions is added tothese problems, where the nations at war are concerned.Humanity must face up to these facts. No matter how people may evade the truth,no matter how they may escape into a dream world of wishful thinking, the factremains—inevitable and undeniable—that the world is at war and everyone isinvolved.The Goodwill WorkPrior to September, 1939, the objectives of our world-wide work, over a periodof nine years, were the spreading of world goodwill, the discovery of the menand women of goodwill throughout the world, and the endeavour to teach themeaning of the will-to-good. This is the main task of [178] the New Group ofWorld Servers. We inculcated a non-separative attitude and the need for righthuman relations. We endeavoured to make clear that differing forms of governmentand varying ideological systems were right and possible, provided that humanbeings lived together in goodwill and recognised their blood brotherhood.Then humanity made its decision to fight, and the war broke out: one group, theinstigators of the war, fighting to acquire material power, the glory of anation and the subjugation of the defenceless; and the other, fighting topreserve its own liberty of action, the preservation of its integrity, the rightof the little nations and the spiritual values. Immediately, the issue wasabundantly clear in the minds of those who were in touch with human affairs;immediately certain nations took sides against the forces of aggression;immediately, other nations, biased by similar distorted ideologies and equallyselfish purposes, stood with the aggressor nation; immediately, panic swept theremaining nations, who took refuge in short-sighted neutrality and defenceprogrammes—a neutrality and programmes which have proved quite futile to protectthem.Where, then, should the New Group of World Servers stand? What should the menand women of goodwill do? Should they side with the totalitarian powers becausein so doing they will bring the conflict more rapidly to an end, or should theystand on the side of the neutral powers, frantically pursuing ineffective peaceprogrammes, policies of appeasement, and play into the hands of the totalitarianpowers?Humanity having decided to fight out the battle physically , there was nothingleft to do but issue a challenge to the men and women of goodwill to take theirstand on the side of such action as would release humanity through thedestruction of the evil forces. These had determined to prove that might wasright. Therefore, the forces fighting for progress and civilisation had to meetforce with force.The challenge was taken up by the democracies who [179] stand for human rightsand liberty. Because of the decision to fight on the side of spiritual progress,the spiritual forces of the planet had no alternative but to align themselves onthe side of the allied democracies, and endeavour to awaken the neutral nationsto the issue. They ranged themselves against the leaders of the aggressornations, though not against their poor deluded or subdued peoples. They too mustbe liberated by the allied democracies.On the basis of an active will-to-good, the men and women of goodwill, actingunder the inspiration of the New Group of World Servers, had no alternative butto take their stand with the spiritual forces and join the struggle for theliberation of humanity from totalitarian ambitions and the intentions of a groupof evil men. But the spirit of goodwill must be, steadily and unchangingly, themotivating impulse. No hate must be allowed to enter in. The greatest good ofthe greatest number lies today in the release of the nations from the dominationof the totalitarian powers.The Pacifist PositionThe second point upon which I would touch is the arguments brought out by thepacifists of the world. All true and good people are pacifically minded and allhate war. This is a fact which the academic idealist and pacifist often forgets.Such people tell us that two wrongs do not make a right; and to meet murder withmurder (which is their definition of war) is sinful; that war is evil (which noone denies) and that one must not take part in it. They contend that thinkingthoughts of peace and of love can put the world straight and end the war. Suchpeople, fighting the existent fact of war, usually do little or nothing concreteto right the wrongs which are responsible for the war, and permit theirdefence—personal, municipal, national and international—to be undertaken byothers. The sincerity of these people cannot be questioned.It should be remembered, in countering these ideas and in justifying thefighting spirit of the Christian democracies, [180] that it is motive thatcounts. War can be and is mass murder, where the motive is wrong. It can besacrifice and right action, where the motive is right. The slaying of a man inthe act of killing the defenceless is not regarded as murder. The principleremains the same, whether it is killing an individual who is murdering, orfighting a nation which is warring on the defenceless. The material means, whichevil uses for selfish ends, can also be employed for good purposes. The death ofthe physical body is a lesser evil than the setting back of civilisation, thethwarting of the divine purposes of the human spirit, the negating of allspiritual teaching, and the control of men’s minds and liberties. War is alwaysevil, but it can be the lesser of two evils, as is the case today.The present war, if carried forward to a successful completion by the defeat ofthe totalitarian powers, constitutes a far lesser evil than the subjugation ofmany nations to the unparalleled cupidity, the appalling educational process andthe defiance of all recognised spiritual values by the Axis powers. If thetotalitarian powers should conquer, it would mean years of turmoil and revolt;their victory would result in untold misery.It is no doubt an undeniable spiritual truth that right thought can change andsave the world, but it is also true that there are not enough people able tothink to do this work. Also, there is not enough time in which to do it. Thethoughts of peace are mainly founded upon a stubborn idealism that loves theideal more than humanity. They are based also upon an unrecognised fear of warand upon an individual inertia which prefers the dream world of wishful thinkingto the shouldering of responsibility for the security of humanity.Thus briefly have I sought to make the position of the New Group of WorldServers clear as it fights for the rights of man, for the spiritual future ofhumanity, and for the new world order. What I have now to say will fall intofour parts: [181]I. The world as it exists today. The present situation is the result of pasttendencies, of underlying pressures and of human decisions.II. The new world order. This we will contrast with the old order and with theso-called “new order” of the totalitarian powers.III. Some problems involved. Four major world problems will call for discussionand these we must consider.IV. The task ahead. We will then deal with the interlude until peace is achievedplus some suggestions for the coming period of reconstruction.I. THE WORLD TODAYWhat are the causes which have produced present world conditions? What are theunderlying pressures which are producing the present chaos or those which canproduce eventual order? Before there can be correction, there must beappreciation of error; there must be understanding of the predisposing causesproducing the necessity; there must be realisation of the general guilt and ashared responsibility for the evil conditions; there must be determination tomake restitution, and to cease from evil doing.The tendency to fasten the war on Hitler and his gang of evil men should notblind us to the causes which have made his evil work possible. He is mainly aprecipitating agency, for through him world selfishness and cruelty have beenbrought to a focus. But, as Christ has said: “Woe unto the world because ofoffences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whomthe offence cometh.” (Matthew 18:7.) The causes of this rampant evil areinherent in humanity itself.Ancient and untrammelled selfishness has ever been a characteristic of man; thedesire for power and for possession has ever motivated men and nations; cruelty,lust, and sacrifice of the higher values to the lower have been deeply rootedhuman habits for ages. Of these ancient habits of thought and behaviour allpeoples and all nations are guilty. Steadily, [182] as the world grew closer,the lines of cleavage and the antagonism of the nations increased, and thus thepresent war (beginning in 1914) is the inevitable result of wrong thought,selfish goals and ancient hatreds. Individualistic interest, separative aims andaggressive desire march towards their inevitable finale—war and chaos.The economic situation also provides a symbol of this condition. The nationsdivide themselves into the “Haves” and the “Have Nots,” and thus bring in thepresent era of gangsterism. Organised gangs in the United States came into beingas an expression of these tendencies in national life. In the internationalworld, three nations are now playing the same part. The allied nations and theUnited States are recognising the menace of national and internationalgangsterism and are endeavouring to crush it. But—and this is the point ofimportance—these conditions have been made possible by humanity as a whole.Materialism and SpiritualityThere are today three major human trends: First of all, a trend towards aspiritual and free way of life; secondly, a trend towards intellectualunfoldment; and lastly, a potent trend towards material living and aggression.At present, the last of these innate tendencies is in the saddle, with thesecond, the intellectual attitude, throwing its weight upon the side of thematerial goals. A relatively small group is throwing the weight of humanaspiration upon the side of the spiritual values. The war between the pairs ofopposites—materialism and spirituality—is raging fiercely. Only as men turn awayfrom material aggression and towards spiritual objectives will the worldsituation change, and men—motivated by goodwill—force the aggressors back totheir own place and release humanity from fear and force. We are today reapingthe results of our own sowing. The recognition of the cause of the problemprovides humanity with the opportunity to end it. The time has arrived in whichit is possible to institute those changes [183] in attitude which will bring anera of peace and goodwill, founded on right human relations.These two forces—materialism and spirituality—face each other. What will be theoutcome? Will men arrest the evil and initiate a period of understanding,cooperation and right relationship, or will they continue the process of selfishplanning and of economic and militant competition? This question must beanswered by the clear thinking of the masses and by the calm and unafraidchallenges of the democracies.On all sides the need for a new world order is being recognised. Thetotalitarian powers are talking of the “new order in Europe”; the idealists andthinkers are unfolding schemes and plans which vision entirely new conditionsthat will bring the old bad order to an end. There is a constant demand for theAllies to state their peace aims and indicate clearly what adjustments will bemade after the war, because a vision of the future world policy will helphumanity through the present crisis.Historical BackgroundThroughout the Middle Ages, the rule of powerful monarchs, the spread of empiresand the march of national conquerors were outstanding characteristics. Arelatively small number of people were involved. The Church of the time hadimmense power in all European countries; it controlled the education of thepeople, but laid no foundation for right political thought. The history of thepast is the history of many forms of government. Races and nations have come andgone. Political regimes and religious forms have played their part, havepersisted or disappeared. The sorry history of humanity has been one of kingsand potentates, rulers and warriors, presidents and dictators—rising into powerat the expense of their own or other nations. Conquerors come and go—Akbar,Genghis Khan, the Pharaohs, Alexander the Great, Caesar, Charlemagne, Williamthe Conqueror, Napoleon, Hitler and Mussolini. These have all upset the rhythm[184] of their times and have come to power through aggression and slaughter. Asthe nations grew more closely interrelated, their influence and their field ofexpression increased. The growing means of communication brought this about;Great Britain knew nothing of the movements of Alexander; the peoples of Americaknew naught about Genghis Khan; but the sound of the marching armies of Napoleonwas heard over a far wider area, and the triumphs of Hitler—diplomatic andmilitary—are known throughout the world.The totalitarian powers have turned the world into one armed camp—for offence ordefence. Motivating all these conquerors was lust for gold, lust for land, lustfor power, lust for personal triumph. The modern dictators are no exception.They bring nothing new.World AnarchyThe history of the world has been built around the theme of war; its points ofcrisis have been the great battles. The thought of revenge motivates somenations; the demand for the righting of ancient historical wrongs influencesothers; the restitution of lands, earlier held, directs the acts of others. Forinstance: the ancient glory of the Roman Empire must be restored—at the expenseof the helpless little peoples; the culture of France must be paramount andFrench security must outweigh all other considerations; British imperialism hasin the past outraged other nations; German hegemony and “living space” mustdominate Europe, and the German superman must be the arbiter of human life;American isolationism would leave humanity defenceless in its hour of need andhand men over to the rule of Hitler; Russia, in her silence, cannot be trusted;Japan is upsetting the balance of power in Asia. Such is the picture today.Anarchy rules the world; famine stalks the inhabitants of Europe; the civilianpopulation of cities, the women and children, are in grave danger of injury anddeath and are forced to live underground; pestilence appears; there is no safetyon land or sea or in the air; the [185] nations are on the verge of financialruin; science has turned to the invention of the instruments of death; thepopulations of cities and entire districts are shifted from one part of acountry to another; families and homes are broken up; there is intense fear,hopeless looking into the future, bewildered questioning, suicide and murder;the smoke of countless fires blackens the skies; the seas are strewn with deadand with wrecked vessels; the thunder of guns and the noise of exploding bombsare heard in approximately twenty countries; war rises up from the waters,marches over the lands and descends from the skies.It is to this situation that the old order has brought humanity. It is to thisdisaster that man’s cruelty and selfishness have tended; no nations are exemptfrom this criticism, and all are more rapidly moved by selfish purpose than bythe spirit of sacrifice.Even idealistic America can only be aroused into action by an appeal to herself-interest and security.For our encouragement let us recognise that the same humanity which has broughtabout these terrible conditions can also create the new world, the new order andthe new way of life. The selfish, wicked past can give way to a future ofunderstanding, of cooperation, of right human relations and of good.Separativeness must be superseded by unity. The combination of totalitarianaggressors, of allied democracies and of anxious neutral nations must be changedinto a world which is characterised by one endeavour—the establishing of thoserelations which will produce the happiness and peace of the whole, and not onlyof the part.II. THE NEW WORLD ORDERI assume that my readers recognise some intelligent or spiritual direction ofhumanity. I care not by what name they call that guiding Purpose. Some may callit the Will of God; others, the inevitable trends of the evolutionary process;still others may believe in the spiritual forces of the planet; others mayregard it as the spiritual Hierarchy of the [186] planet, or the great WhiteLodge; many millions speak of the guidance of Christ and His disciples. Be thatas it may, there is a universal recognition of a guiding Power, exertingpressure throughout the ages, which appears to be leading all towards anultimate good.Some definite direction has led man from the stage of primeval man to thatevolutionary point where a Plato, a Shakespeare, a da Vinci, a Beethoven canappear. Some power has evoked man’s capacity to formulate ideas, to producesystems of theology, of science and of government; some inner motivating powerhas given man the ability to create beauty, to discover the secrets of nature;some realisation of divine responsibility lies behind the philanthropy, theeducational systems, and the welfare movements throughout the world. Theprogress of the human spirit has been one of irresistible unfoldment, of adeveloping appreciation of reality, beauty and wisdom. Instinct has developedinto intellect; intellect is beginning to unfold into intuition. Thesignificance of God, the registering of man’s divine potentialities, and theincreasing capacity to understand and to share in the thought processes ofothers—all these indicate progress and unfoldment.This picture of the beauty of the human spirit must be placed beside the earlierpicture of man’s selfishness and cruelty, of man’s inhumanity to man. Bothpictures are true, but only the one of beauty is eternal; the other is buttransient. Man is a composite of higher and lower expressions, and behind allthe wars and difficulties which accompany man’s progress through the ages liesthis major factor—an ancient persistent fight between man’s spiritual aspirationand his material desires. This condition is today brought to a focus in theconflict raging between the totalitarian powers and the nations which arefighting for the rights of the human spirit and for the freedom of humanity.My use of the word spiritual has nothing to do with the use of this word as theorthodox religions use it, except in so far as the religious expression is apart of the general spirituality of mankind. Everything is spiritual which tends[187] towards understanding, towards kindness, towards that which is productiveof beauty and which can lead man on to a fuller expression of his divinepotentialities. All is evil which drives man deeper into materialism, whichomits the higher values of living, which endorses selfishness, which sets upbarriers to the establishing of right human relations, and which feeds thespirit of separateness, of fear, of revenge.On the basis of these distinctions, it is surely apparent that God is on theside of the allied nations, for it cannot be supposed that Christ is on the sideof Hitler and the rule of cruel aggression. The spiritual Hierarchy of theplanet is throwing the weight of its strength against the Axis powers just in sofar as the spiritually minded peoples of the world can collaborate, for therecan be no coercion of man’s free will. No one is afraid of the allied nations;the situation has not been precipitated by the Allies; their methods are not themethods of lying propaganda and the terrorising of the weak and the defenceless.Facts prove these points, and it is this recognition which lies behind theconstant aid of the United States. The way of living and the spiritual objectsof the democracies are recognised by all, and it is these which are threatenedby the totalitarian concepts of life. Through the democracies humanity speaks.The Axis World OrderThe totalitarian order must go because it is contrary to the spiritual vision.The world order, as visioned by Hitler, is based upon the subjection of the weakto the rule of a super-Germany; it is one in which the life of the littlenations will be allowed to go on just in so far as they serve the need ofGermany. The lesser Axis powers are permitted existence only because theybenefit German aims—Italy, to give Germany scope in the Mediterranean; Japan, tohandle the Asiatic problem which is too large for Germany to handle alone. It isan order whose intention is that the best of all industrial and agriculturalproducts shall go to Germany and the unwanted residue to the little nations. Itis an order [188] in which the educational processes will be controlled by thedominant super-race. All departments of knowledge will be subordinated to theglorification of Germany. Germany will be portrayed as the seed of all worldglory, and as the ruthless saviour of mankind; the beauties of war, of struggleand of physical strength will be emphasised, and these so-called admirableobjectives of the human spirit will be developed to produce a race of men inwhom the “effeminate” beauties of loving kindness and wise consideration forothers will find no place.I would call your attention to the teaching now being given to the German youth.Might is right. The German belongs to the super-race, and all other races areinferior. Only a chosen aristocracy should be permitted the privilege ofeducation and of rule. The masses of the people are no more than cattle andexist only to be slaves of the superior race. War is to men what childbirth isto women. War is a natural process and therefore eternally right. All sources ofsupply must be controlled by Germany, and consequently even those nations atpresent neutral must be brought under the German sphere of influence. Thetotalitarian powers will dominate the economic system of the world and controlall imports and exports. The standard of living in both hemispheres will belowered; everything will be related to the good of Germany, and no other nationwill be considered. Christian teaching and Christian ethics must necessarily beeliminated, because Germany regards Christianity and its divine Founder aseffeminate and weak, as emphasising the softer qualities of human nature, and asresponsible for the decadence of all nations, except Germany. Christianity mustalso be overthrown because it is based on Jewish sources; the rule of Christmust come to an end, because only the rule of force is right.In the world order of the Axis powers, the individual has no rights; he has nofreedom except in so far as he serves the state; there will be no liberty ofthought or conscience, all issues will be decided by the state, and the privatecitizen [189] will have no right to an opinion. Men will be drafted like slavesinto the service of the state.Such is the picture of the order which the Axis powers are preparing to imposeupon the world, and to this their own words testify. Only insight into the truenature of this crisis, a determination to face the facts, and fearlessness willsuffice to defeat Hitler. This conquering fearlessness must be based on arecognition of the spiritual values involved, on a belief in God, and on acommonsense which is determined to establish security, right human relations andliberty.It is important that people face up to the facts immediately. They must realisewhat is the nature of the world order which Hitler is preparing to enforce, andwhat lies ahead of humanity if the Axis powers triumph. It is essential that thelittle children of the world be rescued from this overshadowing evil and fromthe false education to which they will be subjected if the totalitarian powershold Europe in their grasp. The intensive culture given to the youth of Germanyduring the past twenty years has proved the effects of environing mentalattitudes. These boys who roll their tanks and fly their planes over thecountries of Europe and who wage war on women and children are the product of aneducational system, and are therefore the victims of an evil process. Thechildren of Germany must be rescued from the future which Hitler plans, as wellas the children of other countries; the women of Germany must be set free fromfear, as must the women in other lands; the population of Germany must also beliberated from the evil rule of Hitler. This is recognised by the alliednations. Make no mistake. The German is as dear to the heart of humanity, toGod, to Christ and to all right thinking people as are any other people. TheGerman must be rescued from Hitler’s world order as much as the Pole, the Jew,the Czech or any captive nation. In effecting this freedom, the allied nationsand the neutral powers must preserve the spirit of goodwill, even when usingforce, which is the only means of conquest the totalitarian powers understand.[190]Steps Towards the New World OrderIn contradistinction to the totalitarian world order, what should the rest ofthe world plan? Towards what world objectives should the democracies work?Utopian schemes, idealistic forms of government and cultural living processeshave ever been the playthings of the human mind, down through the centuries. Butthese Utopias have been so far ahead of possibility that their presentationseems useless. They are most of them wholly impractical.Certain immediate possibilities and attainable objectives can, however, beworked out, given a definite will-to-good and patience on the part of humanity.Certain major and spiritual premises should lie back of all efforts to formulatethe new world order. Let me state some of them:1. The new world order must meet the immediate need and not be an attempt tosatisfy some distant, idealistic vision.2. The new world order must be appropriate to a world which has passed through adestructive crisis and to a humanity which is badly shattered by the experience.3. The new world order must lay the foundation for a future world order whichwill be possible only after a time of recovery, of reconstruction, and ofrebuilding.4. The new world order will be founded on the recognition that all men are equalin origin and goal but that all are at differing stages of evolutionarydevelopment; that personal integrity, intelligence, vision and experience, plusa marked goodwill, should indicate leadership. The domination of the proletariatover the aristocracy and bourgeoisie, as in Russia, or the domination of anentrenched aristocracy over the proletariat and middle classes, as has beenuntil lately the case in Great Britain, must disappear. The control of labour bycapital or the control of capital by labour must also go. [191]5. In the new world order, the governing body in any nation should be composedof those who work for the greatest good of the greatest number and who at thesame time offer opportunity to all, seeing to it that the individual is leftfree. Today the men of vision are achieving recognition, thus making possible aright choice of leaders. It was not possible until this century.6. The new world order will be founded on an active sense of responsibility. Therule will be “all for one and one for all.” This attitude among nations willhave to be developed. It is not yet present.7. The new world order will not impose a uniform type of government, a syntheticreligion and a system of standardisation upon the nations. The sovereign rightsof each nation will be recognised and its peculiar genius, individual trends andracial qualities will be permitted full expression. In one particular onlyshould there be an attempt to produce unity, and that will be in the field ofeducation.8. The new world order will recognise that the produce of the world, the naturalresources of the planet and its riches, belong to no one nation but should beshared by all. There will be no nations under the category “haves” and othersunder the opposite category. A fair and properly organised distribution of thewheat, the oil and the mineral wealth of the world will be developed, based uponthe needs of each nation, upon its own internal resources and the requirementsof its people. All this will be worked out in relation to the whole.9. In the preparatory period for the new world order there will be a steady andregulated disarmament. It will not be optional. No nation will be permitted toproduce and organise any equipment for destructive purposes or to infringe thesecurity of any other nation. One of the first tasks of any future peaceconference will be to regulate this matter and gradually see to the disarming ofthe nations.[192] These are the simple and general premises upon which the new world ordermust begin its work. These preliminary stages must be kept fluid andexperimental; the vision of possibility must never be lost, and the foundationsmust be preserved inviolate, but the intermediate processes and theexperimentations must be carried forward by men who, having the best interestsof the whole at heart, can change the detail of organisation whilst preservingthe life of the organism.Right Human RelationsThe objective of their work can be summed up thus: the new world order willfacilitate the establishing of right human relations, based on justice, on therecognition of inherited rights, on opportunity for all—irrespective of race,colour or creed—on the suppression of crime and selfishness through righteducation, and on the recognition of divine potentialities in man as well as therecognition of a divine directing Intelligence in Whom man lives, and moves andhas his being.The difficulties confronting the nations when the war is over may seeminsuperable but—given vision, goodwill and patience—they can be solved. Assumingthat humanity will not rest until the aggressor nations are subdued, it will benecessary for the conquering democracies to be generous, merciful, understandingand attentive to the voice of the people as a whole. It is that voice (usuallysound in its pronouncements) which must be evoked, recognised and listened to,and not the voices of the separative exponents of any ideology, of any form ofgovernment, religion or party. The objective of those who are entrusted with thestraightening out of the world is not the imposition of democracy upon theentire world or to force Christianity upon a world of diversified religions. Itis surely to foster the best elements in any national government to which thepeople may subscribe, or which they intelligently endorse. Each nation shouldrecognise that its form of government may be suited [193] to it and quiteunsuited to another nation; it should be taught that the function of each nationis the perfecting of its national life, rhythm and machinery, so that it can bean efficient co-partner with all other nations.It is equally essential that the new world order should develop in humanity asense of divinity and of relationship to God, yet with no emphasis upon racialtheologies and separative creeds. The essentials of religious and politicalbeliefs must be taught and a new simplicity of life inculcated. Today, these arelost in the emphasis laid upon material possession, upon things and upon money.The problem of money will have to be faced; the problem of the distribution ofwealth—whether natural or human—will need careful handling and a compromisereached between those nations which possess unlimited resources and those whohave few or none; the problem of the varying forms of national government mustbe faced with courage and insight; the restoration—psychological, spiritual andphysical—of mankind must constitute a primary responsibility. The sense ofsecurity must be put on a firm basis—the basis of right relationship, and notthe basis of force. Men must feel secure because they are seeking to developinternational goodwill and can trust each other, and are not therefore dependentupon the strength of their armies and fleets.The recognition of a spiritual Hierarchy which is working through the New Groupof World Servers must steadily grow in some form or another. This will happenwhen the world statesmen and the rulers of the different nations and governingbodies—political and religious—are men of vision, spiritually motivated andselflessly inspired.The future world order will be the effective expression of a fusion of the innerspiritual way of life and the outer civilised and cultural way of acting; thisis a definite possibility because humanity, in its upper brackets, has alreadydeveloped the power to live in the intellectual and physical worldssimultaneously. Many today are living in the spiritual world also. Tomorrowthere will be many more. [194]III. SOME PROBLEMS INVOLVEDThe new world order will be confronted with many problems. These problems willnot be solved by the imposition of a solution by means of force, as in the Axisworld order. They will be solved by right educational processes and byunderstanding the objectives of the true world order. They fall roughly intofour categories: the racial problem, the economic problem, the problem ofgovernment, and the religious problem.The Racial ProblemThere is no way of solving the racial problem by legislation, segregation, or bythe effort to produce national blocs, as in the case in Germany today when sheproclaims Germany as the super-race. Such efforts will only produce insuperablebarriers. With very few exceptions, there are no pure races. Germany inparticular, by its place at the crossroads of Europe, is definitely the fusionof many strains. Tides of emigration, marching armies throughout the centuries,and modern travel have inextricably mixed and fused all the races. It maytherefore be assumed that any attempt to isolate a race or to enforce so-called“racial purity” is foredoomed to failure. The only solution of this problem isthe basic recognition that all men are brothers; that one blood pours throughhuman veins; that we are all the children of the one Father and that our failureto recognise this fact is simply an indication of man’s stupidity. Historicalbackgrounds, climatic conditions and widespread inter-marriage have made thedifferent races what they are today. Essentially, however, humanity is one—theheir of the ages, the product of many fusions, conditioned by circumstances andenriched by the processes of evolutionary development. This basic unity must nowbe recognised.The major racial problem has, for many centuries, been the Jewish, which hasbeen brought to a critical point by Germany. This problem is also capable ofsolution if properly recognised for what it is, and if coupled with an effort by[195] the Jews themselves to solve it, and to be cooperative in the worldefforts to adjust their problem. This they have not yet done because the averageJew is lonely and unsettled, able to do little to put himself right before theworld. Instinctively and intellectually, the Jew is separative; intuitively hehas vision, but at the same time he possesses no sense of fusion with otherpeoples.There is no scientific and hitherto unknown mode of solving racial problems. Itis finally a question of right thinking, decent behaviour, and simple kindness.The question will not be solved by inter-marriage, or by isolating groups foroccupation of special areas, or by any man-made ideas of superiority orinferiority. Right human relations will come by a mutual recognition ofmistakes, by sorrow for wrong action in the past, and by restitution, ifpossible. It will come when nations can be educated to appreciate the goodqualities of other nations and to comprehend the part they play in the wholepicture. It will be developed when the sense of racial superiority is killed;when racial differences and racial quarrels are relegated to the unholy past andonly a future of cooperation and of understanding is actively developed; it willmake its presence felt when the living standards of right relation (sought bythe enlightened people of every race) become the habitual attitude of the massesand when it is regarded as contrary to the best interests of any nation tospread those ideas which tend to erect racial or national barriers, arousehatreds or foster differences and separation. Such a time will surely come.Humanity will master the problem of right human relations and attitudes.It is inevitable that racial differences, national quarrels and castedistinction exist, but it is equally imperative that they disappear. The worldis one world. Humanity is one unit in the evolutionary process. Differences areman-made and engender hatreds and separation. When the children of the variousraces are taught from their earliest years that there are no differences, thatall men are brothers, and that the apparent distinctions are essentiallysuperficial, then [196] future generations will approach the problem of worldinterrelations unhandicapped by prejudice, by pride of race, or by instilledhistorical resentments. By right education little children can be taught rightattitudes and will respond, for a child sees and recognises no differences, andthe truth of the Biblical promise that “a little child shall lead them” will beproven scientifically true. In the new world order this educational process willbe started.The Economic ProblemThis problem is basically far less difficult of solution. Sound commonsense cansolve it. There are adequate resources for the sustenance of human life, andthese science can increase and develop. The mineral wealth of the world, theoil, the produce of the fields, the contribution of the animal kingdom, theriches of the sea, and the fruits and the flowers are all offering themselves tohumanity. Man is the controller of it all, and they belong to everyone and arethe property of no one group, nation or race. It is solely due to man’sselfishness that (in these days of rapid transportation) thousands are starvingwhilst food is rotting or destroyed; it is solely due to the grasping schemesand the financial injustices of man’s making that the resources of the planetare not universally available under some wise system of distribution. There isno justifiable excuse for the lack of the essentials of life in any part of theworld. Such a state of lack argues short-sighted policy and the blocking of thefree circulation of necessities for some reason or other. All these deplorableconditions are based on some national or group selfishness and on the failure towork out some wise impartial scheme for the supplying of human need throughoutthe world.What then must be done, apart from the education of the coming generations inthe need for sharing , for a free circulation of all the essential commodities?The cause of this evil way of living is very simple. It is a product of pastwrong educational methods, of competition and the facility with which thehelpless and weak can be exploited. [197] No one group is responsible as certainfanatical ideologists might lead the ignorant to suppose. Our period is simplyone in which human selfishness has come to its climax and must either destroyhumanity or be brought intelligently to an end.Three things will end this condition of great luxury and extreme poverty, ofgross over-feeding of the few and the starvation of the many, plus thecentralisation of the world’s produce under the control of a handful of peoplein each country. These are: first, the recognition that there is enough food,fuel, oil and minerals in the world to meet the need of the entire population.The problem, therefore, is basically one of distribution. Secondly, this premiseof adequate supply handled through right distribution must be accepted, and thesupplies which are essential to the health, security and happiness of mankindmust be made available. Third, that the entire economic problem and theinstitution of the needed rules and distributing agencies should be handled byan economic league of nations. In this league, all the nations will have theirplace; they will know their national requirements (based on population andinternal resources, etc.) and will know also what they can contribute to thefamily of nations; all will be animated by the will to the general good—awill-to-good that will probably at first be based on expediency and nationalneed but which will be constructive in its working out.Certain facts are obvious. The old order has failed. The resources of the worldhave fallen into the hands of the selfish, and there has been no justdistribution. Some nations have had too much, and have exploited their surplus;other nations have had too little, and their national life and their financialsituation have been crippled thereby. At the close of this war all the nationswill be in financial difficulties. All nations will require re-building; allwill have to attend actively to the settlement of the future economic life ofthe planet and its adjustment upon sounder lines.This period of adjustment offers the opportunity to effect drastic and deeplyneeded changes and the establishing [198] of a new economic order, based on thecontribution of each nation to the whole, the sharing of the fundamentalnecessities of life and the wise pooling of all resources for the benefit ofeverybody, plus a wise system of distribution. Such a plan is feasible.The solution here offered is so simple that, for that very reason, it may failto make an appeal. The quality required by those engineering this change ofeconomic focus is so simple also—the will-to-good—that again it may beover-looked, but without simplicity and goodwill little can be effected afterthe world war. The great need will be for men of vision, of wide sympathy,technical knowledge and cosmopolitan interest. They must possess also theconfidence of the people. They must meet together and lay down the rules wherebythe world can be adequately fed; they must determine the nature and extent ofthe contribution which any one nation must make; they must settle the nature andextent of the supplies which should be given to any nation, and so bring aboutthose conditions which will keep the resources of the world circulating justlyand engineer those preventive measures which will offset human selfishness andgreed.Can such a group of men be found? I believe it can. Everywhere there are deepstudents of human nature, scientific investigators with wide human sympathies,and conscientious men and women who have for long—under the old and cruelsystem—wrestled with the problem of human pain and need.The new era of simplicity must come in. The new world order will inaugurate thissimpler life based on adequate food, right thought, creative activity andhappiness. These essentials are only possible under a right economic rule. Thissimplification and this wise distribution of the world’s resources must embracethe high and the low, the rich and the poor, thus serving all men alike.The Problem Of GovernmentComing now to the realm of government, under the new world order, one is facedwith a very complex situation. [199] Certain great ideological regimes havedivided the world into opposing groups. There are the great democracies, underwhich certain of the few remaining monarchies find a place; there are thetotalitarian powers in which the ancient dictatorships and autocracies of thepast are summed up. There is nothing new in the Axis policies. They areessentially reactionary groups, for tyrants, cruelty and the exploitation of theweak are part of ancient history. The democracies, with all their presentineffectiveness, have in them the germ of that which is truly new, for they arethe expression of an upward surging towards self-rule and self-mastery byhumanity as a whole. There is also the communistic ideal which is a curiousblend of individualism, dictatorship, the ancient conflict between labour andcapital, the Sermon on the Mount, and the worst aspects of revolution andexploitation. The lines which it will follow, even in the immediate future, areunpredictable. There are other countries and peoples whose governments areconditioned by their environment and who at present play no real determiningpart in world events, except in so far as a greater power uses them. Again,there are peoples and tribes who still pursue their little lives, unaffected bythe turmoil to be found in the more highly civilised parts of the world.Behind all this diversity of governmental methods, certain clear outlines areemerging which indicate wider fusions and a tendency to bring about certainsyntheses. Various basic trends of thought are appearing which, in the new worldorder, will unfold into that major synthesis so much desired by the spiritualHierarchy of the planet, and which, whilst preserving the large national andracial outlines, will produce an underlying and subjective state of mind whichwill end the age of separateness. Desire is today being evoked for the FederatedStates of Europe, modelled on the lines of the British Commonwealth of Nationsor the United States of America; there is talk of a new order in Asia, of theGood Neighbour policy in America, of a Federal Union of the democratic nations;there is also the steady spread of the Soviet Socialist Republics. Certain majorgroupings [200] would seem possible and probably advisable. They might bedivided as follows:1. A Federal Union of the great democracies after the war. This might includethe British Empire as a whole, the United States, the Scandinavian countries andcertain northern European nations, including Germany.2. A Union of the Latin countries, including France, Spain, all theMediterranean countries, the Balkan countries (except one or two which might beabsorbed into the U.S.S.R.), and South America.3. The United Soviet Socialist Republics and certain Asiatic nations working incollaboration with them, such as China, and later Japan.These three great blocs would not be antagonistic blocs but simply geographicalspheres of influence. They would all three work in the closest unity andeconomic relation. Each nation within the three blocs would preserve itssovereign independence, but between these independent nations and between theseblocs there would be identity of purpose, unity of effort and the recognition ofthe economic control of a league of nations. This league, being formed of therepresentatives of all the nations and its inner governing body being chosen bythe three blocs, would control all sources of supply, distribute all suchsupplies and determine all economic policies.With the details of these future adjustments I shall not deal. They must bewrought out by the men and women of goodwill in the crucible of experiment andexperience. Only universal disaster could have brought men to a state of mindwherein such propositions and solutions could be presented. The generalrecognition that the old order has lamentably failed is most valuable.The Religious ProblemWhen we come to consider religion in the new world order, we are faced with afar more complicated problem [201] and yet, at the same time, with a far easierone. The reason for this is that the subject of religion is one which is studiedand somewhat understood by the majority of men. On theological interpretationsthere are wide differences; on a widespread recognition of a universal divineIntelligence or of God (by whatever name the all-embracing Life may be called)there is a general similarity of reaction. Forms of religion are so different,and the theological adherents are so fierce in their loyalties andpartisanships, that the emergence of a world religion is necessarily of profounddifficulty. But that emergence is very close at hand and the differences arerelatively superficial. The new world religion is nearer than many think, andthis is due to two things: first, the theological quarrels are mainly overnon-essentials, and secondly, the younger generation is basically spiritual butquite uninterested in theology.The intelligent youth of all countries are rapidly repudiating orthodoxtheology, state ecclesiasticism and the control of the church. They are neitherinterested in man-made interpretations of truth nor in past quarrels between themajor world religions. At the same time, they are profoundly interested in thespiritual values and are earnestly seeking verification of their deep-seatedunvoiced recognitions. They look to no bible or system of so-called inspiredspiritual knowledge and revelation, but their eyes are on the undefined largerwholes in which they seek to merge and lose themselves, such as the state, anideology, or humanity itself. In this expression of the spirit ofself-abnegation may be seen the appearance of the deepest truth of all religionand the justification of the Christian message. Christ, in His high place, caresnot whether men accept the theological interpretations of scholars andchurchmen, but He does care whether the keynote of His life of sacrifice andservice is reproduced among men; it is immaterial to Him whether the emphasislaid upon the detail and the veracity of the Gospel story is recognised andaccepted, for He is more interested that the search for truth and for subjectivespiritual experience should persist; He knows that within [202] each human heartis found that which responds instinctively to God, and that the hope of ultimateglory lies hid in the Christ-consciousness.Therefore, in the new world order, spirituality will supersede theology; livingexperience will take the place of theological acceptances. The spiritualrealities will emerge with increasing clarity and the form aspect will recedeinto the background; dynamic, expressive truth will be the keynote of the newworld religion. The living Christ will assume His rightful place in humanconsciousness and see the fruition of His plans, sacrifice and service, but thehold of the ecclesiastical orders will weaken and disappear. Only those willremain as guides and leaders of the human spirit who speak from livingexperience, and who know no creedal barriers; they will recognise the onwardmarch of revelation and the new emerging truths. These truths will be founded onthe ancient realities but will be adapted to modern need and will manifestprogressively the revelation of the divine nature and quality. God is now knownas Intelligence and Love. That the past has given us. He must be known as Willand Purpose, and that the future will reveal.When the racial problem has disappeared through the recognition of the one Life,when the economic problem has been solved by the nations working cooperativelytogether, when the problem of right government within each nation has beendetermined by the free will of their respective peoples, and the spirit of truereligion is unobstructed by ancient forms and interpretations, then we shall seea world in process of right experience, right human relations and a spiritualmoving forward to reality.A study of these four lines of human living will show how truly Germany is todaythe focal point of the world situation. In that unhappy nation, the racialproblem has attained such importance that the entire world is affected. From theeconomic angle, Hitler has said that Germany has been forced to fight in orderto preserve the life, economically speaking, of her people; factually, theeconomic life of Germany was not as critically threatened as that of many [203]smaller nations. The problem of government has also been brought to a criticalpoint by German activity and conquest and by the emphasis laid by the Axispowers upon the relation of the state to the individual. The attitude of theGerman rulers to religion is recognised as one of pronounced antagonism. Thusthe four major world problems are today being precipitated by Germany into thearena of action; they are evoking enquiry everywhere; the attention of men inevery land is now focussed on these problems, and solution is inevitable whenthe war is over. When these problems are rightly approached by the men and womenof goodwill, then we shall see a “world planning” for the production ofharmonious living such as never before has been possible.It is for humanity to solve its serious problems on the basis of brotherhood,and so bring in a way of living which will provide adequate supply of thenecessities of life through the proper organising of time, labour and goods.This will lead to an interplay between the citizen and the state which willevoke the service of the individual and the right protection of the state.Humanity will then be free for the experiment of spiritual living, and this willexpress itself through awakened human lives. Can more be asked for or expectedthan this? Such a way of life can be made possible if the men and women ofgoodwill, of intelligence and of idealism can begin the task of inaugurating thenew world order.IV. THE TASK AHEADThis brings us now to the practical aspects of the subject and to the answeringof the following question: Given the possibility of the new world order, whatcan be done to bring it into being at this time, in the midst of the conflict?The period into which we are now entering divides itself into two parts:1. The present period of the war itself, until the defeat of Germany and the endof the actual fighting. [204]2. The period after the guns have ceased roaring. The needed peace,reconstruction and rebuilding will then have to be determined.It is with these periods that we must concern ourselves. They are, and will be,times of great difficulty and of painful conflict and adjustment. The task ofrestoring the world to harmony and order is a stupendous one. The educating ofpeople everywhere in the necessity for new ideals of right living, for the newrhythms and the new “sharing” will not be easy. The work of healing the woundsof humanity, of rebuilding the shattered civilisation, of institutingdisarmament, of recognising national, material and psychological needs, and ofrescuing and restoring the happiness of the little children of the world andplanning their future security will take the best that is in the men and womenof goodwill; it will call for the wise guidance of the New Group of WorldServers and will engage the attention of intelligent people and understandingminds in every nation.The first preliminary is for the men and women of goodwill to decide once andfor all with which of the two forces, battling together, they will take theirstand, mentally and spiritually, even if they are not called upon by theircountry to do so physically. I write at this time for those who take their standon the side of the constructive forces which are fighting for the democraticvalues and the freedom of the peoples. I would here remind you that among thepeople in Germany and Italy there are thousands who also silently take theirstand with those struggling for victory over the Axis powers. This must never beforgotten, for such people exist in their multitudes under totalitarian rule.The Forces of Light are found in every land but are at present only able toexpress themselves effectively in the countries ranged against Germany.The men and women of goodwill, associated with the New Group of World Servers,should seek intelligently to understand the current problem, and to study theworld situation from all possible angles. Intelligent understanding, [205] loveof one’s fellowmen and sound commonsense are prerequisites of all demandedservice. Men should cultivate these qualities, divorcing them from allsentimental emotion and dealing factually with circumstance and environingconditions. It must be realised that the task to be done will take time, and themen and women of goodwill must brace themselves for sustained effort, foropposition, and for that dead lethargy and sick inertia which afflicts themasses of the people in every land. The immediate activities are two in number:1. The finding of those people in every country who react to the vision of thenew world order and who are the men and women of goodwill.2. The presentation of the future possibilities, by them, to the masses ofpeople in all lands.I would here remind you that members of the New Group of World Servers and menand women of goodwill must be sought for in every department of life. They willbe found among the adherents of all the current ideologies and in political andscientific circles, among the world educators and philanthropists, among thecreative workers, the industrialists, in ordinary homes and in the ranks oflabour.The New Group of World ServersThe New Group of World Servers is not a new organisation which is forming in theworld. It is simply a loose linking together of all men of constructive peaceaims and goodwill who lay the emphasis upon the prior need of establishing righthuman relations before any lasting peace is possible. This group in no wayinterferes with the allegiance and loyalties of any man. It is a bandingtogether of all who seek to express the spirit of Christ and who are free fromthe spirit of hatred and revenge. The challenge of this group to the world is todrop all antagonisms and antipathies, all hatred and racial differences, andattempt to live in terms of the one family, the one life, and the one humanity.[206] The New Group of World Servers believes that (through the agency ofgoodwill) the new world order can be firmly established on Earth. Today, in theinterim period of the war, preparation for reconstruction can go forwardsimultaneously with the effort to defeat the totalitarian powers.The men and women of goodwill must not be energised into activity with the noteof sacrifice. The war has exacted much of that from them. The clarion note ofjoy through goodwill activity must be sent out. Let the beauty of what can be,the glory of the vision and the spiritual, scientific and physical rebuilding ofhumanity be held before them, inspiring them to renewed effort.Through the work earlier done all over the world by the men of vision and ofgoodwill, there exist today many thousands of people in Europe, America andelsewhere who are waiting for the guidance which will start them into rightactivity. In every land the men and women of goodwill are to be found, ready torespond to a clear call and intelligent organisation in the service ofreconstruction. Let them be found.The message to be taught prior to any future peace consists of the followingthree clear and practical truths:1. That the errors and mistakes of past centuries, culminating in the presentworld war, are the joint errors and mistakes of humanity as a whole. Thisrecognition will lead to the establishing of the principle of sharing, so neededin the world today.2. That there are no problems and conditions which cannot be solved by thewill-to-good. Goodwill nourishes the spirit of understanding and fosters themanifestation of the principle of cooperation . This cooperative spirit is thesecret of all right human relations and the enemy of competition.3. That there is a blood relationship between men which, when recognised,dissolves all barriers and ends the spirit of separativeness and hate. The peaceand happiness of each is the concern, therefore, of all. [207] This develops theprinciple of responsibility and lays the foundation of right corporate action.These are the basic beliefs of the men and women of goodwill and provide theincentive to all service and action. These three practical and scientific truthsembody the three basic facts and the initial acceptance of all world servers.They are contrary to no world position, subversive of no government or religiousattitude and are innate in the consciousness of all men, evoking immediateresponse. Their acceptance will “heal” international sores.I call on all the men and women of goodwill in the world to study the principlesof the new world order. I call upon them, as they fight for justice and therights of the little nations and the future of the children of all nations, tobegin to educate those whom they can reach, in right attitudes and in thatforesighted vision which will make the mistakes of the past impossible in thefuture.One basic divine attribute is not yet as strong as it should be in humanity—theattribute of forgiveness. It is still associated with magnanimity. It is notseen to be essentially a condition of future relation between all nations, basedupon a recognition of our common humanity. Germany, under her misguided and evilrulers, needs forgiveness. All the great Powers have also sinned in some degreeand all have grievously erred in the past. Germany has precipitated the evilwhich has come upon the world, but she has within herself the seeds of her ownpunishment; these seeds will not come to fruition if excessive punishment isinflicted from outside.Three recognitions will save the world when the guns cease firing:1. The recognition of joint responsibility for past world conditions. The truththat “all have sinned” must be faced.2. The recognition that, though the German people weakly acquiesced in the ruleof Hitler, they are basically the victims of an organised deception. Since [208]1914 they have been told only lies. The future new world order will inauguratean era of truthful propaganda and national and international information.3. The recognition that the past has gone with all its evils, and that a futureof unlimited possibilities for good and for constructive changes lies ahead. Thefuture must be developed by all nations in the closest collaboration.These three points must be constantly presented to the public in the simplestlanguage, because it is the inert mass of unthinking people who will constitutethe hardest problem. Appeal must be made to the best that is in them, becausethe immediate task ahead is the development of those right attitudes withoutwhich no peace can be lasting and justice will not be possible. Peace must notbe imposed by those who hate war. Peace must be a natural outcome and expressionof the human spirit, and of a determination to change the world attitude intoone of right human relations.This is no impossible idealistic dream, but an immediate possibility, given thespirit of forgiveness and goodwill. Patience will be required, because thenervous strain of war and pain and anxiety, fear and underfeeding will have tobe reckoned with. Human beings will be the same as before the war, except forexhaustion and a willingness on the part of the majority to accept almost anyterms which will allow them to live quietly again, free from the immediate fearof bombs and starvation and ruin. The great need will be for slow action,leaving time for the needed healing processes and adjustment before the finalpeace terms are settled by the nations, sitting in conclave. Nations will haveto shift from a war footing to settled peace activities, and from the organisedtensions of war to the comparative relaxations of peace. Disarmament must goforward as an initial move, but in such a manner that the question ofunemployment is not unduly aggravated. The “turning of the cannon intoploughshares” must be carried out with judgment, and only wide internationalplanning can take care [209] of this stupendous process. The settling ofnational boundaries and spheres of influence will be one of the utmostdifficulty and can only be satisfactorily determined if goodwill is activelypresent and consciously used , and when the wishes of the people involved areconsulted in a non-partisan spirit. The emphasis upon past historical boundariesas a determining factor is ever dangerous. Wise and slow action will here beneeded and proper consideration of population desires. It is not the restorationof the ancient landmarks which is desirable, but the restoration of national andracial spheres of influence in accordance with the present situation.It is not the imposition of any particular ideology upon the world, or itsremoval, which is of importance, but the establishing of those world conditionswhich will give all the nations adequate food, the necessities of life, andopportunity then to express themselves, and to make their unique contribution tothe welfare of the whole family of nations.The working details will have to be developed by all peoples in the closestcollaboration. Men of vision, and not just politicians; world servers, and notjust military leaders; and humanitarians, and not just the rulers of nations,must determine these tremendous issues. As they do so they must be able to countupon the support of the men and women of goodwill in every land. To sum up:The interim between the present time and the final adjustment falls into twomajor periods and the practical work in each can be clearly defined:1. The interim between today and the cessation of war. This must be used in thefollowing ways:a. To educate and stabilise all men and women of goodwill.b. To discover the workers, humanitarians and those men and women ofunderstanding and vision who will respond to the principles here given.c. To prepare these men and women to work in unison for justice and right humanrelations in all countries after the cessation of the war. [210]2. The interim between the end of the physical fighting and the final peacesettlement. It is to be hoped—for the sake of justice—that this interlude willcover several years of rehabilitation and education. During these interludesbetween the past and the new world order, the men and women of goodwill canactively aid the statesmen of all nations by intelligent cooperation, in theplanned focussing of enlightened public opinion, and in defining and teachingthe real meaning of right human relations.It is with the first interlude that we are now concerned.It is desirable to get into immediate touch with those whose names are alreadyknown to you, and set them to work and let them—in their turn—find others, andguide them also into the way of reconstruction. Let all these names andaddresses be gathered together in central and national mailing lists, but letthem also be kept in both New York and London, for it is the task of the Englishspeaking peoples to rebuild the world with the help of all other nations. Theremust, therefore, be some measure of centralisation of the work and some way inwhich these people can be reached and swept into cooperative activity.With goodwill to all, with a staunch belief in the divine possibilities of humanbeings and in the future resurrection of humanity, with an exalted recognitionof God, with an acknowledgment of the fundamental values of Christ’s teaching,and with a joyful determination to go forward with the work of reconstruction, Icall upon those who respond to this vision immediately to set to work.I call you to no organisational loyalties, but only to love your fellowmen, bethey German, American, Jewish, British, French, Negro or Asiatic. I call youfrom your dreams of vague beauty, impossible Utopias and wishful thinking toface life as it is today; and then to begin, in the place where you are, to makeit better. I call you to the experiment of right human relations, beginning withyour own personal relations to your family and friends, and then [211] to thetask of educating those you contact so that they also start a similar work. Itis the work of attaining right individual relations, right group relations,right intergroup relations, right national relations and right internationalrelations. I call you to the realisation that in this work no one is futile oruseless, but that all have a place of practical value. I call you to recognisethat goodwill is a dynamic energy which can bring about world changes of afundamental kind, and that its mode of expression is through the activity of theindividual man and woman and through their massed intent. The massed power ofgoodwill, the dynamic effect of intelligent and active understanding, and thepotency of a trained and alive public opinion which desires the greatest good ofthe greatest number, are beyond belief. This dynamic power has never beenemployed. It can, today, save the world.~THE WORLD CRISIS FROM HIERARCHICAL VIEWPOINTApril-May 1940Another Wesak Festival will be close at hand when you receive thiscommunication. Its urgency, imminence and finality prompt me again to attempt toawaken those of you who receive it to the present opportunity and to thespiritual urgency of this high moment in human affairs. The three Full Moonperiods of April, May and June are most significant and determining, and uponwhat happens during the next few weeks, whilst the sun is still movingnorthwards, much will depend.In this communication I would like to do two things: First of all, give you abetter idea as to how the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet regards the presentworld crisis, and secondly, indicate to you certain major eventualities whichare dependent upon three things:1. A possible divine intervention which may be brought about through theaspiration of all right-minded people, plus the intelligent and constant use ofthe [212] Great Invocation, now being used in its tens of thousands by the worldaspirants in every country.2. The emergence of certain clear lines of demarcation between the activities ofthe Forces of Light and the forces of materialistic aggression.3. The place which clear thinking, wise speech and skill in action should playin the attitude of the world disciples and the men and women of goodwilleverywhere.I shall endeavour to speak with a reasonable brevity and clarity, and I do sowith complete freedom from what you call bias. I speak in terms ofhumanity—without distinction of race, colour or nation; I have no particularpolitical views, because I know that all potential theories, ideologies andgovernments are temporary states and conditions, controlling different groups ofhuman beings on their way from the human state to the divine. This is a point ofview oft overlooked by many of you who—temporarily and oft fanatically—belong toone or other of these ephemeral states of mind and passing human attitudes. Ihave no particular religious preferences, knowing as I do that all roads lead toGod and that the sense of divinity is so dominant and inherent in the humanheart that naught at any time can crush it out; life, experience, trial, painand instinctive human orientation lead all men finally back into the light ofGod. I can and do, therefore, love all men, irrespective of nationality andpresent ideas, as do all with whom I am associated. Looking upon the movingscreen of time with a vision which reaches into the future and is inclusive ofthe past (for this is the prerogative of all trained world disciples) I knowthat present events will play their timely part, will give place to others indue time, and that—when the immediate processes of readjustment in human values,spiritual objectives and political schemes, religious orientations andterritorial syntheses are completed—the world will settle down again to theprocesses of daily living. The immediate opportunity and situation in which wefind ourselves [213] will have proved dynamically useful or (such is the sadpossibility) negatively futile. A fresh cycle of civilisation, culture andgrowth will have been inaugurated which will be coloured by the ancient hues ofselfish desire and aggressive acquisitiveness, or by the newer and morebeautiful colouring of happy and satisfactory international relationships, ofreligious understanding and of the much needed and demanded economiccooperation.Such a dual possibility confronts us now. One—new, right and spirituallyoriented; the other, ancient, evil and undesirable. Whether man will go forwardinto the better way of life or permit the perpetuation of the old ways and thedomination of selfish personal, national and racial interests remains yet to bedetermined.Two things are, however, obvious to us as we look at the present worldsituation; first, that the lines of demarcation between the two ways of livingand the two objective attitudes are far more clearly defined than at anyprevious time in the history of humanity; secondly, that it is the muddledthinking of vast masses of well-meaning people (many of them not immediatelyimplicated in the world conflict) which is largely responsible for the slownessof the final crisis and the postponement of the advancing decision.For decades, we, the teachers of the race of men, have watched certain greatworld (or planetary) tendencies take shape, assume defined and pronouncedoutlines and become conditioning potencies. This shaping and definition wasessential if the issue was to be presented with clarity to humanity, thusenabling a basic choice to be presented to the sons of men and the placing intheir hands of certain determinations which could, if rightly directed, carveout for them a new and better future. Such a presentation has never before beenpossible, because never before has mankind been at the stage where it couldgrasp the situation intelligently, or been so closely and rapidly interrelatedby the radio, telephone, the press and the telegraph. The needed choices can nowbe made in cooperation, in consultation and with open eyes. The choice isclearly before the thinking people [214] in every country, and upon theirdecision rests the fate of the less intelligent masses. Hence the presentresponsibility of the national leaders, of the representatives of the people inthe governments, of the churches, and of the intelligentsia in all lands,without exception. There should be no shirking or evasion of responsibility.There is, however, much.In past communications I have oft spoken of the Forces of Light and the Forcesof Materialism, meaning by these terms the controlling trends towardsbrotherhood, right human relations and selfless purpose, and those which reversethese higher tendencies and bring into human affairs selfish acquisitiveness,emphasis upon material interests, brutal aggression and cruelty. The twopositions are clear to the unprejudiced onlooker.To these two groups I would add a third. This third group is taking shape in theworld today with extreme definiteness and is composed of those who throw theweight of their influence and of their action on neither side; theoretically,they may advocate the higher way, but practically they do nothing to further itsinterests. This third group is formed internally of two groups: first, thosepeople who are potentially weak and are therefore ridden by fear and terror,feeling that they dare not move in any way against the forces of aggression, andsecondly, an intrinsically powerful group who, through selfish materialinterests, plus a sense of separative superiority, or distance from the seat oftrouble and the domination of false values, hold aloof from the situation andshirk their evident responsibility as members of the human family. This lattergroup includes, among others, a number of powerful democracies and republics.Fear, terror and a sense of helpless futility govern the reactions of the one,and who can criticise? Selfishness and separativeness control the other group.You have, therefore, in the world at this time three groups of people who embodythe three major views of the whole of humanity, plus the unthinking masses,swayed by propaganda, controlled by their governments, and the prey [215] of theloudest voices. It is of value to you to get this picture clearly in your minds,and I would like again to define them.1. The ancient entrenched forces of aggression, of material acquisition and pureselfishness, working through a pronounced cruelty which reaches out and graspswhat it wants, irrespective of any other rights, historical and legalpossessions or the will of anyone.2. The forces of spiritual purpose, embodied in the will to protect the rightsof others, along with individual rights; to end aggression and its consequentfear, and to throw the weight of their combined influence on to the side of themost spiritual values, of human freedom, of the right to think, and of kindness.I use the word “kindness” advisedly because it embodies the idea of kin-ship, ofbrotherhood and of right human relations. It is world goodwill in expression,just as the will-to-good is the basis of any possible peace—a goodwill whichwould negate any premature peace at this time, because the latter would givetime for the Forces of Materialism to consolidate their gains and prepare theway for further aggression. Kindness, the will-to-good and peace—such should bethe practical expression and the formulated intention of those who areconditioned by the Forces of Light.3. The force of mass negativity, as expressed today by the dominated people inthe strongholds of aggression and by the neutrally minded people everywhere.They are all coloured by racial fear, by the instinct to self-preservation, andby short-sighted selfish interest.The problem is one of exceeding difficulty because, even though the lines ofdemarcation are becoming steadily more distinct, yet the exponents of thesethree groups are to be found in every land and among all people—in every churchand in every home. No nation or group is exempt from this triplicity. It isrooted in human attitudes, and that is why this conflict is a strictly humanconflict and not a European war. Every nation has its selfish, aggressivepeople, who believe that might is right and that men must be [216] governed bythe law of the jungle, taking what they want, no matter at what cost to others.Every nation has those within its borders who see the vision of right humanrelations, who seek to live by the law of brotherhood, who respond to theinfluence of the Forces of Light and of the spiritual Hierarchy, and who desirepeace, kindness and goodwill to rule world affairs and control the policies ofthe governments. Every nation has also within it those neutrally-minded peoplewho fail to think clearly, who seek to place the blame upon the shoulders of allexcept themselves, who theorise and speculate, advise, and assignresponsibility, but who refrain from any active participation in the processesof adjustment, from reasons of pride or unwillingness to pay the price. Many ofthem are group conscientious objectors who will eventually profit by the victoryof the Forces of Light but who refuse to share in the struggle, reservingthemselves for the future peace settlements, longing for the conflict to end,but doing nothing to bring that about. Many are entirely sincere, but theirthinking needs adjusting.If you will rightly grasp the reality of the statements made above, you will doyour share in the mental clarification which is going on in the world. Thesethree groups are functioning today and are in conflict. The neutrally-mindedgroup is definitely hindering the work of the Forces of Light. These three worldattitudes are to be found in every nation, as well as in the consciousness ofevery single individual. The realisation of this may enable you to grasp andshoulder your individual responsibility better. You will realise the need toascertain for yourself where you stand and will refuse to be conditioned byother people’s points of view and the world-wide propaganda; you will appreciatewhere your nation stands and on which side, and where you, as a soul, stand. Youwill then be able—if you are sincere and clear-thinking—to work for that groupwithin the whole which seems to you to embody the highest possible activity andaims, and you will relinquish that attitude of futile negativity, smugneutrality or bewildered confusion which may [217] distinguish you. You willthen emerge from the glamour of propaganda and of world illusion into the clearlight of your own soul, whose essential nature is love and selflessness andwhose major aspiration is to bring peace and goodwill among men and to see theconsummation of the mission of Christ.This will lead eventually to the disappearance of so-called neutrality uponearth—a neutrality in act, for there is never neutrality in thought.One of the things which the spiritual leaders of humanity have sought to do isto bring clearly to the attention of men the basic duality which is found in theworld today—the duality of selfish, material living and that of unselfishspiritual objectives. This is now clearly defined. The second stage of theirtask now lies ahead, and that is so to stimulate the vision of men everywherethat—beginning with the intelligentsia—they can consciously take their standunder one or other of the two banners, and so know what they are doing and why.The neutrally-minded waver between the two and, to date, do nothing.I would like in this connection to deal with one problem which has somewhatdisturbed the least clear-thinking among those whom I have for some time taught.I have for years sought to develop in the world a group of men and women whowould stand for the spiritual values, who would love all men, who would fosterthe spirit of goodwill, and who would stand to humanity (as far as they could)as the Hierarchy of Light, as Christ and His disciples seek to do. This has beeninterpreted by some of you as meaning that you must refrain from rebellingagainst the evil thing in your midst, and from all criticism and partisanship.You seem unable to love with steadfastness the offender and yet to rid the worldof the offence. The situation might clarify if you answered to yourself one ortwo questions:Do you believe that the Hierarchy of Light, under the leadership of Christ, ison the side of cruelty, aggression and the slaughter of the defenceless?[218] Do you believe that the world can be saved by a refusal to think and bythe shirking of individual responsibility, thus ignoring a situation which doesexist?Do you feel that there are no issues and principles which are worth fighting forand dying for, if need be?Do you stand with the Forces of Light or with the Forces of Materialism?What are you doing to aid the side which claims your allegiance, loyalty andidealism?Are you governed by a sense of individual futility—that weapon which the Forcesof Materialism are using now so potently to stun possible opponents intohelplessness?A clear and searching analysis of the spiritual objectives of humanity willenable you to answer these questions. If you do not need to answer them becauseyour position is clear in your mind, the study of the questions may enable youto serve your day and generation more ably and to present the situation moreclearly to the bewildered.A horror of war and a longing for peace are no excuse for slack thinking, nor dothey provide an alibi or the opportunity to shirk individual or nationalresponsibility. The conflict is on. It is of ancient lineage. The issues areclearly marked between right and wrong, between cruelty and kindness, betweenaggression and freedom. To evade responsibility because of past nationalmistakes and historical sins and failures is an unwarranted alibi; the shirkingof due participation in the struggle because every nation has certainmaterialistic objectives is wrong; a nation is but the sum total of its people.To refuse to think because of the general condition of fatigue in which youshare is no excuse, and is unworthy of the world disciples and aspirants.The Hierarchy of Light is seeking to arouse men everywhere to the basic dualismunderlying this conflict and to the essential significance of the issues withwhich humanity is faced. Hence the emphasis which I am laying upon the need toface the problem, to think clearly and intelligently about what is going onaround you, and to take right and cooperative action. The whole world problemwill be clarified [219] and the end of the conflict more rapidly reached whenthere are only two parties and not three. The recognition of this underlyingdualism is necessary prior to the shifting of humanity’s consciousness away fromits major preoccupation—acquisitive material desire, aggressively obtained—intosoul consciousness, with its correlations, group interests, the meeting of groupneed, and the functioning of a steady group cooperation on a world scale. Thisis true of individuals, of nations and of races; as you, an individual, work outyour own problem in your daily life, you are helping to solve the world problem.This is the situation as the Hierarchy sees it today and with which itchallenges all men and women of goodwill. They ask you to share in the conflictin some way, and remind you of the occult significance of those oftmisunderstood words of Christ, “He that is not with me, is against me.”In closing these remarks upon clear thinking I would add two more. There is someconfusion arising out of the basic idealism which underlies the activities ofmany people in many countries. It is the importance of the somewhat new ideal ofthe good of the state as a whole versus the good of the individual and the goodof humanity. The state becomes almost a divine entity in the consciousness ofthe idealist. This is necessarily part of the evolutionary plan, but in so faras it constitutes a problem, is too big for the individual to solve alone andunaided. Of one fundamental truth I can, however, assure you. When meneverywhere—within the boundaries of their particular state and whilst upholdingits authority and its civilisation—begin to think in terms of mankind, thenpublic opinion will become so potent and so right in its inclusiveness thatstate policies must inevitably conform to the larger ideal, and the sacrifice ofthe individual and of humanity in large numbers to the individual state will nolonger be possible. The part will be seen in its proper relation to the largerwhole. It is this arousing of public opinion to world rights, to inclusive humaninterests and to international cooperation that is the true goal of all presentspiritual endeavour. Eventually it will be [220] realised that theresponsibility for what governments do rests squarely upon the shoulders of theindividual citizens who put governments in their position of power. This is aresponsibility from which no citizens of any nation are or should be exempt, andto this all national thinking of the right kind is fortunately awakening.The second point I would briefly add is that, with the precipitation of thepresent world situation, the citizens of all nations are involved in a conditionfrom which there is no escape except through right action and wide vision ontheir part; to this world situation they must conform their lives temporarily,patterning their activities upon the needs of their own particular nation. Forthose who are swept into the world conflict under one or other of the clearlydefined banners, their immediate action is clear—participation in the nationalemergency. This is, however, wholly compatible with a subjective process ofright and clear thinking, which must run parallel to the demanded outer activityand which will lay a foundation for the increasingly right action as timeelapses. This will involve right action on the part of those who are fightingunder the Forces of Light, and will lead to an eventual right and just peace; itwill involve also right action upon the part of those who have been swept into abewildered activity under the Forces of Materialism, leading finally to a revoltagainst that which is wrong and evil—for the hearts of all men and the springsof the divine life are not to be permanently directed into wrong channels ofactivity. The responsibility for the immediate world moves and the presentgigantic national enterprises is now out of the hands and the control of theindividual; the responsibility for the future, nevertheless, still lies in hishands. This shouldering of right responsibility must be preceded, however, by aninterlude of clear thinking plus right action as a citizen.The problem of those living in neutral countries is different, and along whatlines it should be solved I have earlier indicated.[221] As for the world disciples and aspirants (among whom you rangeyourselves), the entire problem can be seen along still wider and morecomprehensive lines. You are forced by circumstance and karma, and by the freedecision of your souls, to work under one or other of the two banners or in someone of the neutral and negative countries. Your problem in all three cases is tosee clearly the spiritual focus of this world crisis, to swing the weight of anyinfluence you may have—objective or subjective, spiritual, emotional ormental—on to the side of the Forces of Light. As you do so, you must preserve anunderstanding attitude of steadfast love (not sentiment or emotional reaction)to men and women everywhere, without any exception or reservations in yourconsciousness. That action has to be taken, at times, which hurts or damages theform side of life or the physical forms, is entirely compatible with theconstant preservation of soul love—a thing which it is hard for the disciple tolearn and master, but which is nevertheless a governing principle in evolution.This world crisis and the present world war will, it is hoped, awaken men to therealisation that the form side of manifestation, with its aggressiveselfishness, its cruel emphases and its separative tendencies, carriesinevitably with it the seeds of its own eventual elimination and the unavoidableresults of pain, suffering, war, disease and death. This situation is thereforeof man’s own making and the result of his material nature and lack of soulcontrol. But—the soul is eternal; its nature is inclusive love; and the wholeaim of the present crisis is to shift the focus of human awareness out of theform and the material aspect of living, into the consciousness of the soul, andto do this at any cost to the hindering forms. It is against this transferenceof emphasis that the Forces of Materialism are today fighting.For this reason, humanity is swept into a vortex of conflict, and the issuedepends upon the clear thinking, wise speech and selfless intent of the worlddisciples, working in collaboration with all the forces for good in the worldtoday, doing their duty as citizens of their own country but cultivatingceaselessly and unrelentingly a world-consciousness.[222] Let me now enlarge somewhat upon the possibility of divine intervention.Hovering today within the aura of our planet are certain great spiritual Forcesand Entities, awaiting the opportunity to participate actively in the work ofworld redemption, re-adjustment and reconstruction. Their Presence is sensed attimes by the spiritually-minded people of the world, and Their reality isrecognised by the mystics and occultists working in every land. Men and womenexpress this recognition according to the trend of their religious andpsychological training and their particular mental or emotional bias. The adventof Christ, or His “second coming,” is anxiously anticipated by many orthodoxChristians, who regard this world war as indicating the end of the world and aspreparatory to the appearance of the Christ, to bring peace on earth. Others,more orientally minded, await the appearance of an Avatar Who will transmit fromGod the needed world message or new type of energy. Prophecy and astrologyindicate a Coming One and their many differing opinions seem to converge on Him;occultists invoke everywhere the Forces of Light and call for the appearance ofthat extra-planetary Potency to Whom they give the title, “Spirit of Peace.”Those with no religious or metaphysical bias recognise, however, that all timesof emergency seem ever to evoke some Liberator or some man or group of men whoare capable of changing world affairs and inaugurating—under the stress andstrain of the times—the new and needed fresh cycle of civilisation and culture.Many refrain from specification of the requirements of such a Coming One today,because of the magnitude and planetary nature of His task, but they secretlyhope and pray for His appearing. Still others regard such an idea and hope assimply a psychological fulfilment and the embodiment of the wish-life of thepeople—this time of humanity as a whole, for the first time in racial history.Such people are apt to feel that this embodiment has no true substance or placein the life of mankind, but wish that it had. They forget that when athoughtform has been constructed of sufficient potency and [223] has been builtover a long period of time by the people of the world, a further and final stagebecomes ever possible. The form can be rendered so magnetic that it can attractan Energy which will inform it and give it active potency; it can then become avital link between the subjective world of energy and the objective world offorces and a thing of power, of impelling and guiding activity, and thereforethe expression of a Life. This thoughtform, duly informed, becomes a mediatingfactor, constructed by humanity but animated by the will-to-good of some greatand spiritual Entity. That thoughtforms, embodying evil lives can be and areconstructed is equally true, but with these we are not at this time dealing.We come now to the significant point of what I have to say today in thisconnection.A great and vital thoughtform is in process of construction upon our planet andwithin our planetary aura. It is being built by the power of sound, by themagnetic pull of invocation leading to eventual evocation, and by the force ofdesire-substance, animated by the power of thought. It is being constructed bythe united efforts of the Hierarchy, of the world disciples and aspirants, ofthe men and women of goodwill in all nations, and also through the inchoatelongings of men everywhere, of all religious beliefs, political views and grouployalties. It is safely anchored upon the physical plane, is of vast proportionsupon the astral or emotional plane, but lacks vitality and power upon the mentalplane. It is here, within the realm of thought substance, that the weakness ofthe structure of this thoughtform becomes apparent. It is already potentspiritually, owing to the scientific work of the occult Hierarchy and Theirtrained helpers. This spiritual life relates the thoughtform to the waitingextra-planetary Forces and can make Their work possible and effective. It ispotent physically and emotionally through the work of the lovers of humanity,the well-meaning efforts of the emotionally oriented people and the agonisedlongings of the masses, who [224] hate war, desire quiet, and demand peace andgood living conditions.There is, however, a gap or hiatus upon the mental plane, for the minds of menare not functioning correctly. The disciples and world aspirants are notthinking with clarity, nor are they working in unity. They are evading issues orare thinking separatively or nationally or fanatically; they are not convincedof the potency of invocation or of prayer; they are failing to realise that itis possible to work ardently for those conditions which will lead to peace, andyet fight simultaneously so that those conditions may be available; they fail tolove all men without exception in their longing to see their own loyaltiesemerge triumphant; they work doubtingly, hoping for the best but believing inthe worst; they use the method of prayer and of invocation because such methodsseem to have been successful in the past, and because they are told that “faithcan move mountains,” but they feel inwardly quite hopeless and uninspired andare not at all sure what faith intrinsically is; they realise that a unitedfront and a spirit of joyous certainty are psychological assets of well-nighinvincible potency, but they feel unable to arouse within themselves theslightest enthusiasm.It is this negative and lukewarm attitude, this mental uncertainty and thisfailure to link up the spiritual and the physical worlds in a positiverelationship which is holding back the Forces of Light and the actual presenceof the Spirit of Peace, and thus negativing a possible divine intervention. Itis the test of group work. The faith of many individuals is real and deep, butthey stand alone; the knowledge that the few have of the nature of the waitingForces of intervention is being negated by the faithlessness of the worlddisciples and aspirants, weighed down by world karma, by their own physicalfatigue and by their horror of the present situation, plus the difficulties ofindividual circumstance.The problem can be most simply stated. Either the spiritual Hierarchy exists,with all its potencies of love, wisdom and skill in action, or for ages humanityhas suffered [225] from hallucinations; either Christ and His group of Masters,initiates and disciples are facts in the natural processes of evolution,historically proven and known through Their spiritual activity down the ages, ormen have been victims during those ages of a gigantic fraud—emanating from whatand where? Either the consistency of the evolving presentation of the spiritualeffort of the Hierarchy is a witness to a great reality or mankind has developeda mentality which is an instrument for the fabrication of non-existent facts,and this is in itself so paradoxical as to give the lie to the inference. Eitherthe spiritual worlds and the three worlds of human endeavour can be related, orthere is nothing to past beliefs, to ancient stories of manifesting divinity andto the constantly recurring periods of divine intervention.I would here face you with these alternatives and would ask you to consider yourown position in these matters. Does the story of Easter and of the living Christcarry no truth, and is it not possible for that Risen Christ to express Hispower on Earth through His chosen instruments? Is there no foundation for themyth of the annual return of the Buddha, holding the door open between Shamballaand the Hierarchy so that, at need, intervention may be possible through thatopen door? Is it only a silly dream and a fantasy that at the time of the JuneFull Moon, Christ—in the closest cooperation with the Buddha—links the Hierarchywith Humanity? Is it quite impossible that when humanity awakens to the fact ofthis mediatorship and can then avail itself of the straight line of ascent anddescent through the doors held open by the Buddha and the Christ, somestupendous appearing may be imminent and suddenly take place? May it not bepossible that through the ascent of man’s aspiration and spiritual desire, andthrough the descent of the waiting Potencies, certain great changes may takeplace, for which all the past has been only preparatory and through which theAquarian Age of brotherhood and understanding may make itself felt by virtue ofthese great Potencies?The two Full Moons of May and June present to you [226] a new opportunity toparticipate in the release of the planetary Life from the thraldom of the Forcesof Materialism. If you are to do your share in this work of salvage, it willnecessitate certain attitudes and activities on your part which I would likebriefly to touch upon, leaving you to take right and appropriate action and tofollow, with all other disciples and aspirants, the indicated stages:1. Study with care and answer with sincerity and to your own completesatisfaction the questions I put to you earlier in this communication. When youhave done this, you will know where you personally stand.2. For the entire week prior to the May Full Moon and the June Full Moonendeavour to do the following things:a. Link up with all disciples, aspirants and men and women of goodwillthroughout the world and in all nations, using the creative imagination.b. Eliminate out of your consciousness all negativity, seeing yourself clearlyas ranged on the side of the Forces of Light; you are, therefore, not neutral inthought. See to it also that when taking right action in the conflict againstthe forces of materialism you preserve ever a spirit of love for all individualswho have been swept into the vortex of their potency.c. When meditating and invoking the Forces of Light, endeavour to forgetentirely all your own personal difficulties, tragedies and problems. Discipleshave to learn to carry forward their work for humanity in spite of personalitystresses, strains and limitations.d. Prepare yourselves thus for the work of the two Full Moons, keeping yourobjective clearly in mind and submitting yourselves to an adequate temporarydiscipline.3. For the two days prior to the Full Moon, on the day of the Full Moon itself,and for the two succeeding days (five days) endeavour at sunrise, at noon, atfive o’clock P.M., and at sunset, plus the exact time of the Full Moon in yourown [227] land, to say the Great Invocation with the intent to invoke,precipitate and anchor in outer manifestation the waiting Potencies. Do thisaloud when possible, and in group formation whenever feasible. It is thefocussed power of your unemotional thought which will bridge the presentexisting gap and link more closely the two worlds of spiritual activity and ofhuman demonstration.4. Repeat this activity for three days each and every month—the day prior to theFull Moon, the day of the Full Moon, and the succeeding day. As a preliminaryexercise to these three days, you could take an earlier three days ofpreparation, and thus increase the effectiveness of your effort.Many people the world over have for years been trained to recognise two things.First, the importance of the Wesak Festival at the time of the Full Moon of May,because it not only objectively links the major Eastern religion with the majorWestern faith, but because it esoterically provides the key to the open doorbetween Shamballa and the Hierarchy, between the purpose of God (stillunidentified by man, owing to his relatively low stage of evolution which makesit beyond human comprehension at present) and the method of God, which is love;it provides also the link between the Buddha, temporarily embodying will-wisdom,and the Christ, embodying love-wisdom, and also between humanity, focussed inconsciousness through the Christ, and the Hierarchy, focussed in consciousnessthrough the Buddha. Owing to the stress of humanity today and the urgency of theresponse which that distress evokes in the Hierarchy, the synthesis of these tworeactions to the world crisis can prove adequate to bring in that outsideassistance which could end the conflict along right lines and bring not onlyrelief, but illumination to the human consciousness. But again—speaking here toa representative body of aspirants and disciples—I would state that the focusand the emphasis is not yet adequate to guarantee this extra-planetary response.Nevertheless, it could be if, in your own life of meditation [228] and ofdiscipline, in your speech with others and in the general tone of yourintercourse with your environment, you can eliminate the negative and moreselfish reactions and (for the sake of human welfare) temporarily, at least,live at your highest point of aspiration.Secondly, you have been trained in the belief that all the information which Ihave given out anent the relation of the Buddha and the Christ, and of theHierarchy, Humanity and Shamballa, will form part of the coming new worldreligion and that the theme of the Great Approaches will constitute the basicfundamentals of the future spiritual teaching. This too you must have in mind,for the work you are asked to do at the coming two Full Moons, and during theless important full moons of the year, is not only related to the presentemergency, but is also constructively related to the future faith of humanity.Bear this also in mind.You will note that what I have said concerns your mental attitudes and youremotional reactions to present world affairs. It concerns also your soultension, your willingness to undergo soul tension, and your capacity to stand aspart of the great chain of intermediaries who are today being called to theservice of the race in an hour of urgency. It concerns the organising ofyourself as an integrated personality in relation to your soul and to humanity;it involves the recognition of the work which you can do from the point ofintegration. I would ask you to ponder with care upon this paragraph, statingthe possibilities of your task.I call you to a period of clear thinking. I seek not to mould your politicalapproach to life, but I do seek to aid you to see humanity and its welfare—notonly in terms of your own nation or your own political group—but in terms of thewhole, and as we, the teachers on the inner side, are forced to see it. I seekto see you free yourselves from the condition where you are swayed by propagandaof a political, national or religious kind, and deciding for yourself where you,as a soul, must stand in this world crisis and on which side you will place theemphasis of any influence you may wield; I would have you note where yourhighest ideals [229] will lead you and whether the springs of your life’sdecisions and attitudes are truly pure and unadulterated.I seek to draw your attention away from the many minor issues, the manyclamouring voices, and from the widespread concentration upon the unworthy pastsand the undesirable aspects of all nations (without exception), and help you tosee with clarity the major dualism which underlies the present worldconflict—might against right, materialism against the higher values, freedomagainst imprisonment, cruelty against fair dealing, liberty and safety againstfear and aggression. Then, having balanced these pairs of opposites within yourconsciousness, decide where your loyalty, your interest and your ability toserve will be placed, and then go forward to further the ends of one or other ofthe two groups, at no matter what cost, but knowing where you stand and why youstand there.That the will of Shamballa may be enabled to express itself through love andthrough the meditation of the Hierarchy, working through all disciples,aspirants and men and women of goodwill, is the earnest prayer of your fellowdisciple and co-worker.~THE WORLD CRISIS TODAYJune 30, 1940Events and situations change with such rapidity at this time, as humanity takesaction or refrains from action (which latter course is just as determining forgood or evil as is the former), that I feel again the need of writing on theworld crisis, as I did last autumn, thus carrying forward my theme. I write asone who is working on the inner side today, sensing and seeing what is hiddenfrom many of you. The exoteric outer history of events is known to all of you,and with its detail I need not deal. The action taken by the combatant nations,or withheld by the neutral nations, is also registered in your consciousness.The implications of such activity can only be truly known and appreciated bythose people who today think in terms of humanity as a [230] whole, and not interms of a particular nation, such as the good of Germany or the destiny ofAmerica. Few disciples there are at this time who can thus think syntheticallyor who see the vision as a whole, precipitating as that which will conditioneventually the entire human family. Many there are who are awakening to the needso to do and who are finding, in their processes of readjustment, manybewildering problems. For these sincere but bewildered people, I write. I findthat there is little that I can say to the provincially minded or to those withthe purely parochial point of view. Their limitations of vision lie withinthemselves and only dire events and strenuous emergency will enable them finallyto transcend the petty quibbling and quality of their lower mind, with itsconcrete tendency to hark back to the past and its fear to venture with faithinto the future.I have been interested in the response to my earlier article, written in April,1940. The majority of those whom I sought to reach and with whom I havecommunicated for many years accepted my premises without much questioning butrefrained from positive action or the use of any influence. A few resented theimplications of the existent divisions between the Forces of Light (focussedthrough the allied nations) and the Forces of Aggression (focussed throughGermany). They embody a true, but erroneously interpreted, idea of human unity.They fail to understand that—as the New Age is ushered in—there must inevitablycome a judgment day (speaking symbolically) and the emergence of a clear line ofdemarcation between that which is new and that which is of the old age; theremust appear the distinction between exoteric happenings and esoteric attitudesand between those who see a new world order, developed and brought tofunctioning activity by the Forces of Light, through cooperation, coordinationand understanding, and a world order which will be imposed by terror, throughdictatorial government, by the suppression of liberty of conscience, and by theenthronement of a race whose values are, at this time, anti-spiritual andanti-social. This judgment day is now upon humanity, and the final decision willbe [231] arrived at by those whose normal inclinations and natural tendenciesare on the side of law and order, and whose will-to-good is directed towardsright human relations and true human welfare. These enlightened people will backtheir judgment with a focussed will to bring in the era wherein these valueswill dominate, and they are also willing to take the necessary measures to makethese values possible.I would like to deal openly and frankly with the problems with which you arebeing confronted when you face the world as it is today and the world as it maybe tomorrow—a world whose fate is still unsettled. I would present possibilitieswith a definite application to the reactions of such empires as those of GreatBritain, France and Holland, and with indication as to how the United States ofAmerica should be expected to respond. I write as one who represents theHierarchy, as a member of a certain standing in its ranks, and as one also whoworks day and night for the success of those nations in the human family who,with their backs to a wall of misunderstanding, vilification and dislike, arestrenuously opposing Germany and her satellite, Italy. I refer to that group ofAllies who today stand with their purpose focussed in Great Britain, driventhere by the trend of events. I do this because the basic hope of right humanrelations, of true and lasting peace, of liberty of conscience and of free andhappy homes rests upon their triumphing; they are, at this time, the point ofpositive attack by the Forces of Evil. It is not possible for us as yet to reachthe soul of the German people within that unhappy land, so complete is theglamour under which they are labouring. The day will come when again they willbe reached, and this responsibility rests upon those Germans who remain freefrom glamour in other lands; it will come when the forces acting through themedium of a band of evil-intentioned men have been removed. With theirdisappearance will come the dissipation of the clouds of evil propaganda, lyinginformation and distorted imputations and interpretations with which the massesof people, even in neutral lands, have been deluged.[232] Would you have me at this time of planetary crisis refrain from directspeech, have me withhold from you who read my words the truth—a truth which isalready apparent to those who ponder the signs of the times with an unprejudicedmind, unbiased thought and a true love of humanity? This last quality, a truelove of humanity, constitutes a basic test of wrong or right action. It isphenomenally clarifying if applied at this time to the combatants. Would youhave me deal with pleasant platitudes anent a future happy world, when perhapsthe very possibility of such a world trembles in the balance? Would you have mepresent the attitude of the Hierarchy as that of a placid band of onlookers,ready to help the world when the conflict is over, but at present insulated fromall action and simply waiting till the dust and clamour of battle settle, tostimulate in men’s minds the vision of a new world order wherein everyone willhave a good time, where there will be no unemployment, wherein fear and terrorwill find no place and everyone will be happy, well fed and reasonablyintelligent? Would you have me picture to you the great band of disciples,initiates and aspirants as a band of pacifists, cherishing the form side oflife, afraid of death and remaining passive in the face of the death struggle ofhuman liberty, of life, conscience and mind?I tell you that this I cannot do. The Hierarchy is very different from this.Pacifism, as interpreted by you, has no place in its ranks. The destruction ofform in battle (which causes so much fear to many of you) is of small importanceto those who know that reincarnation is a basic law of nature and that there isno death . The forces of death are abroad today, but it is the death of liberty,the death of free speech, the death of freedom in human action, the death oftruth and of the higher spiritual values. These are the vital factors in thelife of humanity; the death of the physical form is a negligible factor inrelation to these, and one easily righted again through the processes of rebirthand fresh opportunity.I would say to those who preach a passive attitude in the face of evil and humansuffering and who endorse a [233] pacifism which involves no risks: With what doyou propose to fight the forces of aggression, of treachery, evil anddestruction which are today stalking over our planet? What weapons do you bringto this combat? How will you begin to stem the onslaught and arrest thewhirlwind? Will you use prayers for peace, and then patiently wait for theforces of good to fight your battle and for God to do the work? I tell you thatyour prayers and your wishes are unavailing when divorced from right and potentaction. Your prayers and petitions may reach the throne of God, symbolicallyspeaking, but then the reply comes forth: The Forces of Light will strengthenyour arms and turn the tide in your favour if you stand up and fight for thatwhich you desire. Who will arrest the progress of aggressive selfishness if themen and women of goodwill rest back upon their idealism and do naught that ispractical to justify their hope or aid in the materialisation of the desiredideal.There are those in the world today who (despite past national selfishness andwrong) are fearlessly and with true insight fighting humanity’s battle, and withthem the Hierarchy stands, as it has ever stood on the side of liberty, rightunderstanding and correct attitudes in human affairs. I would say to those whocry, “Peace, peace when there is no peace”: Are you going to profit by theirdeath and sacrifice when the ultimate triumph of the Forces of Light comes topass? Are you going to take the position that you can then live in a safe worldbecause others gave their lives that you might do so? Are you going to issueforth from the safe security of your pacifist alibi and gratefully acknowledgewhat they have done and grasp your share of the gains which they have purchasedat such a cost? I would warn you not to be glamoured by the false premise thatyou must stand by your hard-earned convictions, even at the expense of otherpeoples’ lives and the downfall of nations, forgetting that fear and false pridewill make this argument of importance to you. Are the peace-minded people of theworld going to reap the benefits of a peace for which they have paid no price?It is the people who value peace above all [234] else who are today seeking byevery possible method to stop Germany.Let me tell you something about the peace for which the Hierarchy works andwhich the spiritually minded people of the world envisage even whilst theyfight, and for which they are ready to pay the ultimate price. Peace, when itcomes, will be the result of right world conditions and right humanrelationships. It is an effect and not a cause; it is the effect of certainsubjective attitudes which are not yet present in the world on a sufficientlywide scale. Against these emerging conditions Germany has assembled her potentwar machine, after years of scientific and planned preparation. Today the Alliesstand waiting the opportunity for the final struggle with that potent nation,prepared to institute afterwards those conditions which will guarantee peace.There is no peace on the planet anywhere today. There is no peace in thequestioning hearts of those who are not actively sharing in the struggle againstevil. There is no peace in any field of human endeavour. It is not to be foundin the economic field, torn as it is by the conflict between labour and capital,and between great schools of economic thought; it is not to be found in thereligious field, where the struggle is going on between authority (tainted withold world churchianity) and experimental religion; it is not to be found in thesocial order, where class is ranged against class, poor against rich, and managainst his brother; it is certainly not in the political field, where partystrife controls and blinds the warring groups, hiding the wider vision of worldaffairs and the needs of humanity as a whole. There is no peace, and peace willnot come through an applied and fanatical pacifism or through the loud talkingand wishful thinking of those who hate war and who at the same time swell thetide of conquest and delay true victory by their violently uttered opposingviews.I tell you that all nations hate and oppose war; even Germany, behind theimposed terror, shrinks in horror at what is being done. The same love of peacewhich inspires the ordinary pacifist inspires those who are today fighting [235]in order that peace may be the result of their sacrifice and the effect of theestablishing of those right conditions which Germany is set to prevent. Yet manyneutrally minded and pacifist people are unwilling to pay any price for whatthey profess so much to cherish. A complete refusal to fight on the part of theAllies and of those who are seeing with clarity the issues at stake would openthe door to the world domination of the Forces of Materialism and Aggression. Itis upon this that these evil forces count when they face the greatest neutral ofall, the United States of America, and for which they are preparing as theydisseminate their lying propaganda and plant their agents in every country andevery state—preparatory to a peaceful conquest of a people who refusesufficiently to value the spiritual issues at stake to take positive action.And we, the teachers on the inner side, who for aeons have aided in thepreparation of humanity for the coming age of peaceful cooperation andbrotherhood, see all this future hope imperilled. Aggression and the rape ofpeaceful nations go steadily forward, as nation after nation crumbles under theiron heel of Germany, grinding the peoples of the world and sweeping them intoslavery on a scale of serfdom and cruelty that the world has never before seen.As those who sought to arrest German progress succumb to treachery and pain anddesert their comrades, the machine of evil marches on; neutral nations, restingback upon their peaceful intent and the claims of civilisation, are absorbed bythe forces which impose the German demand for living space, and are thus denudedof liberty, of territory, and of all economic resources. And, at the same time,the greatest and most powerful neutral nation in the world arms for defence ofits territorial rights, but refuses to arm for the defence of human liberty.Do I speak too strongly to those of you who are not participating in thisplanetary war? I speak with clarity because I seek to arouse you to the trueissues whilst there is yet time. I seek to arrest in you the idea that thewestern hemisphere is the seat of all civilisation, the custodian of [236] thebest that there is in humanity, and that the spiritual future of humanity liesin the cherished land of liberty. Liberty is a thing of the human soul and isfound throughout the entire human race. Civilisation is a universal human rightand not the prerogative of one nation. I tell you that humanity is everywherespiritually minded and that the new race, the coming civilisation, and the newage culture will be found throughout the world—the universal inheritance of thehuman race. But everywhere humanity is the victim of propaganda—a propagandawhich can only be seen in its true light when men think in terms of humanliberty; when they together take the needed steps to ensure human happiness, andlearn in so doing to face world conditions as they are, not hiding their headsin a dream world of their own making. The world of the future, of which men inall lands dream, is more than a possibility if men will shoulder their justresponsibilities and together make it a fact in human experience. But such aworld will not be possible for many long years if Europe goes down in the crashof battle and under the impact of the German war machine. It will emerge intorealisation when there are enough people in the world who think clearly, see thevision truly, act intelligently, and meet force with force, which is the onlymethod which the forces of aggression can understand.Today the forces of evil have swept over France, Belgium, Holland, Norway,Poland, Finland and Roumania. Nothing has arrested their progress—neither truthnor armed might nor sacrifice. Today Great Britain stands with a handful of herallies upholding the banner of human liberty. With her stand France (for Franceis still loyal in her thousands to truth and liberty), Poland, Holland, Norwayand Belgium—all represented in that small fortress of the Forces of Light whichis the British Isles. Behind stand their great empires with their resources asyet untouched. Behind them again stand the spiritually minded peoples in everynation, and behind them all stands the Hierarchy of Light. In this interludeprior to the final struggle I write to those [237] who are looking on withsympathy but without sacrifice and I ask you: Where do you stand?I bring to you some of the contrasts in this war, in all simplicity and in aneffort to enable you to choose right action.The first great contrast might be called the way of appeasement and the way ofaggression. The method of peaceful discussion was tried by the peace-lovingpeoples of France and Great Britain, and the way of aggression, developed formany years, is the way of Germany, of Russia, and in a lesser degree of Italy. Iwould remind you that it is to the eternal credit of the Allies (e’en though itlacked worldly common sense) that their preparations for war proved inadequatein the face of German preparedness. They were not one-pointed in their wareffort, for the higher value of world civilisation engrossed them and theactivities of their empires, which live at peace within themselves. They havemade many grievous errors in the past (as have all peoples), but the way ofexpiation and of sacrifice is theirs, willingly accepted, and their reward isthe freedom of humanity.I will give you another contrast, growing out of the above. This is the emphasisupon a new world order within a rapidly changing world. The Allies uphold onepoint of view; the Germans, another. It is for this new and better world and thebringing in of the conditions wherein peace can be possible and the new worldorder developed that today the men of vision fight and die. The contrast is theenforced world order, emphasised by the so-called “German super-race,” whichwill centralise the world around Germany, for the aggrandisement of Germany, forthe expansion of the German living space and the supply of Germany’s economicneed—an order enforced by terror, by cruelty and death, ignoring the needs ofhumanity as a whole and the rights of all other nations, and sacrificing thewhole world, if need be, to the glory of Germany. With this German-enforced ruleand order, her greed for territorial expansion and her ruthless acquisition ofthe goods and possession [238] of other nations, I would ask you to contrast theexpressed aim of the Allies, reiterated again and again in the speeches of thestatesmen of both France and Great Britain and summed up in the words of a greatEnglishman, a government official and an aspirant to right and truth:“We shall use all our influence when the time comes in the building of a newworld in which the nations will not permit insane armed rivalry to deny theirhopes of fuller life and future confidence nor be forever overborne by grimforeboding of disaster. The new world that we seek will enlist the cooperationof all peoples on a basis of human equality, self-respect and mutual tolerance.We shall have to think out many things that lie on the route of internationalcontacts—social, political and economic—and find means of reconciling thenecessity of change in a constantly changing world with security against thedisturbance of the general peace through resort to violence. To this order thatwe shall create, all nations have their contribution to make, and a greatresponsibility both in thought and action will rest upon our people. We, notless than others, have our lesson to learn from past failures anddisappointments.”I would have you note the recognition, by this spokesman for the Allies, of theneed of change, the realisation of the coming world order and the humblestatement anent past mistakes.I would call your attention very briefly also to the contrast in the methodsemployed: cruelty versus kindness, merciless bombing and machine gunning on theone side, and the constant refraining from attack upon the enemy by the Allies,for fear of killing the defenceless; I would call your attention to thebroadcast from Great Britain, warning the Germans to take cover when they hearthe British planes over Germany. I would call your attention to the reticent buttruthful propaganda which lays no [239] emphasis upon that which could stir uphate, and the lying information from Berlin and conquered cities. It is not mypurpose to do more than indicate these contrasts which grow out of a widelydiffering subjective attitude to humanity. It is, however, of value for us allto face them in the process of clarifying issues. The basic contrast betweenfreedom of speech, thought and action which distinguishes the democracies, andthe cruel suppression of all liberty of thought and personal activity whichcontrols the masses in Germany today, is too well known to require emphasisingby me. But I bring these contrasts to your attention, asking you to recogniseyour responsibility to stand behind those who fight for liberty and to end theactivity of those who are the enemies of all human freedom.I would ask you to exercise your imagination in an effort to visualise a worldin which there is a complete defeat of the Allies, expressing as they do theideals for which the Forces of Light have ever stood. I would remind you of twothings: First, that these Forces were defeated in the earlier phase of theconflict thousands of years ago, and secondly that—if They again go down todefeat—it will be largely due to the unpreparedness and to the pacific attitudeof the neutrals of the world. Had the Allies been ready (and that in itselfwould have indicated attitudes similar to those now being expressed by Germany)and had the neutrals stood together from the outbreak of hostilities andproclaimed as one voice: This thing must not be—Germany would then have beenarrested in her triumphant progress.The Allies, however, were not prepared for the onslaught of the forces of evil;on the physical plane, their position was not impregnable. The neutrals at thesame time have chosen and are still choosing the negative and weak way; andthrough fear, a misplaced idealism, or a separative spirit, plus the failure tograsp the acuteness of the world crisis and its significant implications, haveplaced humanity in a position of imminent though not inevitable disaster. Theseare points which require careful consideration and consequent readjustment ofthe attitude of those who are doing [240] nothing to further the efforts of theForces of Light and of the men of goodwill throughout the world.What shall be done to stop the progress of aggression, of selfish nationalismand cruel attack upon the weak and the defenceless? These qualities are rampantin Germany. They are to be found in a lesser extent in many other nations andselfish nationalism is to be found in all to some degree, even whenunaccompanied by militancy or paralleled by a true idealism. It isself-interest, short vision, and prejudice that basically govern neutrality andmake the neutral nations, including the Americas, arm for defence but refuse tofight for human welfare. How, then, shall we awaken the world to the realitiesof the situation and so focus and direct a great world effort to throw off theyoke of the dictators as they seek to dominate the lands outside their own? Howshall we free humanity to take its next step forward, without fear and terrorand only conditioned by a world which is seeking unitedly to do that which isbest for the whole, and not simply that which is best materially for the part?These are the questions with which we are today confronted. Desperately andfearfully, men are seeking a solution and turning hither and thither for helpand comfort. Shall the demand, so widely prevalent at this time, for divineintervention, rise so strongly to heaven that it will perforce draw forth aresponse and, at the same time, deprive mankind of its right to settle its ownaffairs, decide its own issues and make progress by the method of trial anderror, by the success of its own clear vision and its firm determination to findthe right way out of the situation? Such intervention is possible, but it is notdeemed desirable by the Forces of spiritual knowledge. They are thereforeholding Their hand, feeling that this time humanity must be encouraged to battleto the end on behalf of its hope and its vision. Men pray for peace but will notpay the price of peace. Calmly praying and leaving the work to other men, forcesor God, is the easy way, satisfying the emotional nature, but not involvingclear thinking. Humanity has come of age; the child stage is over, and for [241]weal or woe, for good or ill, men must decide for themselves the way that theworld, their governments and their social order must go.A new world order is possible, and there are certain steps which need to betaken if the vision of this new world is to enter into the realm of accomplishedfact. Certain angles of the vision I can—with the greatest brevity—point out toyou; I can indicate the sign posts on the way to the future world order. I shallfind myself in the position of assuring you at the same time that every step ofthat way will entail a fight, the overturning of that which is old and loved andthe destruction of that which is inhuman, selfish and cruel; I shall have toimpress upon you the prime and initial necessity to overthrow the entrenchedforces of aggression as they function today through the medium of thetotalitarian powers.First, I would ask you all to ponder on the vision of this new world order,preserving an open mind and realising that this new mode of living hovers overhumanity and will materialise when selfishness is defeated, right humanrelations are correctly envisaged, and the ideal of this new world order isdivorced from all nationalistic concepts and aspirations. It will not be anAmerican world, or a French world, or a British world, or a totalitarian world.It will be the outcome of the civilisation which is passing and the culturewhich is the flower of that civilisation, but at the same time it will beneither of them. It will be a human world, based on right understanding ofcorrect human relations, upon the recognition of equal educational opportunitiesfor all men, for all races and all nations, and upon the fundamental realisationthat “God hath made of one blood all the peoples upon the earth.” It will be aworld in which racial distinctions and national unities will be recognised asenriching the whole and as contributing to the significance of humanity. Suchdistinctions and nationalities will be preserved and cultured, not in aseparative isolation, but in the realisation that the many aspects of humanunfoldment and differentiation produce one noble [242] whole, and that all theparts of this whole are interdependent. All will comprehend their relation toeach other in one progressive, synthetic, human endeavour, and the enterprise ofunited living will produce an interior work which will flower forth in theproduction of a beauty and a richness which will distinguish humanity as awhole. In this all will share, with wisdom and a planned efficiency, offering tothe planetary life and to each other that which they have to contribute. Thiswill be made possible because the whole of mankind will be recognised as theessential unit and as being of greater spiritual importance than the part.This is no idle and visionary dream. It is already happening. Embryonicmovements toward this world synthesis are already being made. There is a dreamof federation, of economic interdependence and of religious unity, plus socialand national interrelation which is rapidly taking form, first in the minds ofmen, and then in experiments. There is a tie of united purpose, felt by many inthe political and economic fields, which is no wish fulfilment or fantasy butindicative of an emerging reality. It is felt and recognised by thinkerseverywhere, and has worked out in the field of government through the medium ofthe federation of the British Dominions and their relation to Great Britain, andin the federation of the United States of America. It finds itself distorted andparodied in the concept of the superstate with which the dictators of the worldglamour their peoples. But the links are being forged which will draw down thevision and precipitate on earth the pattern of things as they should be in thisnext world cycle.When this vision of the new world order has been grasped by the men and women ofgoodwill throughout the nations, and has become part of the life and mind ofevery disciple and aspirant, then the next step will be to study the factorswhich are hindering its materialisation. For this a broad tolerance and anunprejudiced mind are essential, and these qualities are rare in the averagestudent and the small town man. Past national mistakes must be faced; [243]selfishness in the spheres of both capital and labour must be recognised;blindness, nationalistic ambitions, adherence to ancient territorial demands andassumed rights, inherited possessiveness, the refusal to relinquish past gains,disturbances in the religious and social areas of consciousness, uncertainty asto the realities of subjective and spiritual life, and the insincerities whichare based on glamour and fear—all these factors are woven into the life patternof every nation, without exception, and are exploited by the evil forces andevaded by the well-meaning but weak people of the world. These must all be seenin their true perspective. The eyes of the people who seek to work under theForces of Light must be lifted from the world of effects into the realm ofcauses; there must be appreciation of the factors which have made andconditioned the modern world, and these predisposing factors must be recognisedfor what they are. This sizing up of the situation and this recognition of blameand responsibility must preface every attempt to bring down into active beingthe new world order.This new world will not come as an answer to prayer or by the passive wishfulthinking and expectation of the peace-loving idealist and mystical visionary.They point the way and indicate the needed objective. It will come when themystic and the man of vision awakens to the need of the hour and comes down fromthe world of dreams, of theories, and of words into the hard arena of daily andpublic life. He must be willing to fight for that which he desires and knows tobe good and true and right, and must stand firm against those who seek todistort the vision and to arrest its appearance, arming for battle so that finaldisarmament may be possible.A clear vision of the future world order (in broad and general outline but notin detail), an intelligent recognition of the hindrances and impediments whichblock its appearance, and a willingness to take the necessary steps upon thephysical plane and to pay the required price and tender the demanded sacrificesare essential attitudes, prior to the elimination of the hindrances which standin the way of the [244] coming new world. It is a practical vision—long desired,much discussed and clearly outlined. The hindrances appear to be many, but theycan all be summed up in the one word Selfishness —national, racial, political,religious and individual selfishness.The practical aspect of the mode of elimination of the hindrances can also besimply stated. The vision will appear as fact on Earth when individualswillingly submerge their personal interests in the good of the group; when thegroup or groups merge their interests in the national good, when nations give uptheir selfish purposes and aims for international good, and when thisinternational right relation is based upon the total good of humanity itself.Thus the individual can play his part in the bigger whole, and his help isneeded, and thus the sense of individual futility is negated. To the mostunimportant man in the most unimportant national unit there comes the call forsacrifice and service to the group of which he is part. Eventually humanityitself is thus swung—again as an integral unit—into the service of the PlanetaryLife.In the above you have an attempt to portray the wider vision with its demanded,practical effort, and also an indication of the larger possibility which faceshumanity. It is in truth for this the Allies fight and against which Germanytoday rallies her war machine.What now of the immediate present, and what can the individual do to aid thecause of humanity and arrest the tide of evil? If he is fighting already uponthe side of the Forces of Light and of the Allies, he knows his destiny andservice. But what of those who question what they can do, and yet are eager tosee clearly and to play their part when right vision is theirs? To them I wouldsay the following things:1. Eliminate prejudice, national pride, and religious antipathies out of yourconsciousness. The past mistakes of the Allies, as history gives them, are factswhich they themselves do not deny. They stand not alone in selfishness, for[245] the same faults taint every national record. But they stand today for anew and spiritual order, based on a desire for synthesis, right methods ofgovernment and the good of the people. The unhappy past of all nations is todayused as an alibi by those who do not choose to shoulder responsibility, or tosacrifice anything for the cause of humanity. A recognition of our ownshortcomings and a spirit of tolerance and forgiveness are needed by all today.2. Refuse to be afraid of any results of right and positive action. Fear liesbehind much of the dissenting attitudes today, and fear kills truth, hides thevision and arrests right action. The great Leader of this Christian era haswarned us not to be afraid of those who kill the body, but to fear only thosewho seek to kill the soul. The forces of aggression are slowly and ruthlesslykilling out love and hope (qualities of the soul) in the conquered lands and inGermany. This, along with the great humanitarian plea, is sufficient reason toimpel all men of goodwill to take up arms on the side of the Forces of Light. Iwould commend this to your imaginative attention. To put it even morepractically, I would ask you if you would care to have your children subjectedto the educational processes of the Nazi regime—with its crushing of allhumanity, its emphasis upon pride of race and its cult of cruelty? Can you thenstand idly by or simply resort to prayer and talk about the beauties of peacewhen the little children in the appropriated lands come under the soul-killingsystem of Germany? Refuse, then, in their interests, to be afraid.3. Having sensed the vision, recognised the hindrances, and dealt with innateprejudice and fear, it will then become apparent to you what (in the face ofthis dangerous crisis) you must do. It is not for me to tell you what it is. Thedetails are for you to decide; the methods which you must employ will becomeclear to you; the humanitarian issues will become increasingly plain to you; youwill then range yourself on the side of the Forces of Light, and will uphold thehands of those who are fighting for world peace and security, preparatory to theinauguration of the new world [246] order. This you will do with no thought ofself. You will face life truly and sincerely, with a fully dedicated sacrificeof time, self, money and, if need be, of life. You will realise dynamically thatthe attitude of the passive onlooker is not that of the agent of the Forces ofLight or of a lover of humanity.4. You will also learn to keep your mind free from hate, refusing to hate thedeluded sinner even when imposing upon him the penalty of his sin. Hate andseparation must cease, and they will cease as the individual aspirant stampsthem out in his own life. The great error of the neutrally minded and of thepacifist is his refusal to identify himself constructively with human pain. Evenwhen he reacts with violent emotion over the suffering, for instance, of littlechildren in this great war, and of the defenceless refugee, he does not trulycare enough to do anything about the situation, involving as it does sacrifice.This sounds harsh, but is a needed statement of fact. Sympathy which does notproduce positive action of some kind becomes a festering sore.Thus, by thought and word and deed, the lover of humanity will enter the battleagainst evil; with complete self-forgetfulness, he will take up the cause ofhumanity, hiding not behind the sense of futility and seeking no alibi in amisinterpreted idealism. He will face the facts of the present situation in thelight which streams from the vision itself. He will then press forward into theage of right human relations, of spiritual unity and shared resources withcomplete confidence because his sense of values is adjusted. He knows thathumanity has a divine mission which must be carried out on the wings of love,through understanding action, selfless service and the willingness to die inbattle if that is the only way in which his brother can be served and freed.Having now presented the attitude towards the present world crisis which seemsto me consistent with all that I have taught in the past and in line with theteaching of the [247] Hierarchy, and having made clear the basic dualism whichunderlies this conflict, and pointed out the lines of demarcation which areclearly emerging, I now call upon all of you to stand with the Forces of Light.These are difficult and terrible days. Men and women are needed who have thecourage and the insight to stand with steadfastness and to take the steps whichare needed—no matter what they may be—to bring this war to an end. Vast sectionsof humanity can do no more than acquiesce in the unhappy fate which hasovertaken them. They are unable to think or pray or even to summon faith totheir aid. They feel without hope. For them, you must think; for them, you mustpray; for them, you must have faith and—above all else at this time—for them youmust act. The work of reconstruction lies in the future. The demand today is forthe building of a bulwark of defence around humanity; then—having fulfilledevery physical plane requirement—to stand immovable. But you must stand withfaces turned towards the enemy of the souls of men, ready to do battle,literally and physically, ready to take every needed step to drive the enemyback, and ready to sacrifice to the uttermost so that he may advance no further.Your work will, therefore, be of a threefold nature. On the levels of mentalconsciousness, your vision of the need and of the future will be clear,inspiring you and enabling you to be a source of strength to all around you;your faith will see behind the obvious to the “substance of things hoped for,the evidence of things not seen,” as the initiate, Paul, expresses it; yourthought will then be anchored in right action, soul directed. On the emotionalside of life, you will find no time for idle tears or for vague, sympathetictalk, because you will be completely identified with what is going on and allemotional energy will be directed to the pursuit of every available mode ofpractically alleviating the pain. The heart energy will be occupied with thetask of giving understanding help so that there is no scope for the usualemotional solar plexus reactions. On the physical plane you will not be occupiedwith the problem of what to do, [248] because every physical effort, time, andpersonality emphasis will be directed to the shouldering of your due share inarresting the forces of aggression from any further advance. This might meanfighting in the ranks of the Allied Armies, or it might mean driving anambulance under Red Cross auspices; raising funds to succour the refugees;speaking on public platforms or to groups upon the issues at stake, orparticipating in some form of national effort to bring aid and strength to theAllies. Whatever it is, it will call for all that is in you and all that youare, integrated and directed to a sustained, substantial, one-pointed effort.It will throw your will-to-good behind every attempt to frustrate the activitiesof the evil alliance which you may find in your environment; it will lead you towork with watchfulness for the good of your own country, whilst at the same timeswelling the tide of the national effort to end war through the tangible victoryof the Forces of Light. Ponder on these words.The goodwill effort of the world, which I sought earlier to inaugurate and tosynthesise, has passed through a negative stage and through an interlude whereinit was not possible to work actively. The needs of the New Group of WorldServers calls it now into a renewed positive activity. The rediscovery and theimmediate sustaining of the members of this group must be undertaken anew. Inall lands they must be reached, if possible, and rehabilitated with wisdom, andre-established subjectively. They must be aided objectively and again inspiredto work in order that they may form the nucleus of the Forces of Reconstructionwhen the Forces of Light have won the victory over the forces of aggression.This is the first point which I would ask you to consider doing.The second thing is to begin the dynamic use of another Stanza of the GreatInvocation. That which you have hitherto used has now served its immediatepurpose, though it can again be called into use after the war is over. I giveyou now another set of phrases which can (if rightly used) invoke the Forces ofthe Divine Will on to the side of the [249] Forces of Light. It is not easy togive an adequate translation or paraphrase of this power-mantram, nor is it easyto step it down sufficiently so that it can be safely used by all, yet at thesame time preserve its challenging, dynamic quality. The following sentenceswill suffice, however, and if used by you with focussed intention and with theattitude of a sacrificial personality (held silently dedicated in the light ofthe soul), much power may be generated. Along the lines of power which you maythus succeed in setting up may come that which is needed to release humanityfrom the thraldom of evil, provided the nature of the sacrificial will issomewhat understood by you.Let the Lords of Liberation issue forth.Let Them bring succour to the sons of men.Let the Rider from the secret Place come forth,And coming, save.Come forth, O Mighty One.~Let the souls of men awaken to the Light,And may they stand with massed intent.Let the fiat of the Lord go forth:The end of woe has come!Come forth, O Mighty One.The hour of service of the Saving Force has now arrived.Let it be spread abroad, O Mighty One.~Let Light and Love and Power and DeathFulfil the purpose of the Coming One.The Will to save is here,The Love to carry forth the work is widely spread abroad.The Active Aid of all who know the truth is also here.Come forth, O Mighty One and blend these three.Construct a great defending wall.The rule of evil now must end.If, therefore, you will say these three stanzas with a focussed affirmativewill, a great potency may be released for [250] the salvaging of humanity andthe immediate defeat of the forces of aggression. But I would reiterate that theuse of these words must be accompanied by the dedication of your personalitylife to the cause of humanity, and by the transmutation of your personal willinto the sacrificial will of the soul.Finally, I would ask you to get in touch as soon as you can with theheadquarters of the goodwill work and indicate also your willingness tocooperate to the fullest extent with the Forces of Light. This will servepractically to focus your effort. I would ask you also to make it possible todisseminate this article on the widest scale that is possible, so that the useof the new Invocation may be widespread. There are many to whom it could besent, and it would arouse them anew to fresh activity and hopeful effort. Iwould ask you to use this new Invocation with faith, for it blends into amagnetic unity the forces of the divine Will-to-Good, the Love which underliesthe efforts of the Hierarchy, and the Intelligent Activity of humanity, thuscreating a reservoir of power into which the energy of the three divine centrescan pour and upon which the Forces of Light can draw. The saying of thisInvocation is not a substitute for the physical plane effort on your part; it iscomplementary to that, and the more you are serving upon the physical plane, themore effective will be your use of the new Invocation.I said earlier that the war could have been averted from expression on thephysical plane had the disciples and aspirants of the world measured up to theiropportunity and responsibilities. The Great Invocation was rendered relativelypowerless, from the angle of dynamic usefulness, because the majority of thosewho used it turned it into a peace prayer. It was instead a great spirituallymilitant invocative demand. This must not happen with this Stanza of Invocation.It is a demand; it is also an authoritative affirmation of existent fact; itsets in motion agencies and forces hitherto quiescent, and these can change theface of the world battlefield; it invokes the Prince of Peace, but He [251]carries a sword, and the effects of His activity may prove surprising to thosewho see only the needs of the form aspect of humanity.That strength and enlightenment may be yours and the power to stand and theability to fight for the release of humanity is the prayer and the appeal ofyour brother, the Tibetan.~THE GREAT INVOCATIONStanza TwoSeptember 1940It has seemed to me after due thought that it would serve a most useful purposeif I elucidated somewhat the theme of the new Invocation and dealt also with theidea of divine intervention. There is much loose thinking in this connection,due to the truth as well as the misinterpretation of the Christian teachinganent the return of the Christ. Men’s theological, analytical minds havedistorted God’s revelation, and I would like to do something to produce a wiserattitude to the reality of this inevitable return. This loose thinking preventsmuch intelligent and cooperative work. I would remind you that the success ofinvocation and the true efficacy of prayer are dependent upon clear thinking andnot upon emotional desire or a powerful wish complex. They are dependent, too,upon a certain dynamic freshness and enthusiasm which it is hard to attain in atime of stress and strain. The present time is peculiarly hard. Perhaps aclearer understanding of the nature and purpose of divine intervention mayclarify somewhat the issue.To the casual thinker and the untrained occult student it might appearthat—given an almighty Deity or Planetary Logos—He could with little trouble andmuch usefulness and compassion intervene in this sad world situation and bringto an end the warring of the nations through the medium of some spectacularhappening, some dramatic cataclysm of natural process or some supreme appearingwhich [252] would work much good. It might, it could be argued, conclusivelyconvince the attacking, aggressive groups that their day is ended and that theirefforts had better be drawn to an immediate finish. Would that it were sorelatively simple a matter; but the laws of nature, the free will of humanityitself and the inevitability of karma combine to prevent an intervention in justthese terms. This does not mean that some form of intervention may not bepossible but it must conform to law; it must not interfere with humanity’s rightto handle its own affairs, and it must be timed in such a way that the best andmaximum results can be attained.I would like first of all to touch upon the three points which I have madeabove—natural law, free will and karma. In so doing I may succeed in clearing upsome of the confused thinking of many students.Natural law is the inevitable working out upon the physical plane of forces andenergies which have long been generated. People are apt to think that these mustlie outside of human control and constitute part of the inscrutable will of God,and that with them man has naught to do. When it is realised that certainaspects of natural law are concerned purely with the forces—subterranean,superficial and aerial—of our planet, the premise will be seen as correct in thepresent condition of the mental attitudes of the race and will remain so for avery long time. There are, nevertheless, causes and effects which can come underthe category of natural law which are yet not so far removed from human control.For ages man has generated energies which must inevitably produce events uponthe physical plane, evoke response upon the plane of the emotions, and inducemental reactions. It is here that natural law and the law of karma meet andinteract upon each other.There are many people today who find an alibi for themselves in the presentworld situation, and a consequent release from definite action andresponsibility, by saying that what is today happening is simply karma or theworking out of cause and effect, and that there is nothing, therefore, that theycan do about it; they take the position that [253] it is not their affair, andthat in due course of time the process will be worked out and everything will beall right again. The slate will then be cleaner and incidentally they will nothave been embroiled, but will have safely (even if uncomfortably) looked on. Inso doing they overlook the third aspect of this same law, to which we have giventhe name of free will. It is the right use of free will and its understandingexpression which must eventually straighten out and adjust the working out ofkarma and transmute that which now works such evil and havoc in the world into ademonstration of good and of the successful foundation for the pursuit of truehappiness. Therefore, those who are looking on at the tragic sufferings ofhumanity and who refuse to be implicated, and thus succeed in evadingresponsibility as an integral part of the human family, are definitely storingup for themselves much evil karma. In some way they must learn participation,because the present situation has in it the seeds of release for humanity whenthe nature of evil is somewhat grasped, and above all when the oneness ofhumanity and the rights of human beings are truly recognised. Those who waragainst the race of men and who seek to wrest from them their God-given goal offreedom must be driven back from whence they came. Those who refuse to share inthat struggle for freedom will be left out of the gains of freedom, even if itonly means within their own home limits, in their life habits and in theirprivate circumstances. When I here speak of “being driven back from whence theycame” I am using phrases in both the simple and the occult sense.It is therefore the free will and the will-to-good of humanity which mustactively end the present conflict. One of these, the first, concerns man’sresponsibility to man; the other, rightly understood, concerns the rightrelationship of man to divine purpose, his right orientation to the divinegoodwill, and his correct participation in its expression. Where theseconditions exist, there can be drawn forth an act of divine intervention.Natural law is today producing great changes in nature [254] through the effectsof aerial and physical combat, through the results of the fluid movement ofwhole sections of the world population and through the effects of vast economicchanges and processes. Conditions have been set in motion which must now workout to their predestined end, and it is the task of those who guide humanityspiritually to see that out of the surface evil and material activity good mayeventuate, and that out of the wicked, materialistic intent lying behind thepresent aggressive activity of certain groups ultimate good may be engineeredand the evil activity ended. But this possible good will be the result of thespiritual activity of those who know the law and who understand the purpose ofthe will of God; it will be wrought out in spite of, and not because of, thebrute force and the selfish goals of the world aggressors; these embody andensoul the materialistic forces of the planet in a manner utterly new inexpression.Free will involves a basic understanding of the lines of world cleavage; itconcerns right choice and consequent correct action for the group and isdetermined every time by that which is right for the whole and not so much bythat which is right for the part. Humanity is only now reaching the point wherefree will can be of significant importance. There has been little free will todate. This is definitely the needed demonstration at this moment. It is the lackof true free will which is today holding up the final activity. This is astatement of importance and it is here that the great and free neutrals can givea right lead to human affairs. Aggression, fear, terror, foreboding and thenumbness that comes from undue and ceaseless mental and physical pain arestultifying and negating free will in many sections of the world at this time.There is no free will in many parts of Europe today.Prejudice, the misinterpretation of presented facts, false and overemphasisedidealism, racial and nationalistic thoughtforms and the withdrawing fear ofresponsibility are hindering the expression of free will in the less damagedparts of the world. Moral unpreparedness and the [255] refusal to relinquish themany and differing misinterpretations of truth or of Christ’s teaching arehindering many people today. Release for humanity will come when the so-calledgood people of the world give up their pet theories and their beloved ideals andgrasp the essential fact that entry into the Kingdom of Heaven and into the newage will take place when mankind is truly loved and selflessly served, and whenthe true, divine purpose is seen and humanity is found to be one indivisiblewhole. Then petty nationalisms, religious differences and selfish idealisms (forthat is what they often are as most people are idealists because they seek tosave their own souls) are subordinated to human need, human good and the futurehappiness of the whole. The simplification of the attitude of men is the cryingneed at this time. Ideologies must go; old ideals must be relinquished; pettypolitical, religious and social schemes must be discarded, and the one drivingpurpose and the one outstanding determination must be the release of humanityfrom the imposition of fear, from enforced slavery and the reinstatement of menin freedom and with due opportunity to express themselves through right humanrelations. This is not as yet possible and it is the appalling situation ofterror, of slavery and of imposed and penalising rule which is breaking theheart of humanity and causing deep distress and questioning in those whosehearts are not yet so broken.As to Karma , what man has made he can unmake. This is oft forgotten. Karma isnot a hard and fast rule. It is changeable, according to man’s attitude anddesire. It is the presenting of the opportunity to change; this grows out ofpast activities, and these rightly met and correctly handled lay the foundationfor future happiness and progress. The present situation is the fault of allpeoples in all countries (particularly the more intelligent) and includes alsothe great neutrals if the Law of Rebirth and of joint responsibility meansanything at all. Karma is not all that is bad and evil. Men make it so throughtheir stupidities. There are today great forces of evil seeking expression inthe world; [256] these emerge out of the past and seek to determine and bringabout a very evil future wherein selfishness, material objectives, and the goodand well-being of one race out of the many must be imposed upon the world—aworld which innately revolts against such an imposition and distortion ofreality. The force of evil example is shown in the fact that two other racesseek abjectly to copy or aid the forces of aggression, focussed at this timethrough the aggressor race.At the same time, the forces of good are seeking to offset this imposition ofmaterial selfishness and are now at bay with the issue still undecided—exceptupon the mental plane. It has yet to work out as the triumph of good upon thephysical plane. When those who are not so drastically implicated in the presentconflict relinquish their selfishness, their prejudices and theirinterpretations and see the basic duality of this conflict in its true light,they will throw the weight of their influence increasingly on the side ofgoodwill and right human relations; then the bad karma which they apparentlyplacidly accept for others and reject for themselves will be changed into thegood karma which is the true destiny of humanity and will usher in the new eraof joy and of peace and spiritual synthesis—that synthesis which we callbrotherhood.It is because of the delay in right understanding, and the slowness of many toappreciate the true situation, that Those Who guide the race and work on thespiritual side of life have been unable to do much up to date except spirituallystrengthen the hands of the workers with the Forces of Light. The faith of manyhas kept the door ajar, yet even these have forgotten frequently that “faithwithout works is dead.” It is only when faith finds active expression upon thephysical plane in right cooperation and sacrifice (even unto death) that thedoor can be forced wide open and divine intervention become possible. It is onlywhen the vision and dream of peace—which beguiles so many well-meaningpeople—gives way to the determination to take every possible means to achievethat peace in practical [257] ways upon the physical plane that the innerspiritual forces will be enabled to work also more actively on earth.Curiously enough, they are often hindered today by the idealists, who love theirideals more than they love humanity and who cling to their specialinterpretations of what they think Christ meant, at the same time excluding thatreal love which characterised His every act and which would drive them intoactive, selfless service to the Forces of Light. They do nothing to bring theconflict to an end because they are preoccupied with their own dreams, idealsand interpretations; when they can let these go because of love of humanity,then the new vision will come and the world will be saved; the Forces of Lightwill find potent expression and the forces of aggression will go down to defeat.Given, therefore, an eventual fusing of vision and physical plane activity (themajor need at this time), what form is it possible for the hoped-for divineintervention to take? I make no prophecies. All that I seek to show is that theblocking or hindrance is to be found today on the side of humanity. It does notlie on the side of the forces of light, life and love; it is not to be found onthe side of Christ and His disciples or of the Masters of Wisdom, as these(under diverse names) constitute the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet. CallThem by what name you choose, the most cherished belief of humanity is thatthere exists in the world always and for ever a hidden Reality, Those Who haveconquered death, Who possess illimitable powers to help, and Who can be reachedby prayer and invocation.It is the potency and grasp of things material and the fact of undivided focusupon the physical plane that has given the forces of aggression so much successup to the present time. These forces, through their very potency, have fused andblended together a group of seven men who personify in themselves great andspecific aspects of material forces (connected with the seven types of energy intheir lowest and most material expressions) and their manifestations—war, fearand cruelty. They are united by one point [258] of view and by one goal, andhence their success. (It is interesting that, again in their case, there appearsinevitably an initiatory seven—the base and dark parallel of the initiatingSeven who lead human beings into light and who are symbolised in the sevenMasons who constitute a Lodge of Masons.) They are the custodians of forceswhich control them and over which they themselves have no slightest control. Youask who these seven are: Hitler, von Ribbentrop, Goebbels, Goering, Hess,Himmler and Streicher—names well-known to you all. These men embody andpersonify the forces of aggression and rule by fear not only the enslavednations but also their few allies who are not by any means in the same categoryof power—fortunately for them.When those who are on the side of the Forces of Light and of non-aggression cansee their goal with equal clarity and are equally and uniformly united with theobjective of ending oppression and slavery and of freeing humanity, then weshall see also an embodiment of spiritual force which will bring disaster tothese potent seven. Such a unification of objective and of purpose is possibleand needed; and when it does take place, the force generated and the power letloose upon the physical plane will be of so stupendous a nature that humanliberation will rapidly be brought about.It is for this that I have worked and for this I have sought to arouse all ofyou. This spirit is growing among the allied forces, though the falling away ofFrance was inevitable. France was animated by somewhat selfish purposes—thesecurity and safety of France more than with the integrity and happiness ofhumanity, and this led to an inevitable collapse; France is learning, however,and its unshakable masses and its spiritual nucleus will save the day for thebroken nation. The neutral powers are still selfish (though they seek byphilanthropy to veil it), but they are rapidly awakening to the true issues, andwhen there is real synthesis of goal and of purpose and a true unification ofvision upon the mental plane, of fixed and unalterable desire upon the emotionalplane, and a dedication to practical effort [259] upon the physical plane, thenthere will be hope that the embodiment of “the desire of all nations” willappear.That embodiment is one mode in which divine intervention can take place. ThePrince of Peace will lead His people—through war—to peace. Those who think onlyin terms of peace as they understand it and desire it are apt to forget theBiblical implication that the Prince of Peace takes a definite part in thebattle of Armageddon (now in full progress). After achieving victory, He willthen lead His triumphant cohorts through the gates into “Jerusalem,” the city ofpeace. The symbolic and practical significance of this is becoming increasinglyapparent. This notable event can and will take place when the free will of thepeople, blended by invocation and prayer, can make this possible.Divine intervention could also take the form of a cataclysmic happening whichwould bring aggression to an end through destruction. It would probably be atsuch a cost of human life that there is definite hesitation over employing it bythe custodians of natural law and the workers who understand divine purpose,apart from the fact that humanity has now reached the point in evolution wherethe expression of human free will is definitely possible. The use of cataclysmwas the method employed in Atlantean days, as you well know from the tales ofthe flood; and through the flood there was almost complete destruction of thecivilisation of that time. It is hoped that such a drastic step will not beneeded today, though there are ancient prophecies which foretell the possibilityof the destruction of this world at this time through fire—instead of flood.Which of the two methods—divine embodiment and natural cataclysm—will beemployed will really be decided by humanity through its use or non-use of freewill and understanding. If humanity fails to unite under the banner of theForces of Light against the forces of material aggression and selfishness, thenthe “fiery ordeal” might be unavoidable.There are also sleeping hosts which may be evoked for the aiding of thespiritual forces, and certain ancient prophecies hint at these, but as we studythe new Invocation phrase [260] by phrase, I may be able to make this matterclearer, for there are several significances and meanings behind each phrase.The one thing I seek to make clear in these opening remarks is that natural law,free will, and karma are becoming increasingly related and are all aspects ofone great law, embodying divine purpose—a purpose which must work out throughthe medium of humanity itself if the present opportunity is to be met correctlyand in line with divine purpose.The stimulation of certain people to phenomenal action, and the instigation ofothers to emerge as dynamic and inspired leaders, is also another way in whichdivine intervention might find expression. Oft, down the ages, men have beenovershadowed by divinity and inspired by God to accept positive leadership, andso make divine purpose a fact in conditioning world affairs. Had they not soresponded to the influencing impression, and had they not accepted theresponsibility imposed upon them, the course of world affairs and world eventsmight have been very different. I refer not here specifically to spiritualleaders but also to leaders in other departments of human living—to suchexpressions of the divine will as Moses, the Lawgiver, Akbar, the warrior andstudent, Leonardo da Vinci, the inspired artist, and to other great andoutstanding figures who have determined the basic trends of human civilisation;I refer also to the constructive forces which have guided mankind into theincreasing light of knowledge and understanding. All these leaders have producedlasting effects upon the human consciousness and their work has lain thereforein the domain of the second aspect of divinity. Their activities parallel thoseof the workers who are, or have been, inspired by the material or matter aspectof manifestation, whose influence has been predominantly upon the physicalplane, and whose effect has been outstandingly along selfish personal lines.This type of influence is felt predominantly upon the physical plane, andtherefore, from certain angles, the present conflict might be regarded as onebetween the second aspect, the developed spiritual consciousness, and thematerial aspect of [261] manifestation, with humanity constituting the greatfield of divine conflict at this time.We have, therefore, hinted at the following forms of divine intervention:1. Divine embodiments2. Natural cataclysms3. Evocation of slumbering Entities4. Emergence of inspired leadership.There still remains one mode of intervention which is still more mysterious,illimitably more powerful, and definitely more difficult both to evoke andsubsequently to contact. This is the emergence, response, or appearing of greatSons of God Who dwell in sources far removed from our planetary life altogether;this involves the appearance of Lives of such stupendous and divine expressionand potency that only the massed spiritual purpose of vast numbers of men can bepotent enough and far-reaching enough to pierce beyond the veil which protectsthe Earth, to those far distant realms where They have Their natural andeverlasting abode. They cannot be reached by prayer or even by well formulateddesire—the expression of the wish life of the masses. They lie utterly beyondthe realm of feeling (as humanity understands it) and dwell ever in that highplace which can only be reached by intentionally directed, selfless thought.Are there enough people in the world today whose focussed and illumined thoughtcan be organised and directed towards these Lives in such a manner that They canbe attracted and led to respond to human need for deliverance? Such is theproblem. It is possible, but not, perhaps, probable. The problem of a blendeddemand from the spiritual Hierarchy and from humanity—simultaneouslyexpressed—will have to be met, and this is by no means easy of accomplishment.It is for this reason that these three stanzas from a very ancient invocationhave been made available and put in your hands at this time. If you can usethese phrases as voiced demands and affirmed beliefs —in unison with the [262]highest spiritual forces which claim your allegiance, no matter under whatname—then there is just a chance that this type of divine activity might be setin motion along a particular line, and this might lead to changes of soauspicious a nature that a new heaven and a new earth might be rapidlyprecipitated. There is at least no harm in this attempt and this effort atparticipation in hierarchical endeavour. Planned collaboration with the work ofthe Christ at this time is useful and needed; it will serve at least to elevatehumanity and its thought, and produce a permanent spiritual stabilisation. Greatpotencies and the expression of ancient evil from the past are rampant uponearth at this time, released through unusual human selfishness, cruelty anderror, and focussed through the medium of one unhappy race and the power ofcertain dangerous men—men who are easily subject to evil impression andinfluenced, obsessed, by selfishness and evil—by forces of destruction. Is itpossible to evoke at this time eternal good, latent in Lives which wouldnormally contact humanity in some far distant future, and thus hasten the day ofheightened and deepened spiritual contact in the immediate present? Such is thequestion. If this can be done, the evil past and the glorious future may perhapsbe brought into contact in the unhappy present, and an event take place whichwill produce stupendous changes.I would remind you here that the evocation of this divine contact will be, initself, dangerous, disrupting and destroying. The results are unpredictable forthe human being, for men are as yet unaccustomed to respond to Lives andInfluences of so high and divine a nature. There is nevertheless a possibilitythat it might now be more safely permitted if enough people can stand togetherspiritually and selflessly, and so offer themselves as channels for these newand unknown spiritual Forces. There are divine attributes, divine qualities anddivine potencies which the most enlightened humanity of all time have as yetfailed even to register, sense or vision—all three aspects escaping contact withthese potencies. Yet these powers exist, and the right [263] handling of thepresent crisis by spiritually oriented humanity may bring about the release ofsome of these higher energies and the establishing of a line of factualinfluence along which They can move and consequently contact the Earth. Ponderon this and limit not Deity through the rigidity and finiteness of little minds.The release of great impersonal forces is ever a critical matter. The effectsproduced are dependent upon the quality of the recipient aspects and the natureof the form quality upon which they make their impact. In the world ofchemistry, a catalyst, brought into contact with certain substances, willproduce something entirely new and bring about changes not normally anticipated.These we are now beginning to study and to understand. The intervention into thesituation of certain potencies of stupendous gravity and uniqueness, and theireffect upon the interacting Forces of Light and forces of aggression, is stillmore unpredictable, and only the grasp of the spiritually minded people of theworld and their steadfastness in sacrifice—plus their clarity of vision andtheir united world focus—can make the situation safe for humanity as a whole.Bear these thoughts in mind as you use the great and new Invocation.One other thought I would like to touch upon prior to an analysis of the phrasesof the Invocation.It is a recognized truth today that all expression upon the physical plane isthe result, first of all, of thought, then of desire, and finally of physicalplane activity. A man sees a vision and a possibility. He broods over it and itenters then into the realm of mental invention. A thoughtform is then organised,whether it is the thoughtform of a sewing machine, of a political party, of aneconomic idea, or some other type of organisation with some planned objective.Much reflection and brooding will eventually produce a magnetic field which willbecome so potent that desire will enter in; then the dream or vision enters intoa new stage of vitalisation. In due time, when the processes of desire haveadequately developed, the vision will precipitate upon the physical plane.Physical activity and concrete methods [264] of manifestation are thencoordinated and gradually the thoughtform becomes an expressed reality,recognisable by all men.Thought, desire, activity—such is the history of human vision and dream. Downthe ages, from the very night of time, man has dreamed, expectant of divinerevelation and of divine intervention. When all else seems to fail, men look toGod. Again and again in the history of the race, the vision has taken form andthe dream has materialised upon the wings of powerful desire and demand. Againand again, God has revealed and sent His Messengers and Representatives to aidand guide humanity. But this happens only when the demand is adequately voicedand the need has cried to high heaven. Never yet has the response failed. Againand again lately, the nations of the world have been called to prayer, and thisproclaimed appeal of millions cannot be disregarded or remain negligible. Ananswer must be forthcoming, though it may not take the same form as of old,because man is today—in spite of appearances—more capable of handling his ownaffairs and determining consciously his own events. No matter how unrealised,back of all these demands and prayers in the many Christian countries, lies asubtle, deep-seated conviction that the return of Christ is imminent; there iswidespread acceptance of the concept that the Presence of the Son of God can beevoked and that He must come to the assistance of His people. No matter what thedogmatic interpretation or the theological idealism, some form of this belieflies behind the cry of the millions.Will this demand from the hearts of men induce the return of the Christ ofGalilee? Will it bring about the emergence into manifestation of some great Sonof God Who will embody perhaps another and unknown aspect of God’s life andquality? Will it perhaps produce the embodiment of another divine revelation,and—just as the Buddha expressed the Wisdom of God and Christ revealed to us theLove of God—is it not possible that He Who may come will unfold to us the natureof the Will or Purpose of God, thus presenting that will-to-good which must becalled into [265] activity if the evil will-to-power is to be swept from theEarth. I present this possibility to your attention and would ask you to thinkabout it. Thus, if this should prove the correct result of all invocation andprayer, we shall have the balancing of the personality will, of materialselfishness and acquisitiveness, and the selfless will which seeks to aid thewhole of humanity. The will of the lower self and the will of the Self or Soulwill be brought into conflict with each other, with humanity throwing the weightof its influence upon one side or the other.When I speak of throwing the weight of human influence upon one side or another,I refer not alone to thought power and to what so many euphemistically call“work on mental levels.” I refer to the conscious activity of the whole man,working mentally, emotionally and most emphatically physically also. Only those,therefore, who are integrated personalities can work in this manner, and hereinlies a difficulty. Those people today who work only mentally or who sit and sendthoughts of love broadcast into the world, and who bask thus in the beauty oftheir own idealism (making frequently no adequate balancing physical effort tobring this present evil situation to an end through right choice, sacrifice andstrenuous service), are in reality of no service at all to any exceptthemselves. There are those who send thoughts of love to the group of evil menwho are responsible for world disaster, believing thereby to influence them forgood. I would remind them that love is essentially an impersonal potency orenergy, dependent for its effect upon the type of form which it contacts andupon which it makes an impact. Pouring, therefore, upon the selfishmaterialistic nature, it will only enhance desire and promote increasedacquisitive aggression, and thus foster the lower nature and distort the trueexpression of love, leading to increased evil activity. Pouring upon theselfless, the pure and the disinterested, it will foster reality and true love.These are points which should be remembered at this time by the well-intentionedbut occultly ignorant server.[266] Let us now proceed to the analysis of the three stanzas or verses. Thefirst of these refers to the waiting attentive group of spiritual Lives who seekto aid when right demand coincides with right time. The second stanza refers tohumanity and its reactions, and to the possibility of interplay between the twogroups—of spiritual Lives and men. The third indicates methods and results. Wewill take each phrase or expressed idea separately, for each carries its ownimport and all of them possess several significances. With all the meanings Icannot deal, but will present the simplest and the most important.Let the Lords of Liberation issue forth. Let Them bring succour to the sons ofmen.Who are the Lords of Liberation, and from whence do They come? All the ideas andconcepts which control human life and have given rise to our civilisation havestarted as emanations from certain great Lives, Who are Themselves an expressionof a divine Idea. The note They strike and the quality They emanate reaches outand makes an impact upon the most developed of the sons of men found at anyparticular time upon the Earth. These then proceed to make the sensed idea theirown and to familiarise the thinkers of their time with the formulated concept.In this way great motivating, divine purposes become controlling factors inhuman progress. It is in this way that the basic urge to liberation and tofreedom has slowly and consistently dominated human endeavour, leading first ofall to the struggle for individual freedom and liberation (with the incidentalideal of heaven, of initiation and of spiritual attainment), and graduallymoulding human thought to such an extent that the greater ideal takes shape. Thefreedom of humanity and the liberation of its power to be self-determining(which is an aspect of freedom) has become the dearest ideal and the bestthought of the thinkers in all nations. In the last analysis, it is thisinterference with individual and group freedom which is the worst sin of theevil men who seek at this time to enslave the weaker nations and bend them tothe rule of Germany, depriving them of [267] their national assets and means ofsubsistence, and wresting from them—by force and fear—their dearest possessions,liberty of life and conscience.All great ideas have their emanating Sources of life, therefore, and These arecalled in the ancient invocation with which we are occupied “Lords ofLiberation.” They are three in number, and one of Them is closer to the Earthand to humanity than are the other two, and it is He Who can be reached by thosewho comprehend the nature of freedom and who desire beyond all things to beliberated and to see all the oppressed and enslaved people of the world alsoliberated.Every move of an enlightened consciousness (such as that of a Lord ofLiberation) towards humanity produces a corresponding shift or move on the partof men. This in itself constitutes a definite problem, because no such move canbe made by a Lord of Liberation unless humanity is ready to raise its ideal offreedom to a higher level of expression. Unless this world war has in it theseeds of a revelation of a higher human freedom, and unless humanity is ready toexpress this higher freedom to the best of its ability, it will not be possiblefor the Lords of Liberation to take action. They cannot be moved by prayer,demand and invocation alone. Such demand must have behind it the ideal of anewer freedom and a greater liberty for man. In the abrogation of the Frenchidealism, summed up in the words—”Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”—the attentionof the whole world was focussed on the theme of liberty, and the symbolism ofthe event is of far greater import than has yet been grasped. France has notrelinquished the ideal of human liberty which she originally brought (on a largescale) to the attention of mankind. Her action, under the influence of theenemies of human freedom, simply focussed the danger with which humanity wasconfronted, and brought it emphatically to the attention of humanity, numbed bydisaster, and bewildered by the accumulated weight of misery. By so doing, theproblem was simplified for the untrained mind. It also produced, spirituallyspeaking, a direct line of [268] communication between men who know thesignificance of freedom and long for human release, and the Lords of LiberationWho are responsible for implanting this innate desire in humanity.The reason why these Lords of Liberation are the first mentioned in the stanzais that They are essentially related to desire-will, and are therefore the moreeasily contacted by man. The place from which They issue forth to the aiding ofhumanity is a certain area of the divine Consciousness which is open to thehuman sense of awareness, if sufficiently enlightened and selfless. You can seefrom the above remark how the effective use of invocation is therefore dependentupon the point of spiritual development of the one who seeks the aid of trueprayer and invocation. One thing which should be grasped anent all these greatLives is that what is commonly called “worship” is abhorred by Them. Worship,the power to adore and the sense of awe (which is one of the highest aspects offear) are not desired by Them. Such attitudes are emotional in origin and basedupon the sense of duality, and therefore upon feeling. These Lives areembodiments of service and can be reached by true servers with the appeal ofservice. Bear this in mind. As man progresses upon the Path he forgets worship;he loses all sense of fear, and adoration fails to engross his attention. Allthese attitudes are obliterated by the realisation of an overpowering love andits consequent interplay and tendency to increase identification. The Lords ofLiberation can be reached, therefore, by the call of the world servers, and Theywill then issue forth through the agency of One of Them, Who will unify theenergies of all Three, and so produce those conditions which will bring abouteffective and recognised freedom. How They will do this is not for us to say;the most probable method will be through the overshadowing of some man, or somegroup of men, so that they will be inspired to bring about the victory ofliberty.Let the Rider from the secret place come forth and coming—save. Come forth, OMighty One.Here we come up against one of the oldest traditions [269] in the world and ofthe ancient East; one, too, which finds its counterpart in the New Testament,where the Coming One is seen coming forth to the rescue of the people “ridingupon a white horse.” In the Occident we have for long thought in terms of the“Lamb, slain from the foundations of the world,” and in this statement lies aprofound astrological truth. It refers to that great round of the zodiac (aperiod of approximately 25,000 years) in which the sun passes through all thetwelve signs of the zodiac. The period to which reference is made started in thesign Aries, the Ram. The Orient, however, harks still further back, to a muchearlier period and to a still more ancient date, remote in the night of time,when the greater world cycle started in the sign Sagittarius, the Archer. Thesymbol of this is sometimes (towards the latter part of the cycle) depicted asan archer, riding on a horse and (in the early part of the cycle) as a centaur,half man and half horse. Both refer to an emerging revelation of theconsciousness of Deity as revealed through some Great Divine Expression, throughsome manifesting Son of God. The point to bear in mind is that this Rider on thewhite horse is no extra-planetary Entity or Life, but is essentially One likeunto ourselves—human and animal combined as are we all, but fused with divinityand inspired from on high, informed by some cosmic and divine Principle, asChrist was informed with the Love of God and carried the revelation of love toman. The Rider is one of our humanity Who has reached a pre-destined goal andWho—for very love and understanding of man—has remained for ages in the secretplace of revelation (as it is esoterically called), waiting until His hour comesaround again and He can then issue forth to lead His people to triumphantvictory. This coming One is on the Path of a world Saviour just as the morepotent Lives, the Lords of Liberation, are on the Path of world Service. Theyissue forth via that highest spiritual centre wherein the Will of God is held insolution or custody, for gradual release or revelation as humanity can arrive atthe needed point of understanding response and receptivity. Though They can[270] be reached relatively easily, it must be through the massed intent of themany focussed minds. The Rider on the white horse can be reached by theindividual aspirant if he can raise his consciousness adequately high. ThisRider comes forth (from the centre wherein the Love of God is held fordistribution) as the human centre (which we call humanity) becomes attuned totrue love and can identify itself with all men, responding freely and withoutany inhibition to divine Love—which is wisdom, understanding, and effective,skilful activity.When this invocation is rightly used and voiced by an adequate number of people,those who can in some measure employ the enlightened will may succeed inreaching the Lords of Liberation and produce, as a result, a phenomenalintervention of some kind. Those who work more emotionally will reach the Riderfrom the secret place and may bring Him forth to save and lead the masses ofpeople. Are there enough focussed minds and intense attentive hearts to reachthe two centres where wait Those Who can aid at this time? That is the question.It will happen when the three centres—humanity, the spiritual Hierarchy of theplanet, and the “place where the will of God lies hidden” (called in the ancientscriptures Shamballa)—are aligned and en rapport with each other. There willthen be established a direct relation between all three, and a direct channelfor the inflow of liberating force. This has happened only once before in thehistory of the race.Owing to the fact that mankind is so weakened by pain, strain and suffering, theprobability is that it will not be deemed wise for the Lords of Liberationdirectly to contact humanity. They will more probably do three things:1. Stand behind and strengthen the Rider on the white horse as He responds tothe demand of the people everywhere, pouring through Him that dynamic energywhich embodies the first divine aspect, the will aspect, the power expression.Thus They will enable Him to carry out the will of God in such a manner thathumanity can grasp [271] what is being done. Mankind will then see the Lovewhich animates the Will and Power of God. The true significance of liberty willthen be revealed. It is not yet understood.2. Pour Their strengthening will-to-good into the New Group of World Servers inall lands, so that there may be potent, simultaneous action in line with thepurposes of the Rider from the secret place.3. Stimulate and integrate into the minds of certain advanced disciples a numberof new ideals which must govern the liberating process and find expression inthe New Age. This was done in a small way at the time of the French Revolutionwhen the three major concepts of freedom were expressed in the three words,Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and were intellectually presented to the race.These have now been temporarily relinquished, and this in itself constitutes animportant symbolic happening. It had to occur, because these three words stoodfor no factual truth but simply for a hope and for an academic concept; theevents of the last few months reduced them to a farce. So they were deliberatelywithdrawn in order to enhance their importance, and will later be restored andwill then assume a new and potent significance in the minds of all men. They arethe three words which must govern the New Age.Certain racial interpretations of ideals will also have to disappear in order tobe succeeded by new and better ones. This applies even to man’s understanding ofthe three words which we have been considering. “Liberty,” as the Lords ofLiberation may endorse it, is in reality the recognition of right humanrelations, freely adjusted, willingly undertaken and motivated by a sense ofresponsibility which will act as a protective wall; this will take place, notthrough coercive measures, but through correct interpretation and quickappreciation by the masses, who are apt to confound licence (personality freedomto do as the lower nature chooses) and liberty of soul and conscience. Yet thisliberty is the easiest aspect of the divine will for humanity to grasp. [272] Itis in reality the first revelation given to man of the nature of the Will of Godand of the quality of Shamballa. “Equality” is that peculiar understanding whichthe Coming One will reveal and which is based on a right sense of proportion,correct Self-respect, and understanding of the spiritual, yet natural, laws ofRebirth and of Cause and Effect, and which will be founded in future centurieson the recognition of the age of a soul’s experience and gained development, andnot at all on the loud emphatic affirmation that “all men are equal.”“Fraternity” is something that humanity itself will contribute as an expressionof the third aspect of divinity, basing it on right contact and right reactionto contact. Thus there will be developed gradually the true life-theme ofhumanity, which is brotherhood, founded on divine origin (equality) and leadingto a free and true expression of divinity (liberty).Perhaps with these thoughts in mind, this first stanza of the new Invocationwill assume more importance, and you will then be able intelligently to invokeThose Who can inspire to right action, thus bringing succour, and call forth theOne Who can save the situation through right leadership.On what level of consciousness He will ride, it is not for us to say. It ispossible that He will not appear upon the physical plane at all. Who can say?But the sound of His coming will be known and, speaking symbolically, thethunder of His horse’s hoofs will be heard. The influence which He will wieldand the energy which He will transmit from the Lords of Liberation willinevitably be potently felt, evoking an immediate human response. This willprove an incontrovertible fact. That His radiation will reach forth and surroundHis disciples, struggling in the conflict with evil, is also certain and sure.This will enable them to make the supreme effort which will win the battle forhumanity. That He will come in “the air” is a well-known prophecy from the NewTestament, thus enabling “every eye to see Him.” These words have more meaningtoday than when written nearly two thousand years ago, for this world conflict[273] is outstandingly an aerial one. Students and those using this Invocationwould be wise to bear this in mind or they may fail to see and recognise theDeliverer when He comes—a thing which has happened before.We come now to the second stanza, with its direct references to human attitudesand recognitions. For decades, I, as one of the spiritual teachers, along withmany others, have sought to awaken all to the fact of Light —light in the world,light coming from the plane of desire (called the astral plane quite often),light illumining science and human knowledge, the light of the soul, producingin due time the light in the head. You have been carefully taught that the rightuse of the mind in meditation and reflection will lead to the correct relationof soul and personality, and that when this has taken place, the light of thesoul ignites or fosters the light in the head and the man reaches the stage ofillumination. The reference in this second stanza is to the more extended ideaof the relation of humanity (the kingdom of men) to the spiritual Hierarchy (thekingdom of God). When these two are more closely aligned and related, light willbreak out among the sons of men as a whole, just as light breaks out in theindividual aspirant. This much-to-be-desired event can be brought about by thespiritually minded people in the world, by the men and women of goodwill, and bythe world disciples, standing with “massed intent.” This means with a uniform,united focus—a thing as yet rarely seen and much needed at this time. So manypeople are animated by wishful thinking, by hoping and by prayer; so few aremotivated by intention . Intention here is that unbreakable, immovabledetermination that a situation shall be handled, that what is needed in order torelease mankind assuredly must appear, for such is the mental intention of thefocussed minds of many. I would ask you to give much thought to these words“massed intent” and to differentiate with care between intention and desire.When humanity has fulfilled the conditions through a focussed mental demand,based on correctly formulated mass [274] intent, then will come the affirmationfrom the spiritual Forces.Let the fiat of the Lord go forth: the end of woe has come.The ending of the present evil situation is, therefore, a cooperative measure;and here, in this connection, we have the appearance of the Lord of CivilisationWho voices and engineers upon the physical plane the fiat of the Lord ofLiberation and of the Rider from the secret place. He aids and makes possible,owing to His control, the precipitating upon the Earth and in the arena ofcombat, of the power generated by the Lords of Liberation, expressed by theComing One and focussed through Him as the hierarchical Representative inEurope. The work of the Master R. has always been recognised as of a peculiarnature and as concerned with the problems of civilisation, just as the work ofthe Christ, the Master of all the Masters, is concerned with the spiritualdevelopment of humanity, and the work of the Manu is occupied with the scienceof divine government, with politics and law. Thus the incoming focussed energy,called forth in response to right invocation, is stepped down still nearer tohumanity, and the masses can then respond to the new impulses. You have,therefore:1. The Lords of Liberation, reached by the advanced spiritual thinkers of theworld whose minds are rightly focussed.2. The Rider on the white horse or from the secret place, reached by those whosehearts are rightly touched.3. The Lord of Civilisation, the Master R., reached by all who, with the firsttwo groups, can stand with “massed intent.”On the united work of these Three, if humanity can succeed in calling Themforth, will come the alignment and the correct relation of three great spiritualcentres of the planet, a thing which has never occurred before. Then: [275]1. The Lords of Liberation will receive and transmit to the Hierarchy energyfrom the centre where God’s Will is known and furthered .2. The Rider will receive this energy and take such action as will express it,plus the motivating energy from the centre where God’s Love is expressed .3. The Lord of Civilisation will stimulate and prepare the centre which we callhumanity for right reception of this re-vitalising, stimulating and releasingforce.Thus Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity will stand consciously related anddynamically in touch with each other. The Will of God, the Love of God and theIntelligence of God will thus fuse and blend on Earth and in relation to humanproblems. Conditions will consequently be brought about and energies will be setin motion which will end the rule of evil and bring war to an end through thevictory of the Forces of Light, recognised and aided by Humanity.This synthesis of the three energies, evoked through invocation and the responseof certain divine Potencies, is esoterically given the name of “the savingForce.” Of its exact nature and intended effects we know practically nothing. Ithas never before appeared in action on the physical plane, though it has beenfor some time active upon the mental plane. Though it is a blend of the energiesof the three centres referred to above, it is primarily the energy of the divineWill, which will be its outstanding characteristic. One hint here I will give.Just as the externalisation of the materialistic lodge of seven men, to which Imade reference above, has made its appearance and must be dealt with prior tothe future externalisation of the lodge of spiritual Lives (the appearance ofthe kingdom of God on Earth) which we call the planetary Hierarchy, so thewill-to-power of the forces of aggression has appeared on Earth and sought togain control over humanity. Note that aim. This will-to-power can only bedissipated when the highest aspect of the same energy is given free rein amongthe sons of men. The divine [276] and spiritual Will, carried on the impulse ofselfless love, can and must be evoked for the destruction of the selfish andwicked will-to-power, rampant now on earth under the direction of the focussedseven in Germany.The “saving force” must, therefore, be spread abroad. For long ages men haveprayed in the words of St. Paul: “Let the love of God be shed abroad in ourhearts.” Today the need is for the spread of the “saving force” to take hold ofour minds and to control from that directing centre, for it embodies the neededsalvation at this time. It will take the united efforts of all the three focalpoints of divine expression on our planet to make this possible, but it can bedone.In the final stanzas (which we need not take phrase by phrase, as theirsignificance is sufficiently clear) we have plainly put before us the methodswhereby humanity can play its part and do its share in aiding all those who arecooperating with the Forces of Light to bring this planetary war to an end.Look for a moment at the four words which embody the thought of what can be doneby men to bring to fruition the mission of the Coming One, the Rider from thesecret place. We are told that Light and Love and Power and Death must beinvoked to fulfil the purpose of the Coming One. Here we come right down to thepractical theme of man’s individual part in the processes of liberation. Here weare concerned with that which—within humanity itself—needs evocation in order toproduce right cooperation, right preparation and right understanding. Fourpotencies within the soul of man are available for his individual use in helpingthe Forces of Light—potencies he shares with all men to a greater or lessdegree, according to the expressive power of the soul. They are potencies whichare not innate in the lower self, but only in the higher. The lower selfreflects only distorted forms of the higher divine energies. This is a point tobe carefully noted. Of Light and Love I can say but little to you. To esotericstudents, these words are so familiar as to be somewhat meaningless, and onlythose [277] who can walk in the light, and whose major reaction is love ofhumanity, will comprehend the significance and the inter-relation of these fourwords.Light , with which to see the new vision, is needed by all. This will probablynot be an intensification of any earlier vision, no matter how apparentlyspiritual, but something so entirely new that you will need all the light thatis in you, and a trained insight, if you are to recognise it when contacted.Love , which is not emotion or sentiment, and which is not related to feeling(which is a distortion of true love), but is the fixed determination to do whatis best for the whole of humanity, or for the group (if the larger concept isnot possible to you), and to do this at any personal cost and by means of theuttermost sacrifice. Only those who truly love their fellowmen can see theissues clear and can grasp the inevitability of the things which must be done toend the present rule of terror and so usher in the new rule of peace. Peace isnot the goal for our race or time, no matter what many men think. This is acycle of steadily growing activity, with the aim in view of establishing righthuman relations, intelligently carried forward. Such activity and intense changeis not consonant with what is usually understood as peace. Peace has relation tothe emotional side of life and was the goal in Atlantean days, where peace was agreat spiritual issue. But peace and the love of peace can be a deadeningsoporific, and are so at this time. It is usually selfish in purpose, and peoplelong for peace because they want to be happy. Happiness and peace will come whenthere are right human relations. Peace and war are not a true pair of opposites.Peace and change, peace and movement, are the real ones. War is but an aspect ofchange, and has its roots deep in matter. The peace usually desired anddiscussed concerns material peace, and in every case is related to thepersonality, whether it is the individual personality or that of humanity as awhole. Therefore I deal not with peace, but am concerned with love, which oftdisturbs [278] the equilibrium of matter and material circumstance, and canconsequently work against so-called peace.Power is something which has ever been of interest, down the ages, to advancedhumanity and to those men who could respond to the will aspect through theirmental unfoldment. It is today becoming of interest to the masses and to themore mediocre types of men, and is hence oft misused and turned to selfishpurposes. The power here to be evoked out of the human soul, in this hour ofneed, is the ability to know the Plan and to work for its furtherance, thuscooperating with those forces which are endeavouring to re-establish order onEarth and to end the cycle of aggressive wickedness in which today we findourselves.The question arises here whether the cycle is susceptible to interference andwhether it must not perforce run its appointed course. I would remind you thatthe law of cycles is the law governing the appearing and the disappearing ofgreat and active energies which pass in and out of manifestation, fulfilling thepurposes of Deity and yet limited and handicapped by the quality of the formsupon which they make their impact. If any intervention is possible and takesplace, it will be an “intervention in time.” Such an intervention is hinted atin the sacred scriptures, such as the New Testament, where it is foretold that“for the sake of the elect, the time shall be shortened.” The real meaning ofthis (which is not apparent in the rather inadequate translation which we have)is “because of the elect or because of those who know and who take right action,the progress of evil can be arrested.” This is encouraging, and I commend thethought to your attention. There is a power which such “elect” canwield—understanding its nature, preparatory and selfless.And Death—to what does this refer? Not to the death of the body or form, forthat is relatively unimportant; but to the “power to relinquish,” which becomesin time the characteristic of the pledged disciple. The new era is coming; thenew ideals, the new civilisation, the new modes of life, of education, ofreligious presentation and of government [279] are slowly precipitating andnaught can stop them. They can, however, be delayed by the reactionary types ofpeople, by the ultra-conservative and closed minds, and by those who cling withadamantine determination to their beloved theories, their dreams and theirvisions, their interpretations and their peculiar and oft narrow understandingof the presented ideals. They are the ones who can and do hold back the hour ofliberation. A spiritual fluidity, a willingness to let all preconceived ideasand ideals go, as well as all beloved tendencies, cultivated habits of thoughtand every determined effort to make the world conform to a pattern which seemsto the individual the best because, to him, the most enticing—these must all bebrought under the power of death. They can be relinquished with safety andsecurity and no fear of results, if the motive of the life is a real and lastinglove of humanity. Love, true spiritual love as the soul knows it, can ever betrusted with power and opportunity and will never betray that trust. It willbring all things into line with soul vision.Again we have the energy of the three centres with which we are becomingfamiliar, and can see them being brought together and their triumphant relationbeing fused and blended. It thus becomes apparent that Those Who formulated thisnew and vital Invocation believed firmly in the power of humanity—upon its ownlevels of consciousness—to express the three divine potencies, Will, Love andActivity, in some measure. The demand goes forth to the Coming One to aid in theblending of the three upon Earth, so bringing them into physical planeexpression, and thus unite the potencies of the human kingdom with the potencieswhich He will bring with Him for the saving of humanity. Only when humanityoffers all that it has to give to the service of the sad, the suffering, and theoppressed, and will work actively and intelligently to bring about release, canthat full cooperation be established between the inner and the outer potencieswhich is so deplorably needed at this time. Unless, for instance, those who canuse this Invocation parallel its voiced expression with some form of definite[280] physical plane service, and so aid constructively the Forces of Light,their efforts will prove negligible. It is humanity alone which can precipitatethe new incoming energies from the Lords of Liberation and make possible Theiractivity on Earth. It is humanity alone which can open the door on to thephysical plane for the Rider from the secret place. The stupendous innerPotencies can reach certain levels of human activity and contact, such as themental plane, but their further progress downward into outer expression, powerand manifestation, is dependent upon the potent, magnetic, indrawing power ofman himself.The thought lying behind the words Construct a great defending wall might besimply expressed in the words: Thus far and no further. The limit ofeffectiveness of the evil expression and of the power of the aggressors has beenreached if the disciples and the men of goodwill actually now play their properpart. Symbolically, they can put up an impregnable wall of spiritual light whichwill utterly confound the enemy of humanity. It will be a wall ofenergy—vibrating, protective, and at the same time of such power that it canrepulse those who seek to pass in their pursuit of evil and wicked objectives. Ispeak in symbols but my meaning will be clear.One point you need to grasp more clearly, and it is both an encouragement and apoint difficult of belief. If the sons of men who are cooperating with theForces of Light at this time stand with steadfastness, and if the “massedintent” of the men of goodwill is brought down from the mental plane (where mostgoodwill, desire, prayer and invocation becomes “frozen”) and is carried awayfrom its easy focus in the wish life of the aspirant, goodwill becomes active inexpression and in tangible deed upon the physical plane, so that the work donethrough the means of invocation and prayer, plus the needed fighting for theright, is done by those who can truly coordinate and integrate on all threelevels and thus function as a whole. This will mean the finish of the dominanceof matter for all time. Such a desirable [281] condition may come very slowly,from the standpoint of man’s myopic vision, and may even not become apparent inits full significance to you in this life; nevertheless the victory will havebeen gained. Matter and materialistic interests will no longer rule the cominggeneration as they have ruled the last two. When the forces of aggression, ofgreed and cruelty are driven back, it will mean the conquest of selfish desireby unselfish love and sacrifice. This is the reward of those with whom we work,if reward is desired. This achieved situation will then bring into closerrelation humanity and the spiritual Hierarchy; they will be en rapport in amanner new in history. The defeat of the oppressing nations and the liberationof the oppressed will be only the outer and visible sign of an inner andspiritual event—one for which all enlightened people are working. It will—aftera period of adjustment, which will necessarily bring its own peculiardifficulties—usher in the new world, with all that is entailed in that phrase.I have placed before you the possibility. I would reiterate, as I have in thepast, that it is humanity which determines its own fate. Men have transcendedthe child stage and are now adult, though not mature. Maturity is achievedthrough self-engendered experience and decision, and for some time we who seekto guide have confined our efforts to reaching the intelligent people,impressing the spiritually minded, and in stimulating humanity to right actionwithout encroaching upon man’s growing expression of freewill. So the outcome isunpredictable, though we may see a certain measure of inevitability in futurehappenings. But man is free to choose the way that he shall go, and much of theresponsibility for his choices rests upon the shoulders of the more instructedof the human family and upon those who have achieved some measure of vision.With these thoughts upon the new Invocation I would leave you to work out theseideas in the recesses of your reflective consciousness. I would ask you to usethe Invocation frequently, with dynamic intent and true understanding, [282] andthus cooperate—by its use, by your love of humanity, and by your activity on theside of the Forces of Light—with those on the outer and inner planes who areseeking to drive aggression back to the place from whence it came, and to endthe rule of hate and fear."},{"pageContent":"SECTION THREE — FORCES BEHIND THE EVOLUTIONARY PROGRESS OF THE RACETHE DOCTRINE OF AVATARSMay 1941[285] As we enter the momentous month of May this year, I have asked myself ifthere is any way in which I can arouse the world aspirants and my disciples to atruer appreciation of the immanent significance of the presented opportunity,and also if there is any way in which I can simplify and make more real to youthe Doctrine of the Coming One—linked as it is to the teaching of every greatreligion. In all of them, the idea of a subjective, spiritual Order, concernedwith the developing welfare of humanity, is to be found.This is an age of culminations. Such culminations appear today in the field ofreligion as well as in the field of science and politics. All the great lines ofhuman approach to reality and to truth are passing out of the realm of thetangible and exoteric, into that of the intangible and esoteric. Science israpidly becoming the science of the unseen and of the unprovable; religion hasemerged from the realm of the mystical into the clearer atmosphere of theoccult, and must now emphasise the reality of the unseen as the efficient causeof the seen; politics and governments are engaged with processes of thought andideologies.What then is the true inner structure of reality which will provide the neededstrength for humanity at this time, thus sufficing to satisfy man’s demand fortruth and prove adequate to answer his ceaseless yet intelligent questions?I would assert here that the great and satisfying reply [286] to all humanquestioning and human need is to be found in the doctrine of Avatars, and in thecontinuity of divine Revelations. This is the persistent belief—ineradicable andunalterable—that (at major moments of world need) God reveals Himself throughAppearances, through a Coming One. This doctrine is found in all the basic worldreligions, in every time and age; it appears in the doctrine of the Avatars ofthe Hindu faith, in the teaching of the return of Maitreya Buddha or the KalkiAvatar, in the belief in the Western world in the return of Christ and HisAdvent or second Coming, and in the prophesied issuing forth of the divineAdventurer of the Moslem world. All this is tied up with the undying belief ofmankind in the loving Heart of God, Who ever meets man’s need. The witness ofhistory is that always the appearance of man’s necessity has been met with adivine Revelation.The reason for this faith, innate in the human heart, is to be found in the factof the nature of Deity itself. The Christian statement that “God is Love” isfounded on that deepest, recognised, spiritual fact . The expression of thisdivine characteristic can be summed up in the words from The Voice of theSilence:Compassion is no attribute. It is the Law of Laws—eternal Harmony, Alaya’s Self;a shoreless, universal essence, the light of everlasting right and fitness ofthings, the law of love eternal.To this everlasting Compassion the cyclic appearance of the Sun Gods of theancient myths, the World Saviours and the Avatars bear witness and are theguarantee.The Wesak FestivalAt the time of this Wesak Festival, I would call your attention to the fact thatthe annual return of the Buddha to bless His people everywhere and to convey themessage of wisdom, light and love to humanity—coming as He does [287] from thevery Heart of Deity Itself—is the outer evidence and guarantee of inner divineguidance and revelation in this present world cycle of 2500 years. Year by yearHe returns. For a brief minute He reminds us that God exists and ever loves;that He is not unmindful of His people; that the heart of the universe isunalterable compassion, and that man is not alone. To bring this recognitionabout and to make this appearance possible, a living Triangle of Energy iscreated and focussed through three great spiritual Individuals, Who evokerecognition both in the East and in the West. They are known to believers ofevery faith and all nationalities. These Three are:1. The Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days, Sanat Kumara, the planetaryLogos, Melchizedek, He to Whom Christ referred when He said, “I and My Fatherare One.”2. The Buddha, the Illumined One, the Revealer of the light and the wisdom whichcome to us from sources far greater than our planetary Life, a Messenger of theGods.3. The Christ, the Son of the Father, the World Saviour, the Redeemer. He Whohas remained with us and Who is gathering His sheep into His fold, the Lord ofLove.In these Three, Whose nature is radiant love and light, humanity can grasp insome measure the nature of divinity. They are greater than is known or realised;human intelligence and aspiration can only sense Their essential nature; Theirspiritual potency has to be stepped down if mankind is to bear the pressure ofthe impact of the energy They wield and seek to transmit. It is this steppingdown process which takes place at the time of the May Full Moon, and it isbrought to a “focus of transmission” by the massed intent of the Hierarchy andthe massed demand of the world aspirants and disciples—itself drawn forth by themassed need of the people of all lands.[288] Here, my brothers, is a simple statement of the facts which must begrasped by all of you who seek to participate intelligently in the WesakFestival and who are anxious to act as transmitters of the spiritual energywhich will, at that time, be poured out to suffering humanity. This WesakFestival in 1941 can prove to be a “Changer of Conditions” and a major turningpoint in the life of mankind if every spiritually minded person can bringhimself to the needed point of selflessness, disciplined purity and resultantreceptivity.There are certain fundamental truths which lie behind all revealed religions.They are essential to the spiritual growth and the progressive realisations ofdivinity by man. All else found under the term “doctrine” and allied phrases arebut expansions of these fundamentals, explanatory in nature, expressive of humaninterpretations, and formulations of evolutionary recognitions. These are mainlyadditions and are in the nature of adornment, speculation and prediction; theyare constantly subject to change, to rejection or development as man’s intellectand spiritual perception unfolds; they are not basic or unalterable. It is theunalterable truths which must be discovered and recognised as the new worldreligion takes form on Earth and conditions human thought and consciousness inthe coming New Age.The Basic Truths To DateThese basic truths never change because they are related to the nature of DeityItself and have become apparent to mankind through revelation, as evolution hasproceeded and man has developed the needed perceptive faculties and the requiredpersistence of search, plus the unfolding of the inner light of the soul. Thesetruths, inherent in the divine nature, reveal the soul of God. They are:1. The Law of Compassion. This is the truth of right relationship, of lovingunderstanding, of actively expressed Love . It is the foundation of brotherhoodand the expression of the inner unity. [289]2. The Fact of God. This is the truth that Being is God Immanent and GodTranscendent; it involves the recognition of the great Whole and the relatedpart; it is the knowledge of divinity, ascertained through right relationshipand identity of origin. It is the revelation of the life of God, pervading allthat is (God Immanent), and of that same life, providing that still greatercosmic relation (God Transcendent) which is the final guarantee of all progressand of progressive revelation. ‘Having pervaded this whole universe with afragment of Myself, I remain’ is the challenge of Deity and the eternal hope ofhumanity. This is the answer of Life Itself to the demands of humanity, to theenquiries of science and to the whole world problem. God is here, present amongus and in all forms of expression; He includes, pervades and remains beyond. Heis greater than all appearance. He reveals Himself progressively and cyclicallyas man gets ready for further knowledge.3. The Continuity of Revelation . Ever down the ages and at each human crisis,always in the hours of necessity, at the founding of a new race, or in theawakening of a prepared humanity to a new and wider vision, the Heart ofGod—impelled by the law of compassion—sends forth a Teacher, a World Saviour, anIlluminator, an Avatar. He gives the message which will heal, which willindicate the next step to be taken by the race, which will illumine a dark worldproblem and give to man an expression of a hitherto unrealised aspect ofdivinity. Upon this fact of the continuity of revelation and upon the sequenceof this progressive manifestation of the divine nature is based the doctrine ofAvatars, of divine Messengers, divine Appearances, and inspired Prophets. To allthese history unmistakably testifies.4. The Inevitable Response of Humanity . I have expressed in these simple wordsthe instinctive spiritual reaction of man and of the undying human spirit to thethree above foundational truths. This divine spirit in humanity must ever, andmost surely does, respond to the divine Appearance. The witness to this is sureand proved. There is that in [290] mankind which is akin to God and whichrecognises its own when it appears. Such is the unshakable reality in the humanheart, and recognition is the inevitable reward and result of revelation.5. Progress . The reaction of the individual man and of the masses of men to thecontinuity of revelation—historically proved—cannot be denied. It is the basicfact of religion. The types of that revelation may vary but each newrevelation—given in response to human need and demand—has ever led humanityonward towards a steadily brightening goal and a greater glory. The revelationmay come on varying levels of the human consciousness. It may be the revelationof new lands to conquer, terrestrial or mental. Some person pointed the way. Itmay be the recognition of new laws and facts in nature, scientifically graspedand used; it may be the response of intelligent man to increased knowledge,producing a new type of civilisation. Some liberated spirit pointed the way. Itmay be the response of the human heart to the Heart of God, leading to themystical beatitude, and to the recognition of spiritual Being. It may be thereaction of man to some new teaching, some further unfoldment, resulting in anew and enriched religious approach to the centre of life. Some Messengerpointed the way. But always it has meant progress, a moving forward, a rejectionof some existing limitation, a repudiating of the undesirable and the evil.Always it involves the recognition of the possible, the ideal and the divine.6. Transcendence. This means the innate capacity to pass beyond so-callednatural law. This surmounting of limitation is ever taking place and thisprocess of transcendence will call forth increasing recognition. It marks thenext major phase in the manifestation of divinity in man; it signifiesdomination over physical law and humanity’s imminent triumph over the forceswhich have for so long held him to earth. Of this transcendence the presentmastery over the air is the symbol. Man is rapidly mastering the four elements.He cultivates the earth; he rides the waters; he [291] controls the electricalfires of the planet, and he flies triumphant through the air. The question nowemerges: What, my brothers, next? Another transcendence lies ahead. It is one ofthe things which the coming Avatar will reveal.With the lesser leaders, whom the human spirit evokes to its assistance, I shallnot deal. I seek to unfold somewhat the Doctrine of Divine Messengers, ofAvatars. From whence come They? What is Their nature? Who are They and what isTheir relation to humanity, to the Hierarchy and to still greater groups ofLives? These are questions which normally arise and need clear answering.An Avatar is a Being Who—having first developed His Own nature, human anddivine, and then transcended it—is capable of reflecting some cosmic Principleor divine quality and energy which will produce the desired effect uponhumanity, evoking a reaction, producing a needed stimulation and, as it isesoterically called, 'leading to the rending of a veil and the permeation oflight.' This energy may be generated within the human family and focussed in aresponsive Messenger; it may be generated within the planet itself and produce aplanetary Avatar; it may be the expression of the life impulse and energy of thesolar system, or of sources outside the solar system and therefore cosmic. Butalways it is focussed through a manifesting Entity, is called forth by a demandor massed appeal, and evokes response and consequent changes in the lifeactivity, the culture and the civilisation of mankind.The response or reaction of humanity to the divine Messenger establishes in duetime the recognition of something transcendent, something to be desired andstriven for, something which indicates a vision which is first a possibility andlater an achievement. This is the historically proven process and testifieseventually to a fact . This new fact, when added to the facts established byother and earlier Avatars, enriches the spiritual content of the humanconsciousness, enhances the spiritual life of the race, and stimulates man tomove a step forward into the world of reality [292] and out of the world ofillusion. Each revelation brings him nearer to the world of causes.At the present time, the Avatars most easily recognised and known are the Buddhaand the Christ, because Their messages are familiar to all and the fruits ofTheir lives and words have conditioned the thinking and the civilisations ofboth hemispheres; because They are divine-human Avatars and represent somethingwhich humanity can more easily understand; because They are of like nature tomankind, “flesh of our flesh and spirit of our spirit.” They therefore mean moreto us than any other Divine Emergence. They are known, loved and followed bycountless millions. I would ask you to ponder on the potency of the nucleus offorce which They have set up. The establishing of a nucleus of energy,spiritually positive, is the constant task of an Avatar. He focusses or anchorsa dynamic truth, a potent thoughtform or a vortex of attractive energy in thethree worlds of human living. Then, as the centuries pass, that truth and theeffect of Their lives and words begin steadily to condition human thinking; theestablished thoughtform acts increasingly as a transmitter of divine energy asit expresses a divine idea, and this in time produces a civilisation, with itsaccompanying culture, religions, policies, governments and educationalprocesses. Thus is history made. History is but the record of man’s cyclicreaction to some inflowing divine energy, to some Avatar or some inspiredLeader.Divine InterventionIn considering the subject of Avatars I would like to point out that (from thestandpoint of mankind at his present point in evolution) Avatars are of twokinds, as might be expected when the consciousness of humanity is subject to thecontrol of the pairs of opposites. These two are:1. Those Avatars Who are the embodiment of the Angel of the Presence, whetherthat Presence is the [293] soul in man, the planetary Logos, someextra-planetary Entity, some Cosmic Being, or an Expression of Cosmic Good.2. Those Avatars who are embodiments of the Dweller on the Threshold, whetherthat Dweller is the human Dweller on the Threshold, planetary Forces ofMaterialism, or some Aspect of Cosmic Evil.Let me attempt to make this analogy a little clearer. Just as in the case ofindividual man there comes a point in his life experience when the Angel of thePresence is sensed, known, seen and recognised as the revealer of divinity, soin the history of the race of men, the same great illumination may come.Revelation confronts the aspirant. Revelation confronts humanity. God is knownwithin the human heart. God is known by mankind. This recognition of divinity inits varying aspects is naturally a progressive one—each stage and each lifebringing its own revelation of the beauty of divinity and the glory of lightmore truly and clearly before the disciple. Similarly, there come cycles whereinthe Dweller on the Threshold appears and confronts the aspirant, challenging hispurpose and progress and blocking the door which leads to expanded life andliberation. The Dweller challenges the freedom of the human soul. So it is alsoin the life of a nation, a race, and humanity as a whole.The Angel of the Presence indicates divine possibility, reveals to the attentivedisciple the next step towards liberation which must be made, and throws lightupon the immediate stage of the Path to Light which must be trodden. So does theAvatar Who reveals the Lighted Way to humanity.The Dweller on the Threshold summarises in itself the evil tendencies, theaccumulated limitations and the sum total of the selfish habits and desireswhich are characteristic of the material nature of the disciple. The Angel ofthe Presence indicates the future possibility and the divine nature. So does theAvatar. The Dweller on the Threshold indicates the past with its limitations andevil habits. So [294] do those Avatars Who from time to time appear as theembodiments of evil and of the lower nature of mankind. And, my brother, They doappear from age to age.Some cycles in a disciple’s life present one aspect of a “confrontation” andsome another. In one life he may be entirely occupied with fighting the Dwelleron the Threshold or with orienting himself to the Angel of the Presence andpermitting the divine conditioning energy to flow into him; he may be succumbingto the influence of the dread sum total of his evil and material desires or hemay be drawing gradually nearer to the Angel. But—and this is the point ofimportance—it is he himself who evokes one or other of these manifestations. Soit is with humanity. The call of humanity’s soul, or of humanity’s materialnature, must evoke response, and thus an Avatar can manifest. It is the magneticappeal or the massed intent of the disciple or of humanity which produces themanifestation. In other lives, the disciple may simply swing between the twopoles of his being, with no conscious effort, no direct confrontation and noclear understanding of life purpose. So does humanity.Eventually, however, there comes a life wherein the disciple is confronted byboth the Dweller and the Angel simultaneously and the major conflict of hisexperience takes place. So it is today in the world. The spiritual and thematerial are in conflict, and humanity itself is the battleground.Again, a correspondence to the Doctrine of Avatars can be seen in the disciple’sindividual life. When he has achieved right desire and has made a true efforttowards correct orientation, then—when the conflict between good and evil is atits height—there comes a moment when he demands more light, more power, moreunderstanding, and liberation to take his next forward step. When he can makethis demand with firm intent and can stand steady and unafraid, response willinevitably come from the very Presence Itself. A manifestation of light and loveand power will stream forth. Recognition of need has then evoked response. Theconflict ceases; the Dweller departs to his [295] own place; the Path ahead liesclear; the disciple can move forward with assurance, and a better life dawns forhim.So it is for humanity. A demand rises to the very gates of Heaven; the massedintent of humanity is that evil must end and a better and truer life becomepossible. At the moment of greatest tension and of difficulty the demand goesforth. Response comes. The Avatar appears and light pours in, making the wayclear. New hope awakens and fresh determinations are made. Strength to establishright relationships streams through the body of humanity, and mankind emergesinto a more spacious life, conditioned by truer values. A fusion becomespossible between the outer world of daily living and the inner world ofspiritual realities. A fresh influx of love and light is possible.Today the moment of adequate tension in the life of humanity has been reached.The Angel of the Presence and the Dweller on the Threshold are at grips.Humanity stands apparently at its darkest hour. But the cry is going forth foraid, for relief, for revelation, for light, and for strength to shake off thatwhich is evil. The massed intent of the world aspirants is directed towards theworld of truer values, towards better human relations, more enlightened livingand a better understanding between all men and peoples. With massed intent theystand, and their ranks are steadily increasing. With an increased focus of thewill-to-good, with a clearer apprehension of future possibility, with a fixeddetermination that the world move forward in conformity with the divine pattern,and with an urgent cry for help, humanity stands expectant of relief. In everyland there is a growing recognition that when mankind reaches the psychologicalpoint where, having done all, there is naught to do but stand, then someExpression of a divine determination to intervene will appear; there is agrowing belief that human effort towards righteous action will be supplementedby the emergence of a divine Force, Person or Event which will bring theconflict to an end.It might here be pointed out that in similar though somewhat less potent crisesin the past, this divine intervention [296] superseded human effort, but that itis hoped by Those Who are seeking to aid humanity that such intervention willtoday simply supplement human effort—a very different thing.Therefore, humanity everywhere today awaits the Coming One. The Avatar is sensedas being on His way. The second Coming (according to prophecy) is imminent, andfrom the lips of disciples, mystics, aspirants and all enlightened people in alllands the cry goes up, “Let light and love and power and death fulfil thepurpose of the Coming One.” Those words are a demand, a consecration, asacrifice, a statement of belief and a challenge to the Avatar Who waits in HisHigh Place until the demand is adequate, and the cry clear enough to warrant Hisdescent and His appearance.Demand without paralleling action is useless, just as faith without works isdead. It is here that there is a break in the magnetic link which should unitethe Avatar with the demand for His coming forth. His emergence must be caused bya fivefold chain or thread of energy: the focussed will of the people, themassed intent of the world disciples and aspirants, plus their desire, theiractive participation in the task of clearing the way for Him, and completeselflessness. Only when humanity has itself done everything possible to adjustthat which is wrong and to end that which is evil, and has carried this efforteven to the sacrifice of life itself, can He, the Desire of all nations, appear.Today this is being attempted. The great event of the appearance of the Avatarcan be made possible by a little increased effort. The mission of the Buddha atthis particular Wesak Festival is to add that new impetus, that freshillumination, and that added power and fixed purpose which will enable mankindto surmount this crisis. From the side of the spiritual Forces of the planet,everything will then have been done to make the appearance of the Avatarpossible. From the side of humanity, I would ask you: What will be done?Between the Source from which all Avatars come forth [297] and humanity, standsthe Hierarchy of Love, stands Christ and His disciples, stand the Masters of theWisdom. They are united, all of Them, in one stupendous effort to aid mankind atthis time to surmount the Dweller on the Threshold and to come closer to theAngel. This necessitates some greater help and this help will be forthcomingwhen humanity and the Hierarchy in one fused and blended effort stand withmassed intent, invoking that aid and expecting it also.The Appearance of AvatarsSince the year 1400 (a date to which I referred earlier) there have beenconstant appearances of lesser avatars, called forth in response to minorcrises, to national dilemmas and religious necessity. They have taken the formof those men and women who have championed successfully some truth or some rightcause, some human right or correct human demand. All these people have workedactively upon the physical plane and seldom received recognition for what theytruly were; only history, at a later date, laid emphasis upon their achievement.But they changed the current of men’s thoughts; they pointed a way to a betterlife; they pioneered into new territories of human achievement. Such a one wasLuther; another was Columbus; still others were Shakespeare and Leonardo daVinci—to mention only four who so lived and thought and acted that theyconditioned after events in some field of human living and are still recognisedas pioneering souls, as leaders of men. With these disciples I shall not deal.They embodied ideas and made history—not the history of conquest but the historyof progress. I seek to consider with you those still greater Appearances Whocome forth from some hidden centre, remote from or near to humanity, and Who“release from crisis the sons of men.” These fall mainly into four relativelyminor groups:1. Racial Avatars. These Appearances are evoked by the genius and destiny of arace. The typical man (in quality and consciousness, not necessarily physically)foreshadows [298] the nature of some race. Such a man was Abraham Lincoln,coming forth from the very soul of a people, and introducing and transmittingracial quality—a quality to be worked out later as the race unfolds. Comingforth correspondingly from the realm of cosmic evil, and responsible for thefocus of materialism upon the planet today was Bismarck. Both men came forthwithin the same one hundred years, thus demonstrating the balance in nature andthe constant interplay of the pairs of opposites. They are both types of themost powerful Avatars which humanity itself has as yet produced. They emergealong the lines of government , of the first ray and in the department of theManu, and are very sensitive to Shamballa force. Such Avatars frequently emergeat the founding of a nation. This is true of both Bismarck and Lincoln.2. Teaching Avatars . These Appearances sound a new note in the realm of thoughtand of consciousness; they reveal the next needed truth; they pronounce thosewords and formulate those truths which throw light upon the spiritualdevelopment of humanity. Such Avatars were Plato, the first Patanjali andSankaracharya; they emerge upon the second ray line of energy, in the departmentof the Christ and are expressions of hierarchical force. When I say thedepartment of the Christ, I would remind you that the name “Christ” is that ofan office—an office that has always had its Head. I do not mention the Christ orthe Buddha as among these Avatars because They are Avatars of another class andof infinitely greater potency.3. Ray Avatars. These great Beings come forth at relatively long intervals whena ray is coming into manifestation. They embody the quality and the force of aparticular ray. Next century, when the seventh ray has achieved completemanifestation and the Piscean influence is entirely removed, the seventh rayAvatar will appear. His work will demonstrate the law, order and rhythm of thecreative process as it works out on the physical plane, blending spirit andmatter. And as this ray is called the Ray of Ceremonial Order or Ritual, [299]He will be largely instrumental in producing those conditions which will permitof the reappearance upon Earth of the Mysteries of Initiation, of which theHierarchy is the custodian. He is necessarily connected with the Great WhiteLodge on Sirius. This fact does not, however, concern us now, for we await thecoming of a still greater Avatar.4. Transmitting Avatars. These manifestations of divinity appear at those greatcyclic moments of revelation when humanity needs the expression of a new truthor the expansion of an old one in order to progress still higher on theevolutionary ladder. These Avatars issue forth in response to demand and are notso much concerned with racial development as They are with the subjectiveunfoldment of consciousness and with the stimulation of humanity as a whole. Ofthese Avatars the Buddha and the Christ are outstanding examples. They were notonly human-divine Avatars, and hence able to link humanity with the Hierarchy,but They were something far greater and more important. They had reached thepoint where They could act as Transmitters of certain cosmic principleswhich—focussed in Them in an extra-planetary sense—could stimulate the deeplyhidden and latent corresponding principle in humanity. They transmitted andbrought something from outside the planetary life—from the very Heart of God tothe heart of man. The Buddha, because He achieved illumination, stimulated thelight in the world, in humanity and in all forms. He served the soul of man. TheChrist, because of His stupendous achievement—along the line ofunderstanding—transmitted to humanity, for the first time in human history, anaspect and a potency of the nature of God Himself, the Love principle of theDeity. Prior to the advent of the Buddha, light, aspiration, and the recognitionof God Transcendent had been the flickering expression of the human attitude toGod. Then the Buddha came and demonstrated in His Own life the fact of GodImmanent as well as God Transcendent; the idea of God in the universe and of Godin humanity evolved. The Selfhood of Deity [300] and the Self in the heart ofindividual man became a factor in human consciousness. It was a relatively newtruth to be grasped by humanity. It had always been known by disciples andinitiates.However, until Christ came and lived a life of love and service and gave mankindthe new commandment to love, there had been very little emphasis upon God asLove in any of the world Scriptures. After He appeared as the Avatar of Love,then God became known as Love supernal, love as the goal and objective ofcreation, love as the basic principle of relationships, and love workingthroughout all manifestation towards a plan motivated by love. This divinequality Christ revealed, and thus altered all human living and human goals. Atthat time too there came a great impetus and extension to the work and growth ofthe Hierarchy, as there was in a lesser degree when the Buddha came. Manyinitiates became Masters; many Masters passed to still higher work, and manydisciples took their places in the ranks of the initiates. There was numericallya great influx of aspirants into the ranks of accepted disciples.I have considered some of these Avatars in my earlier writings under differentnames and categories. I deal with Them here simply in an effort to reach a widerpublic with the teaching on the doctrine of Avatars or of divine Appearances.The Bible is full of such Appearances, but little is really understood aboutThem. The above are the more familiar groupings.In September 1940 I gave an interpretation of a new Stanza of the GreatInvocation, and in that communication I spoke of Divine Embodiments as thehighest type of Avatar for which humanity could look at this point in itsevolution. I spoke of the activity of the Hierarchy and of Shamballa, shouldthese two divine Agencies decide that intervention in the form of a widespreadcataclysm (engulfing all peoples) was necessary, and I referred to the emergenceof inspired leadership as another and lower aspect of divine guidance andparticipation.[301] Such inspired leadership is now being given to humanity by WinstonChurchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, in contradistinction to the focussedleadership of the forces of materialism through Hitler and another man in hisgroup. But it is not with this form of leadership as expressive of the avataricprinciple that I deal here. Such leadership is called forth by elements presentin humanity itself. I deal now with a fifth type of Avatar, greater than theother four. These Avatars have not, in this world cycle, experienced human life.5. Divine Embodiments. These Avatars appear rarely; and when They do, theeffectiveness and results of Their work are very great. They issue forth intomanifestation via the centre at Shamballa, because They are an expression of thewill nature of Deity; They embody divine purpose; the energy pouring throughThem and transmitted by Them is focussed through the Lord of the World; They canonly be reached by the united voices of the Hierarchy and of humanity speakingin unison; Their service is evoked only by realised need, and only after thosewho call Them forth have added to their faith strenuous action and have donetheir utmost, alone and unaided, to overcome evil.They never descend lower than the mental plane, and the main emphasis andattention of Their work is directed to the Hierarchy; the Hierarchy is Theirtransmitting agency; They occasionally reach those thinking people, focussed onthe mental plane, who have clear vision, potent resolve, directed will and openminds, plus of course, essential purity of form. These Avatars express the Willof God, the energy of Shamballa, and the impulse lying behind divine purpose.When They do come forth, it will be the destroyer aspect of the first ray ofpower which They will express; They bring about death—the death of all old andlimiting forms and of that which houses evil. Their work will, therefore, fallinto two categories:a. They will destroy the forces of evil, using the agency of the Forces ofLight. [302]b. They will reveal as much of the divine purpose as humanity is able to graspthrough its best minds and most dedicated aspirants; They will clarify thevision of the world disciples and of all who have the disciplined will-to-knowand who are dedicated to and expressive of the will-to-good. This knowledge andthis will are needed in the coming period of readjustment.How They will bring the present evil conditions to an end and how They willdestroy the present evil state of materialistic aggression I may not reveal. Itis not yet certain that human development and understanding and the massedintent of humanity will be adequate to the needed demand and strong enough tocall Them forth. Time alone can determine that. God grant that the aspirants anddisciples of the world will awaken to the opportunity and the imminent andwaiting possibility. The plight of vast groups of people upon the planet todaylies heavy upon the heart of the Hierarchy. But to bring release and theAppearance of the Power that can liberate, human cooperation is needed. Nowhereis this more desperately needed than among the German people in their unhappyland. God grant, therefore, that those Germans who have vision may join theforces of those who are seeking to free Germany and the German people from theimposed tyranny of the evil Lodge, working through their seven representativesin Germany. Once the Germans who are living free lives in other lands can thinkin terms of humanity as a whole and not in terms of national glamours, revengeor self-pity, then their voices will be added to those of the other free peoplesand to those of the aspirants and disciples in all other nations.When the Avatar comes He will convey to humanity something for which we have asyet no true name. It is neither love nor will as we understand them. Only aphrase of several words can convey something of the significance and then onlyfeebly. This phrase is “the principle of directed purpose.” This principleinvolves three factors: [303]a. Understanding (intuitive and instinctual, but intelligently interpreted) ofthe plan as it can be worked out in the immediate future.b. Focussed intention, based on the above and emphasising an aspect of the will,hitherto undeveloped in man.c. Capacity to direct energy (through understanding and intent) towards arecognised and desired end, overcoming all obstacles and destroying all thatstands in the way. This is not destruction of forms by force such as is nowbeing imposed on the world, but a destruction brought about by the greatlystrengthened life within the form. Only the next one hundred years will revealthe significance of this statement and then only if the massed intent of thepeople evokes this Avatar of Synthesis during the next twelve months. I havecalled this Being by this name because it expresses the quality and theobjective of the force He brings and wields.Another and lesser Avatar is also awaiting a call from humanity. He isesoterically related to the Avatar of Synthesis, being overshadowed by Him. ThisAvatar can descend on to the physical plane into outer expression and can thusstep down and transmit the stimulation and quality of the force of the greaterAvatar Who can come no nearer than the mental plane. Who this Coming One may beis not yet revealed. It may be the Christ, if His other work permits; it may beOne chosen by Him to issue forth, overshadowed by the Avatar of Synthesis anddirected in His activities by the Christ, the Lord of Love. In this way, theenergies of both Shamballa and the Hierarchy will be focussed through the chosenComing One. Thus a triangle of loving, purposeful energy will be created whichmay prove a more effective way of releasing energy and a safer way, than thefocussed impact of one selected force might be.I realise the difficulty of this subject and perhaps may simplify the matter bya brief summation:1. A great cosmic Avatar can come if the Hierarchy and humanity can standtogether with massed intent. [304]a. He will descend into the three worlds of human endeavour, but no nearer thanthe mental plane.b. He will transmit a cosmic energy whose quality is Synthesis . This willexpress itself through harmony and unity, producing necessarily understanding,promoting goodwill, and eventually ending the separative, isolating tendenciesof mankind.c. His note and vibration can only be sensed by those whose individual note isalso synthesis and whose life objective is the will-to-good. These areconsequently the Members of the Hierarchy, the disciples and aspirants of theworld and a few of the men of goodwill.2. A Messenger or Avatar of equal rank to the Christ in the Hierarchy (orpossibly Christ Himself) may come forth as the Representative of the Avatar ofSynthesis and as His transmitting Agent.a. This lesser Avatar works today as one of the senior Members of the GreatWhite Lodge and is in close touch with the Christ, with the Manu and with theLord of Civilisation, the Master R.; He will act as the Coordinator between theHierarchy and Shamballa. He will fuse and blend in Himself, through the qualityof His Own life, the three great energies:The will-to-spiritual power.The will-to-love in its spiritual connotation.The will-to-manifest spiritually.b. The antiquity of the achievement of this Coming One is to be found in thename applied to Him, which is found in so many of the world Scriptures: TheRider on the White Horse. This refers to the time prior to the phrase sowell-known in the Christian fields: “The Lamb slain from the foundation of theworld.” In the earlier cycle, the then initiates spoke of the “sacrificialhorse, slain to all eternity.” It conveys the same basic idea.c. This Avatar can descend to the physical plane and there appear, to lead Hispeople—as the Prince Who leads through war to peace. [305]d. The whole problem before the Hierarchy and humanity today, in connection withthe coming Avatar, can be summed up in the following four questions:Can He bring the energy of synthesis with Him, thereby bringing about rapidchanges?This depends upon His being overshadowed by the Avatar of Synthesis and uponthat Avatar being evoked through the demand and the massed intent of humanity,aided by the Hierarchy.Will the demand of the people be strong enough to evoke the higher potency, orwill it be too feeble because of the failure of the world disciples andaspirants to focus this massed intent throughout the planet?Will the higher overshadowing not take place and only the lesser Avatar come toinstitute a slower method of gradual reform?This slower method will be necessitated only if and because humanity will havedemonstrated its inability to call forth and receive the higher measure and morepotent vibration of divine energy. It is entirely for the decision of the worlddisciples and aspirants; not the decision of poor bewildered, deluded humanity.Will the world disciples and aspirants appreciate the crisis and opportunity?They have not yet, as a whole, done so.3. The Hierarchy today stands with massed intent. The cry of the masses isrising up to the very gates of Shamballa. It is stronger by far than the demandof the spiritually oriented people—the disciples, the aspirants, the men ofgoodwill. They seem—from the viewpoint of the Hierarchy—to be overcome byinertia, to be engrossed by their theories and idealisms, and to be blind to theissues at stake. Can they be aroused? Can they stand with focussed intent,strenuous [306] physical service and activity, and determined effort tostruggle, even unto death, for the defeat of evil? Can they preserve the innerattitude of love and non-separateness? Can they relinquish all for love ofhumanity? Can they sacrifice everything for the cause of freedom and ofrighteousness? This is the problem confronting Those Who are working for theappearance of the Greater and the Lesser Avatars Who can at this time savehumanity if humanity desires salvation and will take the needed steps.The Needed StepsThese steps are various in kind though one in intent. The first step is torealise clearly what are the methods whereby the Avatar can come and so reachhumanity. These are the same methods, whether it is the Avatar of Synthesis,working through the Hierarchy, or the Avatar of Coordination (as I might callHim), working through humanity and representing the greater Avatar upon thephysical plane.The methods whereby Avatars reach and influence Their agents or those whorespond to Their note, vibration and message are three in number.1. Overshadowing . Where there is kinship in quality, in objective and innature, it is possible for the Avatar to overshadow some Member of the Hierarchy(as in the case of the Avatar of Synthesis) or some disciple or aspirant wherehumanity is concerned (in the case of a lesser Avatar). This is done throughmeditation, through a directed stream of thought energy, the presentation of athoughtform and the evocation of the focussed will of the one who isovershadowed. All this proceeds rapidly where there is close cooperation betweenthe latter (the sensitive responding disciple) and the Avatar. The Christ istoday in very close rapport with the Avatar of Synthesis, and this rapport willcontinue, becoming closer and closer until the Full Moon of June; He is givingall possible aid, as is His Brother, the Buddha. It is this which makes thecoming Full Moon of May of such supreme importance.[307] A group of Masters and initiates Who are specially related to the Christ’sdepartment, as well as a group working under the Master M., are endeavouring torespond to this overshadowing which is only possible—even to Them—whentransmitted to Them by the Christ. (I talk here of mysteries.) It will thereforebe apparent to you that, as They succeed and become increasingly sensitive toand aware of this overshadowing energy of the great Avatar, Their disciples onearth can also—in a dim and faint way—become responsive to the ideas that areformulated in the mind of their particular Master in response to avataricimpression. Ponder on this.2. Inspiration . This is more direct than overshadowing and more potent inresults. Certain Members of the Hierarchy and, above all, the lesser Avatars,are inspired from “on high” by the cosmic Avatar and become at times directexpressions of His mind, His energy and His plans. This is the spiritualcorrespondence to obsession. In the case of obsession, a man is taken possessionof and inspired by some evil entity; in inspiration, there is no possession butonly what is called “identical response”—a very different thing. In the onecase, the free will and intelligent understanding of the Master or the discipleis enlisted on the side of the spiritual Agent; the spiritual man, functioningas a soul, becomes the channel for forces, ideas and activities other than hisown but to which he gives full intuitive assent. It is all carried forward withfull understanding and consciousness of method, process and results. It is anact of free spiritual cooperation, for the good of humanity, in the work of agreat spiritual Force or Being. The cooperation of the Master Jesus with theChrist is a case in point. In connection with the coming Avatar, it may involvethe cooperation of the Christ or of a “kindred, equal soul” with a cosmic Beingor Presence, taking place on still higher spiritual levels of consciousness andproducing an incredibly focussed potency.In the case of obsession, the evil force enslaves the personality which, in themajority of cases, is but a shell. Of this, Hitler is a case in point. Thisproduces greater potency [308] on the physical plane and on the astral plane; itis quicker and more immediate in results, but the lasting power is less and theeffects are relatively temporary.In the processes of inspiration, the lesser Avatar—through His life and contactsin the three worlds—will necessarily influence sensitive, spiritually orienteddisciples and aspirants, and thus the inspiration coming from the cosmic Avatarbecomes in time a group inspiration , and therefore can be more safely handled.This group inspiration can happen today. If it does, there will then be asimultaneous appearing of the cosmic Avatar, the World Saviour in the Person ofthe lesser Avatar, and—at the same time—a group saviour, composed of responsivedisciples and world servers. Ponder again on this.In this way, if you will note carefully, there is established a direct linkedchain from humanity, via the Hierarchy, to Shamballa. The Hierarchy is workingat the establishing of this chain, aided by Their disciples. The demand for thecooperation of all aspirants is now going forth, because the times are urgent.If this relationship can be established (and it will be a sad day for humanityif it cannot), then the third method of avataric expression becomes possible.3. Appearance or Manifestation. Every possible step has been taken by theHierarchy to enable the Avatar, the Coming One, to appear. What these steps arecannot be declared here. Only some questions, suggesting possibility, arepermissible. Think you that His body of manifestation is already on Earth,waiting to be overshadowed, inspired and used at the right time, as was thevehicle of the Master Jesus by the Christ? There are those who say that it iswaiting and has been waiting for 22 years. Is it possible that there will be asudden descent of the Prince of Light and Peace to change present conditions bythe effectiveness of His radiance and His message? There are those who look forHim to suddenly appear, and they number millions of expectant people. Some sayHe is already on His way. Is it possible that this Wesak Festival will see Himapproach [309] nearer to the Hierarchy and make a contact with Them? Some say itwill take place. Can the “massed intent” of humanity evoke response and lead tothe appearance on Earth of the lesser Avatar? Some say nothing can stop it.Prophecy, expectation and the present time cycle testify to the opportunity.This possible dual event—the coming of the Avatar of Synthesis to the Hierarchyand of the lesser Avatar, His Representative, to humanity—can be a probablehappening if the world disciples and aspirants measure up to the opportunity.The Immediate TaskI enter upon my concluding remarks wondering if anything I can say will awakendisciples to the needed spiritual effort—a spiritual effort which must findexpression in physical plane decisions and activity. A certain aspect ofphysical plane effort is already being undertaken by them through very force ofcircumstance: Red Cross activity in every land, response to urgent, surrounding,physical need, and the mobilisation of their time and resources by leaders inall countries are the keynotes of the time. But it is the inner spiritualactivity and orientation (paralleling the outer activity) which is required.This is an activity which is preceded by clear factual thinking and decision.Can the world disciples and aspirants evidence this full life on all levels? Arethey capable of an intensive inner life as well as of unflagging attention toouter duty and demands? This is the problem. Are they capable of laying asidetheir own pet theories and trifling ideals (trifling in the face of theappalling world situation) and focus every possible effort on fighting evil uponthe physical plane, as well as on other levels, with every possible agency? Canthey at the same time live that dynamic life of thought and inclusivecomprehension which will find expression in the voiced appeal to the Avatar? Itis feeling and fanatical adherence to a loved ideal which frequently standbetween a disciple and effective service on the physical plane. It is old habitsof [310] thought and the determined effort to interpose some mystical dreambetween conditions as they are and conditions as they could be, if disciplestook right action, which have prevented effective service.But, my brother, all things have to become new and that means a new vision, anew idealism, and a new life technique. Past ideals, past dreams and pastefforts to tread the Path and express brotherhood have produced mostsuccessfully a certain changed attitude in the race, a new orientation to thelife of the spirit, and a focussed intention to move forward. That was thedesired goal and that goal has now been reached.The right attitude is now present in many people in every race, and it is therecognition of this which has called forth the activity of the Brothers of theShadow at this time. They realise that the time of their power is shortening.The hold of the materialistic values over man is steadily becoming weaker. Sofar has man progressed that there are enough people in the world today to turnthe tide if they can be aroused from their apathy.I tried to arouse them to speed and clear thinking between the years 1932-1938but though something was accomplished, it was not enough. The blindness,illusion, separativeness and inertia of the aspirants of the world todayconstitute one of the factors with which the Hierarchy has to contend. Aspirantsare preoccupied with their own little affairs and with their own small efforts,instead of relinquishing everything in an endeavour to unite on the neededappeal and activity. They are contending for their own interpretations of truth,and for their pet ideals of peace, living or work and—like Nero—they “fiddlewhilst Rome burns.” All their lives they have fought for an ideal and a dream,and they love that more than they love humanity. Yet—all that is needed is sucha deep love of humanity that it works out on all levels of activity and all lifeeffort. If the idealists of the world would realise the situation as it is, theywould relinquish all that they hold dear and come to the rescue of humanity, andthus snatch the helpless masses back from [311] slavery and death. They wouldbattle for the freedom of the human soul with every weapon in the armory ofmankind. They would hold back the forces of aggression by force itself if needbe. They would aim at clear thinking, and thus clear the channel for the inflowof spiritual force. The major prerequisites today for true world service are anoverwhelming love of humanity and a sense of proportion. The only requirementstoday for disciples and aspirants may be summed up as follows:1. The doing of everything possible to bring the war to an end. Every physicalplane method must be used to drive the forces of evil and of cruelty back totheir dark place. Physical plane methods, when motivated by unchanging love ofhumanity and under the direction of an enlightened soul, become agents ofrighteousness. There are worse things than the death of the physical body; thereis the enslaving of the human soul.2. The focussing of the inner life towards the Hierarchy in radiant faith. Theway of the Coming One must be made clear, and the life force must be dedicatedto the outer life of compassion.3. The clarifying of the mental life in the pure light of the soul. Discipleslive too much in the world of feeling; hence the clouding of their vision. Whenthey have clarified their minds and see the situation whole, they can thenappeal to the Avatar to make His appearance. This appeal must be made via theChrist.4. Disciples must endeavour to understand what are the objectives of the Avatar,and thus fit themselves to cooperate.The second step is to understand clearly what is the task which must beundertaken in preparation for the Coming One. This entails four things:1. The effort to stand with all other disciples and aspirants in an attempt tocall forth the Avatar, to reach Him by focussed intensive thought and to evokeHis response. This [312] is the purpose of the new Invocation. It voices intent,makes demand and pledges cooperation.2. The providing of a nucleus or group through which the Avatar of Synthesis canwork when the lesser Avatar has come forth upon the physical plane. Thisinvolves individual activity, the sounding out of a clear note, based on clearmental perception, the recognition of those allied in the work and thedevelopment of conscious group work. In this group work the personality issubordinated and only the following determinations are dominant:a. The determination to offer group service—as a group—to the world group.b. The determination to establish right human relations upon the planet.c. The determination to develop everywhere the spirit of goodwill.d. The determination to withstand evil through planned group activity.3. To construct a network of light and service in every land. This is begun inthe individual environment of the server, and gradually extended throughout theworld. It was with this idea in view that I suggested the forming of trianglesof people, pledged to use the Invocation and to extend its use through theworld. It is my specific plan to help mass world thought and thus evoke theAvatar, and likewise to provide a world group through which the new forces andenergies can function, the new ideas can spread. and the coming world order findadherents.4. To prepare the general public for the Coming One by pointing out thetestimony of the past, the recognition of the universal need for divineintervention and the holding out of hope to the distressed, the doubting and thetortured. In His appearance lies hope, and history testifies that it hasfrequently happened at times of world crisis.Such are the possibilities which I present to your understanding. I have toldand taught you much in past years. [313] I have often asked for your cooperationand your help in world service. Some have responded and given help. Many havelonged to aid. The majority have done little or nothing. In this moment ofcrisis (within the world crisis) I again ask for your cooperation and leave youto make your decision.May the love of God and of your fellowmen inspire you; the light of your soulsdirect you and the strength of the group enable you to aid in bringing good outof the present evil by right action and clear thinking.~THE WORK OF RECONSTRUCTIONAugust 1941As I have studied the world disciples during the present world crisis, I seethem borne down by inertia—not the inertia that comes from selfishness andself-centredness, or the inertia due to lack of understanding of the nature ofthe crisis, or the inertia due to sheer laziness, but an inertia based upon adeep, inner depression, to a sense of human failure and to an introspectivenesswhich is natural but useless at this time. Some disciples (both on theprobationary path and on the path of discipleship) take refuge in theperpetuation of the activities with which they were engaged when the warstarted; some take refuge in a determination to wait until the crisis is over,and appear to think that any work along the old lines of spiritual endeavour isof no real use; still others take refuge in a feverish outer occupation withthings which the average man who is not spiritually oriented can do as well, ifnot better. Some disciples and aspirants are spending their time fighting apsychic sensitivity, evoked by world conditions; many are simply overwhelmed andstunned by humanity’s pain and agony, by the horror of the moment, by anxietyover the future, and by anticipation of still worse happenings. Theirimaginations are working overtime and quite uselessly. To some of theseattitudes, all of you are susceptible.I write today to call all world disciples and aspirants to an intensive periodof preparation for future activity and [314] work. From now until the Sun movesnorthward, I would ask each of you to do three things:First, strengthen—through meditation, prayer and clear thinking—your faith,confidence and joy, and above all else, deepen your love of humanity, carryingthe love of the soul through on to the physical plane and into all your humanrelations.Secondly, eliminate out of your personality life, as far as you can or should,anything (mental, psychic, emotional or physical) which might hinder your futureusefulness.Thirdly, plan together for the work of the future. This work can be inauguratedshortly and must be started slowly, carefully, and with unreserved cooperationwith me and with each other. It must be carried out steadily and undeviatingly,with no lost motion, once its outlines are determined, and it should be carriedout together .The major need today for each and all who must sponsor the work of the futurethat I am seeking to do with your cooperation and understanding, is to fosterthe growth of the will to love and work. This effort on your part will expressitself in a steadily deepening love for humanity—for all men and for each other.It will demonstrate in a constant effort to invoke the spiritual will inself-discipline and persistence; it will show itself in the intelligent carryingforward of the plan as I shall seek progressively to outline it.This work can only be carried forward by people who love their fellowmen enoughand have sufficient illumination to enable them to work with me dependably for aperiod of five years in the face of anything which may happen; they must bepeople who will endeavour to permit no personality misunderstanding to hindertheir usefulness and their group interrelation, and who—because they loveenough—will ceaselessly subordinate everything to the task which must be done.The second thing I ask you to do is to gather out of all the past pamphlets andmy later writings those plans and instructions on service which will beapplicable to the changed conditions and in the immediate future. Study thiscarefully along with the requests and [315] suggestions in this letter, so thatyou may know what I, your Tibetan teacher, feel could and should be done by youin the service of the immediate future. I would ask those of you who care to doso to meet together at the time of the Full Moon in October for fellowship,united meditation, consecration and consultation. I would ask those of you wholive and work at more distant points to write briefly your reactions to thesuggested endeavour, indicating how you feel you can best aid in the task. Iwould ask all of you who associate yourselves with me in the work of the future,each day to use the very brief meditation which I outline below. It is dynamic,affirmative and—if rightly used—should link head and heart, leading thus tointelligent loving service, and it should also serve to bind you all together inthe closest spiritual unity. This will aid in the vitalising of the ethericbodies of all workers, and therefore in a group vitality which will beirresistible.Suggested MeditationEach morning, prior to starting the day’s activities, achieve an inner quiet,see the Self as the soul, place your self at the disposition of the soul, ofhumanity and of your group.1. Then say silently and with full dynamic intent:At the centre of all love I stand; from that centre, I the soul will outwardmove; from that centre, I the one who serves will work. May the love of thedivine Self be shed abroad in my heart, through my group and throughout theworld.2. Then, focussing your attention and dedication, see the group to which youbelong as a great centre of love and light, irradiating the world of men,bringing relief, light, love and healing in increasing measure.3. Brood then upon the plan to be carried out and upon the indicated service forthe coming day. Do this as the [316] soul, keeping the personal lower self in awaiting attitude, like a servant attentive for instruction.4. Then say:The joy of the divine Self is my strength.The power of the spirit of man shall triumph.The Forces of Light do control the forces of evil.The work of the Great Ones must go on.The Coming One is on the way. The Avatar approaches.For this we must prepare.5. Close with a minute of dynamic quiet.I will ask you to do this meditation every day until January 1st, 1942, when Iwill give you another step in this Meditation of Preparation for the Coming One.Its aim is to prepare all of you interiorly. I would ask you also to read andre-read the instruction I gave you on Avatars. (pp. 285-313.)You will constitute the initial group which I am asking to collaborate with mein the reconstruction work of the New Age. As time goes on, subsidiary groupswill be indicated who can work in the various countries as focal points in thegreat network of light which is forming everywhere under the inspiration of theworld disciples and aspirants in every land, as they work under instruction ofthe Hierarchy. Some of them are known to you. Many of them are not known to anyof you. But they represent the working groups of all the Masters, and upon theirshoulders rests the work of reconstruction, aided by the thousands and thousandsof men and women of goodwill in every land.The meeting upon the ocean of the two world disciples and leaders marked acrisis in world affairs. The Eight Points (see page 318) formulated by themconstitute the basis of the coming world order. They were necessarily large inoutline and without details as to application. It will be for a liberatedhumanity to work out these details, to make the necessary adjustments, and to sorearrange human life that the higher spiritual values may prevail, a simplermode of life may be instituted, a greater freedom be established, and a widerresponsibility be shouldered by every [317] man. This will take time. Some ofyou may not live to see the full clarification of the way that humanity must go(the “Lighted Way” of the future), but you can, all of you, aid materially inthe important task of preparation, in indicating the needed world principles, inspreading the gospel of goodwill, and in establishing right human relations. Thework done in thought, in love and in dedicated activity during the next threeyears is of paramount importance and will produce the stabilisation to takeplace in the last two years of the five mentioned by me above as your immediatetime of cooperation.You who are working in the midst of the chaos and conflict cannot and will notbe able to judge accurately the measure of accomplishment. Only the Members ofthe Hierarchy (Masters, initiates and the disciples who are out of incarnationat this time) can get a true perspective. The working disciples in the forefrontof the battle have to carry on their work in the midst of chaos, turmoil,questioning, pain, and distress. They cannot, therefore, see the picture whole.A few of the more advanced who can “live on the heights and in the valley andthe depths” simultaneously can see truly, but their numbers are not large, andthe Christ spoke a true word to His bewildered disciple when He said, “Blessedare they who have not seen and yet have believed.” The following of themeditation, adherence to the instructions given, persistence in the face ofdifficulty, and a staunch belief in the beauty of the human spirit, in the loveof God, in the victory of the Forces of Light and in the approach of the ComingOne—these are the attitudes which we, the workers on the inner side, ask ofthose we choose to carry on our work upon the outer plane.This letter deals with the forming of the group to carry out the plans for1942-1945. It is being formed in the dark of the year, at the nadir point ofhuman distress, at the most difficult moment in human history, at a point ofcrisis and—in the case of many of you as individuals—at the time of your deepestpersonal difficulty. I tell you that all of you, together, are equal to thetask.[318] I will again write to you and will indicate the practical aspects of thework. In the meantime, ponder and reflect upon what I have written here; beginthe meditation and endeavour to strengthen your link with your soul and witheach other. Let love—not emotion and sentiment—control your thoughts, words anddeeds. I would ask you also to study carefully the indications I have given inthe past as to the work which must be done, and I would ask you also to studycarefully the Eight Points outlined on the high seas, and the Four Freedoms sooft discussed throughout the world.Let quietness and depth characterise your inner life.~THE EIGHT POINTS OF THE ATLANTIC CHARTERAugust 14, 1941The President of the United States of America, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and thePrime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing his Majesty’s Government in theUnited Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain commonprinciples in the national policies of their respective countries on which theybase their hopes for a better future for the world.First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other;Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with thefreely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned;Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of governmentunder which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights andself-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them;Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect for their existing obligations, tofurther the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, ofaccess, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world whichare needed for their economic prosperity;Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nationsin the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labourstandards, economic advancement and social security. [319]Sixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to seeestablished a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling insafety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all themen in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want;Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceanswithout hindrance;Eighth, they believe that all the nations of the world, for realistic as well asspiritual reasons, must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since nofuture peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to beemployed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of theirfrontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanentsystem of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential.They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which willlighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.~THE FOUR FREEDOMSJanuary 6, 1941In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a worldfounded upon four essential human freedoms.The first is freedom of speech and expression—everywhere in the world.The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywherein the world.The third is freedom from want—which, translated into world terms, meanseconomic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetimelife for its inhabitants—everywhere in the world.The fourth is freedom from fear—which, translated into world terms, means aworldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashionthat no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggressionagainst any neighbour—anywhere in the world.Franklin D. Roosevelt~PRACTICAL STEPS IN THE RECONSTRUCTION WORKSeptember 1941[320] It will be obvious to you that there is little that I can say as to exactprocedure until such time as humanity itself has decided the future conditionsof human living. I mean exactly that, my brother. The war is not yet decided.There is a widespread feeling that God (as we call the Central Power of Lifeitself) will or should intervene; there is a vague demand that right shouldtriumph and a desperate hope that something unexpected will happen that willgive victory to the arms of the Forces of Light. This attitude of painfulexpectancy is universal among the masses—both those in the fighting countriesand the neutrals also. In the neutral countries (of which the United States isthe largest and the most important) there are two factors conditioning thethinking of the people:First, a deep-seated though not unnatural selfishness, which prompts thedetermination to take no real part in the war, except what can be done safelyand at the least possible cost, and secondly, a steadily emerging cleavagebetween the relatively few who have vision and want actively to help theembattled Allies (the agents of the Forces of Light), and the selfish manywho—for political, religious or personal reasons—will fight every effort tocommit their country further than it is at this time committed, and who hopenevertheless to share in the benefits of victory.In the last analysis, however, the world situation must be settled by humanityitself. The Hierarchy cannot interfere. Humanity has the privilege and theopportunity to take right action now . The Coming One Who is being so ferventlyinvoked throughout the world, either by prayer, invocation or unvoiced demand,is concerned with readjustment, with the right fusion of forces and with thehealing of the peoples. This worldwide invocative demand is largely prompted bya defeatist position or by a compassionate longing to see the long agony of manended; it is seldom prompted by conviction, by the recognition of possibility ora paralleling decision to right the wrongs which lie back of the world [321]situation and which constitute the alibi of the enemy of humanity—Hitler and hisassociates.The Coming One will make His appearance when the tide of battle has definitelyturned and the forces of evil are being driven back to their own place. I havemade no pronouncement as to time, person or place. I have simply indicated thatthere is a possibility (subsequent to right action) of the appearing of the Onefor Whom the centuries have long waited, to Whom prophecy in all lands, therapidly developing intuition of the people, and established precedent, all bearconstant witness. His hour is near, provided the needed steps in preparation aretaken, and it is for that that I have approached you. I have not indicated theplace of His appearing, the nature of His emergence, or the country of Hischoice. These are the details which concern Him and not you. Your task is to getready for His coming. This involves right understanding and increasing labourfor humanity as a result of the experience of love within your own individualconsciousness. This I emphasise.I have suggested three preparatory steps to the group of aspirants with whom Iam in touch:1. The use of the great mantram or invocation—in two parts (see pp. 144, 249).The first was used in 1936 and the second in 1940, and is still in use. Thefirst was intended to centralise human desire, and the second was intended toutilise what mental power was available to invoke Those Who (on the innerspiritual side of life) are waiting to help. This They cannot do unless the wayis made possible for Them by humanity itself. Such is the law.2. A general process of educating the public in the fact and use of goodwill. Agreat but undeveloped potency is still locked up in mankind which, if evoked byman himself, will prove adequate to do two things:a. Lay the foundation for a stable peace—active and positive because the resultof active and positive action—after the Forces of Light have won the victoryupon the physical plane.b. Provide the subjective synthesis or network of light, [322] embodying theforce of goodwill as the expression of right human relations. This willguarantee a workable world order and not an imposed tyranny or a mystical andimpossible dream.3. The realisation of a general outline of that coming world order which will bein line with humanity’s need, basic in its implications, and which will providethat structure of living interrelation which will foster latent love,intuitional understanding and the creative power in man.Those are the three major objectives with which I have dealt in pastcommunications. I have also made suggestion as to modes of activity which arepractical—some of them of an exoteric nature, such as the compiling of mailinglists, in every country, of those who think and express goodwill; others, suchas the creation of the network of light, through the formation of triangles. Itis not for me to decide the details of your outer activities. That is for you todo, and for that I have called you to assist me.Let me recapitulate a few of the things which have been undertaken in our jointwork so that you can clearly see the background of our coming effort and graspthe work as a whole.1. The first activity was the writing and distribution of the occult teachingsthrough the medium of the books which A.A.B. has assisted me to write. Thesewill serve (when the war is over) to lead humanity forward and nearer to thetime when present day occultism will be the theme of world education in somemodified form. The books which have been published can be stated—without anyconceit—to have no competitors, and these, rightly distributed, will serve auseful part in carrying the consciousness of man to higher levels and in makingclear the divine Plan for mankind. In them also the task immediately ahead atthe close of the war is clearly indicated.2. The founding and the work of the Arcane School. This was started by A.A.B. totrain those ready for esoteric teaching and to prepare them for the stage andwork of [323] Accepted Discipleship. The world today is full of groups occupiedwith the task of helping one or other of the groups of aspirants and seekers tobe found everywhere, or with the more general undertaking of raising the massconsciousness. The Arcane School was therefore formed for two purposes:a. Primarily to aid the Hierarchy in its work during the world crisis—a crisisfor which the Hierarchy has been long prepared. The Arcane School was not and isnot the only group with this objective, but it is definitely among the mostinfluential.b. To train probationary disciples to become accepted disciples, so that theHierarchy could find those who could safely carry spiritual power and bechannels of love and understanding to the world.You can see, therefore, that the Arcane School is not so much engaged in helpingthe individual as in aiding the Hierarchy to salvage humanity. For this work,training is required, and the Arcane School provides this.3. The fact of the existence of the New Group of World Servers was brought tothe attention of the general public, and on quite a large scale. This group iscomposed of aspirants, disciples and initiates, and is intermediate between thespiritual Hierarchy and the intelligent public. Its members are to be found inevery country, are unorganised except by their spiritual relation to theHierarchy and to each other, and through their effort in every field of humanconsciousness to lead humanity into a more spiritual way of living. They aim tofoster the growth of right human relations through goodwill, and this work isstill going on.4. The organising of the men and women of goodwill in every land so thateventually they can set the note of world goodwill for the new world order. Someof this work was started in 1934. Much lies ahead, demanding attention, and willhave to be accomplished in a period much more difficult than the pre-war period.The nucleus of this group [324] exists, and among them the livingness ofgoodwill is still unimpaired.5. The effort to utilise the power of sound and of thought combined wasundertaken through the use of the two great invocations which you have—as agroup—distributed throughout the world. Great world prayers have been used forages; men have been driven by desire and spiritual aspiration to pray, and haverecognised the power of the divine response. The art of invocation has been,however, relatively unknown, especially in the West. It employs the dynamic willand the focussed mind, and is intended to evoke response from the Forces whichwill condition the new world, which can come into being at the close of thiswar. A focussed will or intention, a convinced mind, a dedicated desire and aplanned activity are essential to success.6. The forming of triangles of light and goodwill, so that an inner network ofpeople, pledged to goodwill, to the use of the power of invocation and to thegrowth of understanding throughout the world can be created; and a beginning hasalready been made. This is a potent and workable mode of procedure, once it isgiven an opportunity to spread.7. The inauguration of an effort towards definite group work. This must be groupwork of a new order, wherein individual activity is subordinated to the groupobjective and the decisions of the group in conclave; it is not work carriedforward through the imposition of some one will upon a group of weaker wills.The individual and his mode of working are not regarded as of importance in thegroup consciousness, because it is the will of the group—unitedly dedicated to aspecific objective—which is the point of major importance. This is a newprocedure and something to which you can apply yourselves. In this group which Ihave now formed, opportunity will arise to demonstrate the practicality of thisnew ideal in service methods.These are a few of the undertakings in which we have for some years beenengaged, and it is suggested that all of [325] them be continued as a backgroundto all future work and a fundamental platform.You, as individuals, in this group (or in your relations with other groups) allhave your personal problems. These problems are simply your participation inworld karma and constitute your needed training ground and the field of yourspiritual experimentation. With them I shall not deal, for you are all adultsouls and progress by defined service, not by being helped. Your task is to aidthe work which the Hierarchy plans to do, to find the ways and means wherebythat service can be wisely rendered, to discover the manner in which world need(not your group need) can be met, to finance that share in the work of theBrotherhood to which you have been assigned by your soul, and to do your part indeveloping those human attitudes which are needed if true peace is to be foundin the world by 1975. If this work is soundly done, then a world unity can beestablished which will produce right human relations, a sound world politic, aunited spiritual effort and an economic “sharing” which will bring to an end allcompetition and the present uneven distribution of the necessities of life.In the past I have outlined for you the general programme and the hoped-forobjectives. I have given you much information and have indicated need and itspossible solution. I have given you practical suggestions as to procedures andmethods. I have asked—as I ask today—for your cooperation, and I ask it onbehalf of the Forces of Light, of the spiritual Hierarchy and of distressedhumanity.The present world crisis could be shortened if the spiritually minded peoplelived up to their inner belief and knowledge. The task of unifying the men andwomen of goodwill is today infinitely more difficult than it was before the war.It can only be done if each servant of the Hierarchy thinks clearly, lovesintelligently and serves to the utmost. I make no plea. I have pleaded much withall of you in the past, and the effort which resulted, though not a completefailure, was not adequately strong enough to off-set the forces [326] of evil,focussed in Germany, Japan and—to a much smaller extent—in Italy.This last statement (which I have made in other writings) has evoked resentmentin the minds of those who believe that the Forces of Light must love soindiscriminately that their work on the side of evolution is negated, and thateffort to promote the development of the human consciousness is renderedcompletely futile or should be held in abeyance until the fight is over. I wouldhere point out that if the Forces of Light—aided by you—did nothing to influencethe minds of men, the forces of materialism and of evil would triumph. Humanitywould then be spiritually defeated and its evolution would be set back for anindefinite period. I would here call your attention to the words of my greatMaster and yours: “By their fruits ye shall know them.” I would remind you thatthere would be no world war today if Germany had not marched on Poland. Thecause of the widespread cruelty, terror, murder and agony rests squarely on theshoulders of the seven men in Germany.Had the aspirants and the disciples of the world realised the situation earlier,and had they worked more wholeheartedly, the present catastrophe could have beenheld within bounds; it could have been retained and the problem worked out uponthe inner planes of thought and desire, and could there have been transmuted andthe needed readjustments made. But they failed to understand, and the stormbroke upon the physical plane.The next twelve months will be decisive in human affairs. By the end of 1942,chaos and difficulty will still be present, but the sound of the victor’strumpets will be heard. Will the victors be the Forces of Light, under whosebanners fight the Allies, or will evil triumph and greed reap the profits ofaggression? Will men be led into a darkness which—though not interminable—willengulf the human soul for decades? The answers to these questions lie in thedecisions and the activities of humanity itself. The Hierarchy waits.I have referred to the increased difficulty which will confront the men andwomen of goodwill (working under the [327] New Group of World Servers). Whatconstitutes the difficulty, if we analyse the situation? Two major factors:First, the steadily mounting feeling of intense resentment (amounting to hate inthe case of some groups and sections of suffering humanity), accompanied by adeep fatigue, a shattered psychological integration as the result of nervestrain, an acute fear of what the future may hold (scientifically developed bythe Axis powers), and a numbing of the soul which is the result of death onevery hand, loss, separation and the sight of untold pain and suffering.Secondly, the widespread physical destruction, wrought by the invading and thedefending armies—the destruction of great cities with their accompaniments ofcivilised living, the wholesale wiping out of industrial plants and themechanics of daily life, the sinking of the ships which distribute the rawproducts of civilised living and the complete disorganisation of all humanaffairs in every country in the world—directly or indirectly—and the breakingdown of the structure of well-established financial relations, plus thedisruption of the ordinary means of communication. Add to this the monetary ruinof the masses of the people, and you have a true and not a sensational pictureof the world state. Out of this wreckage of all that man has constructed duringthe centuries and out of the spoliation of all existing culture andcivilisation, the new world order must be built. And, my brother, it will bebuilt, and you can help prepare for this building of a more stable and beautifulway of life.This creative process begins always in the realm of intention, is impulsed bytrained desire, and will be brought into objective expression by the rightdirection of thought, the inspiration of right ideals, and the educating of theusually unthinking masses (who are, however, today thinking as never before), sothat humanity as a whole will appropriate these ideals. They then can be trustedto take the needed action. In this manner the desired conditions will take formupon the physical levels of daily existence. There are many enlightened thinkersworking at this time upon these problems; they are actively moulding publicopinion; [328] free minds in all countries, or their representatives in theoccupied lands, are already laying the foundations of freedom, more surely andsoundly than ever before; groups everywhere are organising for the rebuilding(mentally, psychically and physically) of our world and for the reconstructionof our civilisation on saner lines and safer foundations. More intimate andunderstanding relations are being established between religion, politics andphilanthropy, and the part which science, education and economics must play inthe future is being brought increasingly into the forefront of human aspiration.There is therefore no need for discouragement. There is only need for determinedright action and sacrificing effort. This must be based on faith in the humanspirit, on a conviction that good must ultimately triumph because it always has,and a knowledge that the New Age is dawning and that nothing can frustrate itsestablishment. To the advent of this new era the destruction itself bearswitness, because—again quoting my Master, the Christ—you cannot put new wine inold bottles. To your share in the preparatory work for the future new world Icall you; to renewed activity upon the outer plane of life I call you, and againI outline to you three years work, plus two years of activity which will growout of the three years preparation.Until May 1943, I suggest sound preparatory undertakings for future worldactivity. This must be accompanied by sound organisation, based on a long rangevision of what must be done, and by experimental effort. This is the immediatework for this group and for those whom they may later choose as collaborators.Small groups must grow out of this group later, when it is duly established andfunctioning.From May 1943, until November 1944, you should move outward into definite worldexperience and into a basic cooperation with any similar groups which areengaged in world salvage, primarily along the psychological line, for thepsychological rehabilitation of humanity will be the major outstanding need,paralleling that of economic readjustment. [329] These two must receive priorattention by all men and women of goodwill. This group must inspire, promote andstrengthen wherever and whenever possible. Such a task can only be undertaken bypeople who have no religious bias, no political antagonisms and no sense ofexclusiveness.From then until the close of 1945 or the beginning of 1946, the work shouldconsolidate, the men and women of goodwill will swing into increasing usefulnessand the potency of their thought and attitude in moulding public opinion shouldmake itself dynamically felt—if you all work as desired. It will be apparent,therefore, how important is the work that you can start now and stabilise duringthe next eighteen months. The major lines of action you already know, for thegoodwill work done in 1936 still remains basic and its processes should bere-studied and employed. But I would make the following practical suggestionsconcerning the group and its planning.1. Learn to know and trust each other, leaving each other free to work and planwithin the group plan; develop the experience of love in your individual livesand in your group relation. Meet regularly for discussion, planning and unitedmeditation—using the same meditation in this group as I have asked you to followindividually. Subordinate your own wishes and ideas to the group decision. Letthis be uniquely a group effort.2. Press forward with the Triangle work in every possible way and in everycountry open safely to contact. Plan this work along sound business lines,making a small group of you responsible for its functioning and success.3. Discover, and where possible contact, all groups which are motivated by atrue love for humanity, plus a groping after and understanding of the New Ageideals of freedom, cooperation and inclusiveness. I suggest a gradualcompilation of a mailing list of such groups, accompanied with samples of theirliterature and an analysis of their ideas. [330]4. Gather together all the many proposals that have been formulated byindividuals, groups of world thinkers and specialists in the different fields ofworld endeavour as to the New Order. Find out what is being suggested in themany different nations as to the New World Order—both good and bad. This willinvolve the reading of books, their digesting and analysis, the forming of asmall available library, and the study and accumulation of pamphlets on thesubject. By doing this, a thoughtform of great potency can be built which willinfluence the minds of men.5. Keep in touch with people in all countries—occupied and unoccupied—who canlater be swept into constructive activity. Thus this group will be ready tovitalise people and groups everywhere with whom they are in touch—some of whichwere formed prior to the war and are perforce inactive. The Units of Service inthe occupied countries are a case in point. Therefore keep in touch objectivelyand subjectively with as many people as possible, all over the world.6. The organising of the needed financial equipment to carry forward this workmust be the task of another group within this larger group of mine.7. Leaders of spiritual, religious and esoteric groups, as well as educationalgroups, should be approached in the interests of world unity. A letter should beprepared inviting such leaders into a comradeship of mutual friendship andcooperation—not of coordination or fusion. A “coming together” can thus beplanned for united strengthening and advice. Such letters should always be theproduct of group effort and suggestion, after being formulated by the smallergroup assigned to its production.8. A clear formulation of the objectives for which this group has been formedshould be drawn up for general circulation; wise business organisation should beapplied from the very start; right voluntary help should be enlisted; soundfinancial policies should be laid down.9. Definite work, preparatory to any work which future [331] necessity mayindicate in Europe or elsewhere, must be undertaken. It is not possible for youto undertake the rehabilitation of the entire planet! There is, however, muchthat you can do along the line of interpretation of ideals, of unifying and ofstrengthening other groups. There are also three things possible to this group:a. The discovery and aiding of the members of the New Group of World Servers inthe occupied countries and elsewhere, giving spiritual and practical materialaid.b. Work for the rehabilitation and correct handling of the children in thedevastated lands. This is an urgent need and has wide promise and greatimplications for the future world order. Concentration on this is desirable.c. Continue with the work of finding and organising the men and women ofgoodwill throughout the world. It is they who will constitute the agents of thisgroup and other New Age groups in the future. Work done by you prior to the waris thus to be continued, and along similar lines.10. Make a close individual study of the Four Freedoms and the Eight Points ofthe Atlantic Pact, so that the members of this group can soundly envisage thefreedoms of the New Age and can therefore think clearly, teach the new idealscorrectly, and aid in this main world objective. This understanding is moreimportant than you realise. Out of these suggestions your group plan can takeshape. Having made them and having indicated to you the lines of hierarchicaldesire, I shall say no more. The responsibility is yours, and to you I leave theworking out of these ideas. Move rapidly and as a united group with the Trianglework. It is basic in its usefulness and must be widely spread. Move withsureness, and more gradually, with the other aspects of the indicated work.The strength and usefulness of this group will depend upon the inner union andlove with which you work together, offsetting all personality reactions. Youwill help each other on all levels where help is needed. Let this group [332]work silently and as the Hierarchy works—impersonally behind the scenes. Letthem draw upon all available spiritual resources, dedicating all their mental,emotional and material reserves to the work of helping humanity, and let themknow (past all questioning) that the Hierarchy stands.~PREPARATION FOR FUTURE ACTIVITY AND WORKOctober 1941Certain questions arise in the minds of all disciples anent the general positionof the hierarchical effort, about the possibility of materialising the Plan, andparticularly concerning the share in these plans which spiritual groups canundertake. I would have you remember that disciples learn to work with the planby working ; they learn to discover the inner expanding consciousness ofhumanity by the development of an increasing sensitivity to it; and they findtheir coworkers in the Plan by the old and tried method of trial and error. Theless evolved the disciple and worker, the larger the number of trials and thegreater the number of errors.But the system works, for it is an eliminating as well as a perfecting process,and the residue which remains after due effort, can be trusted. You have those,finally, who remain and who are worthy of trust. Why does this system work?Because by its means the graces of humility, prompt obedience to soulinjunction, and inner integrity are unfolded and developed. Where these arepresent, there will be found sureness of touch when humanity is contacted;sensitivity to the impression of the Hierarchy when that Hierarchy is seekingcontact; and a right sense of proportion.One of the difficulties which comes to the server immersed in the thick of theundertaking is that of preserving contact with the vision. I refer to the visionitself and not to its materialisation. Perhaps I can make my meaning clear if Ipoint out that, just as long as the contact is a vertical one , the work isfairly simple, the next step is apparent and plain, the line of activity to befollowed is clear and the inspiration [333] is fresh and vital. But the momentthat the consciousness of the disciple becomes inclusive horizontally (and thatmust take place), then the difficulty becomes great, and the disciple begins tounderstand—for the first time—the true significance of the words, “the Cross ofthe Saviour.” Yet if he can train himself to stand where the four arms meet (Iam here speaking symbolically) he will discover that he stands in the place ofpower, and at the “midway point.” Then he can truly begin (again speakingsymbolically) to look off to the four corners of the earth, both subjectivelyand objectively, and with reality; immediately the strain is terrific.This is one of the difficulties confronting the New Group of World Servers atthis time. You will remember that some little time back I spoke of the crisiswith which the group is faced. How can I express in words the nature of thiscrisis? It is that of the invocation or the precipitation of the Plan, for thosetwo words are synonymous. This necessarily involves a strain—the strain ofprolonged inner contact and realisation, plus the effort to use skill in actionand due physical plane executive ability. The New Group of World Servers istherefore today pulled two ways. Its effort must be to stand ready at thecentre. The new group today stands at the very centre and must preserve and holdits position at all costs. That which signifies the most at this time is thespiritual poise and the spiritual sensitivity of the workers.It is to this important condition that the group members must pay due attention.Disciples and spiritual workers must not be so occupied with the details of thePlan, with the production of that which will produce the externalisation of theideas, that the spiritual training and strengthening of the workers isneglected. In the dust and turmoil and noise of the fight, grow not insensitiveand hard, or so preoccupied that the needs of those with whom you work areforgotten or pass unnoticed. Let love be the keynote in all relationships, forthe power which must salvage the world is the precipitation of love, and howshall that find its way onto the physical plane save through a group whose earsare attuned to its imminent emergence, and through the lives of those [334] inthe group who are irradiated by love itself? It is here that there is lack—notintentionally or because of the existence of its opposing quality—but simplythrough world pressure and strain. In the unfoldment of goodwill in the world atthe close of the war—which will be one of the major tasks of the New Group ofWorld Servers—let love be the active force among the senior members of thegroup. I would like to see more of it among all of you.As the executive side of the group work grows, and the will aspect of humanityis contacted and its power used to evoke the emerging crisis of love, anincreasing number of workers with first ray qualities will be drawn into theranks of the New Group of World Servers. This constitutes the second difficulty,and it is here that I feel the need to utter a word of warning. This coming inwill greatly strengthen the work but brings with it also great problems. Much ofthe work done hitherto has been second ray work; its quality is gentler, itstechnique is that of building and teaching, and its workers are magnetic andthey present, when brought together, no great problems of cohesion and of groupintegration. Of this aspect of work, the Arcane School is an example.When, however, first ray workers appear to aid in the expansion of the work andto carry it to the four quarters of the earth, then certain difficultiesinevitably appear. It is the dynamic quality of the power aspect which must beguarded against, not in the sense that it must not be permitted expression, butin the sense that it must be motivated by love, harnessed to gentleness, andqualified by understanding.The problem, therefore, will be to integrate first ray workers into the NewGroup of World Servers in such a manner that the destructive aspect of the raywill not cause difficulty, produce disruption or any obliteration of thedominant love note which should be the outstanding characteristic of all workerswith the Plan at this time. Otherwise, the precipitation of the crisis of lovewill be hindered.I would ask for an intensification of love between all of you, and a growth ofreal understanding. Forget not, at [335] the same time, that love is the greatattractive magnetic force, and will consequently draw to itself all that isneeded at the present crisis and for the materialisation of the vision in dueform on earth. This will require spiritual energy, sound business sense, skillin action and financial support. Remember that money is the consolidation of theloving, living energy of divinity, and that the greater the realisation andexpression of love, the freer will be the inflow of that which is needed tocarry forward the work. You are working with the energy of love and not with theenergy of desire, the reflection or distortion of love. I think that if you willponder on this, you will see the way more clearly. There are many first rayworkers wielding the power of desire and thus materialising money. There aremany first ray workers finding their way into the ranks of the workers among theNew Group of World Servers. Unless these workers are swept by love, their firstray energy will wreck the work of the group. Yet they are needed at this time,for they have the strength to stand unmoved at the centre. It is the conjunctionof the first and second ray workers which can carry the world through the comingcrisis of Reconstruction, and it will be of value if this is borne in mind byall of you in all work connected with the new group. It is important integratingwork.You might ask me at this point to be specific and state if there is anysignificant hindrance which needs to be offset or changed, once realised. Anunderstanding of all I have stated above will greatly help, for I have pointedout three difficulties. Add to this the realisation that a right handling of thebroad issues will automatically tend to take care of the details. By this I meanthat the establishing of sound inner group relations between all of the workerswill produce that inner cohesion and one-pointed effort which must inevitablyand surely produce the outer results and attract both the needed workers and theessential money.See to it also that one department of the work is not over-emphasised in yourminds to the exclusion of others, for that will produce strain, lack of balanceand sometimes [336] a sense of separation, leading if continued, to disruption.Let the consciousness be developed that there is one work being done by all, andthat the whole group is concerned in the entire activity. This inclusiveattitude should permeate the entire organisation, and thus the departmentalspirit need not enter in.One point I will touch upon for the clarification of your minds. The dailymeditation, both personal and in relation to the group, would produce betterresults if the focus of attention were given to the attaining of the neededinner attitudes, the intensification of the inner spiritual life ofunderstanding and the welding of all workers into one unity of service. A unitedattitude of love, of hopeful expectancy, of courage, of spiritual demand and ofdirected will is potent in results and will bring all that is required.Has there not been too much attention in the past to aspects of physical planeeffort, and to techniques of working? Has there not been too much considerationof how to do the work and too little consideration of the spiritual dynamics ofthe work itself? The need has been great and the problems many. The expansion ofthe work may seem necessarily to foster a departmental spirit. When suchsituations arise, it is necessary then to intensify the inner sense of unity.Differentiations are easy, for they follow the line of least resistance upon thephysical plane. But the work is one work, and the workers constitute one group.The need now is fusion and group understanding.Is it not true that a point of fusion achieved in the daily meditation by anindividual brings about right expression in the daily life and a right handlingof life conditions? A point of fusion achieved in group meditation will evokethe right results and produce an instrument of service of such power that itsprogress will be irresistible.The strain of the past three years has been long and great. Many of the workersare feeling it, and the need for love and strength is great. The strain aheadwill be no lighter, though it will register differently and bring differentproblems, but you are equal to it and to the task ahead. [337] Success can crownthe efforts being made, and the New Group of World Servers can measure up to theneed, if there is a more conscious and definite attempt to stand in thecentre—the place of loving power—and an increased ability to think in terms ofgroup synthesis and fusion, and to choose with wisdom those who (from innerdevelopment and outer ability, for these must go together) belong to the group.~AN IMPENDING CRUCIAL DECISIONDecember 1941As the last month of the present sad year is upon us, I come to you with amessage. The determination and the inner purpose of humanity will be so definiteduring the period when the Sun will begin to move northward—from December 25thuntil June 22nd, 1942—that the future of humanity for many hundreds of yearswill be decided. From that decision will date the coming New Age; on thatdecision, the Hierarchy will be able to make prediction and determine action; inthat decision will be discovered the point in evolution of the mass of men. Iurge you to face the future with strength, to free your minds from all vestigesof doubt, and to know (in your own life and for the race) that the forces ofmaterialism and cruelty will not triumph. Again I say to you, the Hierarchystands. Go forward with assurance.A deeply rooted subjective process is taking place in the human consciousnesswhich is evocative and producing definite effects. This needs to be recognisedand the nature of invocation understood by all who seek to aid their fellowmen.As I explained elsewhere in detail (Esoteric Astrology, pages 570-575) , thisprocess of invocation falls into two stages in the life of the individual andalso today in the life of humanity as a whole. The stage of aspiration ,irregular and vague but gradually becoming focussed and assuming power; and thestage of mysticism with its uncomfortably recognised dualism; this merges intooccultism which is the intelligent study of that which is hidden. It is becauseall [338] these stages are actively present today that we have the dire andwidespread crisis.It was the need to give a constructive trend and to focus the invoked energieswhich led me, under instruction from the Hierarchy, to give out—at widelyseparated points of time—two Stanzas or parts of a great occult mantram, thefirst one to help focus the aspirants from whom it met with full response; thesecond was also offered to the masses, but was intended to be a test and a“decision in a time of crisis,” hence made its appeal to the mentally focussedaspirants and disciples.I am explaining this because world conditions today warrant the use of bothStanzas now. The Great Invocation, as earlier used, should again be madeavailable to the masses. The second Stanza should be used by thinkers,occultists and disciples, and by all who respond to its note. In doing thisthere will be need on your part of great “skill in action,” so that you mayrightly and wisely distribute the two Invocations. The one will invoke the Riderfrom the secret place and aid in His evocation, for it is the Rider from thesecret place Who is referred to and invoked in the first Invocation; the otherwill invoke the Lords of Liberation.The blended invocation and the united call from the different levels of thehuman consciousness will bring a mighty appeal to bear upon the hidden Centresof the “Saving Force.” It is this united appeal which must now be organised.Thus the mass of humanity will be stimulated to move forward into light, and thenew world cycle, beginning in Aquarius, will be definitely inaugurated byhumanity itself.~THE ONLY WAY TO VICTORYApril 1942I have been working with A.A.B. as my amanuensis since November 1919. Duringthat period the world has seen great and significant changes, and one of themost significant has been the growth—the phenomenal growth—[339] of spiritualperception. This shows itself in the fact that, in spite of the worldcatastrophe, in spite of the rampant horror and evil which is stalking ourplanet, and in spite of human pain, terror, suspense and uncertainty, there aretoday two factors present in the human consciousness: the vision of a betterfuture and a fixed, unalterable determination to make that vision fact in humanexperience. This better world is to be a world in which the spiritual valueswill control, viewing those values as that which is good and right for the wholeof humanity and not simply as religious and theological interpretations.Spiritual perception has become inclusive and now concerns the physical plane aswell as the metaphysical.It is not perhaps easy for you to realise the importance of this developmentwhich—again in the face of all contending forces—has enabled men to recognisethat the Kingdom of God must function on Earth; that it must be externalised andthat it need not be some distant point of wishful thinking but should conditionman’s daily life and control all his planning for the future. For this, men aretoday working and fighting. They call the vision by many names: better worldconditions, the new world order, world reconstruction, the new civilisation,brotherhood, fellowship, world federation, international understanding—itmatters not. It is the theme of betterment, of universal welfare, of generalsecurity, of widespread opportunity, irrespective of race, colour or creed. Thisis the factor of importance. The underlying purposes of God are working out, andwith this note I seek to begin my Wesak communication to you.This is the hopeful and most important side from the angle of the Hierarchy Whoview all world events from the angle of the future. There is, however, the otherside. It is not necessary for me to emphasise the seriousness of the presentsituation. The war is not yet won. At the time of writing, in spite of sporadicsuccesses and the staying power of the Allied Nations, and in spite of a basictrend towards ultimate victory, the powers of evil have had things very muchtheir own way. They have triumphantly moved forward, [340] except in Russia.This was to be expected at first, because if evil is simply the dominance ofmatter and the negation of the spiritual values, it is obvious that on thematerial plane the line of least resistance is to be found for them. Theirinitial triumphing is, therefore, to be expected. The course of the war hithertohas demonstrated this. When the spiritually-minded people of the world, the menand women of goodwill, the idealists and the kindly, decent folk in every landcan bring to bear upon the physical plane the same unified determination and thesame united will-to-victory that the forces of evil have shown, then the Forcesof Light will assume the upper hand and control human affairs.The difficulty with which the Hierarchy was confronted in the effort to bringthis about was due to the fact that the condition of unity of objective, ofmethod and of interrelation had to be brought about without any infringement ofthe free will of the individual, group or nation. The occult law of spiritualfreedom had to be recognised and protected. No such recognition or safeguardinghinders the activities of the forces of evil. The will-to-power and anorganised, evil minority took control. Freedom of conscience and of action wasremoved, and the enforced submission of the majority to the will of a ruthlessminority brought about a spurious but temporarily most effective unity. This hasbeen lacking in the case of the United Nations, fighting for the Forces of Lightand on behalf of human freedom.Freedom, my brothers, can itself prove a limitation when it delays right action,when it centres attention upon the petty differences and the personalityinclinations of people and when it serves to prevent that unity of action whichcan win the war. It has been necessary for the leaders of the peoples to takevaluable time to bring them to a proper sense of values and to the realisationthat individual and national differences and points of political and religiousdisagreement must all give place to the one supreme requirement—the winning ofthe war and the releasing of humanity from the threatened slavery, the steadilymounting fear, and the world domination of the Black Lodge.[341] As I have earlier told you, an ancient conflict is again in full swing andhumanity has now the opportunity to settle it once and for all, and—for everafter—be free in a sense not hitherto known. This conflict falls into threestages:1. The stage of physical warfare in which we are now engaged and from whichthere is no escape.This requires the Will-to-victory.2. The stage of reorganising world affairs when the war is over. This shouldproperly fall into two phases:a. The establishing of right human relations during a prolonged armistice, ifpossible. This phase will prove in many ways as difficult as the war itself, butwill work out on mental and emotional levels of warfare, instead of physical.b. The task of rehabilitation. This will be both physical and spiritual in scopeand will embrace those activities which stretch all the way from the rebuildingof blasted cities, the restoration of the scorched earth, the psychological careof the youth, the sick in mind and the bewildered, and the re-enunciation of theessential spiritual values which must guide humanity in the future.This will involve the Will-to-good.3. The stage wherein will come the recognition of the opportunities of peace,the right use of security, and the planned education of the youth of all landsin the principles of the new age.This will involve the Will-to-organise.Thus on all three levels of human living, mankind will be conditioned by atendency towards the good, the beautiful and the true. Speaking esoterically,the personality of humanity will be integrated and reoriented towards the good[342] life, a new and better way. For the attainment of these objectives, Isummon you today and all whom you can reach.I should like to incorporate at this point part of what I said elsewhere.One thing you must constantly bear in mind. When the war is over, when this timeof acute trial and tribulation have come to an end, a great spiritual awakening(of a quality and a nature quite unpredictable now) will arrive. The war willhave taught humanity many lessons and will have torn the veil of self away frommany eyes. Values which have been hitherto expressed and understood only bythose whose “eyes are on God,” will be the goal and the desire of untoldthousands; true understanding between men and between nations will be alonged-for objective, and what humanity determines to have it ever succeeds inachieving. This is an occult law, for desire is, as yet, the strongest force inthe world; organised , unified desire has been the basic reason for theappalling Axis successes.The only factor which can successfully oppose desire is Will, using the word inits spiritual connotation and as an expression of the first great divine aspect.There has been but little of that organised, spiritual will shown by the UnitedNations; the Allies are animated naturally by desire for victory, desire for thearrival of the end of this all-engulfing world cataclysm, by desire for peaceand the return of stability, the desire to end war once and for all and to breakits constantly recurring cycle, and a steadily mounting desire to bring to afinish the terrible toll of suffering, of cruelty, of death, of starvation andof fear which is gripping humanity by the throat in the attempt to strangle outits life.But all this determination is in most cases simply the expression of a fixed andunited desire. It is not the organised use of the will. The secret of the willlies in the recognition of the divine nature of man. Only this can evoke thetrue expression of the will. It has in fact to be evoked by the soul, as itdominates the human mind and controls the [343] personality. The secret of thewill is also closely tied in with the recognition of the unconquerable nature ofgoodness and the inevitability of the ultimate triumph of good. This is notdetermination; it is not whipping up and stimulating desire so that it can betransmuted into will; it is not an implacable, unshakable, immovable focussingof all energies in the need to triumph (the enemies of the Forces of Light areadept at that). Victory for the United Nations does not lie in the effort toproduce this focussing with better effect than the enemy. The use of the will isnot expressed by an iron fixation to stand steady and not yield to evil forces.Determination, the focussing of energy and the demonstration of an all-outeffort towards victory are only (where the United Nations are concerned) theexpression of a one-pointed desire for peace and for an ending of the trouble.This type of effort is something which the masses can give, and which they dogive on both sides in this conflict.There is, however, a plus, a something else, which will swing the tide ofvictory on to the side of the United Nations. This will come through the effortto understand and express the quality of spiritual Will; it will be themanifestation of that energy which makes the first divine aspect of Will orPower what it is; it is that which is the distinctive feature of the Shamballaforce; it is that peculiar and distinctive quality of divinity which is sodifferent that even Christ Himself was unable to express it with facility andunderstanding. Hence we have the episode in Gethsemane. It is not easy for me toexpress its significance in words. Two thousand years have gone since Gethsemaneand since Christ made His initial contact with the Shamballa force, and by thismeans and on behalf of humanity established a relationship which even after twothousand years is but a thin, frail line of connecting energy.This Will force is nevertheless available for right usage, but the power toexpress it lies in its understanding (as far as may be possible at this midwaypoint in human evolution), and in its group use. It is a unifying, syntheticforce, but can be used as a regimenting, standardising force. May [344] I repeatthose two key words to the use of this Shamballa energy: Group Use andUnderstanding.Mankind has had much difficulty in comprehending the significance of Love. Ifthat is so, the problem in relation to the Will will naturally be still moredifficult. For the vast majority of men, true love is still only a theory. Love(as we usually interpret it) works out as kindness, but it is kindness to theform side of life, to the personalities of those around us, and fulfils itselfusually in a desire to carry out our obligations and not to obstruct in any waythose activities and relationships which tend to the well-being of ourfellowmen. It expresses itself in a desire to end abuses and to bring abouthappier, material world conditions; it shows itself in mother love, in loveamong friends, but seldom as yet in love among groups and nations. It is thetheme of the Christian teaching, just as Will, divinely expressed, will be thetheme of the coming world religion, and has been the impulse lying behind muchof the good work done in the fields of philanthropy and human welfare, butfactually, true love has never yet been expressed—except by the Christ.You might ask why, if this is so, do you emphasise this highest aspect? Why notwait until we know more about Love and how to manifest it in our environment?Because, in its true expression, the Will today is needed as a propelling,expulsive force, and also as a clarifying, purifying agent.The Shamballa energy is therefore that which is related to the livingness(through consciousness and form) of humanity; we need not consider its relationto the rest of the manifested world; it concerns the establishing of right humanrelations and is that condition of being which eventually negates the power ofdeath. It is therefore incentive and not impulse; it is realised purpose and notthe expression of desire. Desire works from and through the material formupwards ; Will works downwards into form, bending form consciously to divinepurpose. The one is invocative and the other is evocative. Desire, when massedand focussed, can invoke will; will, when evoked, ends desire [345] and becomesan immanent, propulsive, driving force, stabilising, clarifying, and finallydestroying. It is much more than this, but this is all that man can grasp atthis time and all for which he has, as yet, the mechanism of comprehension. Itis this Will—aroused by invocation—which must be focussed in the light of thesoul and dedicated to the purposes of light, and for the purpose of establishingright human relations; it must be used (in love) to destroy all that ishindering the free flow of human life and which is bringing death (spiritual andreal) to humanity. This Will must be invoked and evoked.There are two great handicaps to the free expression of the Will force in itstrue nature. One is the sensitivity of the lower nature to its impact, and itsconsequent prostitution to selfish ends, as in the case of the sensitive,negative German people and its use by the Axis nations for material objectives.The second is the blocking, hindering, muddled but massed opposition of thewell-meaning people of the world who talk vaguely and beautifully about love butrefuse to consider the techniques of the Will of God in operation . According tothem, that Will is something with which they will personally have naught to do;they refuse to recognise that God works out His Will through men, just as He isever seeking to express His Love through men; they will not believe that thatWill could possibly express itself through the destruction of evil with all thematerial consequences of that evil. They cannot believe that a God of Love couldpossibly employ the first divine aspect to destroy the forms which areobstructing the free play of the divine Spirit; that Will must not infringe upontheir interpretation of Love. Such people are individually of small moment andof no importance, but their massed negativity is a real detriment to the endingof this war, just as the massed negativity of the German people, and theirinability to take right action when Hitler’s purposes were disclosed, madepossible the great inflow of ancient and focussed evil which has brought thepresent catastrophe to man. Such people are like a millstone around the neck ofhumanity, crippling true effort, murmuring, [346] “Let us love God and eachother,” but doing nothing but murmur prayers and platitudes whilst humanity isdying.You can easily appreciate the fact that the evocation of the energy of the Willand its effect upon the unprepared, materialistically minded person might andwould prove a disaster. It would simply serve to focus and strengthen the lowerself-will, which is the name we give to realised and determined desire. It couldthen create such a driving force, directed to selfish ends, that the personmight become a monster of wickedness. In the history of the race, one or twoadvanced personalities have done this with dire results, both to themselves andto the people of their time. One such figure in ancient times was Nero; themodern example is Hitler. What, however, has made the latter so dangerously anenemy of the human family is that during the last two thousand years mankind hasadvanced to a point where it can also be responsive to certain aspects of thisfirst ray force. Hitler therefore found associates and cooperators who addedtheir receptivity to his so that an entire group became the responsive agents ofthe destructive energy, expressing itself in its lowest aspect. This is what hasenabled them to work ruthlessly, powerfully, selfishly, cruelly, andsuccessfully, at the destruction of all that attempted to impede their projectsand desires.There is only one way in which this focussed evil will which is responsive tothe Shamballa force can be overcome, and that is by the opposition of an equallyfocussed spiritual Will, displayed by responsive men and women of goodwill whocan train themselves to be sensitive to this type of new incoming energy and canlearn how to invoke and evoke it.You can consequently see why there was more than the casual use of a currentword in my mind when I talked to all of you in terms of goodwill and of thewill-to-good. All the time I had in my thoughts not just kindness and goodintention, but the focussed will-to-good which can and must evoke the Shamballaenergy, and use it for the arresting of the forces of evil. [347]~THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WESAK FESTIVALMay 1942We have now reached the most important moment of the year. This year two suchmoments are brought together, reinforcing each other, the Full Moon of May andthe Full Moon of June. I would have you bear in mind that time and energy areinterchangeable terms upon the inner planes. Time is an event, and an event is afocussed expression of force of some type or kind. Two great streams ofenergy—one focussed through the Buddha and the other focussed through theChrist—are to be fused and blended and it is the task of the world disciples,the initiates and the accepted disciples to precipitate this combined energy onto the waiting world where its effective use will be largely dependent upon thesensitive response of the world aspirants. These are to be found in everycountry and their task is to react to the stream of directed energy. These arethe points I would have you bear in mind as you endeavour to work through and inthe ashram; in that ashram are to be found all types of disciples with all typesand degrees of responsiveness.There is an increasing emphasis being given in the West by esotericists to theFull Moon of May, which is the Festival of the Buddha and is held at the timewhen He makes His annual contact with humanity. This emphasis, which willcontinue to increase for years to come, has not been brought about in order toimpose recognition of the Buddha upon the Occident. There have been two mainreasons why, since 1900, this effort has been made. One was the desire on thepart of the Hierarchy to bring to the attention of the public the fact of thetwo Avatars, the Buddha and the Christ, both upon the second Ray of Love-Wisdom,Who were the first of our humanity to come forth as human-divine Avatars and toembody in Themselves certain cosmic Principles and give them form. The Buddhaembodied the Principle of Light, and because of this illumination, humanity wasenabled to recognise Christ, Who embodied the still greater Principle [348] ofLove. The point to be borne in mind is that light is substance, and the Buddhademonstrated the consummation of substance-matter as the medium of Light, henceHis title of the “Illumined One.” Christ embodied the underlying energy ofConsciousness. The one demonstrated the height of the attainment of the thirddivine aspect; the other that of the second aspect, and these two togetherpresent one perfect Whole. The second reason was to initiate, as I have earliersaid, the theme of the new world religion. This theme will eventually underlieall religious observances, colour all approaches to the divine centre ofspiritual life, give the clue to all healing processes, and—using lightscientifically—govern all techniques for bringing about conscious unity andrelationship between a man and his soul, and between humanity and the Hierarchy.The first objective has been definitely reached. Today, at the Full Moon of May,many millions everywhere will be turning their thoughts towards the Buddha,seeking to come under His influence and blessing and that of the Hierarchy atHis annual, though brief, return to bless humanity. This recognition will growuntil the time in the not too distant future when His term of service will beover and He will return no more, because the coming Avatar will take His placein the minds and thoughts of the peoples of the world. His task of remindingaspirants continuously of the possibility of illumination, and His work ofkeeping a channel open for the light to irradiate men’s minds by piercingannually through light substance to the Earth is nearly completed; the time hasnearly come when “in that light we shall see Light.”I would ask you to ponder on these two functions which the Buddha has performed.There is a third which, in collaboration with the Christ, He has made possible;this is the establishment of a more easily achieved relation between theHierarchy and Shamballa, thus facilitating the impress of the Will of God uponthe minds of men, through the medium of the Hierarchy. This impress we interpretas yet in terms of the divine Plan. This is expressing itself at present in the[349] keen recognition by men everywhere of the need to establish right humanrelations, culminating in the objectives for which the United Nations arefighting. These have been voiced for humanity by two great world disciples interms of The Four Freedoms and The Atlantic Pact. These Four Freedoms relatebasically to the four aspects of the lower self, the quaternary. Enough lighthas been permitted to penetrate by the efforts of the Buddha, to lead to aworld-wide recognition of the desirability of these formulas; and there isenough love already in the world, released by the Christ, to make possible theworking out of the formulas. Rest back on that assurance and—in full practiceupon the physical plane—demonstrate its truth. I said “to make possible,” forthe working out lies in the hands of the New Group of World Servers and the menand women of goodwill. Will they prove adequate for the task? Will they bracethemselves for the needed strenuous effort?What now is the task which the Buddha has set Himself this coming Full Moon? Asfar as your comprehension is concerned, it is to evoke in humanity the spirit ofdemand, whilst holding open for them the channel whereby that demand can reachstraight through to Shamballa. This is the point to have in mind as you preparefor the Wesak Festival and attempt to participate in the Full Moonblessing—blessing for the world and not for yourself. The Buddha comes thisyear, embodying the force which can stimulate men everywhere to focus their“massed intent” and thus reach symbolically “the ear and the heart” of theAvatar, wresting thus from the secret place of the Most High the aid, help, anddirected recognition which will bring about a phenomenal event in due and propertime. Whilst He is attempting to do this, the Christ will join in the effort byfocussing in Himself the spirit of appeal as it is evoked by the stimulationbeing applied by the Buddha. He will embody that appeal in a great Invocation,one which cannot be given to you, but which He is prepared to use if the appealcomes forth in sufficient strength from the people of the world. Will humanityrespond to the evocation of the [350] Buddha? Will their massed intent be vitalenough to enable the Christ to become Himself, in a mysterious way, the verySpirit of Invocation on their behalf? These are the possibilities with which weare confronted this Full Moon of May.It is these which I would ask you to have in mind from now until the Wesak Moonand on until after the June Full Moon. It is at that Full Moon that the Christcan and will use this Invocation, provided the will of the people permits. Atthat time He will attempt to reach the Lords of Liberation and evoke Theirresponse to the focussed will of the spiritually minded people of the world, theaspirants, disciples and initiates; They, if evoked, can give the impetus whichwill enable the Christ (as the Rider from the Secret Place) to come forth inresponse to the “massed intent” of the general public.Do you see, therefore, the imminent and vital possibilities? Do you recognisethe urgency of the opportunity? The two Full Moons form one complete cycle ofwork and should be prepared for in line with these statements of mine, both nowand in the years which will follow. As you prepare your own hearts, rememberthat the Full Moon of May is the time in which the New Group of World Serversand all the esotericists and spiritually oriented people of the world must workin full cooperation with the Buddha, and that the Full Moon of June is theopportunity for the men and women of goodwill—aided by the New Group of WorldServers—to arouse people everywhere to make a great appeal, and by this appealenable the Christ to invoke for them the needed aid.One thing I would request. Set no dates for the appearing of the Coming One, theAvatar, or for any spectacular aid. If the work is rightly done, He will come atthe set and appointed time and the needed aid will be forthcoming. Modes andmethods are none of your concern. Regard the ancient prophecies as intrinsicallyright, true and correct, but recognise that their phraseology is symbolic andnot to be taken literally. How the Lords of Liberation will work can only beknown to the Hierarchy. Their aid will be focussed [351] upon evoking in theHierarchy those attitudes and capacities which will make possible the inflow ofenergy from Shamballa. Their work is with the Hierarchy, and the reaction ofhumanity to Their activity will come only from the New Group of World Servers,and may even then only be registered consciously by the senior disciples andinitiates.The work of the Avatar, the Rider from the Secret Place, will be primarily withhumanity and will be for their relief and salvation.The first half of this work, focussed through the Buddha, will begin in May1942. The second half will be started by the Christ in June 1942, but only ifthe invocation of the New Group of World Servers and the massed intent of themen and women of goodwill is adequately strong and adequately focussed. It willconsequently be a reciprocal process of invocation and evocation, facilitated bythe extreme readiness to act and to respond on the part of Those invoked byhumanity, but handicapped by the lack of sensitivity and the weakness of thewill of those seeking aid. It is this inadequacy which the Buddha hopes toremove when He comes to His people in May. It is the strengthening and focussingof the will which the Christ is endeavouring to foster with a special effort inJune.These two Full Moons are therefore of paramount importance and should have adefinite effect subconsciously upon the minds of the New Group of World Serversand upon the hearts of the men and women of goodwill in every land, nation andgroup. Let your meetings, your meditation and your individual thinking besteadily focussed upon these points, and endeavour to enter into the Full Moonexercises—both of May and June—with as clear an understanding of what is takingplace as you can and a clear picture of the possibilities which can come as theresult of right action. Both the Full Moons should be times of effectiveservice. The Buddha does not require invoking. He will come. But the spirit ofinvocation needs evoking from the masses and it is this work that aspirantseverywhere can aid the Buddha in bringing out, standing thus with Him and withthe [352] Hierarchy. At the time of the Full Moon of June, and in preparationfor the opportunity during the entire month of May, the point of focus for allservers must be the Christ and every effort must be directed to aiding His workas Representative for the people. He will endeavour to gather into Himself allthat they have of appeal, prayer and demand—voiced or unvoiced—transmitting itin an act of spiritual intent to Shamballa.A mobilising of the Forces of Light is going on upon the inner side of life.These Forces stand ready, but the word for action must come from the Christ, andHe will give that word when the people give it to Him. We are the conditionersof our own destiny. Neither the Christ nor the Hierarchy may, at this stage inhuman evolution, take any step vitally affecting humanity unless released intothis activity by humanity itself.From April 15th till June 15th are critical weeks, spiritually and materially,and this is one of the important facts I want at this time to bring to yourattention. I cannot detail to you what you should do or what should be your lineof endeavour. I can give you a general idea of the hierarchical Approach and thenature of the human problem. The rest lies in your hands.Even if the work done is entirely successful, the time of the Appearing and ofdivine intervention by the Forces of Light, through the medium of Their Agents,the Lords of Liberation and the Christ is dependent upon many factors besidethat of right invocation. Of these you can know little, if anything. Thequestion of right timing is one of deep esoteric significance and is basicallyinvolved here. The next three years are years of fulfilment and for that periodthe aspirants of the world are asked to stand steady in patient, yet convinced,expectancy. The task to be done by the Hierarchy involves not only the physicalplane but also the inner planes of causes and impulses, of thought and desire.This all disciples know but are apt to forget. The critical situation upon theouter plane is only a reflection of still more critical inner conditions, andyou can give acceptable [353] help if you evoke your own will and control youremotions, disciplining your personality. Thus you will be able to present a tinyfocal point through which the spiritual Forces can work. Through the agency ofthe many tiny points of light and will, much potency can be transmitted.It is the will-to-victory that is demanded at this time; it is thewill-to-invoke that which is needed; it is the will-to-focus and through thisfocussing to aid in the great act of invocation for which the Christ is at thistime preparing Himself; it is the will-to-goodness, to self-control and to theevocation of right action for which the Hierarchy asks today. If humanity doesits part, it will find that Hierarchy more than ready to respond and do itsshare in bringing about world release from the Forces of Evil.Will you ponder on this and will you cooperate in every possible way? The plansmay be laid, the vision may be seen but unless everyone recognises his essentialcontribution and his real usefulness, nothing can be done. There are nolimitations when true esoteric work is undertaken. To this end, I seek toemphasise renewed application to meditation and a constant steady use of theInvocation, particularly the one which begins by invoking the Lords ofLiberation.“This work,” Christ said, “goeth not forth save by prayer and fasting.” I callyou to prayer and to meditation for both are needed today, fusing as they do theemotional and mental bodies into one aspiring whole. I call you to discipline,for that is the meaning of fasting and to the constant effort to live at thehighest possible point all the time; this is so often a dream but not often afact. Today, in the hour of the world’s need, aspirants and disciples who arewilling to make at least consistent, persistent effort are needed by humanityand the Hierarchy.My brothers, I have presented the picture; I have held before you for years thevision of opportunity, service and discipleship. I have outlined to you themechanism of service which already is in existence and which can be galvanisedinto activity and world usefulness. I leave the matter in your hands, asking youto remember that the united [354] interest, love, service and money of the manyis far more potent than even the consecrated effort of the two or three. No oneis futile or useless, unless he chooses so to be.And in the meantime, paralleling your subjective work and externalising yourinner endeavour must be your work for your country and for your fellowmen inhumanity’s hour of need. There must be steadiness, selflessness and silence,plus courage and confidence—confidence in the strength of your own souls,confidence in the watching Hierarchy and confidence in the Plan. The end oftribulation is not yet, but it is in sight. With this thought I leave you. Maythe blessing of the Masters rest upon you as a group and as individuals, and maythe Holy Ones Whose pupils you seek to become show you the light you seek, giveyou the strong aid of Their compassion and Their wisdom until you stand wherethe One Initiator is invoked, until you see His star shine forth.~THE CAUSE OF THE WORLD CATASTROPHEJune 1942We come now to the consideration of the present acute situation and worldcatastrophe which is rooted in world glamour, and will study the possibility ofrelief and cure. This possibility exists and is centred in the two greatAvatars, the Buddha and the Christ.It is difficult to write clearly about this matter of world glamour (Thismessage appears in the book “Glamour: A World Problem”. It is included here topreserve the historical sequence of the teaching in relation to world events.)because we are in the midst of its most concentrated expression—the worst theworld has ever seen because glamour, incident to centuries of greed andselfishness, of aggression and materialism, has been focussed in a triplicity ofnations. It is, therefore, easily to be seen and most effective inmanifestation. Three nations express the three aspects of world glamour(illusion, glamour and maya) in an amazing manner, and their powerful assaultupon the consciousness [355] of humanity is dependent not only upon the responseof Germany, Japan and Italy to this ancient miasma but also upon the fact thatevery nation—the United Nations as well as the Totalitarian Nations—are taintedwith this universal condition. The freedom of the world is consequently largelydependent upon those people in every nation who (within themselves) have movedforward out of one or other of these “glamorous illusions of mayavicimpressions” of the human soul into a state of awareness wherein they can seethe conflict in its wider terms, i.e., as that existing for them between theDweller on the Threshold and the Angel of the Presence.These people are the aspirants, the disciples and the initiates of the world.They are aware of the dualism, the essential dualism, of the conflict and arenot so pre-eminently conscious of the threefold nature and the differentiatedcondition of the situation which underlies the realised dualism. Their approachto the problem is therefore simpler and, because of this, world direction lieslargely in their hands at this time.It is right here that religion has, as a whole, gone astray. I refer to orthodoxreligion. It has been preoccupied with the Dweller on the Threshold and the eyesof the theologian have been held upon the material, phenomenal aspect of lifethrough fear and its immediacy, and the fact of the Angel has been a theory anda point of wishful thinking. The balance is being adjusted by the humanitarianattitudes which are so largely coming into control, irrespective of anytheological trend. These attitudes take their stand upon belief in the innaterightness of the human spirit, in the divinity of man and upon theindestructible nature of the soul of mankind. This inevitably brings in theconcept of the PRESENCE, or of God Immanent and is the result of the neededrevolt against the one-sidedness of the belief in God Transcendent. Thisspiritual revolution was entirely a balancing process and need cause no basicconcern, for God Transcendent eternally exists, but can only be seen and knownand correctly approached by God Immanent—immanent [356] in individual man, ingroups and nations, in organised forms and in religion, in humanity as a wholeand in the planetary Life Itself. Humanity is today (and has been for ages)battling illusion, glamour and maya. Advanced thinkers, those upon theProbationary Path, upon the Path of Discipleship, and the Path of Initiationhave reached the point where materialism and spirituality, the Dweller on theThreshold and the Angel of the Presence, and the basic dualism of manifestationcan be seen clearly defined. Because of this clarity of demarcation, the issuesunderlying present world events, the objectives of the present world-widestruggle, the modes and methods of re-establishing the spiritual contact soprevalent in Atlantean days and so long lost, and the recognition of thetechniques which can bring in the new world era and its cultural order can beclearly noted and appraised.All generalisations admit of error. It might, however, be said that Germany hasfocussed in herself world glamour—the most potent and expressive of the threeaspects of glamour. Japan is manifesting the force of maya—the crudest form ofmaterial force. Italy, individualistic and mentally polarised, is the expressionof world illusion. The United Nations, with all their faults, limitations,weaknesses and nationalisms, are focussing the conflict between the Dweller andthe Angel, and thus the three forms of glamour and the final form of theconflict between the spiritual ideal and its material opponent are appearingsimultaneously. The United Nations are, however, gradually and most decisivelythrowing the weight of their effort and aspiration on to the side of the Angel,thus restoring the lost balance and slowly producing on a planetary scale thoseattitudes and conditions which will eventually dispel illusion, dissipateglamour and devitalise the prevalent maya. This they are doing by the increasedclear thinking of the general public of all the nations, bound together toconquer the three Axis Powers, by their growing ability to conceive ideas interms of the whole, in terms of a desirable world order or federation, [357] andtheir capacity to discriminate between the Forces of Light and the potency ofevil or materialism.The work being done by those who see the world stage as the arena for theconflict between the Dweller on the Threshold and the Angel of the PRESENCEmight be itemised as follows:1. The producing of those world conditions in which the Forces of Light canovercome the Forces of Evil. This they do by the weight of their armed forces,plus their clear insight.2. The educating of humanity in the distinction betweena. Spirituality and materialism, pointing to the differing goals of thecombatant forces.b. Sharing and greed, outlining a future world wherein The Four Freedoms will bedominant and all will have that which is needed for right living-processes.c. Light and dark, demonstrating the difference between an illumined future ofliberty and opportunity and the dark future of slavery.d. Fellowship and separation, indicating a world order where racial hatreds,caste distinctions and religious differences will form no barrier tointernational understanding, and the Axis order of master races, determinedreligious attitudes, and enslaved peoples.e. The whole and the part, pointing to the time which is approaching (under theevolutionary urge of spirit) wherein the part or the point of life assumes itsresponsibility for the whole, and the whole exists for the good of the part. Thedark aspect has been brought about by ages of glamour. The light is beingemphasised and made clear by the world aspirants and disciples who by theirattitudes, their actions, their writings and their utterances are bringing thelight into dark places.3. Preparing the way for the three spiritual energies which will sweep humanityinto an era of comprehension, leading [358] to a focussed mental clarificationof men’s minds throughout the world. These three imminent energies area. The energy of the intuition which will gradually dispel world illusion, andproduce automatically a great augmentation of the ranks of initiates.b. The activity of light which will dissipate, by the energy of illumination,the world of glamour and bring many thousands on to the Path of Discipleship.c. The energy of inspiration which will bring about, through the medium of itssweeping potency, the devitalisation or the removal, as by a wind, of theattractive power of maya or substance. This will release untold thousands on tothe Path of Probation.4. Releasing new life into the planet through the medium of every possibleagency. The first step towards this release is the proving that the power ofmaterialism is broken by the complete defeat of the Axis powers and, secondly,by the ability of the United Nations to demonstrate (when this has been done)the potency of the spiritual values by their constructive undertakings torestore world order and to lay those foundations which will guarantee a betterand more spiritual way of life. These constructive attitudes and undertakingsmust be assumed individually by every person, and by nations as collectivewholes. The first is being undertaken at this time. The second remains as yet tobe done.5. Bringing home to the nations of the world the truths taught by the Buddha,the Lord of Light, and the Christ, the Lord of Love. In this connection it mightbe pointed out that basically:a. The Axis nations need to grasp the teaching of the Buddha as He enunciated itin the Four Noble Truths; they need to realise that the cause of all sorrow andwoe is desire—desire for that which is material.b. The United Nations need to learn to apply the Law of Love as enunciated inthe life of Christ and to express the truth that “no man liveth unto himself”and no [359] nation either, and that the goal of all human effort is lovingunderstanding, prompted by a programme of love for the whole.If the lives and teachings of these two great Avatars can be comprehended andwrought out anew in the lives of men today, in the world of human affairs, inthe realm of human thinking and in the arena of daily living, the present worldorder (which is today largely disorder) can be so modified and changed that anew world and a new race of men can gradually come into being. Renunciation andthe use of the sacrificial will should be the keynote for the interim periodafter the war, prior to the inauguration of the New Age.Students need to remember that all manifestations and every point of crisis aresymbolised by the ancient symbol of the point within the circle, the focus ofpower within a sphere of influence or aura. So it is today with the entireproblem of ending the world glamour and illusion which fundamentally lie behindthe present acute situation and world catastrophe. The possibility of such adispelling and dissipation is definitely centred in the two Avatars, the Buddhaand the Christ.Within the world of glamour—the world of the astral plane and ofemotions—appeared a point of light. The Lord of Light, the Buddha, undertook tofocus in Himself the illumination which would eventually make possible thedissipation of glamour. Within the world of illusion—the world of the mentalplane—appeared the Christ, the Lord of Love Himself, Who embodied in Himself thepower of the attractive will of God. He undertook to dispel illusion by drawingto Himself (by the potency of love) the hearts of all men, and stated thisdetermination in the words, “And I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw allmen unto me.” (John 12:32). From the point they then will have reached, theworld of spiritual perception, of truth and of divine ideas will stand revealed.The result will be the disappearing of illusion.[360] The combined work of these two great Sons of God, concentrated through theworld disciples and through Their initiates must and will inevitably shatterillusion and dispel glamour—the one by the intuitive recognition of reality byminds attuned to it, and the other by the pouring in of the light of reason. TheBuddha made the first planetary effort to dissipate world glamour; the Christmade the first planetary effort towards the dispelling of illusion. Their workmust now be intelligently carried forward by a humanity wise enough to recogniseits dharma. Men are being rapidly disillusioned and will consequently see moreclearly. The world glamour is being steadily removed from the ways of men. Thesetwo developments have been brought about by the incoming new ideas, focussedthrough the world intuitives and released to the general public by the worldthinkers. It has been also largely aided by the well-nigh unconscious, but nonethe less real, recognition of the true meaning of these Four Noble Truths by themasses. Disillusioned and de-glamoured (if I may use such a term), humanityawaits the coming revelation. This revelation will be brought about by thecombined efforts of the Buddha and the Christ. All that we can foresee orforetell anent that revelation is that some potent and far-reaching results willbe achieved by the merging of light and love, and by the reaction of “lightedsubstance to the attractive power of love.” In this sentence I have given thosewho can understand a profound and useful hint as to the method and purpose ofthe undertaking staged for the June Full Moon, 1942. I have also given a clue tothe true understanding of the work of these Avatars—a thing hitherto quiteunrealised. It might be added that when an appreciation of the meaning of thewords “transfiguration of a human being” is gained, the realisation will comethat when “the body is full of light” then “in that light shall we see Light.”This means that when the personality has reached a point of purification, ofdedication and of illumination, then the attractive power of the soul (whosenature is love and understanding) can function, [361] and fusion of these twowill take place. This is what the Christ proved and demonstrated.When the work of the Buddha (or of the embodied buddhic principle) isconsummated in the aspiring disciple and in his integrated personality, then thefull expression of the work of the Christ (the embodied principle of love) canalso be consummated and both these potencies—light and love—will find radiantexpression in the transfigured disciple. What is true, therefore, of theindividual is true also of humanity as a whole, and today humanity (havingreached maturity) can “enter into realisation” and consciously take part in thework of enlightenment and of spiritual, loving activity. The practical effectsof this process will be the dissipation of glamour and the release of the humanspirit from the thraldom of matter; it will produce, also, the dispelling ofillusion and the recognition of truth as it exists in the consciousness of thosewho are polarised in the “awareness of the Christ.”This is necessarily no rapid process but is an ordered and regulated procedure,sure in its eventual success but relatively slow also in its establishment andsequential process. This process was initiated upon the astral plane by theBuddha, and on the mental plane when Christ manifested on Earth. It indicatedthe approaching maturity of humanity. The process has been slowly gatheringmomentum as these two great Beings have gathered around Them Their disciples andinitiates during the past two thousand years. It has reached a point ofintensive usefulness as the channel of communication between Shamballa and theHierarchy has been opened and enlarged, and as the contact between these twogreat Centres and Humanity has been more firmly established.At the June Full Moon, 1942, will come the first test as to the directness ofthe communication between the Centre where the Will of God holds sway, theCentre where the Love of God rules and the Centre where there is intelligentexpectancy. The medium of the test will be the united effort of the Christ, ofthe Buddha and of those who respond to [362] Their blended influence. This testhas to be carried out in the midst of the terrific onslaught of the powers ofevil and will be extended over the two weeks beginning on the day of the FullMoon (May 30th, 1942) and ending on June 15th, 1942. There is a greatconcentration of the Spiritual Forces at this time and the use of a specialInvocation (one which humanity itself may not use), but the success or failureof the test, in the last analysis, will be determined by mankind itself.You may feel, though wrongly, that not enough people know about or understandthe nature of the opportunity or what is transpiring. But the success of such atest is not dependent upon the esoteric knowledge of the few, the relativelyvery few, to whom the facts and the information have been partially imparted. Itis dependent also upon the tendency of the many who unconsciously aspire towardsthe spiritual realities, who seek for a new and better way of life for all, whodesire the good of the whole and whose longing and desire is for a trueexperience of goodness, of right human relations and of spiritual enterpriseamong men. Their name is legion and they are to be found in every nation.When the Will of God, expressed in Shamballa and focussed in the Buddha, theLove of God, expressed in the Hierarchy and focussed through the Christ, and theintelligent desire of humanity, focussed through the world disciples, the worldaspirants and the men of goodwill are all brought into line—either consciouslyor unconsciously—then a great reorientation can and will take place. This eventis something that can happen.The first result will be the illumination of the astral plane and the beginningof the process which will dissipate glamour; the second result will be theirradiation of the mental plane and the dispelling of all past illusions and thegradual revelation of the new truths of which all past ideals and so-calledformulations of truth have only been the sign-posts. Ponder on that statement.The sign-post indicates [363] the way to go; it does not reveal the goal. It isindicative but not conclusive. So with all truth up to the present time.The demand is, therefore, for knowers and for those whose minds and hearts areopen; who are free from preconceived ideas fanatically held, and from ancientidealisms which must be recognised as only partial indications of greatunrealised truths—truths which can be realised in great measure and for thefirst time if the lessons of the present world situation and the catastrophe ofthe war are duly learned and the sacrificial will is called into play.I have made this practical application and this immediate illustration ofteaching anent glamour, illusion and maya because the whole world problem hasreached a crisis today and because its clarification will be the outstandingtheme of all progress—educational, religious and economic—until 2025 A.D.Today, as humanity awaits the revelation which will embody the thoughts anddreams and constructive goal of the New Age, the demand comes for the first timefrom a large group of intuitively inclined people. I said not intuitives, mybrothers. This group is now so large and its focus is now so real and its demandso loud that it is succeeding in focussing the massed intent of the people.Therefore, whatever revelation may emerge in the immediate future will be better“protected by the spirit of understanding” than any previous one. This is thesignificance of the words in the New Testament, “Every eye shall see him”;humanity as a whole will recognise the Revealing One . In past ages theMessenger from on High was only recognised by and known to a mere handful ofmen, and it took decades and sometimes centuries for His message to penetrateinto the hearts of humanity.The stress of the times also and the development of the sense of proportion,plus an enforced return to simplicity of living and requirements may save thecoming revelation from too swift and quick a submergence in the fire of theGreat Illusion. [364]~THE INTERLUDE BETWEEN WAR AND PEACEAugust 1942There is an insistent demand from the many thousands who in the past have readthe pamphlets and articles which I have written, that I say something about thecoming period of rehabilitation, and of what can be done (whilst the war isstill in progress) to prepare for usefulness at that time. When the war brokeout, I published an article entitled The Present World Crisis, and in it triedto trace the origins of the conflict and the factors which made this catastrophepossible. Later, another article appeared, called The Coming World Order, whichsought to hold out to a suffering world a vision of a material and spiritualfuture which the hearts of men have long demanded. Thus an attempt was made todeal with both the past and the future.More at that time was not possible, owing to the disunity existing among thosenations which today form the United Nations. There was also a lack ofunderstanding and a selfish perspective among those nations at that timeneutral. Above everything else was the fact that the issues involved had to besettled by humanity itself and it was not then possible to foretell with anyaccuracy what humanity would do. Even the most enlightened of men and thespiritual leaders of the race could not judge what line mankind would take orwhether there were enough clear-sighted people in the world who could and wouldsweep the mass of men into effective opposition to the Axis Powers. The questionwas: Would world fear and universal selfishness dominate, or would the spirit offreedom and the love of liberty be strong enough to weld the free nations intoone united and steadfast whole?Today the issue is clear and the end inevitable. The free nations and thedefeated and enslaved little nations are subjectively and practically unifiedinto one intense spiritual determination to win the war; the fate of the AxisNations is therefore unalterably settled, even though, at this time of writing,they seem to be victorious all along [365] the line. It is only the time of thefinal victory of right against might which remains as yet the factor ofuncertainty, and this is owing to the enormous prepared strength of theaggressor nations and the unpreparedness of the democracies. This unpreparednessis being rapidly remedied.This article is an attempt to indicate the problems, and perhaps some of thesolutions, which must inevitably fill the interlude between the ending of thewar and the coming world order. It will be necessary to deal with this subjectin a broad and general way, for the subject is too vast for us to beintelligently specific. We can, however, consider the immediate work to be donein preparation for the cessation of war and indicate the first steps which canand should be taken to initiate sound reconstruction processes. The period ofrehabilitation and of reconstruction should be the deep concern today of all wholove their fellowmen.There are those who will consider the study of the coming reconstruction periodas premature. They believe (and rightly) that our first immediate concern is towin the war, and with this I am fully in agreement. The will-to-victory is thefirst and basic essential, for there will be no true reconstruction activity ifthe Axis nations triumph. But there are many today whose task is not that offighting and whose place and function is perforce in the civilian aspects of thelife of the nations. These can think, and talk, and work in preparation for thefuture. There are others who feel that only the trained expert in the fields ofeconomic and political readjustment can approach this difficult problem with anyhope of making a useful contribution. Still others feel that peace is the onlything that matters and that it should be followed by a long period of mentalquiet in every country; they believe that people everywhere are too exhaustedand unhappy to be ready as yet to undertake any work of rebuilding. Others againare so completely pessimistic that they despair of ever reclaiming the world,and they look sadly for a breakdown of all the civilised processes of living.There is some truth in all these points of view. The work of the experts will besorely needed, but [366] the understanding interest and the sustaining power ofthose whose hearts are aflame with love can alone make their work possible. Itwill not be the institutionalised activities and the financial enterprise ofeconomic and social workers and government agents which will alone be needed,but above all else, the solution must be found in the uprising of goodwill inthe hearts of men. This will provide the right compassionate incentive. Mostcertainly the world could be rehabilitated for purely commercial and selfishreasons, and because trade interchange, buying and selling capacity and therestoration of financial stability are important factors in world restoration.But these are not the basic motives which would restore humanity toself-respecting and secure living. They will provide the motive power for manymen and groups, but not the motive which can produce true constructiverebuilding of the fabric of human life.The work of reconstruction will be the work of the intelligent men and women ofgoodwill, and theirs will be the task to restore new life and happiness tohumanity, and it is for them I write. Please bear this in mind. I am not writingfor technical experts and trained advisors to the government, but to those whohave goodwill in their hearts to all men, and who, because of it, want to dotheir share in bringing tranquillity and peace to the world—a peace based onsurer values than in the past and upon sounder planning. In the last analysis,it is not peace for which the men of goodwill are working, but for the growth ofthe spirit of understanding and cooperation; this alone will be strong enough tobreak down racial barriers, heal the wounds of war, and build a new worldstructure adequate to the intelligent demands of the masses.In the earlier pamphlets, I sought (along with many other thinking people) toindicate the steps which might be taken to avert the impending cataclysm. Amongthe most important upon which emphasis was laid was the growth of worldgoodwill, for goodwill is the active principle of peace. I sought also to stressinternational understanding, a future of shared planetary resources, and arecognition of [367] a general historically-proved guilt in relation to the war,plus those ideas which could—if developed—end the era of separativeness.In spite of all the efforts of the men of goodwill, of all the peaceorganisations, and the enlightened work of the world thinkers, educators andleaders, two things happened which it had been hoped might be averted. The firstwas a definite and focussed precipitation of the spirit of evil and ofmaterialism through the medium of the Axis nations, using the aggression ofJapan as the initial focal point and expressing itself later in full forcethrough Germany. The second was the failure of the neutral nations, in the earlystages of the war, to take the needed steps to ally themselves actively with thenations fighting totalitarianism, and their inability to realise the full horrorof what lay ahead for mankind. The selfishness of humanity was even moredeep-seated than was grasped, and the United Nations came into cooperativeactivity only after two years of war and the planned rape of many of the neutralnations. The blindness of the neutral nations definitely upset the calculationsof far-sighted workers for world good and seriously delayed the ending of thewar.The critical point is now passed, and the humanitarian grasp of the issuesinvolved, and the unity existing among the Allied Nations, guarantee theinevitable defeat of the Axis Powers. Other factors also ensure the ultimatevictory of the forces of right and the freedom of the world. There is not timeto enlarge upon them, but they can be listed and people can then see howassuredly they guarantee the triumph of the free peoples of the world. Thesefactors are:1. The will-to-victory is steadily growing. Appeasement, pacifism anduncertainty are as steadily dying out.2. The plight of humanity everywhere, as the result of Axis aggression, isdefinitely steadying public opinion and evoking an unalterable determination toend the evil initiated and carried forward by Germany and Japan, aided somewhatunwillingly by Italy. [368]3. The resources of the United Nations are vast and are now in process ofmobilisation. Their massed use and their manufacturing potential are practicallyinexhaustible and are rapidly being organised. The man power and the resourcesof Germany and of her allies have reached their peak, bringing enormous presentpotency, but a steady decline is indicated for the future.4. The issues in this war are being increasingly clearly realised; even theignorant and the prejudiced recognise today that these issues can be groupedunder three major positions, and this enables them to make a personal choice asto loyalties.a. The democratic position, with its emphasis upon the Four Freedoms and theAtlantic Charter, ensuring right human relations and the ending of aggression.b. The totalitarian position, with its emphasis upon world dictatorship, theslavery of the many conquered nations, its anti-racial bias and its blatantcruelty and terrorism.c. The appeasement and the pacifist attitudes—idealistic and impractical andfinding their focus today in the attitude of Gandhi. He brings into clearperspective the uncompromising, fanatical attitude which is non-realistic andwhich will willingly sacrifice lives, nations and the future of humanity inorder to attain its object. If Gandhi were to succeed in his objective now , itwould precipitate civil war in India, sacrifice all immediate hope of freedomfor that country, permit the Japanese to realise an easy conquest of India,bring about a slaughtering of countless thousands, and permit Germany to joinhands with Japan across Asia, with the appalling probability of a totalitarianvictory.These three points of view are today being clearly realised by men everywhere,and their decisions as to loyalties and adherences are clarified.5. The spirit of freedom is triumphing in every land (even in the conqueredcountries, much to the bewilderment of [369] Germany), and the beauty of thehuman spirit is emerging everywhere, both in the conquered lands and in thenations fighting, with their backs to the wall, for human liberty.6. An intense interest in after-war conditions is evidenced by the utterances ofleaders, politicians, lecturers and the spiritually minded men everywhere; thisis testified to by the articles, pamphlets, books, speeches and plans dealingwith the new world order. The forces of rehabilitation and of goodwill arerapidly mobilising; they constitute a great army within all nations, and theyare an invisible army, but one which is as yet inchoate, uncertain as to methodand process, though clear as to goals and principles.The above six factors ensure the defeat of the Forces of Evil and the triumph ofthe Forces of Light, and with these as the basis of optimism we can look aheadwith sure hope to the ending of the war, to the demobilisation of the armies, tothe tranquil passage of the seven seas and to the time when fear begins to dieout.What then will be the dangers to be offset? For what must we be prepared whenthe task of reconstruction confronts us? It might be useful to enumerate some ofthe dangers for which we must be prepared. Let us consider them in the order oftheir importance:1. The danger of too prompt a peace settlement. Let us work hard for a prolongedarmistice, during which the heat of battle and the fires of revenge can havetime to die down, the agony of mankind can be assuaged, and time be gained forcalm, unhurried planning.2. The danger of a return to so-called normality . The outstanding disasterwhich faces humanity at this time is a return to the state of affairs prior tothe outbreak of war, and the rehabilitation of the old familiar world, with itsimperialism (whether of empire or finance), its nationalisms and its distressed,exploited minorities, its vile distinctions and separative barriers between richand poor, between [370] the oriental and the occidental, and between the castesand classes which are found in every land—without any exception.3. The dangers incident to the necessary adjustments between the nations. Anyadjustment made upon the basis of historical tradition or ancient boundarieswill only serve to plunge the world again into war. These adjustments must becarried out on the basis of humanity itself; the will of free peoples must bethe determining factor and not the will of technical, political experts, or ofsome ruling class or group. In the world which is coming, the human equationwill take a predominant position; human beings will determine, as far as in themlies, their own destiny and men will exercise their free will in establishingthe kind of world in which they choose to live. They will decide in whichcountry they prefer to claim citizenship and the type of government to whichthey choose to give allegiance. This will necessarily all take time and must bean unhurried process. It will call for a planned education of the masses inevery country; and the principles of freedom, and the distinction betweenfreedom and license, will have to be carefully taught. A new world based uponthe restoration of territorial limits, historically determined, will fail to endstrife, aggression and fear. A new world based on human values and right humanrelations can institute (slowly to be sure, but inevitably) that newcivilisation which men of goodwill demand for humanity as a whole.4. The dangers growing out of hate, revenge and pain. These dangers will be themost difficult to avoid. A deep-seated hatred of the Nazi regime (and of theGerman nation as endorsing that regime) is steadily rising. This is almostinevitable, being based on the facts of Nazi activity. The task of the UnitedNations after the war will of necessity be—among other things—to protect theGerman people from the hate of those whom they have so appallingly abused. Thiswill be no easy thing to do. Retribution and revenge must not be permitted, andyet at the same time a just payment for evil action cannot, and should not, be[371] avoided . The law ever works, and that law states that whatsoever a man ornation sows, that shall it also reap. Germany has sown evil broadcast throughoutthe civilised world, and for some time to come her lot must be hard and she willhave to pay in sweat and toil and tears for her evil deeds. But this paymentshould be part of the great work of rehabilitation and not a vengeful exaction,and if this is borne in mind, no serious mistakes will be made. The Germanpeople must work strenuously to put right the evil they have done, as far as inthem lies, but the next generation—at present in the cradle or at school—mustnot be penalised. The little children and the babies of the German race—innocentof the wrong actions of their fathers and brothers—should not be implicated inthe penalties exacted. The young men of today in Germany must, by the labour oftheir hands and the sweat of their brows, rebuild that which they have soruthlessly destroyed, but the unoffending, though weak, elderly people, thelittle children and the adolescent boys and girls must be exempt and must betrained to be citizens of a better and a finer Germany than has ever yetexisted—a Germany that is a constructive part of the whole and not a menace anda terror to all right-thinking men. The arousing of the men of goodwill in everynation—men who see humanity as a whole and all men as brothers—is the only wayin which this rising tide of hate can be stemmed. It will not be stemmed bytelling those who have suffered at the hands of the Axis nations that they mustnot hate, or by exhorting people who have been the victims of traitors that theymust not bear ill-will to such men as Quisling and Laval. It will be offset by agreat demonstration of practical love and understanding on the part of theUnited Nations—a love which will work out in the form of food for the hungry,nursing for the sick, the rebuilding of the ruined cities, and the restorationof the “scorched earth.” The problems of hate and revenge will require theutmost skill in handling and will necessitate exceedingly wise action on thepart of the free nations. [372]5. The danger to humanity of the effects of war upon the children and theadolescents of the nations. The children of today are the parents of the cominggenerations, and they have been through a shattering psychological experience.They can scarcely ever be truly normal again. They have seen the very depths ofcruelty, wickedness, pain, horror, terror and uncertainty. They have beenbombed, shell-shocked and machine-gunned. They have known no security and lookforward today to no sure future. Millions have known no parental control; theyhave been separated by war from their families and frequently do not even knowtheir own names. Even when the family unit has been preserved intact, theirfathers are usually engaged in war work, either at home or abroad, and theirmothers are working in factories or on the land; the children have therefore nohome life or control. Malnutrition has weakened their stamina and rampant evilhas undermined their morale and their standards of value. From the humanitarianand spiritual standpoint, the vital problem after the war will be therestoration of the children of the world to happiness, security, properstandards of life and conduct and some measure of understanding control. This isessentially a problem of education. Educators and psychologists of vision inevery country must be mobilised and the “pattern of things to come” for thechildren must be intelligently determined. This will have to be done on aninternational scale and with the wisdom which comes from a grasp of immediateneed and a far-sighted vision.6. The dangers of re-emergence of the nationalist spirit. Intense nationalismwas one of the prime movers in bringing about this war and no nation has beenexempt from this spirit of national pride and from a nationalistic, separativeoutlook. Selfish interests have controlled the reasons for which every nationhas entered this war; individual security has prompted the entry of even themost enlightened democratic nations. That to these selfish incentives they haveadded world need and the love of freedom is true and serves [373] to balance,though not offset, the selfish motives; that the instinct of self-preservationgave them no alternative is likewise true, but the fact remains that there wouldhave been no war if the democratic nations had been the determining factor .That in itself gives rise to questions. Why did the powerful democracies, in thelast analysis, permit this war when, united and banded together from the start,they might have arrested it in the initial stages? Also, given the existentaggressor nations, collective self-interest forced the democracies into combat,and yet this same self-interest should have made them take the steps which wouldhave guaranteed the peace. National types, individual national interests,national cultures and national civilisations exist side by side, but instead ofbeing regarded as contributory to one integrated whole, they have been zealouslycompetitive and have been regarded as the peculiar and distinctive prerogativesof some one nation and as existing for the sole good of that nation. In thefuture, the contributory factor in life must be emphasised and developed, andthe good of the entire family of nations must be substituted for the good of onenation or a group of nations. The education of the public in this idealnecessitates no loss of national identity or individual culture. That mustremain and be developed to its highest spiritual goal for the enriching and thecollective good of all. It is only the motive for the emphasis of any specificracial and national culture which must be changed.The family of nations, viewed as a unit, its correct and proper interrelation,and the shouldering of responsibility for the one , or for the weak, must be therealised goal of all national enterprise; the resources of the entire planetmust be shared collectively and it must be increasingly realised that theproducts of the earth, the gifts of the soil, the intellectual heritage of thenations, belong to the whole of mankind and to no one nation exclusively. Nonation liveth unto itself, any more than any individual can happily so live; thenation or individual who attempts so to do must [374] inevitably perish off theface of the earth. All nations have made this selfish attempt, as history,ancient and modern, goes to prove. Their tradition, their resources, theirnational genius, their past history, their mineral and agricultural products,their strategic position on the planet, have been used in past centuries for thebenefit of the nation claiming them; they have been exploited for the increaseof the power of that nation at the expense of the suffering of others. This isthe sin which Germany is today committing, aided by Japan and feebly followed byItaly. Power politics, the exploitation of the weak, aggression, economicselfishness, ideals based on pure commercialism and materialistic andterritorial goals colour all the past history of mankind in both hemispheres,and have laid the foundation for the present war.Some nations, particularly the great democracies, like the British Commonwealthof Nations and the United States of America, now realise that these attitudesand activities must end and that the hope of the world lies in the spread ofright human relations, in economic interchange, broad unselfish internationalpolitics and the growth of the spirit of cooperation. They believe unalterably,and as a basic national policy, in the rights of the individual and that theState exists for the benefit of that individual; to that they add the beliefthat the State also exists for the benefit of all other states and for humanityas a whole. Other nations, such as the Axis Powers, are violently crystallisingthe ancient viewpoints, emphasising the worst aspects of the old and evil order,and are aggressively grasping all that they can for themselves. They regard theindividual as of no value and hold that he exists only for the benefit of theState; they believe that the State is the sole unit of importance, and that onlytheir particular state counts. They divide the family of nations into asuperstate for the control of Europe and another for Asia, and regard all otherstates as slave states; they would perpetuate the ancient evil of force and warand would and do resort to unheard-of cruelties in the effort to raise theirstate to supreme eminence.[375] This is the old order which must pass, but its dangers must be recognised.For its abolishing, the United Nations are fighting, but the difficulties aremany, even though the spiritual strength of all good men is on their side andthe Forces of Light are fighting to aid them. The nationalistic spirit is notdead as yet in any country. It must be helped to die. Minorities with historicalbackgrounds but no territorial rights are clamouring for a place to call theirown and in which to build up a nation. The small nations are full of fear,wondering what place in the family of nations they will be permitted to hold,and whether the evil plans of the Germans will spare any of their citizenseventually to form a nation. The demand for national recognition is widespread;the emphasis upon humanity as the important unit is little heard.Those nations impede the path of progress who live in the memory of their pasthistory and boundaries and who look back upon what they call “a glorious past,”resting upon the recollection of national or empire rule over the weak. This isa hard saying, but the nationalistic spirit constitutes a grave peril to theworld; if perpetuated in any form, except as contributory to the good ofhumanity as a whole, it will throw the world (after the war) back into the darkages and leave men no better off than they were, even though there have beentwenty years of travail and agony.We could take the nations, one by one, and observe how this nationalistic,separative or isolationist spirit, emerging out of an historical past, out ofracial complexes, out of territorial position, out of revolt and out ofpossession of material resources, has brought about the present world crisis andcleavage and this global clash of interests and ideals. But it would profit not.The intelligent student of history (who has no nationalistic bias) knows wellthe facts and is deeply concerned today with the processes which must be broughtto bear to end the world strife. He knows that the efforts to attain nationalaggrandisement, a place in the sun, Lebensraum , financial supremacy, economiccontrol [376] and power must end. At the same time he realises that if humanityis to get rid of these evil products of selfishness, certain basic values mustbe preserved. Past and present cultures and civilisations are of great value;the peculiar genius of each nation must be evoked for the enriching of theentire human family; the new civilisation must have its roots in and emerge outof the past; new ideals must come forth and be recognised, and for that theevents and education of the past will have prepared the people. Humanity itselfmust be the goal of interest and effort, and not any particular nation orempire. All this has to be wrought out in a practical, realistic manner,divorced from visionary, mystical and impractical dreams, and all that is donemust be founded on one basic recognition—human brotherhood, expressing itself inright human relations.The revolt so widely prevalent against the “vague visionings” of humanitariandreamers is based upon the fact that out of the welter of words and the plethoraof plans, little of practical value has emerged and nothing sufficiently potentto end the old and horrid ways of life. Nothing really effective had been done,prior to the war, to offset the visible and shrieking evils. Palliative measureshave been tried and compromises made for the sake of peace, but the basic evilsof national ambition, economic disparity, and virulent class distinctions(hereditary or financial) still remained. Religious differences were rampant,racial hatreds widespread, and the economic and political orders remainedcorrupt, fostering party, social and national strife.Today the war has cleared the air. The issues are clear and at least we knowwhat has been wrong. In their demonstration of supreme selfishness, nationalambition, racial hatred and utter barbarity and cruelty, plus their completelack of all humanitarian feeling, the Axis Powers have served the race byshowing us what must not, and shall not, be permitted. The democracies haveawakened also to their weaknesses and to the realisation that true democracydoes not as yet exist, owing to widespread political corruption, and to theignorance and unpreparedness of the masses for [377] true self-government.Imperialistic powers, such as Great Britain, are publicly repudiating the oldpoints of view and are forging ahead in the task of world reconstruction. Theconservative reactionary is no longer popular. The small nations are realisingtheir helplessness and their complete dependence upon their larger neighbours,and these in their turn, are recognising their responsibilities to the weak andsmall. People everywhere are waking up and beginning to think, and never againcan they sink back into the negative condition of the past. There is faith onevery hand that a new and better world order is possible and that it is evenprobable.How can we simply and clearly express the goal of this hoped-for new world orderand word briefly the objective which each person and nation should hold beforeitself when the war ends and opportunity faces each and all? It is surely thatevery nation, great and small (with the minorities given equal and proportionaterights) should pursue its own individual culture and work out its own salvationas seems best to it, but that each and all should develop the realisation thatthey are organic parts of one corporate whole and that they must contribute tothat whole all they have and are. This concept is already present in the heartsof countless thousands and carries with it great responsibility. Theserealisations, when intelligently developed and wisely handled, will lead toright human relations, economic stability (based on the spirit of sharing) andto a fresh orientation of man to man, of nation to nation, and of all to thatsupreme power to which we give the name “God.”This is the vision and it is holding countless thousands steady in the path ofduty, and for it many in every nation are prepared to work. In spite of thebackground of an evil past, in spite of the present world carnage, in spite ofthe almost overwhelming psychological problems confronting humanity, in spite ofpolitical machinations and old-time diplomacy, in spite of the improbability ofany quick successes, there are thousands ready to start with the preparatorywork. The number of men and women of vision [378] and of goodwill is now solarge (especially among the United Nations) that there is a chance of eventualsuccess and it is possible today to make a start. The outline of the futureworld structure can already be dimly seen; the failure—complete, obvious andirremediable—of the old order and the old world is everywhere recognised. Thewill-to-good is growing. One of the interesting things which it is helpful torecognise is that this vision is more clearly seen by the man in the street andby the intelligentsia than it is by the exclusive classes. Through the materialdifficulties of life, and by resultant processes of thought, men know changedconditions are necessary and that there is no alternative.The task ahead falls into two categories: First, directing mass thought andenergy into right lines so that good motive and wise action can bring in thedesired era of right human relations and eventual peace; secondly, educatingthose whose apathy and lack of vision impede progress. This latter phase of thework is well under way and a powerful, though small, group among the worldleaders is voicing certain general propositions which must be regarded asimperative when world readjustment starts. Their demand is for a new governingprinciple in politics and in education, founded on universally recognised humanrights, on the need for spiritual unity and the need to throw overboard allseparative theological attitudes and dogmas in every field of thought. There isa mounting appeal not only for international understanding and cooperation, butalso for class understanding. These demands are being expressed from everyplatform and pulpit and through the pen in every land, except in those sad landswhere freedom of speech is not permitted.The average man looks on at all of this and is frequently overwhelmed by themagnitude of the unfolding task, by the diversity of opinions expressed, by themany suggestions, plans and schemes for world betterment, and by a sense of hisown utter unimportance and futility in the face of this gigantic humanundertaking. He asks himself many questions. Of what use am I? What can I do?How can my little voice be heard, and of what use is it when heard? What [379]part can I play in the vast arena of world affairs? How can I prove myselfuseful and constructive? How can I offset my ignorance of history, of society,of political and economic conditions in my own country, not to speak of otherlands? Humanity is so immense, its numbers so vast and its races so many that hefeels himself a helpless, insignificant unit. He has no academic or generaltraining which would enable him really to grasp the problems or contribute totheir solution. What, therefore, can the man in the street, the business man inhis office, the woman in her home, and the average citizen everywhere contributeat this time and in the future to the helping of the world? It is for this typeof person I write.I would start by reminding the general public of one important fact. This isthat focussed, determined, enlightened public opinion is the most potent forcein the world. It has no equal but has been little used. The gullibility of theaverage citizen, his willingness to accept what is told him if it is said loudlyenough and with sufficient plausible force, is well known. The well-turnedphrases of the trained politician, intent on his selfish purposes, the argumentsof the silver-tongued demagogue as he exploits some pet theory at the expense ofthe public, and the rantings of the man with a cause, a theory or an axe togrind, all find an easy audience. Mass psychology and mob determinations havebeen exploited down the ages, for the unthinking and the emotional are easilyswayed in any direction, and hitherto this has been turned to their ownadvantage by those who do not have the best interests of humanity at heart. Ithas been used for selfish and evil ends far more often than for good. Of thistendency the negative and helpless attitude of the German people under the Nazirulers is the outstanding example.But this negative receptivity (which does not deserve the name of publicopinion) can be as easily turned to good ends as bad, and to constructivemeasures as to destructive. A little planned direction and a wisely outlinedprogramme with this in view can and will bring about [380] the needed change andmake a sound and intelligent public opinion one of the major factors in worldreconstruction. One of the most interesting features of this war period has beenthe direct contact which has been set up by some of the world leaders with theman in the street and the woman in the home, as witness the talks given byRoosevelt and Churchill. Those given by the Axis leaders are in a totallydifferent category, for they have been directed to the male youth of theircountries and to the man in uniform. Only the lesser leaders in Germany, forinstance, talk to the people in their homes, and then only to give them orders,to foster hate and to misrepresent the truth. In all these cases, however, thevalue of mass opinion is recognised and the need to sway the mass mind, eitherbending it to the will of some leader, such as Hitler, or educating it in thoseprinciples which are of benefit to the whole.The second point which needs to be grasped by the average citizen is that themass is made up of individuals; that each of us, as an individual, is a definiteand integral part of the whole. This is a basic and important fact and has abearing on our subject. The first step in the rebuilding process which liesahead of us is to reach the individual, show him his importance, indicate to himhis very real sphere of influence, and then set him to work in that sphere andwith what he has. In this way, his normal and natural sense of futility willdisappear, and he will gradually realise that he is needed and can do much.Having grasped this for himself, he can then try to bring the same constructiveattitude to those around him, and they will then do likewise.May I point out here that the value of the individual is surely based on theinherent divinity of the human spirit and on the integrity of the whole. It isfounded also on the knowledge, which must underlie all future reconstructionwork, that at the very heart of the universe is a divine Power, call it what youwill, and on the faith that love is the very law of life itself, in spite of allappearances and the record of the past.It is essential that we be practical in our approach to [381] the subject andthat the reconstruction plans involve steps which are possible and which theaverage man can take. The first practical attitude to be taken is to crush outhate because it is non-constructive and hindering. It blinds the vision andwarps the judgment, and simply feeds the growth of fear and horror. But the lovedemanded of us is neither emotional nor sentimental. It is intensely practical,and expresses itself in service and cooperative activity. It seeks to aid allmovements that benefit humanity and are in line with the new incoming era. Manypeople think that an emotional reaction and clamouring outcry of horror at whathas overtaken the world indicates love and spiritual sensitivity. It is far morelikely to indicate self-centredness and personal discomfort. True love has notime for these reactions, because the work of alleviation is entirelyengrossing. The man who loves his fellowmen is mentally poised and intelligentlyworking; he is mobilising all his forces for the service of the hour. A trulycompassionate heart is not emotional.Our second step, therefore, after the recognition of individual responsibility,is to replace emotion by practical love, expressed in selfless service. Thethird step is to reorganise our lives so that we have time for this neededservice. Most people are not getting the maximum of results out of their dailylives, and this for several reasons. Frequently they do not really desire tomake the sacrifices which such service demands; often they are under thedelusion that their present output of service represents their utmostpossibility; again, they fancy that their health could stand no more activework, or that they require time for themselves, or they waste many valuablehours doing those things which yield no real results. If, however, the needtoday is as great as we are led to believe, if this is the hour of man’sextremity, if the issues are so great that the entire future of the race dependsupon the outcome of the war, then the one thing that really matters is for manto play his part, to mobilise his time and all that he has and make that supremeeffort which will release life and energy and make the winning of the warsomething immediately possible and the rebuilding [382] era a success. This hemust do at any cost, even that of life itself. A spiritual paradox becomesapparent. The individual is of supreme importance, and yet at the same time whathappens to him as he serves and fights for human freedom is of no individualimportance at all. A brief period of organised effort and, at the end, death, isof more vital usefulness today than a futile doing of the things a man feelslike doing in a leisurely way, and then meandering feebly down the years.Therefore, the development of a sense of individual responsibility, theexpression of real love in service and the reorganising the life so as to getthe utmost out of each day constitutes the preparatory stage for the man whoseeks to participate in the reconstruction period.Having then done this to the best of his ability (and many have already made agood beginning) he must develop in himself and evoke in others the spirit ofgoodwill. This will-to-good is of immediate effectiveness, because it governs aman’s relation to his family and his household, his business or socialassociates, his casual acquaintances and all with whom he may come in contact.It enables him to begin the work of reconstruction right where he is and trainshim in a familiar environment to practise right human relations. It is the majorand potent factor which can enable the otherwise futile individual to become afocal point of constructive influence. He will then discover that, as a resultof this, his sphere of constructive influence is continually enlarging.These are the first four steps, and they are perhaps the most difficult, forthey are non-spectacular and almost constitute spiritual platitudes. But theyare the essential and unavoidable preliminaries for the man who wants to workwisely, usefully and intuitively in the future.To the above he can then add the following efforts and attempt to impose uponhimself this suggested programme:1. Study and reflect upon the many proposals which are being made by worldleaders and thinkers as to the coming world rehabilitation. It will be necessaryto plan your reading [383] and to know what is being discussed. Cultivate anintelligent opinion, based on goodwill and on what you, as a result of study,feel should be done. Then discuss the ideas in your home, among your friends andin your environment without fear or favour. It will help you to do so if youregard such discussions as a service and believe that your interests andenthusiasm cannot fail to have an effect.2. If possible, gather people together to discuss and study the coming worldorder, or cooperate with those who are already doing so. Look upon this meetingtogether as a definite contribution to the moulding of public opinion and as amethod of building up that reservoir of thought power which can be of use tothose whose task it is to rebuild. If only two people cooperate with you in thismatter, the effort will not be lost or futile, for you will be helping to changethe content of world thought and impressing other minds, even if you do not knowit.3. Extend your interest to many countries and try to understand the diverseproblems of those countries. Many know people in these foreign lands, and listscan be made of their names and addresses. As soon as the war is over and thelines of communication are again open, you can seek to reach these people,attempt to locate them through any available agencies, and then, when found,strengthen them with the knowledge of your goodwill or interest and bycooperating with them during the period of reconstruction. No matter how slighthas been your contact with them in the past, foster it by thought and prayer,and later by direct communication. Thus a great network of relationship will beset up which will serve to weld a new world into one harmonious andunderstanding whole.4. Pray constantly, and to your prayers add meditation and reflection. Behindthe world pattern and structure stands its Originator, its Planner, itsmotivating Energy, its central Will, its living Creator, its God. Seek by prayerto reach that central Will and point of Life, thus blending yourself [384] withthe sensed divine objective and identifying your will with the Divine Will. Thiscentral Will-to-Good can be reached by the man whose own will-to-good is aliving, practical experience, and the more that goodwill is expressed, the moreeasily will you discover and cooperate with the divine Plan and follow theguiding hand of God in world affairs. The real work of reconstruction will bedone by those who, in the silence of their own hearts, have walked with God andlearnt His ways.5. Find two other people to work with you. There is a unique potency in thistriple relationship. God Himself, so say all the world Scriptures, works as aTrinity of goodness, and you can, in your tiny sphere, do the same, finding twoother people of like mind with you to form a goodwill triangle of light andspiritual interplay. Each of the two who cooperate with you can, in their turn,do the same, and thus a great network of goodwill can spread throughout theworld. Through it the Forces of Light will be able to work and you, in yourplace and sphere, will have aided and helped.6. Find out and study the methods, techniques and objectives of the variousgroups and organisations which are interested in world reconstruction. You maynot agree with all of them or with their plans and modes of working, but all areneeded. The types of men are many, the races and conditions are varied, and theproblems to be solved will call for innumerable ways of working. All can playtheir part if based on real goodwill and if fanaticism is absent. The fanatic isa danger wherever he is found, for he sees only one side of a question and isunable to appreciate the various points of view. He will not admit that all areneeded. Cooperation is the key to expressed goodwill, and in the future periodof rehabilitation cooperation will be the outstanding need. Keep a record of allsuch groups, their leaders, objectives and programmes. It will prove useful whenthe war is over. Establish helpful and friendly relations with them to the bestof your ability. [385]7. Find and keep a record also of the men and women of goodwill in yourenvironment. Be spiritually aggressive in this matter and go out to discoverthem. When you have found them, then be interested in what they are doing, andalso endeavour to have them cooperate with you in your lines of activity. Keep aregister of the names and addresses of these people, adding also theircapacities and functions if any, and thus build up a mailing list. You will thenbe aware of a group which can be depended upon to work in a spirit of goodwilland for world reconstruction. Later, these lists can be amalgamated, if deemeddesirable, and form a vast mailing list of people in every country who will workalong these indicated lines and who could be reached simultaneously. They willform a body of synchronised public opinion, sufficiently strong to mould ideas,influence the masses, and aid the world leaders to right and appropriate action.8. Above everything else and growing out of all the above suggestions, plandefinitely for the rehabilitation—physical, psychological and spiritual—of thechildren of every country. They have been the victims of wickedness. Let them bethe recipients of loving goodwill instead. The problems of economicrehabilitation, of territorial boundaries, of the demobilisation of armies andthe subsequent re-employment of the demobilised, and of world rebuilding areprofoundly important and will call for expert aid. But the problem of thechildren, as earlier pointed out, underlies the whole necessity for worldrebuilding, is greater than all other problems, is above all racial and nationalbarriers, and evokes the best in every human heart. The children have priorclaim upon all men.I would therefore appeal to all whom I can reach through this article toconcentrate their major effort—mental, spiritual and practical—on preparingthemselves to aid the children of Europe and the other countries which havesuffered so much at the hands of the Axis Powers. This will take much time andcareful planning; it will necessitate [386] enlisting the cooperation of trainedexperts in the field of child welfare, doctors, surgeons, nurses, psychologistsand educators; it will require much money to make the preparation effective, tosend a trained personnel into the destitute and ruined countries and to carryforward the work whilst there; it will take also loving, compassionate actionand long patience. It nevertheless constitutes the most important opportunityconfronting the men and women of goodwill; it is the foundational activity ofthe new world order, for that order must be brought into being for the sake ofthe children of today. They will inhabit this new world, express the new ideals,and hand on to their children that for which we have fought and died, the bestthat we have inherited, and all that we have succeeded in salvaging for them.The thought of the children in the subjugated lands did not arrest the onwardmarch of Hitler’s soldiers; the sanctity of the home and the physical and moralneeds of small children aroused no flicker of compassion in the young mentrained under the Nazi system of education; the relationship of mother and childdid not enter into the calculation of the German agents as they separatedchildren from parents and set the child adrift in a world of carnage or in aninstitutionalised establishment. The planned cruelty must be remedied, and itmust be remedied by the men and women of goodwill and loving hearts.9. Begin now to lay aside, no matter what the personality may demand, such smallsums as can be spared and which can accumulate in preparation for the work ofreconstruction. If we can all do this, it will enable us to take our share inthe work without placing an undue load on others. Will you see to it that thissacrifice and its resulting fund be preserved inviolate in your own hands untilsuch time in the future as you may choose to use it?These are the practical suggestions which it would seem possible to make at thisparticular time. They are of a general nature and basically individual. Thewhole scheme of rebuilding is as yet in the formative thought stage. The [387]process to be followed today is one of self-education and the awakening of allwhom we can reach. It will demand the intelligent study and consideration ofmethods with which to meet this need, and the discovery of those who,irrespective of nationality or religion, can be depended upon to cooperate inthe various phases of the work of reconstruction. In this work of preparation,all can share.To this task we are all called, and to it there are many voices calling today;there are thousands who have dreamed the same dream, seen the same vision,believed in the divine possibilities which are latent in all human hearts andwho know, past all controversy, that selfishness and universal greed havebrought the world to its present desperate plight. They know also that selflesssharing and cooperative understanding between all men of goodwill everywhere canrebuild a new world, bring into being a more beautiful life, and restore thatwhich humanity itself has destroyed. The best is yet to be. We can rest backupon the realisation that the history of the human race has been one of a steadymoving forward down the ages and towards the light.~AN IMMINENT SPIRITUAL EVENTMarch 1943We are nearing the climax of the spiritual year. The greatest Approach of alltime is imminent and possible. Much depends now upon the aspirants and disciplesof the world, particularly those in physical incarnation today. A major contactbetween Shamballa and the Hierarchy, for which initiates and Masters have, forcenturies, been preparing is in process of consummation. I shall very shortly begiving you some further information on the subject in an attempt to anchor onthe earth that seed of the new world religion which an earlier instruction uponthe Great Approaches (“A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. II (EotericPsychology), Pages 701-751.) indicated might be founded, and lead to a truestart of a universal faith which will serve the need of [388] humanity for along time to come. All I ask of you today is to begin now a most carefulpreparation for the event which is impending at the time of the Full Moon ofMay, so that the energies then set in motion may be aided by your directedthought and you yourselves may come more fully into the current of thedownpouring life.At the coming Wesak Festival and until the Full Moon of June including the fivedays after that Full Moon I ask you to use both of the Invocations (pp. 144,249), thus testifying greatly to the fusion of humanity into one great group ofinvocative appeal. Make a real effort to be present and in group formation atthe exact time of the Full Moon of May, as far as you know it, using bothInvocations and believing that you are voicing the unified will and desire ofhumanity itself. I will enlarge upon this in my Wesak message, but I seek to getthis to you as early as possible so that my own group, in process of training,can lay the needed foundations of the work to be done.Let me extend this concept a little further by pointing out that the invocativecry of humanity and of the Hierarchy, jointly sounded at the time of the FullMoons of May and June and particularly at the Wesak Festival, will be effectiveif the “cold light” of the aspirants and disciples of the world and of allselfless servers, no matter who or where they may be found, is united with the“clear light” of the initiates and of those who can function freely as souls—theMembers of the Hierarchy and, to a lesser degree, all accepted disciples. Thiscombination is the one that is desired and required. These people are relativelyfew in number, when compared with the world’s population, but because they areto be found focussed at “the deep centre” and are distinguished by the qualityof fusion and at-one-ment, they can be enormously potent. I would, therefore,ask all of you (during the weeks prior to the Full Moon of May and that of Juneand for five days thereafter) to seek to “dwell ever at the centre,” toendeavour to blend the cold light of your personalities with the clear light ofyour soul, so as to work effectively for the five weeks of the desired period.[389]~A SPECIAL WESAK MESSAGEApril 1943This communication is addressed to the members of the New Group of World Serverswho can be reached (there are countless numbers of whom you have no knowledge)and to the men and women of goodwill everywhere. I would ask you to see that asmany receive this as possible. We are nearing the climax of the spiritual yearand the time that the Sun moves northward. The greatest Approach of all time isclose and possible. Much however depends upon the aspirants and the disciples inthe world at this time. The past year has been one of the world’s worstexperiences from the standpoint of agony and distress; the point of acutestsuffering has been reached. It has, however, been the year in which the greatestspiritual Approach of all time has shown itself to be possible—an Approach forwhich the initiates and Masters have for centuries been preparing, and for whichall the Wesak Festivals since the meeting of the Great Council in 1925 have beenpreparatory. I have, in past instructions, referred to the great meetings heldat intervals by Those to Whom is entrusted the spiritual guidance of the planetand particularly of man. Certain facts must be assumed, such as the acceptancein the Western hemisphere of the existence of the Christ and in the Eastern, ofthe Buddha. It is, therefore, surely possible (given this acceptance) to assumethat They and Their disciples must and do confer together upon the steps neededto guide mankind along the path of light, the path to God. To this all the worldScriptures bear witness and to this all spiritual knowers testify. I have nottime today to enlarge upon this theme. I simply ask for your acceptance of thehypothesis (an hypothesis which is a fact to many millions and a proved event tomany thousands) that spiritual guidance is accorded to mankind and that behindthe veil which separates the visible from the invisible there stand Those Whoare working strenuously—and, I might add, scientifically—to meet the presentdire need.[390] Two things are occupying Their attention:1. The need to bring the present strife and warfare to an end and so releasemankind from an evil past and open the door to a better future.2. The opportunity to lay the foundations for that new world religion which willsuffice to meet man’s need for many centuries ahead and for which all past worldreligions have prepared him.Such, brother of mine, are two of the objectives lying before the Hierarchy atthis time as it prepares for the Full Moons of May and June. Can the forces beso organised and the energies, pending distribution, so dispersed that the fullmeasure of good can be evoked? Can the evocation of a new cycle of spiritualcontact and of liberation be brought about by the action of the men and women ofgoodwill? Can the will-to-good of the spiritual Energies and the goodwill ofhumanity itself be brought together and produce those conditions in which thenew world order—visioned by all who truly love their fellowmen—be enabled tofunction? Can the situation be so staged that the new world religion and the newapproach of humanity to God are brought into being? These are the importantquestions which the Hierarchy is today attempting to answer.The group of spiritual workers of whom I happen to be one is faced with twomajor problems: the problem of the war itself with its stupefying and stunningeffect upon the masses everywhere, and the problem offered by the aspirants anddisciples throughout the world. Can the suffering masses of men “stand withmassed intent” and with eyes directed towards God so that their cry can mount toHis ears? And will the spiritually minded people and the workers for humanitymake that supreme effort (rendered from an adequate “point of tension”) so thathumanity may be focussed in its appeal and bring about a response from thehighest available sources. Can the united effort of these two groups—oneconscious of what is happening and the other unconscious—evoke reply?[391] In moments of extreme urgency or crisis, the story of the Christ brings toour attention the fact that He then came in touch with His Father in Heaven. Godspoke to Him in terms of recognition; God testified to the fact that He knew Himfor His beloved Son. To these basic facts of the historical record, we must addthe realisation that “as He is, so are we in this world” and the assurance ofChrist Himself that God is also our Father. Then the door of possibility opens.We can come then to the realisation that in times of intense human urgency,stress and crisis and when the soul of man is adequately aroused to the neededpoint of spiritual receptivity (as was ever the case with Christ) then there canlikewise come a divine recognition from the highest possible source which willsuffice to bring release and liberation and to give power—power to do the right,to take those steps which are demanded by the spiritual purpose and to proceed,consequently, along the path of evolution.Let me here point out that where this is a group activity upon the physicalplane there is—under the Law of Balance and of Action and Reaction—a parallelingspiritual activity. The entire world of men is today engaged in an intenseactivity in the material world—marching armies, factories working in shiftstwenty-four hours a day, seething migrations and deportations of people, intenseair activity and the organising and planned work of the hundreds of reliefagencies in every country—to mention only a few of the myriad activities. Thepersonalities of men everywhere are engaged and mentally, emotionally andphysically they are all working at high pressure. The impact of circumstance andevents has never been so potent. Alongside of this material activity of humanityis to be found the strenuous endeavour, the effort to think constructively, thefocussed idealism, the registration of vision and the spiritual aspiration ofthe people of goodwill, of the disciples everywhere, plus the trained spiritualactivity of the Hierarchy and of the spiritual leaders of the race upon theouter and the inner side of life. To this must be added the activity (thewaiting [392] activity, if I might use so paradoxical a phrase) of that centreof life where the will of God is focussed.There are therefore, (speaking in terms of spiritual endeavour) the followinggroups whose massed intent is to bring about the liberation of humanity and whoare to be found everywhere in the world:1. The men and women of goodwill.2. The idealists and the dreamers of dreams, the visioners of a future world.3. The spiritually minded people whom we call the world aspirants.4. Disciples throughout the planet.5. The Members of the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, either in or out ofincarnation. 6. The Custodians of the Will or Purpose of God, holding Themselves inreadiness at Shamballa and listening for the demand for succour asit rises from mankind. 7. Certain great Energies of extra-planetary significance Who stand ready tointervene should the spiritual invocation or the distress of humanity reachthe pitch of evocation.The problem is how to fuse and blend the first five groups so that the spiritualappeal can express a group integrated and united demand. Only such a uniteddemand, focussing the “massed intent” of mankind will suffice to evoke anextra-planetary response.Much of this task of unification lies in the hands of two groups: the planetaryHierarchy and the New Group of World Servers. With the work of the first group,mankind has little to do, for They can be depended upon to fulfil Their task andto shoulder Their responsibility to the full. With the work of the New Group ofWorld Servers all of you have much to do and it is about this work that I writeat this time.I shall not waste time in defining the personnel of this group. Suffice it tosay that all who truly love their fellowmen [393] and who serve them withsacrifice and selfless understanding constitute this group. Along with theaffiliated body of men of goodwill, the members of the New Group of WorldServers must now prepare themselves for a great act of service at the time ofthe May and June Full Moons and throughout the weeks preceding those times.The statements which I am now going to make, I will put as briefly as possible,leaving you to ponder upon them and trusting you to understand them. What I havenow to say will fall into three parts:1. The work of the Hierarchy in the immediate future at these Full Moon Periods2. The task of the New Group of World Servers today3. The New World Religion and its spiritual future.It is necessary for you to understand the immediate spiritual possibilitieswhich confront humanity if those of you who have vision and love humanity are tomeasure up to the immediate opportunity. It is necessary that you should graspthe immediate preparatory steps which you can take in relation to thosepossibilities and should also have a vision of the principles which must governthe new world religion, with its outstanding points of focus. I do not intend toplead with you, as in the past, or ask you for cooperation either to serve orsacrifice. I only seek to give you information, leaving you to make dueapplication under the urge of your own souls.The Work of the Hierarchy in the Immediate FutureThe past history of the relations existing between the Hierarchy as a whole andhumanity as a whole can be summarised in the idea of the carrying out of certainGreat Approaches between Those who express the spiritual attitude and those whoare frankly material in their attitude. By means of these Approaches, humanityhas been brought (in consciousness) increasingly nearer to the spiritual centresof love and life and has been stimulated to make spiritual [394] progress, toawaken to the light within, to unfold the Christ consciousness and to find thePath of Light which leads to divinity. This steady trend towards increasingrelationship has focussed itself throughout the historical record by means ofcertain great registered revelations—the result of these Approaches. Always inmoments of crisis and tension, the cry of humanity has evoked response from theHierarchy which has come, sometimes rapidly, sometimes more slowly, but alwaysinevitably. In modern history, two such Approaches are recognised as existing ona broad human scale, i.e., the one which focussed through the coming of theBuddha to the Eastern civilisation and that which focussed through the Christ,coming to the West. Another Great Approach is now at hand but its date isdependent upon the activity of the New Group of World Servers and the spiritualtension which they can achieve.A major preparatory period to this Approach took place in 1936 and in thispreparation many of you participated; it culminated at the time of the Full Moonof May that year in a worldwide use of the first Invocation which I gave you.Now, seven years later, comes the opportunity to carry forward the work thenstarted and to achieve results which may release spiritual tides of forces andthese may turn the tide of battle. I refer not here to the battle in thephysical sense. The war, from the physical angle, is already won though manymonths may elapse before the victory in the East and in the West is completelyachieved. This you realise. But—again paralleling this physical achievement—mustcome a spiritual victory and this could be described as the gaining of a newspiritual orientation and a new attitude towards God, to express it very simply.In reverse, I might point out that the reasons for a measure of failure in 1936can be traced to two sources. The work was relatively so successful that itcalled forth a powerful paralleling activity upon the part of the Forces ofEvil; these were potent enough to overwhelm temporarily the Forces of Light andto bring on the war with all its attendant horrors. Secondly, the New Group ofWorld [395] Servers, the men and women of goodwill and the aspirants everywhererelaxed their efforts; they did not hold the tension gained but slipped backinto negligence; the work did not go on and this in spite of the constant effortof a few. But they were too few.Now again comes opportunity and the possibility of a Great Approach which can bethe consummation of the work started in 1936. The battle is on between theForces of Light and the Forces of Evil . To end this warfare rapidly, and withsuccess, leaving a wide open door to a better world, the Forces of Life must becalled in. It is this which is engaging the attention of the Hierarchy at thistime. For aiding in this endeavour the Buddha is preparing Himself and for thisthe Christ stands ready, focussing in Himself the desire of Humanity for that“life more abundantly” which He promised when here before, and for liberationfrom evil and admission into good. One of the realisations emerging out of thiswar is the fact that humanity has now, as a whole, been able to see and graspmore clearly than ever before, the nature of evil. Men are recoiling in horrorfrom this display of rampant evil and even the wicked man is shocked andarrested by the unleashed wickedness which is today stalking the Earth. Thatrealisation is good and will help the needed reorientation of mankind towardsGod and good.Putting it very simply, the Hierarchy is today getting ready for a GreatApproach which will have two results:1. It will bring about a closer relation between those great Lives Who embodythe will of God and are the Custodians of the divine purpose, and Those Whoembody the love of God and are the Custodians of the immediate Plan forhumanity. This relationship can be established at the time of the May Full Moonat which time the Buddha will embody in Himself the powerful downpouring ofenergy—the dynamic energy of the divine will. The Christ, at the same time, willembody the outpouring dominant demand of the spiritual aspiration of mankind,plus [396] the demand of the Hierarchy for the needed aid at this time ofcrisis.2. It will also bring about a closer relation between mankind and the Hierarchy.At the time of the June Full Moon, the Christ will focus in Himself thespiritual energies of the Hierarchy, plus the energy which the Buddhadistributed at the time of the Wesak Festival; the New Group of World Serverswill focus the spiritual demand for life and liberation, voicing the “massedintent” of humanity.If both aspects of this one work can be satisfactorily carried forward, then agreat release can be brought about. The Lords of Liberation could besuccessfully invoked; the Spirit of Peace might appear as the “Rider from theSecret Place” and the new era of goodwill (based upon the will-to-good) might beinaugurated. I say “might be” because, my brothers, the success of all thatcould happen is dependent upon the work done by you and all men of goodwill, bythe religious and spiritually minded people everywhere and by the worldaspirants between the sacred season of May and June, 1943, and that of 1944.Esoterically speaking, the work of the Hierarchy is to focus the divinewill-to-good as it affects humanity. The work of spiritually minded men is toevoke that will-to-good on earth through as full an expression as possible ofgoodwill. It is the goodwill of the masses, focussed everywhere through theUnited Nations who are fighting for the liberation of mankind and through theNew Group of World Servers, which is sufficient to invoke the will-to-good andonly this is adequate. This is an important statement and one on which I wouldask you to ponder.During the past six years I have given you two Stanzas of a Great Invocation.The first one ran as follows:Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind.Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.So let it be and help us to do our part.[397] This expressed the normal, largely unconscious, invocative cry ofhumanity. It summed up in itself the desire of all men everywhere for peace, forgoodwill and cooperation. It was generally popular and was and still is verywidely used. It was fairly easily understood and its outstanding note was peace.It was used as a prayer by the majority and not as a challenging demand as hadbeen intended; it did not, therefore, prove adequately effective in arrestingthe onward march of evil. It does, however, preserve the form which can and willevoke eventually the Spirit of Peace. This evocation will bring to humanity thatstimulation and active desire to participate in the expression of goodwill whichwill render world peace an effective outcome of wise action and theestablishment of right human relations. Just as the Great Lord of Love and Sonof God, the Christ, used as His vehicle of expression on earth, the form of theMaster Jesus, so this great extra-planetary Life, the Spirit of Peace, can beenabled, on a higher turn of the spiral, to use as His vehicle of expression,the form of the Christ, the Prince of Peace; thus His stupendous energies willbe stepped down through the medium of the Lord of Love and become available tothe mass of men.I gave you later another Stanza of the Invocation, of great power which wassuited to the conditions of war—a war which proved inevitable and unavoidable.This last Invocation was not so popular and not nearly so easily understood andfor this there was very good reason. It was an invocation intended to evoke theForces of Life just as the previous one invoked the Forces of Light and Love. Itcould only be successfully used by disciples, advanced thinkers and theHierarchy itself. It was, however, given out to the public so as to familiarisethem as far as possible with the concepts of liberation and life and in aneffort to anchor upon Earth [398] a new point of focus through which life couldbe made to flow. This effort has not been totally unsuccessful.At the time of the Full Moon of May and of June, it will be advisable to useboth these Invocations and thus to fuse and blend into one united invocation themassed intent of humanity as a whole and the enlightened purpose of thedisciples and the Hierarchy. This fusion of the two groups—Humanity and theHierarchy—may then suffice to sound out such a potent call that life may bereleased on Earth instead of death and the love of God play its active part inthe reconstruction of world affairs. If this can be successfully accomplished,two great revelations may then be speeded on their way:1. A revelation of light and understanding to humanity as a whole, leading themto knowledge and enabling men to see the cause of the present catastrophe, for“in that light shall we see Light.” In that light, humanity will know what to doand how to rectify past errors.2. A revelation of life and of “life more abundantly” as Christ promised when onearth. This revelation will give to the thinkers, idealists, true leaders anddisciples working in the world today, that spiritual energy which leads to rightactivity, sound leadership and inspired and inspiring living.Such is another of the goals confronting the Hierarchy at this time. Such is thewill of God for humanity and such is the intent and purpose of Shamballa. Whenthe massed purpose of the Custodians of the Will of God and the massed intent ofthe souls of men can be synchronised, then the Great Approach will becomeinevitable and the Great Release will automatically follow.The Task of the New Group of World Servers TodayThe immediate task of the New Group of World Servers is to focus the massedlonging, aspiration, desire and intent [399] of humanity so as to bring aboutthe needed synchronisation at the time of the Full Moon of May and of June thisyear, and throughout the intervening weeks from the receipt of thiscommunication (as far as you are concerned) until July first, approximately.This they must do through their own clear thinking on current matters, by thecultivation of a receptive spirit, based on a willingness to learn, a readinessto let old preconceptions go and fixed ideas to disappear under the impact ofnew truths and new inspiration, and based also on a determination at all coststo recognise truth and presented spiritual developments.I would ask all of you, therefore, to have an open mind, to redouble your beliefin the fact of the spiritual realities, to have faith in the will-to-good of thedivine purpose and to love your fellowmen; and—upon the plane of practicalaffairs and living—to do two things: Carry forward your due share in thisphysical plane war, aiding the armed forces of the United Nations to wage war toa successful finish, knowing that there are spiritual realities for which it isworth dying if need be, and that war on evil can be waged without hate and withright purpose; secondly, plan at the same time for those practical measureswhich, after the war is over, will aid the period of reconstruction and helprehabilitate humanity, and lead to a saner, better, truer way of living.I would ask you also to take those measures in your individual life and in yourenvironment, wherever possible, which will help make the work to be done at thetime of the Full Moon in May and in June successful; to use both the Invocationsconstantly; do not use them as prayers or employing the energy of desire but asgreat challenging demands, employing the power of the will as you can muster itand focus it at a point of tension. At the time of the Full Moon gather peopletogether for an act of fusion and of cooperation, thus aiding humanity andthrowing your small individual effort behind that of the Hierarchy. I would askyou to recognise that, as a part of [400] the New Group of World Servers and asa person of goodwill you can act as a mediating factor between humanity and theHierarchy, bridging the gap between the mass of men (stunned by suffering, blindto the higher issues, and inert) and the spiritual Group which is seeking soearnestly to bring them help and life. I would have you use, with all the powerwhich in you lies, the creative imagination as you endeavour to do this and tobelieve that the sincerity of your purpose and the love of your hearts can andwill help make possible the Great Approach and so hasten the Great Release. Iwould have you (from the time you receive this communication) think deeply onwhat I have said, to walk silently in the light of your souls, to radiate love,to seek clarity of vision and then, when needed, to speak to others with powerand understanding.I would, finally, have you realise that in the work now being done and as aresult of the Great Approach you can aid in the focussing or anchoring of thenew world religion, that universal religion which will be founded on all thepast, which will consummate the work of the Christ and which will open up afresh stretch (if I may use such an expression) upon the Path of Light whichleads to God.The New World ReligionAll past divine revelations have brought humanity to the point where(spiritually speaking) man’s essential divinity is theologically recognised,where the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God are recognised ideals andwhere science has demonstrated the fact of an unfolding purpose and theexistence of a fundamental, intelligent Agent behind all phenomena. Step by stepman has been led through prayer, the voice of desire, through worship, therecognition of deity, through affirmation of the fact of human identity ofnature with the divine, to a belief in the divinity of man. Orthodox religionemphasises the divinity of the Christ, and He Himself has told us (and the NewTestament in many places emphasises it) that we also are divine, all [401] of usare the Sons of God and that as He is so are we in this world and that we areable to do still greater things than Christ did because He has shown us how.Such is the religious background of the spiritual thinking in the world.Therefore, taking our stand on these truths, acknowledging the fact of ourdivinity and recognising the glory of all past revelations and the still moreglorious promise of the future, we can begin to realise that the time has nowcome for the presentation of the new step in this unfolding revelation. We canrealise that to our past programmes of prayer, worship and affirmation, the newreligion of Invocation and Evocation can be added, in which man will begin touse his divine power and come into closer touch with the spiritual sources ofall life.This new form of the one religion will be in fact the Religion of the GreatApproaches—approaches between mankind and the great spiritual Centres whichoperate behind the scenes, between groups of workers on the physical plane andin the three worlds of human evolution and spiritual groups upon the innerplanes, such as the Ashrams of the Masters and the egoic groups with which allhuman beings are in subjective—though usually unknown—relation.The new religion will be one of Invocation and Evocation, of bringing togethergreat spiritual energies and then stepping them down for the benefiting and thestimulation of the masses. The work of the new religion will be the distributionof spiritual energy and the protecting of humanity from energies and forceswhich they are not, at the particular time, fitted to receive. A little carefulthought will show you how, at the coming Full Moon Festivals, these thoughts arepresent: the protection and liberation of humanity and the stimulation ofmankind through the distribution and the transference of spiritual energy sothat the right steps can be taken in any given period, leading mankind out ofdarkness into light, from death to immortality and from the unreal to the Real.I would have you, therefore, add to your mental and spiritual activity therecognition that you are participating [402] in the task of anchoring the basictenets of the new world religion—the flower and fruition of the past and thehope of the future.More along this line, I may not write at this time. Later I will elaborate foryou the greater and the lesser festivals of the spiritual year as they willgradually supersede the festivals of the present world religions in the East andin the West. (See: The Reappearance of the Christ, Chapter VI.) Much that youhave learnt and gradually absorbed will then be seen fitting into the generalspiritual plan. You will find that the spiritual year is divided into twoperiods (symbolic of spirit and matter); the period in which the Sun movesnorthward and the period when it travels on the southern way. You will find thatthe month divides itself into two periods likewise, that of the waxing and thewaning moon and you will find the future emphasis laid throughout the world uponthe Easter Festival, the Festival of the Risen Christ; upon the Wesak Festival,the Festival of the Buddha or of Illumination; and the June Full Moon, theFestival of Unification carried forward by the Christ, the Master of all theMasters and the Teacher alike of angels and of men.Today, however, I seek to focus your attention upon the immediate task ofcooperation with the Hierarchy and strengthen you to play your part in worldsalvage.~THE NEW WORLD RELIGIONMay 1943In the first part of my message under this title (see: The Reappearance of theChrist, Chapter VI) I had much to say about the form into which the great worldreligions in the East and in the West have crystallised and its consequentdeterioration. It will be essential, therefore, to look at and appreciate thefundamental truths which that form has preserved, even whilst hiding them. Itwill be valuable for us to realise that within the churches men of God anddisciples of the Christ have ever worked, laboured and suffered. They have seenand agonised over the distortions [403] and the misrepresentations. They havebeen hindered by the organisation, oft despised by the theologians, and haveremained simple in the midst of learning. They have been loving and universal intheir individual consciousness, among the separative and fanatical. They are theglory of the church—oft hated when alive and oft canonised after death. Theirglory lies in the fact that they testify to the progress of the spiritual manand express in fullness what is in every evolving man; they are the flower ofevolution and the tried representatives of God. In the indictment of thechurches, given earlier, let us not forget the Christians found within thosechurches.I would remind you that I write as one who believes in the great spiritualrealities and who regards the unfolding spirit of man as the unshatterableevidence of the existence of “the One in Whom we live and move and have ourbeing.” I speak as one who believes in and loves the Christ and who knows Him tobe the Master of all the Masters and the Teacher alike of angels and of men. Iam one who looks to the Christ as the supreme expression of divinity upon Earthand who knows the extent of His sacrificial work for humanity, the wonder of therevelation which He brought, the imminence of His return and of His comingAssumption of spiritual rule in the hearts of men everywhere. I know that He hasno pleasure in the great stone temples which man has built whilst His people areleft without practical guidance or reasonable light upon their affairs; and Iknow too that He feels, with an aching heart, that the simplicity which Hetaught, and the simple Way to God which He emphasised have disappeared in thefogs of theology and the discussions of churchmen throughout the centuries. Iknow that He realises that the words He spoke have been lost in the labyrinthsof the ecclesiastical minds which have sought to interpret them, and that thesimple teaching of the Approach to God which He taught has been superseded bythe pomp and ceremony of elaborate rituals.To sum up: Because of the divergences of the many exoteric faiths, themultiplicity of the sects and cults in both [404] the Orient and Occident, andthe quarrels of theologians over words, phrases and interpretations, the sons ofGod—in process of development—are left without the needed help to contact theChrist and His great group of disciples, the spiritual leaders of humanity; theway to Christ, the living, loving Expression of God, is not made clear to theseeker. Together, the two great Sons of God present to mankind—the One in theEast and the Other in the West—a complete and perfect representation of Deity;by Their lives and words They guarantee to man the possibilities always latentin the human spirit.Today the Christ and the Buddha wait until the hour strikes. Then Their unitedeffort, plus the invocative appeal of all who truly know and truly love , willbring humanity the new revelation for which they wait.The new world religion must be based upon those truths which have stood the testof the ages. This I said elsewhere and enumerated four of those truths:1. The Fact of God2. Man’s Relationship to God3. The Fact of Immortality and Eternal Persistence4. The Continuity of Revelation and the Divine Approaches.These four facts are basic realities and truths which have conditioned themasses of men for aeons. Human unhappiness is founded primarily upon man’sinability to live fully in the consciousness of these four fundamentalrealisations. But they are steadily taking shape in human thinking, and for themthe United Nations fights.Two more great and foundational facts are also part of the human state ofawareness.5. The fact of our relationship with each other . This is as much a foundationalspiritual fact as is God Himself, because it is linked with our knowledge of Himas Father.[405] This relationship we call “brotherhood” and it expresses itself (or shouldI say, it will eventually express itself?) through human fellowship and righthuman relations. For this we work, and humanity is moving towards thatrelationship—and that in spite of the fact of war.6. The fact of the Path to God. Awareness of this has been preserved for us downthe ages by those who knew God and whom the world called mystics, occultists andsaints. Opening out before aspiring men stretches the Way. The history of thehuman soul is the history of the search for that Way and its discovery by thepersistent.In every race and nation, in every climate and part of the world, and throughoutthe endless reaches of time itself, back into the limitless past, men have foundthe Path to God; they have trodden it and accepted its conditions, endured itsdisciplines, rested back in confidence upon its realities, received its rewardsand found their goal. Arrived there, they have “entered into the joy of theLord,” participated in the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, dwelt in theglory of the divine Presence, and then returned to the ways of men, to serve.The testimony to the existence of this Path is the priceless treasure of all thegreat religions and its witnesses are those who have transcended all forms andall theologies, and have penetrated into the world of meaning which all symbolsveil.These truths are part of all that the past gives to man. They are our eternalheritage, and connected with them there is no new revelation but onlyparticipation and understanding. These are the facts which the World Teachershave brought to us, suited to our need and capacity at any given time. They arethe inner structure of the One Truth upon which all the world theologies havebeen built, including the Christian doctrines and dogmas built around the Personof Christ and His teaching.Dimly sensed by the evolving human consciousness hovers another emerging truthof a larger nature—larger [406] because related to the Whole and not just toindividual man and his personal salvation. It is an extension of the individualapproach to truth. Let us call it the truth of the Great Cyclic Approaches ofthe divine to the human of which all world Teachers and Saviours were the symboland the guarantee. At certain great moments, down the ages, God drew nearer toHis people and humanity (blindly and unconscious of their objective) at the sametime made great efforts to draw near to God. On the part of God, this wasintentional, conscious and deliberate; on the part of man, it was largelyunconscious, forced upon him by the tragedy of circumstance, by desperate needand by the driving urge of the collective soul. These Great Approaches can betraced down the centuries, and each time one took place it meant a clearerunderstanding of divine purpose, a new and fresh revelation, the institution ofsome form of a new religion and the sounding of a note which produced a newcivilisation and culture, or a fresh recognition of relationship between God andman or man and his brother.A new definition of God was given us when the Buddha taught that God was Lightand showed us the way of illumination, and when Christ revealed to us that Godwas Love through His life and service on earth. Today the knowledge aspect ofillumination is being comprehended, but the inner meaning of love is only nowdimly sensed. Yet light and love have been revealed to the world by two greatSons of God in two Approaches. A new Approach is on the Way, bringing us thenext needed truth. We ask ourselves: What will it be? For it, the knowers andlovers of God and of their fellowmen are prepared; for it, the masses of menwait.Some of these Approaches have been of a major nature, affecting humanity as awhole, and some of them are of less importance affecting only a relatively smallpart of mankind—a nation or a group. Those Who come as the Revealers of the loveof God come from that spiritual centre to which the Christ gave the name “theKingdom of God.” Here dwell the “spirits of just men made perfect”; here [407]the spiritual Guides of the race are to be found and here the spiritualExecutives of God’s plans live and work and oversee human and planetary affairs.It is called by many names by many people. It is spoken of as the SpiritualHierarchy, as the Abode of Light, as the centre where the Masters of the Wisdomare to be found, as the Great White Lodge. From it come those who act asMessengers of the Wisdom of God, Custodians of the truth as it is in Christ, andThose Whose task it is to save the world, to impart the next revelation and todemonstrate divinity. All the world Scriptures bear witness to the existence ofthis centre of spiritual energy. This spiritual Hierarchy has been steadilydrawing nearer to humanity as men have become more conscious of divinity andmore fitted for contact with the divine.Behind this spiritual centre of Love and Light another centre is to be found,for which the West has no name but which is called in the East by the nameShamballa. Perhaps the Western name is Shangri-Lha—a name which is findingrecognition everywhere and which stands for a centre of happiness and purpose.Shamballa or Shangri-Lha is the place where the Will of God is focussed and fromwhich His divine purposes are directed. From it the great political movementsand the destiny of races and nations and their progress are determined, just asthe religious movements, the cultural unfoldments and spiritual ideas are sentforth from the hierarchical centre of Love and Light. Political and socialideologies and world religions, the Will of God and the Love of God, the Purposeof divinity and the plans whereby that purpose is brought into activity allfocus through that centre of which we are each consciously a part, Humanityitself. There are, therefore, three great spiritual centres on the planet:Shamballa, the spiritual Hierarchy, and Humanity.There is definite Biblical testimony to this highest of all centres, Shamballa.At moments of crisis in the earthly life of Christ we read that a Voice spoke toHim, the Voice of the Father was heard by Him, affirming His Sonship and settingthe seal of approval upon His acts and work. At that [408] moment a great fusionof the two spiritual centres—the Hierarchy and Shamballa, the Kingdom of God andthe world of Spirit—was brought about, and thus spiritual energy was released onEarth. We need to remember that the work of all World Saviours and Teachers isto act primarily as distributors of divine energy and as channels for spiritualforce. This outpouring manifests either as the impulse behind a world religion,the incentive behind some new political ideology, or the principle of somescientific discovery of importance to the growth of the human spirit. Thus doreligions, governments and civilisations find their motivation. History hasdemonstrated that again and again these developments are the results of theappearance and the activity of some great man at an advanced stage ofdevelopment. Those who come forth as Teachers, Saviours or Founders of a newreligion come forth from the Hierarchy and are of the highest order of spiritualperfection. Those who convey to man the purposes of God through new ideologicalconcepts are not as yet of so high an order, because man is not yet ready forthe highest presentation. Much has yet to be learnt and mastered by man, andspiritual unfoldment always outpaces the outer expression of human relationshipsand the social order; hence the world religions come first and produce theconditions which make the work of the rulers possible. Those who come forth fromthe spiritual centre, Shamballa, are of great power, however, and the thread ofTheir influence can be traced throughout history in great declarations andpronouncements such as the Magna Charta, the Declaration of Independence and theAtlantic Charter. Those who come forth from Shamballa or the Hierarchy for therelease and the guidance of humanity are evoked by human desire and demand, forthere is a spiritual interplay existing between Humanity and the Hierarchy, andbetween both and Shamballa.Such Messengers embody divine intention. The response of mankind to Theirmessages is dependent upon the point in evolution which has been attained byman. Back in the early history of the race these Approaches were rare indeed.[409] Countless ages passed between them. Today, owing to the greatly increasedpower of the human mind and the growing sensitivity of the human soul to thespiritual values as they express themselves through major world ideologies,these Approaches of the divine to the human can become more frequent and aretaking on a new form. Man’s inner realisation of his own innate spiritualpotency and the unfoldment of his sense of relationship are bringing about aneffort on his part—consciously undertaken—to make true progress towards thegood, the true and the beautiful, and this in spite of the fact of the war andthe misery and suffering present upon our Earth. It has therefore becomepossible to synchronise the Approach of the divine to the human and to instructthe masses of men in the technique of thus invoking the Approach. This attitudeof humanity will lead to a new revelation, to the new world religion and to newattitudes in the relation of man to God (religion) and of man to man (governmentor social relationships).Two major Approaches are to be found in the past history of the race, and bothare of such significance that it would be well to note them here. They lie sofar back in human history that we have only myth and monument to indicate theirhappening.The first great Approach of the divine to man caused the appearance of the humansoul and the adding of another kingdom in nature to the three (mineral,vegetable and animal) already existing. The kingdom of man appeared on Earth.Aeons passed away whilst primitive man continued to evolve, and when the secondgreat Approach took place and the Spiritual Hierarchy of our planet drew nearerto humanity; the spiritual Way to God was opened for those who consciously canmove forward, who can definitely demonstrate the Christ spirit, and whoearnestly seek enlightenment and liberation. The true appeal of Christ’s words:“Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free” urges them to moveforward into the light, through the gate of initiation and on to that path which“shineth [410] ever more and more until the perfect day.” At the time of thesecond great Approach, the fact of the existence of the Spiritual Hierarchy, ofthe open door to initiation and of the Way of Sacrifice first dawned on thehuman consciousness; from that moment men have found the Way and have moved outof the human kingdom into the spiritual; they have transformed their humanconsciousness into divine awareness. The kingdom of man and the kingdom of Godwere brought into relationship. Religion became a factor in the development ofthe human spirit and God drew nearer to His Own. God Transcendent firstconditioned man’s concept of Deity. Then God as the national controller tookpossession of man’s mind, and the Jehovah concept (as depicted in the Jewishdispensation) appeared; next God was seen as the perfected human being, and thedivine God-man walked the Earth in the person of the Christ. Today, we have arapidly growing emphasis on God Immanent in every human being. Such have beenthe results of the second great Approach and such have been the results of thework of the world Saviours and Teachers down the ages, culminating in the workof Christ, Who summed up in Himself the unfoldments of the past and the hope ofthe future.A third great Approach is now possible and will take place once the world war isover and man—purified by fire and suffering—has set his house in order and isready, therefore, for a new revelation. For this coming revelation the work ofthe Buddha and of the Christ has been preparatory. They embodied in Themselvestwo lesser Approaches, and through Their united effort, humanity throughout theworld has been prepared to play its part in this third Approach.The Buddha came embodying in Himself a great divine principle or quality. He wasthe Conveyor of Enlightenment to the world; He was the Lord of Light. As isalways the case, He re-enacted in Himself, for the instruction of His disciples,the processes of illumination and became the “Illumined One.” We are told in thescriptures of India that He achieved illumination under the tree, just as Christachieved the liberation of the human spirit upon the tree [411] set up onGolgotha. Light, wisdom, reason, as divine yet human attributes, were focussedin the Buddha. He proved the possibility of all men achieving this illuminationand of walking in the light. He challenged the people to tread the Path ofIllumination, of which wisdom, mental perception and intuition are the aspects.Then came the next great Teacher, the Christ. He embodied in Himself a stillgreater divine principle or aspect, that of Love, whilst at the same timeembracing within Himself all that the Buddha had of Light. Christ was theexpression of both Light and Love.Through Their work, therefore, there is now possible a deeper reaction to, and abroader comprehension of the work and influence of those great Lives Who arewaiting today to help humanity. The work of these two Sons of God produced amongmany results the following:1. They embodied in Themselves certain cosmic principles, and by Their work andsacrifice certain divine potencies poured through and upon the race, stimulatingintelligence into wisdom and emotion into love. The Buddha, when He achievedillumination, “let in” a flood of light upon life and world problems. Heformulated this revelation into the Four Truths. His group of disciples erecteda structure of truth which (by the power of collective thought) has floodedmankind with light.2. Through the message of the Buddha, man has for the first time grasped thecause of His constant distaste and dissatisfaction and has learnt that the Wayof Release is to be found in detachment, dispassion and discrimination. Wherethese are present, there is rapid release from the wheel of rebirth.3. Through the message of the Christ, three concepts emerge into the racialconsciousness:a. The value of the individual and the necessity for tensity of effort on hispart.b. The opportunity which was to be presented to humanity [412] to take atremendous step forward and undergo the new birth or the first initiation.c. The method whereby this next step could be taken in the new age, voiced forus in the words “love your neighbour as yourself.” Individual effort, groupopportunity and men’s identification with each other—such is the message of theChrist.In the message of the Buddha we have the three methods whereby the personalitycan be changed and prepared to be a conscious expression of divinity. Throughdetachment , the brain consciousness or state of awareness (embodying physicalrecognition of inner causes) is withdrawn or abstracted from the things of thesenses and from the calls of the lower nature. Detachment is in reality theimposition of a new rhythm or habit reaction upon the cells of the brain whichrenders the brain unaware of the lure of the world of sensory perception.Through dispassion , the emotional nature is rendered immune from the appeal ofthe senses and desire fails to deter the soul from its rightful task. Throughdiscrimination , the mind learns to select the good, the beautiful and the true,and to substitute these for the sense of “identification with the personality,”which is so characteristic of the majority of men. Personality holds so many inthrall. This has to go. These three attitudes, when correctly and sanely held,will organise the personality, bring in the rule of wisdom, and prepare thedisciple for initiation.Then follows the work of the Christ, resulting in an understanding of the valueof the individual and his self-initiated effort at release and illumination,with the objective of group goodwill. We learn to perfect ourselves in order tohave somewhat to sacrifice to the group, and thus enrich the group with ourindividual contribution. This is the first result of the activity of the ChristPrinciple in the life of the individual. Personality fades out in the glory ofthe soul, which (like the rising sun) blots out the darkness and irradiates thelower nature. This is the second [413] result, and is a group activity. The wordgoes forth to the initiates of the future: Lose sight of self in groupendeavour. Forget the self in group activity. Pass through the portal toinitiation in group formation and let the personality life be lost in the grouplife.The final result of the work of the Christ is to be found in our identificationwith the whole: individuality, initiation, and identification—these are theterms in which the message of the Christ can be summarised. He said, when onEarth: “I and my Father are One,” and in these words epitomised His entiremessage. I, the individual, through initiation, am identified with Deity.Therefore we have:1. The Buddha . . the method . Detachment, Dispassion, Discrimination.2. The Christ . . . the result . . Individualism, Initiation, Identification.It is interesting to note that the work of the Buddha is expressed in words allbeginning with the fourth letter of the alphabet, the letter D. The sense ofpersonality is achieved; the quaternary is transcended, and the Buddha gave usthe reason for this transmutation and the rules. The work of the Christ isexpressed for us in words beginning with the ninth letter of the alphabet, theletter I, and this number is the number of initiation. These things happen notidly but all have their underlying purpose.I have here very briefly and inadequately outlined the nature of two greatApproaches and two minor. These have prepared humanity for the third greatApproach which will bring the new revelation, with its realised consequences, ofa new heaven and a new earth. I would ask the orthodox theologian how heinterprets the words “a new heaven”? May it not signify an entirely newconception as to the world of spiritual realities and perhaps of the very natureof God Himself? May it not be possible that our present ideas of God as theUniversal Mind, as Love and as Will, may be enriched by a new idea and qualityfor which we have as yet no name or word and of which we have as yet [414] nofaintest understanding? Each of the three present concepts as to the divinenature—the Trinity—have been entirely new when first sequentially presented tohumanity.What this third major Approach will bring to humanity we do not and cannot know.It will bring about as definite results as did the two earlier Approaches. Forsome years now the spiritual Hierarchy has been drawing nearer to mankind, andthis is responsible for the great concepts of freedom which are so close to thehearts of men everywhere today and for which humanity is now fighting. As theMembers of the Hierarchy approach closer to us, the dream of brotherhood, offellowship, of world cooperation and of a peace (based upon right humanrelations) becomes clearer in our minds. As They draw nearer we vision a new andvital world religion, a universal faith, at-one in its basic idealism with thepast but different in its mode of expression.I have cited earlier the foundational truths upon which the new world religionwill rest. I would suggest that the theme of the coming religion will be that ofthe great Approaches themselves; that it will emphasise anew God’s love for manas evidenced in these divine Approaches, and also man’s response to God as theword goes forth: “Draw near to God and He will draw near to you”; that itwill—in its rites and ceremonies—be concerned with the invocative and evocativeside of spiritual appeal.Man invokes the divine Approach in two ways: by means of the inchoate, voicelessappeal or invocative cry of the masses, and also by the planned, definedinvocation of the spiritually oriented aspirants, the intelligently convincedworker, disciple and initiate—by all, in fact, who form the New Group of WorldServers.The science of invocation and evocation will take the place of what we now callprayer and worship. Be not disturbed by the use of the word “science.” It is notthe cold and heartless intellectual thing so oft depicted. It is in reality theintelligent organisation of spiritual energy and of the forces of love, and wheneffective, will evoke the response of spiritual Beings Who can again walk openly[415] among men and thus establish a close relation and a constant communicationbetween humanity and the spiritual Hierarchy.It will be obvious to you that as humanity, through its most advanced units,prepares for this next great Approach it must accept with faith and conviction(faith for the masses, and conviction for the knowers and the New Group of WorldServers) the premises stated above:1. The fact of God (God Transcendent)2. Man’s relationship to the divine (God Immanent)3. The fact of immortality4. The Brotherhood of man (God in expression)5. The existence of the Way to God6. The historicity of the two great Approaches and the possibility of a thirdand imminent Approach.It is here that the churches, if regenerated, can concentrate their efforts,cease perpetuating the outer and visible form, and begin to deal with thereality underlying all dogmas and doctrines. Upon these inner assurances manmust take his stand, and a study of them will reveal that the majority of theunthinking masses (an immense majority) do accept them hopefully and withdesire, though without any definite understanding, and that a steadilyincreasing minority also accept them with a full convinced awareness—anawareness that is the result of the transformation of hope into self-provenfact. In between these two extremes is a large group of questioning people; theyare not part of the unintelligent mass, nor are they yet either occultists,mystics or even aspirants. They question and seek conviction; they repudiatefaith as unintelligent, but long for a substitute; they are constantly emergingout of the mass of men and constantly moving forward in consciousness throughthe following of spiritual techniques, eventually taking their stand among thosewho can say with St. Paul: “I know Whom I have believed.” It is with thesetechniques that the true religious teaching should primarily concern itself.As we look ahead into the world of tomorrow and begin [416] to question whatstructure the faith of humanity should assume and what building the skill of theknowers will erect to house the religious spirit of man, three more fundamentaltruths appear to be emerging as necessary adjuncts to the revealed body oftruth:1. The demonstrated existence of a Spiritual Hierarchy, the life-purpose ofwhich is the good of humanity. The Members of the Hierarchy are seen to be theCustodians of the divine Plan and expressions of the Love of God.2. The development of the Science of Invocation and Evocation as a means andmethod of approach to divinity. This will grow out of the ancient habits ofprayer as used by the masses, and the practice of meditation as developed by themystics and occultists. Prayer and meditation are the preliminary steps to thisemerging science, and what is vaguely called “worship” is the group effort toestablish some form of united approach to the spiritual Hierarchy, functioningunder the guidance and control of the Christ and related to the highestspiritual centre, Shamballa, through its most advanced individuals, just ashumanity is related to the Hierarchy by its spiritually minded people.3. The realisation that the starry heavens, the solar system and the planetaryspheres are all of them the manifestations of great spiritual Lives and that theinterrelation between these embodied Lives is as real and effectual as is therelation between members of the human family.The spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, the ability of mankind to contact itsMembers and to work in cooperation with Them, and the existence of the greaterHierarchy of spiritual energies of which our tiny planetary sphere is apart—these are the three truths upon which the coming world religion may bebased.Relationship to God, through Christ, has ever been the teaching of the spiritualleaders of the world, no matter by what name they called Him. In the future weshall draw closer and more intelligently to the living substance of [417]Reality and be more definite in our apprehension of this hitherto vaguely sensedrelationship. We shall know and see and understand. We shall not just believe,have hope and try to comprehend. We shall speak openly of the Hierarchy and ofits Members and Their work. The hierarchical nature of all spiritual Lives, andthe fact of the great “chain of hierarchies” stretching all the way up from themineral kingdom through the human and the kingdom of God to apparently remotespiritual groups, will be emphasised. Then there will open for the spiritualLives what has been called “the Way of the Higher Evolution.” Much along theselines has been given out during the past two centuries. The fact of theexistence of the Hierarchy is consciously recognised by hundreds of thousandstoday, though still denied by the orthodox; the general public are familiar withthe idea of the existence of the Masters, and either gullibly accept the mass offutile and idiotic information handed out by many today or fight furiouslyagainst the spread of this teaching. Others are open-minded enough toinvestigate whether the teaching is true and to follow the techniques suggested,in the hope that hypothesis may turn to fact. This last group is steadilyincreasing in number and upon their accumulating evidence belief can betranslated into knowledge. So many know the truth today; so many people ofintegrity and worth are cooperating consciously with Members of this Hierarchythat the very foundations of the ecclesiastical antagonisms and the belittlingcomments of the concrete minded are of no avail. What the orthodox theologianand the narrow doctrinaire have to offer no longer satisfies the intelligentseeker or suffices to answer his questions; he is shifting his allegiances intowider and more spiritual areas. He is moving out from under doctrinal authorityinto direct personal, spiritual experience and coming under the direct authoritywhich contact with Christ and His disciples, the Masters, gives.In considering our second point, the Science of Invocation and Evocation, we arealso moving forward into the area of mental understanding. The grasping natureof [418] many of the prayers of men, based as they are upon desire forsomething, has long disturbed the intelligent; the vagueness of the meditationtaught and practised in the East and in the West, and its emphatically selfishnote (personal liberation and personal knowledge) are likewise causing a revolt.The demand today is for group work, group good, group knowledge, group contactwith the divine, group salvation, group understanding and group relationship toGod and the Spiritual Hierarchy. All this indicates progress.At this point it should be useful to repeat part of what I said elsewhereconcerning future developments along this line. (The Reappearance of the Christ,pages 152-159.)This new invocative work will be the keynote of the coming world religion andwill fall into two parts. There will be the invocative work of the masses of thepeople, trained by the spiritually minded people of the world (working in thechurches, whenever possible, under an enlightened clergy) to accept the fact ofthe approaching spiritual energies, focussed through the spiritual Hierarchy,and to voice their spiritual demand for light, liberation and understanding.There will also be the trained, scientific work of appeal and invocation aspractised by those who have trained their minds through right meditation, whoknow the uses of sound, of formulas and of invocation, and who can workconsciously, focussing the invocative cry of the masses and at the same timeusing certain great formulas of words which will later be given to the race, asThe Lord’s Prayer was given by the Christ and The Great Invocation has beengiven in this day and age.This new religious science (for which prayer, meditation and ritual have laidthe foundation) will train its students to present, at certain stated periodsthroughout the year, the voiced demand of the people of the world forrelationship with God and with each other. This work, when rightly carriedforward, will evoke response from the waiting Hierarchy; through this response,the belief of the masses will gradually be changed into the conviction of theknowers. In this way humanity will be transformed and spiritualised. [419] Thenwill begin, as the ages pass away, the regeneration of material nature, with thetwo spiritual centres—the Hierarchy and Humanity—working together in fullconsciousness and understanding. The Kingdom of God will be functioning onEarth.It will be apparent to you that I can indicate only the broad general outlinesof the new world religion. The expansion of the human consciousness which willtake place as a result of the coming great Approach will enable man to grasp notonly his relation to the spiritual Life of our planet, the “One in Whom we liveand move and have our being,” but will also give him a glimpse of the relationof our planet to the circle of planetary lives moving within the orbit of theSun, and the still greater circle of spiritual Influences which contact oursolar system as it pursues its orbit in the Heavens (the twelve constellationsof the zodiac). Astronomical and astrological investigation has demonstratedthis relationship and the influences exerted, but there is still speculation andmuch foolish claiming and interpretation. Yet the churches have ever recognisedthis relationship, and the Bible has testified to it. “The stars in theircourses fought against Sisera”; “Who can withstand the sweet influences of thePleiades?”; and many other passages bear out this contention of the Knowers.Many church festivals are fixed by reference to the moon or a zodiacalconstellation. Investigation will prove this to be increasingly the case, andwhen the ritual of the new world religion is universally established this willbe one of the important factors considered.The establishing of certain major festivals in relation to the moon, and in alesser degree to the zodiac, will bring a strengthening of the spirit ofinvocation and the resultant inflow of responsive influences. The truth lyingbehind all invocation is based upon the power of thought, particularly in itstelepathic nature, rapport and aspect. The unified invocative thought of themasses and the focussed, directed thought of the New Group of World Serversconstitute an outgoing stream of energy. This will reach telepathically [420]those spiritual Beings Who are sensitive and responsive to such impacts. Theirevoked response, sent out as spiritual energy, will in turn reach humanity,after having been stepped down into thought energy, and in that form will makeits due impact upon the minds of men, convincing them and carrying inspirationand revelation. Thus has it ever been in the history of the spiritual unfoldmentof the world and in the procedure followed in writing the world Scriptures.Secondly, the establishing of a certain uniformity in the world religiousrituals will aid men everywhere to strengthen each other’s work and enhancepowerfully the thought currents directed to the waiting Spiritual Lives. Atpresent, the Christian religion has its great festivals, the Buddhist keeps hisdifferent set of spiritual events, and the Hindu has still another list of holydays. In the future world, when organised, all men of spiritual inclination andintention everywhere will keep the same holy days. This will bring about apooling of spiritual resources and a united spiritual effort, plus asimultaneous spiritual invocation. The potency of this will be apparent.Let me indicate the possibilities of such spiritual events, and prophesy thenature of the coming world-wide Festivals. There will be three such majorFestivals each year, concentrated in three consecutive months, and leadingtherefore to a prolonged spiritual effort which will affect the remainder of theyear. These will be:1. The Festival of Easter. This is the festival of the risen, living Christ, theTeacher of all men and the Head of the Spiritual Hierarchy. He is the Expressionof the Love of God. On this day the Spiritual Hierarchy which He guides anddirects will be recognised, and the nature of God’s love will be emphasised.This festival is determined always by the date of the first Full Moon of spring,and is the great Western and Christian festival.2. The Festival of Wesak. This is the festival of the Buddha, the spiritualIntermediary between the highest [421] spiritual centre, Shamballa, and theHierarchy. The Buddha is the Expression of the Wisdom of God, the Embodiment ofLight, and the Indicator of the divine Purpose. This will be fixed annually inrelation to the Full Moon of May, as is at present the case. It is the greatEastern festival.3. The Festival of Goodwill . This will be the festival of the spirit ofhumanity—aspiring towards God, seeking conformity with the Will of God anddedicated to the expression of right human relation. This will be fixed annuallyin relation to the Full Moon of June. It will be a day whereon the spiritual anddivine nature of mankind will be recognised. On this festival, for two thousandyears, the Christ has represented humanity and has stood before the Hierarchyand in the sight of Shamballa as the God-Man, the Leader of His people and “theEldest in a great family of brothers” (Romans VIII:29). Each year at that timeHe has preached the last sermon of the Buddha before the assembled Hierarchy.This will therefore be a festival of deep invocation and appeal, of a basicaspiration towards fellowship, of human and spiritual unity, and will representthe effect in the human consciousness of the work of the Buddha and of theChrist.These three festivals are already being kept throughout the world, though theyare not as yet related to each other, and as part of the unified spiritualApproach of humanity. The time is coming when all three festivals will be keptsimultaneously throughout the world, and by their means a great spiritual unitywill be achieved and the effects of the great Approach so close to us at thistime will be stabilised by the united invocation of humanity throughout theplanet.The remaining full moons will constitute lesser festivals, but will berecognised to be also of vital importance. They will establish the divineattributes in the consciousness of man, just as the major festivals establishthe three divine aspects. These aspects and qualities will be arrived at anddetermined by a close study of the nature of a particular [422] constellation orconstellations influencing those months. For instance, Capricorn (December) willcall attention to the first initiation, the birth of the Christ in the cave ofthe heart, and indicate the training needed to bring about that great spiritualevent in the life of the individual man. I give this one instance to you inorder to indicate the possibilities for spiritual unfoldment that could be giventhrough an understanding of these influences, and in order to revivify theancient faiths by expanding them into their larger undying relationships.We have, therefore, the following:Shamballa the Will aspect of God Wesak May Full Moon (Taurus) Hierarchy the Loveaspect of God Easter April Full Moon (Aries) Humanity divine IntelligenceGoodwill June Full Moon (Gemini)The remaining nine Full Moons will be concerned with the divine characteristicsand their development in mankind.Thus the twelve festivals will constitute a revelation of divinity. They willpresent a means of bringing about relationship, first of all during three monthswith the three great spiritual centres, the three expressions of the divineTrinity. The minor festivals will emphasise the inter-relation of the Whole,thus lifting the divine presentation out of the individual and the personal intothat of the universal divine Purpose; the relationship of the Whole to the partand of the part to that Whole will be thereby fully expressed.Humanity will therefore invoke the spiritual power of the Kingdom of God, theHierarchy; the Hierarchy will respond, and God’s plans will then be worked outon Earth. The Hierarchy, on a higher turn of the spiral, will invoke the centreof God’s Will, Shamballa or Shangri-Lha, thus invoking the Purpose of God. Thuswill the Will of God be implemented by Love and manifested intelligently; forthis mankind is ready, and for this the Earth waits. [423]~FACTORS IN THE WORLD SITUATIONApril 1944I have written to the world aspirants for many Wesaks now. I have again andagain brought to your attention and theirs the close relation which is beingestablished between the world of men and the world of souls. I have again andagain pointed out that, under the Law of Evolution, certain great fusions,at-one-ments or great Approaches are taking place. I have indicated that thepresent activity of our planetary Logos is bringing certain major adjustmentswithin the planetary sphere of influence and that these primarily affect thehuman kingdom. I have called to your notice the urgency of the incoming life,producing tension, spiritual recognitions of a far-reaching nature, theimmediate overthrow of false Gods and standards, and the destruction of outwornand crystallised interpretations (called doctrines) of the spiritual realities.By these means, the way is cleared for a new and simple recognition of divinitywhich will satisfy not only the heart of the simplest person, but which willmeet the need of the most intelligent. I have talked in terms of the union ofEastern and Western thought and of the need for the great civilisations—nurturedunder the influence of Shri Krishna, the Buddha and the Christ—to be broughtcloser together. I have said (and I here re-affirm) that He Who comes will makethis union possible and effective. This event will evoke world-wide recognition.I have stated also that we are reaching a climaxing period in human history; inthis period the Lords of Karma are unusually active; the Law of Cause and Effectis bringing the results of past activities, the subjective thinking and thesecret impulses to the surface, and exacting penalty and the planned cleaning ofthe slate of human history. When He Whom all disciples serve was on Earth twothousand years ago, He said that secret things would be made plain; by thisemergence of the good and of the bad into prominence, men will arrive atknowledge, at understanding, and will be forced to take those steps which willbe needed to [424] build a new and better world, based on the Law of Love andnot on the Law of Separateness and hate. This is what is happening today.I have said also that the Forces of Light are nearing the Earth and that theHierarchy is coming steadily closer to mankind.These basic events, these subjective happenings and these spiritualdeterminations—under the Law of Action and Reaction—have evoked a more rapidresponse from the Forces of Evil (present in our planetary life) than fromhumanity. Certain great Forces or embodied Energies of darkness and of evilorganised themselves and took the needed steps (so they believed) to preventhumanity from stepping onward into light. They availed themselves of theweaknesses, the selfishness and the self-interest of man; just as good canstimulate the latent goodness in mankind into expression, so evil can evokegreater evil from those susceptible from innate weakness, and from theunthinking and emotional: the Forces of Light work only with men’s souls. Lies,false teaching, evil propaganda, a war of nerves, the culture of fear, theorganisation of groups and of isolated workers in every nation pledged toundermine righteousness and distort the truth, went rapidly forward. Great andfundamental truths were twisted to meet the ends of the evil workers.The doctrine, for instance, of the super-race was interpreted to mean thesuperiority of the German nation and culture to all in the West, whilst thedivinity of the Sons of Heaven (the Japanese race) was emphasised to all in theEast. The bewildered peoples of both nations were led to believe that they had agreat and spiritual mission to dominate the world.This was the first result of the approach of the Kingdom of God to the earth, orrather to the physical plane. In that kingdom men of all races will demonstratetheir divinity; the kingdom of souls will be recognised as the universal homeand race of all men. Separative nationalities will, in that kingdom, have noplace or recognition.[425] The Forces of Evil sought for those leaders and groups who are thematerialistic correspondence to the spiritual leaders and those who seek toguide humanity along right lines. They took possession (and I use this word withdeliberation) of the evil men who led the Axis Powers—Hitler, Tojo, Goebbels,Ribbentrop, Himmler and—to a much lesser degree—Mussolini, Hess, Goering andothers. They completely overpowered the minds of these men, already distortedwith ambition and sadistic inclinations. Who, you ask, do I mean by “they”? Imean those intelligent evil, unloving, hateful Individualities who are to theworld of selfish and material focus what the Hierarchy of Masters, working underthe Christ, are to struggling human aspirants. The power of these evil forces isenormous, for they recognise no restrictions or ordinary decent, humanlimitations; they work through violence, coercion, cruelty, hate, terror andlies; they aim to subjugate the human consciousness through the complete controlof men’s minds, through the withholding of good and the promulgation of evil.They stimulate the brains of men through the extent of their evil and magicalknowledge; I mean this literally and physically. The Great White Lodge, workingunder the inspiration of the Christ and of Shamballa, functions necessarilyunder certain spiritual restrictions. Coercion is not permitted; the minds ofmen must be and are left free; the stimulation of the souls of men is permitted,because it results in the stimulation of the expression of love and ofunderstanding, leading to right human relations. These spiritual restrictionsgreatly slow down the progress of the Forces of Light; it should interest you toremember that the length of the war was partly dependent upon the inability ofthe Armies of the Lord to commit the crimes for which the Axis Powers have beenresponsible. The physical activities of the Forces of Light do recognise certainlimitations, and of this the Forces of Evil take constant advantage. The bombingof massed populations was started by Hitler and could have been ended by himimmediately if he so chose.[426] There is another aspect of this matter to which I would like to call yourattention. These restrictions which the Forces of Light recognise have also anundesirable effect where the unintelligent and well-meaning are concerned, andwhere those who are emotionally polarised interpret the Law of Love. The UnitedNations, working for human liberation and freedom (and therefore working underthe Law of Love, rightly understood) is prevented from following the lines ofindiscriminate cruelty which characterised the German and Japanese techniques:torture, starvation, lying propaganda, misuse of prisoners, the dissemination ofa terror campaign. These are not permitted by the rules of the Brothers ofHumanity. From a purely physical angle, this can be interpreted as putting the“Armies of the Lord” at a disadvantage. It is this right attitude on the part ofthe Forces of Light which has an undesirable effect upon the appeasers andpacifists of the world. These would, for humanitarian reasons and from love ofthe forms through which humanity functions, bring the war to an immediate end.In their well-meaning blindness they would sacrifice the future of humanity andthe lives of millions of people at a later date for a temporary cessation ofhostilities. I would emphasise to you that the Forces of Evil must be defeatednow ; the evil leaders must be wrenched from their high place, and the completedefeat and annihilation of those responsible for launching this horror onhumanity is an absolute necessity and bounden duty, if security, well-being anda new order of happier living is to be the lot of coming generations. Atemporary ending of the war would only give time for the Forces of Evil toreorganise, and the future war would be infinitely worse than this one. This theintelligent humanitarian is saying, and this is the opinion of the Hierarchy.The Hierarchy stands firmly on the side of those who demand a war to a finish,and the reasons are the ultimate saving of millions of lives and thepreservation of certain basic spiritual values.The issue is far more serious spiritually than you know; [427] the work of theHierarchy is handicapped not only by the restrictions under which the Forces ofLight must work, but also by the work and utterances of the silly little menwith small vision who see not the future possibilities if the war came to aninconclusive finish, and who (for the present comfort of the present generation)would sacrifice the children of tomorrow and later generations. The work of theHierarchy is handicapped by the attitudes of men with no perspective and muchselfishness, of no cruelty but of stupid thinking. These men—in the houses oflegislature in the various United Nations, in Parliament, in Congress, and inthe churches—plead for the cessation of the war before victory is won and beforethe enemies of humanity are beaten to their knees in supplication for mercy andin a demand for peace. They see the end of business as they have known it; theysee the familiar landmarks of their comfortable world disappearing; they dislikethe results of the war as it affects them; or they cannot bear the generalsuffering and prompted by pity they demand an immediate peace. Others areprompted by isolationism and the desire to withdraw from participation in themisery of war; others hate those whose duty it is to carry the war to asuccessful climax, or see their particular ambitions threatened by theconditionings of a changing world. They would sacrifice future generations, as Ihave said above, to their short-sighted policy and feeble judgment. They spreaddisunity, therefore, and shackle the hands of those administering in highplaces. Their efforts prolong the war, dishearten the fighting forces, breakdown national and military morale, and lay a poor foundation for the work of thepost-war world. There are many of these in every nation, there are too many inthe United States of America; there are none in the U.S.S.R., and hence hertriumphant march forward.You have, consequently, in the world today:1. The Forces of Evil, working through Germany and Japan. To date, they areholding their own and they are not yet defeated. They are terrorising the world.Within [428] their own national borders they do not possess enough people withcourage, understanding, or with the ability to think clearly, who hate evil andwho can hold to a vision. There is little in either nation to bring assistanceto the Forces of Light. The Germans were deceived from the beginning, and awidespread national deception, backed by a terror campaign, argues a generalweakness, lack of courage and a natural predilection for evil guidance. Thetendency to be led along aggressive, selfish and evil lines has beencharacteristic of the German mentality for a great length of time. This negativenation, with its arrogant psychology (one of the great paradoxes of the ages),must be taught the ways of positive good, and a courageous championing ofrighteousness must take the place of the present negative acceptance of evil.With humility and intelligence must the German nation be taught to take a properplace in the community of nations. The Japanese nation, in spite of its greatage, must go back into the nursery state; it must be taught, as children aretaught, to be social and not anti-social, and it will be long before it will besafe to trust this nation. The Italian nation presents no greater problem thandoes any other nation in the world. It is normal, as are the United Nations; theGerman nation and the Japanese race are not normal, and must be brought back tonormality by careful, kindly, but firm handling, and by applied educationalprocesses.2. The Forces of Light. I would here correct an impression which exists amongesotericists. By this phrase, (the Forces of Light), they are apt to mean thatthe Hierarchy is literally fighting against the Axis nations. This is not so inthe physical sense. The Hierarchy works—as you well know—with the souls of menand with those minds which are so oriented and disposed that they react to soulimpression. When I use the expression “the Forces of Light” I mean thoseenlightened nations upon whom the light of Freedom shines and who will refuse,at all costs, to relinquish that light. There is no freedom in Germany or in[429] Japan. In a lesser sense and for a brief time, there was no freedom inItaly, but Italy must be counted among the enlightened nations, for it could notbe held in duress. The Forces of Light comprise those nations (working throughtheir armies and in the diplomatic arena) who are today fighting for the freedomof humanity, for the eternal rights of man, for liberty of conscience, for theposition of the individual in any nation, and for freedom of religion or theright of man’s self-chosen approach to the spiritual realities. Behind thesenations stands the Hierarchy. Freedom is the birthright of mankind, and freewill is the highest of the divine characteristics. Freedom is misinterpreted andmisused by many, owing to the point in evolution of the mass of humanity, but itis a fundamental, divine principle; and where principles are involved theHierarchy knows no compromise. There is no spiritual principle behind any of theactivities of the Axis Powers, behind German activity or Japanese aggression.Therefore, the Hierarchy does not stand with power or strength behind any oftheir efforts.3. Humanity as a whole. The men, women and children of the world are allimplicated in and affected by this universal war. The effects reach into themost isolated village, the most extensive desert and the highest mountain top,as well as into the cities and congested areas of all the nations. No one isexempt from the consequences of this present catastrophe. The bulk of humanityare universal and innocent sufferers. The majority scarcely realise what it isall about; they view this great historical climax from the purely self-centredangle and from the point of view of how it affects them as individuals and theirnation as a whole. An increasing number are coming to realise that this war mustbe fought to a successful finish because there is no peace or hope or rightworld relationships as long as two nations—one in the Western hemisphere and theother in the Eastern—can precipitate disaster upon countless millions. Aminority are realising that the war has precipitated the condensed evil of theages and that humanity is faced with the opportunity [430] of erasing pasterrors, ancient selfishness and ingrained wickedness, and of inaugurating a newand better world. In this new world there will be freedom of approach to God,opportunity for individual expression, freedom to live in right relations andscope for creative living. A few—a very few—know that this is a climaxing pointin an ancient conflict between Christ with His Hierarchy of Masters, and“spiritual wickedness in high places.” A mere handful of knowers and disciplesknow, past all controversy and discussion, that, heading up those unhappylands—Germany and Japan—are ancient leaders who have again sought to bringplanetary disaster and to deflect the ends and the aims of the Great WhiteLodge.Among all these are thousands who stand bewildered, sensing the truth butfeeling helpless in the face of the gigantic horror which the evil gang nowruling Germany has precipitated upon humanity. They tend to right thinking butare still the prey of the unscrupulous and the selfish. When their thinking hasbeen guided into right lines through a process of right presentation of thesituation, they will constitute a powerful asset to the Forces of Light.Such is the situation with which the Hierarchy and humanity is today faced. Thestrength of the Forces of Light is growing; the power of the Forces of Darknessmay be waning but is still vastly strong—upon the physical plane. Their mainhold is upon the minds of men and that is exceedingly potent and unweakened, forit is aided by the mild, unthinking person, by the bewildered, the pacifist, theappeaser and the isolationist. The idealism of this group is turned to the aidof Germany by the skilful evil workers. The German armies are still unbeaten;central Europe is a mighty fortress, dominated by the arch enemy of mankind,sitting on his mountain-top. There, symbolically, he is to be found, theinitiator into evil conditions, and into slavery. The armies of the Lord standpoised, and victory will be theirs when there is complete unity of purpose,concentrated attention upon right human relations, and a [431] spread ofidealistic aspiration to all who are fighting this battle for freedom. For thisunity of purpose all the enlightened people of the world must work. It is notyet adequately present.Let us now turn to the work of the Hierarchy and to the event for which allinitiates and disciples are now preparing—the coming Wesak Festival.~THE TASK OF IMPLEMENTING THE WILL-TO-GOODMay 1944How is the Hierarchy working at this time? In what manner are the Masters aidingthe work of the Forces of Light? Can something of moment and of lastingsignificance happen at this coming May Full Moon? How do the Masters look at theworld situation? What are Their plans? Can these plans be materialised? And whatcan the individual disciple, initiate and world disciple accomplish in the faceof humanity’s dilemma?These are all normal and intelligent questions and can be answered partially,though not fully, owing to three reasons:1. The outcome of the coming climaxing conflict depends on humanity itself. Agreater effort is required, particularly in America—an effort to see the issuesclearly, to understand the causes of this war, and a determination to take thosesteps—through propaganda and discussion—which will clarify the minds of themasses. Into these age-long causes I cannot here go; there is not time to domore than enumerate certain of thema. Universal and ancient selfishness, materialism, aggression, and nationalprides. Of these faults all nations have been guilty.b. A sense of separateness of which the border issue between such nations asRussia and Poland is symbolic. The need of humanity and its general well-beingcomes [432] eternally first. Nations and their ephemeral disputes are ofsecondary interest.c. A tendency—centuries old—among the Germanic peoples to dominate, to take whatis not their own, to regard themselves as unique, superior, and as embodying asuper-race; there is also a fixed determination, on behalf of their owninterests, to plunge other nations and races into war. Today they have achieveda planetary war.2. There are factors present in this battle between evil and good which are sodeeply esoteric and hidden from the understanding of the most advanced humanbeing that it is useless for me to enlarge upon their existence. They areconcerned with the ability of the mind, or of the mind principle, to react totruth or to lies; the mystery of this reaction is hidden in the evolutionaryprocess itself. A point can be reached in human development where acceptance ofdeception is impossible and clear thinking is normal. The potency of glamour(which holds so many people in prison) is related to this mystery. Glamour holdsnot those who are mentally and emotionally undeveloped; they are completerealists and see life in its bare outlines and baldly. The highly developed arenot subject to glamour; they also think realistically but this time with truemental perception and not instinctively. The thinking man, in his process oftraining, but who is still largely governed by his emotions, is exceedinglyprone to glamour, and very often to the glamour of a sentimental so-calledloving attitude. These people do not realise that love is a process ofdetermining action on the basis of the ultimate good of the individual or thegroup, and that the immediate reactions of the personality are secondary. Inthis conflict the Hierarchy is concerned with the final issue, with the futurewelfare and the ultimate well-being of humanity. They are not so concerned withthe immediate suffering and pain of the personalities involved. Is this a hardsaying? A tiny replica of this correct attitude can be found in the influence,words and actions of those wise parents, those far-sighted guides [433] ofyouth, who see the need of discipline if their children are in the future to berightly oriented, and to live correctly. The temporary discomfort of thediscipline and the rebellion of the children do not in any way condition suchparents. They see ahead.3. The conflict at present involving humanity has its source not only in humanweakness and selfishness, but in a situation which has existed for ages betweenthe Great White Lodge of Masters and the Lodge of Black Adepts. This started inAtlantean times and must now be fought out to a finish. With the details of thisstruggle (fought on mental levels) you have no concern, except in so far as youand the rest of mankind react to lies or to truth. Two streams of mental energyor of thought-directed ideas impinge powerfully at this time upon the humanconsciousness. One is embodied in the lying propaganda emanating from the AxisPowers and affecting potently not only their own peoples but the selfishpoliticians, the intolerant and the racially conditioned people, and thewell-intentioned but short-sighted appeasers and pacifists. The second stream isembodied in the idealism, the humanitarianism, and the clear presentation of thefactual situation which characterise the best minds in every nation and whichcondition the thinking of the leaders of the United Nations; this stream has,for instance, conditioned the attitude and the changed orientation of theU.S.S.R., and has brought them to a position of cooperation and to arelinquishing of some of their separative ideas.The leader of the conflict against evil in high places is the Christ, the Headof the Hierarchy. What is the attitude of the Christ at this time? In allreverence, and as one of His humblest friends and personal workers, I ampermitted to tell you a little of His position as He nears the great event inMay of this year. He knows Himself to be the inner spiritual Commander of theArmies of the Lord. His is the responsibility of awakening the souls of men totheir presented opportunity and to the need of bringing [434] to an end thisancient conflict between the Lords of Evil and the Messengers of Light. His hasbeen the problem of teaching humanity that, in order to demonstrate true loveand to provide scope and opportunity for a civilisation in which love,brotherhood and right human relations are governing factors, those essentialsteps must be taken which will accomplish this.He said when He was on earth two thousand years ago, “I came not to bring peace,but a sword.” The sword of the spirit is wielded by the Hierarchy, and by itsmeans cosmic evil is arrested; the sword of discrimination is wielded by theinitiates and the disciples of the world, and by its means the distinctionbetween good and evil, with a consequent presentation of free choice between thetwo, has been laid before humanity, and the lines of demarcation have been madeabundantly clear in this world war. It had been the hope of the Christ and thelonging of all the Masters that men would see clearly and make free and rightchoice, so that—without physical plane warfare—they would bring about the neededchanges and the ending of wrong conditions. But the conflict descended on to thephysical plane and the sword of material war (symbolically speaking) was takenup by humanity.Forget not (particularly those of you who are outraged by physical conflictthrough your pacifist inclinations) that, in the West, it was Germany whichfirst of all took the sword in hand, marching into Poland and bringing misery,devastation and cruelty to a smaller and much weaker nation, thus forcing Franceand Great Britain to fulfil their pledged obligations to that little nation andto declare war upon the aggressor. It was Japan who brought war into the Easternhemisphere. The Forces of Light were left with no alternative but to fight indefense of freedom.Prior to the war, the Hierarchy did what it could to change the trend of humanliving and thinking, awakening the consciences of the intelligent, stimulatingthe activity of the humanitarians and impressing the minds of Their disciples inorder to arouse goodwill, a driving desire for [435] right human relations andpeaceful conditions. But the movement was not strong enough; the sword appearedon earth and mankind was plunged into war.Since then the work of impressing the minds of the world disciples and of thosewhom they can influence has been along the lines of clarifying the issues,making plain that for which we fight, and arousing men and women to take suchaction as will, once and for all, end the possibility of a similar worldcataclysm.The activities of our Master, the Christ, fall into three categories:1. Stiffening the will to fight on behalf of the spiritual issues and for thegreat humanitarian aims of the Hierarchy.2. Impressing the minds of diplomats, thinkers and lovers of mankind to work outnow certain post-war plans which will entirely change our present civilisationand bring about the new.3. Arousing the minds of the masses and turning them—each in his own place andmanner—into a more religious channel. The growth of spiritual desire andaspiration is phenomenal today, could you but see the indications as the workerson the inner side do.Our Master, the Christ, is also at this time carrying forward three majoractivities. I can tell you briefly what they are, but only the disciples of theworld will grasp the true implications.He is, first of all, occupied with the process of deflecting the will-energy,emanating from Shamballa, in such a way that it will not be seized upon andmisused by the Axis Powers in order to stiffen their peoples into increasedopposition to the Forces of Light. It must be rechannelled and used to stiffenthe purpose of the United Nations to carry the war to a finish of victory and oftriumph, to increase the will-to-unity of all the allied peoples and to makefirm the intention of the post-war planners that freedom, educationalfacilities, truth and right living shall be [436] the lot of the incominggeneration. This necessitates on the part of the Christ a concentration forwhich we have no equivalent word and a purely spiritual endeavour (a monadiceffort) of which we have no faintest idea.Secondly, He is working within the confines of the Hierarchy itself, preparingHis disciples, the Masters, for certain great post-war events. For the war willend. The Restoration of the Mysteries, the initiation of those disciples whohave stood firm and unafraid during the war, the enlargement of Their ashrams,owing to the almost unforeseen development of the spiritual sense among theworld aspirants who would not normally have become disciples during thisincarnation, and also the externalisation of Their ashrams during the next onehundred years, preparatory to the reappearance of the Hierarchy upon earth, aresome of His present hierarchical responsibilities. These involve a tremendousexpenditure of force, of second ray energy, just as His first activity demandsan unusual expenditure of first ray power—something which even He, in His highplace, is only now learning to handle, as a pledged Disciple of Sanat Kumara.His third activity is the effort to offset the growing hate in the world, tostrengthen the trend towards unity, and to show people everywhere the danger ofseparateness. A growing and (from the worldly point of view) reasonable hatredof the German people and of the Japanese is steadily rising. This hate they havebrought upon themselves. Hate ever lacks discrimination. The great Law ofSpiritual Retribution requires that justice be meted out, but hatred will closethe eyes of justice. The law must be administered, and the world will see theexpression of that same law, stated in the words, “Whatsoever a man soweth, thatshall he also reap.” But the materialistic law of hate and of separation must benegated and offset. The problem with which the Christ is faced is wellnigh—fromthe human angle—insoluble. He will require the united effort of all men ofgoodwill to stem the rising tide of hate—the floodgates of which were opened byGermany when she began her attacks upon the [437] Jews; she is now in danger ofdrowning in the waters which she has set loose. There is also a rising tendencyto separation among certain of the Allied Nations, with which the Christ mustdeal. Several of them are as houses divided against themselves. Such are Poland,France, Yugoslavia and Greece. How can their differences be reconciled?The hate of those who have suffered at the hands of the Axis Powers, or as aresult of war conditions, must be offset. How can this be done? Such are some ofthe problems with which the Christ is wrestling. He must work through Hisdisciples, and They must be trained. He must work through the stimulation of thehearts of the intelligent people and of the humanitarians everywhere. He mustpour out the life-giving energy of the Christ-life on a wide scale throughoutthe entire world, and do so in the midst of those conditions wherein humanreceptivity and sensitivity are at their lowest point, owing to the numbnesswhich comes through intense suffering. He stands in His place unmoved andunafraid, with clear perception of the truth and spiritual insight into the truesituation. In collaboration with His great Brother, the Buddha, He is preparingfor the next step.Today the Hierarchy is facing a climaxing activity. From the Full Moon of May,1944, until the Full Moon of May, 1945, the Members of the Hierarchy willunitedly be putting forth Their maximum effort to close the door upon the Forcesof Evil, to direct the Shamballa energy (now let loose upon the world) so thatits destructive aspect may be transmuted or directed towards the stimulationwhich will result in the rebuilding of the world. This will then affect not onlythe Members of the Hierarchy, but all on Earth who respond to hierarchicalimpression. Have the following statement in mind:The focussed and concentrated work of the Hierarchy at the time of the Full Moonof May, 1944 is—by Their united effort, Their blended thought and Theirillumined will power, under the trained guidance of [438] the Buddha and theChrist—to withdraw the energy of the will-to-separation and aggression (adistortion of first ray energy) away from the Forces of Evil and channel itagain, via the Hierarchy; it will then demonstrate as the Will-to-Good, and thiswill express itself via the men of goodwill on Earth. This requires a great Actof Absorption by the Hierarchy.The Buddha will start the process at the time of His appearance, through the useof a great first ray mantram. This can be used only by someone of His initiatestanding and in collaboration with the Lord of the World. He will therebydeflect the Shamballa force which the Adepts of the Black Lodge have turnedloose into the Axis nations; this has been made possible by their receptivity tothe will-to-power. He will “corral” it (if I may use such a colloquial andinappropriate term) and will place it at the disposal of the Christ. Thereception and the acceptance of this first ray energy will require a tremendouseffort upon the part of the Christ, the Custodian of the energy of the secondRay of Love-Wisdom. It is for this “reception” that He started to prepare at thetime of the April Full Moon.I have told you elsewhere that this direct impact of the Shamballa energy uponhumanity very seldom occurs. It has been loosed only three times during theentire history of the human kingdom. At other times, it makes its impactdirectly upon the Hierarchy, and is then transmuted or stepped down so thathumanity can take it. The three times it has been directed, unimpeded anduntransmuted, towards humanity are:1. At the time of the individualisation of animal-man when the mind principlewas implanted. This was the birth hour of the human soul.2. In Atlantean days when the power of the Black Lodge was so great that defeatfaced the Hierarchy and the destruction of the human soul. Shamballa theninterfered, and the world of that time was [439] destroyed. This period isrecognised in modern history as the time of the Great Flood.3. Today, once again, the Powers of Darkness are attempting to destroy humanityand the spiritual values. The power of Shamballa was let loose, destroying oldforms—political, social and religious—but at the same time this power was seizedupon by the evil forces to destroy the souls of men, to precipitate war and todestroy the cities and all our centres of civilisation and culture. The firstphase or form of destruction was directed by the disciples, the aspirants andthe clear thinking people of the world, and this was needed and very good. Theold social, political and religious forms were stultifying the human soul andhandicapping all progress. The second phase or form of destruction was directedby evil, and was focussed through those nations who had succumbed to the glamourof superiority, to the temptation of material aggression and to intolerantracial hatreds, implemented by cruelty and barbarism.The time has now come when this divine energy must express itself through thesecond aspect of the will-to-good, and not through the first aspect, thewill-to-power. Mankind has had to be shown that it is not yet ready for power,because the will-to-good is not adequately strong to balance this first aspectof the will.This then is the task of the Christ and of the Buddha at the time of the MayFull Moon—to channel and redirect the Shamballa force. If They can do this, theresult will be a new realisation and accomplishment of the will-to-good by theNew Group of World Servers, under the receptive guidance of the world disciplesand a responsive activity of the men and women of goodwill.Therefore, get this clearly in mind, so that your cooperation can be intelligentand rightly directed.First, at the time of the May Full Moon, the Buddha [440] will sound out a greatmantram and become the “absorbing Agent” of the first ray force. He will use themagnetic power of the second ray to attract this force to Himself and will holdit steady, prior to redirecting it. The Christ will then—on behalf of theHierarchy—become the “receiving Agent” of this potent energy, and the sevengroups of Masters Who work with the human and sub-human kingdoms will (inresponse to His demand) become the “directing Agents” for the sevenfoldexpression of this force.Second, at the time of the June Full Moon, the Hierarchy, under the guidance ofthe Christ, will let loose this will-to-good upon humanity, producing sevengreat results, according to the seven subrays of this first Ray of Will orPower:1. Power will be given to the disciples of the world and the initiates amongmen, so that they can direct efficiently and wisely the coming process ofrebuilding.2. The will-to-love will stimulate the men of goodwill everywhere so that hatredwill gradually be overcome and men will seek to live together cooperatively.This will take some time, but the inner urge is there and subject tostimulation.3. The will-to-action will lead intelligent people throughout the world toinaugurate those activities which will lay the foundation for a new, better andhappier world.4. The will-to-cooperate will steadily increase also. Men will desire and demandright human relations—a result more general than that produced by the activityof the first three aspects of this ray, but which will be a natural outcome ofthis activity.5. The will-to-know and to think correctly and creatively will become anoutstanding characteristic of the masses. Knowledge is the first step towardswisdom.6. The will-to-persist (which is an aspect of devotion and idealism) will becomea human characteristic—a sublimation of the basic instinct of self-preservation.This will [441] lead to a persistent belief in the ideals presented by theHierarchy, and the demonstration of immortality.7. The will-to-organise will further a building process which will be carriedforward under the direct inspiration of the Hierarchy. The medium will be thepotency of the will-to-good of the New Group of World Servers and the responsivegoodwill of mankind.I have expressed in these few simple terms the results of the planneddetermination of the two Great Lords which must take shape and emerge at thetime of the May and June Full Moons. What they succeed in doing will take yearsto demonstrate, but the end is inevitable once the right direction of thewill-to-good has been achieved. This demonstration is dependent, however, upontwo things:1. The focussed work of the Christ and of the Hierarchy during the coming year,until May 1945.2. The reflective thinking and careful planning of the New Group of WorldServers during the same period.Much outer activity upon a planetary scale will not be possible till 1945, butmuch can then become possible if hierarchical requirements are met. A year ofpreparation for the tremendous task of implementing the will-to-good and ofproducing a better civilisation and way of life is short indeed.The Christ has gone into retreat for a month and cannot be reached even by theMasters until May 5th. He is in closest consultation with the Buddha and withthe Lord of the World. This great Triangle of Potencies—the Lord of Will orPower, the Lord of Wisdom, and the Lord of Love—are today entirely preoccupiedwith the task of bringing the war to an end, and therefore with the task ofneutralising the destroyer aspect of the first ray. This They will do byimplementing the will-to-good by means of the wisdom of which the Buddha is theexperienced Custodian, and also by laying down those plans whereby the Christmay—via the Hierarchy and the New Group of World [442] Servers—bring about that“loving understanding” (esoterically understood and bearing little resemblanceto what is usually understood by those words) in the hearts of men. When thisTriangle of Energies has synchronised its efforts, then at the May Full Moon,the great task of leading humanity into the light of a new day can be begun.In the meantime, the Masters and Their ashrams are likewise getting ready toimplement these plans and are endeavouring to inspire Their disciples with thesame vision and objectives, so that they too may be prepared to play their duepart.Such, my brothers, is the situation as regards the position of humanity and theintentions and work of the Hierarchy. What then is the work which you can andmust do?I have for years indicated certain lines of activity which we, the Teachers andGuides on the inner side of life, would have all aspirants and disciples follow.The plans outlined by me during the past ten years are definitely a part of thehierarchical programme and are being presented in their specific forms by theother Masters. There is little that I can add. There is nothing which I tell youat this time that you do not already know. Do I need to ask you to workindividually and in the place where you are for national and world unity? Must Iplead with you to do what you can to heal divisions, and thus render effectivethat basic integrity which should unite the three major world powers throughwhich the Hierarchy is attempting to work? Do I need to enjoin the necessity tocounteract hate with justice, understanding and mercy? Have I to continueexplaining the need for the complete triumph of the Forces of Light, for thetriumphant progress of the armies of the United Nations, and for that triumph tobe won first of all on spiritual levels and then carried through—withcommonsense and persistence—on to the physical side of life, as well as in theintervening mental world? Do I need to ask for the control of emotions in thegeneral interest, and for the consecration of time, energy and money to theenormous task of human salvage?[443] On these points I shall not dwell. Nothing is here gained by reiterationexcept the growing burden of a responsibility which you can shoulder to youreternal happiness or discard to your shame and eventual karmic reaction. Onlythis will I say: Get rid of selfishness, provincialism and insularity. Think interms of the one humanity. Let your lives count in the scale of useful andneeded service. Leave off saying and thinking those things which are critical ofothers—other people and other allied nations. See the issues of this conflictclearly, and let no false and glamorous sentiment lead you to favour weaknesstowards the Axis Powers at this unique and critical moment. The form or forms oftheir tyranny must be broken and due payment made in all justice anddiscrimination to an outraged world. But the souls that implemented that tyrannymust—through sore trial and right spiritual direction—be again led to walk inthe light. The children of the Axis nations must not be penalised for thewickedness or the weakness of their fathers; they must be educated in new andbetter ways and loved into right understanding of their relationships.For two complete generations there must be a peace which will be unbrokenbecause behind it and protecting it will stand the Armies of the Lord. At theclose of that time, if the educational work done has been adequate, sane, wiseand sound, then these Armies can rest from their labours and the sword be turnedinto the ploughshare. If this programme of supervision, education and spiritualdirection is not thus enforced, the war that would then take place would wipeout humanity—as happened once before in human history.I would here refer you to a parable, spoken in terms of far-sighted vision andwarning by the Christ centuries ago, anent the man who cleaned house, castingout the devils; when it was all swept and garnished, it remained empty (assymbol of unused opportunity and ignored responsibility) and then, as the Lordof Light put it, “the last state of that man was worse than the first.” Thesweeping and cleansing has been going on for five long years, the final stagesof [444] this destroying but cleansing process are now being taken. Then, mybrothers, what?I have told you over the years what we seek to have you do: Rally to the aid ofthe New Group of World Servers, hard pressed in this day of battle. Spreadgoodwill—to humanity as a whole, learning steadily to think in terms of thatwhole; uphold those activities which benefit the whole and do not favour oneparticular nation, even if it is your own. Work today for victory and for theannihilation of evil. Work tomorrow for justice and for the restoration ofsecurity. When there is security, readjustment, the obliteration of theaggressor leaders, protection and restoration of the weak and the oppressed,plus right living conditions and wise education for the youth of the world, thenpeace will come but not till then. Let the soporific of beautiful peace talk dieout and let sane methods of establishing goodwill and right human relationsprecede the discussion of peace. The world talked itself into a dreamy state ofidealistic rhapsody about peace between the first phase of this world war andthe present one. This must not again occur and it is the task of the intelligenthumanitarian to prevent it.For the work to be done during the next twelve months (and then continued duringthe ensuing years), I make one last appeal. Stand with fixed intent,implementing the massed intent of the unthinking, the terrified and thedistressed and weak. Cooperate with the New Group of World Servers in everyland. Let the Full Moons of May and June constitute high points of spiritualattainment which can and will condition your daily life and service during theensuing year. Let nothing deter you. Nothing from any quarter causes the Christto deviate from His planned purpose; just in so far as His purposes coincidewith your soul purpose, move outward into a wider field of service. If you feelno response to world need and no call to serve, then beware and seek a deepermeasure of soul contact and spiritual relationship. Every word spoken or writtenat this time by an aspirant or a disciple is of a definite potency—either goodor bad.You know about the New Group of World Servers. The [445] work of the men andwomen of goodwill has been presented to you. The request for the forming oftriangles of light and of goodwill has been placed clearly before you. The needfor clear thinking is plain. The Hierarchy asks for your aid and your support inthe arena of world affairs. I have myself laid my plans before you. There theprogramme must be left to be carried out by you if you choose. For a quarter ofa century (since 1919) I have taught you. I ask now for your cooperation in ourmutual responsibility—the helping of humanity.May He Whom we all love and serve, the Master of all Masters and the undyingFriend of Mankind shed His light upon your way and evoke your trust, yourunderstanding and your help in His task—climaxing this year—of leading humanityinto the light of a new day.~THE CYCLE OF CONFERENCESMarch 1945The three months of March, April and May in this year mark a moment in time ofmajor significance in our planetary history. I refer to the Easter Full Moon,celebrated on March 28th, the Wesak Full Moon, which falls this year on April27th, and the Full Moon of June—Christ’s “Unique Occasion” as it has beencalled—which falls on May 26th. From the standpoint of both the Hierarchy andHumanity, the events during these few weeks of spiritual and mundane import(focussed through these three Festival Moons of Aries, Taurus and Gemini ) willbe of stupendous effect. What is done during this time by the Members of thespiritual Hierarchy of our planet (Who face a major test of Their hierarchicalpower , not a test of Their love), what is accomplished by the disciples workingin the world at this time, and also by the New Group of World Servers, can andwill determine the destiny of man for centuries to come. Even those who have noknowledge of occult matters or of human fate or of the effective enterprise ofhuman free will [446] (esoterically understood) stand today with bated breath,waiting to see what will happen and towards which goal or goals human thinkingand planning will be directed.The masses of mankind everywhere have only one desire—tranquillity. I use notthe word “peace,” because it has such a misleading connotation. Thinking men andwomen in every country stand with massed intent, determined, if possible, totake those steps which will ensure peace on Earth, through the expression ofgoodwill. Note that phrasing. The working disciples throughout the world arestruggling with every means at their disposal to spread the gospel of sacrifice,because only upon sacrifice can world stability be safely founded—the sacrificeof selfishness. In those words is summed up the demand being made on those whoseresponsibility it is to determine policies (national and international) and totake those steps which will establish right human relations. The Hierarchystands—no longer watching and waiting, but acting today with impelling wisdomand fixed decision in order to strengthen the hands of Their workers in everyfield of human activity (political, educational and religious) so that they maytake right action and correctly influence human thinking.A powerful first ray activity—the activity of will or purpose—is swinging intoaction. The Christ, as the Leader of the Forces of Light, has empowered theAshrams of the Masters upon this first Ray of Power to strengthen the hands ofall disciples in the field of government and of political arrangement in everynation; to enlighten, if possible, the various national legislatures by whatevermeans may be needed, so that the potency of their words, the wisdom of theirplanning, and the breadth of their thinking may prove so effective that the“Cycle of Conferences and of Councils,” now being initiated by the statesmen ofthe world, may be under the direct guidance (again if possible) of Those in theCouncil Chamber at Shamballa Who know what is the Will of God. The selfishnessof the little minds in the various legislatures of the world must in some way beoffset. That is the problem. I wonder if you can grasp the significance [447] ofthis happening? Down the ages, individual statesmen and rulers have from time totime been responsive to the influence of that spiritually supreme Council; butit has been the responsiveness of the individual disciple who has worked aloneand unaided and who has faced, (or experienced) defeat as often, if not oftener,than he has experienced victory. Today, in the planning now going forward inconnection with the various international conferences and councils of which youall know, the spiritual effort (for the first time in human history) is to bringall of them, as functioning groups, under the direct impact of the energy whichmotivates and actuates that place where the Will of God is known and thepurposes of divinity are defined and projected. This means that each of thecoming world conferences (and there will necessarily be many) will have agreater and far more extensive effect than would otherwise be the case; itmeans, however, that the risks involved and the clash of minds will also be fargreater. This is a point which you should bear in mind as you study and readreports of these various conferences.Forget not that divine energy must make its impact upon human minds; these mindsare the only available instrument—in their aggregated effect—through which theWill of God can express itself; they are necessarily responsive to thestimulating and energising results of that impact, and this will evoke resultssuited to the type of mind affected. Response will be compatible with thequality and the intention of those minds. Where goodwill is present, and wherethere is unselfish intention and a broad point of view, those qualities will bestrengthened and endowed with potency; where selfishness rules, whereisolationism and separativeness are present, and where there is the intention togain individual and national ends instead of those international purposes whichwill profit all humanity, those qualities will equally gain in strength.Two momentous, but preliminary, conferences have already taken place, thusinaugurating this new cycle of group functioning. The League of Nations was anabortive effort—[448] well intentioned but relatively useless, as laterhappenings proved. One of these initial conferences was held at Yalta. There,three men, constituting a basic triangle, met with goodwill to all andendeavoured to lay the ground for coming world happenings.All true movements conditioning long cycles in world affairs have at theircentre a triangle through which energy can flow and certain definite purposescan be worked out. Little is understood, as yet, anent the nature of the task tobe done or the type of men who work in first ray groups and Ashrams, and inWhose hands the political destiny of man rests at any one time. The wholesubject of discipleship has been distorted by theological definitions, basedupon sweetness of character, which often works singularly for ineffectiveness.The long cycle of ecclesiastical rule has biased human thinking so that thenature of spiritual strength and effectiveness is interpreted in terms ofreligion and in the terminology of churchianity (I did not say, ofChristianity), or in the phraseology of a marked pacifism or a dominating,religious, temporal control. The long rule of the various churches is over. Thisshould be grasped. They have done their work—in the early stages very good work,in the middle stages a necessary consolidating work, and in the modern stage acrystallising and reactionary work. The rule of the churches is over, but notthe precepts of Christianity or the example of the Christ. He is, however,responsible for a newer and more effective presentation of the coming worldreligion, and for that the churches should prepare, if they have enoughillumination to recognise their need and His effort to meet that need.Today a balance must be reached, and this will take place through the medium ofan enlightened statesmanship and through a political activity which will bebased increasingly upon the good of the whole of humanity, and not uponbenefiting any one nation in particular. This balance will not be expressed inreligious terms and in so-called spiritual terminology. It will express itselfthrough group work, through conferences, through Leagues of Nations, [449]organised parties and legislation. All of this will be the result of anintensive activity of the Masters and of Their disciples upon the first Ray ofWill or Power. The quality of their work will be to express the will-to-good;they see the world in large terms. To the uninitiate, they may at times seemisolated in their actions and over-powerful in the decisions which they reachand which they then proclaim to the world—much to the irritation of thelittle-minded and of those who interpret freedom in terms of their individual,unenlightened point of view. They are, however, working under spiritualdirection as much as any religious leader and this will increasingly berecognised. History will justify their actions, because they will have given atrend to world affairs and to human thinking which will work out in a clearerperception of necessity. What they do will evoke discussion and ofttimesdisagreement, as have the decisions of the Yalta triangle of workers. But theyare so constituted that they do not resent this; they know that the discussionevoked and the criticisms raised will reveal the inherent smallness andseparative instincts of their opponents, and—at the same time—will evoke thebanding together of those who see behind the apparently high-handed initialactivity an effort to precipitate with clarity the issues with which humanity isfaced. Thus humanity can be brought to understanding. These are the things whichthe triangle at Yalta attempted to do. These they may not have consciouslyrecognised as the work asked of them on account of their discipleship, but theyautomatically worked this way because they correctly sensed human need. Theywere and are handicapped by the fact of their own humanity, which makes themliable to make mistakes, but they are far more handicapped by the facts of humanselfishness and national greed and by the general low level of humanattainment—viewing humanity as one whole.Having made the issues clear, as they see them, having evoked the enthusiasm ofthe men of goodwill in the world, and the violent criticism of those who thinkin terms of partisanship, nationalism, and prejudice, the experiment of [450]the conference in Mexico City was undertaken with success. It was realised thatthere was an ascertainable measure of hemispheric unity upon which statesmencould count, and thus a foundation could be created for the far more difficultinternational conference to be held in San Francisco at the time of the Wesak,the Full Moon of the Buddha. Not for nothing is this conference being heldduring the five days of the Wesak Full Moon. It will be a time of supremedifficulty, in which the Forces of Light will face what I call “the forces ofselfishness and separativeness.”Subjectively speaking, the conference will be under the direct influence of theHierarchy. The consequent stimulation of both the selfish and the unselfishaspects will evoke a tremendous emotional and mental potency. It is thereforeessential that all aspirants and disciples throw the weight of their spiritualdevelopment and the light of their souls on the side of the Forces which areattempting to plan for the good of humanity, and who regard the welfare of thewhole as of far greater importance than any national situation or demand.Forget not that the Forces of Evil are still powerful, particularly on thephysical plane, and that there are many channels through which they can work.Germany is defeated, but is still capable of a final effort of destructivenessand violence. Japan is well on the way to defeat, but is still powerful. Thehierarchy of evil on the inner side is being pushed back by the Forces of Light,but its grip on humanity has not relaxed. It is through ignorance that theseforces can still attain much power—the ignorance of humanity itself. Nations andpeople are still ignorant of the true nature of each other; the world is full ofdistrust and suspicion. Humanity as a whole knows little about Russia, forinstance. The true significance of Its ideology is misunderstood because of theinitial mistakes of those who engineered the revolution; the license of unrulymen in the early days gave onlooking humanity a wrong slant on what washappening. But those days are over. In the fires of suffering and throughdeepened understanding, this great [451] and composite nation will advancetowards a demonstration of brotherhood which may yet set an example to theentire world. China needs a full literacy; her citizens as a whole know nothingof other nations; on a higher turn of the spiral, that educational supremacywhich distinguished an oligarchy of learning in the days of China’s ancientglory will again distinguish the masses of her people. The great continent ofEurope and the British peoples are still unaware of the real significance of theWestern hemisphere and of the United States—with its exuberant youthfulness.They find it as irritating as their deeper maturity and wide experience provesirritating to Americans. Americans, both in the northern and in the southernhemispheres, are still basically ignorant of the history of the nations fromwhich they spring, because they have laid the emphasis upon their relativelybrief history and have been brought up on a biased and oft prejudiced picture ofEuropean culture and of British aims. This ignorance throughout the world playsright into the hands of the Forces of Evil and—beaten as they now are on thephysical plane—they will give more violent battle to world goodwill on theplanes of emotional decision, and on mental levels to those ideologies which areof benefit to the whole of humanity.Physical plane methods having resulted only in the complete devastation ofEurope and in casualties which (if civilian men, women and children areincluded) amount to untold millions, the forces of evil will now endeavour toutilise the character of humanity as a whole (at its present total point ofdevelopment) to hinder the Forces of Light, prevent the attainment of worldtranquillity and world understanding, and thus delay the day of their own finaldefeat. This defeat, when accomplished, must include the three worlds of humanevolution—mental, emotional and physical. For long these evil forces have usedpsychology in order to reach the ends they had in view, and have used it withamazing success; they are still using it, and can be depended upon to employ itsmethods to the uttermost. They use the press and the radio in order to distorthuman thinking; [452] they present half-truths, impute false motives, rake uppast grievances, foretell (with foreboding) imminent difficulties; they fosterancient prejudices and hatreds, and emphasise religious and nationaldifferences. In spite of much shouting, demanding and proposed organisation,there is no truly free press anywhere; particularly is it absent in the UnitedStates, where parties and publishers dictate newspaper policies. The main reasonwhy there is no really free press is based on two factors: first, the fact thathumanity is not yet free from its predetermined reasonings, its basic ignorancesof factual history, or of nations and their psychology; humanity is stillcontrolled by racial and national bias and by prejudice. Secondly, the fact thatall this is nurtured and kept alive by the forces of evil, working upon theinner side of human affairs and dealing mainly with the psychological anglebecause it is so exceedingly potent. This they will increasingly do as thisplanetary war draws to a close; they will seek to offset the work of theHierarchy, to hamper the activities of the New Group of World Servers and tocloud the issues involved to such a degree that the men of goodwill everywherewill be bewildered and will fail to see the clear outlines of the factualsituation or distinguish between what is true and what is false. Forget not, theforces of evil are exceedingly clever.It is necessary also to remind ourselves that, having won the war againstaggression and barbarity upon the physical plane (and it is won), humanity hasnow earned the right to carry that accomplishment through to psychological andactual mental victory, and to do this together and with the mustered aid ofenlightened men and women from every country—hence the inauguration of thisCycle of Conferences and Councils. This cycle will prove long or short,according to the release of the will-to-good from the spiritual world, inresponse to the massed intent of the men and women of goodwill everywhere.As the destroying aspect of the Will of God nears the accomplishing of divinepurpose, the will-to-good can emerge with clarity and dominate human affairs.Out of the immensity [453] of planetary evil, demonstrated through thedestructive war of the past few years (1914-1945), great and permanent good cancome; the spiritual Hierarchy stands ready to evoke the good latent behind thework of destruction which has been done, but this can be so only if the goodwillof humanity itself is employed with adequate invocative power. If this goodwillfinds expression, two things can occur: first, certain potencies and forces canbe released upon the earth which will aid men’s effort to attain right humanrelations, with its resultant effect—peace; secondly, the forces of evil will beso potently defeated that never again will they be able to wreak such universaldestruction upon earth.Years ago I said that the war which may follow this one would be waged in thefield of the world religions. Such a war will not work out, however, in asimilar period of extreme carnage and blood; it will be fought largely withmental weapons and in the world of thought; it will involve also the emotionalrealm, from the standpoint of idealistic fanaticism. This inherent fanaticism(found ever in reactionary groups) will fight against the appearance of thecoming world religion and the spread of esotericism. For this struggle certainof the well-organised churches, through their conservative elements (their mostpowerful elements), are already girding themselves. Those sensitive to the newspiritual impacts are still far from powerful; that which is new always facesthe supreme difficulty of superseding and overcoming that which is old andestablished. Fanaticism, entrenched theological positions, and materialisticselfishness are to be found actively organised in the churches in all continentsand of all denominations. They can be expected to fight for their establishedecclesiastical order, their material profit and their temporal rule, and alreadyare making the needed preparations.The coming struggle will emerge within the churches themselves; it will also beprecipitated by the enlightened elements who exist in fair numbers already, andare rapidly growing in strength through the impact of human necessity. [454] Thefight will then spread to thinking men and women everywhere who—in a protestingrevolt—have denied orthodox churchianity and theology. They are not irreligiousbut have, through pain and sorrow, learned (without ecclesiastical help) thatthe spiritual values are the only values which can salvage humanity, that theHierarchy stands, and that Christ—as the symbol of peace and the Leader of theForces of Light—is not a negligible force but one that is evoking response fromthe hearts of men everywhere. True religion will come to be interpreted in termsof the will-to-good and its practical expression, goodwill. The coming worldconferences and the international councils will give indication of the strengthof this new spiritual response (on the part of humanity) to the overshadowingspiritual Potencies awaiting the invocative cry of mankind. When that cryarises, these divine energies will precipitate themselves into the realm ofhuman thinking and planning. Men will then find themselves gifted with renewedstrength and with the needed insight which will enable them to drive out theentrenched materialistic forces and the power of selfish interests—bandedtogether to prevent human freedom. If the conferences to be held in the nearfuture demonstrate that mankind is truly striving to bring about right humanrelations, the forces of evil can then be driven back; the Forces of Light willthen take control.The problem facing the Hierarchy is how to further these desirable ends withoutinfringing on human freedom of thought and action. It is with this problem thatthe great Council of the spiritual realm, of the Kingdom of God, is dealing atthis time, and it will provide the subject of Their discussions and finaldecision until the middle of June. When the sun begins to move southward again,Their decisions will have been made on the basis of human demand. Humanity willby then have indicated the strength and nature of its goodwill; it will havesounded the “word of invocation”—reaching up into the spiritual realm like abreathing forth of the very soul of humanity; it will have expressed a measureof its willingness to sacrifice in order [455] to stabilise human living, and torid the world of separativeness and of the abuses which culminated in this war;it will at least have set the stage for the blue-printing and planning which theCycle of Conferences and Councils will undertake. On the side of the Hierarchyand in response to human demand (in degree and in kind, according to the qualityof the demand), the Hierarchy will play its part and aid in making possible thatwhich men dream, vision, and for which they plan today.Let us consider for a minute what the Hierarchy stands ready to do and what itsMembers will plan and formulate during the Easter Festival this month, duringthe Wesak Festival in April, and during the Festival of the Christ at the end ofMay. It might be said that the Hierarchy, in conjunction with the great Councilof the Will of God at Shamballa, will divide Their work into three parts, eachgoverning three phases of the coming restoration of humanity to civilised andcultured living on a new and higher turn of the spiral. They will deal with theproblem of spiritual freedom, as it embodies itself in the Four Freedoms, andwith the problem of right human relations, as it will express itself throughinternational relations, national parties and general human affairs. It is notfor me to tell you what humanity, through its statesmen and leaders, will planto do at the coming conferences. It is my task to mobilise the New Group ofWorld Servers and the men and women of goodwill so that they may stand as agreat “army of implacable spiritual will” behind the participants in theseconferences and councils, enabling them to think with clarity about the issuesinvolved and thus (through this clear thinking) affect telepathically the mindsof men; this involves the use of a power seldom employed as yet on the side ofrighteous endeavour, though already widely used by the materialistic leaders ofthe forces of evil.It is the task of the Hierarchy to find and reach the enlightened men and womenin all the churches, all the political parties, all the organisations—social,economic, and educational—so that their united purpose will be clear. This [456]They will do through the medium of Their active, working disciples in the world.Thus They will pave the way for the true freedom of mankind—a freedom which isas yet a dream and a hope in even the most democratic countries.But behind all this activity, watched over by the spiritual Guides of the racebut determined and implemented by humanity itself, will be found the focussedattention of the Hierarchy. This spiritual tension which exists among Them isfar more potent than any of you suspect; it is part of Their preparatory work tomake available certain spiritual forces and powers which—though complementary orsupplementary to the self-initiated effort of mankind—will make that effortsuccessful. What humanity has now to do, and is already doing to a certaindegree, is to arrive at a right orientation as regards human affairs. Let ustherefore look at the three phases of this preparatory work now going on, andendeavour to gauge what will be the results if these energies and potencies arereleased through the invocative demand of men.The Forces of RestorationThere is first of all the phase, now in progress, which will culminate at thetime of the Easter Full Moon. This is dedicated to planning for an inflow of theForces of Restoration. Do not misunderstand these words. The Hierarchy is notoccupied with the restoration of the old order, with the state of life prior tothe war, or with the renewal of the theologies (religious, political and social)which have governed the past and which have been largely responsible for thewar. The restoration referred to is psychological in nature, but will work outin the restoration of the will-to-live and the will-to-good. It willconsequently be foundational, and will guarantee the new civilisation andculture. This is a very different matter.These Forces of Restoration are concerned with human vision, human integrity andhuman relations as they underlie the entire problem of the brotherhood of man.These [457] energies, if released upon the Earth, will render futile the effortsof the old order (in politics, religion and education) to restore what was andto bring back that which existed prior to the war. They will endeavour to offsettwo tendencies which will have to be taken into momentous consideration duringthe coming cycle of conferences:a. The tendency to crystallise, to cherish that which has gone (and goneforever, let us hope) and to over-estimate that which is old, worn-out and, if Imay use the word, stagnant.b. The tendency to over-fatigue and to complete collapse—once the war is over.This tendency is due to the weight of the war and to the physical andpsychological strain under which mankind has laboured for so many years.Great danger to the future of the race lies in these two tendencies; theHierarchy is determined to offset them as far as possible, whilst the forces ofevil are eagerly trying to foster and nurture them. They are also dangers whichthe intelligent leaders of the race equally recognise. This recognition willmake them slow in arriving at final decisions, because they will realise theneed for a cycle of restoration before final and lasting decisions are made.They will therefore work for a slower moving forward and for a more careful andeven prolonged investigation of the situation and of future possibilities thanmay seem desirable to the impatient.These new and living restorative forces are under the direction and the controlof One Whom we might call (speaking symbolically, yet factually) the Spirit ofResurrection. It is this living spiritual Entity, working temporarily under thedirection of the Christ, Who will restore livingness to men’s spiritual aims andlife to their planning; Who will engender anew the vitality needed to implementthe trends of the New Age and Who will guide humanity out of the dark cave ofdeath, isolation and selfishness into the light of the new day. It is thisresurrection life which will be poured into humanity at Easter time this year,to some [458] degree, but which—during the next three Easter periods—can bepoured in in full measure, if the men and women of goodwill will think clearly,speak forcefully, demand spiritually and implement the inner plans withintelligence.On a planetary scale, and not just in reference to mankind, this Spirit ofResurrection is the opponent and the antagonist of the Spirit of Death. Physicaldeath takes place only when the psychological and mental vitality of theindividual, of a nation, or of humanity drops below a certain level. Humanityhas been responding to the processes of dying during the last 150 years;psychologically, mankind has been ruled by selfishness, and selfishness is thepotent seed of death—material death, psychological death and mental death. Thisis seen well demonstrated in the German nation. Think this statement out, andthen recognise that similar seeds and similar areas of death (though to a lesserdegree) exist in every nation—even in the younger nations of the world. Hencethe war; hence the destruction of all the outer garments of civilisation.But the work of the Angel of Death, awful as it may seem as it demonstratestoday on a planetary scale—but beneficent as we know it to be in intent and inpurpose—will give place to that of the Spirit of Resurrection.It is the planning of this restoration and this resurrection activity which isnow under consideration by the Hierarchy, having been handed over to Thembecause They are closer to man than are Those Who function in the CouncilChamber at Shamballa. It must be remembered that this Spirit of Resurrection isa Member of that Council and Their chosen Emissary. He (if one may be permittedto personalise the impersonal) is in truth the “Sun of Righteousness” Who cannow arise “with healing in His wings”; Who can carry this life-giving energywhich counteracts death, this vision which gives incentive to life, and thishope which can restore all nations. At the Full Moon of March, let the demand goout for the appearance of this life-giving Spirit. Let it go forth with suchintensity that the Hierarchy will be called into active response and will [459]immediately release the potency of this Spirit into the hearts of meneverywhere.All of these spiritual forces, working as they are at this time under thedirection of the Leader of the Forces of Light, the Christ, are closely relatedand their activity is most intimately synchronised. In a deeply occult sense,they are all working together , because in the human family there are those whoare at every stage of responsiveness. This triple work of the Hierarchy,therefore, proceeds simultaneously—from the standpoint of time. The Forces ofRestoration are—on a small scale—evoking response from the members of the NewGroup of World Servers and from disciples everywhere. As their psychological“morale” stiffens and their will-to-live and their will-to-good is strengthened,an immediate effect will be felt on a larger scale; the work of the Spirit ofResurrection will intensify, and is already making its presence felt. More andmore people are beginning to be forward-looking and to hope with greaterconviction and courage for a better world set-up; their hitherto wishfulthinking and their emotional desire are slowly giving place to a more practicalattitude; their clear thinking and their fixed determination are far more activeand their plans better laid because both their thinking and their planning aretoday based on facts; they are also beginning to recognise those factors andconditions which must not be restored, and this is a point of major importance.At the stage which we are now passing through, these responsive people fall intothree categories:The visionary dreamer or the well-intentioned but impractical person whose ideasand world plans and suggestions as to the new world order litter the desks ofworld leaders and of those groups and organisations who are attemptingpractically to blueprint the future. Their dreams and ideas deal with projectsfor which the world of today is not ready and will not be ready for severalthousand years. It is an easy thing for them to present impossible Utopias whichhave not the faintest relation to things which are needed today and [460] whichcould be made possible. The name of these people is legion, and at this timethey constitute a definite hindrance. A vision of the impossible is not the typeof vision which will keep the people from perishing. Because of an inability tocompromise and to face up to things as they are, these people and those whomthey influence are landed in despair and disillusionment.The intelligent people of the world who are actuated by the spirit of goodwilland by the conviction that things must be changed. They are often staggered bythe magnitude of the task to be undertaken, and this frequently leads them totake one of three positions:a. They fall into the depths of pessimism. It is a pessimism based on a realability to sense the scope of the problem and to assess the resources available.This may land them in non-activity.b. They may leave the settling of the problem to the trained statesmen,diplomats and politicians, standing ready to help when—but only when—decisionhas been made. This leads to a shifting of responsibility. Yet, because the warinvolved the people of all lands and masses of population, so must thereconstruction of the world.c. They may assume responsibility, ventilate the abuses which must be put right,discuss proposed plans and, from their particular angle of vision, set to workto bring about, to the best of their ability, right human relations. Thisattitude of responsibility and consequent activity may lead to mistakes, but inthe aggregate of the endeavour it will meet the demand for right action in anemergency—this time a world emergency.Those partisan and nationally minded persons who will attempt to exploit theworld situation for their own immediate ends and for the benefiting of theirparticular nation or group. These people, and they are found in every nation,are selfishly motivated; they do not care for humanity as a whole and have noliking or interest in anything or anyone [461] but their political party and thereactionary interests of some national group. They see in the present worldsituation a grand opportunity to engineer moves which will benefit anindividual, a class or a nation. In doing this, they frequently have a widegrasp of affairs and are keen politicians, but all they know is to be used andso implemented that it attains their narrow ends, no matter at what cost to therest of the world. These people are usually a large majority. Their attitudeleads inevitably to trouble and hinders the work of restoration; it handicapsthose who are seeking to establish the entire human family in a sounder way oflife than heretofore, and to give a saner and wiser motivation to internationalrelationships. These are the people who are the most to be feared at the comingconference at San Francisco. The isolationists in all nations, particularly inthe United States, French national idealism, and the obsession of certainfactors in the Polish race over boundaries will need watching, as theseattitudes can be exploited by the evil and selfish interests which (behind thescenes) are seeking to prevent the world attaining that equilibrium which willpermit tranquillity. These three groups, however, indicate the successfuloperation of the Forces of Restoration. These are tentatively beginning theirwork and preparing the way for a much fuller expression of the intentions of theSpirit of Resurrection, after the coming Full Moon of March and in the threeyears which lie ahead.The Forces of EnlightenmentA realisation of the need of humanity, and a careful appraisal of that whichmust be done to meet that need, have awakened the men of goodwill toresponsiveness to the Forces of Restoration; this has led to an insistent demandthat the second phase of the hierarchial work be set in motion. This phase isdirected towards those activities and the development of that invocative spiritwhich will bring the Forces of Enlightenment into contact with humanity and leadto activity on their part. These forces can function [462] fully and until 1949hold sway over the minds of men, if the people of the world can be organised tostand with massed intent behind that type of statesmanship which is seeking thegreatest good of the greatest number, which sees the world as one greatinterdependent whole, and which refuses to be sidetracked by the clamouring ofthe selfish little minds or by the demands of the reactionary forces to be foundin all lands.These Forces of Enlightenment are always present on Earth on a small scale,influencing the minds of the New Group of World Servers, the selfless workersfor humanity, and the thinkers in every school of thought, working in everyfield of human betterment; they work upon and through all who truly love theirfellowmen. They are unable to influence the minds of the closed egocentricperson; they can do little with the separative isolationist; they areineffectual where the theologian of all groups—political, religious or social—isconcerned, and they can do little with the type of mind that is concentratedupon personal or group problems (their group, expressing their ideas and workingtheir way) and who fail to see themselves or the group in relation to the wholeof humanity.Today, however, a community of suffering and a general recognition that thecauses of war are to be found in selfishness and in inherent cruelty has greatlywidened people’s approach to reality and to possibility, as they exist today.Churchmen, statesmen and leaders of important world groups are admitting thefailure of their church, or their legislative bodies, or their policies to bringabout world order and world tranquillity. They are seeking earnestly for newways in government, new modes of suitable living, and for a method whereby righthuman relations can be established. They present a field of expression to theForces of Enlightenment and offer Them opportunity to change the ways of humanthinking; they are being mobilised by the light-bearing energies upon the planetso that wisdom, understanding and skill in action may distinguish the activitiesof men in the immediate future.[463] The organiser of these Forces at this time is the Buddha. He is the symbolof enlightenment or of illumination. Countless millions down the ages haverecognised Him as a Light-bearer from on high. His Four Noble Truths exposed thecauses of human trouble and pointed to the cure. His message can be paraphrasedin the following words: Cease to identify yourselves with material things; gaina proper sense of the spiritual values; cease regarding possessions and earthlyexistence as of major importance; follow the Noble Eight-fold Path which is thepath of right relations—right relations to God and to each other—and thus behappy. The steps on this Path are:Right Values Right Aspiration Right Speech Right Conduct Right Mode of LivingRight Effort Right Thinking Right Rapture or true HappinessHis ancient message is as new today as it was when He spoke His words on earth;a recognition of its truth and value is desperately needed, and the following ofthe “eight right ways of living” will enable humanity to find liberation. It ison the foundation of His teaching that the Christ raised the superstructure ofthe brotherhood of man to form an expression of the Love of God. Today, as itviews the crumbling, devastated world, mankind has a fresh opportunity to rejectselfish, materialistic motives and philosophy and to begin those processes whichwill—steadily and gradually—bring about its liberation. It will then be possiblefor men to tread the Lighted Way which leads back to the divine Source of lightand love.The Buddha could point to the goal and indicate the Way because He had achievedfull enlightenment; the Christ gave us an example of One Who has reached thesame goal; the Buddha left the world after reaching illumination; the Christreturned to us, proclaiming Himself as the Light of the World, and showed us howwe too could learn to tread the Lighted Way.[464] The Buddha, Whose Festival is held ever at the Full Moon of May (or ofTaurus , falling this year during the last week in April), acts today as theagent of that great Life in Whom we live and move and have our being, Who isHimself the true Light of the World and the planetary Enlightener. I refer tothe Ancient of Days (as He is called in the Old Testament ), to the God of Love,to Sanat Kumara, the Eternal Youth, the One Who holds all men in life and Who iscarrying His whole creation along the path of evolution to its consummation—aconsummation of which we have not as yet the faintest idea. Year after year,ever since the Buddha achieved His goal of illumination, an effort has been madeto increase the flow of enlightenment into the world and to throw the light ofwisdom, experience and understanding (as it is called) into the minds of men. Ateach Full Moon of May this has been the effort of the spiritual Forces which areworking out the Will of God. A supreme effort will be made by Them this year,during the five days of the Full Moon (April 25-30), and a major test of theeffectiveness of Their activity will be given at the San Francisco Conference.This I would ask you to remember, and for this I beg you to mobilise.A great Triangle of Force will be called into play during those five days as thenucleus through which the Forces of Enlightenment will work. The three Livescontrolling the energy which it is hoped can be released for the illumining ofmen’s minds are:1. The Lord of the World, the Light of Life Itself.2. The Buddha, the Lord of Wisdom, bringing spiritual light to the Hierarchy andrevealing what is the divine purpose.3. The Christ, the Lord of Love, presenting the demand of humanity and acting asthe distributing Agent for the Forces of Enlightenment.The Forces of Light, upon the physical plane, have driven the forces of evil andof darkness backward, and are bringing the war to an end through the defeat ofthe Axis Nations.[465] But another great “division” of those Forces (if I may symbolically use amilitary term) is being mobilised and can be brought into active service at theFull Moon of May (Taurus) if the demand is strong enough, is mentally powerfuland adequately focussed. These Forces work entirely upon the level of the mindand with the minds of men; it is their task to bring the battle between theForces of Light and the Forces of Darkness to an end—not only physically, butthrough the inauguration of an era of right thinking. This will end the presentcycle of emotional distress, of agony, of glamour and illusion, and ofmaterialistic desires which today form the pattern of men’s lives. This has tobe done by means of the spiritual will, working as enlightenment upon the mentalplane and demonstrating as wisdom, and as skill in action, motivated by lovingunderstanding. These three aspects of light—mental enlightenment, theillumination which wisdom confers, and loving understanding—all find theirperfect expression in the Lord of the World (Whom the orthodox call God) and inHis reflections, the Buddha and the Christ—the One Who brought Illumination tothe world and the Other Who demonstrated the actuality of the Love of God. Thesethree great expressions of divinity (One so divine that we can only know Himthrough His representatives) can be called into a new and most potent activitythrough right invocation at the time of the Full Moon of May. Those who cancarry out this great act of invocation are the spiritually minded peopleeverywhere, the enlightened statesmen, the religious leaders, and the men andwomen of goodwill, if they can stand with massed intent, particularly throughoutthe entire month of April. Their assistance can also be invoked by the dire needof men, women and children everywhere who can voice no cry, for they know notwhere to turn, but whose appeal is heard and noted.Their work, however, must be focussed through and implemented by the worldintelligentsia, by leading “lovers of humanity,” working in the variousorganisations and groups dedicated to human betterment, and by representative[466] unselfish people. It is they who must receive the inflow of “lightedwisdom” and of loving understanding; today this can be made possible in a mannernever known before. The success of the effort now being spiritually planned isdependent upon the ability of mankind to use the light they already have, inorder to establish right relations in their families, in their communities, intheir nation and in the world.This matter of being in a position to receive, and then be the agents of,enlightenment is an intensely practical matter. It is hoped that the responsewill be so real that it will constitute a great and uniform activity which willleave no single thinking person untouched, which will put the responsibility ofestablishing right human relations upon the shoulders of the men and women ofgoodwill, and not on the shoulders of the unthinking, undeveloped and sufferingmasses. This is a major point to bear in mind. If the thinking and executivepeople of the world can have their minds “illumined” by the spirit of wisdom andunderstanding, they can act as distributors of that light through enlightenedplanning and legislation, and thus affect the entire world. This is theimmediate opportunity ahead, and when I say “immediate” I refer to the comingfive days of the Wesak Festival. This should have a pronounced effect upon theSan Francisco Conference. I also refer to the next five years, with their fiveWesak Festivals on five May Full Moons.This year will mark a climaxing effort in the long relation of the Buddha tohumanity. Year by year, since He left the earth, He has come back to humanity,bringing light and blessing. Year by year, He has released this light and haspresented opportunity to the Forces of Enlightenment to strengthen Their holdupon the minds of men. The success of Their effort has been so great that it hasled to the crescendo of knowledge, to the glory of modern science and to thewidespread education which has distinguished the past five hundred years.Knowledge is the hallmark of our civilisation; it has often been knowledgemisapplied and [467] dedicated to the selfishness of men, but it has been animpersonal thing personally applied; this must end. Now another phase of thatlight can begin to demonstrate as the result of the past, and that is Wisdom .Wisdom is the enlightened application of knowledge, through love, to the affairsof men. It is understanding, pouring out everywhere as the result of experience.I call you, therefore, everyone, to a great service of demand and of invocationon behalf of humanity—a demand for the inflow of light upon the decisions ofmen. I would ask you to request and expect the needed enlightenment for thosewho have to make decision on behalf of men everywhere. Your individualenlightenment has nothing to do with this demand. It is a selfless motive whichis required and which must lie behind your individual and group demand. You aredemanding enlightenment and illumined perception for those who have to guide thedestiny of races, nations and world groups. On their shoulders lies theresponsibility to take wise action, based on world understanding, in theinterests of international cooperation, and in the establishment of right humanrelations.Throughout the month of April, until May first, the realisation of this is amajor duty. To the support of the Forces of Enlightenment I call all today. Asindividuals, you must work for an open and receptive mind, free from prejudiceor national bias; as individuals, you need to think in broader terms and of theone world and the one humanity. The mass of right-thinking and convinced demandwhich you, who seek to serve the Christ, can throw behind the men legislatingfor the world, can bring great results and can release the Forces ofEnlightenment in a new and potent manner.Concentration upon the work to be done is of such importance and will call forsuch practical activities that I will write no more at this time. I desire tokeep the immediate issue clear. We will deal later with the Forces ofReconstruction . I would like to close this message with some [468] words whichI wrote many years ago. They express the needed attitude and orientation:I ask you to drop your antagonisms and your antipathies, your hatreds and yourracial differences, and attempt to think in terms of the one family, the oneLife and the one humanity.~AN EASTER MESSAGEEaster Day 1945On this day, we recall to our minds the fact of Resurrection—a universal andeternally recurring resurrection. I would like to talk with you anent theChrist, about His work as head of the Hierarchy, and about the rebuilding whichhumanity must undertake and which the Hierarchy is seeking to impulse at thistime. A great period of reconstruction is planned. Here are the two words aroundwhich I wish to create my theme: Resurrection and Reconstruction . It will be areconstruction implemented by Those Who know the meaning of resurrection, and itwill involve a resurrection of humanity through the medium of its intelligentsiaand men and women of goodwill. These two groups (the Hierarchy and Humanity)will need to be brought into a closer rapport, and this is entirely possible ifthe followers of the Christ realise their opportunity and shoulder theirresponsibilities. I would point out that when I use the phrase “followers of theChrist” I refer to all those who love their fellowmen, irrespective of creed orreligion. Only upon this basic premise can a hopeful future be founded.I do not care whether or not those who read my words accept the occult teachingof a spiritual and planetary Hierarchy over which the Christ presides, orwhether they think in terms of Christ and His disciples. The essentialrecognition for which I plead is that this great group of spiritual Individuals,Who receive so general a recognition throughout the world and in all the greatreligions, should be [469] regarded as active . The Christian view of the Christis built upon that which He enacted for us two thousand years ago and throughwhich He symbolically indicated to us the way which all aspirants must go. Itportrays a picture of a waiting, quiescent Christ, living in some vague and faraway heaven, “resting on His laurels” and practically doing nothing very muchuntil such time as the sons of men of every race and creed acclaim Him asSaviour; this they must do both as individuals and as representing the organisedChristian Church. It is a picture of a listening, observing Christ, animated bypity and compassion, but Who has done all He could and now waits for us to doour part; it is also a picture of One Who waits to see what humanity, as awhole, will accept theologically. In the mind of the narrow, fundamentalisttheologian, Christ is seen as presiding over a peaceful place called Heaven,into which the elect are welcomed; He is also seen as consigning all who remainaware of their own spiritual integrity and responsibility, who refuse to begathered into organised churches or who go idly or wickedly through life, tosome vague place of eternal punishment. To this vast multitude (probably themajority) His love and compassion apparently do not reach, and His heart remainsuntouched. It appears that He cares not whether they suffer eternally or attaincomplete annihilation.This surely cannot be so. None of these pictures is accurate or adequate; theyare not true in any sense of the word. This is being realised by the moreintelligent of the world thinkers, and from the time of this Full Moon of June(Gemini, celebrated this year the last week of May) a different message must besent out by the churches of Christendom, if they are to meet the need of mankindand so aid in the work of reconstruction which lies ahead. They cannot stop thiswork, but the churches could be ignored if an inability to think with clarity isshown and if they are not freed from theological narrowness.Resurrection is the keynote of nature; death is not. Death is only theante-chamber of resurrection. Resurrection is the clue to the world of meaning,and is the fundamental [470] theme of all the world religions—past, present andthe future. Resurrection of the spirit in man, in all forms, in all kingdoms, isthe objective of the entire evolutionary process and this involves liberationfrom materialism and selfishness. In that resurrection, evolution and death areonly preparatory and familiar stages. The note and message sounded by the Christwhen last on Earth was resurrection, but so morbid has been mankind and soenveloped in glamour and illusion, that His death has been permitted to sidestepunderstanding; consequently, for centuries, the emphasis has been laid upondeath, and only on Easter Day or in the cemeteries is the resurrectionacclaimed. This must change. It is not helpful to a progressive understanding ofthe eternal verities to have this condition perpetuated. The Hierarchy is todaydedicated to bringing about this change and thus altering the approach ofmankind to the world of the unseen and to the spiritual realities.Before, however, They could do anything, our present civilisation had to die.During the coming century, the meaning of the resurrection will be unfolded andthe new age will reveal its true significance. The first step will be theemergence of humanity from the death of its civilisation, of its old ideas andmodes of living, the relinquishing of its materialistic goals and its damningselfishness, and its moving into the clear light of the resurrection life. I amnot here speaking in symbolical or mystical terms. I am dealing with facts—factsas real and as imminent as the coming Cycle of Conferences, and facts for whichthe past two hundred years have prepared humanity. This preparation hasculminated in the restlessness of the twentieth century and has led to thehorror of this world war, 1914-1945 through which we have been passing.The true work of The Cycle of Conferences about which I wrote earlier will onlybe inaugurated at San Francisco. There the stage will be set for those processeswhich will usher in an era of relative tranquillity; thus the door of the darkcave of materialism will be opened and the stone rolled from the door of thesepulchre which has too long [471] entombed mankind. Then will follow thosesteps which will lead to a new and better life and which will indicate theexpression of the spirit of resurrection. These facts (so near to manifestation)are physical facts; they will demonstrate as such if the disciples of the worldrecognise what it is that the Christ desires, and if the men and women ofgoodwill implement their response to His wishes.Speaking symbolically, the first step after the advent of the spirit of theresurrection will be similar to that in the Biblical story. Mary, that woman ofsorrow, of experience and of aspiration, stands (as ever in the symbolism of theworld) as the symbol of materialism. Humanity must say with her, “They havetaken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid Him.” But—she said it tothe Lord Himself, not recognising Him and realising only her own deep need anddespair. So must it be again. Humanity—materialistic, suffering, facing thefuture with despair and agony, but still aspiring—must go forth from the cave ofmatter, seeking the Christ and at first not recognising Him or the work that Heis attempting to do. The churches—materialistic, hide-bound and submerged intheir theological concepts, seeking political power or possessions, emphasisingstone buildings and cathedrals whilst neglecting “the Temple of God, not madewith hands, eternal in the heavens”—are occupied with the symbols and not withthe reality. Now they must learn to recognise that the Lord is not with them andthey too must go forth, as Mary did, and seek Him anew. If they will do so, theywill surely find Him and again become His messengers.The fact of the resurrection will be demonstrated during the next few centuries,and the Living Christ will walk among men and lead them onward towards the Mountof Ascension. The Pentecost will become truth. All men will come under the tideof inspiration from on high, and though they may speak with many tongues, theywill all understand each other.What I have to say to you, I intend to divide into two parts: [472]The Work of the Christ TodayThe Coming Work of ReconstructionThese two convey the same basic ideas and thus complement each other. Theyproclaim the fact that all that truly concerns us is that which takes place uponEarth in line with the “blueprints” which guide the work of the Christ. (When Iuse the phrase “concerns us” I refer to man’s physical, emotional and mentalreactions.) They proclaim the fact that every state of consciousness is anchoredwithin humanity and that all are factual here and now, did men but know it. Theyproclaim also the truth that Christ has never left us for a distant heaven ofnebulous outlines, but that He is ever within our reach. They proclaim also thefact that His interest, His arduous labours on our behalf and the activities ofHis working disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom and the Lords of Compassion,are with us, here and now. They proclaim that we are not alone, but that theForces of Light and of Enlightenment are constantly working; that the strengthand the wisdom of Those who know are being mobilised to aid mankind, and thatnothing can now arrest or prevent the contact between that intelligent aspiringcentre, called humanity, and the inner spiritual group, the Hierarchy.The Work of the Christ TodayForget not one important point. The Hierarchy itself is the result of humanactivity and aspiration; it has been created by humanity. Its members are humanbeings who have lived, suffered, achieved, failed, attained success, endureddeath and passed through the experience of resurrection. They are the same innature as are those who struggle today with the processes of disintegration butwho—nevertheless—have in them the seed of resurrection. All states ofconsciousness are known to Them and They have mastered all of them; They havemastered them as men, thus guaranteeing to humanity the same ultimateachievement. We are apt to look upon the members of the Hierarchy [473] asdifferent radically from humanity, forgetting that the Hierarchy is a communityof successful men, Who earlier submitted Themselves to the purificatory fires ofdaily living, working out their own salvation as men and women of affairs, asbusiness men, as husbands and wives, farmers and rulers and that they know life,therefore, in all its phases and gradation. They have surmounted the experiencesof life; Their great Master is the Christ; They have passed through theinitiations of the new birth, the baptism, the transfiguration, the finalcrucifixion and the resurrection. But they still are men and differ from theChrist only in the fact that He, the first of our humanity to attain divinity,the Eldest in a great family of brothers (as St. Paul expresses it), the Masterof the Masters and the Teacher of angels and of men was deemed so pure, so holyand so enlightened that He was permitted to embody for us the great cosmicprinciple of love; He thus revealed to us, for the first time, the nature of theheart of God.These perfected men, therefore, exist; They are more than men because the divinespirit in them registers all stages of consciousness and awareness—subhuman,human and superhuman. This inclusive development enables them to work with men,to contact humanity at need, and to know how to lead us forward to the phases ofresurrection.There is no need for me to enlarge at this point upon the world that They areattempting to aid and to salvage. The state of humanity today is known to alltruly thinking people. Devastation, crucifixion, slaughter and death arewidespread; sorrow, pain, disillusionment and pessimism are conditioning thethinking and the reactions of millions, whilst the plight of the unthinking buthelpless masses has reached an inconceivable height of misery. The ignorance,lack of understanding, and selfishness of men everywhere, particularly in thecountries which have escaped the ravages of war, aggravate the situation.Nevertheless with serenity and confidence, the Hierarchy today faces its arduoustask.One aspect of Their work and attitude I would like to touch upon, for it is aptto cause misunderstanding among [474] those with narrow vision and (if I maydescribe them) with constricted, though loving, hearts. I refer to the attitudetaken by the Hierarchy during the past years of war. This attitude has causedsome to find in it cause for criticism. Let me be explicit and also bring in thetime equation. I can well do so, because it was through my writings that theposition of the Hierarchy was affirmed and publicly stated.In 1932, I wrote a series of pamphlets which were intended to mobilise thedisciples of the world under the name of the New Group of World Servers and toarouse the men and women of goodwill in a final effort to awaken humanity to theneed for change. I endeavoured to institute a worldwide house cleaning and toincite men to take the steps which were needed to avert war—a war which theHierarchy saw coming closer, day by day. In a way unrealised and undreamt of bythe average man, the Forces of Evil were in a most potent manner emerging fromtheir ancient lair; they were intent upon seeking those whom they could mouldand obsess, and thus hurry mankind towards disaster. They found minds responsiveto their evil promptings in every country; they found also that it was possibleto take possession of two countries, Japan and Germany and—to a very much lessextent—of Italy.The Hierarchy, foreseeing this, attempted to offset their efforts. They madeappeal to the spiritually minded people of the world; Their appeal reachedmillions and culminated in May, 1936, in a planetary effort wherein the GreatInvocation was used upon a large scale in most of the countries of the world.For another three years Their labour of love continued; They struggled to savehumanity and to arouse men to their imminent peril; They endeavoured to arrestthe selfishness of humanity and to produce a new and fresh orientation to thespiritual values, and thus avert war. They failed. The men and women of goodwilland the spiritually minded people could not appreciate the true nature of theimpending danger. Some recognised it and did their utmost; a few worked hard,trusting to the wisdom [475] of those who knew and asked their aid; most of themwere disturbed and worried, but none of them appreciated properly the doubledanger with which humanity was faced: the danger arising out of humanselfishness and greed, plus the danger which was nearing the Earth through theagency of the combined forces of evil. These forces were organised by beings ofmost evil and expert experience and were preparing to obsess and ultimatelypossess the negative German people, ruled by a group of men of such positiveselfishness and aggressive materialistic spirit that they could easily becomethe agents of the subjective evil forces.In September, 1939, supreme wickedness broke loose upon earth. Because theHierarchy could not and would not infringe upon human free will, the evil whichhumanity itself had engendered manifested itself, and that to which certainnations and certain individuals had responded appeared, and thus World War IIstarted. Rampant evil took possession of the earth through the medium of theAxis nations. The Germans marched into Poland. This country was the recipient ofthe first impact because of her national selfishness, her suppression of thelower classes, her exaltation of a Fascist-minded aristocracy and her hatred ofthe Jews. The United Nations then began slowly to organise under the impressionof the Forces of Light. The war was on.What, under these circumstances was the Hierarchy to do? Full opportunity hadbeen given to humanity to arrest the descent of evil into manifestation. Voicesof leaders and humanitarians everywhere were proclaiming the need for reform. Onwhich side should the Hierarchy throw its weight and its influence? Should ittake sides at all, or should it be neutral? Should it remain aloof and take theposition of the onlooker, the observer? Should it stand superior to the deeds ofmankind and await the decision of the battle to be fought? Should it conform tothe sentimental ideas of the church-trained public and talk “Peace, peace” whenthere was no peace, and present a negative [476] aspect of love-to-all-peopleswhilst hatred strode rampant over the earth?It must be remembered that if this war had resembled other wars down thecenturies, and had simply been a fight between human groups and nations, theHierarchy would have remained outside the conflict and left mankind to fight aconclusive victory on the merits of its fighting units. But this time a greatdeal more was involved and this the Hierarchy knew. This war has not only beenan aggressive conflict between nations or of hate between the exponents ofdiffering ideologies but something far more serious. The Hierarchy knew thatextremely powerful forces were taking advantage of human stupidity to intrudeinto world affairs, and that potent groups of evil beings were organised toexploit the existing world situation. They knew also that the combination ofancient evil with men’s selfishness would inevitably prove too strong for eventhe United Nations, if they were left unassisted to meet the Axis Powers and theLords of Evil emerging from their hiding place. So the Hierarchy took its standupon the side of the United Nations and let it be known that it had done so. Indoing this, definite physical steps were taken to aid the Forces of Light; menand leaders were carefully chosen and picked disciples were placed in positionsof power and of authority. The leaders of the United Nations and of their armiesare not Godless men, as are the leaders of the Axis Powers; they are men ofrectitude and of spiritual and humanitarian purpose and are able thus towork—consciously or unconsciously—under the inspiration of the Hierarchy. Thishas been amply demonstrated. On account of this decision of the Hierarchy,Christ became automatically the Leader of these Forces.His work has been greatly hindered by the sweet sentimentality of the unthinkingChristian and by the well-meaning, but oft unintelligent, pacifist. Both thesegroups would sacrifice the future of humanity to temporary methods of “beingnice” or “being kind” or taking gentle measures. The forces of evil, stalkingthe world today, do not understand [477] such measures. The cry of such peoplethat “God loves all men” is true—eternally and forever true. It is one of theunalterable facts of existence itself. God loves—without distinction andirrespective of race or creed. To that Great Life naught matters but humanityand its perfecting, because upon humanity depends the salvation of all thekingdoms in nature. But this statement (made in time and space and as itconcerns the form aspect and not the spirit in man) is frequently misleading,and the simple-minded are apt to forget that the Christ said, “He that is notwith me is against me.”Men fail also to realise the potency of the thought wielded by Those who workunder and with the Christ. Thought is pure divine energy, impersonal and—likethe sun—it pours down upon the worthy and the unworthy, unless definitely anddeliberately directed. The Hierarchy was therefore faced with the problem andthe necessity of seeing that pure impersonal thought energy did not find its wayinto the ranks of those fighting human freedoms, for it stimulates the minds andthe mental processes of the good and the bad alike. This danger Theydeliberately offset by directing Their thought to the forces fighting under theleaders of the United Nations and by openly taking Their stand upon the side ofright human relations. They did not dare to do otherwise, for—in their place andgiven circumstances—the leaders of the forces of evil have proved themselvescleverer and more calculating than those fighting for human freedom. It is thisdistinction and its necessity that some kindly and well-intentioned but ignorantChristian thinkers often overlook.The work of Christ in relation to the war has also been handicapped by thecommercially minded in all nations, particularly in the neutral countries, whohave profited by the war, as well as by “big business” interests in many lands.These are focussed at this time through certain monied groups in every powerfulnation, particularly in the United States. He has been hindered also by thoseindividuals who [478] seek to exploit the plight of suffering humanity to theirown financial advantage.Therefore, when the war broke out and humanity chose to fight and the forces ofevil were let loose upon our planet, the Hierarchy ceased its efforts to bringpeace through goodwill and openly sided with those fighting to drive evil backwhence it came, and to defeat the Axis nations. Because of this decision onTheir part, unthinking people claim that the statements of those who representthe Hierarchy on earth have been contradictory and that the actions of theHierarchy have not been compatible with their preconceived ideas of how loveshould be demonstrated. For the past five years, therefore, the efforts of theChrist and of His followers, the Masters of the Wisdom, have been directedtowards clarifying the true issues in the minds of men, towards indicating thelines along which right action should be taken, and towards unifyinginter-allied policies. They have been occupied with banding together the men ofgoodwill throughout the world in preparation for the Cycle of Conferences andthe coming world readjustments. They have sought to protect the sufferers,organising methods of relief, guiding the minds of army leaders, and arousingpublic opinion to take those steps which will eventually lead to right humanrelations. Temporarily, the German people and the Japanese have been left totheir fate and to the tender mercies of the armies of evil; the present debaclein Germany is a testimony as to what evil can bring upon those who follow it.With all these modes of strengthening the Forces of Light and of extricatinghumanity from the descended evil, the Hierarchy has also been occupied withlines of activity which may not be disclosed, because they concern the handlingof the subjective forces of evil. The potency of these forces will be realisedif the length of time which the war has lasted is considered and also the factthat two nations have been able to withstand—until the past few months—an entireworld of nations united against them.This is a phenomenal fact in itself and a witness to the [479] strength of theevil group—objective and subjective—which has sought to gain dominance overmankind. Had the Hierarchy not taken sides with the United Nations and thrownthe power of its thought into the battle, victory might still be a long way off.Today it is well-nigh in our hands.As I said elsewhere, it is a fallacy to believe, as some do, that the main trendof Christ’s work is through the medium of the churches or the world religions.He necessarily works through them when conditions permit and there is a livingnucleus of true spirituality within them, or when their invocative appeal ispotent enough to reach Him. He uses all possible channels whereby theconsciousness of man may be enlarged and right orientation may be brought about.It is, however, truer to say that it is as World Teacher that He consistentlyworks, and that the churches are but one of the teaching avenues He employs. Allthat enlightens the minds of men, all propaganda that tends to bring about righthuman relations, all modes of acquiring real knowledge, all methods oftransmuting knowledge into wisdom and understanding, all that expands theconsciousness of humanity and of all subhuman states of awareness andsensitivity, all that dispels glamour and illusion and that disruptscrystallisation and disturbs all static conditions, come under the realisticactivities of the department within the Hierarchy which He supervises. He islimited by the quality and the calibre of the invocative appeal of humanity andthat, in its turn, is conditioned by the point in evolution attained.In the Middle Ages of history, and earlier, it was the churches and the schoolsof philosophy which provided the major avenues for His activity, but it is notso today; this is a point which the churches and organised religion would dowell to remember. There is now a shift of His emphasis and attention into twonew fields of endeavour: first, into the field of world-wide education, andsecondly, into the sphere of implementing intelligently those activities whichcome under the department of government in its three aspects of statesmanship,politics and legislature. The common people are today awakening to theimportance and [480] responsibility of government; it is therefore realised bythe Hierarchy that before the cycle of true democracy (as it essentially existsand will eventually demonstrate) can come into being, the education of themasses in cooperative statesmanship, in economic stabilisation through rightsharing, and in clean, political interplay is imperatively necessary. The longdivorce between religion and politics must be ended, and this can now come aboutbecause of the high level of the human mass intelligence and the fact thatscience has made all men so close that what happens in some remote area of theearth’s surface is a matter of general interest within a few minutes. Time andspace are now negated.The Coming Work of ReconstructionI have referred to the coming Full Moon of June as “Christ’s Unique Occasion.”(The Reappearance of the Christ, Chapter II.) Just what is entailed in thatstatement I am not empowered to say, but I can cast some light upon one phase ofit. It has long been a legend (and who shall say it is not a fact?) that at eachFull Moon of June, Christ repeats and preaches again to the assembled world (tothe hearts and minds of men) the last sermon of the Buddha, thus linking thefull enlightenment of the pre-Christian era and the wisdom of the Buddha to thecycle of the distribution of the energy of love, for which Christ isresponsible.This year the message of the past and of the present will be augmented, enhancedand supplemented by the enunciating of the new note, word or theme which willdistinguish the New Age and characterise the coming civilisation and culture. Itwill climax all the past and lay the seeds for the future. The significance ofthis statement lies in the fact that telepathically and with the entire force ofthe Hierarchy behind Him, plus the potency of Those to Whom is committed theexpression of the Will of God (later to be implemented by the Hierarchy underthe direction of the Christ), the World Teacher will, in His Own [481] right,make certain statements and use certain word-formulas which will create thenucleus of the thoughtform and present the blueprint around which and upon whichthe New Age will be developed. For this moment the thinking and the planning ofthe enlightened aspirants of the world have made—consciously, but mostlyunconsciously—long preparation. They have, through their efforts, provided themass of thought substance which the coming pronouncement will affect. Christwill bring this into proper form for the creative activity of the New Group ofWorld Servers working in every nation and in every religious, social, economicand political group.Christ’s pronouncement will be embodied in certain Stanzas, of which thosealready given are a small part. Only He can use these Words of Power in theirproper manner, connotation and emphasis; only an inadequate paraphrase ofcertain sentences found in that pronouncement can be given to humanity, and thisparaphrase can be used only when the war is over and not before. This means thatthey can be employed only when both Germany and Japan are under the completecontrol of the United Nations, through whom the Hierarchy has been working. Thiswill not imply the attainment of complete peace, but it will mean the end of allaggressive fighting and all organised resistance, leading to a period ofrelative tranquillity.Standing in His Own place at a central point in Asia, remote from the throngsand the impact of humanity, Christ will bless the world at the exact moment ofthe Full Moon of June. He will then repeat the Buddha’s last words or sermon, aswell as the Beatitudes which He uttered when on earth and which have been soinadequately and misleadingly translated—a translation based upon the memory ofwhat He said but not upon direct dictation. To these two messages, the Christwill add a new one, imbued with power for the future. That part of what He saysin which it is possible for men to participate will be used for years to come inthe place of the two Stanzas of the Great Invocation which have been used fornine years.[482] Behind the Christ, focussing with intensity today and preparing for agreat act of spiritual cooperation at the time of the June Full Moon, stands theHierarchy. Together with Him, They will invoke a group of spiritual Forces which(for lack of a better name) we will call the Forces of Reconstruction.I would ask you to have clearly in your minds the three groups of spiritualenergies which—at the time of the three Full Moons of April, May and June—willbe released into activity and which will aid humanity in its major task ofrebuilding the new and better world:The Forces of Restoration . These will work to restore morale and psychologicalhealth, thus implementing the resurrection of humanity from the death cyclethrough which it has been passing. The restoration of men’s mental condition toa wholesome and happier approach to life is the primary objective. These forceswill bring about the emergence of the new civilisation—which is definitely man’screative work.The Forces of Enlightenment. These, when let loose upon Earth, will produce aclear grasp of the Plan which the Hierarchy desires to see work out, arevelation of the issues involved in their right and possible sequence; and theywill also give a sense of proportion to human thinking, plus an appreciation ofthe spiritual values which should determine the objective policies. These Forceswill salvage the cultural gains of the past (a past which is dead and gone andof which little should again be restored) and will implement (upon the fewfoundational cultures of the past) that new and better culture which will bedistinctive of the New Age.The Forces of Reconstruction . These will usher in an era of pronounced creativeactivity and will bring about the rebuilding of the tangible world upon the newlines. This the total destruction of the old forms will necessitate. It is thisgreat group of Forces which will be set in motion by the Christ at the June FullMoon; the focus of Their [483] work will definitely be upon the physical plane.Their task is to precipitate and bring into manifestation that which the work ofthe Forces of Restoration and of Enlightenment have made subjectively possible.These Forces might be regarded as embodying and making declarative the “newmaterialism.” This is a statement warranting our closest consideration. It isessential that we bear in mind, as we face the activities of the future processof rebuilding, that matter and substance and their fusion into living forms areaspects of divinity; it has been the prostitution of matter to selfish ends andfor separative purposes which has been responsible for the misery, thesuffering, the failure and the evil which have characterised the career ofmankind down the ages and which precipitated this world war. Today humanity isbeing given a fresh opportunity to build again on sounder and more constructivelines that better civilisation which is the dream of those who love theirfellowmen, and to attain a new aptitude in handling substance. If men candemonstrate a gained wisdom in the creation of a form which will house thespirit of resurrection and express the enlightenment gained by the bitterexperience of the past, then humanity will rise again.The unique opportunity which confronts the Christ as His great hour draws nearis that of unifying, synthesising and integrating all these forces into onegreat and potent downpouring of spiritual energy. These energies involve theactivities of the Spirit of Resurrection, the inspiration of the Buddha as Hethis year conveys the strength of the One in Whom we live and move and have ourbeing, and that which the Christ Himself will set in motion in response to theinvocative appeal of the New Group of World Servers, the men of goodwill and the“massed intent” of the inarticulate masses. It is essential that we try to graspthe unity of this hierarchical effort.The energy which will lead to the restoration of human aspiration, rightidealism and fixed humanitarian intention [484] is that distributed by theForces of Restoration which were set in motion this year, at the time of theEaster Full Moon, under the direction of the Masters of the Wisdom and thesupervision of the Christ. They will concern themselves with the reorientationof the human psyche and with the inevitable consequences of thatreorientation—the acquiring of the vision which will bring about right humanrelations. This will be largely done by the spiritual people in the world, byaspirants, working disciples and (where possible) through the spiritually mindedpeople in the churches and humanitarian and esoteric groups.The energy which will lead to intelligent activity and to correct mentalplanning I have called that of the Forces of Enlightenment; once these have beenreleased, it becomes the responsibility of the New Group of World Servers todirect them. Then through the enlightened plans of the world intelligentsia andprominent humanitarians and racial servers, it will be possible to establishthose spiritual principles and that correct cooperative relationship whichshould distinguish human affairs in the future. Those who will be directlyaffected, if the plans go as desired, are the big educational systems, theworld-wide propaganda institutions, and all those agencies which work to educateand direct public thinking and mould public opinion.The energy which I have called the Forces of Reconstruction will be more generalin their application, and they will affect the masses of men through the work ofthe men and women of goodwill. I have therefore outlined a planned distributionof the three great streams of divine energy which will be set in motion at thethree current Full Moons—one already past and two to come:The energy of restoration, at the time of the April Full MoonThe energy of enlightenment, at the time of the Wesak or May Full MoonThe energy of reconstruction, at the time of the June Full Moon.[485] The inspiring sources of these spiritual agencies are, first of all, theSpirit of Resurrection (an extra-planetary Being), then the Lord of the World,working through the Buddha, and finally the Christ Himself. These Three willwork through the Hierarchy, the New Group of World Servers, and the men andwomen of goodwill. Such is the general plan proposed by Those Who stand—withenlightened spiritual purpose—ready at this time to lead humanity out ofdarkness into light, from the unreal to the real, and from death to immortality.That most ancient of prayers comes today to have its deepest spiritualsignificance. Let me repeat it in the order in which today it gains meaning:Lead us, O Lord, from death to Immortality;From darkness to Light;From the unreal to the Real.The beauty of this synthesis and the wonder of this opportunity are surelyapparent as we study what is here written and consider these aspects of thedivine Plan. Great Forces, under potent spiritual leadership, are standing readyto precipitate Themselves into this human world of chaos, confusion, aspirationand bewilderment. These groups of energies are ready to focus and distributethemselves, and the Hierarchy is closer to mankind than ever before; the NewGroup of World Servers are also “standing attentive to direction” in everycountry in the world, united in their idealism, in their humanitarianobjectives, in their sensitivity to spiritual impression, in their unitedsubjective purpose, in their love of their fellowmen, and in their dedication toselfless service; the men and women of goodwill are also to be found everywhere,ready to be guided into constructive activity, and to be the agents (graduallytrained and educated) for the establishment of what has never yet trulyexisted—right human relations.Thus, from the highest spiritual Being upon our planet, through the gradedspiritual groups of enlightened and perfected men who work upon the inner sideof life, on [486] into the outer world of daily living, where thinking, lovingmen and women serve, the tide of the new life sweeps. The Plan is ready forimmediate application and intelligent implementing; the workers are there, andthe power to work is adequate to the need. The three Full Moons which we havebeen considering are simply the three points in time through which the neededpower is to be released.Here, my brothers, is a picture of possibility. I seek to present it to youtoday because of world need; here is the ground for a sound, optimistic approachto the future; here is the assurance that the world can be rebuilt, thatconstructive action can be successfully taken, that enlightenment willincreasingly make its presence obvious, and that humanity will indeed rise outof its unhappy past into a new world of understanding, of tranquillity, ofcooperation and of renewed spiritual impulse.It will not be easy. The spiritual energies which will be released willinevitably evoke opposition. Selfishness and hate, with their secondary effectsof greed, cruelty and nationalism, are not dead nor will they die for a longtime to come. In the post-war world these conditions must be ignored and the NewGroup of World Servers and the men and women of goodwill must work together foran enlightened education, for a cooperative economic life, for right humanrelations in all departments of human experience, for clean political activity,for disinterested service, and for a world religion which will restore Christ toHis rightful place in the hearts of men, which will take the pomp, thematerialism and the politics out of the churches, and which will unify thespiritual intention of all the religions to be found in both hemispheres. Thisis a vast programme, but the number of enlightened men and women is also verygreat, and the power at their disposal ensures the ultimate triumph of theirspiritual idealism.The major need is to bring these people into a much closer relationship, to takethose steps which will enable them to realise that they are an integral part ofa group of directed and intelligent world servers, and yet to leave them [487]free to work in their own way, each in his own place and chosen field ofservice, and to see all these phases of the work as supplementary to all othersand as the working out of a divine Plan, originating in the Hierarchy ofspiritual Lives. Their work will be consciously carried out under the directguidance of Christ and His disciples.Long patience will be needed. Mistakes will be made. There will be periods ofindecision, of ineffective action and of negative yet deep discouragement.Workers will be prone to attitudes of despair, and at times the task will appearto them to demand too much, to be too difficult and the forces opposing whatthey seek to do too strong. But behind all the reconstruction with whichhumanity is faced is the potency of inevitable resurrection, the constant flowof enlightened thinking into and directing the mass consciousness, plus agrowing realisation that humanity is not alone, that the spiritual values arethe only real values, and that the Hierarchy stands, immovable in its spiritualstrength, steadily oriented towards world salvation, and acting ever under thedirection of that great divine yet human Leader, the Christ. The Christ haspassed through all human experiences, and has never left us; with His disciples,the Masters of the Wisdom, He is drawing closer to humanity decade after decade;when He said at the Ascension Initiation, “Lo, I am with you always even untilthe end of the age,” He meant no vague or general idea of helping humanity fromsome distant locality called “the Throne of God in Heaven.” He meant just whatHe said—that He was staying with us. The fact of His Presence upon earth inphysical form is known today by many hundreds of thousands, and will eventuallybe realised by as many millions.Therefore, my brothers, believe in the reality of the work to be done by thesegreat spiritual Potencies, invoked during the three Full Moons of April, May andJune. Go forth to the task of helping humanity, of establishing goodwill, ofbringing about right human relations and of restoring a true spiritualperspective, with undaunted courage, [488] sure faith and the firm convictionthat mankind is not alone.May the blessing of the Christ and of the Hierarchy rest upon all true serversand may they stand tranquil in the midst of strife.~THE GREAT INVOCATIONStanza ThreeApril 17, 1945As this world catastrophe draws to its inevitable close and the Forces of Lighttriumph over the forces of evil, the time of restoration opens up. For each ofyou this indicates a renewed time of service and of activity. I send youherewith the final Stanza of the Great Invocation, as I promised. (Reprintedfrom “Discipleship in the New Age”, Vol.II, pp. 148-151, to preserve thehistorical sequence of the issuing of the three Stanzas of The GreatInvocation.) I gave you the first about nine years ago and the second during thecourse of the war. I would ask you to use it daily and as many times a day asyou can remember to do so; you will thus create a seed thought or a clear-cutthoughtform which will make the launching of this Invocation among the masses ofmen a successful venture when the right time comes. That time is not yet.This Great Invocation can be expressed in the following words:From the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.[489] It has been difficult to translate into understandable and adequatephrases, the very ancient word-forms which the Christ will employ. Theseword-forms are only seven in number, and they will constitute His complete, newutterance. I have only been able to give their general significance. Nothingelse was possible, but even in this longer form, they will be potent in theirinvocative appeal, if said with mental intensity and ardent purpose. The pointsof emphasis upon which I would ask you to dwell (once it is permissible to usethe phrases) are two in number:1. May Christ return to earth. This return must not be understood in its usualconnotation and its well-known mystical, Christian sense. Christ has never leftthe earth. What is referred to is the externalisation of the Hierarchy and itsexoteric appearance on earth. The Hierarchy will eventually, under its Head, theChrist, function openly and visibly on earth. This will happen when the purposeof the divine will and the plan which will implement it is better understood andthe period of adjustment, of world enlightenment and of reconstruction has madereal headway. This period begins at the San Francisco Conference (hence itsmajor importance) and will move very slowly at first. It will take time but theHierarchy thinks not in terms of years and of brief cycles (though long tohumanity), but in terms of events and the expansion of consciousness.2. May it seal the door where evil dwells. The sealing up of the evil forces,released during this war, will take place within the immediate future. It willbe soon. The evil referred to has nothing to do with the evil inclinations, theselfish instincts and the separativeness found in the hearts and minds of humanbeings. These they must overcome and eliminate for themselves. But the reductionto impotency of the loosed forces of evil which took advantage of the worldsituation, which obsessed the German people and directed the Japanese people,and which worked through barbarity, murder, sadism, lying propaganda and whichprostituted science to achieve their ends, requires the imposition [490] of apower beyond the human. This must be invoked and the invocation will meet withspeedy response. These evil potencies will be occultly “sealed” within their ownplace; what this exactly means has naught to do with humanity. Men today mustlearn the lessons of the past, profit from the discipline of the war anddeal—each in his own life and community—with the weaknesses and errors to whichhe may find himself prone.I would here recall to you what I said last year anent this final Stanza of theInvocation.I am preparing to present to you for wide distribution throughout the world, thelast stanza of the Great Invocation. It is by no means easy to translate thewords of this stanza in terms which will make it of general appeal and notsimply of importance to convinced esotericists.... It can be so presented thatthe masses everywhere, the general public will be prompted to take it up andwill use it widely; they will do this on a relatively larger scale than theintuitional, the spiritually minded or even the men of goodwill. A far widerpublic will comprehend it. I will give A.A.B. this stanza at the earliestpossible moment; this will be conditioned by world affairs and by myunderstanding of a certain esoteric appropriateness in the setting of a timecycle. If plans mature as desired by the Hierarchy, the new stanza can receivedistribution at the time of the Full Moon of June 1945, as far as the Occidentis concerned, and considerably later for the Orient. Prior to these set pointsin time, the stanza can be used by all esoteric school members, after being usedfor one clear month by my group, dating that month from the time that the mostdistant members of the group receive it.I seek to have this Invocation go forth on the power generated by my Ashram andby all of you affiliated with my Ashram; the Ashrams of the Master K.H. and theMaster M. are likewise deeply committed to participation in this work.[491] I would ask you also to read and re-read the two Instructions which youare at this time receiving—one dealing with the Cycle of Conferences and otherwith The Work of the Christ. (The Reappearance of the Christ, Chapter IV.)Master their contents and let the blueprint of the hierarchical plan take shapein your minds. Then you can do your share in implementing it and will be able torecognise those who in other groups and in different lands are also a vital partof hierarchical effort.~THE RELEASE OF ATOMIC ENERGYAugust 9, 1945I would like at this time to touch upon the greatest spiritual event which hastaken place since the fourth kingdom of nature, the human kingdom, appeared. Irefer to the release of atomic energy, as related in the newspapers this week,August 6, 1945, in connection with the bombing of Japan.Some years ago I told you that the new era would be ushered in by the scientistsof the world and that the inauguration of the kingdom of God on Earth would beheralded by means of successful scientific investigation. By this first step inthe releasing of the energy of the atom this has been accomplished, and myprophecy has been justified during this momentous year of our Lord 1945. Let memake one or two statements anent this discovery, leaving you to make your ownapplication and deductions. Little as to the true nature of this happening is asyet known, and still less is understood. Certain ideas and suggested thoughtsmay be of real value here and enable you to see this stupendous event in betterperspective.1. It was the imminence of this “release” of energy which was one of the majorsubjective factors in the precipitation of this last phase of the war. Thisworld war started in 1914, but its last and most important phase began in 1939.[492] Up till then it was a world war. After that date, and because the forcesof evil took advantage of the state of war and belligerency existing on theplanet, the real war began, involving the entire three worlds of human evolutionand a consequent activity of the Hierarchy. Man’s attention is normally focussedon the externalities of living. Nevertheless, all great discoveries, such asthose made in connection with astronomy or in relation to the laws of nature orinvolving such a revelation as that of radio-activity or the epoch-making eventannounced this week concerning the first steps taken in the harnessing of cosmicenergy, are ever the result of inner pressure emanating from Forces and Livesfound in high Places. Such inner pressures themselves function under the laws ofthe Spirit and not just under what you call natural laws; they are the result ofthe impelling work of certain great Lives, working in connection with the thirdaspect of divinity, that of active intelligence, and are concerned with thesubstance or matter aspect of manifestation. Such activities are motivated fromShamballa. This activity is set in motion by these Lives, working on Their highplane, and it gradually causes a reaction in the various departments of theHierarchy, particularly those working under third, fifth and seventh rayMasters. Eventually, disciples upon the physical levels of activity become awareof the inner ferment, and this happens either consciously or unconsciously. Theybecome “impressed,” and the scientific work is then started and carried throughinto the stages of experimentation and final success.One point should here be remembered, and that is that this phase applies to boththe great White Lodge and the Black Lodge—the one dedicated to the beneficenttask of purifying and aiding all lives in the three worlds of material evolutionand to the release of the soul in form, and the other to the retardation of theevolutionary process and to the continuous crystallising of the material formswhich hide and veil the anima mundi . Both groups have been profoundlyinterested and implicated in this matter of the release of energy from the atomand the liberation of its [493] inner aspect, but their motives and objectiveswere widely different.2. The imminence of this release—inevitable and under direction—produced anenormous tension in hierarchical circles because (to express the ideacolloquially) a race was on between the Dark Forces and the Forces of Light toacquire possession of the techniques necessary to bring about this liberation ofneeded energy. Had the Dark Forces triumphed, and had the Axis Powers obtainedpossession of the needed scientific formulas, it would have led to a majorplanetary disaster. The released energy would have been used first of all tobring about the complete destruction of all opposing the forces of evil, andthen it would have been prostituted to the preservation of an increasinglymaterialistic and non-idealistic civilisation. Germany could not be trusted withthis power, for all her motives were compelling wrong.You might here fall back on the trite religious platitude that the innate goodin humanity and mankind’s inherent divinity would eventually have triumphed,because naught can finally overcome the universal trend to good. You are proneto forget that if the evil forces possess potencies which can destroy form inthe three worlds on such a wide scale that the souls of advanced aspirants anddisciples, and those of initiates seeking incarnation, cannot come into outerexpression during a particular world crisis, then you have direfully affectedthe time-schedule of the evolutionary process; you will have greatly delayed(perhaps for millennia of years) the manifestation of the kingdom of God. Thetime had come for that manifestation, and hence the powerful activity of thedark forces.This attempt to hinder the planned progress constituted a definite menace andindicated a supreme danger and problem. The evil forces were closer to successthan any of you have ever dreamed. They were so close to success in 1942 thatthere were four months when the members of the spiritual Hierarchy had madeevery possible arrangement to withdraw from human contact for an indefinite[494] and unforeseen period of time; the plans for a closer contact with theevolutionary process in the three worlds and the effort to blend and fuse thetwo divine centres, the Hierarchy and Humanity, into one working, collaboratingwhole seemed doomed to destruction. Their fusion would have meant the appearanceof the Kingdom of God on earth; the obstacles to this fusion, owing to theactive tension of the dark forces, seemed at that time insuperable; we believedthat man would go down to defeat, owing to his selfishness and his misuse of theprinciple of free will. We made all preparations to withdraw, and yet at thesame time we struggled to get humanity to choose rightly and to see the issuesclearly.The necessity to withdraw was averted. I may not say in what manner, beyondtelling you that the Lords of Liberation took certain unexpected steps. ThisThey were led to do owing to the invocative powers of humanity, used consciouslyby all those upon the side of the will-to-good and unconsciously by all men ofgoodwill. Owing to these steps, the efforts of those fighting in the realm ofscience for the establishing of true knowledge and right human relations wereaided. The trend of the power to know and to discover (a definite form ofenergy) was deflected away from the demanding evocative minds of those seekingto destroy the world of men, leading to a form of mental paralysis. Thoseseeking to emphasise the right values and to save humanity were simultaneouslystimulated to the point of success.In these very few words I have disposed of a stupendous world event, and in thisbrief paragraph I have summed up the working out of a specialised divineactivity.3. When the sun moved northward that year (1942), the great White Lodge knewthat the battle had been won. Their preparations were halted and the Mastersthen organised for renewed effort (through Their disciples) to bring about thoseconditions wherein that which was new and that which was in line with lovingdivine purpose could freely move forward. The war was not won by the surrenderof [495] Germany. That was only the outer result of inner happenings. The warwas won by the Forces of Light when the mental potency of the forces of evil wasovercome and the “energy of the future” was directed or impelled by Those Whowere seeking the higher human values and the spiritual good of mankind. Fourfactors lie behind the momentous happening of the release of this form of atomicenergy, through the medium of what is erroneously and unscientifically calledthe “splitting of the atom.” There are other factors, but you may find thefollowing four of real interest:a. There was a clearly directed inflow of extra-planetary energy released by theLords of Liberation, to Whom invocation had been successfully made; through theimpact of this energy upon the atomic substance being dealt with by theinvestigating scientists, changes were brought about which enabled them toachieve success. The experiments being carried forward were therefore bothsubjective and objective.b. A concerted effort was made by a number of disciples who were working infifth and seventh ray ashrams, and this enabled them to impress lesser disciplesin the scientific field and helped them to surmount the well-nigh insuperabledifficulties with which they were confronted.c. There was also a weakening of the tension which had hitherto successfullyheld the forces of evil together, and a growing inability of the evil group atthe head of the Axis Powers to surmount the incidental war fatigue. This broughtabout, first of all, a steady deterioration of their minds, and then of theirbrains and nervous systems. None of the men involved in the direction of theAxis effort in Europe is today normal psychologically; they are all sufferingfrom some form of physical deterioration, and this has been a real factor intheir defeat, though one that may be difficult for you to realise. It is not soin the case of the Japanese, whose psychological make-up is totally different,[496] as are their nervous systems, which are of fourth rootrace quality. Theywill be and are being defeated by physical war measures and by the destructionphysically of their war potential and the death of the form aspect. Thisdestruction . . . . and the consequent release of their imprisoned souls, is anecessary happening; it is the justification of the use of the atomic bomb uponthe Japanese population. The first use of this released energy has beendestructive, but I would remind you that it has been the destruction of formsand not the destruction of spiritual values and the death of the human spirit—aswas the goal of the Axis effort.Forget not that all success (both good and bad) is dependent upon the sustainingof the point of tension. This point of tension involves the dynamic focussing ofall mental, emotional and physical energies at a central point of plannedactivity. This, by the way, is the objective of all true meditation work. It isin this act of tension that the German people failed. This cost them the war;their tension broke because the group of evil forces who were impressing thenegative German people were unable to attain the point of tension which theHierarchy could reach when it was reinforced through the action of the Lords ofLiberation.d. Another factor was the constant, invocative demand and the prayers(articulate and inarticulate) of humanity itself. Men, impelled largely by fearand the innate mobilising of the human spirit against slavery, reached such apitch of demanding energy that a channel was created which greatly facilitatedthe work of the Hierarchy, under the direct influence of the Lords ofLiberation.4. The release of the energy of the atom is as yet in an extremely embryonicstage; humanity little knows the extent or the nature of the energies which havebeen tapped and released. There are many types of atoms, constituting [497] the“world substance”; each can release its own type of force; this is one of thesecrets which the new age will in time reveal, but a good and sound beginninghas been made. I would call your attention to the words, “the liberation ofenergy.” It is liberation which is the keynote of the new era, just as it hasever been the keynote of the spiritually oriented aspirant. This liberation hasstarted by the release of an aspect of matter and the freeing of some of thesoul forces within the atom. This has been, for matter itself, a great andpotent initiation, paralleling those initiations which liberate or release thesouls of men.In this process of planetary initiation humanity has carried its work as theworld saviour down into the world of substance, and has affected those primaryunits of life of which all forms are made.5. You will now understand the meaning of the words used by so many of you inthe second of the Great Invocations: The hour of service of the saving force hasnow arrived. This “saving force” is the energy which science has released intothe world for the destruction, first of all, of those who continue (if they do)to defy the Forces of Light working through the United Nations. Then—as timegoes on—this liberated energy will usher in the new civilisation, the new andbetter world and the finer, more spiritual conditions. The highest dreams ofthose who love their fellowmen can become practical possibilities through theright use of this liberated energy, if the real values are taught, emphasisedand applied to daily living. This “saving force” has now been made available byscience, and my earlier prophecy substantiated.(See “A Treatise on White Magic”, published in 1934, beginning on page 333,where the following statements appear:It might be noted that three great discoveries are imminent and during the nexttwo generations will revolutionise modern thought and life.One is already sensed and is the subject of experiment and investigation, thereleasing of the energy of the atom. This will completely change the economicand political situation in the world, for the latter is largely dependent uponthe former. Our mechanical civilisation will be simplified, and an era usheredin which will be free from the incubus of money (its possession and itsnon-possession), and the human family will recognise universally its status as abridging kingdom between the three lower kingdoms of nature and the fifth orspiritual kingdom. There will be time and freedom for a soul culture which willsupersede apart modern methods of education, and the significance of soul powersand the development of the superhuman consciousness will engross the attentionof educators and students everywhere.A second discovery will grow out of the present investigations as to light andcolour.The third development, which will be the last probably to take place, will bemore strictly in the realm of what the occultists called magic. It will grow outof the study of sound and the effect of sound, and will put into man's hands atremendous instrument in the world of creation.)[498] As I said above, the first use of this energy has been materialdestruction; this was inevitable and desirable; old forms (obstructing the good)have had to be destroyed; the wrecking and disappearance of that which is badand undesirable must ever precede the building of the good and desirable and thelonged-for emergence of that which is new and better.The constructive use of this energy and its harnessing for the betterment ofhumanity is its real purpose; this living energy of substance itself, hithertoshut up within the atom and imprisoned in these ultimate forms of life, can beturned wholly into that which is good and can bring about such a revolutionisingof the modes of human experience that (from one angle alone) it will necessitateand bring about an entirely new economic world structure.It lies in the hands of the United Nations to protect this released energy frommisuse and to see that its power is not prostituted to selfish ends and purelymaterial purposes. It is a “saving force” and has in it the potency ofrebuilding, of rehabilitation and of reconstruction. Its right use can abolishdestitution, bring civilised comfort (and not useless luxury) to all upon ourplanet; its expression in forms of right living, if motivated by right humanrelations, will produce beauty, warmth, colour, the abolition of the presentforms of disease, the withdrawal of mankind from all activities which involveliving or working underground, and will bring to an end all human slavery, allneed to work or fight for possessions and things, and will render possible astate of life which will leave man free to pursue the higher aims of the Spirit.The prostituting of life to the task of providing the bare necessities or to[499] making it possible for a few rich and privileged people to have too muchwhen others have too little, will come to an end; men everywhere can now bereleased into a state of life which will give them leisure and time to followspiritual objectives, to realise richer cultural life, and to attain a broadermental perspective.But, my brothers, men will fight to prevent this; the reactionary groups inevery country will neither recognise the need for, nor desire this new worldorder which the liberation of cosmic energy (even on this initial tiny scale)can make possible; the vested interests, the big cartels, trusts and monopoliesthat controlled the past few decades, preceding this world war, will mobilisetheir resources and fight to the death to prevent the extinction of theirsources of income; they will not permit, if they can help it, the passing of thecontrol of this illimitable power into the hands of the masses, to whom itrightly belongs. The selfish interests among the big stockholders, the bankingfirms and the wealthy organised churches will oppose all change, except in sofar as it will benefit them and bring more financial gain to their coffers.Signs of this opposition can already be seen in the utterances of certainpowerful men who are today encouraging a gloomy outlook in London and inWashington and elsewhere; the Vatican, that wealthy and reactionaryecclesiastical organisation, has already expressed its disfavour, because thatChurch knows—as do all the vested and monied interests—that their days arenumbered, provided humanity governs its decisions during the next fifty years bythe idea of the greatest good to the greatest number. World decisions musttherefore, in the future, be based upon a steady determination to further righthuman relations and to prevent selfish control, financial or ecclesiastical, byany group of men, anywhere, in any country. We believe the determination ofGreat Britain, the United States, and Canada, who are in possession of thesecrets, is along these lines.These few suggestions will give you much food for thought and real ground forhappy, confident, forward thinking. [500] Organise now for the goodwill work.The future of the world lies in the hands of the men of goodwill and in thosewho have unselfish purpose everywhere. This release of energy will eventuallymake money, as we know it, of no moment whatsoever; money has proved itself(owing to man’s limitations) a producer of evil and the sower of dissension anddiscontent in the world. This new released energy can prove itself a “savingforce” for all mankind, releasing from poverty, ugliness, degradation, slaveryand despair; it will destroy the great monopolies, take the curse out of labour,and open the door into that golden age for which all men wait. It will level allthe artificial layers of modern society and liberate men from the constantanxiety and gruelling toil which have been responsible for so much disease anddeath. When these new and better conditions are established, then men will befree to live and move in beauty and to seek the “Lighted Way.”"},{"pageContent":"SECTION FOUR — STAGES IN THE EXTERNALISATION OF THE HIERARCHYTHE SUBJECTIVE BASIS OF THE NEW WORLD RELIGIONDecember 1919Introductory Statements[502] Those thoughtforms which will materialise as the religion of the New Agealready exist on the mental plane and are in process of precipitation upon thephysical plane. Their lineaments can already be discerned. The wise Guides ofthe race, working under the Christ and having in view the need of the public fora form, seek at this time to hold just as much as may be of the old form andlineaments, as much, that is, as is consistent with evolution and progress. Inthe West, what the Great Ones seek to break is not the form of Christianity butthe grip of the Churches on the minds of the masses. The old forms of thoughtand of interpretation are now too restricted and too tightening in their holdupon the imprisoned and struggling life. That life must break forth. It cannotbe confined by the ancient restrictions. Yet at this time there does not existthe need for an utterly new venture or for an entirely new presentation oftruth. Nature and evolution move with gentle gradations and not with breaks anduncorrelated manifestations in the world of forms. In all the progressingdevelopments, the old outlines can be seen—enlarged, purified and morebeautiful, yet recognisable as the old form on a higher turn of the spiral. Itis not the freak cults, nor the widely divergent sects, nor the bands ofadvanced religious revolutionaries who can meet the crying need of the manyenquirers today. What is required is the re-vivification of the [503] old forms,and their infusion with fresh life; the old organisations must be awakened tothe hour of opportunity and must change from static organisations to livingorganisms. The old rituals must be revived and brought up to date (in theesoteric sense of the word) and the religious students of the world must begraduated into a higher school, given the occult interpretations, and taughtthat, after all, the truth has been present all the time, but hidden andmisinterpreted.It is surely easier to swing the masses into step and give them the newer lightof truth if that light is poured on to familiar ground. All must be given thechance to see and hear, and be offered the opportunity to weigh and judge thesignificance of reality. It is not just the two or three of supreme importance,or who have the nerve to take the needed forward steps, who must receive primeconsideration, but the truth must be stepped down and adapted in such a way thatthe advanced minds, the enquiring minds, and the reactionary masses may haveopportunity proffered them, to the measure of their receptivity. Did not thegreatest of all the Great Ones do this Himself in the synagogue and with Hisdisciples in Judean days?The aspirants and disciples of the world must realise that the hour has struck,and that the forces of the Christ are being marshalled for a supreme endeavour.These forces include both the human and the angel evolutions. It might be of useif I were to give you some idea of the scheme of preparation for the transitionperiod between the old age and the new as it is in process of completion in theCouncil Chamber of the Great Lord. Your acceptance and understanding of it andof its symbolic implications are dependent upon your capacity to assimilatetruth, to use your intuition, and thus to assist in the work itself when theright time comes.One event is already in process of manifesting. The Christ and His disciples,the Masters of Wisdom and the Great Companions, are approaching nearer to thephysical plane. The work of mental preparation for that event, and [504] theconstruction of the thoughtform of the advent or second Coming, has now beencompleted. There remains the precipitation of that event, its appearance onastral levels and its materialisation on the physical plane. I would ask all ofyou who read these words anent the second Coming, to reserve opinion as to theexact nature of that event. Keep the concept impersonal and link not thatappearance to a personality or to an individual. If you make the mistake ofattaching the meaning to an individual, you will limit your understanding andfail in right recognition of group purpose. The work of pouring out theprinciple of love (which is the Christ principle) and of lifting the masses intheir consciousness to the pitch where they can understand and welcome thatlove-principle is the main work of the new age, and it will inaugurate the ageof brotherhood and mould humanity into the likeness of the Christ. That theoriental peoples may call this great Official by another name than that of “TheChrist” has no bearing on reality and alters not the fact of His influence andHis esoteric coming.Certain of the Masters have the work under Their control, and through Theirgrouped disciples are already actively engaged in the work of preparation. TheMaster Morya, the Master K.H. and the Master Jesus are the three working at thistime in closest cooperation with the Christ. With them work the Master Hilarion,He Whom you call the Master D.K., and another Master Who is specially linkedwith the work of preparation in the sacred land of India. One of the EnglishMasters is also exceptionally active, and the Master in America is laying Hisplans toward an active participation in the work. These consecrated Workers forma nucleus around the Christ and direct much of the preparatory work. It is notpossible for me to tell you the lines of Their activity; I can but give youevidence which may later he demonstrated as true. These Masters are definitelypreparing Themselves for the task of outer activity and are intensifying Theirwork on the astral plane. To this fact can be traced the interest people are nowshowing in occultism and in the work of the Masters; more and more people [505]are becoming sensitive to and conscious of Their presence, and more and more arefinding their way into the groups of disciples.The Master Morya is at this time acting as the inspirer of the great nationalexecutives throughout the world. E’en those whose ideals coincide not with yoursare being welded into the world plan, and much of their immediate work isorganising the individual nations and welding them into an homogeneous whole,preparatory to their entrance into the great international thoughtform. All whowork with far vision and all who hold before any seething and bewildered nationan ideal for the whole are under His wide inspiration. Internationalism is theaim of His endeavour. With Him works the great Angel or Deva of the spiritualplane, referred to in the Treatise on Cosmic Fire as the Lord Agni; He seeks totouch with the hidden spiritual fire the head centres of all intuitivestatesmen. Three great groups of angels—the gold, the flame coloured and thewhite and gold—work on mental levels with those lesser angels or devas whovitalise thoughtforms and who keep alive the thoughts of the Guides of the racefor the benefit of humanity.The Master K.H., the Chohan on the teaching ray and He Who will be the nextworld teacher, is already active in His line of endeavour. He is attempting totransmute the thoughtform of religious dogma, to permeate the churches with theidea of the Coming, and bring to a sorrowing world the vision of the GreatHelper, the Christ. He works with the rose devas and with the blue devas onastral levels, with the wise help of the great guardian Angel of that plane,called (in Hindu terminology) the Lord Varuna. The activity of the astral planeis being much intensified and the angels of devotion, in whom the aspect ofdivine love is pre-eminent, work with the astral bodies of all those who areready to strengthen and redirect their spiritual aspiration and desire. They arethe angels who guard the sanctuaries of all the churches, cathedrals, templesand mosques of the world. They are now increasing the momentum of theirvibration for the raising of the consciousness of the attendant [506]congregations. The Master K.H. works also with the prelates of the greatCatholic Churches—Greek, Roman and Anglican—with the leaders of the Protestantcommunions, with the foremost workers in the field of education, and alsothrough, and with, the dominant demagogues and organisers of the people. Hisinterests lie with all those who, with unselfish intent, strive after the ideal,and who live for the helping of others.The Master Jesus works especially with the masses of the Christian people whoinhabit the occidental countries, and who gather in the churches. He isdistinctively a great leader, an organiser, and a wise general executive. Aspecial group of devas work under His command, and His connection with all truechurch leaders and executives is very close. He acts ceaselessly on the inneresoteric council of the churches, and with Him the groups of violet angelscooperate. In church matters He Himself carries out the behests of the Christ,saving Him much and working as His intermediary. This will seem logical to you,for His destiny is closely interwoven with the Christian Church and it marks theculmination of His work for the West. No one knows or understands so fully andwisely as He the problems of the Western culture, nor the needs of the peoplewho carry forward the destiny of Christianity.The Master Hilarion is actively occupied in the field of America, stimulatingthe intuitive perception of its people. He has under observation all those whoare true psychics, and who develop their powers for the good of the community.He controls and transmutes the great active movements which endeavour to stripthe veil from the world of the unseen. He impresses the minds of those whosevision will justify His effort. And He has much to do with various psychicalresearch movements throughout the world. With the aid of certain groups ofangels, He works to open up the world of departed souls to the seeker, and muchthat has of late convinced the materialistic world of life beyond has emanatedfrom Him.He Whom you call the Master D.K. works much with [507] those who heal with purealtruism; He occupies Himself with those who are active in the laboratories ofthe world, with great philanthropic world movements such as the Red Cross, andwith the rapidly developing welfare movements. His work also embraces teaching,and He does much at this time to train the various disciples of the world,taking the disciples of many of the Masters and so relieving Them temporarily,in this hour of crisis, from Their teaching responsibilities. Many of thehealing angels, such as those referred to in the Bible, cooperate with Him.The Master Who works in and for India labours with the minds of the politicians,educators and religious dreamers and idealists. He strengthens the efforts ofall those who work for the liberation of the submerged masses, provided theirmethods are constructive and not destructive, and that the gains desired are notfurthered at the expense of any part of the human family. He labours not toexalt one section of the populace at the expense of another, but works towardsbrotherhood and the right understanding of the requirements of all souls, bethey far advanced along the path, or just starting upon their planetarypilgrimage under the Law of Rebirth.One of the English Masters has in hand the definite guidance of the Anglo-Saxonpeoples towards a joint destiny. The future for the Anglo-Saxon is great and notyet has the highest flow of the tide of its civilisation been reached. Historyholds much glory for England and America when they work together for world good,not supplanting each other or interfering with each other’s empire but workingin the fullest unison for the preservation of the peace of the world and theright handling of world problems in the field of economics and of education.As the seventh Ray of Organisation and of ceremonial work is now coming intoprominence and manifestation, the work of the Master on that ray is that ofsynthesising, on the physical plane, all parts of the plan. The Master Rakoczitakes of the general plan as it is outlined in the inner Council Chamber andapproximates it to the possible. [508] He might be regarded as acting as theGeneral Manager for the carrying out of the plans of the executive council ofthe Christ.It might be of interest here to point out that when He comes Whom angels and menawait, and Whose work it is to inaugurate the new age and so complete the workHe began in Palestine two thousand years ago, He will bring with Him some of thegreat Angels, as well as certain of the Masters. The angels have ever beenactive in Biblical history, and will again enter into the lives of human beingswith more power than has lately been the case. The call has gone out for themagain to approach humanity, and with their heightened vibration and superiorknowledge unite their forces with those of the Christ and His disciples for thehelping of the race. They have, for instance, much to communicate anent colourand sound, and the effect of these two forces on the etheric bodies of men andanimals and flowers. When what they have to impart is apprehended by the race,physical ills and sickness will be offset. The group of violet angels or devaswho work on the four etheric levels will be especially active and they will workin the four main groups of men who are in incarnation at any given time. Fourrays dominate at any period, with one of the four more potent than the otherthree. You have this idea symbolised in the four castes in India and you willfind also that these four castes are found universally throughout the planet.These four groups of angels are a band of servers, pledged to the service of theChrist, and their work is to contact men and to teach them along certain lines.a. They will teach humanity to see etherically, and this they will do byheightening human vibration by interaction with their own.b. They will give instruction in the effect of colour in the healing of disease,and particularly the efficiency of violet light in lessening human ills and incuring those physical plane sicknesses which originate in the etheric body.[509]c. They will also demonstrate to the materialistic thinkers of the world thefact that the superconscious world exists and that angels and men who are out ofincarnation and possess no physical bodies can be contacted and known.d. They will train human beings in the knowledge of superhuman physics so thatweight shall be for them transmuted. Motion will become more rapid, speed willbe accompanied by noiselessness and smoothness, and hence fatigue will beeliminated. In the human control of etheric levels lies the overcoming offatigue and the power to transcend time. Until this prophecy is a fact andrecognised as such, the meaning of the above words will remain obscure.e. They will teach humanity how rightly to nourish the body and to draw from thesurrounding ethers the requisite food. Man will concentrate his attention uponthe etheric body and the work and health of the physical body will becomeincreasingly automatic.f. They will also teach human beings as individuals and as a race to expandtheir consciousness to include the superphysical. In the accomplishment of this,the separating web (the veil of the temple) which divides the physical planefrom the unseen world will be recognised as a fact in nature by the scientist.Its purpose will be acknowledged. Eventually it will be destroyed, by mandiscovering how to penetrate it. The date is imminent.Through the increasing sensitivity of men and through the steady thinning of theseparating veil, more and more during the coming years will the telepathicfaculties of men and their power to respond to inner inspiration be developedand demonstrated. By the growth of intuitional telepathy and the increasingcomprehension of the power of colour and sound will the work of the Christ andof the Great Ones be contacted and understood, and the peoples released from thethraldom of the past and enabled to enter into the liberty of the Kingdom ofGod. [510]Religious Organisations in the New AgeLet us now return to our consideration of the spread of the deepened religiousideals and the growth of the new religious organisms. In the process oftransmuting the old form and so releasing the imprisoned life, there are twothings which are steadily held in view by the Guides of our evolution:First, that the general public serves or is dominated by the concrete mind andis unable to grasp abstractions. It is the form which matters to them the most,for they are conservative and cling to the familiar. The church is intended toserve the masses and is not intended to be of use (except as a field of service)to the esotericists of the world, for they heed not the form to the same extent,having contacted somewhat the inner compelling life.Secondly, the church movement, like all else, is but a temporary expedient andserves but as a transient resting place for the evolving life. Eventually, therewill appear the Church Universal, and its definite outlines will appear towardsthe close of this century. In this connection, forget not the wise prophecy ofH.P.B. as touching events at the close of this century. This Church will benurtured into activity by the Christ and His disciples when the outpouring ofthe Christ principle, the true second Coming, has been accomplished. No date forthe advent do I set, but the time will not be long.The Christian church in its many branches can serve as a St. John the Baptist,as a voice crying in the wilderness, and as a nucleus through which worldillumination may be accomplished. I indicate the hope. I do not assert a fact.Its work is intended to be the holding of a broad platform. The church must showa wide tolerance, and teach no revolutionary doctrines or cling to anyreactionary ideas. The [511] church as a teaching factor should take the greatbasic doctrines and (shattering the old forms in which they are expressed andheld) show their true and inner spiritual significance. The prime work of thechurch is to teach , and teach ceaselessly, preserving the outer appearance inorder to reach the many who are accustomed to church usages. Teachers must betrained; Bible knowledge must be spread; the sacraments must be mysticallyinterpreted, and the power of the church to heal must be demonstrated.The three main channels through which the preparation for the new age is goingon might be regarded as the Church, the Masonic Fraternity and the educationalfield. All of them are as yet in relatively static condition, and all are as yetfailing to meet the need and to respond to the inner pressure. But in all ofthese three movements, disciples of the Great Ones are to be found and they aresteadily gathering momentum and will before long enter upon their designatedtask.The Masonic Movement when it can be divorced from politics and social ends andfrom its present paralysing condition of inertia, will meet the need of thosewho can, and should, wield power. It is the custodian of the law; it is the homeof the Mysteries and the seat of initiation. It holds in its symbolism theritual of Deity, and the way of salvation is pictorially preserved in its work.The methods of Deity are demonstrated in its Temples, and under the All-seeingEye the work can go forward. It is a far more occult organisation than can berealised, and is intended to be the training school for the coming advancedoccultists. In its ceremonials lies hid the wielding of the forces connectedwith the growth and life of the kingdoms of nature and the unfoldment of thedivine aspects in man. In the comprehension of its symbolism will come the powerto cooperate with the divine plan. It meets the need of those who work on thefirst Ray of Will or Power.The Church finds its mission in the helping of the devotee, in aiding the greatpublic which is innately religious and of good will. It hides in its heart thosewho vibrate to [512] the great love ray, the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. ChristHimself works through it and by its means seeks to contact the vast Christianpublic. It is the leaven in His hands to leaven the whole lump, and being in aform comprehended by the people, it can touch the great masses of seeking souls.By means of the educational work of the world, the Great Lord seeks to reachthose of the intelligent public who cannot be reached by means of ceremonial andsymbolism, as in Masonry, or by religious means and ritual, as in the Church. Ittouches the masses and those in whom the intelligence aspect predominates to thelessening of the other two aspects. It aids those men who are predominantly onthe third Ray of Intelligent Activity.In all these bodies there are to be found esoteric groups who are the custodiansof the inner teaching and whose uniformity in aspiration and in technique isone. These inner groups consist of occult students and of those who are indirect or occasional touch with the Masters and of those whose souls are insufficient control so that the will of the Hierarchy may be communicated andgradually filter down to the channel of the physical brain. These groups whichconstitute the true inner esoteric group are many, but their membership is yetsmall, for the fact that a student may belong to any of the outer esotericgroups so-called is no indication of his true esoteric status. When the few whoare the true esoteric students of the world know the difference between ethericand astral forms, between mental clairaudience and clairvoyance and their astralcounterparts, between the elementals of thought and the elementals of nature,then will the Christ and His church have a real esoteric group on the physicalplane and the outer organisations receive the needed stimulation. That is why itis necessary to work with the students at this time and train them in the natureof true occultism. When we understand better the significance of time inprevision, and of force in movement, and when we comprehend more fully the lawsthat control the subtler bodies, and through them therefore the laws thatfunction on the planes whereon those bodies express [513] themselves, then willthere be more intelligent and more useful work offered in cooperation with theOccult Hierarchy.In the esoteric group, which is composed of the true spiritual esotericistsfound in all exoteric occult groups, in the church, by whatever name it may becalled, and in Masonry you have the three paths leading to initiation. As yetthey are not used, and one of the things that will eventuate—when the newuniversal religion has sway and the nature of esotericism is understood—will bethe utilisation of the banded esoteric organisms, the Masonic organism and theChurch organism as initiating centres. These three groups converge as theirinner sanctuaries are approached. There is no dissociation between the OneUniversal Church, the sacred inner Lodge of all true Masons, and the innermostcircles of the esoteric societies. Three types of men have their need met, threemajor rays are expressed, and the three paths to the Master are trodden, leadingall three to the same portal and the same Hierophant.It must not be forgotten that only those souls who are on the Probationary Pathor the Path of Discipleship will form the nucleus of the coming world religion.It exists on the inner planes for the purpose of gathering out of all thechurches those who have reached the point in evolution where they canconsciously and of their own free will place their feet upon that PATH whichleads to the centre of peace; who can in full awareness turn their eyes upon theGreat Lord, and transmute the life of worldly endeavour into the life ofservice. The first detachment gathered into the coming Church will be found tobe a part of the present great band of servers. These have, down the ages, beenassociated with the Christ in His work. Remember always the fact of the work Hedid in connection with the last advent, and remember likewise that in theturning of the cyclic wheel, in the evolution of the spiral, similar conditionswill eventuate, the same needs arise, and the same egos incarnate that werepresent in the days of old in Palestine. The numbers of those associated withHim will be greatly increased, [514] for all who knew Him in earlierincarnations in the ancient East, all whom He cured or taught, all who contactedHim or in any way incurred karma with Him or with the Master Jesus, will havethe opportunity to cooperate at this time. Each sincere aspirant who is closelyconnected with the present Church organisations, who feels a close link with theChrist and who loves Him, can be practically sure that in Palestine they sawHim, knew Him and mayhap served and loved Him.The sacraments, properly understood, serve to strengthen this link andrealisation, and such a one as that of Baptism (when entered upon withunderstanding) will draw forth oft a response from the Great Lord Himself. It isalmost as if a golden strand were directed from His heart to the heart of theservant—a strand unbreakable and unfathomable and which, with eachadministration of any of the holy rites in the succession of lives, becomesstronger, broader and brighter. Eventually these many strands will becomereabsorbed into their source when the Body of the Christ—one of the sevenHeavenly Men on the second or monadic plane—is completed in full expression, foreach one linked to Him becomes, in a vital sense, a cell in His Body. This theinitiate Paul truly sensed and knew. Via this strand passes the power tostrengthen, to stimulate, to vivify and to bless, and this is the true apostolicsuccession. All true disciples are priests unto the Lord.There is no question therefore that the work to be done in familiarising thegeneral public with the nature of the Mysteries is of paramount importance atthis time. These Mysteries will be restored to outer expression through themedium of the Church and the Masonic Fraternity, if those groups leave off beingorganisations with material purpose, and become organisms with livingobjectives. When the Great One comes with His disciples and initiates we shallhave (after a period of intensive work on the physical plane beginning aroundthe year 1940) the restoration of the Mysteries and their exoteric presentation,as a consequence of the first initiation. Why can this be so? Because theChrist, [515] as you know, is the Hierophant of the first and second initiationsand He will, if the preparatory work is faithfully and well done, administer thefirst initiation in the inner sanctuaries of those two bodies. Many faithfulworkers will, during His period of work on earth, take this first initiation,and some few will take the second. The race has now reached a point where manysouls are on the Probationary Path and need but the heightening of theirvibration (made possible by His Presence) to reach the portal of the Pathitself.And now what is it that you all can do? What is the condition surrounding theaspirants of the world today? We have a world full of unrest, a world full ofpain, sorrow and strife, a world in which the emotional bodies of humanity arein a condition of tremendous disturbance, a world in which animals, men, womenand children suffer, agonise and die; a world in which hunger, sin, sickness,famine, rapine, and murder stalk unarrested; a world in which the forms ofreligion exist but the life has gone, in which science is prostituted to theends of money and hate, and in which the produce of the earth is not for thesustenance of the race but for the nourishing of the purses of the few; a worldin which faith is oft the subject of scoffing, in which unselfishness isregarded as the attribute of a fool, and in which love is exploited in itslowest expression, sex. Is this the atmosphere in which the Christ and Hisdisciples can breathe? Is this a condition in which They can find harmoniousinfluences? Is this a state of affairs in which They can work and live? Are thevibrations extant upon this planet similar to Theirs and to which They canrespond? We know that it is not so and that much must be done to facilitateTheir work. What then can we do?First, teach the law of evolution and its inevitable corollary, perfected men.Men must be taught that such Great Souls exist, and exist entirely to serveTheir fellowmen. The public must be familiarised with Their names andattributes, with Their work and purpose, and men must be told that They arecoming forth for the salvation of the world.[516] Secondly, disciples and aspirants must on every hand live harmoniously andlove . The violent vibrations of our surroundings must be stilled by a strongcounter vibration of love, remembering ever that as we work on the side ofevolution, the power of the Godhead itself is with us, available for use. Naughtcan withstand the steady pressures of love and harmony when they are appliedlong enough. It is not spasmodic efforts that count. It is the long-sustained,unvarying pressure which eventually breaks down opposition and the walls ofseparativeness.Thirdly, esoteric organisations must stand for all that tends to unity. Alltypes of work, all the exterior efforts of the many organisations must meet withloving cooperation and assistance. We stand in a world of endeavour as focalpoints for love. Our objective is the helping of the Great Ones and therendering to Them of that intelligent assistance which will make Their plans forhumanity materialise. Through us, They choose to work for the uplift of theworld, and through the esoteric groups there must be the putting forth of thatintensified spiritual effort which will stem the tide of evil and avert thepossible difficulties that lurk in the darkness of the present chaos. The livingorganism of aspirants and disciples can provide a centre of peace, power andlove, of practical help and spiritual uplift such as the world has not hithertoseen. Such is the hope. See you do it.Definite work must also be done in healing, in exorcising, in curing mental andastral diseases, and it must be demonstrated to the world that the ancient powerto heal still lies in the hands of those who consistently follow the Christ.Those who use this power only for the sake of the little ones, taking andseeking no personal reward, can manifest the ancient way to heal which has smallresemblance to the modern methods of the mental schools.Preparation too must be given to the developing of the higher psychic powers,and through the trained expression of those powers can proof be given to thescientists of the world of the latent forces in man which can be utilised bythose who wisely and sanely follow in the footsteps of the [517] Christ, thegreatest Psychic of all time. Hospitals and schools will appear under the directguidance of the Masters; Teachers Who can heal will come forth, and others willappear who will train the minds of the pupils to be responsive to directinspiration from above. The faculty of the intuition must be developedscientifically.Finally, Church members and members of the Masonic Fraternities must familiarisethemselves with the inner significance of the various rites, ceremonies, coloursand rituals, and with the work performed upon the floor of the temple. They mustknow why such and such things are done in due order and the reason for thevarious precedences, the words, gestures and acts.Should there be a real and true response to these practical suggestions, it maybe possible for the work to go forward more rapidly than at present seemspossible. Much trouble and stress may be averted if the aspirants of the worldmeasure up to their proffered opportunity and make due sacrifice and effort.Much preliminary work has to be done. There must be much heavy work, ploughingthe soil and weeding out that which is undesirable.This may take seven years. The work to be done in that period will be silenteducational work, and the diligent propaganda that the Church and analogousorganisations can do. Classes must be held by the occultists of the world inwhich the teaching is stepped down to meet the need of the little ones; thebroad platform upon which the Church should stand should be proclaimed, andinstruction should be given in the meaning of its ceremonies and teachings. Thenwill follow seven years of germination of the seed sown, a period of growth anddeveloping influences. This brings us to the period of thirteen years from nowfor the cycle of fourteen began the year before I proffered you thesesuggestions. Should the work progress as desired, it may mark the time of thenear appearing of the Great Lord and the close sound of His feet.These Servers who watch on the inner side, the disciples and initiates engagedin this work, watch with loving care all [518] who struggle in the thick of thefray. They are like the Headquarters Staff who follow the battle from a secureeminence. In Their security lies your ultimate success, for They hold in Theirhands the solution of many problems, and apply the solution when the battle goescontrary. One thing always I appeal to you to remember, for it is of vitalimportance. It is the fact that in the destruction of the form lies hid thesecret of all evolutionary growth. This is not a truism. You can see it inconstant expression. The Masters utilise the form (a form of Churchorganisation, a Masonic Fraternity, an esoteric group) as much as may be. Theyseek to work through it, imprisoning the life within the containing walls forjust as long as the purpose is served and the race is instructed through thatform. Then comes the time when the form may no longer serve the intent, when thestructure atrophies, crystallises, and becomes vulnerable and easily destroyed.So it goes, and a new form takes its place. Watch and see if this is not everso. In the infancy of the race the forms for long endured. Evolution moved moreslowly. But now on this upward trend the form has but short duration. It livesvitally for but a brief period; with rapidity it moves through its cycle; withrapidity it disintegrates and is succeeded by another. This rapidity willincrease and not decrease as the consciousness, or inner expanding realised lifeof the race, vibrates to a more rapid rate of rhythm.This will be tremendously increased during the vital and unusual cycle uponwhich we entered in 1918, which will be tremendously speeded up in 1925, andwill climax in a peculiar sense in 1934. We shall then enter upon three years ofexcessive endeavour in an effort to hasten the Coming and to prepare mankind forthe great day of opportunity. You who know of these times and can interpret themaright in the light of the illumined intuition, must unite together for therendering of Service and for the helping of the Brotherhood, of which the Christis the divine Leader, and of which the Masters, the initiates, disciples andaspirants are the working and living organism on the physical plane. [519]~THE EXTERNALISATION OF THE ASHRAMSJanuary 1946In these words I refer to an aspect of the amazing enterprise upon which theHierarchy is embarked within this cycle: Its appearance, expression and activityupon the physical plane for the first time since it withdrew into the subjectiveside of life and focussed itself on the mental plane (instead of the physical)during the days of ancient Atlantis and after the war between the Lords of theShining Countenance and Lords of the Dark Face, as The Secret Doctrine calls it.For millions of years, as a result of the triumph of evil in those days, theHierarchy has stood in silence behind world events, occupied with the followingwork—a work which will eventually be carried on exoterically instead ofesoterically:1. The Hierarchy stands as a wall between humanity and excessive evil. Forgetnot that as humanity is thus protected that protection extends to all thesubhuman kingdoms, of which the fourth kingdom, the human, is the Macrocosm. Theexcessive evil, emanating from cosmic sources, requires the trained skill of theHierarchy and the fiat of Shamballa to prevent it flooding over disastrously.2. The Hierarchy works constantly at the task of awakening the consciousnessaspect in all forms, so that it is awakened, expanded and intelligentlyemployed.3. The Hierarchy directs world events, as far as mankind will permit (for thefree will and free decision of mankind may not be ignored), so that theunfolding consciousness may express itself through developing and adequatesocial, political, religious and economic world forms. They give direction; Theythrow a light; They impress those who are in contact with Them, and through theinflow of ideas and through revelation They definitely influence the tide ofhuman affairs.4. The Hierarchy directs and controls, more than is realised, the unfoldingcyclic cultures and their resultant civilisations. These can then provideadequate forms, temporarily [520] useful for the emerging soul of humanity. Theformat of cultures and civilisations receives special attention.5. The Hierarchy receives and transmits energies and consequent forces fromShamballa, with resultant effects within the Hierarchy itself, and also witheffects upon humanity and upon the soul of all things to be found in allkingdoms.6. The Hierarchy receives that esoteric “Fire of God” which brings to an endcycles, ideologies, organisations and civilisations when the due and right timecomes. This They do in order to make place for that which is better and whichwill prove adequate and not limiting to the awakening consciousness and theemerging life.7. The Hierarchy prepares men for initiation by:a. Receiving them into the Ashrams of the Masters.b. Offering Their disciples opportunity to serve in relation to the emergingPlan.c. Inaugurating through the means of the disciples of the period those newpresentations of the training needed for initiation. Each major cycle receivesnew forms of the same ancient, yet basic, teaching. This present one is such acycle, and much of my own work is in connection with this.All of these activities and functions of the Hierarchy are well known to many ofyou theoretically, and to some at first hand—which is a good and useful thing torecognise. These activities have all been carried on “behind the veil” and are,of course, only a very small part of the total work of the Hierarchy. Much of itwould be entirely incomprehensible to you. However, if the disciples of thismodern world, and the initiates, can measure up to their present and presentedopportunity, it should be possible for all of this not only to be carriedforward in the full light of day, but with the cooperation and the understandingacceptance of the intelligent people everywhere, and also with the devotedacquiescence (though blind acceptance) of the man in the street.[521] Something of this, something of the new activities which will be broughtto the attention of disciples in physical bodies, something of the scope of theundertaking of externalisation, something of what all of you can do to preparethe way for this major change, and something of the tremendous difficultiesinvolved, I am seeking to convey to you, if I can.One of the things now occupying the attention of the Masters is theexternalisation of their ashrams on the outer plane. This is preparatory tolater envisioned developments. If this can be done then other developments maybe possible. An extension of the ashram is desired. It was with this in viewthat I inaugurated a new activity in May 1941 and chose so many of my disciplesresident in New York. I also began to give out the teaching on the stages ofdiscipleship (Discipleship in the New Age, Vol. I, Section III) and suggestedthat the group members meet together for one full afternoon around the time ofthe full moon each month, and to do this in a quiet and unhurried spirit. Idesired that they spend the entire afternoon in conference, mutualunderstanding, discussion of group problems as these affect group service,and—above all—make an attempt (through deep united meditation and the pooling ofknowledge) to approach closer to the Hierarchy. This would aid them to worktogether as a group for world aiding and to do it together . I asked them tostudy the relation which exists between a Master and His disciples.These groups, indicated for externalisation, exist on the inner side as part ofone inner Group; they must be externalised for service purposes. The fact thatthis externalisation is possible indicates certain developments which are theresult of the past, of the unfoldment of humanity’s developing powers torecognise Reality, of the invocative cry of the masses everywhere, plus thedirected invocation of the spiritual people of the world, and the effect of theworld war (1914-1945). All these factors have wrought a great destruction in thematerialistic world and have produced a very real expansion in the humanconsciousness; also, as one [522] of the Masters, unknown to you, remarked at ameeting of Members of the Hierarchy a few weeks ago, “One of the gates is open;those who are ready can come in, but we now can go through it also, and can goto them in a new sense and more directly. May Shamballa help us.”It is realised by all in the Hierarchy that the major test connected with ahigher initiation confronts Them. Disciples should attempt to realise thetremendous sacrifice involved in this outward move of the Hierarchy into secularexistence. The higher the state of initiation, the harder it will be for theinitiate concerned. It is, for instance, less of an effort for me to contact youthan it would be for some of the Chohans, such as the Masters M. and K.H. I amnearer to you, because I am still utilising the same physical body in which Itook the fifth initiation, nearly ninety years ago. Chohans have taken a stillhigher initiation and are focal points of powerful Ashrams; Their task ofadjustment is very much harder. Their invocative appeal to the Lord of the Worldin His Council Chamber at Shamballa has been mounting for some time. It has beencalled “The Appeal for Alignment” because the Members of the Hierarchy feel andknow that this great return to Earth which has been arranged for the Hierarchyafter so long an absence, will call for a fuller expression of the spiritualwill than even They realise; They know that it will require the cooperation ofShamballa as well as the cooperation of humanity.What I have to say about the externalisation of the Hierarchy and its Ashramscould well be divided for the sake of clarity into the following points whichwill form the basis of the instruction. We shall attempt to follow this outline.Hierarchical Adjustment and Alignment:Within Itself.In connection with the Council Chamber of Sanat Kumara. Little can be said aboutthis.In relation with humanity.You will note that this involves the three planetary centres. [523]Hierarchical preparation at the Wesak Festival.The Mode of Approach towards Externalisation.Steps in the externalisation process.Approach via certain Ashrams.In the consciousness of the disciple in physical expression.Through dissemination of information of a preparatory nature.The Externalisation itself. This involves:The Return of the Christ.The Ashrams concerned at the Coming.The organisation of the implicated Ashrams into due form on earth.The externalisation of the Ashrams.Adjustment of the Ashrams and the Masters to exoteric living.It will involve also adjustment by disciples and aspirants to the increasedstimulation, and the enunciation of certain basic statements.The Work of the Externalised Ashrams.Creating and vitalising the new world religion.The gradual reorganising of the social order.The public inauguration of the system of initiation.The exoteric training of disciples and of humanity in this new cycle.We can begin on our first point, but only those students who are an integralpart of the Hierarchy and in active communication with some Ashram can profit inany measure by information on this subject. For example, those of you who areaffiliated with my Ashram (or that of another of the Masters), and going throughyour preliminary training and functioning on the periphery of the hierarchicalcentre can get a general idea and develop (if you attempt to do so) an [524]intuitive perception of the proposed hierarchical integrity and futurefunctioning.Resent not my words “functioning on the periphery,” for they indicate greatopportunity for service. The Masters need many such as you on the outskirts ofTheir Ashrams, to aid in hierarchical endeavour, because you can reach thegeneral public more easily than They can do, and you can step down the teachingfar more adequately than could more advanced disciples. You and disciples likeyou are a definite part of the Hierarchy; as you function in an Ashram you havea most useful place, and I would beg you to have this ever in mind. I will,therefore, give you whatever information I can and which is permissible, butshall of necessity have to leave much unsaid.Hierarchical Adjustment and AlignmentWhat do I mean by the use of the word “adjustment” in connection with theHierarchy? Adjustment to karma, to the personality, to the soul, tocircumstances in the three worlds, to the impact of astral forces, or to thethought currents of those not oriented to the Kingdom of God, does notconstitute part of the training of Those Who are beyond the third degree ofinitiation. Initiates on and beyond that level have transcended reaction alongthese lines, whilst those below the third initiation are in process of rapidadjustment. I use the word 'adjustment' here definitely in the sense ofreorientation, and in this sense much can be noted.For aeons and for countless cycles, the Hierarchy has functioned withdrawn intoa silence on the higher levels of the mental plane and on the buddhic levelswhere contact has had to be made with Them by those disciples who have, bydiscipline, development and service, fitted themselves to establish such arelationship. This reorientation and emergence into physical plane publicity isgoing to demand much from the Members of the Hierarchy. Just as it has not beeneasy for me to establish and retain contact with you, even when you haveestablished the right to such a contact, [525] so—for Them—it is going to bestill more difficult to be in touch with those who are not even disciples.For aeons and for cycles, the Members of the Hierarchy have been submittingThemselves to the needed training in order to react correctly when fullercontact has been established by Shamballa with the Hierarchy. I would have younote the phrasing here. That contact has now been established as a result of theinflow of certain extra-planetary forces and by an “act of determineddirection,” emanating from the Council Chamber of the Lord of the World.Misunderstand me not. The Hierarchy has always been in touch with the “Place ofPurpose” (as it has been called) through the medium of its Chohans and itssenior Directors, such as the Christ, the Manu and the Lord of Civilisation.These great Beings have steadily revealed this purpose to the Members of theHierarchy so that They have been able to grasp and work out the emerging Plan.But even to the Masters the Shamballa force has had to be stepped down, just asthe force of the Hierarchy requires modifying for the average disciple andaspirant, if they are to respond constructively to it.Today, however, things are somewhat changed. New inflowing energies and thepartial “sealing” of evil in its own place (a sealing which will beprogressively effective) have made a closer relationship possible. The Mastersare somewhat freer from certain of the arduous labours of the past cycles. Someof the available inflowing Shamballa forces are being absorbed directly byhumanity and by certain of the subhuman kingdoms, particularly the mineralkingdom. This latter absorption will lead eventually, when complete, to thosevolcanic episodes and those basic earthquakes which will change the face of theearth by the time the sixth rootrace comes into manifestation. It is this directinflow to the kingdoms functioning exoterically in the three worlds which hasrelieved and will to some extent relieve the otherwise overpowering pressureupon the Hierarchy, and will also act as a great aligning antahkarana betweenthe three planetary centres. It is to this alignment I refer in thisinstruction—[526] the alignment of the three centres upon this planet and theadjustments that this necessitates and inevitably enforces.For the sake of humanity in the first place, and secondarily for the developmentof the subhuman kingdoms, the Hierarchy has made certain difficult adjustmentsand alignments between the planetary centres, and these have been compulsory intheir effects. Therefore, bear in mind that the adjustments which the Hierarchymay impose upon itself bear small resemblance to the adjustments which you haveto make in relation to your personality life. They are all hallmarked by theidea of service to the whole. The Hierarchy in its true sense has no personalitythrough which to express itself, and this greatly complicates the problems whichhave to be faced as it contemplates exoteric manifestation and work.Adjustments and Alignments within the HierarchyWhat, in the last analysis, is this Hierarchy? It is a great salvaging corps ofdedicated, liberated Units of Life, working in group formation with all formsand lives in all kingdoms and with all souls particularly. As the Hierarchy soworks, its emphasis is solely on the consciousness aspect of all forms; itspresent agency of salvage and of service is the mind, as it expresses itselfthrough the minds of all humanitarians, all aspirants, all disciples (of allrays and degrees) and of all initiates; the Hierarchy also can express itselfthrough the medium of thought currents and ideas and through them impose itshierarchical concepts upon the embryonic minds of the general and averagepublic; and it also directs the educational work of all nations, so that theundeveloped masses can become—in due turn—the intelligent general public.The Hierarchy works, as you know, in or through three major departments, eachpossessing its full Personnel, and under three Great Lords. I have dealt withthis in some detail in Initiation, Human and Solar, as well as elsewhere [527]in my writings; more information at this point is needless and of no realservice to you.The Hierarchy works also through the seven major Ashrams and their affiliatedAshrams, and these “seven which are the forty-nine” represent in their totalitythe seven rays with their subrays, and are the custodians, transmitters anddistributors of the seven ray energies to the seven planetary centres and—viathese seven centres—to those in the fourth kingdom in nature (as they graduallyunfold over the aeons) and then, via these, to the seven centres in individualman. Such is the synthesis.The seven major centres or Ashrams within the Hierarchy are each presided overby Masters of Chohan rank; the seven subsidiary centres or Ashrams are presidedover by Masters and Adepts (of the fifth and fourth initiations), aided byinitiates of the third degree and certain picked and senior disciples. Severalof the seven affiliated Ashrams are, as yet, incomplete as regards personnel,but vacancies are rapidly being filled as the spiritual effects of the world war(1914-1945) make themselves felt. These effects are very real and have been asource of great encouragement to hierarchical workers.Before the Hierarchy can emerge (as is the intention), the relation between amajor Ashram and its subsidiary Ashrams must be firmly established, whilst thatbetween a major Ashram and other major Ashrams has to be brought more definitelyand unquestionably closer to Shamballa, and under the influence of that greatfirst ray centre. The energy which will align and adjust the subsidiaryforty-nine Ashrams is that of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. That, however,which will bring about a similar adjusting and aligning impetus in the sevenmajor Ashrams is the energy of the first Ray of Will or Power. I have here givenyou a most important item of occult information, but one which is of noimportance to you individually; it serves, however, to present proof of thesignificant occult relation between the three planetary centres. Just as thethird planetary centre, Humanity, has now reached a point of intelligentdevelopment [528] so that a closer rapport can be set up between it and theHierarchy, so the Hierarchy also has moved forward as a unit so that a closercorresponding rapport can also be set up between It and Shamballa. Just as therapport between the Hierarchy and Humanity is established via aspirants,disciples and initiates in physical existence who are responding to thelove-wisdom of the universe in some measure and who work via the intelligentpeople in incarnation primarily, so rapport between Shamballa and the Hierarchyis being more closely established via the senior Ashrams, and not via thesecondary ones. You have, therefore, a situation which might be depictedsomewhat as follows:I. First Planetary Centre . . . . . . . . . . . Shamballaworking through1. The seven Rays or the seven Spirits before the Throne.2. Certain great Intermediaries.3. The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World.II. Second Planetary Centre . . . . . . . . Hierarchyworking through1. The seven major Chohans and Their Ashrams.2. The forty-nine Masters of the secondary Ashrams.3. The sum total of the secondary Ashrams.III. Third Planetary Centre . . . . . . . . . Humanityworking through1. Disciples in manifestation—of the seven ray types.2. The New Group of World Servers.3. The sum total of humanitarians, educators and men of goodwill.This is but a rough picture and one which is not totally correct; it will,however, show you certain direct lines of contact and of relationship which aretrue and which will suffice to [529] give you a vague and general idea of thenew alignment being set up between the three major planetary centres, requiringnew adjustments.At this particular time, the emphasis of the needed alignments and adjustmentswith which the Hierarchy is faced is being placed upon activity within theHierarchy Itself . The secondary Ashrams are being stimulated; new ones arebeing gradually formed, for there are not as yet forty-nine minor Ashrams;vacancies in the major Ashrams are being filled as rapidly as possible from theranks of those working in minor Ashrams and the places of these latter are beingtaken by accepted disciples who are being fitted for this work throughexperience, difficulties and the tension of world service. All these changesnecessitate much adjustment. The interior work of hierarchical alignment is inthe charge of the Chohans of the Major Ashrams, whilst the task ofsuperintending the interior adjustments incident to new alignments and theadmission of new personnel is being watched over and directed by the forty-nineMasters who are in charge of minor Ashrams—either Ashrams with what is regardedas a full complement of workers, or Ashrams in process of attaining that fullcomplement, or embryonic Ashrams of which there are already quite a few.One of the results of this hierarchical alignment and adjustment will be theestablishment, for the first time, of a fluid interplay and movement between thethree planetary centres. Chohans are today passing out of the Hierarchy into theCouncil Chamber of the Lord of the World, or on to one or other of the SevenPaths; senior Masters in charge of Ashrams are taking higher grades ofinitiation and taking the rank of Chohans; initiates above the third degree arerapidly taking the fourth and fifth initiations and becoming Masters (takingboth initiations in one life), and their places are being taken by lesserinitiates; these, in their turn, have been training disciples to take theirplaces, until in this process of substitution and replacement we arrive at thedoor which symbolically stands between humanity and the Hierarchy, and todaystands wide open, so that accepted [530] disciples are taking initiation,pledged disciples are being accepted, and accepting disciples are taking theirpledges.Thus a great and new movement is proceeding and a tremendously increasedinterplay and interaction is taking place. This will go on until A.D. 2025.During the years intervening between now and then very great changes will beseen taking place, and at the great General Assembly of the Hierarchy—held asusual every century—in 2025 the date in all probability will be set for thefirst stage of the externalisation of the Hierarchy. The present cycle (from nowuntil that date) is called technically “The Stage of the Forerunner”. It ispreparatory in nature, testing in its methods, and intended to be revelatory inits techniques and results. You can see therefore that Chohans, Masters,initiates, world disciples, disciples and aspirants affiliated with theHierarchy are all at this time passing through a cycle of great activity.In the adjustment necessitated by the rapidly advancing alignment, the Membersof the Hierarchy are fitting Themselves for the objective work of publicexpression. This entails far more difficulty than you might imagine oranticipate, because it entails the development of that form of “resistance tothe pull of the lower vibration” of which you can know nothing, for that lowervibration is a necessary aspect of your normal expression—little as you may liketo realise this. You need to realise that there is nothing in the Masters orhigher initiates which can respond to any vibration of this nature. Though Theycannot absorb it or react to it or re-develop it again, it can cause Them theacutest discomfort and pain; that is the reason why the Son of God was called inThe Old Testament a “man of sorrows and acquainted with grief”. This did not inreality refer to His sufferings for poor miserable humanity (as orthodoxtheology so selfishly interprets it) but to the fact that He had to submitHimself to contact with humanity. The Hierarchy is therefore, along all lines(many of which I may not indicate or upon which I may not enlarge), preparingItself for the experience of physical manifestation; It is also endeavouring to“create” the needed responsive apparatus which will be of such a nature that[531] Members of the Hierarchy may function with the minimum of difficulty onearth and will experience the least possible measure of handicap; They will thusbe enabled to give full time and attention to the work to be done by Them inphysical manifestation.They are endeavouring also to establish a closer telepathic rapport and a moreintimate (though strictly impersonal) relationship with Their disciples on allrays, so that there can be a free interplay of thought and a consequent betterhierarchical integrity and one which—no matter what may happen in the threeworlds—cannot be disrupted or in any way lessened.Although for Them no astral plane exists and glamour is entirely non-existent,They have to learn to do a most peculiar thing: to work on the astral plane(because it exists for humanity and for the animal kingdom), to traverse thisregion of glamour and then to “demonstrate light in dissipating fog” in a mannerfor which there has hitherto been no call. None of this information may makemuch sense to you, but I am simply seeking to go on record for the sake of thosewho will come after you. There is little more that I may give you anentadjustment and alignment within the Hierarchy. It is rapidly proceeding, andjust in so far as disciples demonstrate upon the outer physical plane and in thethree worlds their affiliation with an Ashram will they share in this dualprocess. Are you prepared for this?In Connection with the Council Chamber of Sanat Kumara, the Lord of the WorldAs this subject concerns one of the seven goals towards which the Masters aimafter They have attained the fifth initiation, it will be obvious to you thatthere is little that I can say about it. One of the seven Paths for which theWay of the Higher Evolution prepares the senior initiates is the Path of EarthService. This Path, as you know, keeps the Masters attached to service in thethree worlds for a period much longer than the average. It involves tremendoussacrifice. [532] Just as the disciple has to live a dual life, with one part ofhis reflective nature and awareness centred in the life of the Hierarchy and theother part of his mental responsiveness equally centred on life in the threeworlds, and this simultaneously, so the Master, when He chooses this Path, formsa constituent part of the Council Chamber of the Lord of the World and at thesame time works consciously in the three worlds, via the Hierarchy (of which Heremains also a part), and with the human and subhuman kingdoms in nature. Asevolution proceeds, He will work increasingly via humanity because humanity willbe shouldering its responsibilities as the Macrocosm of the lesser microcosm.This dual activity entails much specialised training, and as the initiatoryprocess becomes exoteric and men everywhere recognise it and participate in it,the training which Members of the Hierarchy also undergo will not be so secretand mysterious as it is today. But the time has not yet come to publicise it.Only certain further generalisations are here possible, some of which arealready known to you because they are so broad that their inclusions andimplications are obvious. This, for instance, concerns the “centre where theWill of God is known”. Here at Shamballa work Those Who have unified Theirpersonality will and Their spiritual will with the universal will, and such aunification inevitably brings knowledge. It is, however, not knowledge as youunderstand it. It is a blend of wisdom based on knowledge, understanding basedon intuitive perception, and identification based on alignment, esotericallycomprehended. For this peculiar condition or awareness we have no word in anylanguage, and only the utilisation (the trained utilisation) of the abstractmind can possibly convey to you even an embryonic factual conception. But thattype of imaginative conception will become more common during the next twocenturies, and my words here will therefore serve an ultimate purpose. Those Whoform the Council Chamber of the Great Lord are under no misapprehension as toHis will because They [533] see it whole . Paul, the initiate, hints at thiswhen writing one of the Epistles; he is in touch then with certain Members ofthe Hierarchy and is concerned with the theme of Love, which is the fundamentalhierarchical theme and motive. He says to Them: “Now we see through a glassdarkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then shall we know evenas we are known.” He there points towards the future progress of the Hierarchy—aprogress which remains as yet only a vague promise, lacking form and shape. Buthe wrote for initiates to whom love was a growing, vital concern, and to whomlove and its practice meant light and the basic motif of all living, divineactivity. It is not possible to reveal the will of God and the motivatingPurpose of His manifesting Self, except to Those Who have demonstrated perfectedlove and Who register no sense of disunion or the faintest reaction toseparateness.At Shamballa, the Great Lives Who function there not only see manifestationwhole and apart from all the limitations of time, but They feel all the majorevolutionary impulses which are bringing the developing world into line with thedivine Will. They embody those impulses not in terms of progressive movement,but in terms of one great divine and spiritual reaction. This idea can perhapsbe best understood by you in terms of the Eternal AUM which is the symbol of theEternal NOW. You have been told, and it has been demonstrated, that the AUM iscomposed of one major Sound, three minor sounds, and seven subsidiary vibratorytones. So it is with the Will of God which is embodied and held in synthesis bythe Members of the Council Chamber. To Them, as They “hold the Will of God insolution, it is one clear note; as They see that Will in motion, it is threeabiding chords, carrying outwards into all the worlds the Purpose of the ONE Whofor aeons will abide; as They impel that Will to demonstrate, it is sevenvibratory tones, drawing out into the reflected worlds the structure of thePlan. And thus the note, the chords and tone produce the Plan, reveal thePurpose and indicate God’s Will.” This [534] is a quotation from certain of theancient Archives which constitute the study of the Masters; they relate to thenature of Shamballa, its work and emanating energies.Shamballa, as it constitutes the synthesis of understanding where our Earth isconcerned, is also the centre where the highest Will of the Solar Logos isimposed upon the Will of our planetary Logos, Who is, as you know, only a centrein His greater body of manifestation. With this item of information you can haveno possible concern; the Masters Themselves are only learning the Will of theplanetary Logos; the objective of effort in Shamballa is, however, theapprehension of solar Purpose, the Plan of which is working out on the highestlevels of our planetary system, just as the Will, Purpose and Plan of Shamballawork out on the three lowest levels of our planetary system. Again, this item ofinformation serves only to indicate hierarchical objectives, and thoseobjectives extend away from time and space into the Mind of God Himself.There are certain synonyms which here may serve to develop your syntheticthinking and so bring in a definite measure of enlightenment.SHAMBALLA HIERARCHY HUMANITY Synthesis Unity Separation Will Purpose Plan LifeSoul Appearance Spirit Consciousness Substance Livingness Organism OrganisationApprehension Polarisation Focus of Activity Power Momentum Action EnergyDistribution Forces Direction Transmission Reception Head Heart ThroatIt will be apparent to you how little you can understand of the Shamballaintention when you realise that it is not easy for you to see any truedistinction between unity and synthesis and, at the same time, how impossible itis for me [535] to make the distinction clear. All I can say is that synthesisis , whilst unity is achieved and is the reward of action and effort. As youprogress upon the Path of Initiation the meaning of unity clarifies. As youdirect yourself towards the Way of the Higher Evolution synthesis emerges. Morethan that it would be useless for me to say.This problem of the apparently impenetrable darkness of intention as grasped byShamballa, of meaning, of inscrutability, of a spiritual imperviousness whichholds , in spite of all fluctuations in the three worlds of human evolution andthe remaining two of superhuman unfoldment, provides a situation to which theHierarchy has to make adjustment through alignment. You are, in your small way,making your adjustment to the Hierarchy through a steady construction of theantahkarana, and in so doing are aiding in the construction of the antahkaranawhich unites Humanity and the Hierarchy—the first few strands of which wereestablished through the sacrifices of certain of the Sons of God when theHierarchy was founded on Earth. Today, the Hierarchy is working at theestablishing of the linking strands between Itself and Shamballa, and goodprogress has already been made. It might be said here that for the past sevenhundred years the chain of Hierarchy has been complete; by this I mean that theplanetary rainbow bridge uniting the three major centres has existed. The taskahead of all these three major centres, working in alignment through adjustment,is to strengthen and beautify (if I may so express it), to electrify thisbridge, thus producing full planetary intercommunication between the threecentres and the four minor centres, so that “the weight of the Will of God, themomentum of the Purpose of Sanat Kumara and the Plan of His Representatives mayprogress unimpeded from point to point, from sphere to sphere and from glory toglory.”It is this complete establishment of relationship between Shamballa, theHierarchy and Humanity which brought about the planetary crisis through whichthe world has just passed and, from some standpoints, is still passing. [536]Shamballa, as I have told you, can now reach Humanity, the third major centre,directly, and therefore has two points of planetary contact: the first, via theHierarchy, as has been for long the case, and secondly, in a straight line,carrying energy direct to Humanity, without any transmission and consequentmodifying of impact, as has also been the case hitherto. When this direct lineof spiritual, dynamic, electrical energy made its first impact on earth (afterthe Great Council held in 1825), it first of all awakened men’s thinking in anew and comprehensive way, producing the great ideologies; it aroused theirmassed desire, and registered obstruction on the physical plane. It found itscourse impeded and discovered it was faced with barriers. This energy fromShamballa, being an aspect of the ray of the destroyer, proceeded to “burn up”in the fires of destruction, all such hindrances upon the planes in the threeworlds. This was the deeply esoteric and unrecognised cause of the war—thebeneficent bringing to an end of the impediments to the free flow of spiritualenergy down into the third centre; this was the factor which called “evil fromits hidden place” and brought the opposing forces to the surface of existence,prior to their “sealing”. To the extent that this was so, mankind in the WorldWar (1914-1945) was the unhappy victim of spiritual circumstance; however, fromthe angle of man’s historical past, humanity was the engineer of its own fate;but it took both the esoteric activity of Shamballa and the exoteric activity ofhumanity over a millennia of years to precipitate the conditions which made thisnew alignment possible and brought about the sealing (still being carried slowlyforward), and plunged mankind into the vortex of war. This impelling downpouringenergy from the highest centre penetrated not only to the heart of humanity, butinto the very depths of the mineral kingdom, implicating also the animal and thevegetable expressions of divine life.Because of this direct impact between Shamballa and Humanity, by-passing theHierarchy, the Hierarchy was left free for the work of rehabilitation andsalvaging, for reconstruction and for the application of the regenerative forcesof [537] resurrection. The Hierarchy needed and welcomed this interlude andrecognised it as an essential aspect of the Plan.The “cycle of Shamballa impact” is now over; the appeal of humanity to theChrist and His Hierarchy has again refocussed the energy of Shamballa via theHierarchy, and the direct work of the Hierarchy with Humanity can again take onfresh meaning, can be re-established on new and somewhat different lines, andthus definitely bring in that “new heaven and new earth” for which men have solong waited. This will take time, but the new energies and their emergingqualities are adequate to the task, and will alleviate much and bring aboutgreat changes in due course of time. You will note, therefore, that theHierarchy has been faced with three adjustments as the result of beingdeliberately “put out of alignment,” though only temporarily, with bothShamballa and Humanity. This was symbolised for us at the Crucifixion when theSaviour hung pendant between heaven and earth. These adjustments are:1. Adjustment to those extra-planetary energies which were released into thehighest centre. This was made possible by two factors:a. The direct impact between Shamballa and Humanity or between will andintelligence. This is an important point to recognise.b. The temporary quiescence of the love principle, as the Hierarchy waited forthe results and effects of this direct impact upon the earth.This was effectively carried out with much destruction in the world of forms.2. Adjustment to certain basic changes within the Hierarchy Itself inpreparation for the process of externalisation which was begun this century.3. Adjustment to a disciplined and reoriented humanity, [538] working today inthe dark, it is needless to say, groping along unknown ways, appealing to theHierarchy for more light and understanding, but awakened and alert for changes.These adjustments are proceeding with rapidity; the technique being employed isrealignment, through a definite action of the Will, as far as Shamballa isconcerned, and by an outpouring of Love, as far as humanity is concerned. ThisAct of the Will is carried out by the three Heads of Departments in theHierarchy, under the guidance of the Christ and by the Chohans of the sevenmajor Ashrams. They constitute a group of ten to Whom this task has beencommitted, for the reason that They are the only Members of the Hierarchy Whopossess the needed qualifications and in Whom the Will aspect is adequatelydeveloped. The task of pouring out the Love principle in a new and dynamicmanner is being carried out by all the Masters and by all initiates who havetaken the third initiation. This stream of love will focus itself each comingFull Moon in a special act or demonstration of love.You will note also how fully occupied the Hierarchy is with work, preparatory toemergence, and with those plans and activities which will lead to renewedinterior activity, based not on lack of previous unity and integrity, but on theabsorption of new energies, made available via Shamballa, of theseextra-planetary forces to which I have earlier referred. This task ofreorganisation prior to moving outward, will be completed by May, 1946. Then thetask of the new alignment with humanity will be started and the great workundertaken which will proceed for several hundred years.In Relation with HumanityI shall not deal here with the work to be done in centuries to come in andthrough humanity, which is the goal of all these adjustments—at least as far asyour present interest is concerned. I shall touch only upon the activities ofthe Hierarchy as it establishes—on a more powerful [539] basis—a more directcontact with mankind. Since 1925 the Hierarchy has directed Its thoughts to men,but It has not vitalised, as It will eventually do, the religious movements orchurches in all lands, or the educational work in all countries, or any of theactivities which are concerned with the aiding of humanity through welfaremovements. It was felt that it was necessary for mankind to show the Hierarchy,as well as themselves, the nature of the impulses towards love and selflessnesswhich may have been already established, and to do this free of hierarchicalprompting and influence, and in this way demonstrating that they possessed thatwhich might be depended upon as innate and as present in a living, creativemanner. The demonstration has been good ; humanity has shown creative love, ofwhich goodwill and humanitarian efforts are the lowest aspects. The showing hasbeen better than was anticipated, and this new and vital re-alignment betweenthe Hierarchy and Humanity becomes now beautifully possible and can be carriedforward without danger. The Hierarchy is now the Custodian of far greater powerthan heretofore, on account of Its adjustment to Shamballa.This hierarchical readjustment to humanity is being carried out at this time inthe Ashrams by the setting up of magnetic centres which, through their directedactivity, will influence humanity in the coming large scale process ofreorientation. In studying this, you must remember that these are not centres orconcentrations of forces, but groups of disciples whose quality is orientedtowards mankind and whose potency of thought will act magnetically uponaspirants and humanitarians and, through them and their goodwill activities,will reach and impress men everywhere. The adjustment being at this timeundertaken, therefore, is between hierarchical groups and groups of men andwomen upon earth; it is intended, as you have been told, that Humanity itselfwill be the world-saviour, working with the aid of the Hierarchy—as yetinvisibly behind the scenes. When this interim work of salvage is accomplished,then the Hierarchy will externalise Itself.[540] You can imagine the adjustments, therefore, going on in all the Ashrams inpreparation for all this and—though I touch not upon it—you can imagine thegeneral effect of these inter-hierarchical adjustments and alignments upondisciples and aspirants upon the earth; they are the first, needless to say, whowill respond to this activity. As all this is taking place in the presentdifficult period of world rehabilitation, the immensity of the problem involvedand the quality of the tension are abnormal. It is not easy for disciples today;of this the Hierarchy is well aware. This fact also involves for Them stillanother aspect of hierarchical adjustment. They have—for the sake of the work tobe done—to establish a closer alignment between the inner Ashrams and the outergroups, between Themselves and Their senior disciples carrying the burden of theouter world service; this alignment has also to be extended between seniordisciples and initiates and the workers on earth.The pureness of the motives animating the Hierarchy will constantly emerge withgreater clarity in your minds, as you attempt to understand, even in a smallmeasure, Their problems. There are other problems of which you can knownothing—problems related to the new energies pouring into our planet,impersonally and dynamically; problems of fresh tensions, incident to strongerand new alignments; problems concerned with human enlightenments and reactionsin the face of the darkness which evil initiated; problems of increasedpersonnel, disturbing the rhythm but necessitated by the demand for workers;problems connected with the growth and training of the Members of the Hierarchyupon the Way of the Higher Evolution; other problems incident to the planetarycrisis, to the Initiation of the Lord of the World Himself, and to the amazingdemonstration of the success of the evolutionary process up to the present time.This success has been proven by the alignment for direct interplay of the threemajor planetary centres—Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity.HIERARCHICAL PREPARATION AT THE WESAK FESTIVALApril-May 1946[541] I have delayed writing my usual Wesak message until this late date becauseof a certain event in the Hierarchy which was maturing and which necessitated myentire attention. This event was connected with the Wesak Festival and involvedamong other matters the formation of a new Ashram in which the Wisdom aspectwould be of particular importance and not the Love aspect; this Ashram wouldalso be related in a peculiar manner to the Buddha. It had to be formed at thistime in order to be the recipient, and then the custodian, of certain“endowments” which the Buddha will bring at the time of the May Full Moon. Theendowments concern the will-to-good of the Lord of the World, the Ancient ofDays, though they do not concern goodwill as you understand that phrase. ThisAshram, when duly formed and established, will enable the Members of theHierarchy to respond to this aspect of the divine Purpose—the Purpose which asyou know lies behind and implements the Plan; this Ashram, related to theBuddha, will be specifically under the close supervision of the Christ, and alsoof the Lord of Civilisation—at this time the Master R. They are the only twoMembers of the Hierarchy able to register the divine Purpose (in regard to itsimmediate objectives) in such a manner that the entire Hierarchy can be informedand can then work unitedly and intelligently at its implementation. More thanthis I may not tell you about this particular hierarchical move, affecting as itdoes both Shamballa and the Hierarchy.This Wesak Festival is of supreme importance because it is the first Festivalsince the war ended, because it takes place at a time when a definiteorientation of the Hierarchy will take place, and because a fresh tide ofspiritual impulse and directed second ray energy will flood the entireHierarchy; the work, therefore, to be done by the Hierarchy will be far moreeffective. This you may anticipate and upon this you can count.[542] But—as you may well have surmised—it is the Full Moon of June which is(this year) the season of prime and outstanding importance; it is in many wayseasier for Western believers and esotericists to tune in and participate in theactivities of the Hierarchy when closely connected with the Christ than it is inthose related to the Buddha. The main intention in these early stages of keepingthe Eastern Festival of Wesak is to familiarise the Western world with the factof the presence of the Buddha and with His activities in connection withhumanity. Such great progress has, however, taken place in the spiritualdevelopment of humanity that the Buddha need no longer continue with His taskunless He so desires—and then only for a period of years, known to Him and theLord of the World. He could cease His annual contact with the Hierarchy at thistime, if He so chose, owing to the direct contact now established between theHierarchy and Shamballa. This, however, He does not immediately choose to do.For a few decades longer He will cooperate with the Christ in widening thechannel of contact between Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity. After that, Hewill “proceed to His Own place” in the solar Hierarchy and will no longer visitthe Himalayas annually, as has been His custom for so many centuries. TheEastern Festival of Wesak (Vaisaka) and the Christian day of remembrance, GoodFriday, will fade out of the consciousness of humanity in due time; they areboth festivals related to aspects of the first Ray of Power or Will. Theabolition of the fear of death and the establishment of a close relation of theHierarchy with Shamballa will render obsolete these ancient ceremonial rites.In this message I would like to consider with you primarily the Festival of theChrist, held at the time of the Full Moon of June, and the work of the Christ asHe prepares Himself for the fulfilment of His true mission on Earth. TheChristian Church has so distorted that mission and ruthlessly perverted theintention for which He originally manifested that a consideration of thatmission is deeply needed and should be revolutionary in its effects. Starting[543] with St. Paul, the theologians interpreted His words in such a manner thatthey served to bridge the gap between the spiritual future of the world and theJewish dispensation which should have been passing out. So effective has beentheir work that the teachings of the loving, simple Son of God have been largelyignored; the failure of Christianity can be traced to its Jewish background(emphasised by St. Paul), which made it full of propaganda instead of lovingaction, which taught the blood sacrifice instead of loving service, and whichemphasised the existence of a wrathful God, needing to be placated by death, andwhich embodied the threats of the Old Testament Jehovah in the Christianteaching of hell fire.This situation is one which the Christ is seeking to alter; it has been inpreparation for His instituting a new and more correct presentation of divinetruth that I have sought—with love and understanding—to point out the faults ofthe world religions, with their obsolete theologies and their lack of love, andto indicate the evils of Judaism. The present world faiths must return to theirearly simplicity, and orthodox Judaism, with its deep-seated hate, must slowlydisappear; all must be changed in preparation for the revelation which Christwill bring.The first things which the Christ will do, beginning with this full Moon ofJune, will be to prepare all people everywhere (if possible through theirregenerated, religious institutions) for the revelation for which all humanitywaits.It is this revelation which lies behind all the activities which now engross theattention of the Hierarchy. There have been many revelations of divine purposedown the ages, each of which uniquely altered the point of view and the patternof living for men everywhere. There was the ancient revelation, given throughthe people of India, as to the existence of the Self and the Not-Self—arevelation which is now coming to have meaning through the teaching of modernpsychology; there was the revelation of the Ten Commandments, given through theJews and—because of the negativity shown then and today by the Jews—given [544]in a negative and not a positive form. The Christ endeavoured to offset andbring to an end the need for the Ten Commandments, by giving us the eleventhcommandment; this, if kept, would entail the keeping of all the others. Therewas the revelation which Christ Himself gave, summing it up for us in His lifeof service, in the love which He preached and in His constant repudiation oftheological Judaism (the Sadducees and the Pharisees). This difficulty withJudaism still persists and is symbolised for us in the failure to recognise theMessiah when He came to them in their own country and let it be known that Hecame to the whole world and not to the Jews alone.For this new revelation the Christ is preparing as are all the members of theHierarchy, from the highest Chohan down to the humblest accepted disciple; it isfor this that all the ashrams are getting ready; it is for this also that (in aweak and feeble manner) Christian people, those of the other world faiths, andspiritually minded people are likewise preparing.Therefore, we have isolated (if I may use such a word) three activities to whichthe Christ is at this time dedicated:1. The reorganisation of the world religions—if in any way possible—so thattheir out-of-date theologies, their narrow-minded emphasis and their ridiculousbelief that they know what is in the Mind of God may be offset, in order thatthe churches may eventually be the recipients of spiritual inspiration.2. The gradual dissolution—again if in any way possible—of the orthodox Jewishfaith, with its obsolete teaching, its separative emphasis, its hatred of theGentiles and its failure to recognise the Christ. In saying this I do not failto recognise those Jews throughout the world who acknowledge the evils and whoare not orthodox in their thinking; they belong to the aristocracy of spiritualbelief to which the Hierarchy itself belongs. [545]3. Preparation for a revelation which will inaugurate the new era and set thenote for the new world religion.To these three efforts of the Hierarchy, superintended by the Christ, anothertwo must be added, of perhaps even greater importance. The first one is thereaction of the Hierarchy itself to the new relationship established between Itand Shamballa and to that new, direct and potent channel which has lately beeninduced by the efforts of the Hierarchy and human invocativeness. The secondactivity is one leading towards a much closer relation between the Hierarchy andHumanity; this will lead eventually to the externalisation of certain of theAshrams, and later to the appearance of the Hierarchy on earth, bringing the newrevelation.These various efforts may appear to the casual reader as relatively unimportant.This is a superficial point of view and one which meets with little sympathyfrom the Hierarchy. That the Jews should be rid of fear is of major importance;that they should know and recognise the Christ as the Messiah, and thereforefind for themselves that the religion they follow is destructive of many of thefiner values, is likewise of major importance; that orthodox Judaism, along withall the other faiths, should realise that there is no desire to make themChristian (in the ordinary sense of the term), but that they should all movetowards some loving synthesis and eliminate their mutual antagonisms andrivalries is equally urgent, and this statement includes the Christian faiths aswell. That the Vatican cease its political scheming, its exploitation of themasses and its emphasis upon ignorance is as important; that the manifolddivisions of the Protestant churches be bridged is imperative. If none of thesethings happen, humanity is headed towards a religious war which will make thepast war appear like child’s play; antagonisms and hatreds will embroil entirepopulations and the politicians of all the nations will take full advantage ofthe situation to precipitate a war which may well prove the end of humanity.There are [546] no hatreds so great or so deep as those fostered by religion.The Christ, therefore, has to add to all the many objectives which occupy Hisattention still another—the effort to avert a final war. This incipient war iscontrary to the will-to-good of the Lord of the World and any world plan; it canbe averted by goodwill. This is the most important statement in this message, asfar as humanity is concerned.Great and stirring events are imminent, and they will take place when the effectof the new Invocation is more pronounced and its use more general. This isprimarily the responsibility of those who are affiliated with the threemovements which demonstrate the part I have sought to take in the worldpreparation. These are: The Arcane School, and this refers primarily to thebooks for which I am responsible; the Triangles, which constitutes a deeplyesoteric mode of working, yet one of extreme simplicity; and the Goodwillmovement, which has in it a factor of major importance in that this movement(embracing already as it does many, many thousands) seeks to promote right humanrelations with its acute and immediate appeal to the masses; it is this that themasses want essentially, and is oft what lies behind the things which they doand the plans which they make, so often ignorantly and disastrously.You will note that my outstanding theme is that of world planning; this is themain preoccupation of the Hierarchy. This planning falls into two categories,and for these the Christ is responsible. These are:1. The esoteric preparation for the physical appearance or the materialemergence of the Hierarchy on earth; with this activity the Buddha is definitelyassociated as it is connected with His final service to mankind.2. The establishing, by all means available, of right human relations; this, asit is achieved, will swing the Ashrams gradually into external activity as needarises, and it involves the constant cooperation of the Masters.[547] Since 1931 I have hinted at much of this, and my activities (carriedforward with these things in view) have followed the sequence outlined below:1. I attempted to reach certain people in order to see how far an ashram couldfunction in external form on earth. It has proved only a partial success and theresults of my experiment have been given in the book, Discipleship in the NewAge. The effects of the experiment upon the individuals involved have not provedencouraging; the effect upon the esotericists and aspirants of the world hasbeen most successful and has greatly enhanced the sense of reality, so essentialto the recognition of the hitherto unseen Hierarchy.2. I published books which gave the new esoteric teaching, founded on the past,of service today, and indicative of the future. In those books I isolated forthe new generation of esoteric students the “truths” which were true, extractingthem from the mass of imaginative thinking and consequent formulation ofthoughtforms which esotericists (since the time of H.P.B.) have so consistentlycreated and presented to the enquiring public as truths. I indicated the newtruths which were of significance for the future and for which the truths of thepast were a needed foundation, and gave enough in outline and in “seed” conceptsto show the lines along which the new world religion, the new political regimesand the new social order could be set up. I gave you the blueprints. Ienunciated these as principles, leaving men free—as must ever be the case—towork out the details according to their contributing civilisations and theirpeculiar national cultures, which should unitedly create a beautiful whole andnot provide barriers of separativeness as is today the case. I finally broughtto the attention of the public the idea that the externalisation of theHierarchy was a major hierarchical project, for which due preparation would haveto be made.3. The world war then reached a final stage; the first stage was from 1914-1918;it then proceeded in a subterranean [548] fashion, only to erupt once more in1939, continuing with extreme fierceness and cruelty till 1945, when the powerto continue the fight ended and the atomic bomb wrote finis to the world chapterof disaster. That atomic bomb (though used only twice destructively) ended theresistance of the powers of evil because its potency is predominantly etheric.Its uses are twofold at this time:a. As the forerunner of that release of energy which will change the mode ofhuman living and inaugurate the new age wherein we shall not have civilisationsand their emerging cultures but a world culture and an emerging civilisation,thus demonstrating the true synthesis which underlies humanity. The atomic bombemerged from a first ray Ashram, working in conjunction with a fifth ray group;from the long range point of view, its intent was and is purely beneficent.b. As a means in the hands of the United Nations to enforce the outer forms ofpeace, and thus give time for teaching on peace and on the growth of goodwill totake effect. The atomic bomb does not belong to the three nations who perfectedit and who own the secrets at present—the United States of America, GreatBritain and Canada. It belongs to the United Nations for use (or let us ratherhope, simply for threatened use) when aggressive action on the part of anynation rears its ugly head. It does not essentially matter whether thataggression is the gesture of any particular nation or group of nations orwhether it is generated by the political groups of any powerful religiousorganisation, such as the Church of Rome, who are as yet unable to leavepolitics alone and attend to the business for which all religions areresponsible—leading human beings closer to the God of Love.4. The world war now being ostensibly over and the work of restoration, leadingto resurrection, being slowly implemented, the work of the Hierarchy is tofoster that enthusiasm [549] in the hearts of people everywhere which willenable them to work wholeheartedly for right human relations and the spread ofthat simple but tonic quality, goodwill. It is enthusiasm in the spiritual sensewhich is lacking today, even among those who see the Mind of Christ and thePlans of the Hierarchy as existing in factual usefulness; those who have foryears read my teachings on goodwill with real belief in what I say but whoevidence no willingness to sacrifice time or money, block the growth of themovement. It is the task of the Hierarchy to promote goodwill as the first stepin Their plans, and it is that quality which is today closest to the heart ofChrist; “goodwill to men,” or rather among men, was the primary stage in thethreefold promise made by the angels at His Birth:a. Goodwill, leading to right human relations, leading tob. Peace on Earth, leading toc. Glory to God.Analysed, these words simply mean that goodwill will result in right humanrelations in that centre which we call Humanity ; this will produce thepossibility of that peace which characterises the Hierarchy appearing on earth,and leading to the glory of God, which animates the activity of Shamballa , thecentre where the Will of God is known. Therefore, intelligent relationship,practical love and the full expression of the divine will are bound to occur, ifthe correct sequence of activities is followed. At present, even the first ofthem remains a hope. The factors of the failure of the religious and politicalgroups and the apathy of the mass of men have greatly complicated the task ofthe Hierarchy.5. My personal work has been to bring all this to the attention of the generalpublic through my interpretation of the Problems of Humanity and bring it to thepoint where simplicity of purpose, an inspiring and flaming ardour and a minimumof organisation may implement the new presentation of goodwill as it affects andchanges the sovereign [550] world religions which are forgetful of the words ofthe Christ, “My kingdom is not of this world”; as it permeates into thepolitical conferences of world statesmen and rulers, and as it governs thedecisions of science and economics. In so doing and in the direful task ofpointing out mistakes and errors of ancient standing, wrong and disastrousattitudes and human separativeness, an inevitable opposition has been evoked;had there been none, my efforts would have been futile. I have said naught thatis not true and I retract no single word which I have said. There are many whoprefer the esoteric truths anent the antahkarana, the world constitution, thedoctrine of man, the Law of Rebirth and the many intricate teachings related toworld planning. These they have received in full measure from me. There areothers who desire information anent the Hierarchy, the work and standing of theMasters, the training to be given to disciples and initiates. This again theyhave received. I have now dealt in the past few years with world abuses and theproblems with which humanity is faced in this period of restoration—of God’splan for man, and not of former conditions.It is interesting to note that when the Hierarchy seeks to meet the need of themasses for better conditions, and to aid in the changing of ecclesiastical andpolitical abuses, men are apt then to withdraw their interest because the taskis hard, or to repudiate the statements anent that which is evil because (fromtheir point of view) it is not possible for the Hierarchy to find fault or takea stand against wrong, just as many repudiated the fact that the Hierarchy tookits stand, during the war, upon the side of the Forces fighting for the freedomof humanity and refused in any way to endorse those fighting on the side ofdarkness.The Hierarchy is a great fighting body today, fighting for the souls of men,fighting all that blocks the expansion of the human consciousness, fighting allthat limits human freedom (I said not license) and fighting to remove thosefactors and barriers which militate against the return of [551] the Christ andthe emergence of the Hierarchy as a fully functioning body on earth. There isnothing weak, vacillating, sentimental or neutral in the attitude of theHierarchy; this must be grasped by humanity, and the strength and insight aswell as the love of the Hierarchy must be counted upon.I have in the above remarks enumerated for you certain of the objectives facingthe Hierarchy at this time and involving the personal attention of the Christ;they all have a potent and beneficent effect upon humanity. Let me enumeratethem in concise form, because it is essential that there be clear perception ofthe emerging values on the part of workers of all grades and kinds in the world,for otherwise perception is not possible. To each point enumerated I will appendin a few brief words the reason why it is regarded as important:1. The Reorganisation of the World Religions.Reasonsa. To make way for the World Religion, universal religion.b. To return humanity to the simplicity which is in Christ.c. To rid the world of theology and ecclesiasticism.2. The Gradual Dissolution of Orthodox Judaism.Reasonsa. Because of its presentation of a wrathful Jehovah, caring only for his chosenpeople. This is a basic evil. The Lord of the World, the God in whom we live andmove and have our being, is totally otherwise.b. Because of its separativeness.c. Because it is so ancient that its teachings are largely obsolete.d. Because when the Jews become spiritual they will greatly benefit mankind, forthey are found in every land.3. Preparation for a New Revelation.Reasonsa. Because where there is no vision the people perish. [552]b. Because human expectancy indicates its emerging presence.c. Because the new Invocation will inevitably bring it to us.4. The Reaction of the Hierarchy to Shamballa.Reasonsa. Produces a direct channel.b. Conditions the inflow of power energy.c. Relates the will-to-good to goodwill.d. Creates new constructive tensions and new ashrams.5. A Closer Relation of the Hierarchy to Humanity.Reasonsa. Produces (in the near future) the externalisation of certain ashrams.b. Leads to the reappearance of the Hierarchy on earth.c. Recognises that man’s point of development warrants this.d. Presents a nearing opportunity for revelation.6. An Effort to avert War.Reasonsa. Because the next war would annihilate the greater part of the human race.b. Because, having a religious basis, the hate involved would be greater farthan anything hitherto known.c. Because Shamballa would be involved, and this has never been the case.You can see therefore how critical, spiritually, are these times, and how urgentis the task which confronts the Hierarchy and its workers on earth. The war maybe over in the physical sense, but great issues are still involved andundetermined and can lead either to peace or to a renewal of those conditions inwhich wars are generated and which, once generated, cannot be avoided.It is with all these foregoing factors in mind that we [553] approach the nexttwo great Festivals: the Wesak Festival and Christ’s Unique Occasion . One pointI must make here, and I make it with great joy: this year 1946 marks thebeginning of a cycle in which humanity is more closely involved in the Festivalsthan ever before and in which they can take a much more important part than everbefore. The Wesak Festival has long been kept in many countries and—as time goeson and the instruction of the masses proceeds—the meeting held at the time ofthe May Full Moon will assume great importance, but its keynote will be changed.What the new keynote will be has not yet been announced, and will not be for 35years. As I earlier pointed out, its significance, and that of Good Friday,belong to the past and their usefulness is nearly finished. It is the intentionof the Buddha and the Christ that in each country there should eventually besomeone who will act as Their Representative at the time of the two Festivals,so that the distribution of spiritual energy from the first great Aspect or Raywill be direct from the Buddha (and later Shamballa) to the Christ, and thenfrom the Christ to those disciples in every country who can be overshadowed, andso act as channels for the direct current of energy.The same procedure will be followed at the time of the Full Moon of June, exceptthat Shamballa will not be so involved, and with the difference that at the MayFestival it will be a first ray disciple who will be overshadowed, and at theJune Festival a second ray disciple will represent the Christ in every land.This can mean either the soul or the personality ray of the disciple.It has not been possible to organise this development this year, but next year abeginning can be made, even if only three or four countries can work under thisinspiration. The effects of this development will be far-reaching, though notimmediately apparent to the onlooker.This year, at the great Festival in the Himalayas at which the Buddha willappear as usual, He has let it be known that His main duty is to bring theinitial inflow of the threefold energy which the Invocation invokes and will[554] continue to invoke for many decades. From the Mind of God, Light will flowthrough Him to the waiting world of men—that human centre whose eternal missionis to bring light to all created lives. From the Heart of God, He will bring tothe Hierarchy, via the Christ, that deep unending inflow of Love which will makeit possible for the Hierarchy to perform its hard task and externalise itself.It is not possible for human beings to realise the sacrifice and the hardshipwhich this emergence will entail, and only a vast inflow of divine love can makeit possible.An effort also will be made to relate Shamballa, “the Centre where the Will ofGod is known,” directly to the New Group of World Servers, via those Ashramswhich are working along the lines of outer, practical goodwill. The reception ofthis energising will-to-good should produce a definite “stepping-up” or increaseof goodwill and enable the Goodwill movement to proceed with greater momentumthis coming autumn and winter; it will take the entire summer for the neededassimilation by those engineering this movement all over the world.The absorption of the Love which flows from the Heart of God to the Hierarchywill necessarily have widespread effects; however, one of the most immediatewill affect the Triangles and increase the potency of the network of light andof goodwill, already in existence. You can see, therefore, from all the above,how much closer the Buddha is coming this year to humanity. He now finds itpossible to permit human beings to know His specific objective; this has neverbefore been the case. It is the result of war and the efforts of the Hierarchyto bring out in the human being certain ennobling qualities and spiritualreactions which the stress of war could evoke. This year will mark a unique andpeculiar opportunity, based on the fact that there has not yet been time forpeople to slip back into the old ways of thinking or for the setting up of anyreactionary structures. This may not be the case next year and therefore itwould be wise to take as full advantage as possible of the coming Festivals.Those who have faith and vision are asked [555] to link up (imaginatively,because anything else would scarcely be possible) with the Buddha, then offerthemselves as channels for the spiritual potencies which He will bring.The Festival of June which is so uniquely Christ’s, and which emphasises Hisrelationship to humanity, in reality covers three whole days, each with adifferent keynote:1. The keynote of Love in its hierarchical sense—free from sentiment, emotionand personal emphasis—a love that sacrifices and understands, that acts withstrength and decision, and that works on behalf of the whole and not in theinterests of any group or individual.2. The keynote of Resurrection , emphasising the new note of livingness, of theliving Christ and of that “life more abundantly” which the war has made possibleby forcing a return to the real values.3. The keynote of Contact , of a closer relation between Christ and His people,between the Hierarchy and Humanity.The word “keynote” has been deliberately chosen and signifies the sound whichpreceded each major inflow at the May Festival; these energies will be releasedat a solemn ceremony on each of the three days. At each ceremony the Christ willsay the new Invocation alone, and then the united Hierarchy will intone thestanza alone, invoking light, love and the will-to-good (one on each of thethree days). Those disciples or initiates who happen to be interested andwatching the Triangles or the Goodwill movement will have them in their minds asthey say the first and third stanzas, and the New Group of World Servers willreceive some attention when the second stanza is chanted.I would call your attention, therefore, to the interest shown by the Hierarchyin the embryonic efforts in which you are engaged and which I started; I wouldpoint out, however, that the attention paid is not exclusive, but that [556]wherever two or three are gathered together in the name of the Master of theHierarchy, energy will flow; that wherever goodwill is a goal and evokes effortin no matter what form, the energy of the will-to-good will make itself felt,and that the New Group of World Servers is a far larger group than just the fewknown to you. Today its numbers are several million.The result of this solemn three days of invocation will be followed by aclimaxing day wherein the Hierarchy will unitedly, and led by the Christ,pronounce the entire Invocation, prefacing each stanza with its appropriatekeynote, again sounded in unison. These notes you cannot know, but if, forinstance, a very large number of the New Group of World Servers were broughttogether, their united OM might approximate the appropriate keynote.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that in the new cycle now beginning withthe climaxing of the war and the formation of the United Nations, the Festivalsof May and June not only become more closely linked, but the procedure has beenchanged and the effect on humanity intensified. I would have all who care tomeet together at these Festivals to try and do so subjectively (wherever theymay find themselves) and to participate intelligently in the ordainedceremonies. I would ask all to think imaginatively and to act as if they wereaccepted disciples or at least on the periphery of some ashram. I am asking youto take part in these two ceremonies with a full play of the imagination; theseceremonies will later be externalised at some centre in every country. A trainednucleus and a devoted band of believers is in process of being gathered together(though only as yet in the consciousness of the Hierarchy), and though at thepresent time there will be no outer ceremonies or any knowledge as to who willbe chosen in the various lands to represent the Hierarchy, in deed and in truth,the first step towards human participation is being made this year.The knowledge of this will give purpose and fixed intention to all of you whohave for years kept these [557] Festivals. In truth, I bring you the invitationof the Hierarchy to share in Their ancient work, and not—as in the past—to playthe part of interested onlookers. I would warn you that, if you do succeed inany measure of participation, it will be necessary to guard yourselves fromoverstimulation and to take steps wisely to use, on behalf of humanity, theenergy with which you may be charged.This knowledge will be particularly useful to those who are occupied with any ofthe groups and organisations which are responsive to hierarchical interests.True participation may lead to the sudden conviction of the reality of thatwhich I have told you; faith and belief and common-sense will then no longer beneeded, and you will know .I have here told you the things which the Christ has planned for the immediatefuture. I have told you also some of the things which He and the Masters must doas preparatory steps to the new world which can and will supersede the oldunhappy world that lies immediately behind us. I have chosen to speak to you ofthese activities in which it is now possible for you to share, with theexception of those which affect the relation between Shamballa and theHierarchy. However, those who are initiates of the third degree (and there arequite a few working on the earth among men at this time) can share in all ofthem.This is an intensely practical message and calls for your renewed pledge toserve humanity and to find your way into an Ashram where that service may bedirected. It calls for sacrifice until it hurts, and where it touches you themost; it calls for a joyous sense of unity with that station of power and lightwhich we call the Hierarchy and which stands ready—as never before—to share withhumanity that power and that light to the limit of human capacity to use it.I beg you, in closing, to aid in two matters which are of importance to Him Whomall disciples, initiates and spiritual men have loved and followed for nearlythree thousand years, the Christ. (I am referring here to His appearance as ShriKrishna and as one other who was little known [558] but who did a great work instill earlier centuries.) It is work in preparation for His coming.I beg you to shoulder the responsibility of distributing the Invocation on aslarge a scale as possible and in every country. It is of great potency, and whenused by men of all faiths can aid in the process of averting war. I ask you alsoto make possible the wide distribution of the book The Problems of Humanitywhich I have written, for they strengthen the hands of those who are alreadyseeking to deal with these problems and they bring the need to the attention ofthe unawakened. This will require sacrifice, for it calls for the expenditure ofmoney; even the Hierarchy works through normal channels and needs money, andeven the Christ has need of financial resources in order to reach the needy sonsof men. I ask your aid and I await your decision.That He Whom we serve may be nearer to all of us than ever before, that the workof establishing right human relations may proceed apace, and that light and lovemay stream forth from Shamballa and the Hierarchy over all of you who love yourfellowmen is the earnest wish, accompanied by my blessing, for you at thisseason of the will-to-good.**NOTE: “The Tibetan has asked me to make clear that when he is speaking of theChrist he is referring to His official name as Head of the Hierarchy. The Christworks for all men, irrespective of their faith; He does not belong to theChristian world that any more than to the Buddhist, the Mohammedan or any otherfaith. There is no need for any man to join the Christian Church in order to beaffiliated with Christ. The requirements are to love your fellowmen, lead adisciplined life, recognise the divinity in all faiths and all beings, and ruleyour daily life with Love.” A.A.BMode of Approach Toward Externalisation (August 1946)One of the most important things emerging from the theme of this amazing andimminent event (the reappearance of the Hierarchy on the physical plane) is thefactor of the developments and the adjustments going on within [559] theHierarchy Itself in preparation for this happening. Incidentally, I would herepoint out that what will take place, and what is already tentatively takingplace, is the externalisation of the Ashrams. The great official departments,such as the teaching department or that of emerging civilisations, will not atthis time reappear. Their activities will still, for a long time, be retainedwithin the Hierarchy upon Its own plane. The first step is the appearance ofcertain Ashrams, controlled by certain Masters, upon the physical plane, evokinggeneral recognition and guaranteeing to the public the fact of the Hierarchy andthe restoration of the Mysteries. Later, if these steps prove successful, otherand more important reappearances will be possible, beginning with the return ofthe Christ.But in the meantime, great and momentous happenings are taking place within theHierarchy and in relation to Its Membership. Disciples upon the periphery of anyAshram are apt to be unobservant of the training and attitudes of Those Who aresenior to them in an Ashram; They frequently overlook the fact that Theytoo—from the Christ down to the humblest initiate—are in process of steady andincreasing hierarchical discipline, training and instruction. Because the seniordisciples and initiates have reached a goal which has seemed for long quiteunattainable to the average aspirant, it is assumed that they have attained; thefact that they have only passed a milestone upon the endless Way of Bliss isentirely forgotten. But, owing to the impulsion of life itself, progress evercontinues; knowledge must ever be transmuted into wisdom; love must ever beaccompanied by divine will; planning must ever give way to divine purpose; lightmust ever be succeeded by life; from the Hierarchy, the initiate must pass toShamballa, and from Shamballa he will follow one or other of the seven Paths;the Path of Evolution gives place to the Way of the Higher Evolution; planetaryrecognitions eventually expand into solar contacts; the Christ-consciousnesseventually unfolds into something so all-inclusive that we have as yet no word[560] for it or any need of words; recognition of the Father and of monadicbeing causes all lesser recognitions to fade out, and soul-consciousness andprogressive life in form are no longer goals but are left far behind.In spite of all this, it is necessary to remember that the gain of allexperience for ever persists, nothing is ever lost; that which life in form hasconferred is still in the possession of the immortal spiritual entity; thatwhich the soul-consciousness has enfolded and included is still the richendowment of Being, centred now in the Monad; hierarchical experience is mergedinto the purposes of the Council Chamber at Shamballa, but ability to work inthe Hierarchy ever lasts because the hierarchical constitution and institutioncondition all manifestation—for what reason this is so, no one knows, but so isthe divine Will.In synthesis and in the all-inclusive awareness of the great Life which enfoldsall that is, everything (except what we know as evil) is persistent and for everendures.You will have noted (if you are true students of what I have given out to theworld) that information anent the Hierarchy has fallen into three majorcategories:1. The work of the Hierarchy in relation to man and to the three worlds of humanevolution.2. The interior constitution of the Hierarchy and its internal activity.3. Its superior relation to Shamballa and to extra-planetary livingness.A great deal that has been conveyed to you in the two final categories has beenmerged by you into an interested but totally impractical realisation that theHierarchy apparently has a life of its own which proceeds independently ofhumanity and that it also has its own goals and objectives which are no concernof yours. These deductions are dependent upon your domination by the separativemind, for in reality the work and the activity proceeding in all threecentres—Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity—are [561] merged, fused andinterdependent; they are all mutually evocative and invocative.The fact, for instance, that the Hierarchy is approaching closer to humanity andwill eventually make an appearance upon the physical plane is due, not only tohierarchical intent, but to the demand of mankind and to the strong vibrationand note which humanity has set up. To that extent, humanity controls some ofthe activities of the Hierarchy and thus precipitates action. At the same time,all that is happening can be traced to Shamballa, is inherent in divine purposeand is impulsed and impelled by Shamballa energy, distributed throughout theplanet, via the Hierarchy in the majority of cases. Both the Hierarchy andHumanity are brought under the influence of extra-planetary forces which maketheir impact upon the planet, via Shamballa. Therefore, a great interdependenceemerges, of which the head, heart and solar plexus centres in the individualman’s etheric body are symbols; their unified relation keeps the man functioningand demonstrating as a coherent whole at a particular level of consciousness. Itis essential that students endeavour to grasp this, and so develop withinthemselves at least the rudiments of this synthetic unified grasp of livingconditions and of a vital situation.These instructions can aid all earnest aspirants and disciples to develop thistype of understanding with as much speed and accuracy as possible. It isdistinctive of the hierarchical type of mind: concerned with itself as a divinegroup, conscious of the pull and evocative power of the highest centre,Shamballa, responsive to the demands of humanity, and sensitive to the “call” ofthat third major centre through which the life of the planetary Logos expressesitself. The consciousness of the Master is therefore preoccupied with three mainlines of responsibility, but only one of them is innate within the livingorganism of which He is a part; that aspect of His life is invocative in twodirections: towards Shamballa and towards Humanity; to Him, the other twocentres are evocative.Today, human beings as a whole are so loudly invocative [562] that the entiretrend of the life of the Hierarchy and Its plans to date have been subjected tochange, to postponement as far as certain interior and purely hierarchicaldeterminations are concerned, and to a hastening of certain plans which wereslated (if I may use such a word) to take place several centuries later thanthis but which—owing to the unexpected preparedness of humanity—can take place,not prematurely really, but securely and in the fullness of time; this fullnessof time, as regards the particular planning with which we are dealing, is fromnow until the year 2025 A.D.—a brief period of time indeed in which to see theconsummation of the larger purpose of the planetary Logos, working through thethree major centres within His body of manifestation. This purpose was threefoldin nature:1. It involved the ability of Those in the Council Chamber at Shamballa to reactto and absorb certain extra-planetary energies and to use them in anintra-planetary sense. It had not been anticipated by the Directing Agents ofthese forces that our planetary Logos would achieve a certain goal so early intime and space as He has.2. It involved a great expansion, numerically and in the consciousness of theHierarchy. This predicates a great influx of initiates and disciples and atremendous inflow of what is esoterically called “angelic essence” from the devakingdom, under the direction of certain great Devas who have affiliated duringthe past two hundred years with the Hierarchy. This again had not been expectedso early. The result of this happening has been that the door of initiationthrough which mankind passes stands wider open (symbolically speaking) than everbefore, and at the same time, the Masters are passing with greater rapidity onto the Way of the Higher Evolution; this is due to the fact that initiates arefitting themselves so rapidly to take Their places, and disciples are moving oninto initiate position so fast, that a great pressing forward has becomelegitimate.3. It involved, finally, a great awakening in the human family and a majorspiritual reorientation. This again had [563] been believed possible ofaccomplishment when the sun passed into Capricorn about 2300 years hence. But—ithas already taken place and necessarily has brought about a basic adjustment inthe plans of the Hierarchy and a renewed emphasis upon the purpose, asregistered in Shamballa.This, being factual, and the time ripe for decision, has caused anintra-planetary ferment and great activity in the three major centres. In thelast analysis (and this is the factor of supreme importance) thisdevelopment—this unexpected right absorption of spiritual energy, and thisseizing of spiritual opportunity—is due to humanity itself; above everythingelse, it is the readiness of mankind for that which is new, and humanity’sdetermination to create a new and better world, adapted more adequately to their“renewed” spiritual nature, that is responsible for all the activity.In this section of our training themes (if I may call them so) we shall dealprimarily with the response and the subsequent activity of the Hierarchy inrelation to humanity. This will take the form of a new Approach and areappearance exoterically.It would be wise, therefore, to keep the following ideas constantly in mind; Iwill enumerate them sequentially and for the sake of clarity:1. The work of the Hierarchy, throughout the ages, has been fundamentallythreefold in nature:a. A constant effort to set up a closer and more understanding relation withShamballa. This involves:An unfoldment of the will aspect in conjunction with a full use of intelligentlove.A constant adaptation of the developing Plan to the emerging, energisingPurpose.An increasing ability to transmit energy from Shamballa to the three worlds,from the cosmic etheric levels to the cosmic dense physical planes. [564]b. To unfold—within the periphery of the hierarchical centre—a life, a plan anda technique which will train all who find their way into an Ashram, which is initself an aspect of the life of the Hierarchy. This ancient and intelligenteffort has created and conditioned what you know as the Hierarchy. However, itis constantly subject to change in response to new situations and developments.c. To represent, finally, within the Hierarchy, the qualities of all the sevenRays, through the medium of the seven major Ashrams and their allied andsubsidiary Ashrams.There are many other aspects of the hierarchical constitution and objectives,but these three are the ones with which we are at this time the most concerned.2. Today, the relation of Shamballa to the Hierarchy is closer than at anyprevious time, owing to the following factors:a. The one-pointed work and plan—pursued by the three great departments in theHierarchy (the department of the Manu, that of the Christ, and that of the Lordof Civilisation)—in which the three Leaders have unitedly acted as a Triangle oftransmission between the Council Chamber of the Lord of the World and theHierarchy. They are, all three, Members of the Council, though none of Them isyet working at the very centre of affairs; in order to be of greater service inTheir own sphere, They have taken Their stand upon the periphery of theCouncil’s influence.b. The invocative work carried out both consciously and unconsciously byhumanity itself, which has been of such a potency that it has penetrated beyondthe ring-pass-not (symbolically understood) of the Hierarchy to Shamballaitself, and has evoked response. This invocative [565] work reached a high pointof potency as a result of the world war (1914-1945) and its note and appeal arestill persistent.c. The rapid development of integration among advanced people, which has forcedmany on to the Path of Discipleship, and therefore into certain of the Ashrams,and has likewise enabled many disciples to take initiation.3. The recognition by a very much larger number of the general public of thefact of the Hierarchy; this has established a new type of relation between theHierarchy and humanity. Hitherto the relation was dependent upon recognition, byadvanced aspirants, of the nature of their position in relation to theHierarchy; today, the recognition of thousands who are not in any way advancedaspirants or in any sense prepared for affiliation with the Hierarchy hascreated a new type of problem; it connotes to the Hierarchy a promisingdevelopment, though at the same time an embarrassing one, requiring as it does adifferent mode of adjustment to human demands than that entailed by theadmittance of disciples to Their Ashrams; it requires the attention of certaindisciples and initiates in all the Ashrams and the ability of the Hierarchy topenetrate and dissipate the thick cloud of inchoate thoughtforms which thebewildered, interested and curious public have created anent Them.4. The use by the Hierarchy of the destroyer aspect of divinity, the first Ray,in such a manner that it is in fact a creative factor and one which, in the lastanalysis, not only releases the life from its previous limitations, but alsocalls in—under the Law of Balance—the building activity of the second Ray. Thework of destruction is now practically accomplished and over, and the work ofthe Builders is beginning.5. The New Group of World Servers has been created as an [566] intermediate bodybetween the Hierarchy and the general public. This group is divided into twolesser groups:a. Those disciples and workers who are already integrated into some one of theAshrams.b. Intelligent and humanitarian aspirants and workers in world affairs and inall departments.These two groups unitedly form a transmitting agency through which the Hierarchycan reach the mass of men with the new concepts, the techniques of the newcivilisation and the basic propositions under which humanity will move forwardinto greater light.6. The recognition by humanity of its major problems, and the increasing abilityof the general public to view these problems in terms of One Humanity, of thewhole. This ability indicates to the Hierarchy the position of Humanity upon thePath at this time and the readiness of mankind for the new revelation—to befollowed later by the restoration of the Mysteries.7. The new orientation of the human family within itself to the concept of theOne Humanity and the intensely alert spiritual demand which is today distinctiveof mankind everywhere, and which has forced the Hierarchy to come to certainbasic decisions and to readjust Itself to a much closer cooperation with thehuman centre of life and purpose.It is interesting to note (though it is of no immediate moment) that the work ofdestruction initiated by the Hierarchy during the past one hundred andseventy-five years (therefore since the year 1775) has in it the seeds—as yet avery long way from any germination—of the final act of destruction which willtake place when the Hierarchy will be so completely fused and blended withHumanity that the hierarchical form will no longer be required. The three [567]major centres will then become the two, and the Hierarchy will disappear andonly Shamballa and Humanity will remain, only spirit or life, and substance asan expression of intelligent love will be left. This corresponds to theexperience of the individual initiate at the fourth initiation, when the causalbody, the soul body, disappears and only the monad and its expression, thepersonality (a fusion of soul and form) are left. This event of finaldissolution will take place only at the close of our planetary existence, whenthe door to individualisation is finally closed for a pralayic period and theWay of the Higher Evolution will be more closely trodden than the Path ofInitiation.Therefore, my brothers, the closer relation of the Hierarchy to Shamballa, thestimulation of its own interior life, and the readiness of humanity forrevelation and for certain unexpected development, will condition the cycle intowhich we are now entering. This is, therefore, the most amazing period in thehistory of humanity. Added to this, it must be borne in mind that we areentering another greater round of the Zodiac, and this coincides with the lesserzodiacal activity because Aquarius governs the greater immediate cycle of 25,000years and is also the sign into which the sun is now moving for a period of 2300years—a most amazing happening and full of import in our planetary history; itis a coincidence of which our planetary Logos is well aware and of which He ismaking full and intelligent use. It is a cycle also wherein, for the first time,the three major planetary centres—Shamballa, Hierarchy and Humanity—are indirect and unimpeded relation, for today the alignment is correct and adjustedfor the first time in planetary history. Even if this be only temporarily so,something has been initiated, the effects of which will never be lost. It is acycle also in which the planetary Logos, having successfully taken initiationand thus affected His entire planetary life, has also established certainextra-planetary relationships which are necessarily incomprehensible to you andof no moment whatsoever to the individual human being, but which will eventuallycreate a situation in which our planet will become [568] a sacred planet. Thisprocess, as it unfolds and develops, will have a potent subjective and deeplyspiritual effect upon every kingdom in nature and in the realm also ofsupernature.Let us now proceed with our consideration of our theme, after our study of thesebasic premises.Steps in the Externalisation ProcessFor some time, ever since 1425 A.D., ( a date to which I referred earlier) theHierarchy has been aware that the time would come when this projected move wouldtake place. Preparations have gone steadily forward. A point to be remembered isthat this impulsed intention (emanating in the first place from Shamballa) cameas a major disturbance to the rhythm of many tens of thousands of years; it hasbeen a basic conditioning factor. The Masters, however, Who will make the moveoutwards into contact with the world are not the Ones Who registered the initialimpulse from Shamballa, nor are the three Heads of the great departments thesame. The earlier Masters initiated the needed steps of preparation, and thework has gone steadily forward since.You might well ask what were these steps and along what lines has thepreparation gone? The first steps concerned internal preparation. Though theMasters of the Wisdom have all passed through the human experience and aresimply men who have achieved a relative measure of perfection, there are aspectsof physical contact which They have completely transcended and utterly negated.There is nothing in the three worlds with which They have any affinity, exceptthe affinity of life and the impulse of love for all beings. Recovery of certainfacilities of activity has been deemed necessary. For instance, the five senses,where a Master is concerned, exist and are used at need, but the contactestablished and maintained with disciples and senior aspirants in the world(through whom They primarily work) is largely telepathic; hearing and sight, asyou understand [569] their uses, are not involved. The science of impression,with its greatly increased effectiveness over individual contact through thesenses, has entirely superseded the more strictly human method. Except in thecase of Masters working on the physical plane and in a physical body, the outerphysical senses are in abeyance; for the majority of Masters Who still use thesesenses, the use is strictly limited; Their work is still almost entirelysubjective and the mode of telepathic interplay and of impression is practicallyall the means which They employ to reach Their working agents. Therefore, therecovery of past usages of a more physical nature has been one of thepreparatory moves.Another has been the achievement of a wide culture and understanding of thecurrent civilisation which will be coming into activity and control when theintended project is carried out. You have been told—and told correctly—that theMasters do not trouble Themselves to attain proficiency in all educationalsubjects—in modern history, for instance, or the newest scientific procedures,or in the use of foreign languages. In all Their Ashrams there are those who cansupply Them with any specified knowledge which They may need at any given timeor for any specific purpose. This will still remain true of Those Who haveattained the rank of Master, but it is not true of all the senior initiates,many of whom, as they passed into higher grades and under instruction from aMaster, have retained their worldly knowledge, besides specialising in certainstrictly mundane approaches to worldly affairs. For instance, there are adeptswho are authorities upon modern financial matters, and these initiates of thefourth degree are competently preparing to institute later those newertechniques and modes of financial interplay which will supersede the presentdisastrous methods; they will inaugurate a system of barter and exchange, ofwhich modern money is the travestied symbol. This newer method of financialrelationships will be comprehensively human and it will supersede big businessand private enterprise. It will at the same time, however, retain those phasesof modern enterprise which will draw out the initiative and [570] theresourcefulness of the individual. Other initiates have specialised in thevarious languages, and two of them are authorities in basic English; this is theform of the English language which will eventually take the place of otherlanguages in all forms of international and business intercourse without in anyway obliterating the individual national languages in daily use in any country.Two things must be realised as the interested student considers this event ofexternalisation:1. The senior Members of the Hierarchy will not at first be the ones who willmake the needed approach. Under Their direction and Their close supervision,this approach will be made—in the early stages—by initiates of and under thedegree of the third initiation, and also by those disciples who will be chosenand designated to implement Their efforts and so will work under Theirdirection. It is only in the later stages, and when the time has come for thereturn into recognised physical expression of the Christ, leading to thedefinite restoration of the Mysteries, that certain of the senior Members of theHierarchy will appear and take outer and recognisable physical control of worldaffairs. The time for this will be dependent necessarily upon the success of thesteps taken by the members of the Hierarchy who are not so advanced.2. Members of the Hierarchy, whether working in the early stages or later whenthe true externalisation takes place, will work as members of the human familyand not as proclaimed members of the kingdom of God or of souls, known to us asthe Hierarchy; they will appear in office of some kind or another; they will bethe current politicians, business men, financiers, religious teachers orchurchmen; they will be scientists and philosophers, college professors andeducators; they will be the mayors of cities and the custodians of all publicethical movements. The spiritual forcefulness of their lives, their clear, purewisdom, the sanity and the modern acceptableness of their proposed measures inany department in which they choose to function, will be so [571] convincingthat little impediment will be set in the way of their undertakings.At the present stage of preparation, the task of the disciple who is chargedwith laying the foundation for the New Age methods and with the labour ofgetting ready for the first group of Ashram members, is hard indeed. He standsfor so much that is deemed visionary and impossible; the difficulties whichconfront him seem impossible; he teaches truths whose first effect isnecessarily destructive, because he endeavours to rid humanity of old forms ofreligious, economic and political doctrine; his impersonality—which recognisesfaults as well as virtues—enrages many and often those from whom he had expectedunderstanding and a true impartiality; his failure to be impressed or attentiveto old rites and ceremonies, to ancient and obsolete but precious ideas, and hisconstant warfare on conditioning glamours and illusions meet, in these earlystages, with little encouragement. He works frequently alone and usually withlittle recognition and lacks time for his own personal hierarchical contacts; heis not necessarily connected with any so-called esoteric groups and—if he is—histask is that much harder; only advanced disciples with a full and consciousconstant contact with their particular Ashram are able to work in this way.Occult bodies and esoteric groups are, at this time, the most glamoured of anyof the world groups; the work of any disciple in such groups is bound, in theearly stages, to be destructive. The present occult groups which came intoexistence prior to 1919 will eventually all disappear; the members who are trueand sound, broad-minded and sane, and rightly oriented and dedicated, will findtheir way into esoteric bodies which are free from dogmatism and doctrines andwhich are recipients of hierarchical life.The preparatory work of externalisation, therefore, falls into three phases orstages, as far as relation to mankind is concerned:First . The present stage in which a few isolated disciples and initiates,scattered all over the world, are doing [572] the important task of destruction,plus the enunciation of principles. They are preparing the way for the firstorganised body of disciples and initiates who—coming from certain Ashrams—willproceed with the next phase of the work.Second . The stage of the first real externalisation upon a large and organisedscale will succeed upon the above endeavours. These disciples and initiates willbe the real Builders of the new world, of the new civilisation; they will assumeleadership in most countries and take high office in all departments of humanlife. This they will do by the free choice of the people and by virtue of theiradvanced and proven merit. By this means, gradually the Hierarchy will take overthe control upon the physical plane—subjectively as well as objectively—of thedirection of human affairs. This direction will be in virtue of their known andapproved capacity and will not involve the imposition of any hierarchicalcontrol or authority; it will simply signify the free recognition by free peopleof certain spiritual qualities and effective activities which they believesignify that these men are adequate to the demanded job, and whom they thereforechoose as directing agents in the new and coming world. Freedom of choice underthe authority of a spiritual livingness which demonstrates competency will bedistinctive of the attitude of the general public. Men will be put into highoffice and into positions of power not because they are disciples or initiates,but because they are wise and intelligent servants of the public, with aninternal awareness, a deeply religious and inclusive consciousness, and awell-trained mind with an obedient brain.This stage of hierarchical appearance is dependent upon the effective service ofthe first group of isolated and hard-working disciples who are the seniormembers of the New Group of World Servers and who are today working among thesons of men. This second group will take over from them, and theirs will be thetask of instituting a more unified preparation for the return of the Christ. Thefirst group prepare humanity for the possibility; the second group [573]definitely prepare for the return itself. They will build for a future whichwill arise out of the wreckage of the past, which wreckage they will remove;they will instill certain basic concepts anent right human relations into men’sminds. Their immediate group work, when they are coming into power andrecognition, will consist of a sweetening and a clarification of the politicalsituation and the presentation of those ideas which will eventually lead to afusion of those principles which govern a democracy and which also condition thehierarchical method—which is somewhat different; this effort will produce athird political situation which will not be entirely dependent upon the choicesof an unintelligent public or on the control which the hierarchical techniqueevidently involves. The mode of this new type of political guidance will laterappear.This second group will implement the new religion; by the time they come intocontrol the old theological activities will have been completely broken; Judaismwill be fast disappearing; Buddhism will be spreading and becoming increasinglydogmatic; Christianity will be in a state of chaotic divisions and upheavals.When this takes place and the situation is acute enough, the Master Jesus willtake certain initial steps towards reassuming control of His Church; the Buddhawill send two trained disciples to reform Buddhism; other steps will also betaken in this department of religions and of education, over which the Christrules, and He will move to restore the ancient spiritual landmarks, to eliminatethat which is nonessential, and to reorganise the entire religious field—againin preparation for the restoration of the Mysteries. These Mysteries, whenrestored, will unify all faiths.Groups of spiritually-minded financiers who are conscious members of an Ashramwill take hold of the world economic situation and bring about great and neededchanges. All these activities, built upon the preparatory work of the firstgroup, are also preparatory in nature.Third . The stage wherein Christ and the Masters of [574] the Wisdom can makepublic appearance and begin to work publicly, openly and outwardly in the worldof men. The time of Their coming will be dependent upon the success of the workundertaken by the first two groups; it is not possible for me to prophesy anentthis matter. So many factors are involved: the earnest work of the two groups,the readiness and the willingness of mankind to learn, the rapidity with whichthe forces of restoration and of resurrection can rehabilitate the world, theresponsiveness of advanced humanitarians and intelligentsia to the opportunityto rebuild, to recreate and to reorganise the factors which the new culture andthe new civilisation will demand. Even the Hierarchy Itself, with all Itssources of information, does not know how long this will take, but They areready to move at any time.In the meantime, as the first group struggles with the immediate problem in theouter world, and the second group—still within the confines of the HierarchyItself—makes due interior preparation and applies to its chosen membership theneeded training and the desired reorientation, the Christ and the Masters areoccupied with the task of preparing for the restoration of the Mysteries. Thisrestoration will fall into three phases and will cover and include in itssymbolism all phases of human unfoldment. The story of mankind will bepictorialised. These three phases correspond broadly and in a general sense tothe three degrees of the Blue Lodge in Masonry. The analogy is not entirelyaccurate, owing to the unavoidable degeneracy of Masonry, but with therestoration of the Mysteries, Masonry also will come into its own. These phasesare:1. The stage of a general recognition of light in all departments of humanliving. This is inferred in the first stanza of the new Invocation. If theritual of the E.A. is studied in the light of this information the significancewill emerge. The poor and destitute candidate emerges into the light.2. The stage of complete economic reorientation; in this, humanity is relievedof all economic anxiety and is free to [575] receive its due wages and the rightreward of all service rendered in the building of the Temple of the Lord; thisbuilding proceeds with rapidity.3. The stage wherein the reward of light is received and the reward of servicerendered; spiritual status is recognised through the medium of what is regardedas a major initiation, for which the first two initiatory degrees are onlypreparatory. This first great initiation will be objectively staged and thegeneral public will recognise it as the major rite and ritual of the newreligious institution of the period. This is the stage where the forces ofresurrection are active, when the Lord is with His people and Christ hasreturned to earth. Religion is then recognised as an attitude governing allphases of human experience.Approach, via Certain AshramsStudents must not proceed on the assumption that in the process ofexternalisation there is a general moving forward of the entire Hierarchy ontothe physical plane. Such is not the case. The whole effort is as yet (and willbe for some time) experimental, and only a few of the Ashrams and a certainnumber of the trained disciples and initiates will be involved at first. Itstill remains to be proved how ready humanity is for this attempt. The Christianconcept of the return of a triumphant Christ, coming in the clouds of heaven toJerusalem, there to reign for a thousand years, is true in one way and utterlyfalse as to design, location and method. Christ will return; the Jerusalemreferred to (literally “the place of peace”) is not the chief city of a smallcountry called Palestine or the Holy Land; the word is simply symbolic of apeaceful world—a world which, through its own self-initiated efforts, hasattained a general quietude and has acquired a certain measure of right humanrelations. His coming in the air might be interpreted literally to mean that atthe right time He will come by plane from the place on earth where He has beenfor many generations, watching over the sons of men; the words “every [576] eyeshall see Him” might mean that, by the time He comes, television will have beenperfected and He will then be seen, by its means, from even the most distantspot on earth. To the orthodox Christian, the above will sound like the rankestblasphemy, but the question immediately arises: Why should it be blasphemy forHim to use modern methods? Whilst on earth before, He conformed to the customsof His time. “Riding on the clouds of Heaven” may sound more picturesque andapparently require a greater expression of divinity, but why use such a meanswhen a plane will equally well fulfil the purpose and carry the prophecy tocompletion? A great deal of reactionary stupidity will have to be eliminatedbefore He can come, and it will be as the new generation assert their hold overhuman thinking. But it is not the event or the stage of Christ’s appearing withwhich we are now dealing, but with the preparatory stages and with the task offitting the world (which means, in this case, preparing the human consciousness)for the presence in physical activity and manifestation of the Hierarchy—in fullforce and with its esoteric equipment.In the early stages, the task of preparation is arduous and difficult. Thingswill be relatively easy for the senior Members of the Hierarchy when They findthe right time for Their appearance. In the meantime, the world disciples haveto take the world—as it is at this time—and slowly and laboriously instill thenew ideas, incite to better methods of human relations, help dissipate theaftermath of war, hold before the eyes of distraught humanity the new vision ofhope and of spiritual enlightenment, offset the scheming of reactionary andconservative politicians and churchmen, and teach the youth of the age the newmodes of living, indicating to them the better values, and thus slowly andgradually bringing in the new order.Among the seven major Ashrams and their subsidiary and affiliated Ashrams only afew have undertaken to send their disciples and their initiates at this time tocarry out this initiatory task. The three major Ashrams so engaged are: [577]1. The Ashram of the Master K.H. This is the second ray Ashram and—with that ofthe Master M.—the most powerful in the Hierarchy; it controls the buildingforces.2. The first ray Ashram, that of the Master M. He is the custodian of theprinciple of synthesis, the work of which is that of organic fusion, and this isever needed to supplement that of the building agents.3. The Ashram of a Master on the fifth ray, the custodian, among other things,of science and of that which relates and brings into expression the duality ofspirit-matter. This Ashram has an important part to play in the work ofpreparation, for it is through the scientific use of energy that the world willbe rebuilt and the factual nature of the Hierarchy be proved.Through the pressure of education (second ray energy), through the growth of theconcept of synthesis (first ray energy), and through the correct use of energy(fifth ray energy), this world can be brought into a condition of preparednessfor the externalisation of the Hierarchy.The efforts of the disciples coming from the Ashram of K.H. will be largelydirected towards the general public, but they will work primarily througheducators in all countries and through those concerned with the teaching ofreligion. Educators touch those preparing for all types of activity. The taskwill be necessarily slow, particularly at first, but the second ray endowment ofthese disciples (as that of all disciples on this ray) is a steady persistencewhich brooks no discouragement, even when discouragement makes its appearance.Such disciples refuse to discontinue their effort or to change thespiritually-ordained plans, even when the obstacles to accomplishment seeminsuperable. Disciples will come deliberately into incarnation and will takeoffice in institutions of higher learning and in the churches, and will exertsuch pressure that old and obsolete methods, ancient outworn theologies andselfish and competitive techniques [578] will be ended and the sciences ofcooperation, of right human relations and of correct adjustment to life throughmeditation and right vision will supersede the present methods of learning; thiswill lead to no damage to the acquisition of academic knowledge or the rightapprehension of spiritual truth. The vision will be different and the goals of ahigher order, but the best that is now taught along the lines of art, religionand science will still be available; they will, however, be presented with agreater enlightenment and a better emphasis. They will meet the people’s need.The churches, being today headed towards failure and lacking vision, willeventually and inevitably crash upon the rocks of unwarranted and abusedauthority, yet out of the wreckage will emerge those true and spirituallyenlightened churchmen who—with vision and sure knowledge, free from dogmatismand hating ecclesiastical authority—will develop the new world religion.Paralleling these activities (and disciples on this ray are already taking theneeded steps) will come that of the disciples and initiates who are workingunder the direction of the Master M. Their work lies in the field of right humanrelations and in the production of that synthesis of effort which will create anew intuitional consciousness and—consequently—a changing politicalconsciousness and situation in which the family of nations will stand togetherfor certain basic values. These are fundamentally three in number:1. The freedom of the individual. These freedoms have been voiced for us in thewords of that great first ray disciple, Franklin D. Roosevelt. They are the fouressential freedoms.2. Right international interplay, necessitating finally the abolition of war.3. Clean political regimes, free from graft, selfish ambition and dirtypolitical manoeuvring.In the achievement of these ends (and only major issues will be considered,leaving the lesser and unimportant effects [579] to be dealt with later) thedisciples of synthesis and the instigators of right political relationships willwork in close cooperation with disciples upon the second ray whose task it is toeducate the general public in the truer values. A trained and enlightenedpublic, shouldering right responsibility, will elect only those men whose visionis in line with the new ethics, the new science of right human relations, andwho recognise as a basic political tenet the equality of all men—an equalityfounded on a universal and basic divinity.Allied to the efforts of these two groups of disciples and initiates will bethose disciples on the fifth ray, whose task it will be to lead mankind into thebenefits of the atomic age. The occultist has ever proclaimed that the fieldwherein the Hierarchy works is that of energy; they have taught that there isnothing in existence but energy in some form or other, and that all we see, allwith which we daily work (including our own material natures, mental, emotionaland physical), and all that produces phenomena is energy in relation to forces,or forces as they are directed by energy.This the emerging group of disciples will incontrovertibly prove; by theirefforts the new civilisation will be created, in which humanity will have timefor freedom, for the deeper educational considerations and for a politicalactivity of the spiritual kind; science will produce a world wherein labour (aswe now know it) will be abolished and every phase of man’s life will beimplemented by science—not in order to make him more comfortable or more like arobot or more selfish, but as an aspect and outgrowth of true freedom; men willbe free to think, to establish new modes of cultural interests, and free also tounfold the higher abstract mind and to interpret its conclusions through themedium of the trained lower concrete mind.The united work of these three groups of disciples and initiates prepares theway for the externalisation of the Hierarchy; this preparation is already underway and taking definite form, though as yet the efforts are embryonic and theworkers very few in numbers. A beginning has nevertheless [580] been made andgreat changes will take place during the next twenty-five years; these willindicate the general structure of the new world of culture, will emphasise asnormal the higher concepts of the so-called “visionary” world planner and laythe foundation for the work of the other Ashrams, when the time for an expandedeffort arrives.When the three major Ashrams have done their work, and this work—in spite of thedifference of ray—is largely educational, then the other Ashrams will slowlysend in their representatives to cooperate and to continue with the task. Thefirst Ashram to do so will be that of the third ray; by the time disciplesappear from that Ashram the world will be ready for an all-over financialadjustment; the “principle of sharing” will be a recognised motivating conceptof the new civilisation. This will not involve beautiful, sweet and humanitarianattitudes. The world will still be full of selfish and self-seeking people, butpublic opinion will be such that certain fundamental ideals will motivatebusiness, being forced upon business by public opinion; the fact that the newgeneral ideas will in many cases be governed by the expediency of interplay willnot basically matter. It is the sharing that is of importance. When the“adjuster of finances” (as an advanced disciple from this Ashram is called inthe Hierarchy) appears, he will find conditions greatly changed from those nowprevalent, and this to the following extent:1. The principle of barter and of exchange (to the benefit of all concerned)will control.2. Owing to the development of atomic energy on behalf of human welfare,national currencies will have been largely superseded, not only by a system ofbarter but by a universal monetary exchange—representative of the bartered goodswhen they are relatively small and unimportant—and by a planned scale of relatedvalues. National material assets and the needed commodities will all be providedfor under an entirely new system.3. Private enterprise will still exist, but will be regulated; the great publicutilities, the major material [581] resources and the sources of planetarywealth—iron, steel, oil and wheat, for instance—will be owned in the first placeby a governing, controlling international group; they will, however, be preparedfor international consumption by national groups chosen by the people and underinternational direction.Upon this subject I have no time to give, and besides this, anything I could saywould be regarded as visionary and impractical in a world which has not yet beensubjected to the educational processes of the disciples and initiates on thefirst, second and fifth rays or to the fundamental changes which the newgeneration of young people (now growing up) will shortly inaugurate.Upon this threefold condition of the basic control of the products of theplanet, these third ray disciples, working under the senior initiates abovementioned, will build the new structure of material relationships—a mostdifficult task, owing to the evil “pull” of the substantial assets and thecontinued control, even though greatly lessened, of human selfishness. This“pull” is regarded esoterically as evil because it embodies the principle ofimprisonment and has, for untold aeons, engrossed the attention of the humanbeing, to the exclusion of all true values.Later, disciples and initiates of the seventh ray and of the sixth ray will comeinto physical incarnation. The only Ashram which will be then unrepresented—andthis for a long time—will be the fourth. As the fourth ray is, however, theconstant ray of the human family, its influence is consistently present, andthis Ashram is equally constantly aware of and influential in human affairs; itwill come into full expression when the intuition of the human being, emanatingas an energy from the fourth or buddhic plane, has been evoked by the human souland is a recognised asset in human consciousness. The fourth ray will come intomanifestation before many generations have passed, but only from the angle ofits incarnating Monad, and not from the angle of its active Ashram.[582] Once the contact—in physical manifestation and physical recognition—hasbeen established, a system of “appearances and of abstractions” will beinstituted by the Hierarchy, producing what might be regarded as a circulationof its life and representatives between the two major planetary centres, theHierarchy and Humanity. According to the need upon the physical planet, and uponthe acceptance of certain designs, will an Ashram be prominently active orrelatively inactive.The ancient activities of the Hierarchy will still persist—the activities ofpreparing disciples and initiates for initiation and for participatingconsciously in hierarchical effort; the Schools of the Mysteries (as outlined byme in Letters on Occult Meditation ) will come into being and practice, but thiswill be temporarily a secondary activity; the full expression of ashramic energywill be directed to practical world affairs and to the education of the generalpublic, and not in the early stages to esoteric matters. In the last analysis,there is for the Master and His disciples no such thing as esotericism, exceptin so far as Shamballa is concerned. There is only definite and planned workwith the consciousness of all forms, and—where humanity is involved—this isregarded as a process of education, leading to an expansion of perception andthe changing of acquired academic knowledge into an overshadowing andconditioning wisdom. The implementing of human affairs to bring about thisunfoldment in consciousness is in the hands of disciples who are undergoing theprocess themselves, and it is not in the hands of the Masters, Whoseconsciousness is fully expanded—a consciousness entering a higher and greatlydifferent phase, connected with Being and Life and the purposes of Shamballa.Approach Towards Externalisation in the Disciple’s ConsciousnessI find it necessary here to make one point clear. The disciples sent out fromthe various ashrams do not arrive on earth conscious of a high mission orknowing well the nature of the task to which they have been subjectivelyassigned. In [583] the case of certain disciples who will be of special worldprominence and who are of initiate rank, they may attain to a conviction ofmission (if I may call it so) in their extreme youth and thus be orientedtowards their life task from the very start; that conviction will grow anddeepen and clarify as the years go by. But it must be remembered that themajority of disciples will not so react. They will come into incarnation withcertain gifts and innate talents and with certain firmly rooted ideas, endowedwith irrevocable ideals and a brain which is responsive to a well-developedmind. They will, normally and through natural trends and predilections, findtheir way into that field of human activity wherein they are intended to workand in which they are to bring about certain basic changes in line withhierarchical intent. This hierarchical intent will usually be unknown to them(though this may not always be the case), but the work to be done will seem tothem impelling and necessary and something which they must do at all costs. Theywill find their way into politics, into the educational movements and intoscience; they will work as humanitarians, as social workers and in the field offinance, but they will follow these lines of activity through naturalinclination and not because they are being “obedient” to instruction from someMaster. They will be successful in their endeavour because the potency of theHierarchy will be behind them, and there is much that the inner Ashram canaccomplish for its outer working disciples in the way of opening doors,implementing efforts and arranging contacts, and other facilities; this is illdone, however, without any evidence of the inner impulsion. Recognition of theinner effort will be dependent upon the status in the Ashram of the disciple.When the disciple is a very advanced one, he may become aware of his highmission and know it to be no fanatical and self-initiated intention, but adefinite task undertaken in response to ashramic planning. Such cases willusually be the exception and not the rule, particularly in the early stages.Such hierarchical workers will gather around them lesser disciples who will workalong the same lines, through community of interest but not [584] throughrecognition of similar instructions—a very different thing. In the one case, theconsciousness of mission is developed through periods of definite planning withthe Ashram and in consultation with the Master or His senior workers. In themore usual case, the disciple re-acts and works in response to impression, beingat this stage totally unaware from whence the impression comes; he regards it asan activity of his own mind acting as a directing agent in all the plannedactivities, the life theme and purpose which are his service dynamic.One major characteristic is, however, present in all these working disciples andaspirants; this is a wide humanitarianism and a determination to aid in thecause of human welfare. One interesting distinction will later emerge andcondition the new age in contradistinction to past and present methods.Disciples and aspirants will not be dedicated to purely humanitarian and welfarework. That will be a motive and not an objective in work. They will not give uptheir days and efforts solely to the relief of human necessity. All phases ofhuman living—politics, finance and science, as well as religion—will berecognised to be their immediate and spectacular task, but the motivation in thefuture will not be primarily business success or personality ambition but theimpulse to subordinate these to the general effort and to aid humanity as awhole, with a long range vision.It is this growing spirit of humanitarianism which will lie behind all movementstowards world socialisation in the various nations. This movement is symptomaticof a change in the orientation of man’s thinking, and therein lies its majorvalue. It is not indicative of a new technique of government in reality, andthis particular phase of it is ephemeral; it is at the same time foundational tothe new world order which will emerge out of all these experiments which humanthinking is at this time evolving.These are the things which will be in the consciousness of disciplescommissioned by the Hierarchy to bring about the needed changes and the neworientation, and not any [585] recognition of Masters and Their orders or of anyhierarchical and ashramic background.Whilst in incarnation such disciples stand free to serve one-pointedly andwholeheartedly that section or phase of human effort in which their lot andlife-trend appear to cast them. They may be quite unconscious of any spiritualobjective (so-called today) except the recognition that they love theirfellowmen; this love will condition all they do and will motivate their everyeffort.From the standpoint of the Master, they can be reached, impressed and directed,and most definitely they are so reached; from their own standpoint they aresimply busy, energetic people, gifted with a good mind, profoundly interested intheir chosen life task and proving themselves capable of effective work alongsome particular line, able to influence and direct others in similar activityand definitely bringing about changes in the branch of human endeavour withwhich they are concerned, thus lifting underlying principles on to higherlevels. This is straight hierarchical work. It affects on broad lines theconsciousness of humanity.These disciples may be conscious that their effort and their thinking are partof a forward-moving evolutionary endeavour; to that extent they aremission-conscious, but the value of this attitude is that it relates them, inconsciousness, to many others, similarly motivated and conscious of a similarvision. It is of course wise to remember that all such disciples are pronouncedray types and are integrated personalities in the highest sense of the word.They will work on earth as high grade personalities, under the impact of strongmotives which emanate from the soul in response to impression from the Ashram,but of this, in their physical brains, they know nothing and care less. Part oftheir effectiveness in service is due to the fact that they are not preoccupiedwith soul contact and with the idea of academic service. Their eyes are on thejob to be done, their hearts are with their fellowmen, and their heads are busywith methods, techniques and practices which will raise the entire [586] levelof endeavour in their chosen field. Hence their inevitable success.Disciples who are intensely interested in personal responsiveness to the soul,who work diligently at the problem of soul contact, who are busy with the art ofserving consciously and who make service a goal, who are keenly alive to thefact of the Ashram and to the Master, will not be asked to do this work ofpreparing for the externalisation of the Hierarchy. Advanced disciples who arestabilised in the Ashram, and who are so used to the Master that He assumes intheir consciousness no undue prominence, can be trusted to work along rightlines in the world and do the work of preparation. They cannot be sidetracked ordeflected from one-pointed attention to the task in hand by any soul call orurge; hence they are free to do the intended work.The situation, therefore, in relation to the consciousness of disciples in theintensely difficult, though interesting, period with which humanity is facedcould be summed up in the following statements:1. The disciple is not motivated by any desire to externalise the Hierarchy orto see the Ashram with which he is affiliated functioning physically on theouter plane. He may be totally unaware of this hierarchical intention. If he isaware of this underlying purpose, it is entirely secondary in his consciousness.The good of humanity and a stabilised spiritual future for mankind are his majorlife incentives.2. The disciple is strictly humanitarian in his outlook. He works for the OneHumanity and though aware possibly that he is affiliated with the Hierarchy, hisloyalties, his service and his life intention are directed entirely to the causeof human betterment. In this attitude he is coming to resemble the Masters Whoselife directive is not hierarchical possibilities but adherence to the purposesof Shamballa, in action, in relationships and to the Plan for all living unitsin the three worlds.3. The intuition of the disciple is alert and active; the new ideas and thevital fresh concepts are foremost in his mind. [587] He almost automaticallyrepudiates the reactionary and conservative thinking of the past and—withoutfanaticism and undue emphasis—he lives, talks and instructs along the new linesof right human relations.4. The disciple, occupied with hierarchical plans for the future, has acompletely open mind as regards the growth of true psychic powers. He deploresand represses all negative conditions and forms of thinking as he contacts themin his environment, but he encourages the growth of all forms of higher sensoryperception which expand the human consciousness and enrich its content.5. According to his hierarchical status, he will become increasingly a channelof power in the world. His own ashramic life will deepen as his world servicedevelops. The statement in the Bible (or rather injunction) to “take rootdownward and bear fruit upward” has for him a deeply occult significance.I am not here touching upon the growth of a disciple as a disciple, or on hisindividual progress on the Path; I am considering the type of consciousness withwhich he faces the task which confronts him. Unless he fulfils within himselfthe requirements enumerated in this section of our study, he will not be one ofthe workers in this interlude between the old age and the new.The Dissemination of Information of a Preparatory NatureThose who do the work of reaching humanity with the needed information fall intotwo main groups:1. Disciples and convinced aspirants who are today working in the field ofoccultism.2. Those disciples and initiates who will emerge from the three Ashrams andwhose work is largely to act as the vanguard of the Hierarchy and precede itinto outer manifestation. This will begin in the year 1975, if the disciples nowactive will do their work adequately.[588] Much has already been done in familiarising the general public with theconcept of the Hierarchy. Much of it has been done in such a manner as to bringthe whole subject into disrepute, as well you know. The groups now occupied withthe dissemination of occult teaching would be well-advised to change theirmethods if—beneath their pronounced ignorance and their love of thespectacular—there lies a true belief and a real humanitarian desire. Informationanent the Hierarchy should take the following lines:1. Emphasis should be laid on the evolution of humanity with peculiar attentionto its goal, perfection. This is not the idealistic perfection of the visionarymystic, but the control of the instrument, man in incarnation, by the indwellingand overshadowing soul. The constitution of man should be increasingly taught.2. The relation of the individual soul to all souls should be taught, and withit the recognition that the long-awaited kingdom of God is simply the appearanceof soul-controlled men on earth in everyday life and at all stages of thatcontrol.3. From a recognition of this relationship, the fact of the spiritual Hierarchycan then be deduced and the normality of its existence emphasised. The fact willappear that the Kingdom has always been present but has remained unrecognised,owing to the relatively few people who express, as yet, its quality.4. When this recognition has become general, the idea (by this time permanentlypresent in the human consciousness everywhere) and good sense also will testifyto the fact of the presence of Those Who have achieved the goal; Theirdemonstration of divinity will be regarded as normal, as constituting auniversal objective, and as the guarantee of humanity’s future achievement;degrees of this divine expression can then be pointed out, ranging from that ofthe probationary disciple, through disciples, to Those Who have achievedmastery, and up to and inclusive of the Christ.5. Thus gradually the idea or concept of the existence, in bodily presence, ofthe Masters will be inculcated and steadily [589] accepted; a new attitude tothe Christ will be developed which will be inclusive of all the best that thepast has given to us but which will integrate men into a more sane andacceptable approach to the entire problem.6. The time will come when the fact of the presence on earth of the Christ asHead of the Hierarchy and the Director of the Kingdom of God will be accepted;men will also realise the truth of the present revolutionary statement that atno time has He ever left the earth.7. Emphasis will also increasingly be laid upon the unfolding Plan, and men willbe brought to its recognition through a study of the evolution of the humanfamily, through a close consideration of historical processes, and through acomparative analysis of ancient and modern civilisations and cultures. Thethread of purpose will be noted and followed through, century after century,integrating not only history into one complete story of the revelation of divinequalities through the medium of humanity, but integrating with it and into itall world philosophies, the central theme of all creative art, the symbolism ofarchitecture and the conclusions of science.This approach of the central fact of human evolution—the steady growth ofdivinity and the revelation through man of divine powers—will offset thefanciful, fantastic presentation of the Hierarchy which has coloured all theoccult movements and the various Theosophical and Rosicrucian presentations. Thesubject will be presented in a manner acceptable and reasonable. It will not bea slower process, but the reverse. The results of the old and foolish way ofintroducing the subject has greatly retarded the intended work. Men, however, inthe future, will accept with rapidity and thankfully what is reasonable andwhich has its roots in the past, can be proven by history, and which presents atrue and possible hope for the future.It can be expected that the orthodox Christian will at first reject the theoriesabout the Christ which occultism presents; at the same time, this same orthodoxChristian [590] will find it increasingly difficult to induce the intelligentmasses of people to accept the impossible Deity and the feeble Christ whichhistorical Christianity has endorsed. A Christ Who is present and living, Who isknown to those who follow Him, Who is a strong and able executive and not asweet and sentimental sufferer, Who has never left us but Who has worked for twothousand years through the medium of His disciples, the inspired men and womenof all faiths, all religions and all religious persuasions; Who has no use forfanaticism or hysterical devotion but Who loves all men persistently,intelligently and optimistically, Who sees divinity in them all and Whocomprehends the techniques of the evolutionary development of the humanconsciousness (mental, emotional and physical, producing civilisations andcultures appropriate to a particular point in evolution)—these ideas theintelligent public can and will accept.They will prepare and work for conditions in the world in which Christ can movefreely among men, in bodily Presence; He need not then remain in His presentretreat in Central Asia. They can and will accept with ease the unity of allfaiths when the relationship of the Buddha and the Christ is correctlypresented; then the picture of a Christ demanding a unique position, to theexclusion of all other sons of God, will fade out in the wonder of the trueapostolic succession, in which many sons of God, on different rays, of differingnationalities and with varying missions, are to be seen historically leadinghumanity along the path of divine unfoldment and nearer to God, the Source.Temporarily, the fact of God Immanent will engross the attention of all truespiritual teachers, and the fact of that divine immanence making itself felt inperfection through the Christ and other divine Representatives will for a timerelegate the teaching on God Transcendent into the background. Undue emphasishas been placed on this major truth, to the exclusion of the nearer and morepractical truth of God in every man and in every form in every kingdom innature; much evil has eventuated by the failure to lay the emphasis upon GodImmanent. Later on, when the [591] truth of the Christ indwelling every man andrevealed in perfection through the historical Christ and His great Brothers downthe ages has been accepted, the teaching of God Transcendent, which is thesecret mystery in the custody of Shamballa, will be revealed and emphasised. Thetwo halves of a perfect Whole will then be recognised by humanity.The key to the Hierarchy and Its reappearance on earth in physical form, and theconsequent materialisation of the kingdom of God among men, is the simple truthof God Immanent . It is the clue to the evolutionary process, and the eternalhope of all forms in all kingdoms in nature. This is the central truth, theconvincing truth, and the revealing truth which will underlie all informationanent the Hierarchy, and this the coming generation of disciples willdistribute. If this truth is factual and possible of demonstration, then thefact of the Hierarchy is proved and the authenticity of the eternal existence ofthe kingdom of God on earth is established.THE RETURN OF THE CHRISTMay 1947(Part of this message and the one following it on page 612 appear in thechapters III and VII of ‘The Reappearance of the Christ’. Chronologically theybelong in the historical sequence here given.)Year after year I have written you (and all who care to listen) a message whichhas often been prophetic, always related to the fundamental spiritual union ofthe East and the West, of the Buddha and the Christ, and which has consistentlylaid emphasis upon the immediate spiritual opportunity. Every year I haveprepared these messages with great care, and in their synthesis there emerges(if you have read them in order and intelligently) a picture of the spirituallife of the world. It is a picture which involves the knowable past, whichconcerns the immediate present, and carries forward into a future of spiritualunfoldment, transcending in [592] expression all that has hitherto been known,because it has ever been based on the reality, on the fact of God Immanent.God Transcendent, greater, vaster and more inclusive than His created world, isuniversally recognised and has been generally emphasised; all faiths can saywith Shri Krishna (speaking as God, the Creator) that “having pervaded the wholeuniverse with a fragment of Myself, I remain.” This God Transcendent hasdominated the religious thinking of millions of simple and spiritually-mindedpeople down the centuries which have elapsed since humanity began to pressforward towards divinity.Slowly, there is dawning upon the awakening consciousness of humanity, the greatparalleling truth of God Immanent—divinely “pervading” all forms, conditioningfrom within all kingdoms in nature, expressing innate divinity through humanbeings and—two thousand years ago—portraying the nature of that divine Immanencein the Person of the Christ. Today, as an outcome of this unfolding divinePresence, there is entering into the minds of men everywhere a new concept: thatof Christ in us, the hope of Glory. There is a growing and developing beliefthat Christ is in us, as He was in the Master Jesus, and this belief will alterworld affairs and mankind’s entire attitude to life.The wonder of that Life lived two thousand years ago is still with us and haslost none of its freshness; it is an eternal inspiration, hope, encouragementand example. The love He demonstrated still holds the thinking world in thrall,even though relatively few have really attempted to demonstrate the same qualityof love as He did—a love that leads unerringly to world service, to completeself-forgetfulness and to radiant, magnetic living. The words He spoke were fewand simple, and all men can understand them, but their significance has largelybeen lost in the intricate legalities and discussions of St. Paul, and thelengthy disputations of theological commentators since He lived and left us—orapparently left us.Yet—today Christ is nearer to humanity than at any other time in human history;He is closer than the most [593] aspiring and hopeful disciple knows, and candraw closer still if what I here propose to write is understood and brought tothe attention of men everywhere. For Christ belongs to humanity, to the world ofmen, and not only to the churches and faiths throughout the world.Around Him—in that High Place on Earth where He has His abiding place—aregathered today all His great Disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom, and all Thoseliberated Sons of God Who, down the ages, have passed from darkness to Light,from the unreal to the Real, and from death to Immortality; They stand ready tocarry out His bidding and to obey the Master of all the Masters and the Teacheralike of Angels and of men. The Exponents and the Representatives of all theworld faiths are there waiting—under His guidance—to reveal to all those whotoday struggle in the maelstrom of world affairs, and who seek to solve theworld crisis, that they are not alone. God Transcendent is working through theChrist and the Spiritual Hierarchy to bring relief; God Immanent in all men isstanding on the verge of certain stupendous Recognitions.The great Apostolic Succession of the Knowers of God is poised today for renewedactivity—a Succession of Those Who have lived on earth, accepted the fact of GodTranscendent, discovered the reality of God Immanent, portrayed in Their Ownlives the divine characteristics of the Christ life and (because They lived onearth as He did and does ) have “entered for us within the veil, leaving us anexample that we too should follow His steps,” and Theirs. We too belongeventually in that great Succession.You may wonder why, at this hour of the Festival of the Buddha, I am writing toyou anent His great Brother, the Christ. I am doing it with deliberation becausethe eyes of all spiritual Knowers are fixed upon Him, because the Buddha Himselfis standing behind Him in humble recognition of the divine task which He is onthe verge of consummating, and because of the imminence of that spiritualaccomplishment. I write thus because not only are all those who are functioningconsciously in the Kingdom of God [594] aware of His plans, but because thosegreat spiritual Beings Who live and dwell in the “Father’s House,” in the“centre where the Will of God is known,” are also mobilised and organised toassist His work. The spiritual line of succession from the throne of the Ancientof Days down to the humblest disciple (gathered with others at the feet of theChrist) is today focussed on the task of helping humanity.The great moment for which He has so patiently waited has almost arrived; the“end of the age” to which He referred when speaking to His small group ofdisciples—“Lo! I am with you all the days even unto the end of the age”—has comeand today He stands and waits, knowing that the hour has come when He will “seeof the travail of His soul and be satisfied.” May I repeat: Right through thespiritual succession of the Sons of God there is naught to be seen and felt butexpectancy and preparation.From the Father’s House (the Shamballa of the esotericist) the fiat has goneforth: “The hour has come.” From the kingdom of God where reigns the Christ, theanswer has been flung back: CFather, Thy will be done”; down in our struggling,bewildered, unhappy world of men, the cry is ceaselessly rising: “May Christreturn to Earth.” Thus in the three great spiritual centres—the Father’s House,the Kingdom of God, and awakening Humanity—there is but one Purpose, one ideaand one united expectancy. . . .I write here in no fanatical or adventist spirit; I speak not as a speculativetheologian or an exponent of one phase of religious wishful thinking. I speakbecause the time is ripe and because the appeal of simple faithful hearts haspenetrated to the highest spiritual sphere and set in motion energies and forceswhich cannot now be stopped; I speak because the invocative cry of distressedhumanity is today of such a volume and sound that—united to the wisdom and theknowledge of the spiritual Hierarchy—it has given rise to certain activities inthe Father’s House. These will result in the glory of God, in the transformationof the divine will-to-good into human goodwill and resultant peace on Earth.[595] A new chapter in the great book of spiritual living is about to bewritten; a new expansion of consciousness is an imminent happening; a freshrecognition of divine attentiveness is now possible to humanity, and a revealingexpectancy will prove the accuracy of the Biblical statement, “every eye shallsee Him.” The religious livingness or spiritual history of mankind can besummarised for us by a series of recognitions—recognition of Those Who, down theages, have constituted the Apostolic Succession, culminating for us in the greatreligious leaders who have come out among us since 700 B.C. and founded thegreat modern world faiths, and—above all else—in the Christ Himself Who embodiedthe perfection of God Immanent, plus awareness of God Transcendent; recognitionof those major spiritual concepts of love, life and relationship which havehovered ever in the background of man’s thinking and which are now on the vergeof right expression; recognition of the true brotherhood of man, based on theone divine life, working through the one soul and expressing itself through theone humanity; recognition, therefore, of relationship both to the divine lifethroughout the world and to mankind itself. It is this developing spiritualattitude which will lead to right human relations and eventual world peace.Today another recognition is becoming possible. It is the recognition everywhereof the imminent return of Christ (if such a phrase can be true of One Who hasnever left us) and of the new spiritual opportunities which this event will makepossible.The basis for this recognition lies in the deep-seated conviction, innate in thehuman consciousness, that some great Teacher, some Saviour, Revealer, Lawgiveror divine Representative must come forth from the world of spiritual realities,because of human need and human demand. Always, down the centuries, at the hourof man’s greatest need and in response to his voiced demand, a divine Son of Godhas come forth and under many different names. Then the Christ came andapparently left us, with His work unfinished and His vision for mankind not yetconsummated. For two [596] thousand years it has seemed as if all His work hadbeen blocked, frustrated, and of no avail—for the growth of the churches duringthe centuries is no guarantee of the spiritual success at which He aimed. Itneeded more than theological interpretations and the numerical growth of theworld religions (including Christianity and Buddhism) to prove His world missionsuccessfully carried forward. It all seemed impossible, necessitating threeconditions; in these a test of His work could be attempted; today these threeconditions are proven facts.First: a general planetary situation which has (unfortunately owing to man’sselfishness) proved to be so catastrophic in nature that humanity has beenforced to recognise the cause and source of the disaster; secondly, a spiritualawakening which would have its impulse in the deepest depths of man’sconsciousness, and such is the case today as a result of the world war(1914-1945); thirdly, a steadily mounting invocative cry, prayer or demand,directed toward high spiritual sources, no matter by what names such sources maybe called.Today, all these three conditions have been fulfilled and humanity faces renewedopportunity. The disaster which has overtaken mankind is universal andwidespread; no one has escaped, and all men are involved in some way oranother—physically, economically and socially. The spiritual awakening of meneverywhere (within or without the world faiths, and largely outside of them) isgeneral and complete, and a turning to God is to be seen on every hand. Finally,these two causes have aroused—as never before—the invocative cry of humanity; itis clearer, purer and more selfless than at any other time in human history,because it is based on clearer thinking and common distress. True religion isagain emerging in the hearts of men in every land; this recognition of a divinehope and background may possibly take people back into the churches and worldfaiths, but it will most certainly take them back to God.Religion is the name, surely, which we give to the invocative appeal of humanitywhich leads to the evocative response [597] of the Spirit of God. This Spiritworks in every human heart and in all groups. It works through the spiritualHierarchy of the planet; it impels the Head of the Hierarchy, the Christ, totake action, and the action which He is taking will lead to His return, with Hisdisciples.I wonder if you appreciate the import of what I have just said? The idea of thereturn of Christ is a most familiar one, and the concept of a returning Son ofGod in response to human need has its place in the teaching of the majority ofthe world faiths. Ever since He apparently departed to the sphere where thefaithful have put Him, little groups of these people have reasoned themselvesinto the belief that on such and such a date He will come back, and ever theirprophecies and expectancies have been doomed to failure. He has not come. Suchpeople have been laughed at by the crowd and rebuked by the intelligent. Theireyes have not seen Him and there has been no tangible indication of HisPresence. Today, I tell you that He will come; that plans for His coming arealready set on foot, but I set no date or hour. The time is known only to thetwo or three, but “in such an hour as ye think not, He will come.” (Matt. XXIV.44)I tell you, first of all, a truth hard for the orthodox thinker of any faith toaccept: He cannot return because He has always been here upon our Earth,watching over the spiritual destiny of humanity; He has never left us, but inphysical body and securely concealed (though not hidden), He has guided theaffairs of the spiritual Hierarchy, of His disciples and workers who areunitedly pledged with Him to Earth Service. He can only reappear . It is aspiritual fact that those who have passed from the cave of the tomb into thefullness of the resurrection life can be seen, and at the same time evade thevision of the believer; seeing and recognition are two very different things,and one of the great recognitions of mankind in the near future is therecognition that always He has been with us and shared with us the familiarusefulness and peculiar characteristics of our civilisation and its many giftsto man.[598] The early signs of His approach with His disciples can already bediscerned by those who note and rightly interpret the signs of the times. Thereis (among these signs) the coming together spiritually of those who love theirfellowmen. This is in reality the organising of the outer physical army of theLord—an army which has no weapons but those of love, of right speech and righthuman relations. This unknown organisation has proceeded with phenomenal speedduring the aftermath of war, because humanity is sick of hate and ofcontroversy.The general staff of the Christ is already active in the form of the New Groupof World Servers; they are as potent a body of forerunners as has ever precededa great world Figure into the arena of mankind’s living. Their work andinfluence is already seen and felt in every land, and nothing can destroy thatwhich they have accomplished. The spiritual and organising effect of sound inthe form of expressed and voiced invocation has been also attempted since 1935,and the energy of the invocative cry of humanity has been directed into thosechannels which reach from Earth to that High Place where dwells the Christ. Fromthere, it has been transmitted on to those still higher spheres where theattention of the Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days, the Father of all, plusthe Creative Energies and Living Beings Who dwell there with Him, can befocussed on humanity and those steps can be taken which will embody more rapidlythe Purposes of God.For the first time in human history, the demand of the people of the Earth is sopotent and so in line with divine direction in time and space that the end isinevitably sure; the looked-for spiritual Representative must come forth, andthis time He will not come alone but will be accompanied by Those Whose livesand words will evoke recognition in every department of human thinking. Thesymbolic prophecies found in all the world Scriptures anent this imminent eventwill prove their veracity; their symbolism will nevertheless elicitre-interpretation, and circumstances and happenings will not necessarily beexactly as the Scriptures [599] would appear to indicate. For instance, He willcome indeed “in the clouds of the air” as the Christian Scriptures say (Matt.XXIV. 30), but of what great interest is that when millions come and go in theclouds each hour of the day and of the night? I mention this as one of theoutstanding prophecies and one of the most familiar; it is, however, one whichmeans little in our modern civilisation. The fact that is of importance is thatHe will come.The Wesak Festival has been held, down the centuries, in the well-known valleyin the Himalayas (if the faithful would only believe it) in order:1. To substantiate the fact of Christ’s physical existence among us ever sinceHis so-called departure.2. To prove (on the physical plane) the factual solidarity of the Eastern andWestern approaches to God. Both the Christ and the Buddha are then present.3. To form a rallying-point and a meeting-place for those who annually—insynthesis and symbolically—link up and represent the Father’s House, the Kingdomof God, and Humanity.4. To demonstrate the nature of the work of Christ as the great and chosenIntermediary, standing as the Representative of the spiritual Hierarchy and asthe Leader of the New Group of World Servers, and in His Person voicing theirdemand for the recognition of the factual existence of the Kingdom of God hereand now.Perhaps one of the major messages I have for all of you who read my words isthis great truth and fact of the physical Presence on Earth at this time of theChrist, of His group of Disciples and Executives, of Their representativeactivities on behalf of mankind and of Their close relationship. Thisrelationship comes out at certain of the great spiritual Festivals whererelationship includes not only the Kingdom of God but also the Father and theFather’s Home. There is the Festival of Easter; the Festival of the Buddha [600]Who, in physical Presence, expresses the spiritual solidarity of our planet; andthe Festival in June, peculiarly the Festival of the Christ, when He—as Leaderof the New Group of World Servers—employs the new Invocation on behalf of allmen of goodwill in all lands; at the same time, He gathers up the inchoate andunexpressed demands of those masses who seek a new and better way of life. Theywant love in daily living, right human relations, and an understanding of theunderlying Plan.It is these physical happenings which are of moment, and not the vague hopes andpromises of the theological faiths. It is the physical Presence upon our planetof such recognised spiritual Figures as the Lord of the World, the Ancient ofDays; the seven Spirits Who are before the throne of God; of the Buddha, thespiritual leader of the East, and the Christ, the spiritual leader of the West,which I bring at this climaxing time to your attention. To you I say that thevague belief in Their existence, the dreamy speculations as to Their work andTheir interest in human welfare, and the unconvinced, yet hopeful, wishfulthinking of believers (and also unbelievers), will soon give place to certainknowledge, to visual recognition, to provable signs of executive work, and tothe reorganisation (by men of unusual potency) of the political, religious,economic and social life of the planet.All this will not come as the result of some proclamation or some stupendousplanetary event which will force human beings everywhere to say: Lo! He isthere! Lo! Here are the signs of His divinity! for that would evoke onlyantagonism and laughter, resistance or fanatical credulity. It will come as arecognition of potency in leadership, through dynamic but logical changes inworld affairs, and through action taken by the masses of the people from thedepths of their own consciousness.Many years ago I indicated that the Christ would come in three ways, or rather,that the fact of His Presence could be proved in three distinctive phases.I said then that the first move which the Hierarchy [601] would make would bethe stimulation of the spiritual consciousness in man, the evocation ofhumanity’s spiritual demands on a large scale, and the nurturing—on a worldwidescale—of the Christ consciousness in the human heart. This has already beendone, and with most effective results. Of the factual nature of this process thevociferous demands of men of goodwill, of welfare workers and of those pledgedto international cooperation, to the relief of world distress and to theestablishment of right human relations are the undeniable expression. That phaseof the preparatory work which is indicative of His coming has now reached astage where nothing can arrest its progress or slow down its momentum. In spiteof appearances, this uprising of the Christ-consciousness has been successful,and what may appear as reverse activity is of no importance in the long run, andonly of a temporary nature.The second move of the Hierarchy, I told you, would be the impressing of theminds of enlightened men everywhere by spiritual ideas embodying the new truths,by the “descent” (if I may so call it) of the new concepts which will governhuman living, and by the over-shadowing of all world disciples and the New Groupof World Servers by the Christ Himself. You will recall how, in the Bible story,Christ symbolically evoked the recognition of John the Baptist and imparted thethings of the Kingdom of God to the disciples who walked to Emmaus, though theyrecognised not their Companion. This planned move of the Hierarchy is alsoprogressing well; men and women everywhere and in every department of life areenunciating those new truths which should in the future guide human living; theyare building those new organisations, movements and groups—large or small—whichwill familiarise the mass of men with the reality of the need and the mode ofmeeting it. This they are doing because they are driven thereto by the warmth oftheir hearts and their loving response to human distress; without formulating itthus to themselves, they are nevertheless working to bring into visibility theKingdom of God on earth. No denial of these facts is possible, [602] in view ofthe multiplicity of this type of organisations, books and speeches.Thirdly, I told you that Christ might come in person and walk among men as Hedid before. This has not yet taken place, but plans are being laid which willenable Him to do so. Those plans do not involve the birth of some nice child insome nice home on earth; they will not produce the wild claims and the credulousrecognition of the well-meaning and the unintelligent, as is so frequently thecase today, nor will someone appear and say: This is the Christ. He is here orHe is there. I would point out to you, however, that the widespread appearanceof such tales and claims, though undesirable, misleading and wrong, neverthelessdemonstrates human expectancy of the imminence of His coming. Belief in Hiscoming is basic in the human consciousness. How He will come, in what manner, Imay not and should not say. The exact moment has not yet arrived, nor has themethod of His appearance been determined. The factual nature of the two earlierand preparatory moves, already made by the Hierarchy under His direction, arethe guarantee that He will come and that—when He does—mankind will be ready.For a brief moment, I would like to summarise certain aspects of the work He setin motion two thousand years ago, because it holds the clue to His future work.Some of it is well known to you, for it has been emphasised by the world faithsand particularly by teachers of the Christian faith. But all of them have madeHis work appear difficult for man to grasp, and the undue emphasis laid upon Hisdivinity (an emphasis which He Himself never made) has made it appear that Heand He only, and no one else, could possibly do the same things. Theologianshave forgotten that He Himself stated that “greater things shall ye do, becauseI go unto the Father” (John XIV. 12). He here indicates that this passing to theFather’s House would result in such an inflow of spiritual strength, insight andcreative accomplishment in men, that their deeds would surpass His. Because ofthe distortion of His teaching and its remote relation to man, [603] we have notyet done those “greater things.” Some day we assuredly will, and—along certainlines—we already have. Let me relate some of the things He did which we can do,and which He will aid.1. For the first time in human history, the love of God was embodied in a man,and Christ inaugurated the era of love. That expression of divine love is stillin the making; the world is not yet full of love and few there are thatunderstand the true meaning of the word. But—speaking symbolically—when theUnited Nations has emerged into factual and actual power, the welfare of theworld will then be assured. What is that welfare but love in action? What areright human relations but love among men, groups and nations? What isinternational cooperation but love on a world scale? Those are the things whichthe love of God in Christ expressed, and those are the things which we areworking here today to bring into being. We are attempting to do it on a vastscale, and this in spite of opposition—an opposition which can only temporarilysucceed, such is the potency of the awakened spirit of man. These are the thingswhich the Hierarchy, in its already successful procedures, is aiding and willcontinue to aid.2. Christ taught also that the Kingdom of God is on Earth and told us to seekthat Kingdom first and let all things go for its sake. That Kingdom has everbeen with us, composed of all those who, down the ages, have sought spiritualgoals, liberated themselves from the limitations of the physical body, emotionalcontrols and the obstructive mind. Its citizens are those who today (unknown tothe majority) live in physical bodies, work for the welfare of humanity, uselove instead of emotion as their general technique, and compose that great bodyof “illumined Minds” which guide the destiny of the world. The Kingdom of God isnot something which will descend on earth when men are good enough! It issomething which is functioning efficiently today and demanding recognition. Itis an organised body which is already evoking recognition from those people who[604] do seek first the Kingdom of God and discover thereby that the Kingdomthey seek is already here. Christ and His disciples are known by many to bephysically present on Earth and the Kingdom which They rule, with its laws andmodes of activity are familiar to many, and have been throughout the centuries.Christ is the World Healer and Saviour. He works because He is the embodied soulof all Reality. He works today, as he worked in Palestine two thousand yearsago, through groups. There He worked through the three beloved disciples,through the twelve apostles, through the chosen seventy, and the interested fivehundred.... Now He works through His Masters and Their groups, and therebygreatly intensifies His efforts. He can and will work through all groups just inso far as they fit themselves for planned service, for the distribution of love,and come into conscious alignment with the great potency of the inner groups.Esotericists, occult students, Rosicrucians and Theosophists have alwaysproclaimed the physical Presence of the Christ, but have so distorted theteaching by dogmatic assertions on unimportant details and by ridiculous claims,that they have evoked little recognition of the underlying truth, nor have theyportrayed a Kingdom which is attractive. Yet that Kingdom exists and is not aplace of disciplines or golden harps and peopled by unintelligent fanatics, buta field of service and a place where every man has full scope for the exerciseof his divinity in human service.3. At the Transfiguration, Christ revealed the glory which is innate in all men.The triple lower nature—physical, emotional and mental—is there shown asprostrate before the glory which was revealed. In that moment, wherein ChristImmanent was in the physical form, wherein humanity was represented by the threeapostles, a Voice came from the Father’s Home in recognition of the revealeddivinity and the Sonship of the Transfigured Christ. On this innate divinity,upon this recognised Sonship, is the brotherhood of all men based—one life, oneglory which shall be revealed, [605] and one divine relationship. Today, on alarge scale (even when by-passing the implications of divinity) the glory of manand his fundamental relationships are already a fact in the human consciousness.Accompanying those characteristics which as yet remain deplorable and whichwould appear to negate all claims to divinity, is the wonder of man’sachievement, of his triumph over nature. The glory of scientific attainment andthe magnificent evidence of creative art—both modern and ancient—leave no roomto question man’s divinity. Here then are the “greater things” of which Christspoke, and here again is the triumph of the Christ within the human heart.Why this triumph of the Christ consciousness must always be spoken of in termsof religion, of church-going and of orthodox belief is one of the incredibletriumphs of the forces of evil. To be a citizen of the Kingdom of God does notmean that one must necessarily be a member of some one of the orthodox churches.The divine Christ in the human heart can express itself in many differentdepartments of human living—in politics, in the arts, in economic expression andin true social living, in science and in religion. It might be wise here toremember that the only time it is recorded that Christ (as an adult) visited theTemple of the Jews, He created a disturbance! Humanity is passing from glory toglory and, in the long panorama of history, this is strikingly observable. Theglory is today revealed in every department of human activity, and theTransfiguration of those who are on the crest of the human wave of civilisationis very close at hand.4. Finally, in the triumph of the Crucifixion or (as it is more accuratelycalled in the East) the Great Renunciation, Christ, for the first time, anchoredon earth a tenuous thread of the divine Will, as it issued from the Father’sHouse (Shamballa), passed into the understanding custody of the Kingdom of God,and through the medium of the Christ was brought to the attention of mankind.Through the instrumentality of certain great Sons of God the three divineaspects or characteristics of the divine Trinity—will, [606] love andintelligence—have become a part of human thinking and aspiration. Christians areapt to forget that the crisis in the final hours of the Christ was not in thosespent upon the Cross, but during those spent in the Garden of Gethsemane, whenHis will—in agony and almost despair—was submerged in that of the Father.“Father,” He said, “not my will but Thine be done.” (Luke XXII. 42.)Something new, yet planned for from the very depth of time, happened then inthat quiet garden; Christ, representing mankind, anchored or established theFather’s will on earth and made it possible for intelligent humanity to carry itout. Hitherto, that Will had been known in the Father’s House; it had beenrecognised and adapted to world need by the spiritual Hierarchy, working underthe Christ, and thus took shape as the divine Plan. Today, because of whatChrist did in His moment of crisis hundreds of years ago, humanity can add itsefforts to the working out of that Plan. The will-to-good of the Father’s Housecan become the goodwill of the Kingdom of God and be transformed into righthuman relations by intelligent humanity. Thus the direct line or thread of God’swill reaches now from the highest place to the lowest point and can, in duetime, become a cable of ascension for the sons of men and of descent for theloving, living spirit of God.I would have you forget distance, remoteness and vagueness and realise that I amtalking of exact and literal happenings on our planet. I am dealing withrecognitions and occurrences and with factual events which are the consciouspossession of many. The Christ of history and the Christ in the human heart areplanetary facts.There is one aspect of this return of the Christ which is never touched upon andto which no reference is ever made. I, a humble disciple of the Christ, wouldlike here to speak of it. It is the factor of what this coming out again amongmen, this return to outer everyday activity, will mean to the Christ as He facesit. How will He feel when the hour of His appearance arrives?[607] There is a great initiation spoken of in the New Testament, to which wehave given the name of the Ascension. Of it we know nothing. Only a few items ofinformation are brought to us in the Gospel story: the fact of the mountain top,of attendant watchers, and of the words of Christ, assuring them that He was notleaving them. Then the clouds received Him out of their sight. There were nonepresent who could go further with Him. Their consciousness could not penetrateto the place where He had chosen to go; they even misinterpreted His words andonly in a vague and mystical sense has humanity ever understood Hisdisappearance or the significance of His persistent but unobserved Presence. Thewatchers were assured by two of the Knowers of God Who were also present that Hewould come again in like manner. He ascended. The clouds received Him and todaythe clouds which cover our planet are waiting to reveal Him.He is now waiting to descend. This descent into our unhappy world of men canpresent Him with no alluring picture. From the quiet mountain retreat where Hehas waited, guided and watched over humanity, and where He has trained Hisdisciples, initiates and the New Group of World Servers, He must come forth andtake His place prominently on the world stage, and take His part in the greatdrama which is there being played. This time, He will play His part, not inobscurity as He previously did, but before the eyes of the entire world. Becauseof the smallness of our little planet, and because of the prevalence of theradio, television and the rapidity of communication, His part will be watched byall, and the prospect must surely, for Him, hold certain horror, must presentits tests and major adjustments, plus painful and unavoidable experience. Hedoes not come as the omnipotent God of man’s ignorant creation, but as theChrist, the Founder of the Kingdom of God on Earth, to complete the work Hestarted, and again to demonstrate divinity in far more difficult circumstances.The Christ suffers, however, far more from those in [608] His Own household thanfrom those in the outer world; His work is more impeded by the advanced aspirantthan by the intelligent thinker. It was not the cruelty of the outer world ofmen which caused the depths of sorrow to the Christ; it was His Own disciples,plus the massed sorrow—spread over the entire cycle of living—past, present andfuture—of humanity.He comes to correct the mistakes and the misrepresentations of those who havedared to interpret His simple words in terms of their own ignorance, and torecognise those whose faithful service has made His return possible. He too isfacing a major test, preparatory to a great initiation, and when He has passedthe test and fulfilled His task He will pass to a still more exalted position inthe Father’s House or to some distant place of service where only the mostexalted can follow Him; His present position will then be taken by the One WhomHe has prepared and trained.But before all this can happen He must again enter the public arena, play Hispart in world affairs and prove the scope of His mission. He will gather aroundHim, in the flesh, His chosen associates and advisors; these will not be theones who gathered around Him in those earlier simpler days, but those members ofour human family who today recognise Him and are preparing to work with Him asfar as in them lies. It is a different world to which He is now planning toreturn and this is largely due to the intellectual development of the mass ofmen. This presents Him with stupendous difficulties, for the intellects of menmust now be reached and not just their hearts (as in the earlier days), if theWill of God is to be intelligently carried out on Earth. His major task issurely the establishing of right human relations in every department of humanliving. I would ask you to use your divine imagination and endeavour to thinkout what must be the implications of the task which confronts Him; I would askyou to ponder on the difficulties which He must inevitably face—the difficulty,above all, of mass intellectual wrong emphasis.[609] He, the Representative of the love of God, is asked to work again in theworld arena wherein His earlier message has been negated, forgotten ormisinterpreted for two thousand years, and wherein hate and separativeness havedistinguished all men everywhere. This will plunge Him into a foreign atmosphereand into a situation wherein all His divine resources will be needed and will betried to the uttermost. The generally accepted idea that He will return as atriumphant warrior, omnipotent and irresistible, has surely no basis in fact.That He will ultimately lead His people, humanity, into Jerusalem is a fact,founded on a secure foundation; but it will not be into a Jewish city calledJerusalem, but into “the place of peace” (as the word Jerusalem means). Acareful consideration of the world situation today, and a dedicated use of theimagination, will reveal to the sincere thinker how appalling is the task whichHe has undertaken. But He has again “set His face to go up to Jerusalem” (LukeIX. 51); He will again appear and guide mankind into a civilisation and a stateof consciousness in which right human relations and worldwide cooperation forthe good of all will be the universal keynote. He will—through the New Group ofWorld Servers and the men of goodwill—complete His association with the Will ofGod (His Father’s business) in such a manner that the eternal will-to-good willbe translated by humanity into goodwill and right relations. Then His task willbe done; He will be free again to leave us, this time not to return, but toleave the world of men in the hands of that great spiritual Server Who will bethe new Head of the Hierarchy, the Church Invisible.The question now arises: In what way can we be of service? How can we aid duringthis preparatory stage?On this point I have but little to say. The whole idea of His return is sofamiliar to you in its anticipatory nature (though not in the factual details asI have hinted them to you) that I find it hard to say anything practical orwhich will arrest your attention.[610] What the members of the spiritual Hierarchy are doing is much indeed;those disciples who are in conscious touch with the Masters of the Wisdom—or, ifyou prefer the term, with the senior disciples of the Christ—are working day andnight in order to establish such confidence, correct attitudes and understandingof the divine spiritual “push” or enterprise that His way will be made easier.They and their groups of lesser disciples, aspirants and students of therealities stand unitedly behind the Christ and can thus enable Him to accomplishHis purpose. Their major realisation is that of a cyclic crisis in the spirituallife of our planet; it is one which has been anticipated in the Father’s House(Shamballa) for thousands of years. They have registered the fact that, for thefirst time in human history, all the three spiritual centres or groups throughwhich God works are unitedly focussed on the same objective. Shamballa, theSpiritual Hierarchy, and Humanity (the Father’s House, the Kingdom of God, andthe world of men) are all striving in one vast movement for an intensificationof the Light of the World. This Light will irradiate in a fashion unknownbefore, not only the Father’s House, which is the source of all our planetarylight, but also the spiritual centre from which have come all Those Teachers andWorld Saviours Who have stood before men and said, as did Hermes, the Buddha andthe Christ: “I am the Light of the World.” This light will now flood the worldof men, bringing illumination to men’s minds and light into the dark places ofhuman living.It is light and—above all else—“life more abundantly” which Christ will bring,and until He brings it we know not what it signifies; we cannot realise therevelation which this will entail and the new possibilities which will openbefore us. But through Him, light and life are on their way, to be interpretedand applied in terms of goodwill and of right human relations. For this thespiritual Hierarchy is preparing. This time the Christ will not come alone, forHis co-workers will come with Him. His experience and Theirs will be the reverseof the previous one, for this time [611] every eye will see Him, every ear willhear Him, and every mind will pass judgment upon Him.Therefore I say that you can freely aid in the reconstruction work which theChrist proposes, if you will familiarise yourselves and all men whom you cancontact with the following facts:1. That the return of Christ is imminent.2. That the Christ, immanent in every heart, can be evoked in recognition of Hisappearance.3. That the circumstances of His return are only symbolically related in theworld Scriptures; this may produce a vital change in the preconceived ideas ofhumanity.4. That the major required preparation is a world at peace; however, that peacemust be based on an educated goodwill, which will lead inevitably to right humanrelations, and therefore to the establishment (figuratively speaking) of linesof light between nation and nation, religion and religion, group and group, andman and man.If you can succeed in presenting these four ideas to the world at large, thusovercoming the intelligent criticism that all that is said is too vague,prophetic, and visionary, you will do much. It is possible, surely, that theancient truism, “the mind is the slayer of the real” may be fundamentally truewhere the mass of humanity is concerned, and that the purely intellectualapproach (which rejects the vision and refuses to accept the unprovable) may befar more at fault than the anticipations of the Knowers of God and the expectantmultitude.The intelligence of divinity is vested in the spiritual Hierarchy, and thatHierarchy is today composed of Those Who have united in Themselves both theintellect and the intuition, the practical and the apparently impractical, thefactual way of life and the way of the man who sees a vision. There are also thepeople who must be found in the market [612] place of daily life; these are thepeople who must be trained in the divine recognitions which are essentiallyphysical plane responses to the new expansions of consciousness. The Christ Whowill return will not be like the Christ Who (apparently) departed. He will notbe a “man of sorrows”; He will not be a silent, pensive figure; He will be theenunciator of spiritual statements which will not necessitate interpretation(and give rise to misinterpretation) because He will be present to indicate thetrue meaning.He has been for two thousand years the supreme Head of the Church Invisible, thespiritual Hierarchy, composed of disciples of all faiths. He recognises andloves those who are not Christian but who retain their allegiance to theirFounders—the Buddha, Mohammed, and others. He cares not what the faith is, ifthe objective is love of God and of humanity. If men look for the Christ Wholeft His disciples centuries ago they will fail to recognise the Christ Who isin process of returning. The Christ has no religious barriers in Hisconsciousness. It matters not to Him of what faith a man may call himself.The Son of God is on His way and He cometh not alone. His advance guard isalready here and the Plan which they must follow is already made and clear. Letrecognition be the aim.PREPARATION FOR THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE CHRISTJune 1947I have much to say here as a sequence to my previous communication to you—andhere I am speaking to all aspirants and disciples. The opportunity is so greatat this time that I seek to face you with your choices, leaving you free to makeup your own minds. What you decide will, however, affect definitely theremainder of your life activity. Herein lies your challenge. What I have to sayis of a relatively simple nature—so simple that it may seem to you as [613] inthe nature of an anti-climax. Yet simple as the problem may be, it is mostdifficult to solve. Your reaction to what I have to say will depend upon thenature of your sense of values, and not upon any capacity for abstrusereasoning. The average human aspirant and the intelligent human being are apt toemphasise the present complexity of human affairs and events; these they believeare engulfing men in every land. They thus provide—for themselves—an answerablealibi.The emphasis of what I have to say is related to the message which I recentlysent out re the Return of the Christ. That message carried its own challenge andthe questions which it aroused in every sincere human heart are:1. How can I personally meet this challenge?2. What can I specifically do?3. What are the steps which I and every aspirant should take?These questions mean one thing to one person and another thing to another. Someof the replies will emerge as you read what I have to say. I am writing here forpeople who are disciples of the Christ, but my words can convey meaning to allsincere thinkers and Christian believers.The complexities and difficulties of this post-war period are very great. Thecloser an aspirant is to the source of spiritual light and power, the moredifficult is his problem, and at the same time the clearer will be hisunderstanding of the facts. Looking away from the detail of the foreground,which ever assumes undue proportions, and divorcing oneself from those detailsas they deluge one’s daily life with perplexities and anxieties, the problem isrelatively simple and twofold in nature.First of all, the outer, physical war is only just over; two years is a shorttime since the firing ceased and no country has as yet recovered from its direeffects. There is no true intercourse between nations and no true understanding.Today the United States permits the raising of [614] funds in order to arm theZionists against Great Britain, an ally and a friendly power; it is authorisingpropaganda against Russia, also an allied and friendly power. There is no trueeffort anywhere (carried on with fixed determination and right compromise) tobring to an end those economic conditions which are the major cause of war andwhich are responsible for breeding hatred among nations.Secondly (and of still more importance from the angle of the spiritual values,though less easily perceived), the Forces of Evil are still active; they mayhave been driven back, but they are still powerful; they are still subtlyworking and are still striving for a firmer foothold; they are still cleverlyfeeding world anxiety and world insecurity in order to create another point ofworld tension.Until these two sources of world tension are recognised and correctly handled,the life of the aspirant, and still more of the disciple, is exceedingly hard.You may retort (and truly) that the life of all who suffered through the war,the fate of the starving people who are still taking the brunt of the attack inEurope—the inhabitants of Great Britain, Italy, China, Poland, and the Balkans,plus Germany and Japan, who are responsible for the difficulty, and all who areengulfed in the results of Germany’s attack upon the world—is hard beyondendurance, and must therefore be shared by all aspirants and disciples. That isindeed true. But the more advanced thinkers and workers have far more than thegeneral fate to endure. They—if they open their hearts and minds—participate notonly in the difficulties confronting the mass of men everywhere, but they arealso aware of the spiritual possibilities ahead, of the task to be completed insealing “the door where evil dwells,” and of the stupendous and uniquecircumstances which are faced by those who recognise and accept the imminentreturn of the Christ.As the disciple confronts both the inner and the outer events and possibilities,he is apt to register a sense of complete frustration; he longs to help, butknows not what [615] to do; his grasp of the menacing difficulties, his analysisof his resources and of those with whom he works, and his clarity of perceptionas to the forces ranged against him, make him feel inclined to sit back and say:What is the use of any effort I can make? Why not let the two forces of good andevil, of the Black Lodge and the Spiritual Hierarchy, fight it out alone? Whynot permit the pressure of the evolutionary current, eventually and at longlast, to bring cessation to the fight and the triumph of the good? Why attemptto do it now?These are natural reactions when considering the present field of conflict, theprevalent greed and the international and racial antagonisms, and the selfishmotives which control so many national units, plus the dull apathy of themasses, and in particular, the growing suspicion and distrust between the UnitedStates and Russia—a situation in which both groups are almost equally to blame.This war-generating situation is fostered behind the scenes by the highly cleverand strongly anti-communistic power of the Roman Catholic Church, with itsorganised political plans—plans which are growing notably in the United States.To these, the intelligent thinker adds the reactionary activities in every land,and the fight for oil which governs the policies of Russia, the United Statesand Great Britain. To these factors must be added today the struggle betweenHindu and Moslem for the control of India, and the fight over Palestine—fomentedby the Zionists, and not by the Jews as a whole—a fight in which the Zionistsprevented the displaced Jewish persons (only 20% of the whole) from discoveringhow welcome they are in many countries throughout the world; a fight which hasgreed and not any love of Palestine behind it, and which is governed byfinancial interests and not by the humanitarian spirit which the Zionists claimand which would force them to accept the offers made by Great Britain, Canada,Chile, Belgium and many other lands.These factors, when realised by thinking men and women, produce a deepdiscouragement and a sense of futility and hopelessness. Instead, they should befaced [616] with courage, with truth and understanding, as well as with thewillingness to speak factually, with simplicity and with love in the effort toexpose the truth and clarify the problems which must be solved. The opposingforces of entrenched evil must be routed before He for Whom all men wait, theChrist, can come.The knowledge that He is ready and anxious publicly to appear to His lovedhumanity only adds to the sense of general frustration, and another very vitalquestion arises: For what period of time must we endure, struggle and fight? Thereply comes with clarity; He will come unfailingly when a measure of peace hasbeen restored, when the principle of sharing is at least in process ofcontrolling economic affairs, and when the churches have begun to clean house.Then He can and will come; then the Kingdom of God will be publicly recognisedand will no longer be a thing of dreams and of ideals.Aspirants are prone to ask the question as to why the Christ does not come—inthe pomp and ceremony which the churches ascribe to the event—and by His comingdemonstrate His divine power, prove convincingly the authority and the potencyof God, and thus end the cycle of agony and distress. The answers to this aremany. It must be remembered that the main objective of the Christ will not be todemonstrate power but to make public the already existent Kingdom of God. Again,when He came before He was unrecognised, and is there any guarantee that thistime it would be different? You may ask why would He not be recognised? Becausemen’s eyes are blinded with the tears of self-pity and not of contrition;because the hearts of men are still corroded with a selfishness which the agonyof war has not cured; because the standards of value are the same as in thecorrupt Roman Empire which saw His first appearance, only in those days thesestandards were localised and not universal; because those who could recogniseHim and who hope and long for His coming are not willing to make the neededsacrifices, and thus ensure the success of His advent.[617] Another factor militating against His being recognised, and one which willprobably surprise you, is the fact that there are so many exceedingly goodpeople in the world today, so many selfless workers and disciples and so manytruly saintly people, that the spiritual competition would call forth a degreeof holiness on His part which would negate His appropriation of a physical bodyof a calibre which would enable Him to manifest among men. This was not the casetwo thousand years ago; it is, however, the case today, so great is humanadvancement and the success of the evolutionary process. To enable Him today towalk among men requires a world which will have in it enough effective workersand spiritually-minded people to change the atmosphere of our planet; then andonly then, the Christ can and will, come. I am not, however, presenting you withan impossibility.Modern esotericism and the success of scientific, spiritual living are now sowidely recognised that the consciousness of men everywhere has been profoundlyaffected; this will be increasingly so as the hope of His coming and thepreparation for it spread among men. The situation indicates no divinefrustration (of which that of the world disciples might be the reflection), nordoes it indicate any inability to appear. Rather, it indicates the wonder of thedivinity in man and the success of the divine plan for man. Divinity, however,awaits the expression of man’s free will.Another answer is that when Christ comes forth from the Place of Power, bringingHis disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom, with Him, that Place of Love and Powerwill be situated on earth, and will be publicly recognised; the effects of thatappearance and of that recognition will be terrific, calling forth an equallyterrific onslaught and effort by the Forces of Evil—unless humanity itself hasfirst sealed “the door where evil dwells.” This must be done by the establishingof right human relations.Still another reply, upon which I would ask you to ponder, is that Christ andthe spiritual Hierarchy never—no matter what the incentive may be—infringe uponthe [618] divine right of humanity to achieve freedom by fighting for freedom,individually, nationally and internationally. When true freedom covers theearth, we shall see the end of tyranny, politically and religiously. I referhere not to modern democracy, which is at present a philosophy of wishfulthinking, but to that state of the realm in which the people themselves willrule; these people will not tolerate authoritarianism in any church, ortotalitarianism in any political system or government; they will not accept orpermit the rule of any body of men who undertake to tell them what they mustbelieve in order to be saved, or what government they must accept. I say notthat these desirable objectives must be accomplished facts on earth beforeChrist comes. I do say that this attitude to religion and politics must begenerally accepted as necessary to all men, and that steps must have beensuccessfully taken in the direction of right human relations.These are the things which the New Group of World Servers, the disciples, theaspirants and the men of goodwill everywhere must believe and teach inpreparation for His coming.There is, therefore, nothing to offset the sense of frustration (which isundeniably present and based on factual conditions) but the acceptance and thedevelopment of a state of mind which will be founded on a belief in the veracityof the historical records which bear witness to many advents at crucial times inhuman affairs, and to many world Saviours—of Whom the Christ was the greatest.The right and constructive attitude must also be based on an innate recognitionof the existence of the Christ and of His Presence with us at all times; it mustbe grounded in the knowledge that the war—with all its unspeakable horrors, itscruelties and its cataclysmic disasters—was but the broom of the Father of all,sweeping away obstructions in the path of His returning Son. It would have beenwell-nigh impossible to prepare for the coming in the face of the pre-warconditions. Upon these facts the New Group of World Servers must today taketheir stand. They must recognise the obstructing factors, [619] but must alsorefuse to be frustrated by them; they must be aware of the hindrances (many ofthem financial and based on material greed), and then employ such skill inaction and such business acumen that these hindrances will be overcome; theymust walk clear-eyed through world difficulties and—holding His five-pointedstar before them—pass unscathed and successful through the midst of allfrustrating factors.I seek not here to deal with the usual spiritual frustrations or wish to wastetime with the ordinary platitudes and the well understood replies, which do notaid because they remain platitudes and are not translated into action. I shalldeal here with only two factors which condition the present opportunity; thesecan be regarded as so completely hindering that, unless they are removed, therewill be a long delay before Christ can return. They are:1. The inertia of the average aspirant or spiritually-minded man.2. The lack of money for the work of preparation.Both these hindrances are fundamentally based on one and the same thing:materialism —one on the materialism of physical effort, and the other on that ofa world attitude.Let us keep these themes simple and down on the level at which most people workand think today; let us be intensely practical and force ourselves to look atconditions as they are, thus arriving at a better knowledge of ourselves and ofour motives.1. The Inertia of the Average Spiritually-Minded ManThe average aspirant, man of goodwill, or disciple, is constantly aware of thechallenge of the times and the opportunity which spiritual events may offer. Thedesire to do good and to accomplish spiritual ends is ceaselessly gnawing awaywithin his consciousness. No one who loves his fellowmen, who has a dream ofseeing the Kingdom of [620] God materialise on earth, or who is conscious of theawakening of the masses—slow though it may be—to the higher spiritual values,but is thoroughly dissatisfied. He realises that what he contributes of help tothese desirable objectives is little indeed. He knows that his spiritual life isa side issue; it is something which he keeps carefully to himself and which heis frequently afraid to mention to his nearest and his dearest; he tries todovetail his spiritual efforts into his ordinary outer life, struggling to findtime and opportunity for it in a gentle, futile and innocuous manner. He findshimself helpless before the task of organising and rearranging his affairs sothat the spiritual way of living may dominate; he searches for alibis forhimself and eventually rationalises himself so successfully that he ends bydeciding that he is doing the best he can in the given circumstances. The truthis that he is doing so little that probably one hour out of the twenty-four (orperhaps two) would cover the time given to the Master’s work; he hides behindthe alibi that his home obligations prevent his doing more, and he does notrealise that—given tact and loving understanding—his home environment can andmust be the field in which he triumphs; he forgets that there exist nocircumstances in which the spirit of man can be defeated or in which theaspirant cannot meditate, think, talk and prepare the way for the coming of theChrist, provided he cares enough and knows the meaning of sacrifice and silence.Circumstances and environment offer no true obstacle to the spiritual life .Perhaps he hides behind the alibi of poor health, and frequently behind that ofimaginary ills. He gives so much time to the care of himself that the hourswhich could be given to the Master’s work are directly and seriously curtailed;he is so preoccupied with feeling tired, or tending a cold, or with fanciedheart difficulties, that his “body consciousness” steadily develops until iteventually dominates his life; it is then too late to do anything. This isparticularly the case with people who have reached their fiftieth year or over;the trouble then is predominantly with women. It is [621] an alibi which it ishard not to use, for many feel tired and ailing and this, as the years go by, isapt to get worse. The only cure for the creeping inertia is to ignore the bodyand take your joy in the livingness of service. This leads to a longer life. Ispeak here not of definite disease or of serious physical liabilities; to theseright care and attention must be duly given; I speak to the thousands of ailingmen and women who are preoccupied with taking care of themselves, and so wastehours of the time which could be given to the service of humanity. I ask thosewho are seeking to tread the Path of Discipleship to release those many hoursspent in needless self-care into the service of the Hierarchy.Still another alibi leading to inertia is the fear people have of speaking aboutthe things of the Kingdom of God to others; they are afraid of being rebuffed,or of being thought peculiar, or of intruding. They therefore preserve silence,lose opportunity, and never discover how ready people are for the discussion ofrealities, for the comfort and hope which the thought of Christ’s return canbring, or for the sharing of spiritual light. This is essentially a form ofspiritual cowardice, but it is so widespread that it is responsible for the lossof millions of hours of world service.There are, brother of mine, other alibis, but the three above noted are the mostcommon; the release of the majority of aspirants from these hindering conditionswould bring to the service of the Christ (to use the language of the labourunion) so many man-hours and so much overtime endeavour that the task of thosewho admit no alibis would be greatly lightened and the coming of the Christwould be much nearer than it is today. What we call inertia is not simplypsychological in nature. The qualities of matter or substance itself areinvolved. Inertia is the slowest and the lowest aspect of material substance andis called in the Eastern philosophy, the quality of tamas. It has to betransmuted into a higher quality, that of activity or (giving it its technicalterm) its rajasic quality, and this leads later on to the highest quality ofrhythm or sattva. To the rhythm of life under which the Christ and the spiritualHierarchy operate, and which [622] vibrates in harmony with human need andhierarchical response, I call you not. I do, however, call you to demonstratethe quality of activity and to refuse to hide behind alibis. It is essentialthat all aspirants recognise that in the place where they now are, among thepeople who are their karmic associates, and with the psychological and physicalequipment with which they are endowed, they can and must work. I shall notlabour this subject. There is no possible coercion or undue pressure exerted inthe service of the Hierarchy. The situation is clear and simple. There are atthe present time three great activities going on:First, the activity to be felt in the “centre where the will of God is known,”that will-to-good which has carried all creation on toward a greater glory and asteadily deepening, intelligent responsiveness; this today is creativelyendeavouring to bring in the new world order, the order of the Kingdom of Godunder the physical supervision of the Christ. This might be regarded as theexternalisation of the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet. Of this, the return ofthe Christ to visible activity will be the sign and the symbol.Secondly, the critical activity which is conditioning the spiritual Hierarchy,from the Christ Himself down to the lowest aspirant to be found on the peripheryof that centre where the love of God has full play. There it is fully realisedthat (in the words of St. Paul) “the whole creation groaneth and travaileth inpain together until now, waiting for the manifestation of the Sons of God”. Itis for that manifestation that They now prepare, these “Sons of God Who are theSons of Men”; it is for this coming forth to outer active service that They arealready—one by one—entering into outer activity upon the physical plane. Theyare not recognised for what They are, but They go about the Father’s business,demonstrating goodwill, seeking to enlarge the horizon of humanity, and thusprepare the way for the One Whom They serve, the Christ, the Master of all theMasters and the Teacher alike of angels and of men.Thirdly, there is humanity itself, “the centre which we call the race of men”—acentre at present full of chaos, turmoil [623] and confusion, a humanity full ofpain, bewilderment, disturbance, yet mentally aware of infinite possibilities,emotionally fighting for that plan which seems to them to be the best, but withno sense of coherency or any realisation that it must be the one world for theone humanity. They desire simply emotional peace, security in which to live andwork, and a vision of a future which will satisfy some inchoate sense of divinepersistence. They are physically ill, deprived for the most part of theessentials of normal wholesome living, wracked with the sense of financialinsecurity and—consciously or unconsciously—invoking the Father of all on behalfof themselves and of the rest of the world.The solution is the return of the Christ. This is the ascertained will of God;it is the desire of Christ Himself and of His disciples, the Masters of theWisdom; it is the unrealised demand of men in all lands. Where there isunification of purpose, of spiritual intention and of realised need, then thereis only one thing which can arrest that return, and that is the failure ofmankind to prepare the stage for that stupendous event, to clear the highways,familiarise the people with the idea, and bring about the required measure ofpeace on Earth—a peace based upon right human relations.2. The Lack of Money for the Work of PreparationWe come now to the second of the major hindrances: the lack of financial supportfor the Christ’s workers and disciples in all lands as they endeavour to releasespiritual energy and bring a new order out of the present world chaos. This isperhaps the major difficulty, and it appears at times an insuperable one; itinvolves the problem of true financial trusteeship and the deflection ofadequate sums of money into channels which will definitely aid in the work ofpreparation for the return of the Christ. It is for this reason that I closedthe previous section of this article with the words “right human relations.”The problem is therefore a peculiarly hard one, for the [624] spiritual workersof the world have not only to train people to give according to the need andtheir means, but in many cases they have first of all to provide them with amotive so magnetic in its appeal that they must perforce give; they have also toprovide the trust, foundation and organisation through which the money given maybe administered. This presents them with a most impressively difficult task andone which is responsible for the present impasse. The impasse is not, however,based only on the novelty of raising funds in preparation for the return of theChrist, but it is based also on the trained selfishness of the majority of thosewho own the world’s wealth and who—even if they give—do so because it fostersprestige or indicates financial success. It must be remembered here that everygeneralisation presupposes exceptions.Generalising, and therefore over-simplifying the subject, we can assume thatmoney finds its way into four main channels of expenditures:1. Into the myriad homes of the world in the form of wages, salaries orinherited wealth. All this is at present most unevenly balanced, producingextreme riches and extreme poverty.2. Into great capitalistic systems and monopolies to be found as toweringstructures in most lands. Whether this capital is owned by the government, or bya municipality, or by a handful of wealthy men or by the great labour unionsmatters not. Little of it is yet spent in reality for the betterment of humanliving, or for the inculcation of the values which will lead to right humanrelations.3. Into the churches and religious groups throughout the world. Here (againspeaking in general terms and at the same time recognising the existence of asmall spiritually-minded minority) the money is deflected into the materialaspects of the work, into [625] the multiplying and preservation ofecclesiastical structures, into salaries and general overhead, and only apercentage of it really goes into the teaching of the people, into a livingdemonstration of the fact of His return—for centuries a definite doctrine of thechurches. That return has been anticipated down the ages, and might haveoccurred ere now had the churches and religious organisations everywhere donetheir duty.4. Into philanthropic, educational and medical work. All of this has beenexceedingly good and greatly needed, and the debt of the world to thepublic-spirited men who have made these institutions possible is great indeed.All of this has been a step in the right direction and an expression of thedivine will-to-good. It is, however, frequently money misused and misdirectedand the values developed have been largely institutional and concrete. They havebeen limited by the separative tenets of the donors or the religious prejudicesof those who control the disbursement of the funds. In the quarrelling overideas, religious theories and ideologies, the true assistance of the OneHumanity is overlooked.The fact remains that had the directing agencies through whose hands the moneyof the world is channelled any vision of the spiritual realities, of the onehumanity and the one world, and had their objective been the stimulation ofright human relations, the mass of men everywhere would be responding to avision very different from the present one; we would not be faced as we aretoday with the expenditures—running into countless billions—necessitated by theneed to restore physically , not only the physical bodies of countless millionsof men, but entire cities, transportation systems and centres responsible forthe reorganisation of human living.Equally, it can be said that if the spiritual values and the spiritualresponsibilities attached to money (in large [626] quantities or in small) hadbeen properly appreciated and taught in homes and schools, we would not have hadthe appalling statistics of the money spent, prior to the war in every countryin the world (and spent today in the Western Hemisphere), on candy, liquor,cigarettes, recreation, unnecessary clothes and luxuries. These statistics runinto hundreds of millions of dollars every year. A quota of this money,necessitating the minimum of sacrifice, would enable the disciples of the Christand the New Group of World Servers to prepare the way for His coming and toeducate the minds and hearts of men in every land in right human relations.Money—as with all else in human living—has been tainted by selfishness andgrabbed for selfish individual or national ends. Of this, the world war(1914-1945) is the proof, for although there was much talk of “saving the worldfor democracy” and “fighting a war to end war,” the main motive wasself-protection and self-preservation, the hope of gain, the satisfaction ofancient hatreds, and the regaining of territory. The two years which haveelapsed since the war have proved this to be so. The United Nations is occupiedwith rapacious demands from all sides, with the angling of the nations for placeand power, and for the possession of the natural resources of the Earth—coal,oil, etc., and also with the underground activities of the great Powers and ofthe capitalists which they all create.Yet all the time, the one humanity—no matter what the place of residence, whatthe colour of the skin, or what the religious beliefs—is clamouring for peace,justice and a sense of security. All this, the right use of money and arealisation on the part of many of their financial responsibility (aresponsibility based on the spiritual values) would rapidly give them. With theexception of a few great far-sighted philanthropists, and of a mere handful ofenlightened statesmen, churchmen and educators, this sense of financialresponsibility is to be found nowhere.The time has now come when money must be re-valued and its usefulness channelledinto new directions. The voice [627] of the people must prevail, but it must bea people educated in the true values, in the significances of a right culture,and in the need for right human relations. It is therefore essentially aquestion of right education and correct training in world citizenship—a thingthat has not yet been undertaken. Who can give this training? Russia wouldgladly train the world in the ideals of communism, and would gather all themoney in the world into the coffers of the proletariat, eventually producing thegreatest capitalistic system the world has ever seen. Great Britain would gladlytrain the world in the British concepts of justice and fair play and worldtrade, and would do it more cleverly than any other nation because of vastexperience. The United States would also gladly undertake to force the Americanbrand of democracy upon the world, using her vast capital and resources in sodoing, and gathering into her banks the financial results of her wide-spreadfinancial dealings, preserving them safely by the threat of the atomic bomb andthe shaking of the mailed fist over the rest of the world. France will keepEurope in a state of unrest as she seeks to regain her lost prestige and garnerall she can from the victory of the other allied nations. Thus, my brother, thestory goes—each nation fighting for itself and rating each other in terms ofresources and finance. In the meantime, humanity starves, remains uneducated, isbrought up on false values and the wrong use of money; until these things arebeing righted, the return of the Christ is not possible.In the face of this disturbing financial situation, what is the answer to theproblem? There are men and women to be found in every land, every government,every church and religion, and every educational foundation who have the answer.What hope is there for them and for the work with which they have beenentrusted? How can the people of the world, the men of goodwill and of spiritualvision help? Is there anything they can do to change the thinking of the worldin regard to money, and to deflect it into channels where it will be rightlyused? The answer lies within these people themselves.[628] There are two groups who can do much: those already using the financialresources of the world, if they will catch the new vision and also see thehandwriting on the wall which is bringing the old order down in destruction; andsecondly, the mass of the good, kindly people in all classes and spheres ofinfluence.The power of the little man and of the unimportant citizen is not yet trulygrasped, yet there is a vast opportunity before them if they have the courageand the patience to do the needed work.These men and women of goodwill and spiritual inclination must reject thethought of their relative uselessness, insignificance and futility, and realisethat now (in the critical and crucial moment that has come) they can workpotently. The Forces of Evil are defeated, though not yet “sealed” behind thedoor where humanity can put them and which the New Testament foretold wouldhappen. The world is in the balance again. Evil is seeking every avenueavailable for a new approach but—and this I say with confidence andinsistence—the little people of the world, enlightened and selfless in theirviewpoint, exist in sufficient numbers to make their power felt—if they will.There are millions of spiritually-minded men and women in every country who,when they come to the point of approaching in mass formation this question ofmoney, can permanently rechannel it. There are writers and thinkers in all landswho can add their powerful help, and who will if correctly approached. There areesoteric students and devoted church people to whom appeal can be made for aidin preparing the way for the return of the Christ, particularly if the aidrequired is the expenditure of money and time for the establishing of righthuman relations and the growth and spread of goodwill.A great campaign to raise money is not demanded, but the selfless work ofthousands of apparently unimportant people is required. I would say, mybrothers, that the most needed quality is courage ; it takes courage to putaside diffidence, shyness and the dislike of presenting a point of view,particularly a point of view connected with money. It is here [629] that themajority fail. It is relatively easy today to raise money for the Red Cross, forhospitals and for educational institutions. It is exceedingly difficult to raisemoney for the spread of goodwill, or to secure financial sources and the rightuse of money for forward looking ideas, such as the return of the Christ.Therefore I say that the first prerequisite is courage.The second requirement for the workers of the Christ is to make those sacrificesand arrangements which will enable them to give to the limit of their capacity;there must not be simply a trained ability to present the subject, but eachworker must practise what he preaches. If, for instance, the millions of peoplewho love the Christ and seek to serve His cause gave at least a tiny sum ofmoney each year, there would be adequate funds for His work; the needed trustsand the spiritually-minded trustees would then automatically appear. Thedifficulty is not with the organising of the money and work; it lies with theseeming inability of people to give. For one reason or another, they give littleor nothing, even when interested in such a cause as that of the return of theChrist; fear, or the love of purchasing, or the desire to give presents, orfailure to realise that many small sums mount up into very large sums—all thesethings militate against financial generosity, and the reason always seemsadequate. Therefore, the second prerequisite is for everyone to give as theycan.Thirdly, the metaphysical schools and the esoteric groups have given muchthought to this business of directing money into channels which appeal to them.The question is often asked: Why do the Unity School of thought, the ChristianScience Church, and many New Thought movements always manage to accumulate therequired funds, whilst other groups, and particularly the esoteric groups, donot? Why do truly spiritual workers seem unable to materialise what they need?The answer is a simple one. Those groups and workers who are the closest to thespiritual ideal are as a house divided against itself. Their main interest is onabstract spiritual levels, and they have not apparently grasped the fact thatthe physical plane, when motivated from the spiritual levels, is of equalimportance. The large metaphysical [630] schools are focussed on making amaterial demonstration, and so great is their emphasis and so one-pointed istheir approach that they get what they demand; they have to learn that thedemand and its answer must be the result of spiritual purpose, and that thatwhich is demanded must not be for the use of the separated self or for aseparative organisation or church. In the new age which is upon us, prior to thereturn of the Christ, the demand for financial support must be for the bringingabout of right human relations and goodwill, and not for the growth of anyparticular organisation. The organisations so demanding must work with theminimum of overhead and central plant, and the workers for the minimum yetreasonable salary. Not many such organisations exist today, but the few nowfunctioning can set an example which will be rapidly followed, as the desire forthe return of the Christ grows. Therefore the third prerequisite is the serviceof the one humanity.The fourth prerequisite must be the careful presentation of the cause for whichthe financial support is required. People may have the courage to speak, but anintelligent presentation is of equal importance. The major point to beemphasised in the preparatory work for the return of Christ is the establishingof right human relations. This has already been started by men of goodwill allover the world, under their many names, and here I have done naught but indicateanother motive for presentation.We come now to the fifth prerequisite : a vital and sure belief in humanity as awhole. There must be no pessimism as to the future of mankind or distress overthe disappearance of the old order. The good, the true and the beautiful is onits way, and for it mankind is responsible, and not some outer divineintervention. Humanity is sound and rapidly awakening. We are passing throughthe stage where everything is being proclaimed from the housetops—as the Christstated would be the case—and as we listen or read of the flood of filth, crime,sensual pleasure or luxury buying, we are apt to be discouraged; it is wise toremember that it is wholesome for all this to come to the surface and for us allto know about [631] it. It is like the psychological cleansing of thesubconscious to which individuals submit themselves, and it presages theinauguration of a new and better day.There is work to do, and the men of goodwill, of spiritual instinct, and oftruly Christian training must do it. They must inaugurate the era of the use ofmoney for the spiritual Hierarchy, and carry that need into the realms ofinvocation. Invocation is the highest type of prayer there is, and a new form ofdivine appeal which a knowledge of meditation has now made possible. To this endI will give you a short form of spiritual demand which I would ask you all touse in the place of any prayer, meditation or invocation for money which you mayhave hitherto used. It is short and powerful, but requires a unified group or atruly integrated personality to use it. . . .I have naught to add in the way of an appeal for funds, courage orunderstanding. If the courage of the Christ, as He faces return to this physicalouter world, if the need of humanity for right human relations, and thesacrificing work of the disciples of the Christ are not enough to fire you andto energise you and those whom you can reach, there is nothing that I can saywhich will be of any use.WORK IN THE COMING DECADESApril 1948This is the last Wesak Message which I intend to give you. In 1949, I shall havecompleted thirty years of carefully planned and meticulously outlined work; thiswork I undertook under cyclic law (related to the periodical giving out of theesoteric teaching) in order to aid humanity and the work of the Hierarchy, toboth of which I happen to belong.On November 19th, 1919, I made my first contact with A.A.B. (much to herdistress and dismay), and I have worked steadily with her ever since. The bookswhich I then planned have been well-nigh finished; the various phases of thework which were a part of the preparation for the reappearance of [632] theChrist have taken form and should go forward with gathering momentum during thenext twenty years.The two major ideas which it was my task to bring to the attention of humanityeverywhere throughout the world have been securely anchored (if I may bepermitted to use such a term), and these constitute by far the most importantaspect of the work which I have done. These formulated ideas are:1. The announcement of the existence (hitherto unrecognised) of the New Group ofWorld Servers. This is an effective group of workers, intermediate betweenHumanity and the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet.2. The statement, sent out lately, in connection with the Reappearance of theChrist, and for the immediate consolidation of the work of preparation.All else that I have done in the service of the Hierarchy is of secondaryimportance to these two statements of spiritual fact .The fifth volume of A Treatise on the Seven Rays remains to be finished, as doesthe second volume of Discipleship in the New Age; there is nothing else; whatremains, therefore, can easily be accomplished before my term of thirty yearscomes to an end. Other work awaits me under the reorganisation of all thehierarchical efforts incident to the reappearance of the Christ and the closerrelationship which will then be established between humanity and the Hierarchy.The work of hierarchical reorganisation is at present largely internal andconcerns not humanity at this time.I have made it entirely clear to all of you what is the work which you should doand I have no intention (in this final message) of pleading with you to doit—beyond asking you to carry on where I leave off . I refer of course to myexoteric work.That the work which I am now doing was definitely ending [633] in 1949 was quiteunknown to A.A.B. and has no relation whatsoever to the fact that her health isprecarious. It has, however, some relation to the fact that she has resumed moreactive work as a disciple in the Ashram of her own Master, after twenty-eightyears of service in mine. Before I began the work of the past three decades, Iknew exactly the time I had in which to bring about the results desired by theHierarchy; all has been meticulously carried out under a most clearly visionedplan.First, there was the necessity to find the nucleus of people through whom I hadto work; the first step was therefore the writing of certain books which wouldcarry the new teaching, and act therefore as a selective agent for the discoveryof those who would work in the new emerging cycle.The starting of the Arcane School by A.A.B. was only incidental to thisobjective; its aim is to train those disciples who can implement the Plan andthus prepare for the reappearance of the Christ; the Arcane School can thereforeprovide a trained body of workers.Ten years after that, I began to expand the range of contacts, and the teachingbegan to reach thinkers on continents other than the American. As a result, Ibegan to form my own Ashram and to find people in all countries who weredisciples, qualified as such, but who needed the impact of the influence of asecond ray Ashram. When this was done, the major part of the second decade of mywork became possible, and I therefore wrote a pamphlet entitled The New Group ofWorld Servers. In it I called attention to the fact that there existed upon theEarth, in every nation, men and women who (in some form or another) recognisedthe spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, who had a quality of non-separateness,definitely present or else rapidly developing, and who were gathered together inno limiting organisation but primarily by their trend of thought and the habitof their activity. They constituted a group who were subjectively, spiritually,practically and openly creating a new form of human relationship. This newrelation resulted in mutual understanding and a mental cooperation whichrecognised [634] no barriers or national limitations. On the inner side ofspiritual incentive and endeavour, they work today as one group; on the outerside of world affairs, they may not be aware of each other physically, or arriveat any open contact, yet they are animated by the same principles and arecarrying forward—in all nations and in every great department of human thinkingand planning—a similar work.In this decade of my work, two major activities were inaugurated: the creationof the Triangles and the formation of Men of Goodwill, (Since 1951 this work hasbeen carried forward under the title of World Goodwill.) and these are just onthe verge of a major creative activity. They constitute an effort to energiseand relate members and adherents of the New Group of World Servers (andparticularly in the organisation of men of goodwill), to find and mobilise thegroups formed by the New Group of World Servers throughout the world, so as tobring added strength to all of them by swinging into a massed effort men ofprayer, men of good intention, and those who believe in the divine will-to-good,plus those who implement it through love—no matter what they mean by that vagueterm. Thus a nucleus of a great synthesis was brought about in this seconddecade, and it will have lasting effects upon human living and design. Owing toplanetary frustration and the enhanced activity of the Forces of Evil, the workof the Triangles and of the men of goodwill has been more slowly formulated thanhad been originally expected, but this has been through no fault of theirs; thisperiod of frustration will be over before very long and a greatly increasedmomentum will be the result. For this increased response upon the part of thepublic, you should now lay your plans.In the third and final decade of my work, the time and opportunity came toannounce, in a new and more emphatic manner, what all the world religions haveproclaimed, that—with due preparation and the establishment of a pronouncedtendency towards right human relations—the time had come when the Christ couldagain appear and take His rightful place as World Teacher. The emphasis hasnever before been [635] laid upon the needed work of preparation. The results ofthis pronouncement have not yet had time to make themselves felt, but the nextten years will reveal the full import of what has been done.With that pronouncement my planned work was brought to a finish; the book (TheReappearance of the Christ.) which will indicate the proximity of this happeningand the lines along which the new world religion will be promoted is now in thepress. I would call your attention to the fact that the general concept of aWorld Saviour (always attached to the office of the Christ, no matter by whatname the exalted Son of God may be called in any world cycle) is in realityclosely related to the far more important function of World Teacher. People loveto be saved, for it ignores their own immediate responsibility, which teachingdefinitely emphasises. It must be remembered that it is the teaching given bythe Christ which saves humanity—not any symbolic death upon a cross. Men mustsave themselves by their reaction and their response to the teaching given inits purity by the Christ; this is a point which should be forcefully instilledby all of you; it is not man-made interpretations which save a man, but hisself-initiated application of his own understanding of the teaching. This mustbe brought today to the consciousness of as many human beings as the followersof the Christ can reach.Here you have a brief account of the work which I undertook on behalf of theHierarchy and for the Christ, Whom I most reverently regard as my Master. Thiswork has not been unsuccessfully carried forward; many of you who read thesewords have done what you could to help and of this I am not unmindful nor is theHierarchy ungrateful. Perhaps—with a still clearer picture in your minds—youwill find yourselves able to do still more.I intend to indicate (still briefly) what should be done in the next twodecades, but would like first of all to touch upon the state of the world andrefer to its condition, because they have both handicapped hierarchical effortand particularly what I sought to do (which was a major hierarchical [636]enterprise), and yet at the same time they have cleared the way in a mostextra-ordinary manner for the appearance of the Christ.When I began my exoteric work in 1919, I had not expected to be frustrated bythe second world war, or rather by the final phase of World War I. The Hierarchyhad hoped that the lesson had been severe enough to force those changes whichwere essential to the future of mankind. But humanity had not learned the neededlessons. As I have often told you, the Hierarchy—because of the divine principleof free will in humanity—cannot foretell how men will act in times of crisis;the Hierarchy cannot enforce the good way of life against normal human desire,for this good way of action must come from out the very depths of human thinkingand feeling, and must emerge as a free and non-supervised endeavour; theHierarchy may not take those possible steps which will prevent men makingmistakes, for it is through those mistakes that men learn “by the means of evilthat good is best,” as your great initiate-poet has expressed it. All that theHierarchy can do is to present the needed teaching which will direct man’sthinking along right lines, to point the way of true relationships, and at thesame time demonstrate objectively the nature of the bad way. This the Hierarchyhas always done. As a spiritual group, They can and do set Their faces againstselfishness, greed, and against all that seeks to imprison the human spirit andimpair its freedom. To illustrate—the Hierarchy demonstrated against thetotalitarianism which the two great Powers, Germany and Japan expressed whenthey precipitated the second world war. This They still do and will continue todo when any aspect of totalitarian greed and aggressiveness in any form (subtleand undeclared or openly demonstrated) attempts to limit the freedom of theindividual, the free spiritual man, no matter what his point in evolution.Toward the end of the second decade of my work, totalitarianism reared anew itsmost evil head, and perforce, the Hierarchy took sides against this primaryprinciple of evil, though never against any group of human beings. Please [637]note this. The point I seek to make is that the Hierarchy is inflexibly againstany demonstration of the principle of non- freedom, no matter what form ittakes, but is ever on the side of humanity. The spirit of evil which animatedGerman actions evoked every possible opposition from the Forces of Light andfrom their source, the Hierarchy. Today this totalitarian evil is expressingitself through the planning of the Russian oligarchy, through the Zionistmovement, and through all groups which seek to fetter and imprison the spirit ofman; but the people under the sway of this evil influence and the scheming ofthese evil groups are never regarded in any light different to that of the restof mankind. They are looked upon as glamoured, or as weak and ignorant (whichthey undoubtedly are), but they are never separated off in the thinking andplanning of the Hierarchy from the rest of mankind. The evil must not bepermitted or allowed to triumph, but the unhappy and glamoured exponents of thisevil are loved, along with the rest of mankind. This is a point which is hardfor the illogical thinker to understand, but it expresses most truly theattitude of the Christ and of all who serve His cause.With the focussed entrance of greed and of totalitarian ruthlessness into theworld arena, much that I had planned and much that all of you were attempting todo, met with frustration; the work of all disciples was in many ways greatlyhindered and handicapped, though not from the long range vision, but only fromthe angle of short range action. I would ask you to have this in mind. Thevision stands even when immediate action is blocked.Today it would appear, from all the indications and from the dominant worldtrends, that the still unconquered greed of certain of the more powerful nationsis undeniably rampant, and that we are therefore facing another period offrustration and of major world difficulty. Feeling against Russia is runninghigh among the Western Powers and is largely her own fault, though it isprimarily based upon two main factors—one of them bad and the other good.The bad reaction is based on the same old triplicity of [638] fear, greed andjealousy and—from the angle of those three phases of selfishness—is entirelyjustified. That fact, in itself, supplies a major difficulty. Think this out.The good reaction is based on the frustration of the idea or concept ofdeveloping a unified peaceful world—a world in which there would be no war andin which men could live at peace with each other and in security, and in whichmen everywhere could work, relatively unopposed, towards right human relations.This super-world and this unified humanity is a true ideal, but is not afeasible project.Spiritual workers should face the various world alternatives:1. An all-dominant Russia, whose regime would cover the planet, enforcing hertotalitarian interpretation of communistic doctrine (there is a right and trueinterpretation), refusing freedom to the individual in the interest of theState, and—because of a low opinion of the human masses—everywhere standardisingher interpretation of democracy.2. A world in which all nations live in an armed armistice, in which distrust isforever rampant and in which science is prostituted to the art of destruction.In this world an explosion must and will eventually take place which willdestroy humanity as once before it was destroyed, according to the Bible and theother world Scriptures and the hierarchical records.3. A world in which the United States proves itself to be the controllingfactor, after wiping out Russia, which she can well do if she acts now. It willbe a predominantly capitalistic world, run by several nations but headed by theUnited States. A capitalistic nation is not necessarily wrong; capital has itsplace, and Russia (the enemy of capitalism) is by no means free fromcapitalistic bias. The motives of the United States are very mixed motives:greed of money or its equivalent, such as oil, and at the same time sincerelygood intentions for the establishment of human freedom in a democraticworld—modelled, of course, on American democracy. Other motives are anappreciation of the armed fist and, at [639] the same time, a longing foreconomic sharing and for that essential kindness which is such a strong Americancharacteristic—a mass characteristic. These mixed motives will produceeventually a very confused world, one in which it will be found that humanityhas learned very little as the result of the World War (1914-1945) and isacquiescent to the cycle of well-intentioned money control.4. A world divided into “blocs” for mutual aid and economic sharing. Of this,the proposed treaty between Great Britain, France and the Benelux countries is atentative sample, though tainted by objectionable motives, from the angle of theHierarchy. Fear is the major factor producing this treaty, but it has in itnevertheless the seeds of hope. There is nothing intrinsically wrong in anygroup of nations standing together for mutual aid and economic cooperation. Thewrong factor comes in when they stand united against any other group of nations,and therefore against any group of human beings. It is this attitude, engineeredand fostered by Russia, which has lead to the relatively new concept of blocsagainst . Along this line, and with this attitude of antagonistic groupings,only disaster can lie.Blocs in themselves can be good and proper if they follow lines of naturalcleavages, of language differences and of cultural distinctions. They can beessentially right if they are formed for economic, educational, religious andsocial aims and can therefore provide no true cause for alarm. Such blocs wouldbe cultural and not militaristic, economic and not greedy, and they couldprovide a normal and progressive movement away from the separative nationalismof the past and towards the distant creation of the One World, and the OneHumanity. This will some day be seen, but the time is not yet. Mankind is notready for some super-government, nor can it yet provide the unselfish andtrained statesmen that such a government would require. As yet, there are moreseeds of danger in this concept than there are of helpfulness. Nevertheless, itis a dream which will some day materialise, after the creation and thefunctioning of blocs have proved how men should work and live together.[640] The United Nations is still the hope of the world and can remain so; it isa great field of experimentation, but is suffering today from an initial error.That error was the admitting of a totalitarian Power into its nations. For sevenlong and terrible years the Forces of Light had been fighting totalitarianism.In the early days of the post-war period the Nations compromised with principlesand admitted Russia to the United Nations. Had they proceeded to unite all theother nations of the world on the sure ground of economic reform, of needednational reorganisation and of regional groups (a better term than “blocs”),Russia would have been forced to conform, for her very existence would have beenat stake. An initial error can lead to much trouble, and it is this type oftrouble which the United Nations today faces.I have here given you the possibilities with which the work is challenged andconfronted, and again I must refuse to foretell what will happen. It is notpermitted. I have felt it necessary to summarise the situation because it is inthis world that you and all men of goodwill will have to work for the nexttwenty years; this period of settlement will not be an easy one in which thedisciples of the Christ have to prepare for His appearance. The two decadesahead of you are those in which you must bring to fruition the seeds which Ihave planted. Though I shall not be actively and outwardly working with you orcommunicating with you as I have done over the past thirty years, you will havemy books (which will then be finished) and the relation which I now hold to youand to all the activities which I have helped you to inaugurate will remainbasically the same; it will be more subjective but many in the world today knowthe means of reaching me.The Christ, Whom I serve as a disciple, and the spiritual Hierarchy, of which Iam a member, are drawing steadily nearer to humanity; in the past I have usedthe statement to reassure you, “The Hierarchy stands”; today I say to you, “TheHierarchy is near.”The work that must be done in the two coming decades is as follows, and I shallnot enlarge upon it because you have [641] been trained to do it; you know whatto do and the responsibility is yours—as will be my unfailing help.1. Prepare men for the reappearance of the Christ. This is your first andgreatest duty. The most important part of that work is teaching men—on a largescale—to use the Invocation so that it becomes a world prayer and focusses theinvocative demand of humanity.2. Enlarge the work of the Triangles so that, subjectively and etherically,light and goodwill may envelop the earth.3. Promote ceaselessly the work of World Goodwill, so that every nation may haveits group of men and women dedicated to the establishing of right humanrelations. You have the nucleus, and expansion must be undertaken. You have theprinciple of goodwill present throughout the world; the task will be heavyindeed but far from impossible.4. Undertake the constant distribution of my books, which contain much of theteaching for the New Age. In the last analysis, the books are your working toolsand the instruments whereby you will train your workers. See that they are keptin steady circulation.5. Endeavour to make the Wesak Festival (at the time of the May Full Moon) auniversal festival and known to be of value to all men of all faiths. It is thefestival in which the two divine Leaders, of the East and of the West,collaborate together and work in the closest spiritual union; the Christ and theBuddha use this festival each year as the point of inspiration for the comingyear’s work. See that you do likewise. The spiritual energies are then uniquelyavailable.6. Discover the members of the New Group of World Servers, whenever possible,and strengthen their hands. Look for them in every nation and expressing manylines of thought and points of view. Remember always that in doctrine and dogma,and in techniques and methods, they may differ widely from you, but in love oftheir fellowmen, in practical goodwill and in devotion to the establishing ofright human relations they stand with you, they are your equals, and canprobably teach you much.[642] And now: What shall I say to you in closing, my comrades, my brothers andmy co-disciples? I have said to you so much over the past years that there islittle left to say; you have all you need wherewith to carry on the work,impulsed from the Hierarchy, through what I have attempted to do. I can only saythat I have confidence in you and that I expect no slackening of effort fromyou. You are dedicated and consecrated and will remain so, for the closeness ofthe Hierarchy and the nearness of the Christ indicate to you increased sourcesof strength.May the blessing of the One Whom we all serve rest upon you all and upon alldisciples everywhere, and may you do your full share in helping men to pass fromdarkness into light and from death to immortality.THE ASHRAMS CONCERNED AT THE COMINGJune 1948The Full Moon is upon us and the thoughts of the world (to a far larger extentthan you realise) are directed towards the Christ. It is upon His concerns thatI speak to you today, inextricably bound up, as they are, with the concerns ofhumanity, and this by His Own choice. Many today in all lands are turning theirthoughts consciously to Him; others are aware of a vague turning towards somedivine Person or Power Who must and should help mankind in its hour of need.There is a rising, an ascension of the spirit of man everywhere which is betterknown to us than to you, whose values and reactions are not so spiritual. Thestrength, the power and the special energies which He received at that dramaticmoment when He, the Buddha and the Lord of the World created a Triangle of Lightat the time of the Wesak Festival, will be released by Him at the hour of theFull Moon of June. This Light has been concentrated upon the “centre which wecall the race of men,” but it has not yet been released. At the Full Moon itwill be poured out all over the Earth. During the interim between reception anddistribution, [643] it has been transformed into the energy of goodwill and intothat light which will illumine the minds of men.The Great Invocation—now being used by so many—has greatly facilitated thereceptivity of men; the creative appearance of effective goodwill can, however,be some time in manifesting. Nevertheless, nothing can arrest its subtle workingand its eventual widespread appearance, on a scale great enough to be effectivethroughout the whole world. This greatly to be desired expression of divinepurpose will be fulfilled if humanity (as a whole) stands in steady expectancy,wise activity, and makes broad and brotherly decisions. As I have often toldyou, the final decisions in world affairs have to be made through mankind’sdeliberate choice; no compulsion is ever exerted by the Hierarchy or by thedisciples of the Christ to force men to take some desirable action. Man’s freewill must be preserved. In an unique manner, men are today facing a period ofthe freeing of the human soul, or a period of its imprisonment indefinitely; theright decision will lead to the Kingdom of God, and the other to a retrogressionwhich will deify the past and prolong past wrong action.This outpouring of spiritual energy passes through the groups or (to use atechnical word which is relatively unimportant) through the Ashrams of all theMasters of the Wisdom, the Disciples of the Christ. It is then transformed ortransmuted by them so as to meet adequately the needs of the different types ofpeople who compose humanity and who are represented in the Ashrams by differentMasters. Through all the Masters and through all disciples this energy passes,so that all—at their many different stages—may receive the needed stimulation.They precipitate certain specialised aspects of this newly received energy, andthey therefore will be peculiarly active in the coming period.Five of the Masters and Their five Ashrams are primarily involved in thispreparatory work. There is first of all the Ashram of the Master K.H., which isthe presiding Ashram in this work, owing to the fact that it is a second rayAshram, and therefore upon the same line of spiritual energy and descent as theChrist Himself. Another reason is that the [644] Master K.H. will assume therole of World Teacher in the distant future when the Christ moves on to higherand more important work than dealing with the consciousness of humanity. Nextcomes the Master Morya and His Ashram, because the whole procedure is projectedfrom Shamballa, and He is in close touch with that dynamic centre. The MasterR., as the Lord of Civilisation, is necessarily closely involved in thispreparatory work, and also because He is what has been called the Regent ofEurope. Another Ashram is also very deeply concerned in this work; I have, attimes, referred to the Master Who was responsible for the organisation ofLabour. This work He began to do in the latter part of the nineteenth century,but left it to carry forward of its own momentum when Russia entered the fieldand laid an undue emphasis upon the proletariat during the revolution and in thelater years of the first quarter of the twentieth century. I (D.K.) am the fifthMaster concerned in this special work and am, as it were, the liaison officerbetween those active and conscious disciples who are working in the world ofouter affairs and those directly responsible to the Christ for the desired workof preparation. Certain disciples from these five Ashrams or groups have been(and will be) especially trained for the work of contacting the public.The stimulation which can be given will be released at the coming Full Moon. Thefive specialised energies are as follows:1. The Energy of Love-Wisdom. This energy always has an effect upon every typeof human being in the world. Its effect is to stimulate the tendency towardsgoodwill and to produce a mental development which can transmute theknowledge—garnered down the ages—into wisdom. It is wisdom which is neededtoday. Those who are now attempting to foster goodwill in themselves and otherswill be stimulated into wise action. You can see, therefore, that the outpouringof this energy is the first and greatest need. It can reach mankind because theFounders of all the world religions (I refer not to their many diversifications)are banded together in [645] unison with the Christ, Their Lord and Master;through Their united and directed effort, these energies will flow. Forget notthat Christ represents the energy of love and the Buddha that of wisdom.2. The Energy of Will or Power. The outpouring of this energy, owing to the“little wills” of the majority of men and the developed strenuous wills ofcertain present world Leaders, will not have as wide or potent an effect orcontact as may the others. Its inflow will, however, serve to bring about a“fixed intention” on the part of many to work ceaselessly for true peace andunderstanding. These people will therefore aid in the task of implementinggoodwill. It will, nevertheless, strengthen the will of the selfish, ambitiousand obstinate men who are in positions of power and influence, and produceincreased trouble—at least temporarily. The salvation of the world and theproduction of the needed security will be brought about in the long run by themass of men everywhere, in all lands; it will be the result of an intensifiededucational process. Humanity, as yet, does not know how to handle wisely theenergy of the will-to-power, and it is largely this that has handicapped themanifestation of the will-to-good. The Shamballa force is too strong for thosewho are naturally wilful. In the case of certain potent men, this energy reachesthem directly, and is not stepped down for them through contact with theHierarchy of Love; it naturally expresses itself in the political fields and inthe realm of governments, through rulers, officials, statesmen and politicians.When the “little wills” of the intelligentsia, of those who serve the public insome capacity or other, and those above all who are working in some connectionwith the United Nations, become strengthened, stimulated and focussed ongoodwill, the union of the two energies of Love-Wisdom and of Will can bringabout the needed changes in the planetary life. This is not an immediatehappening, but it is not a visioning of the impossible.3. The Energy of Active Intelligence. This third type of energy is the easiestone for modern humanity to receive—which is perhaps a sad commentary upon man’saspirations. [646] The proof of this lies in the fact that much of this type ofenergy (through the selfish perception and desires of mankind) has beencrystallised into money. Human intelligence has served on the side ofmaterialism and not on the side of the spiritual values. Money is theconcretised expression of the third type of spiritual energy. This particularexpression appeared first in the ancient and equally materialistic system ofbarter and exchange; then, in later civilisations (predominantly including ours)we have the appearance of money, made first from the products of the mineralkingdom, and then later came paper money, made from the products of thevegetable kingdom. This has culminated in the modern preoccupation with money.There is very deep occult meaning to be found in the statement in the NewTestament that “the love of money is the root of all evil”. It is largely moneyand selfishness which lie behind the present disastrous economic situation.Great financiers are in reality those in whom the receipt of money, or of thistype of energy, constitutes the line of least resistance, plus the will to makevast fortunes, which cannot be gainsaid. They will to make a fortune; they bringtheir intelligence to bear upon their goal, and naught can stop them. Many ofthem are purely selfish; some regard their money as a trust to be used forothers and are amazingly generous in a philanthropic and humanitarian sense.These men are receptive to the first type of energy, and frequently all thethree types find a channel through them, and the world is greatly benefited;such men are nevertheless very rare. It still remains for the crystallisedaspect of this third energy—money—to be used on a large scale for thefurtherance of the work of the Hierarchy. It is at this point and in connectionwith money that the great test of goodwill should demonstrate.4. The energy which produces order. This is the energy of the seventh ray orpower of divinity. At this time, its major expression will come through therelationships and adjustments required between capital and labour, and labourwill be primarily involved. This energy is being assimilated in the Ashram ofthe Master Whom I mentioned above; at the [647] inception of the industrial eraHe was responsible for the formation of the labour movement—a movement bringinginto relation the workers of the world. It is interesting to have in mind thattoday labour functions internationally; it is a group which learns with rapidityand has in it the seeds of vast good; it is probably the group which will placegoodwill in the forefront of human thinking—upon a pinnacle of thought. ThisMaster to Whom I refer belongs to the Ashram of the Master R. He relieves Him ofthis phase of the work to be done.5. The energy of right human relations. This energy is a subsidiary expressionof the energy of Love-Wisdom—the first of the great outpouring energies. Itemanates, therefore, from the subsidiary Ashram for which I am responsible. Ihave written and taught much about it, and with some success. “Right humanrelations” is not simply goodwill, as people seem to think; it is a product orresult of goodwill and the instigator of constructive changes betweenindividuals, communities and nations. About it I need not write, for you haveenough teaching from me to guide you. Your daily actions will be those ofgoodwill, directed towards the establishing of right human relations if you arerightly oriented within the race of men and towards the spiritual Hierarchy.These energies—along with others at this time far less potent and therefore ofonly secondary importance—will greatly stimulate the hearts and minds of men. Itis the task of the Members of the Hierarchy to distribute these energies (oncethey are released by the Christ) to the working disciples on the physical planeand to the myriad aspirants in training for discipleship and to the members ofthe New Group of World Servers. Members of the New Group of World Serversconsist of those who are completely dedicated to the service of humanity and tothe establishing of right human relations under hierarchical impression;aspirants and quite a few disciples have diversified interests and only servepart time. To all these groups is committed the task of implementing the workand directing the energies for which the Christ is responsible. The objectivesof the Hierarchy in this [648] divine act of massed impression and stimulationare briefly three, as follows:1. To bring about those conditions which will make the coming of the Christpossible. The blended influence of these energies will bring about what may atfirst appear to be undesirable results, because the remaining opposition of theForces of Evil is still active and must be overcome; this may necessitatedrastic measures, but great good will eventually appear.2. To prepare the minds of men so that they may be ready for the influence ofthe Avatar about Whom the Scriptures speak. He is called the Avatar of Synthesisand His influence will be spread through the work and the activity of theChrist.It must be remembered that synthesis is an aspect of the first divinecharacteristic, the Will, or rather, the Will-to-Good. This energy or influence,which the Christ Himself will wield (and for which He has been long preparingHimself), produces cohesion, a drawing together and a tendency to fusion andunion. The separateness of humanity, and its selfishness, had reached such vastproportions, and its effects were so completely dominated by the Forces of Evil,that—in response to the massed inchoate demand of humanity—the Hierarchy calledfor spiritual interposition. The endless selfish propaganda, in speech or inwriting, most of it materialistic, nationalistic and basically untrue andwrongly motivated, became such a clamour that it reached to spheres usuallyimpervious to the sounds of earth; the Avatar of Synthesis was called in to aid.The main objective and the immediate task of the Christ is to bring to an endthe separateness which exists between man and man, family and family, communityand community, and nation and nation. This is a simple statement, and one thatcan be understood easily by the most ignorant; it is simple also in that itprovides a practical objective and task [649] for the smallest and the mostunimportant of the sons of men; all can cooperate if they will. It isnevertheless a task which has required the mobilising of the entire planetaryHierarchy, and the assistance also of a great Being Who would normally work onlevels of consciousness higher than those on which Christ and His discipleslabour.3. To stimulate the aspiration in the hearts of men so that human receptivity tothe good, the beautiful and the true may be greatly increased. These energieswill bring in the new creative era, which will sweep into expression as soon asworld tension has subsided; then men will be free to think and to create the newforms for the new ideals; then they will bring into manifestation in words, incolour, in music and in sculptured forms the new revelation and the new worldwhich the coming of Christ will inaugurate.It will be obvious (if you have considered my words with care) that a greatspiritual movement is under way—perhaps the greatest of all time, if we exceptthe great spiritual crisis which brought the fourth kingdom into being, thehuman kingdom. I have mentioned above only three of the most important resultsfor which the Hierarchy hopes. Humanity is deemed to have reached a point inevolution where much can be done, because the minds of men—for the first time ona worldwide scale—are sensitive to spiritual impression; the opportunity of themoment is unique, because minds everywhere are showing themselves superlativelyreceptive to both good and evil. Men are not today governed so much by blindimpulse as by considered thought. There have always been small groups and raresouls who have demonstrated the capacity to respond to spiritual impression. Theline of least resistance for the masses is the selfish impulse, and there liesthe major point of attack by the Forces of Light.The totalitarian powers have always realised and exploited this capacity ofhuman beings to be responsive to [650] good or bad impression. By impressingcertain doctrines, certain principles and certain beliefs on their people, andby withholding the truth or the facts and ignoring the realities, they contriveto swing their people into an acceptance which means—for the controllinginitiators—immense power.Other nations, the so-called democracies, are in a state of great confusion,split into political, religious and social parties, listening to the teaching,the dreams and the plans of every person who has an idea and thrusts himselfforward into the public consciousness, having no true or good policy, tainted byselfishness (personal or national, and sometimes both), and demanding thesettlement of material affairs with small attention—if any—to the recognisedspiritual goals and values.There is fortunately a growing body of those of all faiths, or of no religiousfaith, to be found in every continent and nation who are aware of the stirringof this spiritual movement—linking humanity and the Hierarchy. This is due totheir reaction to spiritual hope, to the expectancy and to the curiouslywidespread belief that divine intervention is possible and at hand. As themomentum of this spiritual activity develops, so will the responsiveness amongmen develop, and if the reaction is that which is hoped for, it will be themasses everywhere who will slowly unite to bring about the conditions needed forthe reappearance of the Prince of Peace, bringing with Him the potency and thebenediction of the Avatar of Synthesis. The number of these semi-enlightenedpeople is growing fast; desperation is hastening their response to help from onhigh, and in due time their numbers will be so great that totalitarianism, aswell as chaotic democracy, will not be able to stand against them.This is no mystical or visionary dream with which I am presenting you. Itinvolves hard business sense on the physical plane, a practical commonsense, acessation of the constant presentation of a beautiful future in a mythicalheaven of idleness and uselessness. The bringing in of the Kingdom of God, thepreparation for the coming of the Christ and the salvaging of mankind demandcourage, organisation, [651] business acumen, psychology and persistence; itneeds trained workers and much money; it calls for carefully consideredprogrammes, possessing long range vision, plus sensible modern procedures. It isto this that all with true vision and a love of humanity are called today; itmeans the spreading of an intelligently cultivated goodwill and the fostering ofthose conditions, attitudes and points of view which will inevitably bring aboutright human relations.I would call your careful attention to one most important matter. The momentthat a point of balance is reached, the moment that those who stand forseparateness and materialism, for totalitarianism or for any imposed regime (andconsequently an evil unity), and those who stand for the freedom of the humansoul, for the rights of the individual, for brotherhood and right humanrelations, are equal in force, in position and in influence, then the doors ofthe Hierarchy (symbolically speaking) will open, and the Christ with Hisdisciples will come. This balance has to reach a point upon mental levels; ithas to be reached by those who can think, who can influence, and in whose handslies the responsibility for what the masses below the mental level know andbelieve. The unskilled labourer, the numerous people who never think, who areonly young in the experience of incarnation, and the multitudes who evadethought even when they are capable of it, lie in the hands of two vast anddominant groups: the totalitarians and the democracies.The consequences of attaining a point of balance are very close today. Organisedevil is not in power; organised good is still quite ineffective, largely owingto the failure of the religions of the world to give a true picture of Christ’smission; therefore the struggle for control is with us now . If the forces ofevil, plus the groups of men who seek control of the human spirit (no matter inwhat country they are found, and they can be found in every single countrywithout exception), become dominant, the doors of evil will open and the life ofman will lose its meaning; death will settle down upon our planet—death bothspiritual and [652] mental. If the forces of good, the work of the New Group ofWorld Servers, and the activities of men of goodwill everywhere prevail, thedoors of the spiritual Hierarchy will open and—to use a Biblical phrase—theHosts of the Lord will issue forth. The Christ Will Come .ORGANISING THE ASHRAMS INTO FORM ON EARTHJune 1949I would ask you, at the time of this Full Moon of June to spend a little time invisualising the situation which is likely to come about on Earth if and when (asa result of the preparatory work done by and for humanity), the Hierarchy isexternalised or manifests itself as a definite and recognised organisation uponthe physical plane. What will happen in the world if and when the Masters of theWisdom function objectively and physically among people in—for instance—ourgreat cities? For millions of years, They have worked behind the scenes,utilising the minds, brains and physical equipment of Their disciples in orderto carry out Their beneficent purposes. Such workers under hierarchicalinspiration are by no means mediumistic in their nature, but have established aright relationship with their own souls and with the Master of their Ashram.They are responsive to hierarchical impression; they know the plans which theMasters are endeavouring to carry out, and their cooperation is willingly andconsciously given; they are left entirely free to work as they see fit—after duerecognition of the information and the inspiration given.Will this system of working on behalf of humanity come to an end? In what mannerwill the effective and needed changes be made? How will the proposedorganisation take place? Of how much of these changes and organisation willaverage humanity be aware? These and many similar questions almost automaticallyarise in your minds, and it is essentially necessary that the creativeimagination [653] of the advanced man, of aspirants, of probationary disciples(as well as that of the working disciple), does not run riot, creating thosethoughtforms which could intervene between the true vision and the work to bedone, and interfere therefore with the needed manifestation. It is exceedinglyimportant that the following facts should be realised: the thinking of those whoare preparing humanity for the reappearance of the Christ must be most closelyguarded and controlled; wishful thinking and the formulation of plans in linewith ordinary human methods and techniques must not be permitted at this time.The first lesson, therefore, which you have to learn in this work ofpreparation, is controlled thought and sensitivity to hierarchical impression.The sole task which confronts you and all aspirants and disciples, is to preparehumanity for two events:1. The organisation of certain of the Masters’ Ashrams in the differentcountries of the world wherein they can render effective service.2. The reappearance of the Christ at a date somewhat later than theexternalisation of the Ashrams and their physical plane organisation.How, where, when and in what manner the Masters will make Their appearance isnone of your affair. Their plans are laid, and They look for and expect nounthinking and unintelligent obstructions and assumptions from those to whom thetask of preparation is committed. They have seen to it that the teaching of theNew Age has been given to aspirants and disciples in the world, fordistribution; They are rapidly admitting new disciples into Their Ashrams, andas fast as is desirable and permissible (for the Hierarchy works ever under law)They are passing them into the halls of initiation.At the same time, competent disciples are searching the world for sensitive andwilling aspirants; these disciples are laying their emphasis upon intelligenceand spiritual freedom, working out as free and understanding cooperation; [654]these disciples will not be sidetracked by the devotion—unintelligentlyexpressed—of the neophyte upon the occult way. It is occult students for whomsearch is now being made, and not mystics; it is for clear-thinking men andwomen that the call has gone forth, and not for the fanatic or for the personwho sees nothing but the ideal, and who is unable to work successfully withsituations and things as they are, and who cannot, therefore, apply thenecessary and unavoidable compromise.The coming or the advent of the Hierarchy on earth will not bring the sudden andthe beneficent changes which the enthusiastic desire. Every necessaryevolutionary move is always a slow move. At no time will the Hierarchy infringethe natural processes of evolutionary growth or the normally slow development ofthe various kingdoms in nature towards divine expression. The Masters will,however, take advantage of all the points attained by these kingdoms, and Theywill (at certain critical times) utilise the more advanced specimens of thenatural types—in a selective process—in order to bring in something new, betteror different. This applies to the human kingdom just as much as it does to thevegetable, for instance. There is a line of thought for you in this statement.One major technique employed by the Hierarchy is a constantly appliedstimulation. Of this, the effect of the sun upon all life-forms is a symbol. Itmust however be remembered that the Masters have, therefore, to apply suchstimulation scientifically, working first in one direction and then in another,modifying the stimulation and the inpouring stream of energy to meet a need;this They do in order to produce the desired result, and to bring to fruitionthat which is latent within the individual. They work with seven major types ofenergy; five of these are now in full use and two of them are rapidly cominginto effective service. It must be borne in mind that I am here referring to theuse of stimulating, vivifying, fructifying and mutable energies under what iscalled (esoterically) “scientific impression.” These energies are: [655]1. The energy of prana; this is the life-giving energy from the Sun which dealsout both life and death, health and disease, according to the quality of thesubstance or material form upon which it makes its impact. This impact and itsresults are today entirely automatic in application and effectiveness, and areregarded as functioning “below the threshold of the consciousness” of humanity,and necessarily of the Hierarchy. Its rhythm is established and its effects arewell known and proven. The direction of this energy will eventually be in thehands of that great planetary centre, Humanity; therefore, to mankind will thenbe committed the responsibility for its distribution to the sub-human kingdomsin nature.2. The energy of the emotions or that of the astral plane. This energy is todayin a condition of extra-ordinary activity, producing basic changes upon allsides, stimulating desire (both good and bad), and governing, via the solarplexus centre, all that lies below the diaphragm in the human vehicle ofexpression upon etheric and physical levels. This, when combined with a powerfulinflow of the energy of prana, produces and stimulates every aspect of theanimal magnetism with which every physical form is equipped; when combined withthe energy of mind, it produces a magnetic personality, and this in both thegood and the bad sense.3. The energy of the mental plane. This is rapidly coming into an unique potencyand its effects today are reaching down into the very depths of humanity, thusbringing to the surface the mental capacity which is latent in and hithertounused by the masses of men everywhere. It can be described as pouring into thehuman consciousness by means of four divisions of mental energy:a. The energy of ideological thought.b. The energy of religious formulations; these are [656] in process of creatinggreat changes in the minds of men concerning the religious concepts of the worldand the new spiritual values.c. The energy which is today producing the struggle for freedom and liberationfrom environing conditions. This may express itself as the world fight (at thistime) for the freedom of the will of men, as it expresses itself in the press,in speech, in government, or in the struggle for a deepened spiritual life forman. This “energy of liberation” was sensed, registered and voiced for humanityby Franklin D. Roosevelt in The Four Freedoms, so much discussed by men today;he thereby laid the foundation for the new civilisation and the new worldculture.d. The energy of the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, as it is applied todayby the Hierarchy in the transmutation of the sad and sorry past of humanity intothe glorious prospect of the New Era. This is, as you may well imagine, asevenfold energy, emanating from and directed by the seven major Ashrams, underthe direction of the Christ and of the senior Masters and Chohans, deciding incouncil the method, the extent and the quality of the distribution of the energyinvolved; They decide also where it should make its impact so as to achieve thebest and the most constructive results. It is with this sevenfold energy thatthe Hierarchy will work in preparation for its physical plane manifestation andfor the reappearance of the Christ.4. The energy of humanity itself, organised and directed by the advancedthinkers and workers in all and every (and this I reiterate) branch of humanexecutive work; in every educational process and in all political regimes. Iwould most definitely emphasise the widespread nature of this energy contactbecause esoteric students have very frequently [657] the erroneous idea that theHierarchy works only through the medium of esoteric and so-called occult groups.The more advanced a man may be, the more sensitive to impress he becomes, andthe human race has now reached a point of sensitivity never before attained.This has happened through the agency of the energies listed above. Disciples andaspirants and the intelligentsia everywhere and in every land aretoday—consciously or unconsciously—responsive to these four energies; the closerthey are affiliated with some Ashram in the Hierarchy, the more the sevenfoldhierarchical energies can be distributed to the rest of the human family. It istherefore in this field that the major hierarchical endeavour will—during thenext fifty years—express itself. Here, consequently, lies the fundamentalproblem confronting the Hierarchy, for these energies must be most carefullydirected and their resultant impact be most scientifically considered ifover-stimulation is to be avoided.5. The energy of the second aspect of divinity, vaguely called by the mystics ofthe past era “the Christ consciousness.” This naturally focusses through theChrist Himself, standing as the Representative in the Hierarchy of the solarenergy of love-wisdom. It is a form of peculiar, magnetic energy of whichmankind today knows little; nevertheless, upon this energy much speculation hasbeen permitted and many false thoughtforms have been built. It is a dangerousenergy because of its exceeding potency and also because this inflowing energyhas to use the vehicle of the substance of the three lower worlds, and its areaof influence is on the three lower planes of human existence. This at firstnecessarily produces conflict, and its first major conflict is now impending. Ihave dealt with this conflict elsewhere when discussing with you the fourth Rayof Harmony through Conflict. (A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Volume V.) The useof this second fundamental energy (which is the primary energy of our presentsolar system, focussing [658] upon our planetary life) presents to ChristHimself a great test of His skill in action; its use constitutes the major testor task which faces Him when He reappears and has the responsibility ofreleasing its potencies on earth. The task of all disciples is consequently topromote wisdom, and this they must learn to do under the influence of theBuddha. He taught the primary lesson of mental discrimination and detachment—twobasic qualities which must be called into activity during this amazingpreparatory period with which all aspirants are today confronted.These are, therefore, the points which all groups of disciples and spiritualworkers must learn to present to seeking humanity. They concern the creating andthe vitalising of the new world religion. This theme lies at the root of allthat is new: discrimination between the mental approach and the soul approach,thus learning that true detachment which was symbolically but erroneouslyapplied by all monastic orders throughout the world (both occidental andoriental) during the past few centuries, applied therefore in time and space buthaving no relation to the inner spiritual import. The true monastic spirit anddiscipline will emerge later in the historical processes of humanity.6. The energy of the first divine aspect (that of will or power) now beingapplied with the most scrupulous care by Shamballa. This energy of the willis—as you have been taught—the potency of the life in all beings; it has in thepast only been permitted to make contact with “the substance of humanity” viathe Hierarchy. Lately, direct impact has been permitted experimentally and ofthis the world war (1914-1945) was the first evidence, clarifying issues,presenting opportunity, purifying human thinking and destroying the old andworn-out civilisation. It is an exceedingly dangerous energy and cannot beapplied in fuller measure until the race of men has learned to respond moreadequately to the energy of the second aspect of love-wisdom, and therefore tothe rule of the Kingdom of God. [659]7. There remains another energy which can only be applied very much later on andonly if the activity of the six preceding energies fulfil their purpose. With itwe cannot here deal, for the future is too uncertain, and in any case, it willonly come into activity in the middle of the Aquarian Age.These energies, along with the five specialised energies referred to in my June(1948) Full Moon Message will swing into great activity as the years slip away.The year 1952 will see the five specialised energies assuming great potency.I would again call your attention to the fact that the evocative power of theGreat Invocation (now used by so many hundreds of thousands) and the sound ofits mantric rhythm is increasingly responsible for this work; a great deal ofthe resultant effectiveness is due to the fact that humanity is using thismantram in steadily increasing numbers, and this—combined with its scientificuse by the Hierarchy—is very fruitful in results. It is well here to bear inmind that (to quote an old sentence by one of the Masters) “where the focus is,so will be the anchorage where descending potencies under mantric inspirationare concerned.” This means that, due to the effort of countless thousands of menand women everywhere, energies hitherto unable to penetrate deeper intosubstance than the hierarchical substance and the levels of the higher mentalplane can now, for the first time, be successfully anchored on dense physicallevels or at least upon etheric levels. This is a fact and is far more importantthan you are perhaps able to appreciate.I have earlier told you that the five Masters concerned with the initial stagesof the organisation of the Hierarchy on earth are the Master K.H., the MasterMorya, the Master R., the Master Who started the labour movement in the modernworld, and myself, the so-called Master D.K.The division of labour is here of great interest. In my June message for 1948, Ireferred to the five specialised energies which were at that time released tocarry forward their [660] impersonal task. Each of these energies is concernedwith the desired organisation, for it must ever be remembered that though theorganisation which we are considering is concerned with the interior orsubjective work of the Hierarchy, the repercussions and the resultant effectswill take place on earth, with physical plane effects, because the old occulttruism “as above, so below” will be rapidly and objectively demonstrated. Thisresult and the effects produced will constitute one of the modes whereby theHierarchy will prove its factual presence on earth.The Ashram of the Master K.H. is already assuming an increased stimulatingpotency, but it will nevertheless be one of the last to manifest objectively onthe physical plane. The mission of that Ashram is to produce the energy whichwill make possible and definite the Reappearance of the Christ. Thatreappearance is the major preoccupation of the Master K.H. and His group ofinitiates and disciples. The first step taken by the Ashram was embodied—as faras all of you are concerned—in the pamphlet entitled The Reappearance of theChrist (Wesak Message, May 1947). To this must be added the vitalisation and thestimulation of the two-thousand-year-old thoughtform which men, down thecenturies, have created in anticipation of His coming or advent. The movementtoward expectancy and preparation is now rapidly gaining momentum. This was thefirst concrete result of the combined desire of this second ray Ashram. However,the work being done in this Ashram is more definitely concerned with three linesof activity. These are:1. The preparation of the many combined Ashrams, leading to externalisation.2. The formulation of the techniques and disciplines which will be of service tothe initiate or disciple who is making the primary effort to functionobjectively, to work before the screen of life and not behind the scenes, ashitherto, and to develop that [661] “resistant capacity” which is needed towithstand the violent impacts of physical plane living.3. The mental and spiritual registration of the plans of the Christ, and theconsequent development of that skill in action which will permit these plans tomaterialise correctly.Within the second ray Ashram of the Master K.H. and His affiliated groups (suchas the Ashram for which I am responsible) it is the energy of wisdom which isbeing effectively used. It might be said that this dual energy, hitherto a fusedand blended energy, is today working as a true duality. The energy of wisdom isactive within all the Ashrams (on all rays and under all the Masters); theenergy of love is directed primarily towards the third great planetary centre,Humanity, stimulating the aura of that mass of living units so that their“magnetic appeal will be the outstanding quality of their divine approach.” Thedirecting Agents for this dual activity are the Master K.H. and a chosen groupof His senior initiates and disciples, of whom I am not one, because I haveanother task committed to me.The Master K.H. is therefore constantly in close association with the Christ,the Head of the Hierarchy. Christ is today, with the aid of the Lord of theWorld and the Buddha, preparing Himself for the most difficult task with whichHe has ever been confronted. It is not a matter of the Christ issuing forth fromthe High Place where He is today to be found, and suddenly appearing among men;it is not a case of His taking infant form and growing into His work withadvancing years; it is not a case of His being instantly recognised andacclaimed by millions of miserable human beings awaiting liberation. None ofthese ideas or hopes form any part of His plan, nor are they possible. No Memberof the Hierarchy, and certainly not its Supreme Head, attempts to bring aboutresults which are doomed to failure; presented thus, they would be bound tofail, because the point of sensitivity of humanity makes [662] failureinevitable—if success is expected along these most ordinary lines.Skill in action, wise and understanding judgment, the adaptation of presentaffairs to the desired future, the coordination of the work to be done, and theclear enunciation of the platform upon which the new teaching must be founded,plus the survey (if I may so express it) of the foundations upon which the newstructure of the coming civilisation must be founded—it is with these thingsthat the Christ is at this time concerned. You can realise, therefore, thetremendous and cooperative activity with which the Master K.H. and His Ashramare concerned. The stimulation of that activity comes from two directions:necessarily from Shamballa, from the Buddha and from the Avatar of Synthesis,and increasingly from the world of men, as expectancy, hope and demand combineto make their united appeal.The Ashram or group centre through which the Master Morya works is alsoexceedingly busy. It is obvious to you that as this is a first ray Ashram, theenergy coming from the Avatar of Synthesis will make its primary impact uponthis Ashram, which provides the line of least resistance. There, it isscientifically stepped down or broken down, prior to distribution to the Ashramsof the five Masters engaged in the work of preparation.The highest aspect possible of assimilation by the Hierarchy is directed by theMasters towards the Christ and is used by Him in His individual and plannedpreparatory work. Though He demonstrated when here before that His mission orwork had a group or brotherhood objective, it is well known in hierarchicalcircles that first ray synthesis is something higher still than unity, and thateven the Christ has somewhat to grasp anent this new potency—coming both fromShamballa or from the Father (as the Christ used to call that emanating source),and also from extra-planetary sources. Above all, He has the difficult task oftraining or adapting His physical vehicle so that it can assimilate thisextra-ordinary high potency and, at the same time, keep it [663] in a conditionin which He can move outward on the physical plane among men.The Christian Church has laid so much emphasis on Christ’s unique position asthe one and only Son of God that great error has crept in and has been fosteredfor centuries; Christ Himself foresaw the possibility of this error and tried tooffset it by pointing out that we are all the “Sons of God” and that “greaterthings than I do shall you do”—a statement which no commentators have everunderstood or adequately explained. The occult fact is that there is no being onEarth, from the very lowest form of life to the very highest, who is not movingonward towards a greater and finer expression of divinity, and Christ Himself isno exception to this universal evolutionary law. He is therefore, at this timeand because He is preparing to raise the entire human family nearer to God,laying Himself open to certain powerful inflowing energies, absorbing intoHimself streams of spiritual force, and undergoing a dynamic stimulation whichis entirely new to Him; this constitutes His testing for the exalted initiationwhich now confronts Him; it constitutes also the sacrifice He is making in orderto complete His work on Earth and bring a new salvation to humanity.The Christ is working, therefore, in very close cooperation with the MasterMorya, and also with the Manu (one of the three Heads of the Hierarchy), andthese three—the Christ, the Manu and the Master Morya—create a triangle ofenergies into which (and through which) the energy of the Avatar of Synthesiscan pour, finding right direction under Their combined efforts.On the physical plane, the initiates and the disciples working in the Ashram ofthe Master Morya are primarily occupied with the expression of synthesis in theworld of politics and of government, and with offsetting wrong approaches tosynthesis, seeking to preserve freedom in unity. It is a subjective synthesisfor which they work—a synthesis which will express itself in an outerdifferentiation. This synthesis will define the many aspects of the essential,basic [664] unity which, working out under the stimulation of the energy ofsynthesis, will bring about eventual peace and understanding on earth—a peacewhich will preserve individual and national cultures, but which will subordinatethem to the good of the whole of humanity.We come now to the preparatory work being done by the Master Who started what iscalled by you “the labour movement.” This is regarded by the Hierarchy as one ofthe most successful attempts in all history to awaken the masses of men (in thebrackets called middle class and lower class) to general betterment, and thusset up a momentum which would, occultly speaking, “swing them into light.”Along with the development of the labour movement, mass education came intobeing, with the result that—from the angle of developed intelligence—the entirelevel of conscious awareness was universally raised. There is still muchilliteracy, but the average citizen in all the western democracies and in theSoviet Union is as well educated as the intellectual man in the Middle Ages. Youhave, in this activity, an outstanding instance of how the Masters work, for (tothe average onlooker) the labour movement arose from within the masses and theworking classes; it was a spontaneous development, based upon the thinking andthe teaching of a mere handful of men who were regarded primarily as agitatorsand trouble makers; they were in reality a group of disciples (many of themunconscious of their esoteric status) who were cooperating with the Law ofEvolution and also with the hierarchical Plan. They were not particularlyadvanced disciples, but they were affiliated with some Ashram (according totheir ray), and were therefore subject to impression. Had they been advanceddisciples or initiates, their work would have been futile, for theirpresentation of the Plan would not have been adapted to the level of theintelligence of the then totally uneducated masses composing labour.This Master works primarily with the intelligentsia, and He is therefore a thirdray Master—upon the Ray of Active Intelligence. His Ashram is occupied with theproblems [665] of industry, and the goal of all the thinking, all the planningand all the work of impressing receptive minds is directed towardsspiritualising the concepts of the labour party in every country, and ofindustrialists, thus turning them towards the goal of right sharing, as a majorstep towards right human relations. This Master therefore cooperates with theMaster R.—Who is the Head of the third ray Ashram, and Who is also one of theTriangle of Forces which controls the greater Ashram of the Hierarchy Itself.The Ashram of this Master (Who has always withheld His name from publicknowledge) is a lesser Ashram within the major third ray Ashram, just as myAshram lies within the ring-pass-not of the Ashram of the Master K.H. ThisMaster is necessarily an Englishman, for the industrial revolution startednearly one hundred years ago in England, and the potency of the work done isrelated to its mass effect and to the results achieved in every land by labourand its methods. All the great labour organisations, national and international,are loosely knit together subjectively, because in each group this Master hasHis disciples who are working constantly to hold the movement in line with thedivine Plan. It is well to bear in mind that all great movements on earthdemonstrate both good and evil; the evil has to be subdued and dissipated, orrelegated to its right proportional place, before that which is good and in linewith hierarchical planning can find true expression. What is true of theindividual is true also of groups. Before the soul can express itself throughthe medium of the personality, that personality has to be subdued, controlled,purified and dedicated to service. It is this controlling, subduing processwhich is going on now, and it is vociferously fought by the selfish andambitious elements.Nevertheless, the work of this Master is outstandingly successful in preparingthe intellectual principle of the masses for eventual right recognition of theChrist. A right sense of values is being developed, and in the right directionof this potent labour group in every land lies the foundation of the newcivilisation.[666] The Ashram of this Master is therefore occupied with worldwide economicproblems, and also with a direct attack upon the basic materialism to be foundin the modern world. The problems of barter and exchange, the significance ofmoney, the value of gold (a basic symbol of the third Ray of ActiveIntelligence), the production of right attitudes towards material living, andthe entire process of right distribution are among the many problems dealt within this Ashram; the work done is enormous and of great importance in preparingmen’s mind for the return of the Christ and for the New Age which He willinaugurate. Capitalists and labour leaders, financial experts and thinkingworkers, and members of all the differing ideologies which are prevalent in theworld today are to be found actively working within this Ashram. Many of themare what the orthodox religious man or the hide-bound occult student wouldregard as non-spiritual, yet all of them are in reality deeply spiritual in thecorrect sense, but they care not for labels, for schools of thought nor foracademic, esoteric teaching. They exemplify within themselves a livingness whichis the hallmark of discipleship.The time has come when the first and major principle governing true esotericismmust be grasped as conditioning all hierarchical workers: Right Motive.The time has come when the quality of ashramic work is recognised, first of all,as being: Selfless Service.The time has come when men everywhere must realise that entry into a Master’sAshram is dependent upon Intelligence , plus right motive and service.When these three factors are present in any human being, the Masters know thatgood material is presented to Them for training. Today the world is full of suchmen and women, and in them lies the dominant hope of the future.One more point I would like to discuss. Through the work of this Master and HisAshram the “sealing of the door where evil dwells” will come about, because itis essentially this group which (if I dare so express it) is coping [667] withraw materialism and the false values which it engenders. The door has to besealed by a vast mass of coordinated human forces, and not by one or twoenlightened men. This fact must be grasped by you. The energy of love-wisdom,the energy of the second ray, can and will bring in the Kingdom of God; theenergy of the divine will can and will galvanise with its dynamic potency theentire human family to the point where a group transition will take place fromthe fourth into the fifth kingdom. It is nevertheless this third ray energy, aswielded in the Ashram of this English Master, under the direction of theMahachohan, the Lord of Civilisation, which will force a right attitude towardmaterialism, which will bring about a balance between the material values andthe spiritual, and which will eventually thrust back into futility the Forces ofEvil which have for so long distracted the world of men. I am choosing my wordswith care.You will note, therefore, how the three divine aspects are united in one greatmovement to bring in the Kingdom of God, and that the first step towards thislonged-for consummation is the appearance of the Masters upon the physicalplane, and then, somewhat later, the reappearance of the Christ.We now come to a consideration of the vast Ashram controlled by the Master R. Heis the Lord of Civilisation and His is the task of bringing in the newcivilisation for which all men wait. It is a third ray Ashram, and thereforeenfolds within its ring-pass-not all the Ashrams to be found upon the third Rayof Active Intelligence, upon the fifth Ray of Concrete Science and upon theseventh Ray of Ceremonial Order. All these Ashrams are working under the generaldirection of the Master R. He works primarily through the Masters of these threetypes of ray energy. He Himself at this time is occupied with seventh rayenergy, which is the order-producing energy upon our planet.This is the Ray of Ceremonial Order, and through the activity of its energy,when correctly directed and used, a right rhythm is being imposed upon allaspects of human [668] living. An effort is being constantly made to arrest theugly chaos of the present and to produce the ordered beauty of the future. Themajor weapon now being used by the combined Forces of Evil is chaos, disruption,lack of established security, and consequent fear. The potency of these evilforces is exceedingly great because they belong to no one group of people and toall the ideologies. The chaos produced by indifference, the chaos produced byuncertainty, the chaos produced by fear, by starvation, by insecurity, bywatching others suffer innocently, and the chaos produced by the warring andconflicting ambitious elements in every nation (without exception )—these arethe factors with which the Master R. is attempting to deal; the task is one ofsupreme difficulty. The entire rhythm of international thinking has to bealtered, and that constitutes a slow and arduous task; the evil personalitieswhich, in every country, are responsible for the chaos and uncertainty, haveeventually to be replaced by those who can work in cooperation with the rhythmof the seventh ray, and thus produce ordered beauty.The task is further complicated by the fact that in the substitution of orderfor chaos, national cultures must be preserved and the outline of the newcivilisation presented to the people. This major Ashram is therefore confrontedwith two elements in every land and nation: those people who hold on to the badold things of the past, and those who work for the extreme opposite of thispoint of view and for that which is new. Under the influence of this seventh rayenergy balance has to be brought about and preserved, so that the “noble middleway” of right action and of right human relations can be safely trodden. Thetask of the Master R. is, however, lightened by the fact that the seventh ray isnow coming into activity and its potency is increasing year by year. His task isalso aided by the intelligent work done by the Ashram of the English Master Whoworks consistently with the awakening and the arising masses.Every October and every March, the Master R. gathers [669] together His councilof helpers, the Masters and the senior initiates in the Ashrams of the third,the fifth and the seventh rays. Though He is the Head of the third Ray of Aspectand is in control, therefore, of the two Rays of Attribute mentioned above, Hedoes not Himself wield these forces, because He is One of the three Heads of theHierarchy and His work cannot be confined to the activity of any one ray. Heworks through the Ashrams of these rays, but He Himself works primarily incooperation with the Christ and the Manu.Now we come to the work which I (D.K.), a second ray Master, am attempting todo. With what energies am I working? What is the goal towards which I amstriving under the direction of the three great Lords of the Hierarchy? I amworking with the energy of right human relations; this is a definite andintegral part of the energy of the second ray. It is a magnetic type of energyand draws men together for betterment and for right understanding. It is alsorelated in a peculiar way to the energy of the first Ray of Will or Power.Perhaps this will be clearer to you if I point out that the will-to-good is anaspect of the Ray of Will, but that goodwill is an attribute of the second Rayof Love-Wisdom, thus relating that ray to the first ray.There is no need for me to enlarge upon the work which I am doing in and throughmy Ashram; you know it well, for I have frequently outlined it, and my bookspresent the goal adequately for this generation.In this particular though relatively short cycle, my Ashram is in a keyposition. It is closely linked to the first ray Ashram of the Master Morya,through the work of Men of Goodwill and through all goodwill movements in theworld at this time. Goodwill is essentially an expression of the second Ray ofLove-Wisdom, and is therefore an aspect of all the Ashrams in that great secondray Ashram, the Hierarchy. But all goodwill work is today being galvanised alsointo violent activity through the dynamic energy of the first ray, expressingthe will-to-good.You have, therefore, this dynamic type of energy channelled [670] through theAshram for which I am responsible. This Ashram works also in close cooperationwith that of the Master R. because the intelligent activity of the energy ofgoodwill is our objective, and its expression through intelligence, applied withwisdom and with skill in action, is the task demanded of all men and women ofgoodwill throughout the world. When the Labour Movement is swept by the energyof goodwill, basic changes in world affairs will take place. I would ask allworkers for goodwill to attempt to reach labour in all countries with theseideas, correctly presented.I have tried here to give you some idea of the synthesis of this hierarchicalwork for humanity, and thereby give to all men and women of goodwill the neededcourage to go forward.You ask me (and rightly) of what use is all this information to men and to theaspirant who is trying to serve? The one thing which humanity needs today is therealisation that there IS a Plan which is definitely working out through allworld happenings, and that all that has occurred in man’s historical past, andall that has happened lately, is assuredly in line with that Plan. Necessarilyalso, if such a Plan exists, it pre-supposes Those Who are responsible for theoriginating of the Plan and for its successful carrying forward. From thestandpoint of average humanity, who think in terms of earthly happiness, thePlan should be something joyful and something which would make material lifeeasier. To the spiritual Hierarchy, the Plan involves those arrangements orcircumstances which will raise and expand the consciousness of mankind andenable men, therefore, to discover the spiritual values for themselves and tomake the needed changes of their own free will, and thus produce the demandedbetterment of the environment, consistent with the unfolding spiritualrecognition.Nothing of true value is to be gained by any arbitrary or autocratic activity onthe part of the spiritual Hierarchy. That is one of the lessons to be learnt, asthe work of the totalitarian powers—in the past and today—and its effects [671]are noted. Under the totalitarian system, freedom is curtailed or abolished, thefree will of the individual is denied and prevented expression, the individualis regarded as the appurtenance of the all-powerful State and held in thatposition by police regimentation; individual development is of value only in sofar as the interests of the State are served, but the individual himself—as anindependent divine unit of humanity—is non-existent, from the totalitarian pointof view. Would you, therefore, have the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet workalong totalitarian lines, enforcing peace and comfort, taking steps to arrestevil by force and working for the material well-being of men? Or would you havethe Masters lead humanity itself, through right understanding, to take theneeded action, even if it involves trial and error and a much slower process?Would you have mankind standing on its own feet as intelligent agents of thedivine Plan? Or would you have them treated as irresponsible children who mustbe energetically protected against themselves? Is it not better for the rapidlyawakening intelligence and activity of men (in every land) to be trained torecognise the essential unity of all human beings, and so be led to take theaction needed which will endorse that unity, which will work for the entiregroup of human beings in all lands everywhere, and which will also and at thesame time preserve the individual and the national cultures, alongside auniversal civilisation and a world-wide system of divine recognition? It istoward this general freedom and the intelligent activity of the free individualthat the Hierarchy is steadily and successfully working; the concept of unityand of united activity for the good of all is far more widely grasped andunderstood than you perhaps realise. The totalitarian approach works toward animposed unity and one which will include all peoples and bind them down to auniformity of belief—politically, economically and socially—and which will anddoes basically ignore the spiritual values, putting the State in the place ofthat divine spiritual centre where spiritual reality is to be found.The method of the Hierarchy is to work through individuals [672] and throughgroups for the production of such a widespread spiritual recognition that meneverywhere will accept as factual the inner government of the planet, and willwork together for the founding of the Kingdom of God in objective manifestationon Earth—and not in some distant time and some vague heaven. This is no mysticalor impossible dream, but is simply the recognition and the externalisation ofthat which has been for ever present, which definitely took objective form whenChrist was with us two thousand years ago, and which will proceed to universalrecognition when He is with us again in the immediate future.Therefore, all who work and struggle for the good of humanity and under thedirection of the Hierarchy, take heart and renew your courage. The Hierarchy notonly stands (as oft I have told you), but It is approaching daily and yearlycloser to humanity. The power of the focussed, spiritual unity of the Hierarchycan be felt today in many ways; it is largely responsible for the patient effortof all humanitarian workers and of all who vision unity in the face of greatodds, and in spite of the fatigued lethargy and the pessimism which conditions,too hard for human endurance, have imposed upon men’s minds. The Hierarchystands and works. The Masters are working according to Plan—a Plan which isfounded in the past history of the race and can there be traced; a Plan whichnecessitated because of human selfishness, the drastic horror of the war(1914-1945); a Plan which today can and will bridge the gulf which now existsbetween the unsatisfactory, selfish and material past and that new future whichwill demonstrate a large measure of world unity, and which will steadily andwith skill in action substitute the spiritual values for those which havehitherto held sway.The guarantee of this is the developing intelligence of men everywhere fightingblindly for freedom and for understanding, and receiving ever the innerassurance, knowledge [673] and aid of Those Who are working out (as always)those situations and conditions wherein mankind can best arrive at divineexpression.THE EFFECTS OF THE EXTERNALISATIONSeptember 1949In my previous instruction upon this theme I dealt with the various energieswhich would be brought into activity or utilised when the Masters emerged fromthe silence in which They have guarded Themselves for so many thousands ofyears. The point to be grasped is that the energies with which I dealt will beused in a new and more vital manner. These energies are ever present and everactive, but they swing into activity sequentially and under law and order, andsome are more prominent at one time than others; they act vitally andenergetically in the needed programme which the plans of the Hierarchy mayentail in any particular cycle.These energies bring about what we idly call the “events” of the day; theycondition our passing civilisations and are so much a part of the world in whichwe live and move and have our being that events, as expressions of directedenergies, mean little to us, except in so far as they may affect adversely ourpersonalities. They connote simply a way of life in any specific time. Theseenergies were started on their activities in the very night of time; theyestablished—each of them—their needed cyclic rhythm; they are responsible forthe activity of substance on matter or of the action of the vital or ethericbody upon matter; they are the lowest formulated expression of the creativeIntelligence, embodying the principle of life or livingness because theyessentially are life itself and life in action. Forget not that dense matter isnot a principle; it is only that which is responsive to the creative principle.When, however, the externalisation of the Hierarchy begins to take place (and itwill be spread over quite a long [674] period of time), the impact of thesesubstantial energies on matter will be radically altered because they willbe—for the first time in history—directed from etheric levels, from the ethericbody of the planet in the three worlds; hitherto, these energies have beendirected from the buddhic plane which is the lowest of the cosmic ethericlevels. Fundamentally, direction will still be from the buddhic plane, but thedetailed and focussed direction will be given from within the three worlds andupon the physical plane; this will be the task of the externalised Ashrams,organised to function openly.It was the knowledge that this important development was imminent which made theHierarchy in the last century widen the area or the scope of its teachingactivity and thus bring to the consciousness of modern man the knowledge of whatoccultism essentially means. The keynotes upon which the occult philosophy isbuilt are:1. There is naught in manifestation except organised energy2. Energy follows or conforms itself to thought3. The occultist works in energy and with energies.The thought of God brought the universe of energies into organised form upon thehighest of the seven planes, or upon the first cosmic etheric level. Theseenergies have for untold aeons been directed from the fourth or lowest of thecosmic etheric planes, the plane which we call the buddhic and regard as thefirst definitely spiritual plane, in our usually erroneous thought; thisdirection has been under impression from Shamballa, and the Masters have“manipulated these energies in conformity with the Plan, which is the blueprintof the Purpose.”In the great Approach of the Hierarchy to humanity and its imminent appearanceupon the physical plane, the centre of direction will also necessarily approachstill nearer, and—as a result of the future hierarchical manifestation—centresof energy direction will be found wherever the Ashram of a Master is located inany part of the world. This is a statement [675] of profound significance; it isan indication of hierarchical policy and a mode whereby modern science (workingas it does with energies) can be brought into cooperative association andrelation with an Ashram upon the physical plane, knowing it for what it is—anentirely new departure.Earlier I stated that the physical plane areas or localities which constitutethe present modern exits for energies, through which directed energies can passto carry out the creative process, are five in number: New York, London, Geneva,Darjeeling and Tokyo. These five form a five-pointed star of interlockingenergies, symbolic of the major divisions of our modern civilisation. I wouldhave you bear in mind that all that I am here giving you anent energy is inrelation to the human kingdom and to nothing else; I am not relating theseenergies to the other kingdoms in nature; I am here concerned with physicalplane utilisation of energy through the power of directed thinking and on behalfof the evolution and well-being of mankind. At each one of these five centresone of the Masters will be found present, with His Ashram, and a vortex ofspiritual forces will there be organised to hasten and materialise the plans ofthe Christ for the new and coming world cycle.The organising of these five centres will be done slowly and gradually. A seniordisciple will appear and will work quietly at the foundation work, gatheringaround him the needed agents, aspirants and assistants. All these workers at anyparticular centre will be trained to think, and the effort now present in theeducational and social world to force men to think for themselves is a generalpart of this training process. Until a man can do his own thinking and deciding,he cannot be an intelligent, willing and understanding cooperator, working withan ashram and controlling and directing the creative process. If the new heavensand the new earth are to be a fact in manifestation and in reality, it means agreat re-creating process must get under way, and this is the concept lyingbehind the teaching anent the five centres on Earth and the part which they willplay in rebuilding and reorganising the world.[676] As the next few years bring into focus the hierarchical intention,disciples and aspirants must look for those men and those few women who will beworking as a group along spiritual lines in or near one or other of these fivelocalities.Initial opposition to the founding of these centres of clear thinking men andwomen, working freely and understandingly with one of the Masters or seniorinitiates, is already unhappily present; it is to be found in the narrowness,the biassed information and the lack of freedom of the totalitarian schools ofthought. This was inevitable, for the Black Lodge ever endeavours to parallel,offset and undo the work of the White Lodge, and hitherto quite successfully.But the cycle of success is slowly closing because the energy of goodwill,emanated by the Will-to-Good, is rapidly becoming effective.In London, in New York, in Geneva and Darjeeling and in Tokyo, a Master willeventually be found, organising a major energy centre; at the same time HisAshram will continue to function upon buddhic levels, for the entire personnelhas not been alerted for externalisation. The Ashram will therefore be workingon two levels—and yet that is not a correct statement of fact, as there are nolevels, as well you know, but only states of consciousness. Ask me not how thiscan be; ponder on the relation of this dual and simultaneous appearance byattempting to grasp the nature of the manifested form of the planetary Logos inthe Person of Sanat Kumara. Sanat Kumara is not the personality of the planetaryLogos, for personality as you understand it is not existent in His case. It isnot the soul of the planetary Logos, because that soul is the anima mundi andthe soul of all forms in all kingdoms. Sanat Kumara, the Eternal Youth, can beseen by Those Who have the right, presiding, for instance, over the Council inShamballa, yet at the same time He is present as the life and the informingintelligence upon and within our planet.You have therefore five points where the externalisation of the Ashrams willtake place and eventually be focussed. From these points, as time elapses, otherAshrams, subsidiary [677] in nature, will be found emerging, sponsored andfounded by disciples and initiates from these five Ashrams, and representing thethree major rays and two minor rays. To start with, they will be founded throughthe presence in these localities of some senior or world disciple; it must beremembered that the forerunner of all movements which appear upon the physicalplane is an educational propaganda, therefore some disciple upon the second raywill come into action, first of all, in all these five points; he will befollowed by a disciple upon the seventh ray. All world movements are, as wellyou know, externalisations of subjective ideas and concepts and of phases offormulated thinking; and the appearance of the Hierarchy upon earth in tangibleform is no exception to this rule.Disciples in these Ashrams have been in training for nearly one hundred andfifty years to do this work; some have managed to keep the originating idea andimpulse clear and untainted by their own thinking, and have adhered—even intheir own intimate thoughts—to the hierarchical programme, as presented to themby their Masters or the senior initiates. Others have not possessed so clear areasoning faculty or so active an intuitive perception and—whilst graspingcertain major concepts such as world unity or hierarchical gradations andcontrol—have distorted the truth and produced the many ideologies which havewracked the world during the past century; even this distortion is, however,being turned to good, for it produced a redoubled effort on the part of theHierarchy to offset it; it led to an increased forcing process by means of whichmany earnest and willing aspirants reached the grade of accepted disciple; itproduced also a ferment of thought in the world which has served to awaken thementality of the masses to possibilities and to horizons hitherto only visionedby advanced and initiate thinkers. The man in the street today has absorbedideologies to an unforeseen extent, and the attempt to make him an active factorin our modern civilisation is not too harmful in view of the time element, asdivinely conceived, and from the point of view of the staunch and basicintegrity of the divine human being. [678] Time and divinity, events andinstinctual goodness, will in the long run triumph. The intermediate agonies aredistressing but not final, and they are not triumphant from the angle of thedark Forces. These Forces face (as a result of the war and of the resurrectinghuman spirit) a vista of nearing and inevitable defeat.Already the centres in London and in New York are showing signs of life, anddisciples are active in both places and along all lines of human expression. Thecentre in Geneva is also active, but not so thoroughly and inclusively; it waitsfor a greater calm and a firmer sense of security in Europe.The centre in Darjeeling is what is termed occultly “vibrating”, but this is inresponse to the relative nearness and propinquity of the Himalayan Brotherhood;whilst in Tokyo there is small activity as yet, and what there is is of no greatmoment. The work at this centre will actually be brought into being through thework of the Triangles. By that I do not mean that it will be a centre of theTriangle work, but that the concentrated meditative activity of the peopleengaged in the Triangle activities will magnetically draw out that which mustappear when a centre is organised. They are in fact creating the neededatmosphere, and that is ever a preliminary step. Once the atmosphere or the airin which to breathe and move is existent, then the living form can appear.Objectively, therefore, the second ray work of teaching is the first to beorganised. Subjectively, the first ray workers are already active, for the workof the first ray with its disturbing and destroying activity prepares the way;pain and disruption ever precede birth, and the agents of the first ray havebeen working for nearly two hundred years. The agents of the second ray startedtheir preparation around the year 1825 and moved outward in force soon after1860. From that date on, great concepts and new ideas, and the modern ideologiesand arguments for and against aspects of the truth, have characterised modernthought and produced the present [679] mental chaos and the many conflictingschools and ideologies, with their attendant movements and organisations; out ofall these, order and truth and the new civilisation will emerge. Thiscivilisation will emerge as the result of mass thinking; it will no longer be acivilisation “imposed” by an oligarchy of any kind. This will be a newphenomenon and one for which the Hierarchy has had to wait, prior toreappearing. Had the Hierarchy come before this era of thought and of masseddiscussion and the fight to further creative ideas, the tenets and the truthsfor which the Hierarchy stands could be regarded as being also “imposed” uponhumanity, and therefore as infringing human freedom. This will not now be thecase, and the Hierarchy will come forth into exoteric manifestation becausehumanity has, of its own free will, developed a quality analogous to that of theHierarchy and therefore magnetic to that spiritual organisation. Goodwill willdraw forth from its holy secret hiding place the Exponents of Love, and thus thenew world will come into being.These subsidiary ashrams are already being attempted in various parts of theworld. It is necessary for you to remember that the members of these ashramswill not all be on the teaching line, but will be composed of disciples uponmany rays; the attempt to form coherent and integrated ashrams is based upon therecognition of the initial difficulty of the various ray aspirants to comprehendeach other’s point of view and mode of working, and to think in the manydiffering terms and modes of thought. There are, however, three fundamentalrequirements which must condition and colour all the ashrams, no matter what theray:1. An internal group unity, conducive to a synthesis of understanding betweenthe various ashrams. There springs out of a unified group objective a sense ofloyalty to the Hierarchy and a uniformly disciplined life. I said uniform,brother of mine, for the discipline is that of spiritual inclination and aninspired intention which produces a similarity in the livingness [680] of theunits in the ashram; this is, of course, diversified by the ray quality of theaspirants and disciples and by personality tradition. Ponder on those last twowords.2. Similarity of objective. By that I mean an apprehension and appreciation ofthe hierarchical Plan and of the contribution each ashram has to make for itsmaterialisation on earth; to this must be added an united ashramic similarity ofinstinctual and intuitive telepathic rapport with the senior Members of theashram—the Masters and initiates of high degree, and through Them—with theChrist. I would here call to your attention that the mental inclination of allthe esotericists in the world for the past one hundred years has been directedtowards individual rapport with a Master, and this because of the necessity ofdiscovering the ashram with which the aspirant must make contact.This attitude has now widened in its approach mentally, by the many diversifieddisciples in the many different ashrams, into a group movement or a groupinclination towards the Christ, the major and most important factor in theimplementation of the hierarchical Plan. This mental approach is not the samething as the constant aspirational preoccupation of the earnest Christianfollower with the thought of Christ. It is something quite different.It is a unified group endeavour, generated in each ashram and fostered by allalike, to bring the entire group—as a band of world servers—into the aura of thethought currents of the Christ, as He formulates His ideas, creates thethoughtform needed prior to manifestation, and makes His arrangements for Hisreappearing. This is not the same thing as establishing a telepathic rapportbetween an individual disciple and the Christ, for that is not needed ordesirable. The unity of aim, the desire to serve, the recognition of the presentfocussed intention of the Hierarchy (under the guidance of the Christ), becomean invocative, magnetic state of group consciousness; this evokes from theChrist and His informed Masters an identification of Their united thought withthe group aspiration. This is the higher spiritual correspondence of what iscalled in the three worlds kama-manas.[681] This is not, I realise, an easy thing to understand when divorced from theusual Christian concept of the relation of Christ to the individual aspirant.The idea may perhaps be clarified for you by reminding yourselves that some ofyou who read these words know me and have found your way into my Ashram, underthe guidance of your own soul and my ready recognition. Others all over theworld, through their spiritual intuition and their desire to serve and to know,have brought into their recognised area of consciousness the teaching which isgiven in my books. Their relation to me is symbolic of the type of relationwhich disciples and aspirants can and do establish with the Christ. Though theanalogy is far from perfect, it is possible to recognise the correspondence inits many gradations of reciprocal sensitivity.3. A fundamental and basic similarity of sympathetic response by the units inall ashrams to the needs of humanity, to the quality of the programme for theirdevelopment which the objective demands, and to the nature of goodwill andunderstanding (intelligently applied); all these qualities are not handicappedby undue emotional sensitivity.These three conditions will be found in all the ashrams and will unite themembers within any ashram to those in other ashrams in a measure or rhythm oftelepathic relation. From this unified and central position a rapidly deepeningtelepathic relation will inevitably be established and sustained by the group,with the ashram and with the Christ, on the one hand, and with humanity, on theother. With this as a foundational and conditioning quality, the work canproceed as required.You will note, therefore, why I have so consistently emphasised, during the pastthirty years of teaching, the necessity for the development of a truly spiritualand psychic sensitivity, plus the unfoldment of the faculty of a scientifictelepathic rapport. I have thereby laid the foundation of the Science ofImpression, with the illumined and rightly oriented mind as the interpreter, theanalyser and the transmitter. [682]ASHRAMIC ADJUSTMENT TO EXOTERIC LIVINGOctober 1949We now come to another point in our study of this subject: This concerns one ofthe most difficult problems confronting the Masters at this time; it presentsalso an unique problem to the Christ. The daily physical life of the Masters, ofthe Christ, and of those Members of the Hierarchy (initiates and accepteddisciples) Who function in physical bodies, has had its orientation upon thesubjective levels of life; the majority of Them, and particularly the seniorMembers of the Hierarchy, do not as a rule intermingle largely with the publicor walk the streets of our great cities. They work as I do from my retreat inthe Himalayas, and from there I have influenced and helped far more people thanI could possibly have reached had I walked daily in the midst of the noise andchaos of human affairs. I lead a normal and, I believe, useful life as thesenior executive in a large lamasery, but my main work has lainelsewhere—widespread in the world of men; I reach this vast number of humanbeings through the medium of the books which I have written, through the groupswhich I have started and impulsed, such as Men of Goodwill and the Triangles,and through my disciples who talk and spread the truth as I have sought topresent it.So it has been with the work of all the Masters, except two or three Who haveundergone special training in order to do some special preparatory work for theexternalisation of the Hierarchy. The English Master is one of these, andanother Master also Who works, relatively unknown, in North America. I havereferred to Him before as the Master P.—though that is not, in reality, Hisinitial.This rule of solitariness or of withdrawing applies to all the Masters and tothe Christ, for it is in the solitude of the mind, and as far as possible in thesolitude of physical location, that the various branches of the great WhiteLodge have chosen to work ever since Atlantean days. It is not the solitude of aseparative spirit, but the solitude that comes from [683] the ability to benon-separative, and from the faculty of identification with the soul of allbeings and of all forms. This can best be accomplished in the intense quiet ofthose “protected” areas where the Masters in the various branches of theBrotherhood have chosen to dwell. This solitude and physical isolation enablesThem to work almost entirely from the level of the buddhic or intuitional plane,perfecting the Science of Impression, influencing and working through thoseminds which are susceptible to Their mental impression. This applies equally toMasters in physical vehicles and to Those Who have “no anchorage” in the threeworlds; it applies also to disciples who are in or out of the body, according totheir destiny, immediate karma or form of service. St. Paul, for instance, wasin the initiate stage of learning rightly to withdraw and to work in whatPatanjali calls “isolated unity” when he spoke of himself once as “being caughtup into the third heaven” and there learning the untold beauties of the divinelife.The problem, therefore, before the Masters and Their disciples is to work (whenthe externalisation takes place) in the midst of physical plane existence, nolonger withdrawn, isolated and protected, but functioning openly in the middleof events and physical realities and all the diversity of contacts which thethree worlds present. It is perhaps helpful to remember that when the Christ wasin physical presence on earth two thousand years ago, the population of theworld was relatively small compared to that today; contact between peoples waspractically nil, and where it existed was usually of a strictly military orcommercial nature, with a somewhat exclusive interchange of scholastic ideas andpersonnel between the rare centres of learning. It was easy in those days towithdraw into the desert and to disappear into the unfrequented place and torecharge and revitalise the spirit, to touch again closely the Sources ofinspiration on the higher levels of consciousness, and thus reorient the workinginstrument in the three worlds to the higher field of contact and inspiration.Much of this can be noted in the Gospel story of the life of Christ and of theMaster Jesus.[684] When the Christ reappears and the Hierarchy externalises itself on earth,conditions will be totally different; there are today no empty spaces; thepopulation of the world is enormously enlarged and is growing from year to year;no locality is isolated or unattainable; the jungles are open territory to theexplorer and to the numerous commercial agents; vast cities cover the planet andoceans are traversed by multitudes of ships; the airways of the world aretravelled by millions of passengers annually; the land is divided into minutesections by railroads, highways, speedways and myriads of lesser roads andstreets. In fact, every living unit in the world is in touch with thousands ofother units and can—through the many means of information—be in touch withmillions; the news presses grind out the news from hour to hour and the eyes ofmillions are ceaselessly glued to the printed page at all hours of the day ornight; the ears of other millions are daily and hourly attuned to the voice ofthe radio. Only the inner perceptive sense remains inactive, for only advancedhumanity lives constantly in touch with the world of spiritual perception andintention.The conditions, therefore, confronting the Hierarchy constitute a serious anddrastic problem. As far as we can, we will attempt to consider these conditions,for some understanding of the problem is necessary if right work is to be done.Necessarily, the problem is one of a change in the orientation of perception butnot necessarily in modes of living or in any definitely physical planeadjustments. Hierarchical orientation has for some centuries been one of a verystrict internal consolidation, in order that the magnetic aura of the Hierarchymay unfailingly respond to impression from Shamballa, and also be of so potent anature that it can form a protective screen around the human family. Forget notthe nature of the protective service which the Masters have assumed on behalf ofmankind, standing between humanity and the emanations and influences and themagnetic aura of the Black Lodge.This internal consolidation has been greatly strengthened [685] during the pastone hundred years. Because of this, and because of the resultant clarity ofimpression and of the potent out-going influence, the Plan for humanity—as aWhole—was imparted with emphasis to disciples in the Ashrams, and by them wasformulated clearly and presented to humanity.H.P.B. (one of the first working disciples to go forth on the externalisationimpulse and with first ray energy driving him) gave the background of the Plan,under impression from me; the more detailed structure and the sweep of thehierarchical intention have been given by me in the books which A.A.B. hasintroduced under her own name to the public (in so doing acting under myinstructions). For the first time in human history, the purpose of pastevents—historical and psychological—can be clearly noted as the foundation forall present happenings, thus bringing the mysterious Law of Karma in an easymanner to public attention. The present can also be seen, indicating the way ofthe future and revealing clearly the Will-to-Good which is animating the entireevolutionary process—a process in which humanity (again for the first time) isintelligently participating and cooperating. It is this cooperativeparticipation, even if unconsciously rendered, which has made it possible forthe Hierarchy to grasp the opportunity to bring to an end the long silence whichhas persisted since Atlantean days; the Masters can now begin to undertake torenew an ancient “sharing of the secrets,” and to prepare humanity for acivilisation which will be distinguished by a constant intellectual perceptionof truth, and which will cooperate with the externalised Ashrams in the variousparts of the world.The internal consolidation is now being somewhat loosened, if I may use such aninadequate expression, and a majority of the Members of the Hierarchy arewithdrawing Their close attention from reception of impression from Shamballaand are now orienting Themselves—in an entirely new and directed manner—to thefourth kingdom in nature. At the same time, a very powerful minority of Mastersare entering into a much closer association with the Council of Sanat Kumara.[686] In this way the potent and dynamic influence of Shamballa will bestrengthened instead of lessened by the reorientation of the majority of theMasters and initiates. These statements have, of course, implications which willnot be understood by you and which will necessarily pass unnoticed; you willrespond, however, to the realisation that the minority—in renewed and closercontact with Shamballa—have to master the technique of relationship; this willentail much use of the sacrificial will. The reason is that They are (on ahigher turn of the spiral) submitting to a forcing process which will make greatdemands upon Them, but which will serve to release the majority to a new andmore potent form of immediate Earth service. In other words: a few of theMasters and higher initiates are undergoing a special and applied stimulationand are undertaking work for which the united Ashrams, in their higher brackets,have hitherto been responsible. This subjects Them to a great strain and forcesThem to use the will aspect of Their divine natures in entirely new and unknownways. They relinquish much, in order to enable the entire Hierarchy to give farmore in radiance, guidance, and magnetic invocative strength than has evenbefore been the case.The majority of the Masters and initiates, in Their turn, also relinquish muchin order to work exoterically among men. They subject Themselves voluntarily toan active stimulation from the senior “contacting minority” but relinquish the“joy of Shamballic contact”. Temporarily, the training which the majority havebeen receiving in “cosmic orientation,” in the use of the will-to-be (ameaningless phrase to you), and in the “bliss of receptivity to the will-to-goodof Sanat Kumara” is given up. The entire attitude of the group of Masters,initiates and disciples who are to be responsible for the externalisation of theHierarchy and for the preparation for the reappearance of the Christ is focussedupon the expert use of the Science of Contact. This time, the science is usedupon a wide and telepathic scale, with the souls of men, and upon the techniqueof expressing spiritually the nature of “isolated unity” in the cities, junglesand the [687] massed inhabited areas of the earth. This involves, as you canwell imagine, the use of an expert ability to remain untouched by the evilrampant upon the physical plane, and yet to remain in complete sympathetic andunderstanding contact with all humanity and with all events that affecthumanity. It was prophecy which impelled the Christ to say, when last in publicappearance among men, that His disciples were “in the world and yet not of theworld”; Christ depicted in simple yet profoundly revealing terms the life of theMembers of His Ashrams (the entire Hierarchy) when again He would walk with Themin the plain sight of humanity. He pictured Them as one with the Father (theCouncil of Life in Shamballa), and yet as one with Him (as the hierarchicalHead), and as one also with all that breathes and that inhabits form. I adviseall disciples who seek to cooperate with the impending activity of the Hierarchyto study with care the seventeenth chapter of the Gospel of St. John; this waswritten by that disciple of love, under the influence of the energy emanatingfrom the buddhic vehicle of the Christ, which is also—as you have beentold—identical with the buddhic vehicle of the Buddha. The identity of the twovehicles is symbolic of the entire teaching anent “isolated unity” and divineparticipation, which the Masters in Their Ashrams are teaching Their disciplesof all grades, these days, as the first step toward the externalisation of Theiractivities.An intensive training process, therefore, is being carried out in every ashramand along identical lines, resulting in the “isolation,” occultly understood, ofcertain Masters and initiates. They have been thus isolated in order that Theymay work more readily and easily with Shamballa; They can thus form a dynamicand galvanic storehouse of energy (the energy of the divine Will) and thus makeit available for the use of the other Members of the Hierarchy, as They stand in“isolated unity” upon the highways of Earth, and thus are “in the world and yetnot of the world”. The learning of this lesson calls into activity thesacrificial will of both the hierarchical groups; this remains the binding cordbetween Them and that aspect of the antahkarana along which energy can [688]flow in a new and electric fashion from Shamballa, via the hierarchical minorityreferred to above, and into the large group of Masters and initiates anddisciples to whom is committed the task of consolidation. All thisconstitutes—for the Members of the Hierarchy—a definite process of testing outand of trial, prior to and preparatory to some of the higher initiations.Again, the Members of the Hierarchy are not only sensitive to impression fromthe two other planetary centres (Shamballa and Humanity), but They are acutelyaware of the Forces of Evil which are fighting furiously against theexternalisation of the spiritual work. The energy which cosmic evil generates isactive along three main channels:1. From the centre of cosmic evil upon the cosmic astral plane. Of this centreyou can know nothing, and its emanations and its magnetic aura can only beunderstood and recognised or interpreted by the senior Masters and by initiatesof still higher rank. As the potency of the astral plane (which is so familiarto us all) weakens, and glamour and illusion are negated by a rapidspiritualising of humanity, the power of cosmic evil will correspondingly weakenand the Forces of Evil will be unable to reach the planet with their presenteasy effort. It is against the impact of this emanating evil that the Hierarchystands in protection of humanity. Hitherto it has been the task of Shamballa,working through the Hierarchy, to protect humanity from the “intention todestroy” of the cosmic Forces of Evil, but—in the coming cycle and as a resultof the triumph of the Forces of Light in the world war—the potency of Shamballacan be combined with that of the “protecting Agents of Light.”2. From the Black Lodge which is the externalisation of the centre of cosmicevil on Earth. Just as the White Lodge is the representative or correspondenceof the cosmic centre of light upon Sirius (the true Great White Lodge), so theBlack Lodge is also representative of ancient and cosmic evil. The Black Lodgeis also far more advanced in externalisation than is the White Lodge, becausematerialism and matter are, [689] for it, the line of least resistance. TheBlack Lodge is therefore far more firmly anchored upon the physical plane thanis the Hierarchy. It requires a much greater effort for the White Lodge to“clothe itself in matter and work and walk on material levels” than for theBlack Lodge. Owing, however, to the spiritual growth of mankind and to thesteady, even if slow, orientation of mankind to the spiritual Hierarchy, thetime has come when the Hierarchy can materialise and meet the enemy of good uponan even footing; the Hierarchy need not be further handicapped by working insubstance whilst the Forces of Evil work both in substance and in matter. Oncethe reappearance of the Christ and of the Hierarchy is an accomplished fact,these Forces of Evil face sure defeat. The reason for this is that the trend ofhuman living and thought is turning steadily towards the subjective spiritualvalues, even if these values are interpreted in terms of material well-being atpresent and of better living conditions for all—with peace and security also forall. The Black Lodge or the planetary centre of evil works almost entirely uponthe astral plane, and is impressed directly and guided in detail from the cosmicastral plane.3. From the negative or purely material forces of the planet, which are notnecessarily either good or bad but which have been used instinctually and oftunconsciously by humanity for purely material ends, and are therefore basicallyanti-spiritual and subject to the influence of human desire—a desire orientedtowards selfishness, and therefore towards separateness. This form of evil isbeing combated today by the New Group of World Servers. Of this battle you knowsomething because every thinking man and woman is immediately implicated.I have spoken of the evil present in the planet in very simple terms, and thereare phases of it to which I have not referred; the interlocking andinter-penetrating of the grades of evil are far more numerous and intricate thanyou surmise.In summing up, I would say that the present reorientation of the Hierarchy, inrelation both to Shamballa and to [690] Humanity, ushers in the cycle ofcomplete defeat of cosmic evil upon our planet, leaving only an isolated andweakened Black Lodge to die a slow death; this permits the purification of humandesire to such an extent that “matter will be redeemed by the sacrificial willof Those Who know, by the will-to-good of Those Who are, and by the goodwill ofthose sons of men who have turned their faces to the light and who in turnreflect that light.”As all disciples know, one of the problems with which they are constantlyconfronted is an extreme sensitivity to the thought currents of those with whomthey are immediately in contact. The more advanced the disciple, the greater ishis problem. The theory that if one lives and works on a high level ofconsciousness one is immune to that which emanates from the lower level does notin practice hold good. The occult law proclaims that the greater can alwaysinclude the lesser, and just as that is true of the planetary Logos (Who is thesum total of all lesser forms within His manifested universe), so the same lawapplies also to all human beings. The disciple, therefore, can always includethat which emanates from those who are below him on the ladder of evolution. Themore a disciple is under the influence of the Law of Love, the more easily doeshe tune in and absorb the thoughts and register the desires of those around him,and particularly of those who are tied to him in the bonds of affection and ofkarmic relation. As disciples proceed from initiation to initiation, the willaspect fortifies the intellect and directs the expression of the energy of love,and thus the problem lessens, for the initiate learns certain protective ruleswhich are not available to the neophyte. The latter must learn, first of all,how to identify himself with others, as the basis of a higher identificationwhich conditions the senior initiates in the scale of being.The preparation of the Members of the Ashrams found within the Hierarchy, Whomust emerge from Their retreats and live among men in the ordinary intercourseof daily life, has necessitated much discussion and instituted a drastictraining system within the Ashrams. Into the nature of this training [691] Icannot enter, for it differs for disciples upon the various rays and the themeis too large at this point for our purpose. The problem has been how to preservethe sympathetic, sensitive rapport and to lay the basis for the higher,inclusive identification, and yet at the same time preserve a spiritualdetachment which will enable the disciple to do his needed work, unhampered andunimpeded by the distress, the anxiety or the thought activity evoked by theminds and the desires of those with whom he is working.The necessary detachment cannot be based upon the innate instinct ofself-preservation, even when that is carried into the realm of the soul; it mustbe motivated by an occult absorption in the task, and implemented by the willwhich keeps the channel of contact open between the disciple and the ashram andbetween the disciple and his sphere of activity; this channel must be keptentirely clear of all lower identifications. This might be termed a method ofeliminating all tendencies to register anything save a wise apprehension of thepoint in evolution of those contacted; a sound appreciation of the problem to befaced on their behalf, and a process of directing the needed energy of love insuch a manner that the stream of projected love not only aids the recipient, butprotects the disciple from undue contact; it will then evoke in the person to behelped, or the group to be aided, no reciprocal personality expression; instead,it lifts the entire quality of the personality life or the group life on thepurificatory way on to higher levels of awareness.A great part of the work to be done by the disciples who are emerging from theashrams, and will continue thus to emerge, is of a purificatory nature at thistime, and increasingly so for the rest of this century. On the Path ofProbation, the aspirant is taught to purify himself and his three vehicles ofcontact; upon acceptance into an ashram, a large measure of the neededpurification has been achieved. From then on, no emphasis should be laid by thedisciple on the purification of his own nature, for this would produce too closeand intimate a self-focus and tend to an over-stimulation of the personalityvehicles. But the lessons learnt upon the [692] Probationary Path will be foundby him to be simply the foundation for the Science of Purification or—if I mayuse a word made familiar to you through the war experience—of De-contamination.This will be brought into full expression by the working disciples who will beresponsible for the preparation of the world for the reappearance. Thispurificatory process falls into the following stages:1. The stage wherein the tainted area, the hidden evil, or the diseased factorsare recognised and duly contacted in order to ascertain the extent of thepurificatory measures required. This is a point of danger for the disciple.2. The process of discovering the magnetic areas, magnetised in past centuries,and even aeons, by Members of the Hierarchy. This is done so as to makeavailable the transmission of energies there stored. In the cycle which is nowclose at hand, these magnetic centres will be largely tapped or utilised by theworld disciples responsible for the purificatory work.3. The stage wherein the disciple withdraws his attention from the source ofdifficulty and concentrates upon certain mantric usages and certain hierarchicalformulas, thus setting loose the energies needed to destroy the germs of evil,latent or active, thus eliminating certain materialistic tendencies, andstrengthening the soul of all that is to be purified and the life to be foundwithin every form. It is wise to remember that, for instance, as the Masterworks with His disciples and strengthens the life within them and evokes theirsoul into potency from latency, every form and every atom within their variousbodies is equally energised and aided. It is this fundamental process which willguide the disciples and the initiates in the coming work of world purification.4. The stage of withdrawing of the purifying energies; this is to be followed bya period of stabilising the purified form and starting the life and soul withinit on a new cycle of spiritual growth.[693] I have worded all this in such a manner that it will be evident that thework to be done is not confined only to humanity, but also to the forms of lifein the other kingdoms in nature.The study of this Science of Applied Purification is one which is engrossing theattention of all the ashrams at this time; disciples in the first ray ashram, inthe second ray ashram and in the seventh ray ashram are peculiarly active alongthese lines, for the destruction of evil is the work of the first ray, and in sodestroying its effects purity is achieved; the fostering of good then becomespossible and is the work of the second ray, of the Builders; and the bringing ofspiritual energy into contact with substance, and consequently with matter, isthe unique work of the seventh ray because it is now in manifestation. The rayswhich are active and in manifestation at this time and in this cycle are therein conformity to the Plan and in preparation for the externalisation of theHierarchy and the reappearance of the Christ. These rays are particularlyinvolved, and therefore the initiates and the disciples in the ashrams of theMasters are also particularly implicated.The Science of Applied Purification is also the Science of Applied Energy, withthe specific objective in view of “eliminating the undesirable and that whichhinders the entrance of the light, and thus providing space and entry for thedesired, for the good, the beautiful and the true”. In the application of thisscience there is of course no infringement of the human prerogative of freewill. This ancient science is concerned primarily with the purification and withthe redemption of matter, and it is entirely in the hands of human beings, underthe direction of the Hierarchy. This direction may be consciously orunconsciously registered. The Science of Redemption (to which I have severaltimes earlier referred) is in reality the applied art of esotericism and ofspiritual living which is already being taught to mankind; they are steadilylearning to redeem the bodies through which they function. It is in reality theart or science of relationship [694] between the Life and the lives, as H.P.B.expresses it.As far as the other kingdoms in nature are concerned, the purification isapplied by the Hierarchy, through the medium of human beings, and this can beseen in process at this time. This present activity, carried on now largelyunconsciously, will be redoubled and carried forward consciously by trainedinitiates and disciples, working through and with aspirants. It is this that isnow being studied in the various hierarchical ashrams, and when applied—after1975—will bring about great and important changes in world living.Another matter to which the Hierarchy is at this time attending, in view of thecoming adjustments required, is the discovery of aspirants and those who areclose to accepted discipleship in all lands, in order that the language problemwill present little difficulty. Having discovered such people, Their next stepis to subject them to a process of training in telepathic susceptibility, sothat they will be sensitive to hierarchical impression. At the same time, theirintuition will require stimulation but—as the intuition is useless andinaccessible without a high grade intelligence—all these people must be soughtfor upon mental levels. The possession of the abstract mind is not sufficient.It is useful, in that it guarantees the ability of the aspirant to construct theantahkarana; it is nevertheless quite possible to possess a well developedabstract consciousness and yet to be quite devoid of all intuitive perception.For example, this is the major limitation of Z.... He is a sound abstractthinker and they are somewhat rare, being usually impractical idealists. He isnot, however, the least intuitive as yet. He could easily be—given certainneeded surrenders.Basically speaking, the intuition is not the revealer of esoteric truths. Theycome along another line of spiritual perception. The intuition is essentiallythe organ of group perception and that which eventually elevates the personalityto its rightful position as the agent of the Soul in the group . [695] Z ... hasa sound theory as to group attitudes and group work, and he will be exceedinglysurprised at these comments of mine. But—as long as he insulates himself fromwarm group contacts and fails to seek (in the name of service) the love of thegroup, and as long as he fails to recognise error and his own part in anycurrent mistakes whenever they occur, and as long as he transfers responsibilityto others when he is himself to blame, he will fail to register intuitiveinformation, because his personality reactions will intervene. He must not bedeceived by the fact that people like him on the platform; that is group work,but not essentially working with the group. He must learn that at present he isthe onlooker at the group and as yet not a part of it, and that he is primarilyfocussed on “delivering the goods” (if I may use your American phrase) to hispersonality and its acclaim, and not to the group. This will be hard for him torealise and he must be given time. He wants to make good, spiritually andesoterically, but needs to grasp the fact that this is done through love andunderstanding and not through the intellect. He is insulated by his own strongdesire to make good, according to his own theories and to his personality, thusproving to himself the grasp his soul may have over that personality. Thiscreates barriers, but the insulating and separating wall between him and hisco-workers is very thin and could easily be “rent in twain,” if his pride wouldpermit and if he would descend to a recognition of equality with all the groupwith whom he is associated, and with the most unimportant members of that group;this he does not yet do—in spite of what he believes about himself.The searchlight of the Hierarchy is sweeping the planet at this time singlingout men and women, here and there, from the mass of men. They indicate esotericpossibility, and in their lives love of humanity and love of the Christ is abasic and fundamental factor.The ordinary devoted person, who constantly pledges and dedicates himself to theChrist or to the Masters in a spirit of adoration, will not be chosen for thisspecific training. Their own attitudes and development come violently [696]between them and their objective. The man who forgets about himself, and who ismore interested in helping unhappy human beings, but who is neverthelessstaunchly convinced of the factor of the unseen worlds, is the man for whomsearch is at this time being made.When these men and women are found, the work of the discovering initiate is tosee to it that information comes to the aspirant in some form or another anentthe hierarchical Plan, concerning the reappearance of the Christ (under somename familiar to the aspirant’s religious background), and about the fundamentaland needed occult truths—with particular emphasis upon the Law of Cause andEffect, and secondarily upon the Law of Rebirth. The Law of Cause and Effect isof far greater importance than the Law of Rebirth, because it necessitatesaction upon the part of the aspirant, and that action inevitably conditions thefuture. There is nothing he can do about the Law of Rebirth but submit to it andbe grateful that opportunity continues to present itself.As regards the many other adjustments which Members of the Hierarchy in allTheir many differing grades will have to make in what might be called Theirpersonality lives and habits, I have naught to say. I know well the questionswhich will arise in your minds, and I would like to touch upon one or two ofthem. For instance, some of you are asking:1. How will these Members of the Hierarchy in Their various grades appear onearth? Will They come through the methods of ordinary birth, of childhood andmaturity? Some initiates may follow this ordinary pattern, some are alreadypassing through it today and are in the stages of infancy and adolescence; tothem will be given a large share of the preparatory work. Some will not passthrough these relatively limiting phases, but will pass back and forth betweenthe outer world and the world of hierarchical endeavour; they will be sometimespresent in physical bodies and sometimes not. This method of activity will notbe possible as long as [697] the present rules of national and civilianidentification, of passports and of drastic airport and seaport inspection arerequired by the authorities; such people as these “transitting initiates” wouldnot be able to identify themselves. This form of appearance is thereforepostponed for some time. Some of the Masters will create what is called in thelanguage of the East the “mayavirupa”—a vehicle of expression which is built ofatomic physical and astral substance and of concrete mental substance. This Theycan create at will, use at will and cause to vanish at will; Their problem isnot, therefore, so acute in the matter of appearing and of reappearing as isthat of the initiate who cannot thus create to suit his purpose and his service.2. Will all the Members of the Hierarchy make Their appearance at the same time?Certainly not. The appearing of these initiates and Masters will begin withisolated members appearing and living among men, coming forth one by one, doingthe required work, returning through the portals of apparent death to the innersubjective Ashram, and then again appearing by one or other of the methodsmentioned above. This process has been going on for some time and began aroundthe year 1860. The work of these disciples in the human consciousness is alreadybeing recognised, and already they have succeeded in changing the consciousnessand the thinking of many millions. Their ideas are already permeating worldthinking. I would remind you also (for your encouragement) that I myself amamong this number of working initiates (for, in the last analysis, that is allthat any Master is), and that I, from my physical anchorage, i.e., my physicalbody and my location in northern India, and in collaborating with a disciple,A.A.B., and also with F.B., have done much to bring certain concepts (old andyet new in their presentation) to the consciousness of humanity. I have alsodone much to stimulate from latency to potency the instinctual goodwill of men.I mention this for this is not a unique achievement; there are many otherMasters Who—with Their [698] disciples—are to be found today activelyfunctioning in human affairs and struggling, under adverse conditions, to changethe trend of human thinking from a frank materialism to a genuine spiritualaspiration.There are many other questions arising in the minds of my readers, and the lessadvanced they are the greater the questioning and the greater the emphasis uponthe materialistic, and therefore non-important, aspects of this entire subject.With them I have no intention of dealing, though I know well what they are, andso does A.A.B. They are of no vitality, and will answer themselves in due time.When the task of the preparation of men’s minds is further advanced, when theknowledge of the existence of the Masters and Their hierarchical endeavour andof the united Hierarchy of our planet are a commonly recognised truth, and whenactive goodwill is recognised as a real national asset in all lands, then thespeed of the externalisation of the Hierarchy will be greatly increased; thenthe five spiritual centres will begin to take definite form, and will call alsofor recognition; the groups there working will be known, and they will also bein close touch with each other. From that time on, the network of initiates anddisciples under the direction of the Masters will be worldwide, and in everyfield of human expression the opinion of these men and women, and of the Masterspresiding at the five centres and in Their affiliated groups, will be regardedas of immense value by all governmental, economic and social organisations.Then—under a great wave of spiritual inspiration—the divine spirit of expectancyfor the reappearance of the Christ will sweep through the world; it will then beregarded as credible and creditable, and His coming will provide the germ forall world hope; the reason for this will be that the most respected, enlightenedand cultured people on the planet will be looking for Him. And then, mybrothers, He will come, bringing new energies of love and compassion andimplementing the spirit of fresh enlightenment; to [699] these important eventsmust also be added the new revelation for which all men wait and to which theywill be able to respond, owing to the needed and new stimulation.Many who are reading this section of my instructions will be disappointed (sofutile and silly is the human mind in so many cases) because I do not choose toconsider now the means whereby the Members of the Hierarchy will adjustThemselves to modern living conditions, as to what food They will eat andwhether They will marry or not marry. One thing only will I say: They will takemodern life and what it means and will proceed to demonstrate how that life (thenormal product of the evolutionary process) can be lived divinely; They willexpress the highest ideal of marriage (I would here remind you that many of theMasters are married and have raised families) and demonstrate the principlewhich underlies the perpetuation of the race of men; They will also show how alllife is one life, that the form nature is ever a sacrificial unity in the vastscheme of divine manifestation; They will show us also that whatever we do,whether we eat or drink, all must be done under correct, temperate and naturallaw and in a spirit of loving understanding, and ever to the glory of God. Theywill express ordered, temperate living in all things, and will demonstrate alsothe possibility of the existence of people on earth who have no wronginclinations and no bad qualities in their natures. They will stand forth asliving examples of goodwill, of true love, of intelligent applied wisdom, ofhigh good nature and humour, and of normalcy. They may indeed be so normal thatrecognition of what They are may escape notice.They will, finally, demonstrate to all around Them the significance of rightmotive, the beauty of selfless service and a vivid intellectual perception.This, my brothers, is such a platitudinous statement, from the point of view ofthe nice well-meaning person, that its value may escape your attention. Yet itis a statement that, any initiate will tell you, warrants your closest attentionand consideration—a [700] consideration which must be followed by an effort toexpress these same qualities upon your way towards the Door of Initiation.The Work of the Externalised AshramsThe barest outline must here suffice. I have dealt with the proposed work of theexternalised Ashrams at some length in the foregoing pages and also in severalof my other books, (Letters on Occult Meditation, Letters VIII and IX. ATreatise on Cosmic Fire, Pages 747-760. A Treatise on the Seven Rays,” Volume V:(“The Rays and the Initiations”)) and a more detailed presentation will not bepossible at this time. The approaching externalisation will bring about anincreased stimulation which will necessarily affect disciples and aspirants andwill involve a period of adjustment to this higher vibration. Adjustment to theincreased livingness will be facilitated by the enunciation of certain basicstatements for the guidance of disciples, aspirants and people of goodwill.Specifically, the externalised Ashrams will be active along four major lines:1. Creating and vitalising the new world religion.2. The gradual reorganising of the social order—an order free from oppression,the persecution of minorities, materialism and pride.3. The public inauguration of the system of initiation. This will involve thegrowth and comprehension of symbolism.4. The exoteric training of disciples and of humanity in this new cycle.Meanwhile, what is it that you, my brothers, must do in this interim period?What is your work and your goal? Let me emphasise one or two points:The material goal which all who love their fellowmen and serve the Hierarchymust ever have in mind and at [701] heart is the defeat of totalitarianism. I donot say the defeat of Communism, but the defeat of that evil process whichinvolves the imposition of ideas, and which can be the method of the democraticnations and of the churches everywhere, just as much as it is the method of theU.S.S.R. This we call totalitarianism. I would ask you to have this distinctionclearly in your minds. Your material goal is the defeat of all that infringeshuman free will and which keeps humanity in ignorance; it applies equally to anyestablished system—Catholic or Protestant—which imposes its concepts and itswill upon its adherents. Totalitarianism is the basis of evil today; it is foundin all systems of government, of education; it is found in the home and in thecommunity. I refer not here to the laws which make group relations sound,possible and right; such laws are essential to community and national well-beingand are not totalitarian in nature. I refer to the imposition of the will of thefew upon the total mass of the people. The defeat of this undesirable tendencyeverywhere is your definite material goal.Your spiritual goal is the establishing of the Kingdom of God. One of the firststeps towards this is to prepare men’s minds to accept the fact that thereappearance of the Christ is imminent. You must tell men everywhere that theMasters and Their groups of disciples are actively working to bring order out ofchaos. You must tell them that there IS a Plan, and that nothing can possiblyarrest the working out of that Plan. You must tell them that the Hierarchystands, and that It has stood for thousands of years, and is the expression ofthe accumulated wisdom of the ages. You must tell them above all else that Godis love, that the Hierarchy is love, and that Christ is coming because He loveshumanity.This is the message which you must give at this time. And with thisresponsibility I leave you.
