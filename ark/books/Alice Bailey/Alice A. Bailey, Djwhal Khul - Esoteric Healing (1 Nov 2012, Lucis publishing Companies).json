I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity—not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings a flashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

BAILEY"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTORY REMARKS[1] The entire subject of healing is as old as the ages themselves, and has everbeen the subject of investigation and experiment. But as to the right use of thehealing faculty and forces, the knowledge is in its infancy. Only in this ageand generation is it at last possible to impart the laws of magnetic healing,and to indicate the causes of those diseases—originating in the three innerbodies—which today devastate the human frame, cause endless suffering and pain,and usher man through the portal which leads to the world of bodiless existence.Only today is man at the point in the evolution of his consciousness where hecan begin to realise the power of the subjective worlds, and the new and vastscience of psychology is his response to this growing interest. Processes ofadjustment, of elimination and of cure engage the minds of all thoughtful peopleas well as of all suffering people. We have much to do, and I ask therefore forpatience on your part.When one enters the realm of healing, one enters a world of much esotericknowledge, and of an infinity of conclusions, and one is faced with theformulations of many minds, who, through the ages, have sought to heal and tohelp. The why and the wherefore of disease have been the subject of endlessinvestigations and speculations, and much definite deduction has been made as tothe cures of such complaints; there has been also much formulation of methods,of techniques, of formulae, of prescription, of varied manipulations and of [2]theories. All these serve to fill the mind with many ideas—some correct, someerroneous—and this makes it most difficult for new ideas to enter and for thestudent to assimilate the hitherto unknown.Aspirants lose much by refusing to let go of that which the lower mindcherishes. When they do succeed in being entirely open minded and are ready toaccept the new theories and hypotheses, they discover that the old and dearlyheld truth is not really lost, but only relegated to its rightful place in alarger scheme.All initiates of the Ageless Wisdom are necessarily healers, though all may notheal the physical body. The reason for this is that all souls that have achievedany measure of true liberation are transmitters of spiritual energy. Thisautomatically affects some aspect of the mechanism which is used by the soulsthey contact. When I employ the word “mechanism” in these instructions I referto different aspects of the instrument, the body or form nature, through whichall souls seek manifestation. I refer, therefore, to:1. The dense physical body , which is the sumtotal of all the organisms whichcompose it; these possess the varying functions which enable the soul to expressitself on the physical or objective plane as part of a greater and moreinclusive organism. The physical body is the response apparatus of theindwelling spiritual man and serves to put that spiritual entity en rapport withthe response apparatus of the planetary Logos, the Life in which we live andmove and have our being.2. The etheric body, which has one main objective. This is to vitalise andenergise the physical body and thus integrate it into the energy body of theEarth and of the solar system. It is a web of energy streams, of lines of forceand of light. It constitutes part of the vast network [3] of energies whichunderlies all forms whether great or small (microcosmic or macrocosmic). Alongthese lines of energy the cosmic forces flow, as the blood flows through theveins and arteries. This constant, individual—human, planetary andsolar—circulation of life-forces through the etheric bodies of all forms is thebasis of all manifested life, and the expression of the essentialnon-separateness of all life.3. The astral or desire body (sometimes called the emotional body) is the effectof the interplay of desire and of sentient response upon the self at the centre,and the resultant effect—in that body—is experienced as emotion and as pain andpleasure and the other pairs of opposites. In these two bodies, the etheric andastral bodies, ninety percent of the causes of physical disease and troubles isto be found.4. The mental body , or that much of the chitta or mind stuff which anindividual human unit can use and impress, constitutes the fourth of the seriesof mechanisms at the disposal of the soul. At the same time let it not beforgotten that these four constitute one mechanism. Five percent of all moderndisease originates in this body or state of consciousness, and here I wish toenunciate the truth that the constant reiteration by certain schools of healersthat the mind is the cause of all sickness is not as yet a fact. A million yearshence, when the focus of human attention has shifted from the emotional natureto the mind, and when men are essentially mental as today they are essentiallyemotional, then the causes of disease must be sought in the mind realm. They aretoday to be found (except in a few rare cases) in lack of vitality or in toomuch stimulation, and in the realm of feeling, of desires (thwarted orover-indulged) and in the moods, suppressions, or expressions of the deep-seated[4] longings, irritations, secret delights and the many hidden impulses whichemanate from the desire life of the subject.This urge to be and to have has first of all built, and is building, the outerphysical response apparatus, and is today forcing a mechanism that has beenconstructed essentially for physical ends, to serve more subjective purposes.This again produces trouble, and only when man realises that within the outerphysical sheath there exist other bodies which serve more subtle responsepurposes will we see the gradual readjustment and health of the physical body.With these more subtle sheaths we shall later deal.You naturally ask here: What is the general plan which I shall seek to follow asI instruct you in the laws of healing, those laws which guide the initiates andmust gradually supersede the more physical methods of the present art ofhealing? You naturally also seek to know what is the special technique whichyou—as healers—must learn to employ, both as regards yourselves and as regardsthose you seek to heal. I will briefly outline the teaching I shall endeavour togive and point out where you must lay the emphasis, as you commence the study ofthis subject.I shall endeavour first of all to touch upon the causes of disease, for theoccult student must ever begin in the world of origins and not in the world ofeffects.In the second place, I shall elaborate the seven methods of healing which governthe “work of restitution” (as it is called in the occult terminology) aspracticed by the initiates of the world. These determine the techniques whichmust be employed. You will note that these methods and techniques areconditioned by the rays (of which I have written in A Treatise on the Seven RaysVol I & Vol II ) and that therefore the healer has to take into [5]consideration not only his own ray but also the ray of the patient. There aretherefore seven ray techniques, and these require elucidation before they can beapplied intelligently.In the third place, I shall lay emphasis upon psychological healing and upon theneed to deal with the patient in his inner life, for the basic law underlyingall occult healing may be stated to be as follows:LAW IAll disease is the result of inhibited soul life, and that is true of all formsin all kingdoms. The art of the healer consists in releasing the soul, so thatits life can flow through the aggregate of organisms which constitute anyparticular form.It is interesting to note that the attempt of the scientist to release theenergy of the atom is of the same general nature as the work of the esotericistwhen he endeavours to release the energy of the soul. In this release the natureof the true art of healing is hidden. Herein lies an occult hint.In the fourth place, we will consider the physical body, its diseases and ills,but only after we have studied that part of man which lies behind andsurrounding the dense physical body. In that way we shall work from the world ofinner causes to the world of outer happenings. We shall see that all thatconcerns the health of man originates from:1. The sumtotal of forces, feelings, desires and occasional mental processeswhich characterises the three subtler bodies and determines the life andexperience of the physical body.2. The effect upon the physical body of the condition of humanity as a whole . Ahuman being is an integral part of humanity, an organism in a greater organism.Conditions existing in the whole will be reflected in [6] the unit self, andmany of the ills from which man suffers today are the effect upon him ofconditions existing in the fourth kingdom in nature as a whole. For these he isnot held responsible.3. The effect upon his physical body of the planetary life, which is theexpression of the life of the planetary Logos, Who is an evolving Entity. Theimplications of this are largely beyond our ken, but the effects arediscernible.I am not interested primarily in training individuals in order to make them moreefficient healers. It is group healing at which I aim, and it is the work whichis done in formation which interests me at this time. But no group of people canwork as a unit unless they love and serve each other. The healing energy of thespiritual Hierarchy cannot flow through the group if there is disharmony andcriticism. The first work, therefore, of any group of healers, is to establishthemselves in love and to work towards group unity and understanding.I would like to point out here the need for patience as a healing groupintegrates and the auras of the group members blend. It takes a little time forpeople to learn to work together in perfect understanding and impersonality ,and at the same time to achieve, during their work, a one-pointedness which willproduce the needed group rhythm—a rhythm of such unity and intensity that thework can synchronise internally. Aspirants and students as they work along theselines must train themselves to think as a group, and to give to the group(without a niggardly or reticent spirit) the best that is in them, and also thefruit of their meditation upon these matters.I might also add that these instructions must be as concise as possible. I shallhave to endeavour to put much truth [7] and information into a brief space, soas to make each sentence convey some real idea and give some real light on theproblems which confront a healing group. That which I have to say will fall intotwo parts: First, we will deal with the general work of healing and teaching,and this will involve the impartation by me of laws, of techniques and methods.Secondly, we will consider the healer and how he can perfect himself in the artof healing.Is it not true that the prime requisite of all healers is a sympathetic rapportwith the patient, so that the healer achieves insight into the trouble andestablishes the confidence of the patient?Two words I give you which embody the requirements of all true healers, andtowards which you must work. They are Magnetism and Radiation . A healer must bemagnetic above everything else, and he must attract to him:a. The power of his own soul; this involves alignment through individualmeditation.b. Those whom he can help; this involves a decentralised attitude.c. Those energies, when need arises, which will stimulate the patient to thedesired activity. This involves occult knowledge and a trained mind.The healer must understand also how to radiate, for the radiation of the soulwill stimulate to activity the soul of the one to be healed and the healingprocess will be set in motion; the radiation of his mind will illumine the othermind and polarise the will of the patient; the radiation of his astral body,controlled and selfless, will impose a rhythm upon the agitation of thepatient’s astral body, and so enable the patient to take right action, whilstthe radiation of the vital body, working through the splenic centre, will aid in[8] organising the patient’s force-body and so facilitate the work of healing.Therefore, the healer has the duty of rendering himself effective, and accordingto what he is, so will be the effect upon the patient. When a healer worksmagnetically and radiates his soul force to the patient, that patient is enabledmore easily to achieve the end desired—which may be complete healing, or it maybe the establishing of a state of mind which will enable the patient to livewith himself and with his complaint, unhandicapped by the karmic limitations ofthe body. Or it may be enabling the patient to achieve (with joy and facility)the right liberation from the body and, through the portal of death, to pass tocomplete health."},{"pageContent":"PART ONE - THE BASIC CAUSES OF DISEASE[9] This is the problem with which all medical practice down the ages haswrestled. In our present mechanistic age we have wandered far to the surface ofthings and away from the partially true point of view of earlier centuries whichtraced disease back of the “evil humours” bred and festering in the innersubjective life of the patient. In the evolution of knowledge on every hand weare now on the surface of things (note I do not use the word “superficial”), andthe hour has struck in which knowledge can again re-enter the realm of thesubjective and transmute itself into wisdom. There is today a dawningrecognition on the part of the best minds in the medical and allied professions,that in the subjective and hidden attitudes of the mind and of the emotionalnature, and in the life of inhibited or excessive sex expression, must be soughtthe causes of all disease.From the beginning of our studies, I would like to point out that the ultimatecause of disease, even if known to me, would fail to be comprehended by you. Thecause lies back in the history of the distant past of our planet, in the career(occultly understood) of the planetary Life, and that it has its roots in whatis largely designated “cosmic evil.” This is a perfectly meaningless phrase, butone that is symbolically descriptive of a condition in consciousness which isthat of [10] certain of the “imperfect Gods.” Given the initial premise thatDeity itself is working towards a perfection past our comprehension, it may beinferred that there may exist for the Gods Themselves and for GOD (as the LIFEof the solar system), certain limitations and certain areas or states ofconsciousness which still await mastering. These limitations and relativeimperfections may cause definite effects in Their bodies of manifestation—thevarious planets as expressions of Lives, and the solar system as the expressionof a LIFE. Given also the hypothesis that these outer bodies of divinity, theplanets, are the forms through which certain Deities express Themselves, it maybe a true and logical deduction that all lives and forms within those bodies maybe necessarily subject also to these limitations, and to the imperfectionsgrowing out of these unconquered areas of consciousness and these states ofawareness, hitherto unrealised by the Deities, incarnated in planetary and solarform. Given the postulate that every form is a part of a still greater form, andthat we do indeed “live and move and have our being” within the body of God (asSt. Paul expresses it) we, as integral parts of the fourth kingdom in nature,share in this general limitation and imperfection.More than this general premise is beyond our powers to grasp and to express, forthe general mental equipment of the average aspirant and disciple is inadequateto the task. Such terms as “cosmic evil, divine imperfection, limited areas ofconsciousness, the freedom of pure spirit, divine mind,” which are so freelybandied about by the mystical and occult thinkers of the time: What do theyreally mean? The affirmations of many schools of healing as to ultimate divineperfection, and the formulation of their beliefs in the real freedom of humanityfrom ordinary ills of the flesh, are they not frequently high sounding phrases,embodying an ideal, and based often on selfish desire? Do they not constitute[11] utterly meaningless sentences in their mystical implications? How can it beotherwise, when only the perfected man has any real idea of what constitutesdivinity?It is surely better for us to admit that it is not possible for man tounderstand the deep-seated causes of that which can be seen emerging in theevolution of form life. Is it not wise to face the issue and the facts, as theyexist for our present realisation, and understand that just as man can entermore intelligently into the mind of God than can the lesser mind of the animal,so there may exist other and greater Minds, functioning in other and higherkingdoms in nature which will surely see life more truly and more accuratelythan does mankind? It is possible, is it not, that the objective of evolution(as outlined and emphasised by man) may (in the last analysis) be only thatpartial fragment of a greater objective than he, with his finite understanding,can grasp. The whole intent, as it lies hid in the mind of God, may be verydifferent to what man may conceive today, and cosmic evil and cosmic good,reduced to terminologies, may lose their significance altogether, and are onlyto be seen through the glamour and the illusion with which man surrounds allthings. The best minds of this age are only just beginning to see the first dimray of light which is piercing this glamour, and serving first of all to revealthe fact of illusion. Through the light thus cast, the following truth may standrevealed to those who have the expectant attitude and the open mind: Deityitself is on the road towards perfection. The implications of that statement aremany.In dealing with the causes of disease, we will take the position that thefoundational and ultimate cosmic cause lies beyond our comprehension, and thatonly as the kingdom of God is revealed on earth shall we enter into some realunderstanding of the general widespread disease to be found upon our planet inall the four kingdoms in nature. A few [12] basic statements can be made,however, which will be found true eventually in the macrocosmic sense, and canalready be demonstrated to be true where the microcosm is intelligentlyconcerned.1. All disease (and this is a platitude) is caused by lack of harmony—adisharmony to be found existing between the form aspect and the life. That whichbrings together form and life, or rather, that which is the result of thisintended union, we call the soul, the self where humanity is concerned, and theintegrating principle where the subhuman kingdoms are concerned. Disease appearswhere there is a lack of alignment between these various factors, the soul andthe form, the life and its expression, the subjective and the objectiverealities. Consequently, spirit and matter are not freely related to each other.This is one mode of interpreting Law I, and the entire thesis is intended to bean exposition of that Law.2. This lack of harmony, producing what we call disease, runs through all thefour kingdoms in nature, and causes those conditions which produce pain (wherethe sentiency is exquisite and developed) and everywhere congestion, corruptionand death. Ponder on these words: Inharmony, Disease, Pain, Congestion,Corruption, Death, for they are descriptive of the general condition governingthe conscious life of all forms, macrocosmic and microcosmic. They are notcauses.3. All these conditions, however, can be regarded as purificatory in theireffects, and must be so regarded by humanity if the right attitude towardsdisease is to be assumed. This is oft forgotten by the fanatical healer and bythe radical exponent of an idea, finitely grasped and in most cases only part ofa greater idea. [13]4. Methods of healing and techniques of alleviation are peculiar to humanity andare the result of man’s mental activity. They indicate his latent power as acreator, and as one who progresses towards freedom. They indicate hisdiscriminative ability to sense perfection, to vision the goal, and hence towork towards that ultimate liberation. His error at this time consists in:a. His inability to see the true uses of pain.b. His resentment at suffering.c. His misunderstanding of the law of nonresistance.d. His over-emphasis of the form nature.e. His attitude to death, and his feeling that the disappearance of the life outof visual perception through the medium of form, and the consequentdisintegration of that form, indicates disaster.5. When human thought reverses the usual ideas as to disease, and acceptsdisease as a fact in nature, man will begin to work with the law of liberation,with right thought, leading to nonresistance. At present, by the power of hisdirected thought and his intense antagonism to disease, he only tends toenergise the difficulty. When he reorients his thought to truth and the soul,physical plane ills will begin to disappear. This will become apparent as westudy later the method of eradication. Disease exists. Forms in all kingdoms arefull of inharmony and out of alignment with the indwelling life. Disease andcorruption and the tendency towards dissolution are found everywhere. I amchoosing my words with care.6. Disease is not, therefore, the result of wrong human thought. It existedamong the many forms of life long before the human family appeared on earth. Ifyou seek verbal expression, and if you want to talk within the limits of thehuman mind, you can say with a measure of accuracy: God, [14] the planetaryDeity, is guilty of wrong thinking. But you will not be expressing the truth,but only a tiny fraction of the cause, as it appears to your feeble finite mind,through the medium of the general world glamour and illusion.7. From one angle, disease is a process of liberation, and the enemy of thatwhich is static and crystallised. Think not, from what I say, that thereforedisease should be welcomed, and that the process of death should be cherished.Were that the case, one would cultivate disease and put a premium on suicide.Fortunately for humanity, the whole tendency of life is against disease, and thereaction of the form life upon the thought of man fosters the fear of death.This has been rightly so, for the instinct of self-preservation and thepreservation of form integrity is a vital principle in matter, and the tendencyto self-perpetuation of the life within the form is one of our greatestGod-given capacities and will persist. But in the human family this musteventually give place to the use of death as the organised, freeing process inorder to conserve force and give to the soul a better instrument ofmanifestation. For this liberty of action, mankind as a whole is not yet ready.The disciples and aspirants of the world should now, however, begin to graspthese newer principles of existence. The instinct to self-preservation governsthe relation of spirit and matter, of life and form as long as the Deity Himselfwills to incarnate within His body of manifestation—a planet, or a solar system.I have in the above statement given to you a hint as to one of the basic causesof disease, and to the endless fight between the imprisoned spirit and theimprisoning form. This fight uses for its method that innate quality whichexpresses itself as the urge to preserve and the urge to perpetuate—both thepresent form and the species. [15]8. The law of cause and effect, called Karma in the East, governs all this.Karma must be regarded in reality as the effect (in the form life of our planet)of causes, deep-seated and hidden in the mind of God. The causes that we maytrace in relation to disease and death are in reality only the working out ofcertain basic principles which govern—rightly or wrongly, who shall say?—thelife of God in form, and they must ever remain incomprehensible to man untilsuch time as he takes the great initiation which is symbolised for us in theTransfiguration. All along in our studies, we shall be dealing with secondarycauses and their effects, with the phenomenal results of those subjectiveeffects which emanate from causes too far away for us to grasp. This should beadmitted and grasped. This is the best man can do with his present mentalapparatus. When the intuition rarely works, and the mind is seldom illumined,why should man arrogantly expect to understand everything? Let him work at thedevelopment of his intuition and at achieving illumination. Understanding maythen come his way. He will have earned the right to divine knowledge. But theabove recognition will suffice for our work and will enable us to lay down thoselaws and principles which will indicate the way humanity may gain release fromthe form consciousness and consequent immunity from the victory of death andthose disease-dealing conditions which govern today our planetary manifestation.We will divide our consideration of the causes of disease into three parts,eliminating from our quest for truth the quite understandable but equally futiledesire to apprehend the mind of Deity.I. The psychological causes.II. Causes emanating from group life.III. Our karmic liabilities, the karmic causes.[16] In all this we shall but gain a general idea (all that is now possible) asto the presence of disease in the human family, and of that to be found also, inpart, in the animal kingdom. When this general idea is grasped, we shall have aclearer understanding of our problem and can then proceed with our considerationof the methods which will enable us to handle the undesirable effects withgreater facility. Students of the Art of Healing should likewise remember thatthere are three ways in which healing can be brought about, and that all threeways have their place and value, dependent upon the point in evolution of thesubject being healed.First, there is the application of those palliatives and ameliorating methodswhich gradually cure disease and eliminate undesirable conditions; they build upthe form life and foster the vitality, so that disease can be thrown off. Ofthese methods the allopathic and the homeopathic schools and the variousosteopathic and chiropractic and other therapeutic schools are good exponents.They have done much good and constructive work, and the debt of humanity to thewisdom, skill and unselfish attentions of the physicians is great. They aredealing all the time with urgent conditions and dangerous effects of causeswhich are not apparent on the surface. Under these methods, the patient is inthe hands of an outside party, and should be passive, quiescent and negative.Secondly, there is the appearance of the work and methods of the modernpsychologist, who seeks to deal with subjective conditions and to straighten outthose wrong attitudes of mind, those inhibitions, psychoses, and complexes whichbring about the outer states or disease, the morbid conditions and neurotic andmental disasters. Under this method, the patient is taught to cooperate as muchas he can with the psychologist, so that he may arrive at a proper [17]understanding of himself, and so learn to eradicate those inner compellingsituations which are responsible for the outer results. He is trained to bepositive and active, and this is a great step in the right direction. Thetendency to combine psychology with the outer physical treatment is sound andright.Thirdly, the highest and the newest method is that of calling into positiveactivity a man’s own soul. The true and the future healing is brought about whenthe life of the soul can flow without any impediment and hindrance throughoutevery aspect of the form nature. It can then vitalise it with its potency, andcan also eliminate those congestions and obstructions which are such a fruitfulsource of disease.This gives you much to ponder upon. If we go slowly as regards the practicalapplication of techniques and methods, it is because I seek to lay a soundfoundation for that which I shall later impart.THE TRAINING OF THE HEALERAs regards the training of the healer, I will give from time to time the sixrules which govern (or should govern) his activity. Bear in mind the two wordswhich I earlier gave. They sum up the healer’s story: MAGNETISM and RADIATION.They are different in their effects as we shall later see.RULE ONEThe healer must seek to link his soul, his heart, his brain and his hands. Thuscan he pour the vital healing force upon the patient. This is magnetic work . Itcures disease, or may increase the so-called evil state, according to theknowledge of the healer.The healer must seek to link his soul, his brain, his heart and auric emanation.Thus can his presence feed the [18] soul life of the patient. This is the workof radiation. The hands are needed not. The soul displays its power. Thepatient’s soul responds through the response of his aura to the radiation of thehealer’s aura, flooded with soul energy.In considering the Causes of Disease, I find it necessary to speak a word inconnection with conditions—external and internal. It will be apparent to thecasual thinker that many diseases and many causes of death are due to environingconditions for which he is in no way responsible. These range all the way frompurely external occurrences to hereditary predispositions. They might be listedas follows:1. Accidents , which may be due to personal negligence, group happenings, thecarelessness of other people, and the results of fighting, as in labour strikesor war. They can also be brought about by attacks from the animal or the snakeworld, accidental poisonings and many other causes.2. Infections coming to a man from outside and not as the result of his ownpeculiar blood condition. Such infections are the various so-called infectiousand contagious diseases, and prevalent epidemics. These may come to a man in theline of duty, through his daily contacts, or through a widespread condition ofdisease in his environment.3. Diseases due to malnutrition , particularly when found in the young. Thisstate of undernourishment predisposes the body to disease, lowers the resistanceand the vitality, and of offsets the “fighting powers” of the man, leading topremature death.4. Heredity . There are, as you well know, certain forms of hereditaryweaknesses, which either predispose a person to certain illnesses and consequentdeath, or produce in him those conditions which lead to a steady weakening [19]of his hold on life; there are also those tendencies which constitute a form ofdangerous appetite, which lead to undesirable habits, a letting down of themorale, and are dangerous to the will of the person, rendering him futile tofight these predispositions. He succumbs to them and pays the price of suchhabits, which is disease and death.These four types of disease and causes of death account for much that we seehappening around us in people’s lives, but they are not to be classed definitelyunder any of the psychological causes of disease, and will only be considered,and that very briefly, under the section dealing with group life and itspredisposing causes of disease. Infectious diseases are there dealt with, butsuch situations as arise out of an automobile or railroad accident, forinstance, are not to be considered as coming under the heading of causesproducing disease. That the work of the healer may be involved in these cases isquite true, but the work to be done is somewhat different to that accomplishedwhen dealing with those diseases which have their roots in some subtle body orother, or in the results of group disease, etc. The ills growing out ofmalnutrition and the wrong feeding of our modern life and civilisation will nothere be considered. For these no child is individually responsible. I amconcerned with the diseases arising in wrong internal conditions.The responsibility of a child for his living conditions is practically nil,unless you admit karma as a predisposing factor, and its power to produce thosere-adjustments which emerge out of the past and affect the present. I shall dealwith this more fully under our third point, dealing with our karmic liabilities.I would only suggest here that the whole subject of disease could be treatedfrom the angle of karma and be definite and conclusive in its value [20] hadthere been right teaching on this abstruse subject from the time that it wasgiven out in the West. But the truth as it has come to us from the East has beenas much distorted by the Eastern theologian as the doctrines of the Atonementand of the Virgin Birth have been misinterpreted and taught by the Westerntheologian. The real truth bears little resemblance to our modern formulations.I am, therefore, seriously handicapped when dealing with the subject of diseasefrom the angle of karma. It is difficult for me to convey to you anything of thetruth as it really exists, owing to the pre-conceived ideas as to the ancientLaw of Cause and Effect which are necessarily in your mind. When I say to youthat the doctrine of Emergent Evolution and the modern theories of the work of acatalyst upon two substances which—when brought into relation with each otherunder the effect of the catalyst produce a third and different substance—carryin them much of the truth anent karma, will you understand? I question it. WhenI say to you that the emphasis given to the Law of Karma as it explains apparentinjustices and stresses always the appearance of pain, disease, and sufferinggives only partial presentation of the basic cosmic truth, is your mind in anyway clarified? When I point out that the Law of Karma, rightly understood andrightly wielded, can bring that which produces happiness, good, and freedom frompain more easily than it brings pain, with its chain of consequences, do youfeel able to grasp the significance of what I am saying?The world of glamour is at this time so strong and the sense of illusion sopotent and vital that we fail to see these basic laws in their truesignificance.The Law of Karma is not the Law of Retribution, as one would surmise as onereads the current books upon the subject; that is but one aspect of the workingof the Law [21] of Karma. The Law of Cause and Effect is not to be understood aswe now interpret it. There is, to illustrate, a law called the Law ofGravitation, which has long imposed itself upon the minds of men; such a lawexists, but it is only an aspect of a greater law, and its power can be, as weknow, relatively offset, for each time that we see an aeroplane soaringoverhead, we see a demonstration of the offsetting of this law by mechanicalmeans, symbolising the ease with which it can be surmounted by human beings. Ifthey could but realise it, they are learning the ancient technique of which thepower to levitate is one of the easiest and simplest initial exercises.The Law of Consequences is not the inevitable and set affair which modernthought surmises, but is related to the Laws of Thought far more closely thanhas been believed; towards an understanding of this, mental science has beengroping. Its orientation and purposes are right and good and hopeful of results;its conclusions and modes of work are at present woefully at fault, and mostmisleading.I have referred to this misunderstanding of the Law of Karma as I am anxious tohave you set out on this study of the Laws of Healing with a free and open mindas far as may be, realising that your understanding of these laws is limited by:1. Old theologies, with their static, distorted, and erroneous points of view.The teaching of theology is most misleading, but is, alas, generally accepted.2. World thought, strongly tinged with the desire element, and with little in itof real thought. Men interpret these dimly sensed laws in terms of finality andfrom their little point of view. The idea of retribution runs through much ofthe teaching on Karma, for instance, because men seek a plausible explanation ofthings as [22] they appear to be, and are themselves fond of dealing outretribution. Yet there is far more general good karma than bad, little as youmay think it when immersed in such a period as the present.3. The world illusion and glamour, which prevents the average and ignorant manfrom seeing life as it truly is. Even the advanced man and the disciples areonly beginning to get a fleeting and inadequate glance at a glorious reality.4. Uncontrolled minds and unreleased and unawakened brain cells also hinder manfrom correct realisation. This fact is often unrecognised. The apparatus ofrealisation is as yet inadequate. This point needs emphasising.5. National and racial temperaments, with their predisposing temperaments, andprejudices. These factors again prevent a just appreciation of these realities.I have given enough here to indicate to you the stupidity of attempting to statethat you understand these laws towards which you are groping and which you seekto understand. Nowhere in human thought is the darkness greater than inconnection with the laws concerning disease and death.It is necessary, therefore, to realise that, from the start, in all I have tosay, under the heading The Psychological Causes of Disease , I am not dealingwith those complaints or predispositions to disease which emerge out of theenvironment, or with those definitely physical taints which are inherited fromparents who have carried in their bodies and transmitted to their childrendisease germs which they, in their turn, may have inherited from their parents.I would like to point out that these inherited diseases are far fewer than is atpresent surmised; of these, the predisposition [23] to tuberculosis, to syphilisand to cancer are the most important where our present humanity is concerned;they are inherited and also can be imparted by contact. These I will deal withunder our second major heading on the diseases emanating from the group."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I - THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSES OF DISEASE[24] The point I would like to make here, before proceeding further, is that Ishall seek to avoid, as far as possible, all technicalities. Our theme is theesoteric consideration of disease and its forms; it seeks to elucidate thesubject of and the vital causes of such diseases, and to indicate the generallaws with which the healer must work and the six rules which he must impose uponhimself—and to which he gives obedience, through discipline and understanding.You will have noted that I listed the psychological causes under four headings:1. Those arising out of the emotional-feeling nature.2. Those which have their origin in the etheric body.3. Those which are based on wrong thought.4. The peculiar complaints and psychological troubles of disciples.It may have interested you to see that I place the ills of the etheric body inthe second place and not the first. The reason for this is that the group illsand diseases which have fastened upon the race, work primarily through theetheric body and find their way out into manifestation via the etheric bodies ofall forms. But I have placed them second, even though they are in the lastanalysis the most numerous, owing to the fact that humanity cannot as yet dealwith [25] these en masse. The approach has to be through individuals, and menmust clear their astral or emotional bodies of those conditions whichpre-dispose them to disease, as individuals. At present, the race is astrallypolarised. The emotional sentient nature is all-powerful in the masses. Thisleads to a relatively negative etheric body which is tuned in on the entireetheric substance of the planet. This substance, which underlies all forms, issimply a transferring and transmitting agency for vital energy to the outerdense physical body. Energy sweeps through this etheric substance, free from allcontrol by the individual human being, and quite unrealised by him because hisfocus of attention is astral. From the astral or emotional state ofconsciousness, much concerning individual physical conditions can be deduced. Wemust, however, eliminate those ills which are group ills and which have sweptinto and through all mankind from the world of etheric force, leaving him insome way depleted, or overstimulated, or in such a condition that Deathnaturally supervenes. It might be stated as a basic generalisation that personalphysical trouble has its seat at present in the emotional body, and that thatvehicle of expression is the one predominant predisposing agent in the illhealth of the individual, just as group ills and the sweep of epidemics of anykind through the masses are founded in some condition in the etheric substanceof the planet. Those diseases which are general, national, racial and planetaryfind their way to an individual via his etheric body, but are not so personal intheir implications. Upon this I will later enlarge. Today I but lay down thegeneral proposition.I would also like to point out that the diseases for the masses, for the averagecitizen, for the intelligentsia, and for the disciples of the world may, and do,differ widely—not so much in their expression as in their field of expression.[26] This is a point most difficult for the average healer to recognise; it isnot easy or possible for him to grasp these distinctions and to gauge the pointin evolution which a man may have reached. Some diseases must be dealt with fromthe mental plane, and will call in the mind of the healer; others require aconcentration of emotional energy by the healing agent; and again, in othercases, the healer should seek to be only a transmitter of pranic energy to theetheric body of the patient, via his own etheric body. How many healers arereally consciously aware of the focus of the consciousness or the life force inthe patient with whom they may be concerned? How many realise anything of thetype of healing which it is possible and necessary to apply to a disciple? Howfew realise that no disciple, for instance, can place himself in the hands ofthe average magnetic healer or radiatory worker, or psychological expert of anykind! A disciple dare not subject himself to the auric emanations of any chancehealer, nor put himself in the power of the inexperienced academic psychologist,no matter how prominent he may be. He may, however, subject himself to the wiseskill of the physical plane physician or surgeon, as—for him—the physical bodyis but an automaton. He can therefore avail himself of physical means for itsbenefiting. Much of the failure of the healing methods at present employedconsists in the inability of the healer to:1. Gauge the extent of the trouble, where it may be located basically, and inwhat body it principally arises and lies.2. Know where the patient stands upon the ladder of evolution, and where,therefore, he must look first for the source of the difficulty.3. Differentiate between the diseases which are due to inner personalconditions, or to inherited tendencies, or to group distribution. [27]4. To know whether the disease should be handled,a. Allopathically or homeopathically, for both can play their part at times, orthrough any of the other media of modern skill and science.b. Through radiation or magnetisation, or both.c. Through right inner psychological adjustment, aided by true insight on thepart of the healing agent.d. Through calling in the power of a man’s own soul—a thing that is not possibleexcept to advanced people.e. Through definite occult means, such as forming a healing triangle of—[Image00004.jpg]This method involves much knowledge and a high point of spiritual attainment onthe part of the healer;—it also presupposes the healer’s link with a Master andthe Master’s group, plus the earned right to call upon that group for energy onbehalf of the patient—a thing as yet rarely granted.I would like first of all to point out that my purpose and intent is not towrite a medical treatise. I shall not, therefore, deal with the anatomy of thebody, nor shall I discuss the symptoms of diseases, except quite incidentally. Ido not intend to elaborate symptoms or consider the many [28] diseases with longnames which distinguish the race at this time; all such information you cangather from the ordinary textbooks, if you so choose, and these you can study,if you care to do so. I find it personally not particularly satisfying. We willstart with the premise that there is disease; that disease is an effect of innercauses; that man has made as vast strides in the understanding of the effect ofthese causes as they produce changes in the outer garment of man, as science hasmade in the understanding of the outer garment of God, the world of phenomenalnature.The ameliorative and palliative and curative work of medicine and surgery areproved beyond all controversial discussion. The methods employed, such as thevivisection of animals, may rightly cause distress. In spite of all this theindebtedness of mankind to the medical profession is great, and the servicerendered to humanity by the profession does largely offset the evil. That theyknow not everything is true; that there is a small percentage of physicians andsurgeons (less than in any other profession) who are self-seeking and no creditto their craft is equally true; that they already know enough to be willing toadmit how very much more there is to be known is also correct. But that it is agreat and good and self-sacrificing group within the human family, is equallytrue. Forget this not.I deal with the subjective aspect of man, and with the secondary causes whichhave their roots in man’s inner bodies and in the subjective side of natureitself. The major primary causes, as I earlier explained, are impossible for youto grasp. They lie beyond the capacity of the concrete mind. I seek to makeclear what man may do to free himself increasingly from the accumulation of thepast, both individually and as a group, and in so doing to clear his physicalbody of the germs of disease. It must, however, be borne in mind that manydiseases are of a group [29] nature, and are consequently inherent in humanityitself. Just as the insect world devastates and destroys the vegetable kingdom,as any chance walker through the woods can note, so germs—individual andgroup—today devastate and destroy the human kingdom. They are agents ofdestruction and are performing a definite office and duty in the great scheme ofthings at present.The intent is for men to die, as every man has to die, at the demand of this ownsoul . When man has reached a higher stage in evolution, with deliberation anddefinite choice of time, he will consciously withdraw from his physical body. Itwill be left silent and empty of the soul; devoid of light, yet sound and whole:it will then disintegrate, under the natural process, and its constituent atomswill pass back into “the pool of waiting units,” until they are again requiredfor the use of incarnating souls. Again, on the subjective side of life, theprocess is repeated, but many have already learnt to withdraw from the astralbody without being subject to that “impact in the fog,” which is the symbolicway of describing the death of a man upon the astral plane. He then withdraws onto the mental level, and leaves his astral carcass to swell the fog and increaseits density.I seek to point out, therefore, that my avoidance of medical technicalities willbe deliberate, though we shall refer often to the physical body and to thediseases of which it is a prey.Secondly, I seek today to give you another of the Laws of Healing, as well asone of the Rules for the Healer. Study these with care.LAW IIDisease is the product of, and subject to, three influences. First, a man’spast, wherein he pays the price of [30] ancient error. Second, his inheritance,wherein he shares with all mankind those tainted streams of energy which are ofgroup origin. Thirdly, he shares with all the natural forms that which the Lordof Life imposes on His body. These three influences are called “The Ancient Lawof Evil Sharing.” This must give place some day to that new Law of AncientDominating Good which lies behind all that God made. This law must be broughtinto activity by the spiritual will of man.What is a law, my brother? It is the imposition (upon both the lesser and themore important) of the will and purpose of that which is superlatively great.Therefore, it lies beyond man’s ken. Man has some day to learn that all the lawsof nature have their higher, spiritual counterparts, and of these we shallshortly be in search. Our laws today are but secondary laws. They are the lawsof group life and they govern the kingdoms of nature and find their expression(for the human kingdom) through the medium of the mind, of the emotional nature,and through a physical plane agent. It is not my intention in this present shorttreatise to elucidate the primary laws. I but state them, and at a future time(dependent upon certain factors yet undeveloped) I may deal with them.In this treatise, the third part of it is stated to deal with the basic laws ofHealing. These deal not with the Laws referred to above, but with the practicalaspects of the healing art.The second rule for the healer is as follows:RULE TWOThe healer must achieve magnetic purity through purity of life. He must attainthat dispelling radiance which shows itself in every man when he has linked thecentres in the head. When this magnetic field is established, the radiation toogoes forth. [31]The significance of this will be somewhat apparent to the advanced esotericstudent. As you know, the magnetic field is established when the powerfulvibration of the centre in front of the pituitary body, and the centre aroundand above the pineal gland, swing into each other’s orbit. The onlycontroversial point in connection with the above rule (which we shall have laterto consider) is how and in what manner magnetic purity is to be achieved, andhow the two centres in the head can form together one magnetic field. Later, inour conclusion, which is intended to be intensely practical, I will touch uponthese two points.One of the things which should definitely emerge in our studies is the fact thatdisease is seldom of individual origin, unless a man misspends his life anddefinitely misuses his body (through drink or sexual dissipation), and that thebulk of the disease to be found in the world today is almost entirely of grouporigin, is inherited, is the result of infection, or the result ofundernourishment. The last named cause is primarily an evil of civilisation; itis the result of economic maladjustment or the corruption of food. As I earlierpointed out, these latter causes of disease are not primarily the result ofinner subtle forces, but are the pouring upwards, into the etheric body, ofenergies from the physical plane itself and from the outer world of forces.Little attention has been paid by occult teachers to these forces which comefrom without, which originate upon the physical plane, and which affect theinner bodies. There are physical energy and streams of force entering into theetheric bodies of all forms, just as the world illusion and the miasmas of theastral plane oft have their causes in physical plane conditions. The energiesentering into the centres of man from the subtler levels have oft beenconsidered in occult books, but the forces which find their way into the centresfrom the world of physical plane life [32] are seldom realised or discussed.This is a somewhat new thought which I offer for your consideration.I have asked A.A.B. to insert a very brief synopsis of some of the points I havealready made under the heading, What is Disease? I suggest the following:1. All disease is disharmony and lack of alignment and control.a. Disease is found in all the four kingdoms in nature.b. Disease is purificatory in effect.c. Definite methods of healing are peculiar to humanity, and mental in origin.2. Disease is a fact in nature.a. Antagonism to disease simply energises it.b. Disease is not the result of wrong human thought.3. Disease is a process of liberation and the enemy of that which is static.4. The law of cause and effect governs disease as it governs all else inmanifestation.We found also that healing is brought about in three ways:1. Through the application of the methods of the many schools of medicine andsurgery, and allied groups.2. Through the use of psychology.3. Through the activity of the soul.I have also stated that the major causes of disease are three in number: theyare psychological in nature; they are inherited through group contact; and theyare karmic. Remember, however, that these are the secondary causes and with thefirst of these we will now deal.1. CAUSES ARISING IN THE EMOTIONAL-DESIRE NATURE[33] In A Treatise on White Magic , I gave the world for the first timeinformation as to the nature and the control of the astral body. This book ispractically the first one ever given out to the public on this theme. Much hasbeen given in the past on the subject of the physical body and its care, both byexoteric and esoteric science. Much of it is true, and some of it is illusion.It is illusion because it is based on false premises. Modern esotericists havedealt with the subject of the etheric body, and this too has been partially trueand partially false, but it is more generally true from the occult point of viewthan it is exoterically. I may surprise you here if I tell you that A Treatiseon White Magic is also true as far as it goes, but it is necessarily limited,and because of these limitations it is also partially incorrect. Does the abovestatement astonish you? Remember, how can it be entirely true when we considerthe limitations of your power to comprehend? It is impossible for me to conveyto you the truth, because there exist neither the terminology nor an adequategroundwork of knowledge on your part. This makes my task difficult. Thisteaching on healing is likewise the hardest I have yet undertaken, and this fortwo reasons. First (the real nature of) the phrase “subtler bodies” is somewhatmeaningless, is it not? They are not bodies like the physical body. They can beregarded as centres or reservoirs of particular types of force, attached to eachindividual, and possessing their proper inlets and outlets. They are collectionsof atoms, vibrating at high speed and coloured (according to some schools ofoccultism) by certain definite hues; they emit a certain tone, and are atvarying points of evolution. According to others, they are states ofconsciousness and some regard them as made in the likeness of a man. What isyour definition, Brother of mine?[34] The astral body is, for the majority of mankind, the major determiningfactor to be considered. It is an outstanding cause of ill health. The reasonfor this is that it has a potent and predisposing effect upon the vital andetheric body. The physical body is an automaton of whichever inner body is thestrongest. When you remember that the vital body is the recipient of the streamsof energy, and is in fact composed and formed of such streams, and that thephysical body is driven into activity by these streams, it is apparent that thatstream which is the most potent is the one which will control the action of thephysical body upon the physical plane. There are, however, two streams of energywhich must be considered in studying the factors leading to physical planeactions. I would remind you in this connection that disease is an activity ofthe physical plane.1. The stream of life itself, anchored in the heart, which determines thevitality of the man, his capacity for work, and the term of his existence.2. The predominating stream of energy coming from the astral, mental or soulbodies. These control his expression upon the physical plane.With the masses of people throughout the world, and those whom we call the vastunthinking public, the dominating factors are the stream of life and the streamof astral or desire energy. This can be either of a low or medium calibre.With the thinking public, the dominating factors are these two streams, plus asteady inflowing and increasing tide of mental energy.With the intelligentsia of the world and the aspirant (those ready for, oralready on, the probationary path) [35] we find the above three streams reachinga point of equilibrium, and thus producing an integrating or coordinatingpersonality. These number amongst them also the mystics of the world and thecreative workers, who are conscious of the inspiration and the spiritual contactwhich indicates a beginning of the inflow of soul energy.With the disciples of the world, we find a group of men and women coming underthe control of soul energy, whilst the other three energies are beingincreasingly subordinated to this higher type of control.It should be borne in mind that there are two other types of energy with whichto reckon, when considering intelligent man.1. The energy which is composed of the fused and blended forces of a coordinatedpersonality.2. The energy of the physical plane itself, which is finally identified by theaspirant or disciple, and becomes so utterly negated that eventually itconstitutes one of the major factors in the release of the centres.Finally the time comes when the initiate works simply with three types of energywhilst expressing himself in incarnation: the energy of life itself, thenegative energy of the personality, and the positive energy of the soul. Thus heis an expression in conscious manifestation of the three aspects of the Trinity.Certain things should be established as occult facts in the consciousness of thehealer before he is able to work constructively.1. First of all, that there is nothing but energy and this energy manifestsitself as many differing and varying [36] energies. Of these many energies, theuniverse is composed. Likewise man’s bodies or vehicles of manifestation arewithout exception constituted of energy units. These we call atoms, and theseatomic units are held together in body form by the coherent force of more potentenergies.2. The major focal point of energy to be found in human beings is that of thesoul, but its potency as an agent of cohesion and of integration is as yetgreater than its quality potency. In the earlier stages of human evolution, itis the coherence aspect that demonstrates. Later as man’s response apparatus, orbodies, becomes more developed, the quality aspect of the soul begins todemonstrate increasingly.3. Seen from the inner side where time is not, the human creature demonstratesas an amazing kaleidoscopic mutable phenomenon. Bodies, so called, or ratheraggregates of atomic units, fade out and disappear, or flash again intomanifestation. Streams of colours pass and repass; they twine or intertwine.Certain areas will then suddenly intensify their brightness and blaze forth withbrilliance; or again they can be seen dying out and the phenomenon in certainareas will be colourless and apparently non-existent. But always there is apersistent over-shadowing light, from which a stream of lights pours down intothe phenomenal man; this can be seen attaching itself in two major localities tothe dense inner core of the physical man. These two points of attachment are tobe found in the head and in the heart. There can also be seen, dimly at firstbut with increasing brightness, seven other pale disks of light which are theearly evidence of the seven centres. [37][Image00005.jpg]4. These centres, which constitute the quality aspects and the consciousnessaspects, and whose function it is to colour the appearance or outer expressionof man and use it as a response apparatus, are (during the evolutionary process)subject to three types of unfoldment.a. That unfoldment which takes place as a physical plane child grows from aninfant to a man. By the time he is twenty-one, the centres should normally havereached the same quality of expression as they had attained when he passed outof life in a previous incarnation. The man then takes up life where he hadpreviously left it off.b. The awakening of the centres through life experience. Occasionally only onecentre may be dealt with in any one life; sometimes several are brought intogreater functioning consciousness.c. There is, finally, the awakening of these centres through the process ofinitiation. This of course only happens when the man is consciously upon thePath.5. The centres determine the man’s point of evolution as far as his phenomenalexpression is concerned ; they work directly upon the physical body through themedium [38] of the endocrine system. This point should be borne in mind, for thefuture occult healer will approach his patient with this knowledge. He will thenwork through those centres and glands which govern the particular area of thebody wherein the disease or discomfort is located. The time, however, for thishas not yet come, for man’s ignorance is great. Over-stimulation of the centres,and consequently of the glands, could easily be brought about, and the diseasedcondition might be stimulated also and increased, instead of dissipated orhealed.A. Uncontrolled and Ill-Regulated Emotion.Given these basic facts, it can be seen how wrong emotional attitudes and ageneral unhealthy condition of the astral body must be potent factors inproducing discomfort and disease. This is due to the fact that the vital oretheric bodies of the masses of humanity are governed primarily and swept intoactivity through the action of the astral body. Agitation in that body, anyviolent activity under stress of temper, intense worry or prolonged irritationwill pour a stream of astral energy into and through the solar plexus centre,and will galvanise that centre into a condition of intense disturbance. Thisnext affects the stomach, the pancreas, the gall duct and bladder. Few people(and I might well ask who is exempt at this particular time in the world’shistory) are free from indigestion, from undesirable gastric conditions, or fromtrouble connected with the gall bladder.The tendency to criticism, to violent dislikes, and to hatreds based oncriticism or a superiority complex, produces much of the acidity from which themajority of people suffer. I would like to add in passing that I am heregeneralising. So many people are prone to an inferiority complex [39] inrelation to themselves, but to a superiority complex where their relation toother people is concerned! Stomachic physical plane effects are closely tied upwith the desire aspect of the physical body, which finds expression in theeating and drinking of that which is desired, leading subsequently to thoseattacks of biliousness to which so many are prone.I offer these above illustrations to demonstrate the effect of the prevalentwrong attitudes to life and people which today distinguish mankind and producethe above mentioned conditions.The ills which are based on criticism, upon hatred, and upon the capacity tojudge each other (usually unkindly) work through from the throat centre to thesolar plexus. This inter-relation existing between the centres is one that hasnever been properly considered. The centres in the etheric body pass varyingkinds of energies amongst themselves, and a great deal of the energy transmittedfrom one centre to another is undesirable, flowing from the centres below thediaphragm to those above.The physical body (etheric and dense) can be pictured as a house with twotelephonic installations—one bringing in energies from without the house and theother being in the nature of a house telephone from room to room. The analogy isfar more accurate than appears to the casual thinker. In every modern house,light and water and gas and telephonic interchange are brought. Light, thesymbol of the soul; water, the symbol of the emotions; telephonic interchange,the symbol of mind with its intercommunication of knowledges; and gas, thesymbol of the etheric nature.It is interesting and saddening to note that that which at present goes out ofthe average house is the refuse that is undesirable—this is the correspondenceto that which is [40] selfish and sad and the demand for the satisfaction ofpersonal needs and desires.It can be seen, therefore, why I have so emphatically impressed the need ofharmlessness upon all of you, for it is the scientific method, par excellenceand esoterically speaking, of cleaning house and of purifying the centres. Itspractice clears the clogged channels and permits the entrance of the higherenergies.The emotional causes of disease and the mental attitudes which produce physicaldiscomfort are at this particular time those which are the most prevalent. Whenthey are persisted in over a long period of time, and are carried over from lifeto life, they cause the more violent aspects of the conditions referred toabove, and from them serious and destructive diseases can emerge, necessitating,for instance, the removal of the gall bladder or those operations incident tothe appearance of chronic gastric ulcers. Other diseases grow from a constantpandering to the desire nature, though sexual diseases come under anothercategory. It can be seen from the above how desirable it is that the true healershould combine in himself, not only a measure of esoteric knowledge, but—untilhe is an initiate—something of psychology, something of the work of a magnetichealer, and also be a trained medical man or surgeon.Much of the healing now done is worse than useless, because the three abovementioned conditions are lacking. Most doctors, especially those who are calledgeneral practitioners, are good psychologists and they have also a soundknowledge of symptoms and of anatomy and of curative measures which are usuallylacking in the average metaphysical healer. But they are entirely ignorant ofone great field of knowledge—that concerning the energies which meet and warwithin the human frame and of the [41] potencies which can be set in motion ifcertain esoteric truths are admitted in place. Until they work with the ethericbody and study the science of the centres, they can make little furtherprogress. The esoteric healer knows much about the inner forces and energies andhas some understanding of the basic causes of the exoteric diseases, but hisignorance of man’s mechanism is deplorable, and he fails to realise two things:First, that disease is sometimes the working out into manifestation ofundesirable subjective conditions. These, when externalised and brought to thesurface of the human body, can then be known, dealt with and eliminated. It iswell to remember also that sometimes this working out and elimination may wellbring about the death of that particular body. But the soul goes on. One shortlife counts for very little in the long cycle of the soul, and it is countedwell worthwhile if a period of ill health (even if it eventuates in death)brings about the clearing away of wrong emotional and mental conditions.Second, disease is sometimes incident upon and part of the process of thewithdrawal of the soul from its habitation. This we call death, and it can comequickly and unexpectedly when the soul withdraws with suddenness from its body.Or death can spread itself over a long period of time, and the soul may takeseveral months or years for its slow and gradual emergence from the body, withthe body dying by inches all the time.There is not sufficient knowledge yet among healers to enable them to deal withwisdom in these matters. We might therefore conclude that: [42]1. Disease is a purificatory process, carried out in order to produce a purerexpression, life aroma, influence and soul usefulness. When this is the case, acure is possible.2. Disease can be a gradual and slow process of dying and of thus releasing thesoul. A cure then will not be possible, though palliative and ameliorativemeasures are needed and should most certainly be used. The length of the lifecan be prolonged, but a permanent and final cure is out of the question. Thisthe average mental healer fails to realise. They make a horror out of death,whereas death is a beneficent friend.3. Disease can be the sudden and final call to the body to relinquish the souland set it free for other service.In all these cases everything possible should be done from the standpoint ofmodern medical and surgical science and the allied sciences of which there aretoday so many. Much too can be done from the angle of mental and spiritualhealing, aided by the science of psychology. Some day there must comecooperation in these various fields and a synthesising of their efforts.I have earlier pointed out that the astral body is the prime motivating factorin the lives of the majority. This is caused by the fact that:1. It is the body in which the bulk of human beings are today centering theirconsciousness.2. It is the most developed of the bodies at this time, and therefore receivesthe bulk of the life energy as it comes down the life stream, from the soul, andlikewise receives the energy of the stream of consciousness. [43]3. It is oriented, if I may so express it, outwards or towards the plane ofphysical experience. That orientation shifts at times and, temporarily in thecase of the aspirant, turns inwards. Just as the centres in man, the “lotuses oflife,” are depicted as turned downwards and with the stalk upwards in theundeveloped man, but are turned upwards in the case of the developed, so thereare conditions in the astral body analogous to this. In the case of the highlyevolved man, of the initiate or the Master, the astral body is steadily orientedtowards the soul. In the mystic, the aspirant and the disciple, the process ofthus definitely changing the direction of the forces is going on and producing,therefore, a temporary chaos.4. The astral body of man, being the latest to develop (the physical and theetheric being the first two in order of time) is still the most alive andpotent. It reached its acme of development in late Atlantean days and itspotency is still great, constituting the mass potency, the mass emphasis, andthe mass polarisation. This is also augmented by energies coming from the animalkingdom, which is entirely astral in its point of attainment.I would remind you here that the use of the word “body” is most misleading andunfortunate. It produces in the consciousness the idea of a defined form and aspecific shape. The astral body is an aggregate of forces, working through intothe consciousness in the form of desires, impulses, longings, wishes,determinations, incentives, and projections, thus laying the basis for much ofthe truth of the teachings of modern psychology. Psychologists have discovered(or rather uncovered) the nature of some of these forces, and their terminologyin this connection is frequently more truly occult and accurate than is that of[44] the orthodox esotericist and theosophist.It may be of interest to you if I do two things. First of all, give you sometechnical information in connection with the working through of the forces fromthe astral plane into the physical body, and then give you the effects of thatworking through, as they take the form—owing to man’s wrong use of them—ofdisease and the many varying disorders to which man is prone. With their cure weare not at this time concerned. I am here simply laying down the structure offact upon which we can later base our conclusions. We shall, in this connection,only consider the average man. The problems of the disciple will be dealt withunder Part I.4.I pointed out earlier that the three major groups of diseases for the massesare—1. Tuberculosis.2. The social diseases, as they are called: the venereal diseases and syphilis.3. Cancer.To these we must add two other groups of disease which predominantly affectthose who are a little above the average and whose general level of intelligenceis higher than that of the mass; this includes also the aspirants of the world.4. Heart diseases, but not what is called heart failure.5. The nervous diseases so prevalent at this time.These five groups of disease, and their various sub-divisions are responsiblefor the bulk of the physical ills which attack humanity. A right grasp of theirpreponderating causes will be of definite assistance to future medicine. Howmuch will be accepted is at this time doubtful.I would like to point out here that, as you well know, there are physicalcorrespondences to the seven centres of [45] forces located in the etheric body,and fed from the astral body. These we call the endocrine glands. These glandsare effects of or testifying evidence to, the centres, and are in their turninitiating causes of lesser effects in the physical body. It will be of value ifwe here tabulate some of the things we know, and aid comprehension.Centre Gland Physical Organs Type of Force Origin Body 1. Head Brahmarandra.1000-petalled lotus.

The Mother of the World.[46] This tabulation is simply an outline and, like the tabulation of theprinciples and their correspondences, as given by H.P.B. in the third volume ofThe Secret Doctrine, its interpretation will be dependent upon the point of viewof the student. We shall employ it later and add further columns to it andfurther correspondences. In all our considerations, what we have to say willhave the following synthesis of structure behind it:1. The soul.2. The subtler bodies of the mind and the emotions, which are simply qualifiedenergy centres.3. The vital body with its seven major centres of force.4. The endocrine system, which is an effect of the seven centres, and thedetermining controlling factor in the physical body of man.5. The nervous system in its three divisions.6. The blood stream.All the subsidiary organs of man are effects; they are not pre-determiningcauses. The determining causes in man, and that which makes him what he is, arethe glands. They are externalisations of the types of force pouring through theetheric centres from the subtler worlds of being. They express the point inevolution which the man has reached; they are vital and active or non-vital andinactive, according to the condition of the centres. They demonstrate asufficiency, an oversufficiency or a deficiency, according to the condition ofthe etheric vortices.Again, the process of control may be stated to be via the nervous system; theclose interlocking directorate of the nervous system, the brain and the bloodstream (as a carrier of the life principle) governs the activities of theman—conscious, sub-conscious, self-conscious, and finally, [47] super-conscious.The three centres in supreme control today for the majority are:1. The ajna centre, the centre between the eyebrows.2. The solar plexus.3. The sacral centre.Eventually, when man will have “become that which he is” (that paradoxicalesoteric phrase), the centres of control will be:1. The head centre, the brahmarandra.2. The heart centre.3. The centre at the base of the spine.Between the present and the future, the emphasis will be laid upon a constantlyshifting triplicity, and each man will be different from his fellowmen as toemphasis, as to the conditions of his centres, as to their glandularcorrespondences in the physical body, and therefore as to the diseases and theills, inhibitions, and difficulties to which his flesh will fall heir. It is inthis connection that it becomes obvious that the work of the physician and ofthe psychologist must eventually go hand in hand. The three most importantaspects of all diagnoses are:1. The psychological , or the gauging of the inner bodies of man from the angleof their development, their integration and the total coordination of thepersonality, as these subtler aspects of the human being express themselves inconsciousness.2. The work of the endocrinologist, as he deals with the endocrine glands,viewing them as power stations through which energy—dynamic and illuminating—canpour through from the centres.3. The physician, who, taking into consideration the conclusions of the twoabove experts, diagnoses the [48] disease, and treats it in collaboration withthe other two.These three may call in other experts and specialists in electro-therapy,osteopathy and chiropractic, but it is in the combination of the knowledge ofthe physician, the psychologist and the endocrinologist that the medicalprofession can take on a new expression of usefulness, and enter the new ageequipped to deal with the people who will gradually assume the new types and achanging physical organism. Electricity, in relation to human ills, is as yet aninfant science, but it has in it the germs of the new techniques and methods ofhealing. The work done by the chiropractors is good and needed but should, withosteopathy, constitute a definite subsidiary technique to that of the otherthree. The work of the chiropractors and of the osteopaths forms two halves ofone whole, little as their practitioners may like to recognise it. The formergroup need a more careful and lengthy training, and a higher standard oftechnical knowledge should be required.Medicine is entering slowly into a new usefulness. Once the cause of disease isshifted out of an organ or bodily system into a more subtle and vital realm, weshall see radical and needed changes, leading to simplification and not to agreater complexity and difficulty.From the above remarks it will be seen that disease emerges into the physicalbody from the world of the unseen, and from the use, or misuse, of the subtlerforces on the inner planes. It must be remembered, however, that disease—as itexpresses itself in man—can be generally regarded as due to the followingcauses, and students would do well to have this most carefully in mind as theyponder on these matters:1. Individual disease, due to interior conditions in a man’s own equipment, tohis mental state, or to an emotional [49] condition which can produce seriousills. This is inherited from the past.2. Disease inherent in humanity as a whole. There are certain diseases to whichall men are prone; the germs of these diseases are latent in the physicalvehicles of the majority of men, only awaiting predisposing conditions in orderto manifest. They might be regarded as group diseases.3. Diseases which are, curiously enough, accidental. To these a man falls heirwhen, for instance, he succumbs to some infectious or contagious complaint.4. Diseases inherent in the soil. Of these as yet but little is known. The soilof our earth, however, is very ancient, and is impregnated with disease germswhich take their toll of the vegetable, animal and human kingdoms, manifestingdifferently in each, yet being due basically to the same causes.5. Diseases which are the difficulties of mysticism. These are the peculiar illsand complaints which attack the disciples and aspirants of the world. These canbe traced in every case to the pouring in of energy through centres which arenot properly equipped, or adequately developed, to handle the force.The above is a generalisation which may be found useful.The method whereby these astral forces (which are, as we know, preeminently thedetermining life forces for the majority of men at this time) work out intomanifestation is a relatively simple matter. In the astral vehicle of expressionthere are, as you may realise, the correspondences of the seven centres in theetheric body. These are essentially the seven major focal points of force, andeach of them is expressive of one of the seven ray energies. Let me first of allmake clear which centres express these seven ray types:[50]Centre Ray Quality Origin 1. Head Centre 1st The Divine Will. Monadic 2. AjnaCentre 7th Organisation. Direction. Atmic 3. Heart Centre 2nd Love-Wisdom. Grouplove. Buddhic 4. Throat Centre 5th Creativity. Mental 5. Solar Plexus 6thEmotion. Desire. Astral 6. Sacral Centre 3rd Reproduction. Etheric. 7. Base ofSpine 4th Harmony. Union through conflict. PhysicalNote: In the fourth kingdom, the human, it is the energy of the fourth raywhich, cooperating with the first ray, eventually brings synthesis. There is aclose relation between the highest centre (the head centre), and that at thebase of the spine. This fourth type of energy thus expresses itself incooperation with the first type because we are still Atlantean in ourpolarisation, and that civilisation was the fourth in order. It is very largelythe work done in our fifth civilisation, our present Aryan race, which will, incooperation with the fifth principle of the mind, bring a shift into a higherlevel of consciousness. This will produce a harmonising of all the centresthrough an act of the will, intellectually and intelligently applied, with theobjective of producing harmony. This point warrants thought.On the astral plane there will also be found in every astral body sevencorresponding focal points through which energy can enter, raying forth theninto the vital centres in the etheric physical body as seven differentiatedtypes of force. These types of force produce both bad and good effects,according to the quality of the negative dense physical body. These differaccording to the type of ray or force, and it may be interesting if I hereindicate to you the good and the bad effects and the corresponding diseases.[51]Astral Force Centre Bad Aspect Disease Good Aspect First ray.

It is only intended to be suggestive; the complexity ofthe human equipment and the intricacy of the ray energies are such that no hardand fast rules can be laid down. The ray forces manifest differently, accordingto ray type and point in evolution. There is therefore no contradiction here tothe previous tabulations. If you bear in mind that every human being isbasically an expression of five ray forces:1. The ray of the soul,2. The ray of the personality,3. The ray governing the mental body,4. The ray governing the astral equipment,5. The ray of the physical nature,it will become apparent that for the average person two such tabulations wouldhave to be drawn up.1. There would be required the positive analysis of the astral forces as theyexpress the personality.2. An analysis of the soul forces as they are faintly indicated. A negativeanalysis concerning what is not present in the equipment can be of little valuehere.It will again be necessary to have an analysis of the forces, playing throughinto the physical body from the astral plane, which are received directly fromthe soul and are therefore a combination of soul-force plus the highest type ofastral energy. This would be in the nature of a synthetic analysis and wouldonly be possible in the case of a disciple or an initiate. You will thereforeeventually have for each person: [53]1. A positive analysis of the personality forces, primarily of the astral forceas that is the predominating force pouring into the etheric centres.2. A negative analysis of those aspects of soul energy which are not present.3. A synthetic analysis, based on both the above. but combining also the recordof positive soul expression.In these tabulations and statements I have given you much food for thought.B. Desire, Inhibited or Rampant.It would be of value to you here if I made clear that one of the first things astudent has to remember is that—for the majority of human beings, for the hugemajority—the influences and impulses which emanate from the astral plane are apredisposing factor in all matters with which the individual concerns himself,apart from those conditions which (being imposed upon him from his environmentand the period in which he lives) are, for him, unavoidable. The astral plane isa centre of dynamic emanating force, which is fundamentally conditioning in itseffect because of the stage of the individual consciousness at which thatmajority finds itself. Men are swayed by the impulse of desire of a high or lowcalibre. This is, of course, a broad generalisation, for that basic condition isbecoming steadily modified by impulses coming from the mental plane. Thisnecessarily complicates the problem. Influences emanating from the soul are alsobecoming appreciably present, and still further complicate the problem of theadvanced human being. This “problem of complication” (if I might so call it)constitutes a “hard saying” for the student to understand in relation to his ownphysical condition or to that of any one whom he may be seeking to help.[54] I should like here, in this connection, to give you the third of the Lawswhich govern the sacred art of healing.LAW IIIDiseases are an effect of the basic centralisation of a man’s life energy. Fromthe plane whereon those energies are focussed, proceed those determiningconditions which produce ill health, and which, therefore, work out as diseaseor as freedom from disease.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that a shift of the inner attention (themental attitude) of the patient can and will produce either real freedom fromphysical ills or an intensification of those reactions which produce discomfort,disease or death.In the three laws which I have given you and which you now have before you forconsideration, it is obvious that the following facts emerge. These should formthe basis of your reflection:1. Disease is the result of the blocking of the free flow of the life of theSOUL.2. It is the product, or the result, of three influences:a. Ancient error, emanating from the past history of the person involved.b. Human taints, inherited because one is a member of the human family.c. Planetary evil, imposed upon all forms on earth by the basic condition, andby time.3. It is conditioned by the forces emanating from that plane whereon a man’sconsciousness is primarily centred.To the above statements should be added a further fact, already mentioned, that:[55]4. There are five major groups of diseases, with their allied complaints andsubsidiary diseases.a. Tuberculosis.b. The syphilitic diseases.c. Cancer.d. Heart difficulties.e. Nervous diseases.I am not dividing what I have to say into organic and functional troubles, nordo I here refer to illnesses induced by epidemics or by accidents. I refer tothose basic taints or predispositions that are the dubious heritage of humanityas a whole, and to those difficulties which are incident to those stages inevolutionary development which are characteristic of those upon the moreadvanced stages of the Path. It will be seen, therefore, that man comes intoincarnation having inherited predispositions to disease which come:1. From his own past; i.e., effects which are the result of causes initiated inearlier incarnations.2. From the general racial heritage of humanity.3. From the condition of the planetary life. These latter causes lift the wholeproblem out of the usual comprehension of the average man.A human being is also predisposed to trouble if he has succeeded (as a result ofa long evolutionary history) in awakening in some fashion, however slight, thecentres above the diaphragm. The moment that that occurs he becomes subject, fora long cycle of lives, to difficulties connected with the heart or with thenervous system in its various branches. Frequently an advanced human being, suchas an aspirant or a disciple, may have freed himself from the inherited taints,but will succumb to heart trouble, to nervous disorders, mental imbalance, andoverstimulation. They are [56] classified occasionally as the “diseases of theMystics.”I would like to make it clear that it is not my intention to enter into therealm of physiological discussion, to elaborate the symptoms of disease, or todeal with the lesions, the pathological conditions, and the distressing detailsattendant upon the breakdown of any human organism. I am not going to write atreatise on anatomy or on the various sciences which have grown up from a studyof the mechanism of the human being, connected as they are with the frameworkand structure, the organs, nerves, brain tissue and interrelated systems whichcompose that intricate piece of machinery, the human body. As far as theexoteric science is concerned, two things would successfully deter me:1. The whole subject is marvellously dealt with in the many books which embodythe literature of medicine and of surgery. There is little that I could addwhich would be of profit in such a discussion as this.2. The readers of my words are not, with few exceptions, versed in theconstruction and constitution of the human body; and pathological details, thedescription of diseases, and the various unpleasant symptoms of humandegeneration are unwholesome reading for the average man or woman. A littleknowledge along these lines can be a most dangerous thing.I seek to deal primarily with causes , with the inner sources of dis-ease anddeal with those states of consciousness (I do not say states of mind only) whichinduce wrong functioning, and eventually wrong conditions.The problem of the healer, therefore, is twofold: First, he must know whetherthe difficulty lies above or below the diaphragm; this takes him definitely intothe realm of occult as well as of psychological knowledge. Secondly, he must[57] have a clear grasp of the patient’s inner emphasis; this last aids him inthe diagnosis of the first.This statement brings me to the formulation of the third Rule for Healers.RULE THREELet the healer train himself to know the inner stage of thought or of desire ofthe one who seeks his help. He can thereby know the source from which thetrouble comes. Let him relate the cause and the effect, and know the point exactthrough which relief must come.I would like to call your attention to those last few words, and would emphasiseto you the fact that disease primarily is an effort on the part of the naturalphysical body to seek relief and achieve release from inner pressures, fromsubjective inhibitions and hidden retentions. Primarily, from the point of viewof esotericism, all physical disease is the result of:1. Wrong stimulation, or overstimulation, or wrongfully placed stimulation andof inner tensions in some part of the mechanism.2. Inhibitions, psychical starvation, and those accumulated subjective forceswhich dam the flow of the life forces.You will see, therefore, that again (in the domain of health) all problemsresolve themselves into the right use and the correct handling of force, inorder to effect the free flow of energy.The following questions will inevitably arise: From whence come these inheritedtaints? Is it possible to arrive at their source? The problem of the past, andthe present effects of that past, is too vast for consideration, nor can anystatements anent the situation possibly help humanity. [58] One generalisation Ican, however, make, and even that may convey but little to your understanding.Of the three major diseases which have been inherited from the past, it might besaid that the syphilitic or so-called social diseases are remainders of theexcesses indulged in in Lemurian times; they are of such ancient origin that thevery soil is permeated with the germs of these diseases—a fact quite unknown tomodern science. Down the ages, men have suffered from these groups ofinfections; they have died and been buried and in their millions havecontributed their quota of infection to the earth. In Lemurian times, theemphasis of the life force was upon the physical body, upon its development, itsuse and control, and also upon its perpetuation or reproduction. It was inLemurian times that troubles connected with the misuse of the sex life began;this was, in a peculiar sense, the essential primeval evil, and concerning thisfact, ancient legends and hints are found throughout the earliest records andwritings. There is much misinterpreted testimony to this effect, and when mencan read the records more correctly and with right interpretation, they willunderstand the way out, because they will see more clearly the underlyingcauses.Cancer is a gift to modern man from the Atlantean humanity, and the scourge ofthis disease was the major factor which devastated the inhabitants of oldAtlantis. The roots of this dire evil are deep-seated in the emotional or desirenature, and are grounded in the astral body. Cancer is partially the result of areaction to the diseases connected with the sex life which became so rampant inlater Lemurian times and early Atlantean days. The people of those times, seeingthe fearful evils and the extent of the disease which grew up out of the fertileLemurian life, resulting from the promiscuous sex life on every hand, for thesake of self-preservation dammed back the natural flow of desire (the [59] flowof life as it expresses itself through the centres of reproduction andprocreation), and this in due time produced other evils. Cancer is primarily adisease of inhibition, just as the syphilitic diseases are those ofover-expression and overuse of one aspect of the mechanism of man.Today, owing to the vast reaches of time involved and to the untold generationsof those who have died upon the earth, the “germs” (so-called by the unlearnedthinker) of the dread complaint of cancer are to be found in the very soil onwhich we live, infecting the vegetable kingdom and also the human family. Acorrespondence to the syphilitic complaints of man are to be found in themineral kingdom.Tuberculosis, which was devastatingly rampant at a certain stage in Atlanteantimes, is nevertheless a disease which has been generated principally in ourAryan race, and one which we are bequeathing to the animal kingdom and aresharing with them. This is beginning to be realised. So close, however, is therelation between men and animals (particularly the domestic animals) that theytoday share with men practically all his ailments in some form or another,sometimes recognisable and sometimes not. Curiously enough, the cause of thisgreat white scourge is to be found in the fact of the shift of the life emphasisaway from the emotional nature into that of the mind nature, producing atemporary starvation of the emotional nature. It is largely a disease ofdepletion. Cancer, in its turn, was based similarly on a previous shift of thelife force from the physical body into that of the emotional nature, producingan overdevelopment of the cellular life, through overstimulation. I realise thedifficulty of grasping these statements. I can only give you theseunsubstantiated hints. Later discoveries alone can prove the truth of mysuggestions. Let us here tabulate our conclusions: [60]Disease Race Body Kingdom Organ Syphilitic Lemurian Physical Mineral Sex organs.Sacral centre. Cancer Atlantean Astral Vegetable Solar plexus Tuberculosis AryanMental Animal Breathing apparatus. Throat centre.In referring above to the centres I am referring to the centre for thedistribution of the life force, wherein the emphasis for the mass will be found.From the above it will be apparent where the emphasis of the possible cure willhave to lie. Already, and because it is the latest, and therefore the leastdeep-seated of the three major diseases inherited by modern man, we have learnthow to cure tuberculosis. It has been discovered (when the mind wasintelligently applied to the problem) that sunshine and good food could cure, orat any rate arrest, the disease. It is an interesting item in the field ofesoteric correspondence that just as the light of the soul, pouring into themind, can be depended upon to solve any problem, so that light of the sun andits prophylactic rays can dispel the dread symptoms of tuberculosis.Similarly, as the race develops right emotional control we shall see the gradualdisappearance of the phenomena of cancer. I said right emotional control;inhibition and the suppression of the desire impulses by the force of the willis not right control. It is interesting also to note that though both men andwomen suffer from the disease of cancer, the general cause is not identical,though the basic cause (reaction from an over-expression of the sex life throughthe cultivation of the desire nature) remains the same. Women, owing to therisks they run in childbearing, through the turning of the life emphasis to thesex aspect of life, have revolted on a large scale (as did the Atlanteans)against this form of life expression, and it is along this line—the sex [61]line—that their major inhibitions are found. They do not suffer so much from thegeneral inhibition of the emotional-desire-feeling expression. Men do sufferfrom this latter inhibition and have a tradition or a marked tendency to greateremotional control in the handling of life than have women. Men do not require oracquire so marked a sex control. The general field of their inhibited lifetendency is therefore of greater extent, and consequently (if statistics can betrusted) more men suffer from cancer than do women, though it is a dreaddisease, feared by all.In the secret of right transmutation lies the cure of cancer, and this willeventually be realised. I am using this phrase not only symbolically but alsotechnically and scientifically. This again will later be seen. In the secret ofright rhythmic living and in a right proportional accent upon all phases of lifewill come (and it is rapidly coming) complete immunity from tuberculosis. In thesecret of right understanding of times and cycles and of periodic reproductivecreation, will come the emergence of the race from the evils of the socialdiseases.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that the syphilitic diseases will be thelast to disappear, just as they were the first to devastate the race.Tuberculosis is disappearing. The attention of the experts is now being given tothe cure of cancer.I would like to add one or two comments which will be of general or rathermodern interest. I have said that these taints to which humanity is prone arefound in the soil, and that their presence there is largely due to the burial,down the ages, of millions of corpses. By the increased use of the processes ofcremation, this condition will be steadily improved. Gradually, very gradually,the taint will thus die out. It is therefore highly desirable that there be asmuch propaganda as possible for the use of this method of [62] disposing of thediscarded physical vehicles of the souls who are passing out of incarnation. Asthe soil becomes less tainted, and as soul contact is established, we can hopeto see a steady decrease in the number of those who succumb to the inheritedtaints. Curiously enough, the free use of salt sea bathing has a definite effecton the healthiness of the physical body. The water, incidentally absorbedthrough the medium of the skin and by the mouth, has a vitally prophylacticeffect.One of the major problems today to the psychologist and in a lesser degree tothe medical man, is the growth of homosexuality, both female and male. Speciousarguments are brought forth in order to prove that this abnormal development(and the consequent interest in this morbid tendency) is due to the fact thatthe race is slowly becoming androgynous in its development, and that the futurehermaphroditic man or woman is gradually making its appearance. This, again, isnot true. Homosexuality is what you call a “left-over” from the sexual excessesof Lemurian times, an inherited taint, if you like. Egos who individualised andincarnated in that vast period of time are the ones who today demonstratehomosexual tendencies. In those days, so urgent was the sexual appetite, thenormal processes of human intercourse did not satisfy the insatiable desire ofthe advanced man of the period. Soul force, flowing in through the processes ofindividualisation, served to stimulate the lowest centres. Hence, forbiddenmethods were practised. Those who thus practised them are today, in greatnumbers, in incarnation, and the ancient habits are too strong for them. Theyare now far enough advanced upon the evolutionary path so that the cure liesready at this time—if they choose to employ it. They can, with relative ease,transfer the sex impulse to the throat centre, and thus become creative in thehigher sense, employing the energy [63] sensed and circulating in right andconstructive ways. Many of them are beginning automatically to do this. However,it is well known that, among the so-called artistic types, homosexuality is veryprevalent. I say “so-called” for the truly creative artist is not the victim ofthese ancient evil predisposing habits.It might be pointed out here that homosexuality is of three kinds:1. That which is the result of ancient evil habits. This is the major causetoday and indicates:a. Individualisation upon this planet; for those who individualised upon themoon chain are not susceptible to these dangerous characteristics.b. A relatively advanced stage upon the evolutionary path which was achieved bythe Lemurian egos who succumbed to this desire-satisfaction.c. A consequent study of sex magic, plus a constant insatiable physical andsexual urge.2. Imitative homosexuality. A number of persons of all classes imitated theirbetters (if I might use so paradoxical a term) and so developed evil habits insexual intercourse from which they might otherwise have remained free. This isone of the prevalent reasons today, among many men and women, and is based upona too active imagination, plus a powerful physical or sex nature, and a prurientcuriosity. This I say with advisement. This category accounts for many of ourSodomites and Lesbians.3. A few rare, very rare, cases of hermaphroditism. These people, combining inthemselves both aspects of the sex life, are faced with a very real problem. Itis a problem which is greatly increased by human ignorance, human refusal toface facts, wrong early training and teaching, [64] and a widespreadmisunderstanding. These cases are to be found in small numbers everywhere, eventhough their numbers, in relation to the world population, is still negligible.But that they exist is of real interest to the medical profession and a subjectof deep pity and commiseration to the humanitarian and the understandingpsychologist. They face a difficult situation.I have somewhat elaborated this matter as it is of use for you to know suchfacts and the information is of value to you. It serves to throw light upon aproblem which an increasingly large number of people are called upon to face.Psychologists, social workers, physicians, and all those occupied with grouptraining constantly meet with this problem, and it is just as well that somedistinction is made between the types which must be considered, thus clarifyingthe issue. (The Problem of Sex. Pages 268-307. Esoteric Psychology Vol I)You will find in these instructions many hints which, though they may not beclassified definitely as instructions in healing, yet fall into that category,for they will make those of you who read more efficient in understanding.You will note also from the above how this taint, as might well be expected, hasits roots in the astral or sentient body, the body of sensation. It is for thisreason that I have included it. It would be an interesting experiment inanalysis if these various well-known difficulties, diseases and complaints couldbe classified under their originating impulses. So few of them have a mentalorigin, in spite of all that Christian Science or Mental Science may say to thecontrary. Perhaps I should say, rather, that they are not based on wrong humanthought, though all evil can be aggravated and intensified by wrong thought.Many or perhaps most of the [65] complaints from which average man suffers arebased upon astral causes or upon some clearly defined desire. A formulateddesire is one that finds expression in some form of activity. Of thesehomosexuality is one of the clearest to define. The other diseases to whichhumanity is heir are sometimes not so easy to clarify and define. The man orwoman is a victim but the cause producing the illness or difficulty—physical orpsychological—lies hid in a long past which the victim (with his limitedknowledge) is unable to investigate, nor can he arrive at the cause producingthe effect. All that he can affirm is that, in all probability, desire was theinitiating impulse. What human beings are today and what they suffer is theresult of their long past, and the past presupposes long and well-establishedhabits. Such habits are inevitably the result of one of two factors:1. Desire, dominating and controlling action,or2. Mental control which substitutes for desire a planned campaign which will runcounter in many cases to the normally sensed, defined desire.You will note from the above that it is my wish that you grasp the importance ofthe emotional sentient body and its power to initiate those secondary causeswhich, in this life, demonstrate as disease.You will note consequently the emphasis I have laid upon the astral body as apromoter of wrong physical conditions, and the necessity for astralunderstanding and control on the part of the patient, if there is to be a trueovercoming of disease. Will you understand me if I say that the true overcomingmay mean an acceptance of the Way of Death as the way out, should it comenormally, or of healing, if the causes [66] which are the initial impulses areexhausted? Ponder on this.In all the above, even in connection with what I have said concerninghomosexuality, I have considered either rampant or inhibited desire, but I haveonly considered it in general terms and in a broad outline. Will youmisunderstand if I point out to you that where desire is inhibited (which is thecase with many aspirants today) all kinds of diseases—cancer, congestion of thelungs and certain liver complaints—become possible, as well as the dread maladyof tuberculosis? The diseases of inhibition are numerous and serious, as youwill note from the above enumeration. It should be noted that where desire isrampant and uncontrolled and no inhibition is present, such diseases as thesyphilitic disorders, homosexuality and inflammations and fevers appear.According to the temperament so will be the types of disease, and thetemperament is dependent upon the ray quality. People on the different rays arepredisposed to certain disorders. The psychologists are right in their basicdifferentiation of human beings into the two major types—extroverts andintroverts. These two types produce their own qualities of disease, whichdemonstrate as ill health through over-expression or inhibition.We have considered our second point under the healing of diseases which arise inthe emotional or desire nature. Our first point deals with uncontrolled emotion.I would remind you of our premise that we would only consider the ills to whichadvanced humanity, the aspirants and disciples of all degrees are prone. We willnot deal (in this short treatise) with the whole gamut of diseases which affecthumanity as a whole, or down the ages. The more advanced the aspirant, thegreater probability there is that the diseases from which he suffers will bepronounced and powerfully demonstrating, on account of the inflow to a greater[67] or less degree of the stimulating force of the soul. Subsidiary to the fivemajor groups of diseases to which I earlier referred, and working out inconnection with them in the human frame, are a group of symptoms which areloosely covered by the terms: fevers, tumors, congested areas, plus generaldebility and the auto-intoxication which lies behind so many symptoms. I wouldhave you remember this with care and bear steadily in mind that I am here onlygeneralising, but that this generalisation is basic and therefore of importance.C. Diseases of Worry and Irritation.The third category of complaints which arise in the emotional or astral body issynthesised esoterically under the term: diseases of irritation. These are theinsidious poisons which lurk behind the phenomena of disease.It might be said that all diseases can be covered by two definitions, from thestandpoint of occultism:1. Diseases which are the result of auto-intoxication. These are the mostgeneral.2. Diseases which are the result of irritation. These are very common amongstdisciples.We hear much today about auto-intoxication, and many efforts are made to curethis by diet and the regulation of the life in terms of rhythmic living. Allthis is good and of help, but it does not constitute a basic cure, as itsprotagonists would lead us to believe. Irritation is a basic psychologicalcomplaint and has its roots in the intensification of the astral body, whichdefinitely produces abnormal effects upon the nervous system. It is a disease ofself-interest, of self-sufficiency, and of self-satisfaction. Again I would say,ponder on these terms, for these three aspects of irritation are of generaldiscovery. We will therefore [68 ] deal with irritation, “imperil,” as it iscalled by exponents of the first ray, such as the Master M.We have nearly completed our first section under the heading PsychologicalCauses of Disease, and have very briefly, yet I believe suggestively, consideredthose problems which arise from the overactivity and wrong condition of theastral body. All I can do in this short treatise is to generalise, because mostof the statements I may make are, in any case, so new and revolutionary (fromthe standpoint of orthodox medicine) that it will take time for even this firstinner structure of ideas and this somewhat new formulation of truth to make itsimpact upon the thinkers of the race. Then, if accepted as hypotheticalpossibilities by the open-minded among them, a long period of time must elapsebefore there has been enough investigation, leading to definitely formulatedconclusions, which will make the ideas of popular recognition and use. In sayingthis, I am not reflecting critically upon the medical profession. Themoney-grasping specialist and the charlatan are rare; they of course exist, asdo the corrupt and the undesirable in every profession. Where are they not to befound? The closed minds are many; but again, where are they not found? Thepioneers along the new lines of thought and the man who has grasped some of theNew Age concepts have often equally closed minds and see nothing but the newways, modes and methods, and throw overboard all the old, losing much thereby.The medical profession has one of the greatest and most beautiful records in theworld of its purpose and field of activity, and has developed some of thegreatest of the soul qualities—self-sacrifice, compassion and service. But theways and the techniques of the New Age are hard to grasp. Much of the old wayshave to be given up and much sacrificed before the new art of healing becomespossible.[69] Until the fact of the subtler bodies is properly recognised by the worldthinkers, and their existence is established through a right and true science ofpsychology and the development of the faculty of clairvoyance, the tracing ofthe causes of disease back to the subtler bodies is relatively meaningless. Thebest reaction which the most open-minded physician can (I say can and not will )produce or admit is that the psychological attitude, the mental state, and theemotional condition of the patient do either help or hinder. Many are alreadyadmitting that. That in itself is much.When, therefore, I say that cancer, for instance, has its roots in an astralcondition and began its career in Atlantean times, it means but little to theaverage man today. He does not realise that large numbers of people today areAtlantean in their consciousness.I want briefly to touch upon the most common of all causes of trouble: Worry andIrritation. They are more prevalent at this time than ever before, and for thefollowing reasons:1. The world situation is such, the problems and uncertainty are such, thatscarcely a person in the world at this time is exempt. Everyone is more or lessinvolved in the planetary situation.2. The intercommunication between people has increased so much, and men live somuch in massed groups—large or small—that it is inevitable that they produce aneffect upon each other as never before. “If one member suffers, all the memberssuffer with it” is a statement of truth, ancient but new in application andtoday realised for the first time.3. The increased sensitivity of the human mechanism is also such that men “tunein” on each other’s emotional conditions and mental attitudes in a new and morepotent [70] manner. To their own engrossing concerns and worries are added thoseof their fellowmen with whom they may be en rapport.4. Telepathically, and also with a developed sense of prevision, men are todayadding the difficulties that belong to someone else, or to some other group ofthinkers and of people, to the difficulties that may be. It is not sure thatthey will be.These problems will demonstrate to you how intensely difficult it is for men toface up to life. It will be obvious that the problems of worry and irritation(called by the Master Morya “imperil”) are many and must be considered.Why are these difficulties of the astral body so “perilous” and so serious?Worry and Irritation are dangerous because:1. They lower the vitality of the man to such a point that he becomessusceptible to disease. The scourge of influenza has its roots in fear andworry, and once the world settles down to freedom from the present “fearful”condition, we shall see the disease die out.2. They are so highly infectious from the astral point of view that they lowerin a peculiar manner the astral atmosphere, and thus make it hard for people—inthe astral sense—to breathe freely.3. Because the astral conditions of fear, worry and irritation are so widespreadtoday that they might be regarded as epidemic, in a planetary sense.4. Because irritation (I speak not here of worry) is inflammatory in itseffects—and inflammation is hard to bear—and leads to much difficulty. It isinteresting to note that certain forms of eye trouble are caused by this.[71]5. Because worry and irritation prevent true vision. They shut out the view. Theman who is the victim of these conditions sees nothing but the cause of hiscomplaints and is so submerged through self-pity, self-consideration, or in afocussed negative condition, that his vision is narrowed and his group hindered.Remember that there is group selfishness as well as individual selfishness.I have cited sufficient reasons for the effects of Worry and Irritation todemonstrate to you the wideness of the difficulty. It is not much use at thistime to talk of the remedy. One does not say to an influenza patient (when theworst throes of the disease are upon him), “There is nothing the matter. Pay noattention. Get up and go about your business.” It is no use saying to men today,“Do not fear. Leave off worrying. All will be well.” They will not believe you,for one thing—and that is fortunate, for it is not true. Things are not well andhumanity and the planetary life are not well. This, the Hierarchy knows, and isworking for the amelioration of the conditions. When the throes of the“planetary influenza” are over (and the patient will not die), theninvestigation can be made and effort produced which can prevent a recurrence. Atpresent, all that can be done is to keep the patient quiet and also keep thefever down. This is the work of the New Group of World Servers and theintelligent men of goodwill. Their name is Legion.2. CAUSES ARISING IN THE ETHERIC BODYIt will be wise for you to bear in mind that I am not here going to deal withthose causes which, producing effects in the physical body, arise in the mind orin the astral body. Necessarily they pass through the etheric body. The ethericbody is a transmitter of all energies to the physical body, [72] and all typesof force pass through it to different parts of the physical form, producing goodand bad results, negative or positive results, as the case may be. This is afact which we accept. I am here considering the diseases, problems and physicaldifficulties which arise in the etheric body itself and work out in itsrelations to the physical body. These are quite widespread and usual. It isessential that you keep these two lines of force-activity clearly differentiatedin your mind. Both pass through and from the etheric body into the physicalbody, but only one of them originates in or is concerned with difficulties whichhave an etheric origin.The etheric body is a body composed entirely of lines of force and of pointswhere these lines of force cross each other and thus form (in crossing) centresof energy. Where many such lines of force cross each other, you have a largercentre of energy, and where great streams of energy meet and cross, as they doin the head and up the spine, you have seven major centres. There are sevensuch, plus twenty-one lesser centres and forty-nine smaller centres known to theesotericists. However, we will confine ourselves at this time to the ethericbody as a whole and to the seven major centres. It might be of interest to you,nevertheless, to be told where the twenty-one minor centres are to be found.They can be located at the following points:There are two of them in front of the ears close to where the jaw bones areconnected.There are two of them just above the two breasts.There is one where the breast bones meet, close to the thyroid gland. This, withthe two breast centres, makes a triangle of force.There are two, one each in the palms of the hands. [73]There are two, one each in the soles of the feet.There are two, just behind the eyes.There are two also connected with the gonads.There is one close to the liver.There is one connected with the stomach; it is related, therefore, to the solarplexus, but is not identical with it.There are two connected with the spleen. These form one centre in reality, butsuch a centre is formed by the two being superimposed one on the other.There are two—one at the back of each knee.There is one powerful centre which is closely connected with the vagus nerve.This is most potent and is regarded by some schools of occultism as a majorcentre; it is not in the spine, but is no great distance from the thymus gland.There is one which is close to the solar plexus, and relates it to the centre atthe base of the spine, thus making a triangle of the sacral centre, the solarplexus, and the centre at the base of the spine.The two triangles referred to in this tabulation are of real importance. One isabove and the other below the diaphragm.It is of course apparent that where there is a free flow of force through theetheric body into the dense physical body there will be less likelihood ofdisease or sickness. There may, however, be increased tendency to difficultiesarising from overstimulation and its consequent results of overactivity of thenervous system, with all the attendant problems. These forces, seeking inletinto the dense vehicle, are emanations from three directions (if I may use sucha term): [74]1. From the personality vehicles—the astral and mental bodies.2. From the soul, if contact, recognised or unrecognised, has been established.3. From the environing world to which the vehicles of the soul and of thepersonality have acted as “doors of entrance.” Incidentally, in connection withthis last phrase, I would call your attention to a possible relation betweenthese “doors of entrance” and the phrase “door of initiation.”In the case where these centres, through which the inflowing energy from thesesources of supply flow, are quiescent, unawakened or only functioning partiallyor too slowly (as far as their vibratory rhythm is concerned), then you willhave a condition of blocking. This will produce congestion in the ethericvehicle, and consequent and subsequent difficulties in the functioning of thephysical body. One of the most common of these is congestion of the lungswhich—though it may be exoterically traced to certain and definite physicalcauses—is in reality those causes, plus an inner condition of ethericcongestion. It is the bringing together of the outer apparent cause and theinner true cause which is responsible for the outbreak of the trouble. Whenthese two conditions are brought into conjunction with each other, and you havea physical handicap and an etheric situation which is undesirable, then you willhave disease, illness, or weakness of some kind. Every outer congestion canalways be traced to these two causes—an inner and an outer cause. In thesecases, the outer cause is not an effect of the individual inner cause, which isinteresting. You will note, therefore, that all ills are not purely subjectiveor psychological in origin as far as an individual is concerned, [75] but aresometimes both exoteric and esoteric. Hence the complication of the problem.The above statement opens up the whole question of the activity of the sevencentres of force in the etheric body. These can be regarded as dormant orunawakened, awakening but only as yet sluggishly alive, or functioning normally,which means that some of the energies which produce the form of the centre aremoving rhythmically, and are therefore receptive to inflow, while others arestill entirely inactive and unresponsive. Other centres will be fully active,and therefore predominantly attractive to any inflowing forces; still otherswill be only partially so. For the majority of people, the centres below thediaphragm are more active than those above the diaphragm (I am referring here tothe seven major centres and not to the twenty-one minor centres). For aspirants,centres below the diaphragm are active and the heart and throat centres areslowly coming into activity, while in the case of disciples, the ajna centre,plus those centres below it in the body, are rapidly awakening. In the initiate,the head centre is coming into vibrant activity, thus swinging all the centresinto real and coordinated rhythm. Each patient or human being, being on someray, responds differently; the time factor also differs; the pattern of theunfoldment varies, and the response to the inflowing forces is slightlydifferentiated.All of this we will consider with due care when we deal with Chapter IX, whichconcerns itself with the seven modes of healing. I simply mention it here so asto lay the foundation for what must later be considered, and thus show you howthe whole question of the relation of the etheric body to the physical body isconnected with the problem of healing. It will be apparent, therefore, howimportant it is—before real healing can take place—that the healer should knowthe point in evolution reached by [76] the patient, and should also know his raytype, both personality and egoic. If to this you add some knowledge of hisastrological inclinations and indications, a far more accurate diagnosis can beproduced. The key to all release (either through the physical cure of disease orthrough death) lies in the understanding of the condition of the centres in theetheric body. These determine the rate of the bodily vibratory activity and thegeneral responsiveness of the physical body. They even condition the activityand accuracy of the instinctual nature and its relation to the outer plane lifeand the “wholeness” and general health of the sympathetic nervous system.A. Congestion.Much real difficulty can be traced to congestion or to the lack of the free playof the forces. In this connection it might be pointed out that the etheric bodyis a mechanism for intake and for outlet. There is consequently a curious andintimate relation between it and such organs as the lungs, the stomach, and thekidneys. The symbology here present, when correctly understood, will tend toshow that there is a deep underlying esoteric relation between:1. The mind and the lungs. The process of breathing, with its stages ofinhalation, the interlude, and exhalation, works out in connection with bothaspects of force, mental and physical.2. The desire nature and the stomach. Here again is the process of intake, ofassimilation, and of elimination.3. The etheric body itself and the kidneys, with the processes clearly definedin both cases of absorption, chemicalisation, and transmission.There is no symbol so relatively accurate to the whole [77] creative process asthe human frame.Congestion in the etheric body, producing much distress in the physical body,can exist, therefore, at the point of intake from the astral body or from theastral plane (Note the phrasing and the difference.) or at the point of outlet,in relation to the centre to which the particular type of etheric force mosteasily flows and through which it most easily passes. Where there is no freeplay between the etheric body and the astral body, you will have trouble. Wherethere is no free play between the etheric body and the physical body, involvingalso the nerve ganglia and the endocrine system, you will also have trouble. Theclose relation between the seven major centres and the seven major glands of thephysical system must never be forgotten. The two systems form one closeinterlocking directorate, with the glands and their functions determined by thecondition of the etheric centres. These, in their turn, are conditioned by thepoint in evolution and gained experience of the incarnate soul, by the specificpolarisation of the soul in incarnation, and by the rays (personality and soul)of the man. Forget not, that the five aspects of man (as he functions in thethree worlds) are determined by certain ray forces; you have the ray of thesoul, the ray of the personality, and the rays of the mental, the astral and thephysical bodies. All these will, in the coming New Age, be definitely consideredand discovered, and this knowledge will reveal to the healer the probablecondition of the centres, the order of their awakening, and their individual andbasic note or notes. The new medical science will be outstandingly built uponthe science of the centres, and upon this knowledge all diagnosis and possiblecure will be based. The endocrinologist is only beginning to glimpsepossibilities, and much that he is now considering has in it the seeds of futuretruth. The “balancing of the glandular system” [78] and the relation of theglands to the blood stream, and also to character and predispositions of manykinds, are considerations of real value and worth following. Much, however,remains to be discovered before it will be really safe to work with the glands,making them a major subject of attention (as some day will be the case in allforms of illness).Throughout this short treatise I will give many hints which will serve to guidethe open minded investigator in the right direction. Before passing on to theconsideration of the relation of the etheric body, as a unit, to the physicalbody, I would like to point out that I place the complications of congestionfirst upon the list of diseases arising in the etheric body, because it is atthis time—and will be for a couple of centuries—the major cause of difficultyfor the bulk of humanity or of those people whom we esoterically call“solar-sacral” people. This is partly due to the age-long habits of suppressionand of inhibition which the race, as a whole, has developed. It is thiscongestion at the point of intake and of outlet in the etheric body which isresponsible for the impeding of the free flow of the life force, with theresults of a rapid succumbing to diseases. Hence, also, you will see howcarefully assigned breathing exercises, with their subtle effects ofreorganising and readjusting the subtler bodies (particularly the etheric andastral bodies) will become more and more generally used. The widespread interestin breathing today evidences a subjective recognition of this fact, though notenough is yet known about methods and effects.One other thing I would like to call to your attention is that the points ofcongestion may exist either in the astral body centre or in the etheric body,and this situation the healer will have to investigate. [79]B. Lack of Coordination and Integration.We come now to a brief consideration of our second point of difficulty to befound in the etheric body, which in our tabulation we have called lack ofcoordination or integration. This is exceedingly prevalent today and isresponsible for a good deal of trouble. The etheric body is the inner“substantial” form upon which the physical body is built or constructed. It isthe inner scaffolding which underlies every part of the whole outer man; it isthe framework which sustains the whole; it is that upon which the outer form ispatterned; and it is the network of nadis (infinitely intricate) whichconstitutes the counterpart or the duplicate aspect of the entire nervous systemwhich forms such an important part of the human mechanism. It is thusdefinitely, with the blood stream, the instrument of the life force. If,therefore, there is weakness in the relation between this inner structure andthe outer form, it will be immediately apparent to you that real difficulty isbound to supervene. This difficulty will take three forms:1. The physical form in its dense aspect is too loosely connected with theetheric form or counterpart. This leads to a devitalised and debilitatedcondition, which predisposes man to sickness or ill health.2. The connection is poor in certain directions or aspects of the equipment.Through certain focal points or centres the life force cannot adequately flow,and therefore you have a definite weakness in some part of the physical body.For instance, impotence is such a difficulty and a tendency to laryngitis isanother—to mention two widely different disorders.3. The connection can also be so basically loose and poor that the soul has verylittle hold upon its vehicle [80] for outer manifestation, and obsession orpossession is easily established. This is an extreme example of the difficultiesincident to this condition. Others are certain forms of fainting or loss ofconsciousness and “petit mal.”There are also, as will be apparent, the exactly reverse conditions when theetheric body is so closely knit or integrated with the personality—whether it isof a highly evolved nature or simply an example of an ordinary etheric body—thatevery part of the physical body is in a constant condition of stimulation, ofgalvanic effort, with a resultant activity in the nervous system which—if notcorrectly regulated—can lead to a great deal of distress. It is to this that Irefer in the third heading, “Overstimulation of the Centres.” Too loose aconnection or too close a connection leads to trouble, though the first kind ofdifficulty is usually more serious than the others. I have here given enough toshow how interesting and how important a study of the etheric body may be. Thewhole theme of healing is “tied up” (to use a modern phrase which I finddifficult) with the development, unfoldment and control of the seven majorcentres.C. Overstimulation of the Centres.There is much that I could add to what I have said on the cause of diseasearising in the etheric body, but in Part II (when dealing with the section oncertain basic requirements) I shall elaborate the theme much further.Congestion, lack of integration and over-stimulation of the centres, areobviously fundamental causes as far as the dense physical body is concerned, butthey themselves are frequently effects of subtler causes, hidden in the life ofthe astral and mental bodies and, in the case of overstimulation, [81] theresult sometimes of soul contacts. The etheric body reacts normally, and bydesign, to all the conditions found in the subtler vehicles. It is essentially atransmitter and not an originator and it is only the limitations of the observerwhich lead him to ascribe the causes of bodily ills to the etheric body. It is aclearing house for all the forces reaching the physical body, provided the pointin evolution has brought the various force centres to a condition wherein theyare receptive to any particular type of force. Esoterically speaking, thecentres can be in one of five conditions or states of being. These can bedescribed in the following terms:1. Closed, still and shut, and yet with signs of life, silent and full of deepinertia.2. Opening, unsealed, and faintly tinged with colour; the life pulsates.3. Quickened, alive, alert in two directions; the two small doors are open wide.4. Radiant and reaching forth with vibrant note to all related centres.5. Blended they are and each with each works rhythmically. The vital force flowsthrough from all the planes. The world stands open wide.Related to these five stages, wherein the etheric body expands and becomes thevital livingness of all expression upon the physical plane, are the five racesof men, beginning with the Lemurian race, the five planes of human andsuperhuman expression, the five stages of consciousness and the various othergroupings of five with which you meet in the esoteric philosophy. Incidentallyit might be of value and of interest to point out that the five-pointed star isnot only the sign and symbol of initiation and finally perfected man, but it isalso the basic symbol of the etheric [82] body and of the five centres whichcontrol perfected man—the two head centres, the heart centre, the throat centreand the centre at the base of the spine. When these centres are fully awakenedand functioning in right rhythm with each other, the various quintuplets towhich I have referred above form an integral part of the consciousness of theperfected man.Though this particular piece of information is not definitely related to theScience of Healing, yet the entire subject is related to energy, and energy insome form or another is related to the causes and the effects of disease,because disease is the undesirable effect of energy upon the energy unit whichwe call the atom.It should be remembered that the etheric body of the human being is an integralpart of the etheric body of the planetary Logos and is, therefore, related toall forms found within that body in any and all the kingdoms in nature. It ispart of the substance of the universe, coordinated with planetary substance, andhence provides the scientific basis for unity.If you were to ask me what, in reality, lies behind all disease, allfrustrations, error and lack of divine expression in the three worlds, I wouldsay it was separativeness which produces the major difficulties arising in theetheric body, plus the inability of the outer tangible form to respondadequately to the inner and subtler impulses. Here is found the cause (thesecondary cause, as I pointed out above) of the bulk of the trouble. The ethericbody of the planet does not yet freely transmit and circulate the forces whichare seeking entrance into the consciousness and the expression of man upon thephysical plane. These forces emanate from within himself as he functions on thesubtler levels of consciousness and from the soul; they come also fromassociated and contacted groups, from the planetary life, [83] and eventually,in the last analysis, from the entire universe. Each of the centres can, whenfully awakened and consciously and scientifically employed, serve as an opendoor through which awareness of that which lies beyond the individual human lifecan enter. The etheric body is fundamentally the most important responseapparatus which man possesses, producing not only the right functioning of thefive senses and consequently providing five major points of contact with thetangible world, but it also enables a man to register sensitively the subtlerworlds, and, when energised and controlled by the soul, the spiritual realmsstand wide open also.The etheric body is a potent receiver of impressions, which are conveyed to thehuman consciousness through the medium of the awakened centres. There is, forinstance, no true clairvoyance until either the solar plexus or the ajna centreis awakened. These transmitted impressions and information become the incentivewhereby conscious activity is initiated. There are many words used to describethese forces and their actuating effects: such as impulses, incentives,influences, potencies, desires, aspirations, and many such terms which are onlysynonyms for force or energy and thus convey the same general idea. All of thesewords refer to forms of activity of the etheric body, but only as the physicalbody registers them and acts under their impression. The whole theme ofmotivating force is one of great interest.The vastness of the subject is, however, so real that only little by little canhumanity grasp the situation and come to the realisation that man is essentially(through his etheric body) an integral part of a great and vibrant Whole; onlyin time will he learn that, through the processes of evolution, can he hope toregister all the different areas of divine expression. Only when the ethericbody is swept into [84] activity under the influence and through the “impressedforces” of the soul, the mind, and temporarily, of the astral body, can manbecome aware of all worlds, all phenomena, and all states of consciousness, andso achieve that omniscience which is the birth right of all the sons of God.But, during the period wherein this state of being is in process of achievement,the lack of development, the failure to register, the life work of awakening andorganising the various centres and of then correctly relating them to eachother, produces much difficulty. It is this condition which is the fruitfulsource of those difficulties which, when carried down into the physical body,produce disease of various kinds, the many tensions and congestions, theoverstimulation of the centres in one part of the etheric vehicle and theirunderdevelopment in another, plus the unequal unfoldment and wrong balance ofthe centres.Much is said today in modern medical investigation anent the “imbalance” of theendocrine glands, and many physical difficulties are ascribed to this frequentimbalance. But behind this condition of the glandular system lies the basicimbalance of the centres themselves. Only when there is a right understanding offorce and its reception and consequent use, will right balance be achieved andthe human endocrine system control the physical man in the manner that isintended.There is much need today for the study of the following problems:1. The problem of the right reception of force through the appropriate centre.An instance of this might be found in the correct control of the solar plexuscentre as the one in which astral sensitivity can be registered and properlyhandled.[85]2. The problem of the right relation of a particular centre to its relatedgland, permitting the free play of the force pouring through the centre to theallied glandular correspondence, thus conditioning its peculiar hormone andeventually conditioning the blood stream. If you grasp this sequence of contact,you will understand more clearly the occult significance of the words in the OldTestament that “the blood is the life.” It is the vitality coming from theetheric body which works through into the blood stream, via the centre which isresponsive to one of the seven peculiar types of force, and its allied gland. Itwill be apparent, therefore, that there is a close relation between:a. The etheric body as a transmitter of a vast aggregate of energies and forces.b. The endocrine system whose various glands are in reality the externalisationor materialisation of the centres, major and minor.c. The heart, which is the centre of life as the brain is the centre ofconsciousness. From the heart, the blood circulates and is controlled. Thusthese three great systems are related.d. The entire glandular system to the nervous system through the medium of thenetwork of nerves and the “nadis” which underlie this network. These nadis arethe threads of life force which underlie every part of the body and particularlythe nervous system in all its aspects.To these problems and relationships another might be added. This is theinterrelation which must be established between all the centres, permitting thefree play of force in correct rhythm throughout the physical vehicle.[86] You have, therefore, certain great interlocking directorates which controlor fail to control the physical body. Where there is lack of control it is dueto the failure to establish right relations within the body, or to lack ofdevelopment. These interlocking groups are:1. That of the etheric body, which works primarily through its seven majorcentres but also through many other centres.2. That of the endocrine system, which works primarily through the seven majorglandular groups, but also through many other less important glands.3. That of the nervous system (the sympathetic and the cerebro-spinal) with apeculiar emphasis laid upon the vagus nerve with its effect upon the heart andconsequently upon the blood stream.All these points have to be considered and correlated in any system of occulthealing, and the technical matter to be covered is, in the last analysis, lessintricate than the vast system built up by orthodox medicine and surgery. It isbecause of the lack of coordination of these three systems that the healing artis at this time failing to achieve all that it desires. It has done much, butmust move another step onto the etheric plane before the real clue to diseaseand its cure can be ascertained.For instance, lack of vitality and the common subnormal conditions with which weare so familiar, indicate the inertia of the etheric body and its lack ofvitality. The results of this inertness of the vital body can be both physicaland psychological, because the glands in the physical body will not functionnormally and, as is well known, they condition the physical expression of man aswell as his emotional and mental states, in so far as those are able or not ableto [87] find expression through the medium of the physical vehicle. The glandsdo not condition the inner man or his states of consciousness, but they can anddo prevent those inner states finding manifestation outwardly. In the reversesituation, too powerful an etheric body and the overstimulation of the centresconcerned, may put too great a strain upon the nervous system and produce, as aconsequence, definite nervous trouble, migraine, mental and emotional imbalanceand, in some cases, lead to insanity.I have elaborated this matter somewhat because the relation of the etheric bodyto the physical body and its receptivity to the inner energies most decidedlycondition the man. It will be necessary for us to have this ever in mind as westudy the causes of the diseases arising in the mental body, or due to theactivity of the soul in the life of the disciple, or as we investigate theprocesses whereby a man is prepared for initiation. The etheric body mustalways, and invariably does, act as the transmitting agent of the inner energiesto the outer plane, and the physical body has to learn to respond to andrecognise that which is transmitted. The effectiveness of the transmission andthe resultant physical activity depend always upon the centres, which, in theirturn, condition the glands; these, later, determine the nature and the expressedconsciousness of the man. If the centres are awakened and receptive, there willbe found a physical apparatus which will be responsive to the forces flowingthrough. If the centres are asleep, and thus little force can be transmitted,you will find a physical apparatus which will be equally slow and unresponsive.If the centres below the diaphragm are awakened and those above are not, youwill have a man whose consciousness will be focussed in the animal and theemotional natures, and much of his physical disease will lie below the diaphragmalso. You will see, therefore, how intricate and complex [88] this whole matteris—so complex that it will only be truly understood when human beings regain thelost power to “see the light” of the etheric body and of its seven major centresand, through a developed sense of touch in the hands and fingers, to ascertainthe rate of vibration in the various centres. When these two means of knowledgeare available, the entire subject of the etheric body will take on a newimportance and be correctly understood.3. CAUSES ARISING IN THE MENTAL BODYI started this section of our study with the causes arising in the astral andetheric bodies because they are the major sources of trouble, owing to the factthat the bulk of humanity is astrally focussed, just as the bulk of the forms inthe animal kingdom are etherically focussed. The forces pouring into the animalkingdom come predominantly from etheric levels and from the dense physicallevels of life. The higher animals, however, owing to the development broughtabout through their contact with human beings, are becoming susceptible toforces coming from the astral plane, and they thus develop actions and reactionswhich are not purely instinctual.Today, owing to the development of the mind in the Aryan race, certaindifficulties may arise in the physical body. Their origin is not basicallymental but primarily due to the fact that the mental body is the transmitter(when active and rightly aligned) of soul energy and this soul energy, pouringinto the physical body, can produce certain conditions of overstimulation anddifficulties connected with the nervous system. But it is the transmitted energywhich causes the trouble and not the factor arising from the mind itself. I willelaborate this a little later. [89]A. Wrong Mental Attitudes.I would like to deal, first of all, with the basic premise that disease andphysical liabilities are not the result of wrong thought. They are far morelikely to be the result of no thought at all, or are caused by the failure tofollow those fundamental laws which govern the Mind of God. One interestinginstance of this failure is the fact that man does not follow the basic Law ofRhythm, which governs all the processes of nature, and man is a part of nature.It is to this failure to work with the Law of Periodicity that we can trace muchof the difficulty inherent in the use and the misuse of the sex urge. Instead ofman being governed by the cyclic manifestation of the sex impulse, and his life,therefore, being ruled by a definite rhythm, there exists at this time no suchthing, except in the cycles through which the female passes, and littleattention is paid to these. The male, however, is not governed by any suchcycles, and has broken in also on the rhythm to which the female body should besubordinated, and which—rightly understood—would determine the use of the sexrelationship, including naturally the male impulse also. This failure to live bythe Law of Periodicity and to subordinate the appetites to cyclic control is oneof the major causes of disease; and as these laws are given form on the mentalplane, one might legitimately say that their infringement has a mental basis.This might be the case if the race were working mentally, but it is not. It isin the modern world of today that there is beginning a widespread infringementof these mental laws, particularly of the Law of Cycles, which determines thetides, controls world events and should also condition the individual and soestablish rhythmic life habits—one of the major predisposing incentives to goodhealth.[90] By breaking this Law of Rhythm, man has disorganised the forces which,rightly used, tend to bring the body into a sound and healthy condition; by sodoing, he has laid the foundation for that general debility and those inherentorganic tendencies which predispose a man to ill health and which permitentrance into the system of those germs and bacteria which produce the outerforms of malignant disease. When humanity regains an understanding of the rightuse of time (which determines the Law of Rhythm on the physical plane), and candetermine the proper cycles for the various manifestations of the life forceupon the physical plane, then what was earlier an instinctual habit will becomethe intelligent usage of the future. This will constitute an entirely newscience, and the rhythm of the natural processes and the establishing, ashabits, the correct cycles of physical functioning, will bring about a new eraof health and of sound physical conditions for the entire race. I used the word“establishing,” for as the focus of racial attention shifts into the region ofthe higher values the physical vehicle will gain enormously, and goodhealth—through right rhythmic living, plus correct thinking and soulcontact—will become permanently established.There are, therefore, very few ills to which flesh is heir which are mentallybased. It is exceedingly difficult to establish what they are. There are tworeasons for this statistical failure:1. The fact that very few, relatively speaking of the race are mentallypolarised and therefore thinking.2. The fact that the bulk of diseases are etheric or astral.Another factor producing this difficulty is that the thinking and the emotionalreactions of man are so closely interrelated that it is not easy at this stagein evolution to [91] separate feeling and thought, or to say that such or suchills arise in the astral or the mental body, or that certain ills are due towrong feeling and others to wrong thinking. Speaking in terms of the entirehuman family, the thinking that is done in the world of today, is done by therelatively few. The rest are occupied with feeling, with sensuous perception andwith the many and differing aspects of emotionalism such as irritability, worry,acute anxiety, aspiration towards some desired end or goal, depression, plus thedramatic life of the senses and of the “I in the centre” consciousness. Few livein the world of thought and fewer still in the world of reality. When they do,the result is inevitably a better average of health, because there is betterintegration, and as a result a freer play of the life forces throughout thevehicles of expression.B. Mental Fanaticism. The Dominance of Thoughtforms.I would point out here that the diseases and difficulties which arise from whatI have called wrong mental attitudes, fanaticisms and frustrated idealisms andthwarted hopes, fall into three categories, and a study of these will show youthat, in the last analysis, they are not of mental origin at all, but primarilyare the result of emotionalism entering in.1. Those incident to the imposed physical plane activity and work which findtheir incentive in these mental conditions. They lead, for instance, to furiousactivity and overwork, due to the determination not to be frustrated but to makethe plan work. The result is frequently the breaking down of the nervous system,which could have been avoided had the mental condition been changed and rightrhythm on the physical plane achieved. But it was the work of a physical naturewhich caused the trouble far more than the mental condition. [92]2. Those brought about by the state of rebellion which colours all the life, andthe registering of violent emotional reactions. These may be based upon a mentalrealisation of the Plan, for instance, plus a recognition that those plans arenot materialising, owing often to the inadequacy of the physical equipment; butthe basic cause of the disease is the emotional rebellion, and therefore not themental condition. Bitterness, disgust, hatred and a sense of frustration can anddo produce many of the prevalent toxic conditions and a state of generalpoisoning and ill health from which many people habitually suffer. Their visionis bigger than their accomplishment, and this causes emotional suffering. Thecure for this condition is to be found in the simple word acceptance . This isnot a negative state of settling down to a submissive nonactive life, but it isa positive acceptance (in thought and in practical expression) of a conditionwhich seems at present unavoidable. This leads to an avoidance of the waste oftime in attempting the impossible and to right effort to carry forward thatwhich is possible.3. Those difficulties which are caused by the failure of the physical apparatusto measure up to the demands of the thought life of the individual. These are,naturally and usually, a part of the physical inheritance, and where this is thecase there is normally nothing much to do, though where the aspiration is realand persistent, a great deal might be accomplished in bringing about improvementand laying the ground for better functioning in another life cycle.It is necessary here that I should deal, as briefly as possible, with theproblem of mental healing and with the teaching that all disease is the productof wrong thought. You are starting out to work, and I would have clear thinkingon this point. The two problems which I have posited [93] are closely related.We could express them in the form of two questions:1. Is disease the result of thought?2. Can the power of thought produce healing effects when used by an individualor a group?In view of the fact that many diseases are, as I have told you, latent in thevery material of the planet itself, it is obvious that human thought is notresponsible for disease. It antedates the arrival of humanity upon the planet.There is disease in the mineral world, in the vegetable kingdom, and also amonganimals, even in their wild states and in their natural habitat, uncontaminatedby man. Hence, man cannot be held responsible for this, nor is it the result ofhuman wrong thinking. It provides no answer to the question to say that it musttherefore be due to the wrong thinking of the planetary Logos or of the solarLogos. This is only a begging of the question and an evasion of the issue.I would here remind you of the two definitions of the causes of disease which Iearlier gave. Let me call them to your careful attention:“All disease is the result of inhibited soul life. This is true of all forms inall kingdoms.”“Disease is the product of and subject to three influences. First, a man’s pastwherein he pays the price of ancient error. Second, his inheritance wherein heshares with all mankind those tainted streams of energy which are of grouporigin. Thirdly, he shares with all the natural forms that which the Lord ofLife imposes on those forms. Those three influences are called the Ancient Lawof evil Sharing . This must give place some day to that new Law of AncientDominating Good . This law will be brought into activity by the spiritual willof man.”[94] If you analyse the four causes of disease here given, you will note thatdisease will eventually be controlled by the release of the soul in all forms,and that this will be done by the active use by man of his spiritual will. Wecould word this otherwise and say that when soul energy and the right use of thewill (which in the individual is the reflection and the agent of the will energyof the soul) is released and rightly directed by the mind, then disease can behandled and brought eventually to an end. It is therefore by the imposition of ahigher energy and of a higher rhythm upon the lower forces that disease can becontrolled. Disease is therefore the result in the physical body of the failureto bring in these higher energies and rhythms, and that, in its turn, isdependent upon the point in evolution.It is the dim sensing of this failure and the realisation of these facts thathas brought so many groups to believe in the cure of disease by thought powerand to ascribe the appearance of disease to wrong thinking. But in reality,humanity must some day learn that it is only the higher consciousness of thesoul, working through the mind, that can finally solve this difficult problem.We cannot consequently affirm that disease, as a general rule, has any relationto thought. It is simply the misuse of the forces of the etheric, the astral andof the dense physical levels. The majority of people are helpless to do anythingabout it, as the forces which constitute the physical body, for instance, andwhich pass through and play upon it, are inherited from a very ancient past, area constituent part of the environment and of the group life into which they areintegrated and which they share with all their fellowmen. Such force-matter iscoloured with the results of ancient wrong rhythms, misused forces and inheritedqualities. Soul energy, expressed through right thinking, can cure diseases towhich man is prone. It is failure to think and to register [95] and express thehigher states of consciousness which leads to wrong rhythms. Consequently, Irepeat that disease is not the result of thought.C. Frustrated Idealism.There are, however, certain diseases which appear in the physical mechanism andwhich are definitely rooted in the fact that activity (which is the result ofthinking specifically) has been coloured and conditioned by the emotional lifeof the individual, and the emotional life is a fruitful source of disease and ofestablishing wrong rhythms. It is therefore the predominance of the astralforce, and not of the mental energy, which really causes the physical trouble. Iam not referring here to the diseases of the nervous system and of the brain,which are the result of overstimulation and of the impact of energy (often fromthe mind and the soul) upon an instrument unfitted to handle it. These we willconsider later. I refer simply to the following sequence of events in thepsychological life and the consequent resultant activities:Disease is a form of activity.1. Mental activity and energy produces (through the power of thought) certainregistration of plans, idealisms and ambitions.2. This energy, blended with astral energy, becomes dominated and controlled byastral reactions of an undesirable kind, such as worry over non-accomplishment,the failure to materialise the plans, etc. The life becomes consequentlyembittered.3. Disease then appears in the physical body, according to the predisposingtendencies of the body and its inherent, inherited weaknesses.[96] You will note that, in reality, the mental body, and the power of thought,have in no case been the cause of trouble. It has been caused by theobliteration of the original thought and its stepping down to the level ofemotionalism. When this stepping down and eventual control by astral forces doesnot take place, and the thought remains clear and untouched upon the mentalplane, there may be trouble of another kind, due to a failure to “carry through”the thought into effective action upon the physical plane. This failure producesnot only the cleavage in the personality so well known to the practicingpsychologist, but also a cutting off of a much needed stream of energy. As aconsequence, the physical body is devitalised and falls heir to bad health. Whenthe thought can be carried through to the physical brain and there becomes adirecting agent of the life force, you will usually have a condition of goodhealth, and this has proved true whether the individual thought has been good orbad, rightly motivated or wrongly oriented. It is simply the effect ofintegration, because saints and sinners, the selfish and the unselfish and allkinds of people, can achieve integration and a thought-directed life.The second question asks whether an individual or a group can heal by thoughtpower.Most certainly the generalisation can be made that an individual and a group canheal and that thought can play its potent part in the healing process, but notthought alone and unaided. Thought can be the directing agency of forces andenergies which can disrupt and dispel disease, but the process must be aided bythe power to visualise, by an ability to work with particular forces as isdeemed advisable, by an understanding of the rays and their types of energies,and also by a capacity to handle light substance, as it is called. To thesepowers must be added the ability to be en rapport with the one to be healed,plus a loving heart. In [97] fact, once these conditions are met, too much useof the thinking faculty and too potent a use of the mind processes can arrestand hinder the healing work. Thought has to condition the initial incentive,bringing the intelligence of the man to bear upon the problem of healing and acomprehension of the nature of the one to be healed; but once it has aided infocussing the attention of the healer and the healing group, it should become asteady but subconscious directive agent and nothing more than that.The healing is accomplished, when possible, by the use of energy rightlydirected and by detailed visualisation; love also plays a great part, as doesthe mind in the early stage. Perhaps I should say that a loving heart is one ofthe most potent of all the energies employed.I have brought these two questions to your attention because I am anxious foryour minds to be clear upon these problems before you start any group work inhealing.Thought neither cures disease nor causes it. Thought must be employed in theprocesses, but it is not the sole or the most important agent. It is on thispoint that many groups and healers go astray. The mind can direct energy andthis energy can, in its turn, produce overstimulation of the brain and of thebody cells and so cause nervous trouble and sometimes brain disease, but themind itself and thinking, per se, cannot cause disease and trouble in thephysical body. As the race learns to think clearly and definitely, and as thelaws of thought begin to control the racial consciousness, disease—as we nowknow it—will be greatly lessened and more and more people will achieveintegration. Where there is integration there is the free play of force and ofenergy throughout the material body. The problems of stimulation will, however,steadily increase with the growing sensitivity of the physical man and thedeveloping focus of his consciousness in the mind nature. This will go on until[98] man learns how to handle the higher energies and to recognise the need fora rhythmic life, paying attention to the Law of Periodicity.In healing work, certain rules should be mastered and followed by the healer. Ihave given three important rules already. Briefly they are as follows, and I amdividing the first one into its component parts for the sake of clarity.1. a. The healer must seek to link his soul, his heart, his brain, and hishands. Thus can he pour the vital force with healing power upon his patient.This is magnetic work .b. The healer must seek to link his soul, his brain, his heart and auricemanation. Thus can his presence feed the soul life of the patient. This is thework of radiation. The hands are needed not. The soul displays its power.2. The healer must achieve magnetic purity, through purity of life. He mustachieve that dispelling radiance which shows itself in every man once he haslinked the centres in the head. When this magnetic field has been established,the radiance then goes forth.3. Let the healer train himself to know the inner stage of thought or of desireof the one who seeks his help. He can thereby know the source from which thetrouble comes. Let him relate the cause and the effect, and know the point exactthrough which relief must come.I would here give you, as a group, another rule, making four major rules:RULE FOURThe healer and the healing group must keep the will in leash. It is not willthat must be used, but love.This last rule is of great importance. The concentrated will of any individualand the directed will of a united group [99] should never be employed. The freewill of the individual must never be subjected to the impact of a powerfullyfocussed group or individual; it is far too dangerous a procedure to bepermitted. Will energy (particularly that of a number of people simultaneouslyplaying upon the subtle and physical bodies of the one to be healed) can greatlyincrease the trouble instead of curing it. It can stimulate the disease itselfto dangerous proportions and disrupt instead of cooperating with nature’shealing forces, and can even eventually kill the person concerned by soincreasing the disease that the patient’s normal resistance can prove futile. Iwould ask you, therefore, in any group work of healing, to keep the will (andeven keen desire) in abeyance. Only initiates of high degree are permitted tocure by the power of the will, focussed in the WORD OF POWER, and this onlybecause they can test the capacity of the patient, the tension of the disease,and know also whether or no it is the will of the soul that the disease shouldbe cured.We have covered much ground of importance in this section and it will warrantyour careful study. In the next one we will take up the peculiar problems of thedisciple; I would ask you, in preparation for this, to study with attention, theteaching which I gave earlier on the diseases of the mystics. (A Treatise on theSeven Rays, Vol II, Pages 520-625.) Much said there need not be repeated by me,but should be incorporated in our teachings on healing. I suggest that you readthem and know something of the problems themselves, both theoretically and froman understanding of yourself. You should be aware of some of these difficultiesin your own experience, at least to some degree.The Sacred Art of HealingI do not intend, in this treatise, to deal with the pathology of disease, withits systems and their maleficent indications. [100] These are fully covered inany ordinary medical treatise and textbook and I, my brothers, am no trainedphysician or medical authority, nor have I the time to be engrossed with thetechnicalities. What I am concerned with is to give the world some idea of thetrue and occult causes of disease and their hidden origins, and with the work ofhealing, as it is carried on and sanctioned by the Great White Lodge.The work is, in reality, that of the judicious use of energy, applied with loveand science. All that I tell you is the result of experiment. Such healing fallsinto two categories:1. In magnetic healing , the healer, or the healing group, does two things:a. He attracts to the healing centre that type of energy which will counteractthe disease.This is necessarily a vast subject and one of deep scientific import. Certaintypes of ray force can be used with certain types of disease, necessitating theuse of certain specific centres for the distribution. These we shall considerand outline when we come to the section entitled The Seven Modes of Healing.b. He attracts to himself and absorbs those forces which are producing thedisease, drawing it forth from the patient.This latter process necessitates a careful guarding of the healer from allcontamination by the disease, so that the forces can find no place in his body.There must also be the supplying of fresh energy to the patient, in order totake the place of that which has been withdrawn. This process sets up a definiteinterplay between the healer and the patient. There is consequently some real[101] danger in this work of occult healing, and for this reason the healers intraining should bear in mind that they will work as a group and not asindividuals. The free circulation of force produces good health in theindividual or group. The free circulation of force between a healer or a healinggroup and the person to be healed can produce the cure of disease, provided itis the destiny of the man to be healed at any given time and his cooperation isgiven when possible, though this is not really essential. It facilitates morerapid results in many cases. In others, the patient’s anxiety can negate thedesired effects.2. In radiatory healing , the process is simpler and safer for the healer simplygathers power into himself and then radiates it out on to the patient in theform of a steadily outflowing stream of radiant energy. This stream of energyshould be directed to the centre nearest to the location of the disease.In this work there is no risk to the healer, but if the element of will entersinto his thought or the stream of energy projected is too strong, there may bedanger to the patient. The impact of the force which is being radiated upon himmay not only produce nervous tension, but may lead to an increase in the powerof the disease and its intensification by stimulating the atoms and cellsinvolved in the activity of the force responsible for the trouble. For thisreason beginners must avoid any concentration upon the disease itself or thearea in the physical body involved and carefully keep all thought in abeyance,once the preliminary work has been done, for energy ever follows thought andgoes where the thought is focussed. [102]The healers have to determine the effectiveness of what they are attempting andthe potency of their united group work and of the force which they can wield.They have also to discover their ability to keep the will in the background andto send the healing radiance out upon a stream of love-energy. Have ever in mindthat love is energy and that it is a substance as real as dense matter. Thatsubstance can be used to drive out diseased tissue and provide a healthysubstitute in place of the diseased material which has been eliminated.They will, therefore, in the first cycle of work, attempt the radiatory method.It is simpler and far more easily mastered. Later, they can experiment with themethod of magnetic healing.You will now see the purpose of the rules anent the modes of healing which Igave early in this series of instructions. You will realise why, in thisradiatory work, the linking process involves the soul, the brain and the entireaura or the magnetic field of individual or group activity. The mind is notmentioned or involved, and the brain acts solely as the focussing point of thelove and the healing force to be projected into the stream of energy whichissues from the ajna centre.The healer will, therefore, keep all the forces focussed in the head, and hisattention must be concentrated there also. The heart will be automaticallyinvolved, as he will be using the energy of love—at first entirely.Let us now tabulate the rules under which all healing groups must work. I wouldlike to interpolate here that it is not always necessary or possible to meet andwork together in group formation. This work can be carried forward efficientlyand potently, if the members work as a subjective group ; each should thenfollow the instructions each day [103] and as if he were working in his group intangible form. This real linking is brought about by imagining himself as in thepresence of his brothers. If they were to meet as a group upon the physicalplane, it would be hard to prevent the dissipation of force through discussion,through the ordinary pleasantries of meeting, and through the physical interplaybetween personalities. It would be inevitable that there would be too muchconversation, and the work done would not be adequately effective. From thephysical standpoint, they work alone; from the true inner standpoint, they workin the closest cooperation.Here are the first rules which I would have the student master:Preliminary Rules for Radiatory Healing1. By an act of the will, after making your own quick, conscious alignment, linkup as a soul with the souls of your group brothers. Then link up with theirminds, and then with their emotional natures. Do this by the use of theimagination, realising that energy follows thought and that the linking processis inevitable, if correctly done. You can then function as a group. Then forgetabout the group relation and concentrate upon the work to be done.2. Within yourself, then, link soul and brain and gather together the forces oflove that are to be found in your aura and focus yourself and all that you haveto offer within the head, picturing yourself as a radiant centre of energy or apoint of vivid light. This light is to be projected upon the patient through theajna centre between the eyes.3. Then say the following group mantram:“With purity of motive, inspired by a loving heart, we offer ourselves for thiswork of healing. This offer we make as a group and to the one we seek to heal.”[104] As you do this, visualise the linking process going on. See it as movinglines of living light substance, linking you to your brothers on the one hand,and to the patient on the other. See these lines going out from you to the heartcentre of the group and to the patient. But work ever from the ajna centre untilinstructed to do differently. In this way, the ajna centre and the heart centreof all the persons involved will be closely interrelated. You see here where thevalue of visualisation comes in. It is in reality the etheric externalisation ofthe creative imagination. Think this last sentence out.4. Then use thought, directed thought, for a brief moment and think of the oneyou seek to heal, linking up with him, and focussing your attention on him sothat he becomes a reality in your consciousness and close to you. When you areaware what the physical difficulty is, then simply recall it to your mind andthen dismiss it. Forget now the details of the work, such as the group, yourselfand the difficulty of the patient, and concentrate upon the type of force youare going to handle, which is, in this case and for the present, second rayforce, the force of love. What I am here giving out is an adaptation of thesecond ray method of healing, arranged for beginners.5. Feel a deep love pouring into you. Regard it as substantial light which youcan and will manipulate. Then send it out as a stream of radiant light from theajna centre and direct it through the medium of your hands to the patient. Indoing this, hold the hands before the eyes, palms outward and with the hacks ofthe hands next to the eyes and about six inches away from the face. In this way,the stream which is issuing from the ajna centre, becomes divided into two andpours out through the two hands. It is thus directed on to the patient.Visualise it as pouring out [105] and sense the patient receiving it. As you dothis, say aloud in a low voice:“May the love of the One Soul, focussed in this group, radiate upon you, mybrother, and permeate every part of your body—healing, soothing, strengthening;and dissipating all that hinders service and good health.”Say this slowly and deliberately, believing in the results. See that nothought-power or will-power enters into the stream of healing energy, but only aconcentrated radiating love. The use of the visualising faculty and of thecreative imagination, plus a sense of deep and steadfast love, will keep themind and the will in abeyance.I would emphasise the urgent necessity for complete silence and reticence inrelation to all healing work. Never let it be known by anyone that you areworking in this manner, and never mention to anyone the names of those you areseeking to aid. Do not discuss the patient under treatment even amongyourselves. If this basic rule of silence is not kept, it will indicate that youare not yet ready for this work and should discontinue it. This injunction isfar more important than you can realise; for speech and discussion not only tendto deflect and dissipate force, but violate a fundamental rule which all healersare trained to keep, and even the medical profession on the physical planefollows the same general procedure.Three Major Laws of HealthThere are three major laws of health and seven minor laws. These work out in thethree worlds, which is all that concerns you at this time. In all teaching to begiven in the immediate future, the main emphasis will eventually be laid uponthe technique of the etheric body, for that is the next step forward. The threemajor laws are: [106]1. The law controlling the will to live, a manifestation of the first aspect ofthe Logos, will or power.2. The law controlling equality of rhythm, a manifestation of the second aspectof the Logos, love or wisdom.3. The law controlling crystallisation, a manifestation of the third aspect ofthe Logos, the activity or foundational aspect.These three governing factors or laws manifest themselves through the threemajor divisions of the human entity.1. The will aspect manifests through the organs of respiration. Another of itsexpressions is the faculty of sleep. In both of these you have a repetition oran analogy in the microcosm of Logoic manifestation and Logoic pralaya.2. The love aspect shows itself through the heart, the circulatory system andthe nervous system. This is in many ways most important for you to understand,for it controls paramountly the etheric body and its assimilation of prana orvitality. This prana works through both the blood and the nerves, for the lifeforce uses the blood stream and psychic force works through the nervous system.These two departments of the human organism are those which cause the greatestamount of trouble at this time and will even more in the future. The race learnsthrough suffering, and only dire need drives man to seek solution and relief.From the present standpoint of healing, man forms again a lesser trinity ofimportance:a. The dense physical body, of which science and medicine know much. [107]b. The etheric body, which is the next field of endeavour, of experiment and ofdiscovery.c. The astral body which, simultaneously with the etheric, is the next objectfor scientific control. The science of psychology will work here.3. The activity aspect , which manifests primarily through the organs ofassimilation and elimination. I seek here to emphasise one point. Just as oursolar system is developing the love aspect, which is the second aspect, and justas the human being is polarised in the astral body, which is the reflection ofthat second aspect, so the second of the three above mentioned departments ofthe human organism, the etheric, is the one of paramount importance. Up to dateit has been the transmitter primarily of astral energy to the physical body.This is now in process of changing.The whole trend of medical science should now be awake to the concrete facts ofthe dense physical body and moving towards the study of vitalisation andcirculation, for these two are closely related. The nervous system is controlledprincipally today from the astral body, via the etheric, and the basis of allnervous trouble lies hidden in the emotional body wherein humanity at this timeis polarised. The circulatory system of the physical body is controlledprincipally from the etheric body. When you have an etheric body that is notfunctioning properly and does not transmit prana sufficiently, and when you havean astral or emotional body that is not adequately or properly controlled, youhave in these two the source of the majority of the diseases and nervous andmental conditions that are annually increasing. The reflex action of inadequatecirculation upon the physical brain (again due to the etheric body) leads tomental strain and eventual collapse. From this you can see the importance of theetheric vehicle.[108] The first aspect , which has for its expression and field of control theorgans of respiration and the faculty of sleep, when not functioning properly,produces death, insanity and some of the diseases of the brain.The third aspect , when not functioning properly, causes stomach troubles, bowelcomplaints and the various diseases that are located beneath and below the solarplexus in the abdomen.You see, therefore, how medical science must eventually seek solution in asimplification of methods and a return from a complexity of drugs and operationsto an understanding of the right use of the energies which pour through from theinner man, via the etheric body, to the physical.The following suggestions may help:1. By the development of goodwill , which is the will of good intention andmotive, will come the healing of diseases of the respiratory tract, lungs andthroat, the stabilising of the cells of the brain, the cure of insanities andobsessions, and an attainment of equilibrium and of rhythm. Longevity willensue, for death should be the recognition by the soul of work consummated andpralaya earned. It will only take place later at long and separated periods, andwill be controlled by the will of the man. He will cease to breathe when he hasfinished his work, and then will send the atoms of his body into pralaya. Thatis the sleep of the physical, the end of manifestation, and the occultsignificance of this is not yet comprehended.2. By a comprehension of the laws of vitality —and in this phrase arecomprehended the laws governing prana, radiation and magnetism—will come thehealing of the diseases in the blood, of the arteries and veins, of certainnervous complaints, lack of vitality, senile decay, poor circulation and similarills. This too will result in the [109] prolongation of life. The laws ofelectrical energy will also be better understood in this connection.3. By the understanding of right methods of assimilation and elimination willcome the healing of diseases connected with the bodily tissues, the stomach andbowels and the male and female organs of generation. It will some day beunderstood that these latter are only another system of assimilation andelimination, centred this time in the feminine aspect or woman, for againremember that this is the second or love system. The order is thus:a. The first system was masculine.b. The present system, the second, is feminine.c. The third system will be hermaphroditic.E’en though the evolving human Hierarchy is masculine or positive, yet that isno guarantee that all that is found in the present system is masculine too. Thefact is that the negative faculty or the feminine aspect dominates, even thoughthis may be unrecognised by you. Let me demonstrate and give some indication byfigures of this hypothesis:1. In the first solar system there was one dominant evolution, and it consistedof one hundred thousand million monads.2. In the present system, the second, there are two dominant evolutions, thehuman and the deva; there are—as earlier stated—sixty thousand million humanmonads. Add to this the feminine evolution of the devas , consisting of 140thousand million, and you have the necessary two hundred thousand million. Thiselucidates my statement anent this being a feminine system. [110]3. In the third solar system, the total number in evolution will be the neededthree hundred thousand million that perfection requires of the threefold Logos.Our discussion has necessarily been sketchy for all that I am here attempting todo is to give indications as to the lines along which the new art of healingmust eventually run, and to give certain hints which will point the way to thecause of the prevalent diseases, and so enable the wise to negate effects. Thisbrevity and this system of imparting knowledge through the medium of hints isessentially occult, and will be the only mode of dealing with this relativelydangerous subject until such time as a sound medical, surgical and neurologicaltraining of a technical nature is combined with an equally sound psychologicalunderstanding, plus a measure of spiritual vision. The ideal physician andsurgeon is the man who is also a metaphysician; to the lack of this combinationmuch of the present difficulty and confusion can be ascribed. The metaphysicalhealer today is so engrossed by that which is not the body that he is far lessuseful to the sick, diseased and damaged human being than is the practicalphysician. The average metaphysician, no matter by what label he calls himself,has a closed mind; he overemphasises the divine possibilities to the exclusionof the material or physical probabilities. Complete spiritual healing will bedivinely possible ultimately; but this is not materially possible at certaingiven moments in time and space and with people at widely differing points onthe ladder of evolution. Right timing and a sound knowledge of the working ofthe Law of Karma, plus a large measure of intuitive perception, are essential tothe high art of spiritual healing. To this must be added the knowledge that theform nature and the physical [111] body are not essentially the majorconsiderations or of the vast importance that some may think.Various cultists and healers usually take the position that it is of majorimportance that the physical vehicle be rendered free from disease and clutchedaway from the processes of death. It might, however, be desirable (and it oftenis) that the disease be permitted to do its work and death open the door to theescape of the soul from imprisonment. The time comes inevitably to allincarnated beings when the soul demands liberation from the body and from formlife, and nature has her own wise ways of doing this. Disease and death must berecognised as liberating factors when they come as the result of right timing bythe soul. It must be realised by students that the physical form is an aggregateof atoms, built into organisms and finally into a coherent body, and that thisbody is held together by the will of the soul. Withdraw that will onto its ownplane or (as it is occultly expressed) “let the soul’s eye turn in anotherdirection” and, in this present cycle, disease and death will inevitablysupervene. This is not mental error, or failure to recognise divinity, orsuccumbing to evil. It is, in reality, the resolution of the form nature intoits component parts and basic essence. Disease is essentially an aspect ofdeath. It is the process by which the material nature and the substantial formprepares itself for separation from the soul.It must be borne in mind however that where there is illness or discomfort ordisease which is not related to the final dissolution, the causes thereof are tobe found in many factors; they can be found in the surroundings, for a number ofdiseases are environmental and epidemic; in the tuning in of the individual tostreams of poison emanating from world hate, or from psychological complexeswith some of which we have already dealt, and in the diseases [112] (if I mightso call them) which are indigenous to the matter of which humanity has chosen toconstruct its physical vehicle, isolating it and separating it from the generalsubstance of manifestation, and thus creating a type of matter which isconsecrated to the task of forming the outer expression of the inward reality.This constitutes, therefore, a unique and peculiar aspect of the universalsubstance, perfected to a certain point in the last solar system and of anecessarily higher order than the substance which vibrates creatively to thecall of the three subhuman kingdoms in nature.The Causes of Disease SummarisedIn every occult consideration of disease it must be accepted as a basicproposition that all disease is a result of the misuse of force in some earlierlife or in this. This is fundamental. In connection with this I would remind youof some statements I have earlier made on this matter.1. Ninety per cent of the causes of disease are to be found in the etheric andastral bodies. Wrong use of mental energy and misapplied desire are paramountfactors, yet with the bulk of humanity still in the Atlantean stages ofconsciousness, only five per cent of the prevalent diseases are due to mentalcauses. The percentage varies with the development of the race and itsevolution. Disease is therefore the working out into manifestation ofundesirable, subjective conditions—vital, emotional and mental.2. Everything concerning the health of man can be approached from three angles:a. That of the personality life...of this we are learning much. [113]b. That of humanity as a whole..this is beginning to be appreciated.c. That of the planetary life....of this we can know little.3. All disease is caused by lack of harmony between form and life, between souland personality; this lack of harmony runs through all the kingdoms in nature.4. The bulk of diseases are of:a. Group origin.b. The result of infection.c. Malnutrition, physically, subjectively and occultly understood.5. Diseases for the masses, for the average citizen, for the intelligentsia andfor disciples differ widely and have differing fields of expression.a. The three major groups of diseases for the first two classes are:Tuberculosis.The social diseases.Cancer.b. The two major diseases for the intelligentsia and for disciples are:Heart complaints.Nervous diseases.6. Disease is a fact in nature. When this is accepted, men will begin to workwith the Law of Liberation, with right thought, leading to right attitudes andorientation, and with the principle of nonresistance. Of this nonresistance, theoverpowering willingness to die which is so frequently a characteristic of thefinal stage immediately preceding death is the lowest manifestation. It isnonresistance which psychologically governs coma. [114]7. The Law of Cause and Effect, or of Karma, governs all disease. This embracesindividual, group, national and total human karma.If you will pause at this point and review what I have re-stated, and if youwill reread and reflect upon the four Laws and the four Rules you will possessthe needed groundwork upon which to proceed with our future studies, beginningwith the diseases incident to the life of discipleship. Some of this I havealready dealt with in the second volume of A Treatise on the Seven Rays (pages520-625). There the approach was largely from the angle of the mystic, whereas Iam here going to touch upon the problems of the accepted disciple.4. DISEASES DUE TO THE LIFE OF DISCIPLESHIPEarlier I told you that disease originated in the four following causes:1. It is the result of blocking the free life of the soul.2. It is caused by three influences or sources of contamination:a. Ancient mistakes, so-called sins and errors of the individual concerned,committed in this life or another earlier incarnation.b. Human taints and predispositions, inherited in common with all the rest ofhumanity.c. Planetary evil, incident to the point achieved by the planetary Logos andconditioned by planetary Karma.3. It is conditioned by the forces emanating from the plane upon which the man’sconsciousness is primarily focussed. [115]4. The five major types of disease, with their allied and subsidiary effects,can and do produce results where the disciple is concerned; he is not immuneuntil after the third initiation.A. The Diseases of Mystics.However, the disciple is seldom tubercular (except when karmically conditioned),nor is he prone to succumb to the social diseases except as they may affect himphysically through his sacrificial life of service. Contagion can affect him butnot seriously so. Cancer may claim him as a victim, but he is more liable tosuccumb to heart complaints and to nervous trouble of some kind or another. Thestraight mystic succumbs more to purely psychological situations connected withthe integrated personality, and therefore incident to his being focussed largelyon the astral plane. The disciple is more prone to mental difficulties and tothose complaints which are concerned with energy and are due to fusion—eithercompleted or in process—of soul and personality.The first cause which I listed earlier in this treatise was summed up in thestatement that disease is the result of the blocking of the free life and theinpouring energy of the soul. This blockage is brought about by the mystic whenhe succumbs to his own thoughtforms, created constantly in response to hismounting aspiration. These become barriers between him and the free life of thesoul and block his contact and the consequent resulting inflow of soul energy.The disciple reverses the entire situation and falls a victim (prior to thethird initiation) to the terrific inflow of soul energy—the energy of the secondaspect—coming to him from: [116]a. His own soul, with which centre of energy fusion is rapidly taking place.b. His group or the Ashram with which he, as an accepted disciple, isaffiliated.c. His Master, with Whom he has spiritual relation and to Whose vibratoryinfluence he is ever susceptible.d. The Hierarchy, the energy of which can reach him through the medium of allthe three above factors.All these streams of energy have a definite effect upon the centres of thedisciple, according to his ray and his specific polarisation in thisincarnation. As each centre is related to one or other of the glands, and thesein their turn condition the blood stream, and also have a specific effect uponthe organic structure within the range of their vibratory influence (i.e. thestomach, close to the solar plexus, and the heart, close to the heart centre,etc.), you will see how it is possible that the major diseases from which adisciple can suffer (which are unique and confined primarily to advancedhumanity) will be the result of overstimulation or the inflow of energy to oneparticular centre, producing excessive and localised trouble.To these conditions the mystic is not so prone unless he is rapidly becoming thepractical mystic or occultist. This is a definite transitional cycle between themystical attitude and that more definite position which the occultist assumes. Ishall not therefore deal with the diseases to which mystics fall heir, exceptthat I would like to point out one interesting fact: The mystic is everconscious of duality. He is the seeker in search of light, of the soul, of thebeloved, of that higher something which he senses as existing and as that whichcan be found. He strives after recognition of and by the divine: he is thefollower of the [117] vision, a disciple of the Christ, and this conditions histhinking and his aspiration. He is a devotee and one who loves the apparentlyunattainable—the Other than himself.Only when he becomes the occultist does the mystic learn that all the time themagnet which attracted him, and the dualism which coloured his life and thoughtsand which gave motive to all he sought to do, was his true self, that oneReality. He recognises then that assimilation into and identification with thatone reality enables duality to be transmuted into unity and the sense of searchto be transformed into the effort to become what he essentially is—a Son of God,one with all Sons of God. Having accomplished that, he finds himself one withthe ONE in Whom we live and move and have our being.Next, I would point out that the lowest expression of the mystical condition,and one with which we are becoming increasingly familiar, is that which iscalled a “split personality”; when this condition is present, the personal lowerself expresses itself through a basic condition of duality and two personsexpress themselves, apparently, instead of the integrated personality-soul. Thisnecessarily creates a dangerous psychological condition and one which warrantstrained scientific handling. That is largely lacking at this time, as so fewtrained psychologists and psychiatrists recognise the fact of the soul. Imention this as it is of value today, and will be increasingly so in the lateryears when it will be necessary to trace and comprehend the analogies existingin the human consciousness to great unexplored areas of awareness. The splitpersonality and the mystic are two aspects of one whole—the aspect which isright, and along the line of high spiritual unfoldment, and the aspect which isa reflection and a distortion of that grade of development which precedes thatof trained occultist. There are many conditions prevalent in humanity [118] atthis time which can be subjected to the same reasoning, and one of the modes ofhealing which will be worked out later is the discovery of the highercorrespondences to the lower difficulties and diseases, and the recognition thatthey are but distortions of a great reality. This leads to the transference ofthe attention of the one under the care of the healer to that recognised higheraspect.The whole Science of Integration is involved in this matter. This science, ifproperly understood, will open up an entirely new field of psychologicalapproach to disease, whether physiological or nervous. A small beginning hasalready been made along this line by spiritually minded psychologists andeducators. The system of helping people psychologically is definitely alongthese new lines, and might be expressed as follows: the average psychologistemploys the method (when dealing with nervous cases, with those on theborderland, and with neurotically inclined people) of discovering thedeep-seated complexes, the scars, the ancient shocks or the fears which liebehind the experience of the present and which have made the man what he istoday. These conditioning factors can usually be traced back to the subconsciousby the process of unearthing the past, of taking into consideration the presentenvironment, of reckoning with heredity, and of studying the effects ofeducation—either academic or based upon life itself. Then the factor which hasbeen a major handicap, and which has turned the man into a psychologicalproblem, is brought (with his assistance, if possible) to the surface of hisconsciousness, is then intelligently explained and related to the existingcondition, and the man is consequently brought to an understanding of hispersonality, its problems and its impending opportunity.The spiritual technique, however, is entirely different. The personality problemand the process of delving into [119] the subconscious are ignored, because theconditions which are undesirable are regarded as the result of lack of soulcontact and of soul control. The patient (if I might so call him) is taught totake his eyes, and consequently his attention, away from himself, his feelings,his complexes and his fixed ideas and undesirable thoughts, and to focus themupon the soul, the divine Reality within the form, and the Christ consciousness.This could well be called the process of scientific substitution of a freshdynamic interest for that which has hitherto held the stage; it brings intofunctioning activity a cooperative factor whose energy sweeps through the lowerlife of the personality and carries away wrong psychological tendencies,undesirable complexes, leading to erroneous approaches to life. This eventuallyregenerates the mental or thought life, so that the man is conditioned by rightthinking under the impulse or the illumination of the soul. This produces the“dynamic expulsive power of a new affection”; the old idées fixes , the olddepressions and miseries, the hindering and handicapping ancient desires—theseall disappear, and the man stands free as a soul and master of his lifeprocesses.I have discussed these two conditions at length because it is essential thatanother law anent healing be understood before we proceed any further. Thediscussion about the split personality, the problems of the mystic and the newmode of approach to disease (from the soul angle and the realm of causes,instead of from the personality angle and the realm of effects) can clarify thislaw in your minds and indicate at least its reasonableness and its valuableapplication to human need.LAW IVDisease, both physical and psychological, has its roots in the good, thebeautiful and the true. It is but a distorted [120] refection of divinepossibilities. The thwarted soul, seeking full expression of some divinecharacteristic or inner spiritual reality, produces within the substance of itssheaths a point of friction. Upon this point the eyes of the personality arefocussed, and this leads to disease.The art of the healer is concerned with the lifting of the downward focussedeyes unto the soul, the Healer within the form. The spiritual or third eye thendirects the healing force, and all is well.B. Diseases of Disciples.We will divide what we have to say anent the diseases of disciples into twoparts: the specific problems of all disciples, and the difficulties incident tosoul contact.We need here to remember that all disciples are susceptible to the majorcategories of disease. They are attempting to be one with all humanity, and thisincludes, therefore, all the ills to which flesh is heir. They may not, however,succumb to the frailties of the ordinary man, and should remember that diseasesof the heart and of the nerves constitute their major problem. In thisconnection it might be pointed out that the disciples are found in two majorgroups: Those who live above the diaphragm and who are, therefore, prone toheart diseases, to thyroid and throat troubles, and those who are in process oftransferring the energies of the centres below the diaphragm into the centresabove the diaphragm. Most of these at this time are transferring solar plexusenergies into the heart, and the world agony is profoundly hastening theprocess. Stomachic, liver and respiratory troubles accompany this transference.1. The Specific Problems of Disciples.These special problems are, as you know, peculiar to those who have liftedthemselves in consciousness out of the life of the personality into that of thesoul. They [121] are primarily related to energy, its inflow, its assimilationor non-assimilation, and its rightly directed use. The other ills to which allflesh is heir at this time in human evolution (for it must be remembered thatdiseases vary according to the point in evolution and are also cyclic in theirappearance), and to which disciples can and do succumb, are not dealt with here;suffice it to say that the three major diseases of humanity to which referencehas been made take their toll of disciples, particularly in bringing about theliberation of the soul from its vehicle. They are, however—little as it mayappear—controlled in these cases from soul levels, and the departure is plannedto take place as a result of soul decision, and not as a result of theefficiency of the disease. The reason that these three major diseases,indigenous to the planetary life in which we live and move and have our being,have this power over disciples is that disciples are themselves an integral partof the planetary life, and in the earlier stages of their recognition of thisunity they are prone to fall a ready prey to the disease. This is a fact littleknown or realised, but explains why disciples and advanced people aresusceptible to these diseases.We could divide these problems into four categories:1. Those which are connected with the blood or with the life aspect, for “theblood is the life.” These have specific effect upon the heart, but usually of afunctional nature only. Organic disease of the heart arises in more deeplyseated causes.2. Those which are a direct effect of energy, playing upon and through thenervous system, via the directing brain.3. Those which are related to the respiratory system and have an occult source.4. Those which are specifically due to the receptivity or the non-receptivity,to the functioning or the non-functioning, [122] and to the influence of thecentre. Necessarily, these fall into seven groups, affecting seven major areasof the body. For the average disciple, before there is complete soul control andmonadic direction, the major directing agent, via the brain, is the vagus nerve,along which the energies (entering via the head centre) are distributed to therest of the body. A definite science of the centres and their relation tokundalini has been built up by a certain powerful esoteric school in the orient.It has in it much truth, but also much error.I have differentiated between problems and physical reactions and diseasebecause the inflow, distribution and direction of energy do not necessarilyproduce disease. Always, however, during the novitiate which precedes all theinitiations, they do produce difficulties and problems of some kind or another,either within the consciousness of the disciple or in his relation to thosearound him. Hence his environment is affected, and consequently his ownreciprocal action.It should be remembered in this connection that all disciples are energy centresin the body of humanity and are in process of becoming points of focussed,directed energy. Their function and activity always and inevitably produceeffects, results, awakenings, disruptions and reorientations in the lives ofthose around them. In the early stages, they produce this unconsciously, andhence frequently the results on those they contact is not desirable, nor is theenergy wisely directed, deflected or retained. Intelligent intent must liebehind all wise direction of energy. Later, when they are learning consciouslyto be and are becoming radiatory centres of healing force, consciously directed,this informing and then transmitted energy is more constructively employed alongboth psychological and physical lines. Nevertheless, in any case, the disciplebecomes [123] an effective influence and can never be what is esotericallycalled “unnoticed in his place and minus impact on other souls.” His influence,emanation and forceful energy inevitably produce problems and difficulties forhim; these are based on the human relations which he has karmically establishedand the reactions of those he contacts, either for good or for ill.Essentially the influence of a disciple of the Great White Lodge isfundamentally good and spiritually conditioning; superficially and in its outereffects—particularly where the disciple is concerned—difficult situations,apparent cleavages and the emergence of faults as well as virtues upon the partof those affected make their appearance, and often persist for many lives, untilthe person thus influenced becomes what is called “occultly reconciled to theemanating energy.” Ponder on this. The adjustment has to come from the side ofthose influenced, and not from the disciple.Let us now consider the four problems from the psychological angle, not thephysical:a. The problems arising from the awakened heart centre of the disciple areperhaps the commonest and frequently some of the most difficult to handle. Theseproblems are based on living relationships and the interplay of the energy oflove with the forces of desire. In the early stages, this inflowing love-forceestablishes personality contacts which veer between the stages of wild devotionand utmost hate on the part of the person affected by the disciple’s energy.This produces constant turmoil in the disciple’s life, until he has becomeadjusted to the effects of his energy distribution, and also frequent disruptionof relationships and frequent reconciliations. When the disciple is ofsufficient importance to become the organising centre of a group, or is in aposition to begin to form, esoterically, his own ashram (prior to taking some ofthe major initiations), [124] then the difficulty can be very real and mostdisturbing. There is, however, little that can be done by the disciple, exceptto attempt to regulate the outgoing energy of love. The problem remainsfundamentally that of the one affected; the adjustments, as I have remarkedabove, have to be made from the other side, with the disciple standing ready tocooperate at the first indication of a willingness to recognise relationship andintention to cooperate in group service. This is a point which both parties—thedisciple and the person reacting to his influence—need to consider. The disciplestands ready; the responsive party usually withdraws or approaches according tothe urge of his soul or of his personality—probably the latter in the earlystages. Eventually, however, he stands with the disciple in full cooperativeunderstanding, and the trying time of difficulty is ended.It is not possible for me to enter into explicit detail in considering theseproblems connected with the heart and the life energy of the disciple. They areconditioned by his ray, the initiation for which he is being prepared, and thequality, evolutionary status and the ray of those affected.There are also difficulties and problems of a more subtle nature arising fromthe same cause, but not localised in certain definite human relationships. Adisciple serves; he writes and speaks; his words and influence permeate into themasses of men, arousing them to activity of some kind—often good and spiritual,sometimes evil, antagonistic and dangerous. He has therefore to deal not onlywith his own reactions to the work he is doing, but also, in a general andspecific sense, to deal with the masses whom he is beginning to affect. This isnot an easy thing to do, particularly for an inexperienced worker with the Plan.He fluctuates between the mental plane, where he normally [125] attempts tofunction, and the astral plane, where the masses of men are focussed, and thisbrings him into the realm of glamour and consequent danger. He goes out inconsciousness towards those he seeks to help, but it is sometimes as a soul (andthen he frequently overstimulates his hearers), and sometimes as a personality(and then he feeds and enhances their personality reactions).As time goes on he learns—through the difficulties brought about by thenecessary heart approach—to stand firm at the centre, sending forth the note,giving his message, distributing directed love energy, and influencing thosearound him, but he remains impersonal, a directing agency only and anunderstanding soul. This impersonality (which can be defined as a withdrawing ofpersonality energy) produces its own problems, as all disciples well know; thereis nothing, however, that they can do about it but wait for time to lead theother person forward into clear understanding of the significance and esotericmeaning of right human relations. The problem of workers with individuals andwith groups is basically connected with the energy of the heart and with thevivifying force of its embodied life. In connection with this problem and itsreactions upon the disciple, certain definite physical difficulties are apt tooccur, and with these I will shortly deal.It should also be pointed out that difficulties of rhythm are apt to occur, andproblems connected with the cyclic life of the disciple. The heart and the bloodare esoterically related, and symbolically define the pulsating life of the soulwhich demonstrates upon the physical plane in the outgoing and the withdrawingdual life of discipleship, each phase of which presents its own problems. Once adisciple has mastered the rhythm of his outer and inner life, and has organisedhis reactions so that he extracts the utmost meaning from them but is notconditioned by them, he then [126] enters upon the relatively simple life of theinitiate. Does that phrase astonish you? You need to remember that the initiatehas freed himself, after the second initiation, from the complexities ofemotional and astral control. Glamour can no longer overpower him. He can standwith steadfastness in spite of all that he may do and feel. He realises that thecyclic condition is related to the pairs of opposites and is part of the lifemanifestation of existence itself. In the process of learning this, he passesthrough great difficulties. He, as a soul, subjects himself to a life ofoutgoing, of magnetic influence and of extroversion. He may follow thisimmediately with a life of withdrawal, of apparent lack of interest in hisrelationships and environment, and with an intense introspective, introvertedexpression. Between these two extremes he may flounder distressingly—sometimesfor many lives—until he learns to fuse and blend the two expressions. Then thedual life of the accepted disciple, in its various grades and stages, becomesclear to him; he knows what he is doing. Constantly and systematically, bothoutgoing and withdrawing, serving in the world and living the life ofreflection, play their useful part.Many psychological difficulties arise whilst this process is being mastered,leading to psychological cleavages, both deep-seated and superficial. The goalof all development is integration—integration as a personality, integration withthe soul, integration into the Hierarchy, integration with the Whole, untilcomplete unity and identification has been achieved. In order to master thisscience of integration whose basic goal is identity with the One Reality, thedisciple progresses from one unification to another, making mistakes, arrivingoften at complete discouragement, identifying himself with that which isundesirable until, as soul-personality, he repudiates the earlier relationships;he pays [127] the penalty again and again of misplaced fervour, distortedaspiration, the overpowering effect of glamour, and the many conditions ofpsychological and physical disarrangement which must arise whilst cleavages arebeing healed, right identification achieved and correct orientation established.Whilst this basic, inescapable and necessary process is taking place, a definitework is going forward in the etheric body. The disciple is learning to lift theenergies, gathered from the lower centres, into the solar plexus and from thatcentre into the heart centre, thus bringing about a re-focussing of the energiesabove the diaphragm instead of putting the emphasis below. This leads frequentlyto profound complications, because—from the personality angle—the solar plexuscentre is the most potent, being the clearing house for the personality forces.It is that process of decentralisation and “elevation” of the lowerconsciousness to the higher which produces the main difficulties to which thedisciple is subjected. It is this process also which is going on in the world asa whole today, causing the appalling disruption of human affairs, culture, andcivilisation. The entire focus of humanity’s consciousness is being changed; theselfish life (characteristic of the man centred in his desires and consequentlyin the solar plexus centre) is giving place to the decentralised life of the manwho is unselfish (centred in the Self or soul), aware of his relationships andresponsibility to the Whole and not to the part. This sublimation of the lowerlife into the higher is one of deepest moment to the individual and to the race.Once the individual disciple, and humanity as well, symbolising the worlddisciple, have mastered the process of transference in this respect, we shallsee the new order of individual service and of world service established, andtherefore the coming in of the awaited new order.[128] Of all these processes, the circulation of the blood stream is the symbol,and the clue to the establishment of the world order lies hid in thissymbology—free circulation of all that is needed to all parts of the greatframework of humanity. The blood is the life, and free interchange, freesharing, free circulation of all that is required for right human living willcharacterise the world to be. Today these conditions do not exist, the body ofhumanity is diseased and its internal life disrupted. Instead of freecirculation between all parts of the life aspect, there has been separation,blocked channels, congestion and stagnation. It has needed the terrific crisisof the present to arouse humanity to its diseased condition, to the extent ofthe evil which is now discovered to be so great, and the diseases of the “bloodof humanity” (symbolically understood) so severe that only the most drasticmeasures—pain, agony, despair and terror—can suffice to establish a cure.Healers would do well to remember this, and to have in mind that disciples andall good men and aspirants share in this universal disease of humanity whichmust take its toll psychologically or physically or both. The trouble is ofancient origin and of long established habit and inevitably affects the physicalvehicle of the soul. Exemption from the effects of human ills is no indicationof spiritual superiority. It might simply indicate what one of the Masters hascalled “the depths of spiritual selfishness and self-satisfaction.” The initiateof the third degree can hold himself exempt, but this is only because he hascompletely freed himself from glamour and no aspect of the personality life hasany further power over him. All the ray types are equally subjected to theseparticular problems. The seventh ray, however, is more susceptible to theproblems, difficulties and diseases incident to the blood stream than are any ofthe other ray types. The reason is that this is the ray which has [129] to dowith the expression and manifestation of life upon the physical plane and withthe organisation of the relationship between spirit and matter into form. It isconcerned therefore today, as it seeks to create the new order, with freecirculation and with a consequently intended freedom of humanity from the illsand problems of the past. This is of interest to remember, and students wouldfind it helpful at this time, if they want to cooperate intelligently with thehappenings of the day, to collect and study all that I have written about theseventh ray of ceremonial order and magic.b. Diseases of the nervous system , due to the flow of energy to all parts ofthe body, directed by either the personality, some aspect of the personal lowerself, or by the soul, via the brain, are many and become acute as the disciplenears initiation or becomes an initiate. Apart from the physiological ills whichthis produces, there are many other conditions brought about by this inflow offorce. The disciple becomes, for instance, overstimulated, and thereforeoveractive; he becomes unbalanced, and when I say this I do not refer to mentalimbalance (though that can happen), but to overdevelopment and overexpression insome part of his nature. He can become extravagantly overorganised through themedium of some overactive centre, or underorganised and inactive. He istherefore subject to the imbalance of the glandular system, with all itsattendant difficulties. His overstimulation or his undevelopment, where thecentres are concerned, normally affects the glands, and they in their turnproduce character difficulties which necessarily, in their turn, produceenvironmental problems as well as personality handicaps.It is then a vicious circle, and is all due to wrong direction of force and theinflow of force from one or other of the [130] personality vehicles to itsrelated centre (i.e., the astral force and its relation to the solar plexus),and then the appearance of the problems of health, of character and ofinfluence. Over-radiatory activity, through the medium of some centre, attractsattention and the disciple becomes the victim of his own achievement. I shalldeal with these at greater length when I take up the diseases which develop fromthe four categories.These difficulties are of a most general kind but do affect primarily second andsixth ray disciples. The one because the second ray is the building ray, and istherefore concerned predominantly with outer manifestation and with theutilisation of all the centres, and the other because it is primarily the ray oftension—a tension which can work out in the form of the most evil fanaticism orthe most altruistic devotion. All the rays present the same problems, needlessto say, but the second ray deals largely with the soul’s activity through allthe centres (those above and those below the diaphragm) but with the heart asthe prime centre of attention. The sixth ray has a close relation to the solarplexus centre as the clearing house and the place of reorientation of the lifeforce in the personality. Bear this constantly in mind.c. The problems connected with the respiratory or breathing system are allrelated to the heart, and therefore concerned with the establishing of rightrhythm and right contact with the environment. The drawing in of the lifebreath, the sharing of the air with all other human beings, denotes both anindividual centre of life and participation also in the general life of all. Tothese problems of individual or separative existence and of its opposite, theSacred Word, the OM, is intimately related. It might be said [131] in the wordsof an occult manual on healing, given to advanced disciples, that“He who lives under the sound of the AUM knows himself. He who lives soundingthe OM knows his brother. He who knows the SOUND knows all.”Then, in the cryptic and symbolic language of the initiate, the manual goes on:“The breath of life becomes the cause of death to the one who lives within ashell. He exists but he is not; the breath then leaves and spirals to the whole.“He who breathes forth the OM knows not himself alone. He knows the breath isprana, life, the fluid of connection. The ills of life are his because they arethe lot of man—not generated in a shell, because the shell is not.“He who is the SOUND and sounding forth knows not disease, knows not the hand ofdeath.”In these few words the whole problem of the third group of problems and diseasesis summed up. They are concerned with the circulation of soul energy, which isthe energy of love, and they are not concerned with the circulation of the lifeessence. These two basic energies, as they play upon the forces of thepersonality, bring about the bulk of the problems to which humanity falls heir.These are lack of love, lack of life, failure to sound forth correctly the noteof the soul and of the ray, and failure to transmit. The secret of constitutinga pure channel (to use mystic but not occult phraseology), is considered in thefirst group of problems; and the establishing of right relation by rightsounding forth of the attractive note of the soul, is considered in the last twogroups.[132] This third group of difficulties, problems and diseases are of coursethose of people upon all the rays, but first ray people have a definitepredisposition to these specific troubles. At the same time, when they rightlyutilise their latent powers, they can overcome by the right use of the OM, andfinally of the SOUND, the incidental problems and difficulties far more easilythan those on other rays. You have here a reference to the Lost Word of Masonryand to the SOUND of the Ineffable Name.The sound of the AUM, the sound of the OM, and the SOUND itself, are all relatedto vibration and its differing and varied effects. The secret of the Law ofVibration is progressively revealed as people learn to sound forth the WORD inits three aspects. Students would do well to ponder on the distinction betweenthe breath and the sound, between the process of breathing and the process ofcreating vibratory activity. They are related but distinct from each other. Oneis related to Time and the other to Space and (as the Old Commentary puts it)“the sound, the final and yet initiating sound, concerns that which is neitherTime nor Space; it lies outside the manifested All, the Source of all that isand yet is naught” (or no-thing. A.A.B.).For this reason, disciples on the fourth ray usually can develop by the power ofthe intuition an understanding of the OM. This ray of harmony through conflict(the conflict of the pairs of opposites) is necessarily concerned with thebringing in of that vibratory activity which will lead to unity, to harmony andto right relations, and to the release of the intuition.d. The problems incident to the activity of inactivity of the centres areperhaps the most important from the standpoint of disease, because the centresgovern the glandular [133] system and the glands have a direct relation to theblood stream and they condition also the major and most important areas in thehuman body; they have both a physiological and a psychological effect upon thepersonality and its interior and exterior contacts and relations. The reactionis primarily physical but the effects are largely psychological, and it istherefore this fourth group upon which I shall principally enlarge, dealing withthe diseases of disciples and giving some definite instructions upon thecentres. This will indicate more clearly than elsewhere the causes of the manyhuman ills and physical difficulties.Before proceeding to our next point, try to grasp somewhat more fully the Lawsof Healing and the Rules given thus far and repeated here to facilitate yourendeavours.LAW IAll disease is the result of inhibited soul life and this is true of all formsin all kingdoms. The art of the healer consists in releasing the soul so thatits life can flow through the aggregate of organisms which constitute anyparticular form.LAW IIDisease is the product of, and subject to, three influences: first, a man’spast, wherein he pays the price of ancient error; second, his inheritance,wherein he shares with all mankind those tainted streams of energy which are ofgroup origin; third, he shares with all the natural forms that which the Lord ofLife imposes on His body. These three influences are called “The Ancient Law ofEvil Sharing.” This must give place some day to that new “Law of AncientDominating Good” which lies behind all that God made. This law must be broughtinto activity by the spiritual will of man.LAW IIIDiseases are an effect of the basic centralisation of a man’s life energy. Fromthe plane whereon those energies [134] are focussed, proceed those determiningconditions which produce ill health, and which, therefore, work out as diseaseor as freedom from disease.LAW IVDisease, both physical and psychological, has its roots in the good, thebeautiful and the true. It is but a distorted reflection of divinepossibilities. The thwarted soul, seeking full expression of some divinecharacteristic or inner spiritual reality, produces within the substance of itssheaths a point of friction. Upon this point the eyes of the personality arefocussed, and this leads to disease. The art of the healer is concerned with thelifting of the downward focussed eyes unto the soul, the Healer within the form.The spiritual or third eye then directs the healing force, and all is well.RULE ONEThe healer must seek to link his soul, his heart, his brain and his hands. Thuscan he pour the vital healing force upon the patient. This is magnetic work . Itcures disease, or increases the evil state, according to the knowledge of thehealer.The healer must seek to link his soul, his brain, his heart and auric emanation.Thus can his presence feed the soul life of the patient. This is the work ofradiation . The hands are needed not. The soul displays its power. The patient’ssoul responds through the response of his aura to the radiation of the healer’saura, flooded with soul energy.RULE TWOThe healer must achieve magnetic purity, through purity of life. He must attainthat dispelling radiance which shows itself in every man when he links thecentres in the head. When this magnetic field is established, the radiation toogoes forth.RULE THREELet the healer train himself to know the inner stage of thought or of desire ofthe one who seeks his help. He [135] can thereby know the source from which thetrouble comes. Let him relate the cause and the effect, and know the point exactthrough which the help must come.RULE FOURThe healer and the healing group must keep the will in leash. It is not willthat must be used but love.2. Difficulties Incident to Soul Contact.Today we begin a study of the difficulties, the diseases and the psychologicaltroubles (neurological and mental) of the aspirants and of the disciples of theworld. These we shall study definitely from the angle of the seven centres, aswell as considering the results of the forces and energies (I use thesedistinctive words advisedly) which pour through them. Much that I shall say willbe open to question from the viewpoint of orthodox medicine, yet, at the sametime, orthodox medicine has been steadily drifting towards the occult point ofview. I shall not attempt to relate the esoteric attitude of healing, itspropositions and methods, to the modern schools of therapy. The two aregradually approaching each other, in any case. The lay reader, for whom theseteachings are intended, will get a clearer comprehension of my thesis if it iskept relatively free from the technical terms and the academic attitudes of themedical sciences. They would but serve to confuse, and my effort is to give ageneral picture of the underlying causes of outer physical ills. I seek topresent certain aspects of occult therapy for which mankind is now ready,reminding you that the presentation is naturally inadequate and partial, and forthat reason may appear incorrect and to be challenging to those who look everfor outlets for human credulity. That, however, concerns me not. Time will provethe accuracy of my statements.[136] The new medicine will deal with factors which are dimly recognised atpresent and which are not, as yet, brought into any real or factual relationshipto man and his body. The basic theory upon which the new medical teaching willrest can best be summed up in the statement that there is in reality nothing butenergy to be considered, and the forces which are resistant to or assimilativeof higher or different types of energy. Let me therefore start by giving you anew Law to add to the four already communicated. The previous Laws have been inthe nature of abstract propositions, and unless related to this fifth Law willremain somewhat vague and meaningless.LAW VThere is naught but energy, for God is life. Two energies meet in man, but otherfive are present. For each is to be found a central point of contact. Theconflict of these energies with forces and of the forces twixt themselvesproduce the bodily ills of man. The conflict of the first and second persistsfor ages until the mountain top is reached—the first great mountain top. Thefight between the forces produces all disease, all ills and bodily pain, whichseek release in death. The two, the five, and thus the seven, plus that whichthey produce, possess the secret. This is the fifth Law of Healing within theworld of form.This Law can be resolved into certain basic statements which can be tabulated asfollows:1. We live in a world of energies and are a constituent part of them ourselves.2. The physical vehicle is a fusion of two energies and seven forces.3. The first energy is that of the soul, the ray energy. It is the producer ofconflict as the soul energy seeks to control the forces.[137] 4. The second energy is that of the threefold personality—the personalityray as it is resistant to the higher energy.5. The forces are the other energies or ray potencies which control the sevencentres and are dominated either by the energy of the personality or by that ofthe soul.6. Two conflicts, therefore, proceed between the two major energies and betweenthe other energies, focussed through the seven centres.7. It is the interplay of these energies which produces good health or bad.There has been much teaching given anent the age-long struggle betweenpersonality and soul, but it has always been presented in the language ofspiritual approach, of mysticism and of religion, or else in terms of characterreaction, of abstract aspiration and of purity or non-purity. With these I shallnot deal. My theme is the effects of this conflict in the physical body. I wish,therefore, to confine myself only to the physiological and psychologicalproblems incident to the struggle which, in the main, make hard the lot of thedisciple. It might be posited that:A. All diseases and physical difficulties are caused by one or more of threethings or conditions:1. A developed soul contact, thus producing the vitalisation of all the centresin ordered rhythm, according to the soul ray. This necessarily produces stressand strain in the physical vehicle.2. Personality life and focus, which attempts to negate this soul control, andwhich is largely expressed through the activity of the throat centre(predisposing an activity of the thyroid gland) and of the centres below thediaphragm.[138] 3. A cycle in the life of the aspirant wherein personality control beginsto weaken and in which the emphasis and consequent activity shifts into thecentres above the diaphragm—again causing trouble and readjustment.B. Certain objectives present themselves to the aspirant at various stages, andeach involves progress, but at the same time certain attendant difficulties.1. The objective before the initiate is to have every centre in the etheric bodyresponsive to the ray energy of the soul and with all the other seven rayenergies subsidiary to it. This process of stimulation, of readjustment, and theattainment of established control goes on until after the third initiation.Then, when that initiation has been taken, the physical vehicle is of a totallydifferent calibre and quality, and the Rules and Laws of Health no longer apply.2. The objective before the disciple is to promote control of the centres in thebody, via the soul, through stimulation, elimination and eventual stabilisation.This inevitably produces difficulty, and the vitalisation or inspiration (eitherof these words would be appropriate), or their lack or deficiency, affect thebodily organs within the areas around the centres and affect all substancessurrounding the centres.3. The objective before the aspirant or the probationary disciple is to transferthe forces from the centres below the diaphragm, via the solar plexus centre, tothe centres above the diaphragm. The energy of the base of the spine has to betransferred to the head; the energy of the sacral centre must be lifted to thethroat, whilst the energy of the solar plexus must be transferred to the heart.This is done in response to the magnetic “pull” of the soul ray as it begins todominate the personality ray. It is a long and painful [139] process, coveringmany lives and carrying, as the result, many physical ills.4. The objective before the average man (unconsciously effective) is to respondfully to personality force, focussed primarily at the middle point, the solarplexus, and then steadily and intelligently to coordinate these forces so thatan integrated personality is presented eventually to the soul for control anduse.5. The objective before the primitive or undeveloped man (again unconsciouslyeffective) is to live a full animal and emotional life, thereby gainingexperience of growth, of contact, and eventually of understanding. By this meansthe response apparatus of the soul in the three worlds is built.I would also call attention to the thought which I have here interjected, thatthe objectives intrinsically in themselves have an effect upon that towardswhich man is striving. This is a thought warranting careful consideration.These generalisations will be useful only if you remember that they aregeneralisations. No aspirant at any stage is perfectly clear cut in hisendeavour until after the third initiation, nor is he entirely particularised inhis life and effort. Men are at all imaginable stages of development, and manyof these stages are intermediate to the five stages above mentioned. These allmerge and blend into each other, and often constitute a formidable and confusingarena for thought and activity. It is only in the life of the undevelopedindividual that clear simplicity is to be found. In between—from the stage ofinfancy of the race or of the man to that of the state of liberation frompersonality life—there is nothing but complexity, the overlapping of states ofconsciousness, difficulty, disease, psychological problems, illness and death.[140] This must obviously be so when the vast number of energies and forceswhich constitute man’s being and form his environment are brought into relationwith each other. Every human being is, in reality, like a miniature whirlpool inthat great ocean of Being in which he lives and moves—ceaselessly in motionuntil such time as the soul “breathes upon the waters” (or forces) and the Angelof the Presence descends into the whirlpool. Then all becomes still. The watersstirred by the rhythm of life, and later stirred violently by the descent of theAngel, respond to the Angel’s healing power and are changed “into a quiet poolinto which the little ones can enter and find the healing which they need.” Sosays the Old Commentary.The Centres and the Glandular SystemIt will therefore be apparent to you that disease (when not of a group origin,or the result of planetary karma or based on accident) takes its rise in theactivity or the non-activity of the centres. This is a statement of a basictruth, given in the simplest manner. The centres, as you know, govern theendocrine system which, in its turn, controls the seven major areas of thephysical body and is responsible for the correct functioning of the entireorganism, producing both physiological and psychological effects.The importance of this glandular system cannot be overestimated. It is a replicain miniature of the septenary constitution of the universe and the medium ofexpression and the instrument of contact for the seven ray forces, the sevenSpirits before the Throne of God. Around this at present unrecognised truth themedicine and the healing methods of the future civilisation will be built.The glands constitute a great relating system in the body; they bring all partsof the physical vehicle into relation with each other; they also relate the manto the etheric [141] body—both individual and planetary—and likewise to theblood stream, the carrier of the life principle to all parts of the body. Thereare consequently four major agents of distribution to be found in the physicalbody. They are all complete in themselves, all contributory to both thefunctional and the organic life of the body, all closely interrelated and allproducing both physiological and psychological results according to theirpotency, the response of the centres to the higher inflow, the point inevolution achieved, and the free expression, or the reverse, of the incomingenergies. These four agents of distribution of energy are:1. The etheric vehicle itself. This with its myriads of lines of force and ofenergy, the incoming and the outgoing energies, its responsiveness to energyimpacts coming from the environment as well as from the inner spiritual man andthe subtle bodies, underlies the entire physical body. In it are to be found theseven centres as focal points of reception and of distribution; they are therecipients of seven types of energy, and they distribute these seven energiesthrough the entire little human system.2. The nervous system and its various interlocking directorates. This is arelatively tangible network of energies and forces which are the outerexpression of the inner, vital, dynamic network of the etheric body and themillions of nadis or the prototype of the nerves which underlie the moresubstantial body. These nerves and plexi and their many ramifications are thenegative aspects of the positive energies which condition or are attempting tocondition the man.3. The endocrine system. This is the tangible and exoteric expression of theactivity of the vital body and its seven centres. The seven centres of force areto be found in the same region where the seven major glands are located, and[142] each centre of force provides, according to the esoteric teaching, thepower and the life of the corresponding gland which is, in fact, itsexternalisation.Centres Glands Head centre Pineal gland Centre between eyebrows Pituitary bodyThroat centre Thyroid gland Heart centre Thymus gland Solar plexus centrePancreas Sacral centre The gonads Centre at base of spine Adrenal glandsThese three systems are very closely related to each other and constitute aninterlocking directorate of energies and forces which are essentially vital,galvanic, dynamic and creative. They are basically interdependent, and upon themthe entire interior health of the physical organism depends. They are responsivefirst to one or other of the bodies (emotional or mental), then to theintegrated personality and its ray, and finally to the soul ray as it begins toassume control. They are, in reality, responsible for the production of thephysical body and—after birth—they condition its psychological quality, and thisin its turn produces the developing physical man. They are the agents for thethree divine aspects of all manifestation: life quality appearance.4. The blood stream . This is the carrier of the life principle and of thecombined energies and forces of the three above systems. This will be an idea ofsome novelty to the orthodox. The relationship of the circulatory system of theblood to the nervous system has not been as yet adequately developed in modernmedicine. Much, however, has been done to relate the glandular system to theblood.[143] Only when these four interrelated systems are viewed as one integratedwhole and as the four aspects of one vital circulatory system will the truthemerge. Only as they are acknowledged to be the four major distributing agentsof the combined rays of the individual man will the true nature of materialphenomena be grasped. It might be added here that:1. The etheric vehicle from the circulatory angle, is governed by the Moon, asit veils Vulcan.2. The nervous system is ruled by Venus.3. The endocrine system is governed by Saturn.4. The blood stream is governed by Neptune.These four systems are in reality the manifestation of the four aspects ofmatter in its lowest or purely physical expression. There are other aspects ofexpression of the fundamental substance, but these are the four of greatestimportance.Each of these is essentially dual, and each duality corresponds to the ray ofthe soul or of the personality. Each is therefore both positive and negative;each can be described as a unit of resistant force and of dynamic energy; eachis a combination of certain aspects of matter and substance—the matter being therelatively static aspect, and the substance the relatively fluid orquality-endowing agent. Their interplay, relationship and unified function arean expression of the One Life Principle, and when they have reached a point ofperfected fusion or synthesis or coordinated activity there then appears that“life more abundantly” of which Christ spoke and of which we, as yet, knownothing. The four aspects of matter produce the correspondence also to the fourdivine attributes as well as to the three divine aspects.[144] The analogy of the basic dualism of all manifestation is also preserved,thus making the nine of initiation—the three, the four and the two. Thiscorrespondence to the initiatory process is, however, in the reverse direction,for it is initiation into the creative third aspect, the matter aspect and theworld of intelligent activity. It is not initiation into the second or soulaspect, as is the case with the hierarchical initiations for which the discipleis preparing. It is the initiation of the soul into the experience of physicalincarnation, into physical plane existence, and into the art of functioning as ahuman being. The door into this experience is the “Gate of Cancer.” Initiationinto the kingdom of God is entered through the “Gate of Capricorn.” These fourattributes and the three aspects of matter, plus their dual activity, are thecorrespondence to the four aspects of the personality and the Spiritual Triadand their dual active relationship. In this statement is hidden the key toliberation.The Seven Major CentresIt would be of value here if we consider for a moment the nature of the centresthemselves, summarising somewhat the teaching already given in my other books,and so presenting a clear picture of the energy body which underlies the densephysical vehicle.There are many focal points of force within the body, but we shall deal onlywith the major seven which control in some degree or other all the remaining. Inthat way we shall not be confused. We shall consider the five centres found uponthe spinal column and the two which are found in the head.1. The Head Centre . This is located at the very top of the head. It isfrequently called “the thousand-petalled lotus” or the Brahmarandra. [145]a. It corresponds to the central spiritual sun.b. It is brought into functioning activity after the third initiation and is theorgan for the distribution of monadic energy, of the will aspect of divinity.c. It is related to the triple personality by the antahkarana, which disciplesand initiates are in process of constructing and which reaches its fullusefulness only after the destruction of the causal body at the fourthinitiation.d. It is the Shamballa centre in the physical body and the agent of the Fatheror of the first divine aspect.e. It registers purpose, corresponds to the “electric fire” of the solar system,and is dynamic in quality.f. Its dense physical externalisation is the pineal gland in the head. Thisremains active during infancy and until the will-to-be is sufficientlyestablished so that the incarnating person is firmly anchored in physicalincarnation. In the final stages of divine expression in man it again comes intoactivity and usefulness as the agent for the accomplishment on earth of the willenergy of established Being.g. It is the organ of synthesis because, after the third initiation and prior tothe destruction of the causal body, it gathers into itself the energies of allthe three aspects of manifested life. Where man is concerned, this means theenergies of the Spiritual Triad, of the threefold egoic lotus and of the triplepersonality, thus again making the nine of initiation. The energies thussynchronised and focussed in, around and above [146] the head are of greatbeauty and extensive radiation, plus dynamic effectiveness. They serve to relatethe initiate to all parts of the planetary life, to the Great Council atShamballa, and to the Lord of the World, the final Initiator—via the Buddha andone of the three Buddhas of Activity. The Buddha, in a most peculiar sense,relates the initiate to the second aspect of divinity—that of love—and thereforeto the Hierarchy; the Buddhas of Activity relate him to the third aspect ofdivinity, that of active intelligence. Thus the energy of will, of consciousnessand of creativity meet in him, providing the synthesis of the divine aspects.h. This is the only one of the seven centres which at the time of perfectedliberation retains the position of an inverted lotus, with the stem of the lotus(the antahkarana, in reality) reaching up into “the seventh Heaven,” thuslinking the initiate with the first major planetary centre, Shamballa. All theother centres start by being inverted, with all the petals turned downwardstowards the base of the spine; all, in the process of evolution, graduallyunfold their petals and then slowly turn upwards “towards the summit of therod,” as it is called in the Old Commentary . The above is a piece ofinformation which is of small value, except in so far as it presents a truth,completes a picture, and gives the student a symbolic idea of that which isessentially a distributing agent of the will energy of Deity.2. The Ajna Centre. This is the centre between the eyebrows and is found in theregion of the head just above [147] the two eyes, where it “acts as a screen forthe radiant beauty and the glory of the spiritual man.”a. It corresponds to the physical sun and is the expression of the personality,integrated and functioning—first of all as the disciple, and finally as theinitiate. This is the true persona or mask.b. It achieves this functioning activity fully by the time the third initiationis taken. I would remind you that this initiation is regarded by the Hierarchyas the first major initiation, a fact which I have already communicated. It isthe organ for the distribution of the energy of the third aspect—the energy ofactive intelligence.c. It is related to the personality by the creative thread of life, and istherefore closely connected with the throat centre (the centre of creativeactivity), just as the head centre is related to the centre at the base of thespine. An active interplay, once established between the ajna centre and thethroat centre, produces a creative life and a manifested expression of thedivine idea on the part of the initiate. In the same way, the active interplaybetween the head centre and the centre at the base of the spine produces themanifestation of the divine will or purpose. The forces of the ajna and thethroat centres, when combined, produce the highest manifestation of “fire byfriction,” just as the energies of the head centre and the basic centre producethe individual “electric fire” which, when fully expressing itself, we call thekundalini fire.d. It is the centre through which the fourth Creative Hierarchy on its own planefinds expression, [148] and here also this Hierarchy and fourth kingdom innature, the human family are fused and blended. The head centre relates themonad and the personality. The ajna centre relates the Spiritual Triad (theexpression of the monad in the formless worlds) to the personality. Ponder onthis statement, because you have here—in the symbolism of the head centre,physically considered—the reflection of the spiritual will, atma, and spirituallove, buddhi. Here also comes in the teaching on the place of the eyes in thedevelopment of conscious expression, creatively carrying forward the divinepurpose.The Third Eye . . . . . the head centre . . . . . Will. Atma.The eye of the Father, the Monad. SHAMBALLA.The first aspect of will or power and purpose.Related to the pineal gland.The Right Eye . . . . . the ajna centre . . . . .Love. Buddhi.The eye of the Son, the Soul. HIERARCHY.The second aspect of love-wisdom.Related to the pituitary body.The Left Eye . . . . . the throat centre . . . . . Active Intelligence.The eye of the Mother, the personality. HUMANITY.The third aspect of intelligence.Related to the carotid gland .When these three eyes are functioning and all of them “seeing” simultaneously,you will then have insight into divine purpose (the initiate), intuitive visionof the plan (the disciple), and a spiritual direction of the resulting creativeactivity (the Master).e. The ajna centre registers or focusses the intention to create. It is not theorgan of creation in the [149] same sense that the throat centre is, but itembodies the idea lying behind active creativity, the subsequent act of creationproducing eventually the ideal form for the idea.f. Its dense physical externalisation is the pituitary body: the two lobes ofthis gland correspond to the two multiple petals of the ajna centre. Itexpresses imagination and desire in their two highest forms, and these are thedynamic factors lying behind all creation.g. It is the organ of idealism therefore, and,—curiously enough—it is closelyrelated to the sixth ray, just as the head centre is essentially related to thefirst ray. The sixth is peculiarly linked to the third ray and the third aspectof divinity as well as to the second ray and the second aspect. It fuses,anchors and expresses. This is a fact which I have not hitherto emphasised in myother writings. The ajna centre is the point in the head where the dualisticnature of manifestation in the three worlds is symbolised. It fuses the creativeenergies of the throat and the sublimated energies of desire or the true love ofthe heart.h. This centre, having only two real petals, is not a true lotus in the samesense as are the other centres. Its petals are composed of 96 lesser petals orunits of force (48 + 48 = 96) but these do not assume the flower shape of theother lotuses. They spread out like the wings of an airplane to the right andleft of the head, and are symbolic of the right hand path and the left handpath, of the way of matter and the way of spirit. They constitute symbolically,therefore, the two [150] arms of the Cross upon which the man is crucified—twostreams of energy or light placed athwart the stream of life descending from themonad to the base of the spine and passing through the head.The idea of relativity is one that must ever be held in mind as the studentseeks to comprehend the centres, interiorly related within the etheric body,related at the same time to the subtler bodies, to the states of consciousnesswhich are synonymous to states of being and of expression, to ray energies, toenvironing conditions, to the three periodical vehicles (as H. P. B. calls thepersonality, the threefold soul and the Spiritual Triad), to Shamballa and tothe totality of manifested Lives. The complexity of the subject is extreme, butwhen the disciple or initiate is functioning in the three worlds and the variousenergies of the whole man are “grounded” in the earthbound man, then thesituation becomes clearer. I use the expression “grounded” in its true andcorrect sense, and not as the description of a man who has discarded hisphysical body as the spiritualists use the term. Certain recognitions in timeand space become possible; certain effects can be noted, certain ray influencesappear more dominant than others; certain “patterns of being” appear; anexpression of a spiritual Being at a certain point of conscious experienceemerges into clarity and can then be spiritually diagnosed. Its aspects andattributes, its forces and energies, can be determined at that time and for aparticular created expression of life. This must be borne in mind, and thethoughts of the student must not be permitted to rove too far afield but must beconcentrated upon the appearance of the man (himself or another) and upon theemerging quality. When that student is a disciple or an initiate, he will beable also to study the life aspect.[151] Our study will, however, be somewhat different, for we shall attempt todiscover the diseases and difficulties incident to the energy stimulation or thelack of stimulation of the centres, and so arrive at some of the effects whichthis energy inflow and conflict with forces will produce.3. The Throat Centre . This centre is to be found at the back of the neck,reaching up into the medulla oblongata, thus involving the carotid gland, anddown towards the shoulder blades. It is an exceedingly powerful and welldeveloped centre where average humanity is concerned. It is interesting to notein this connection thata. The throat centre is ruled by Saturn just as the two head centres are ruledrespectively by Uranus (ruling the head centre) and Mercury (ruling the ajnacentre). This is only where the disciple is concerned; the rulership changesafter the third initiation or before the first. These three planets constitute amost interesting triangle of forces and in the following triplicities and theirinevitable inter-relations you have—again only in the case of disciples—a mostamazing picture story or symbol of the ninefold of initiation:1. The head centreThe ajna centreThe throat centre2. The third eyeThe right eyeThe left eye3. The pineal glandThe pituitary bodyThe carotid glandthus presenting the mechanism through which the Spiritual Triad, the soul andthe personality work. [152] The key to a right understanding of process lies inthe relation of the three planets: Uranus, Mercury and Saturn, as they pourtheir energies through these nine “points of spiritual contact” upon thephysical plane into the “grounded sphere of light and power which is the man intime and space.”b. This centre is related to the first initiation and develops great activitywhen that point in experience is achieved, as it has been achieved by the vastmajority of men who are at this time the aspirants and the probationarydisciples of the world. (Forget not that, technically speaking, the first majorinitiation from the hierarchical angle is the third. The first initiation isregarded by the Masters as signifying admission to the Path. It is called aninitiation, by humanity, because in Lemurian days, it was then the firstinitiation, signifying entrance into complete physical control). It is the organfor the distribution of creative energy, of the energy of the third aspect bysouls at the above point of evolution. There are three centres in the humanbeing which are related to and the major expression of the third ray or aspectat certain differing stages of development upon the path:1. The sacral centre for the undeveloped and the average man.2. The throat centre for the aspirant and probationary disciple.3. The ajna centre for disciples and initiates.Here again you have a great triplicity of energies, containing great potenciestoday, owing to the fact that the expression of the third aspect of activeintelligence [153] has reached such heights through human development andconsciousness.c. It is related to the personality by the creative thread, to the soul by thethread of consciousness, and to the monad by the sutratma or life thread. It isnot related to any of the divine aspects by the antahkarana because that threadwhich links monad and personality directly (and finally independently of thesoul) simply anchors the monadic expression of life in the head, at the headcentre. Then direct consciousness is established between the monad and thepersonality, and a great duality comes into being. Life, consciousness and formare then all focussed creatively and actively in the head, and their activity isdirected from the head via the two head centres. The ajna centre only comes intocreative activity when the antahkarana has been built. In the earlier stages itis the throat centre which is the creative agent, and in the earliest period ofall the sacral centre is active. You have, however, one interesting thing toremember. The building of the antahkarana only becomes genuinely possible whenthe creative life of the aspirant shifts from the sacral centre into the throatand is becoming factual and expressive. Of this connecting “bridge,” the neckitself is the symbol, as it relates the head—alone and isolated—to the dualtorso, consisting of that which lies above the diaphragm and that which liesbelow—the symbol of the soul and the personality united, fused and blended intoone. The head is the symbol of what Patanjali describes as the state of“isolated unity.”d. It is the centre through which the intelligence aspect of humanity focussescreatively. It is therefore the [154] centre through which the creative energyof that great planetary centre called Humanity flows. The three major planetarycentres are Shamballa, Hierarchy and Humanity. When perfection has beenachieved, the Shamballa energy of will, power and purpose will pour freelythrough the head centre, the love-wisdom energies of the Hierarchy will flowthrough the heart centre, and the energy of humanity will focus through thethroat centre, with the ajna centre acting as the agent of all three. Then willtake place a new activity on the part of mankind. It is the task of relating thethree superhuman kingdoms to the three subhuman kingdoms, and thus establishingthe new heavens and the new earth. Then humanity will have reached the summit ofits evolutionary goal on this Earth.e. The throat centre is the organ specifically of the creative WORD. Itregisters the intention or creative purpose of the soul, transmitted to it bythe inflow of energy from the ajna centre; the fusion of the two energies, thusbrought about, will lead to some type of creative activity. This is the highercorrespondence to the creativity of the sacral centre. In that centre thenegative and the positive creative energies are embodied in the separate maleand female organisms and are brought into relation in an act of creation,consciously undertaken, though as yet without much definite purpose.f. The dense physical externalisation of this centre is the thyroid gland. Thisgland is regarded as of supreme importance in the well-being of the averagehuman being of today. Its purpose is to guard health, to balance the bodilyequilibrium in certain important aspects of the physical nature, and itsymbolises [155] the third aspect of intelligence and of substance impregnatedwith mind. It is in reality connected with the Holy Ghost, or the third divineaspect in manifestation, “overshadowing” (as the Bible expresses it), theMother, the Virgin Mary. The parathyroids are symbolic of Mary and Joseph andthe relation they hold to the overshadowing Holy Ghost. It will eventually bedetermined that there is a close physiological relation existing between thethyroid gland and the pineal gland, and between the parathyroids and the twolobes of the pituitary body, thus bringing into one related system the entirearea of the throat and of the head.g. Just as the head symbolises the essentially dualistic nature of themanifested God, so the throat centre symbolises the triple nature of the divineexpression. The dualistic nature appears fused and blended in the head in therelation between the two centres and their two dense physical reflections. Thethree great energies which are brought into play during the divine creativeactivity are unified in activity by the full expression of the energy flowingthrough the throat centre, through the apparatus of speech and the two lungs.You have in this relation: Life or Breath, the Word or the Soul, and the throatcentre of Substance in activity.h. This lotus of the throat is inverted in the early stages of evolution, andits petals reach out towards the shoulders and include the two lungs or parts ofthem. During the life cycle of the soul, it slowly reverses itself, and itspetals then reach out towards the two ears and include the medulla oblongata andthe carotid gland. This gland is more closely related [156] to the thyroid glandthan it is to the two other glands in the head.Thus it will be apparent to you how whole areas of the physical organism can bebrought into active and correct functioning, can be vitalised and kept in goodand true condition by the activity in some form or another of the centre nearestto the area of the body under consideration. It will also be apparent to youthat deficiency and disease can result from the inactivity of a centre.4. The Heart Centre. This is located between the shoulder blades and is—in thisday and age—the centre which is receiving the most attention from Those Who areresponsible for the unfoldment of the human consciousness. It might be trulysaid, brother of mine, that the rapid unfoldment of this lotus is one of thereasons why the world war could not be avoided. In one sense, it was a necessaryhappening (given the blind selfishness of the bulk of humanity) because it hadbecome necessary to do away with all the old forms of government, of religionand of the crystallised social order. Humanity has now reached a point of groupawareness and of group interplay of a deeply spiritual kind, and new forms wererequired through which this new spirit could function more adequately.a. The heart centre corresponds to the “heart of the Sun,” and therefore to thespiritual source of light and love.b. It is brought into functioning activity after the second initiation. Thatinitiation marks the completion of the process whereby the emotional nature(with its outstanding quality of desire) is brought under soul control, and thedesire of the personal lower self has been transmuted into love. It is the organfor the distribution of hierarchical energy, poured out [157] via the soul intothe heart centre of all aspirants, disciples and initiates; in this way thisenergy is made available and brings about two results:1. The regeneration of humanity through love.2. The relationship, firmly established, between a rapidly developing humanityand the Hierarchy. In this way two great planetary centres—the Hierarchy andHumanity—are brought into a close contact and relationship.As the Bible says: “the love of God is shed abroad” in the human heart, and itstransforming, magnetic and radiatory power is essential for the reconstructionof the world and for the establishment of the new world order. Upon theunfoldment of the heart centre, and on an intelligent relation of mankind to theHierarchy, with the consequent response of man to the energy of love, alldisciples are asked at this time to ponder and reflect, for as a “man thinkethin his heart, so is he.” Thinking in the heart becomes truly possible only whenthe mental faculties have been adequately developed and have reached a fairlyhigh stage of unfoldment. Feeling in the heart is often confused with thinking.The ability to think in the heart is the result of the process of transmutingdesire into love during the task of elevating the forces of the solar plexusinto the heart centre. Heart thinking is also one of the indications that thehigher aspect of the heart centre, the twelve-petalled lotus found at the verycentre of the thousand-petalled lotus, has reached a point of real activity.Thinking as a result of correct feeling is then substituted for personalsensitivity. It gives us the first faint indications, likewise, of [158] thatstate of being which is characteristic of the monad and which cannot be calledconsciousness—as we understand the term.c. The heart centre becomes essentially related to the personality when theprocess of alignment with the soul is being mastered. This process is todaybeing taught in all the newer and sounder esoteric schools, and has beenemphasised in the Arcane School from the start; it is that procedure(distinguished by right orientation, concentration and meditation) which relatesthe personality to the soul, and thus to the Hierarchy. Relationship to theHierarchy automatically takes place as this alignment goes forward and directsoul contact is thereby established. Personality consciousness is superseded bygroup consciousness, and the inflow of hierarchical energy follows as a naturalconsequence, for all souls are only aspects of the Hierarchy. It is thisestablished relationship, with its subsequent interplay (magnetic andradiatory), which brings about the final destruction of the soul body or causalbody as the relationship reaches its highest point of intensified recognition.d. It is that centre, therefore, in the physical body through the medium ofwhich the Hierarchy works; it is also the agent of the soul. When I here use theword “soul” I refer not only to the individual soul of man but to the soul alsoof the planetary Logos, both of which are the result of the union of spirit andmatter, of the Father aspect and the Mother aspect. This is a great mysterywhich only initiation can reveal.e. The heart centre registers the energy of love. It might here be stated thatwhen the antahkarana has been finally constructed, the three aspects of the[159] Spiritual Triad will each find a point of contact within the ethericmechanism of the initiate who is functioning upon the physical plane. Theinitiate is now a fusion of soul and personality through which the full life ofthe monad can be poured.1. The head centre becomes the point of contact for the spiritual will, Atma.2. The heart centre becomes the agent for spiritual love, Buddhi.3. The throat centre becomes the expression of the universal mind, Manas.In the work of the initiate, as he works out the divine purpose according to theplan, the ajna centre becomes the directing agent or the distributor of theblended energies of the divine man. The heart centre corresponds to “solar fire”within the solar system, and is magnetic in quality and radiatory in activity.It is the organ of the energy which brings about inclusiveness.f. Its dense physical externalisation is the thymus gland. Of this gland littleis known at present, though much will be learned as investigators accept andexperiment with the hypotheses which the occult sciences present, and as theheart centre develops and the thymus gland is returned to adult functioningactivity. This is not as yet the case. The nature of its secretion is not yetestablished, and the effects of this gland are better known from theirpsychological angle than from the physical. Modern psychology, when allied tomedicine, recognises that this gland when overactive will produce theirresponsible and amoral person. As the race of men learns the nature ofresponsibility we shall have [160] the first indications of soul alignment, ofpersonality decentralisation and of group awareness, and then—paralleling thisdevelopment—we shall find the thymus gland becoming correctly active. Atpresent, the general imbalance of the endocrine system militates against thesafe and full functioning of the thymus gland in the adult. There is as yet anunrecognised relation existing between the pineal gland and the thymus gland, aswell as between both of these and the centre at the base of the spine. As theSpiritual Triad becomes active through the medium of the personality, thesethree centres and their three externalisations will work in synthesis, governingand directing the whole man. As the pineal gland is returned to full adultfunctioning (as is not the case with adult man) the divine will-to-good willmake itself felt and divine purpose be achieved; when the thymus gland similarlybecomes active in the adult, goodwill will become apparent and the divine planwill begin to work out. This is the first step towards love, right humanrelations and peace. This goodwill is already making its presence felt in theworld today, indicating the coming into activity of the heart centre, andproving that the heart centre in the head is beginning to unfold as a result ofthe growing activity of the heart centre up the spine.g. It is the organ of fusion, just as the head centre is the organ of synthesis.As the heart centre becomes active, the individual aspirant is slowly drawn intoan increasingly closer relation to his soul, and then two expansions ofconsciousness take place which are interpreted by him as events orhappenings:[161]1. He is drawn into the Ashram of one of the Masters, according to his soul ray,and becomes an accepted disciple in the technical sense. The Master is Himselfthe heart centre of the Ashram and He can now reach His disciple, via the soul,because that disciple, through alignment and contact, has put his heart intoclose rapport with the soul. He then becomes responsive to the heart of allthings which, as far as humanity is at present concerned, is the Hierarchy.2. He is drawn into close service relationship with humanity. His growing senseof responsibility, due to heart activity, leads him to serve and work.Eventually he too becomes the heart of a group or of an organisation—small atfirst but becoming worldwide as his spiritual power develops and he thinks interms of the group and of humanity. These two relationships on his part arereciprocal. Thus the love aspect of divinity becomes active in the three worlds,and love is anchored on earth and takes the place of emotion, of desire and ofthe material aspects of feeling. Note that phrase.h. In the early stages of unfoldment, of both the individual and the race, theinverted heart lotus with its twelve petals reaches downwards towards the solarplexus centre. This last centre, since Atlantean days, has been reversed, andits petals are now reaching upwards towards the next centre up the spine, theheart centre, owing to the slowly mounting energies from the solar plexus centrewhich are seeking to escape from the “prison of the lower regions” through aprocess of transmutation.[162] As a result the heart centre is beginning slowly to unfold and also toreverse itself. The reversal of the “lotus centres” is always brought about asthe result of a dual action—the pushing from below and the pull from above.The reversal of the heart lotus and its upward unfolding is due to the followingfactors:1. The growing potency of the hierarchical approach.2. A rapidly establishing soul contact.3. The response of the unfolding heart lotus to the pull of the Master’s Ashram.4. The surging upwards of the transmuted energies from below the diaphragm, viathe solar plexus, in response to spiritual \"pull\".5. The growing understanding by man as to the nature of love.There are other factors but these are the ones you will most easily understandif you will regard them as symbolic and not too literally. Until the year, 1400A.D., the relation of the solar plexus centre to the heart centre might bepictorially expressed as indicated in this diagram on page 715.Eventually, at the close of the next root race, you will have the fullexpression of love and the lotuses up the spine will appear—all five ofthem—differing only in the number of petals found in each.Finally at the close of the great world cycle when all the lotuses have reversedthemselves, all will be opening and presenting free channels for the inflow andthe transmission of the three major divine energies and the four lesser forces.To this constant movement of the centres and to the constant inflow of energieswe can trace much of the discomfort of humanity in its various bodies; it is theinability of the centres to respond or to unfold which in many cases producesdisease and difficulty; it is the unbalanced unfoldment of the centres, theirarrested development and their lack of response which creates problems in othercases; it is their premature unfoldment and their overactivity which in othercases brings about danger; it is the failure of the physical mechanism tomeasure up to the inner unfoldment which causes so much trouble. Thus again youcan see the complexity of the subject. The stage of theory is a simple one,except in so far as it sets forces in motion which eventually lead todifficulty. The stage of reaction to response and of adjustment to the theoryalso institutes a cycle of intense difficulty and complexity, because it leadsto a cycle of experiment and experience during which the disciple learns muchand suffers much. Then as experience is gained, the stage of spiritualexpression supervenes and freedom from danger and emancipation from difficultyand liberation from disease takes place. Simplicity is restored.[163]The Body, Phenomenal AppearanceNot much need be written here anent this, for the body nature and the formaspect have been the object of investigation and the subject of thought anddiscussion of thinking men for many centuries. Much at which they have arrivedis basically correct. The modern investigator will admit the Law of Analogy asthe basis of his premises and recognises, sometimes, that the Hermetic theory,“As above, so below,” may throw much light on the present problems. Thefollowing postulates may serve to clarify:1. Man, in his body nature, is a sumtotal, a unity.2. This sumtotal is subdivided into many parts and organisms.3. Yet these many subdivisions function in a unified manner, and the body is acorrelated whole.4. Each of its parts differs in form and in function, but all areinterdependent.5. Each part and each organism is, in its turn, composed of molecules, cells andatoms, and these are held together in the form of the organism by the life ofthe sumtotal.6. The sumtotal called man is roughly divided into five parts, some of greaterimportance than others, but all completing that living organism we call a humanbeing.a. The headb. The upper torso, or that part which lies above the diaphragm.c. The lower torso, or that part lying below the diaphragm.d. The armse. The legs[164] 7. These organisms serve varied purposes, and upon their due functioningand proper adjustment the comfort of the whole depends.8. Each of these has its own life, which is the sum total of the life of itsatomic structure, and is also animated by the unified life of the whole,directed from the head by the intelligent will or energy of the spiritual man.9. The important part of the body is that triple division, the head, upper andlower torso. A man can function and live without his arms and legs.10. Each of these three parts is also triple from the physical side, making theanalogy of the three parts of man’s nature and the nine of perfected monadiclife. There are other organs, but those enumerated are those which have anesoteric significance of greater value than the other parts.a. Within the head are:1. The five ventricles of the brain, or what we might call the brain as aunified organism.2. The three glands, carotid, pineal and pituitary.3. The two eyes.b. Within the upper body are:1. The throat2. The lungs3. The heartc. Within the lower body are:1. The spleen2. The stomach3. The sex organs11. The sumtotal of the body is also triple:a. The skin and bony structure. [165]b. The vascular or blood system.c. The threefold nervous system.12. Each of these triplicities corresponds to the three parts of man’s nature:a. Physical nature: The skin and bony structure are the analogy to the dense andetheric body of man.b. Soul nature: The blood vessels and circulatory system are the analogy to thatall pervading soul which penetrates to all parts of the solar system, as theblood goes to all parts of the body.c. Spirit nature: The nervous system, as it energises and acts throughout thephysical man is the correspondence to the energy of spirit.13. In the head we have the analogy to the spirit aspect, the directing will,the monad, the One.a. The brain with its five ventricles is the analogy to the physical form whichthe spirit animates in connection with man, the fivefold sumtotal which is themedium through which the spirit on the physical plane has to express itself.b. The three glands in the head are closely related to the soul or psychicnature (higher and lower).c. The two eyes are the physical plane correspondences to the monad, who is willand love-wisdom, or atma-buddhi, according to the occult terminology.14. In the upper body we have an analogy to the triple soul nature.a. The throat, corresponding to the third creative aspect or the body nature,the active intelligence of the soul.b. The heart, the love-wisdom of the soul, the buddhi or Christ principle. [166]c. The lungs, the analogy for the breath of life, is the correspondence tospirit.15. In the lower torso again we have this triple system carried out.a. The sex organs, the creative aspect, the fashioner of the body.b. The stomach as the physical manifestation of the solar plexus is the analogyto the soul nature.c. The spleen, the receiver of energy and therefore the physical planeexpression of the centre which receives this energy, is the analogy to theenergizing spirit.I realise well the technicalities which I have given here and their difficultyand apparent uselessness. It might be asked: Why should it be necessary to be someticulous in enumerating the physical, psychological and systemic details of apurely academic nature when, by an act of the will and of divine power, and bythe use of certain Words of Power, healing can be accomplished? These ideas arebasically true, but are based upon a misapprehension—in time and space. If allhealers were Masters of the Wisdom, if they were all clairvoyant, if theycomprehended the Law of Karma and its working out in the life of the patient, ifthey had the full cooperation of the patient, and if they had the ability to addto all the above requirements the use of certain Words and Mantrams, then theacademic knowledge would indeed be needless. But these requirements are not andcan not be met. Healers, as a rule, have none of these powers. That theyfrequently heal (though not as often as they think they do) is true, but whensuccessful they have succeeded in doing one or other of the following:[167] Healed the patient when his destiny and fate so willed it and his soul hadtherefore drawn its vehicle (the physical man) into the radiatory aura of ahealer or a healing group. The probability is that the patient would haverecovered in any case but that the process was hastened by the applied effortand attention, plus faith.Interfered with the immediate design or pattern of the patient’s life, and sopostponed certain processes of spiritual tuition which were needed. This is veryapt to be forgotten. It is too intricate a subject to be dealt with here, but Imay be able to make it somewhat clearer as we deal with our final section.Therefore (until there is full knowledge) it is vitally necessary that thestructure of power and vitality and the network of energies and forces whichcompose the human organism should be studied. A mental grasp of the processes ofhealing is needed; and the reasons which make them seem difficult andcomplicated, unnecessary and wasteful of time, are as follows:The inability of even the most advanced human mind to grasp themes and subjectsas a whole. The synthetic element is as yet lacking. At present, the teachingand processes involved must be mastered step by step, detail by detail, preceptby precept, application by application. But the future holds the promise clear,and the ability of the human eye to function synthetically, to grasp alandscape, for instance, in its broad and salient outlines and to do thissimultaneously and in a flash of vision is the guarantee of the future techniqueof the race. One look by the illumined mind, one great radiation of love, andthe healer or the healing group [168] will know whether to heal, to aid theeffort of the patient—a much slower process—or to refrain from healing.The inertia of the average man or woman, which rebels against the effort neededto master the technical side of healing. It is so much easier to fall back ondivinity (a divinity in reality latent but not expressive) and “let God do it.”It is so much easier to recognise love and the outpouring of love than to masterthe processes whereby it can be made effective—or the nature of that which mustbe affected.These are points requiring careful attention and consideration. They meritreflection. The synthetic power of the mind, aided by true love, will some daybe the instrument of all true healers. In the meantime, for the sake of thefuture and in order to aid the formulation of the coming healing art—based onthe understanding of energy, its inflow and circulation—this treatise will dealsomewhat with the academic side. After all, the facts given are facts inexistence and are truly present, as are those emotions which the average healercalls love.The Seven Major Centres—(Continued)Let us now continue with our consideration of the centres. We have dealt withthe four above the diaphragm—the three centres through which the Spiritual Triadmust eventually work, and the synthetic centre, the ajna centre, which finallyexpresses the integrated personality and becomes the direct agent of the soul.We now have three more centres to consider, all of them to be found below thediaphragm—the solar plexus centre, the sacral centre, [169] and the centre atthe base of the spine. The most important for all aspirants at this time is thesolar plexus centre; the most active—generally speaking—in humanity as a whole,is still the sacral centre; the most quiescent centre in the body (from theangle of the spiritual man) is the basic centre.5. The Solar Plexus Centre . This is located well below the shoulder blades inthe spine and is exceedingly active. In Atlantean days, it was brought to a highstage of development, just as in Aryan days, the throat centre is being rapidlyawakened. This centre is peculiarly related to two other centres: The heart andthe ajna centre, and they form at this time an interesting triangle of energiesin the human body and one which is receiving much attention from the Hierarchy.There is a downflow of energy from the ajna centre to the heart from the soul,just in so far as the aspirant is in touch with his soul. This leads to threethings:A stimulation of the heart centre.A responsive reaction from the heart which evokes a stimulation of the ajnacentre and produces eventually the recognition of group consciousness by thepersonality.The evocation of the heart centre in the head.All this, however, is facilitated by the advanced development of the solarplexus in the aspirant, which has its own effect upon the heart and a reciprocaleffect upon the ajna centre. There are, consequently, two important triangles toconsider: [170][Image00006.jpg]Just as there is, astrologically, a Science of Triangles, so there will later bedeveloped a science of triangles in relation to the human system. But the timeis not yet. I but give occasional indications of such a science upon which theintuition of disciples may play.a. The solar plexus is a reflection in the personality of the “heart of thesun,” just as the heart centre is. It is the central factor in the life of thepersonality for all humanity below the grade of probationary disciple. At thatpoint the mind definitely begins to function, however faintly. It is theoutlet—if such a word can be used—of the astral body into the outer world, andthe instrument through which emotional energy flows. It is the organ of desire.It is of supreme importance in the life of the average man, and its control is avital goal for the aspirant. He must transmute desire into aspiration.b. The solar plexus came into full functioning in Atlantean times, during theperiod wherein the second great human race was developing. These lower centresare not so specifically related to initiations as are the centres above thediaphragm, for they are personality centres and have [171] to be under the fullcontrol of the soul when initiations of a certain degree are taken.c. The solar plexus centre is the great clearing-house for all energies belowthe diaphragm. This refers to the three major centres and the minor centreswhich were enumerated on page 72. The relation of this centre to the astralplane is (to use a peculiar but most expressive word) acute . It is therecipient of all emotional reactions and of desire impulses and energies and,because humanity is today becoming active in a group sense and is more inclusivethan ever before in human history, the situation is one of acute and extremedifficulty. Mankind, through the individual and also through the collectivesolar plexus, is being subjected to almost unendurable pressure. Such are thetests of initiation! It is not my intention to deal here with the processes ofattracting the lower energies, the mode of centralising them in the solarplexus, and there transmuting them and refining them to the point wheretransference into the heart centre becomes possible. Much of this is connectedwith the training given to accepted disciples, prior to the second initiation.It would be too intricate a matter to discuss, as well as carrying with itcertain peculiar dangers for those not ready for the process; it is, however,one that—under living effort—goes forward almost automatically. The solar plexusis thus the most separative of all the centres (except the ajna centre, in thecase of the man on the left-hand path) because it stands at the midway point,between the throat and the heart centres—above the diaphragm—and the sacral andbasic centres—below the diaphragm. This is a consideration of major importance.d. The solar plexus is the centre in the etheric vehicle through which humanity(average, unenlightened humanity) [172] lives and moves and has its being.Humanity is conditioned by desire—good desire, selfish desire, wrong desire, andspiritual desire. It is the centre through which most of the energies flow whichmake a man progressive because he is ambitious, selfish because his personaldesires are of importance, and fluidic because astrally polarised. Through itthe “bright light generated in Atlantis” is poured, and the astral light iscontacted. It is therefore the centre through which most mediums work andclairvoyants function. Later, these people will learn to work as intermediaries,consciously and intelligently using their powers; they will possess clearperception, and this will supersede clairvoyance. They will then be polarised inthe ajna centre. It is consequently a most disturbing centre in the body, and isa basic cause of the majority of stomach complaints and troubles connected withthe liver. The entire area immediately below the diaphragm is in a constantstate of turmoil, where average man is concerned; this is due to individual andcollective causes.It is interesting to note here that just as the ajna centre (the synthesis ofthe personality forces, when highly developed) is a great directing anddistributing agent, so the solar plexus centre (the synthesis of the averagedeveloped personality energies, prior to the process of integration) is a centrefor collection, for a gathering-in of all the lower energies, and is finally afocal point for the direction and distribution of these collectedenergies—remitting them to their receptive higher centres:1. The energies of the solar plexus centre itself have to be directed to theheart centre.2. The energies of the sacral centre have to be transmitted to the throatcentre. [173]3. The energies of the centre at the base of the spine have to be transferred tothe head centre. After the third initiation, these basic energies are raised,controlled or distributed by an act of the will of the Spiritual Triad. Then“the light generated in Lemuria” (the sacral light) and “the light generated inAtlantis” (solar plexus light) will die out, and those two centres will simplybe recipients of spiritual energies from on high; they will possess no direct,inherent light of their own; the light which they will transmit will come tothem from collective sources on etheric planes.The dense physical externalisation of this centre is the pancreas, with asecondary externalisation in the stomach. There is, in relation to the solarplexus centre, a curious relation which is symbolic both in form and inimplication. You have[Image00007.jpg]Here again appears the theme of a centre of spiritual force (for astral force isspiritual in essence) and its three manifestations. All these three densematerialisations are fed and nurtured by the forces and energies of the solarplexus centre. I have here given a very important fact to those who areinterested in the study of medicine from the esoteric angle; rightlyappreciated, it will lead to an understanding [174] of the healing art. Controlof the solar plexus centre, and the right reception and release of the energiesfocussed in that centre would bring about a major purification, an intensivestrengthening and a vital protection of the three vital organs to be found inthat area of the human physical mechanism.As I have earlier pointed out, this centre is an organ of synthesis and gathersinto itself all the lower energies at a certain point in the higher developmentof the human being. It is factually then an instrument (when rightly understoodand rightly directed) for aiding in the integration of the personality life. Themajor problem of the man who is highly developed but not yet spirituallyinclined is that of desire. What are his goals? To what are his aims directed?What is the nature of his realised ambitions? To what does he aspire? Accordingto the nature of the forces and the energies which his thought life brings tobear upon the solar plexus centre, so will be his decision to move forward alongthe path of light, to remain statically self-centred, or to take the lower waywhich leads to the blotting out of the soul light.As we have seen, the petals of the solar plexus centre are reaching upwardstowards the heart centre. This, in reality, means that emotional energy, desireand ambition (in the race of men as a whole) are striving upwards towards thehigher way.It should be noted here that the transference of solar plexus energy per se isthe task of all aspirants to the Path of Discipleship at this particular time,plus the gradual awakening of the heart centre. The first members of the humanfamily to become group conscious are naturally the aspirants and the disciples,and these set the pace for the rest of humanity. This they achieve through thepressure of life itself and of circumstances, and not by the following [175] ofset rules or specific meditations. Later, prior to a certain major initiation,such rules and measures may be applied so as to give the initiate immediate andconscious control over the astral body and its focal point of entry into thephysical organism, the solar plexus centre, and again at the time that certainmajor transferences are consciously made. Of these transferences there are threeof primary importance:1. From the three centres below the diaphragm into the heart, throat and ajnacentres.2. From the two centres above the diaphragm—the heart and throat centres—intothe ajna centre and the thousand-petalled lotus of the head.3. From the ajna centre into the head centre, signifying the completeunification of all the energies throughout the entire etheric body into onecentral focal point of distribution—under direct control of the Spiritual Triad.The processes involved in these three great experiences (each preceded by muchtesting and experiment) naturally put a strain upon the physical body and arethe cause of many of the ills to which disciples fall heir.It will be obvious to you, for instance, that the transference of all theaccumulated energies in the solar plexus centre into the heart centre will causedifficulty, very frequently of a serious nature; this is the reason why today somany advanced people die of heart disease. In the long cycle of the soul lifeand experience, this is of relatively small moment; in the short cycle of theindividual disciple’s life it is of great difficulty and oft of tragedy.Similarly, the transference of the energies of the five centres up the spineinto the head centres will carry with it its own problems. The stimulation ofthe ajna centre by the focussing of these energies may lead to disastrouspsychological problems. A [176] man may become an ego-maniac temporarily (all istemporary in the long life of the soul!) and become such a human monster asHitler and others of his ilk, though in lesser degree; there may be also violentconditions of epilepsy, or the eyesight may be affected and a man may becomeblind. All these points warrant careful thought.6. The Sacral Centre . This centre is located in the lower part of the lumbararea and is a very powerful centre, controlling as it does the sex life. One ofthe interesting things about this centre is that it must always remain apowerful centre until two-thirds of mankind have taken initiation, for thegenerative processes must go on and remain active in order to provide bodies forincoming souls. But as the race progresses, this centre will be controlled andits activities will be carried forward intelligently and as the result ofknowledge, of insight and of higher and subtler contacts, and not as the resultof unlimited and uncontrolled desire, as is now the case. I cannot enlargefurther upon this matter as the theme is too big. I can, however, bring to yourattention what I have already written, and suggest that someone with theinterest and the time should collect all I have said in all my books anent thesubject of sex so that a pamphlet on the subject may be compiled.a. The sacral centre corresponds to the physical sun, the source of vitality,and the life-giving agent on our planet.b. The symbolism of the sacral centre is concerned primarily with the gestationperiod prior to birth, and in its right understanding can be traced and expandedthe whole story of conception, of form-building, and this whether it is thephysical form of a human being, the form of an idea, an organisation [177] builtaround a central truth, the form of a planet or of a solar system. It is perhapsabove everything else the centre through which the forces of IMPERSONALITY musteventually express themselves, and the whole problem of dualism must beresolved. This solution and interpretation of the symbol must come from therealm of the mind, thereby controlling the physical reaction and occupyingitself with purposes and not with desire. Ponder on this. When it is thusunderstood, then we shall be reaching the point where a great transference cantake place into the higher centre of creation, the throat centre.c. The sacral centre is therefore closely related to matter, and there is a flowof energy between three points in the lower part of the human body:1. The spleen, the organ of prana or of physical vitality coming from the sun.2. The sacral centre, the predisposing agent towards physical generation.3. The centre at the base of the spine which (until the will aspect is arousedin man) feeds the life-giving principle, the will-to-live, to all parts of thehuman frame.These create a great triangle of force, concerned with matter, with substance,form-building, creation, vitality and persistence in form. This triangle is areflection of a much higher one, composed of1. The throat centre, corresponding to the sacral centre.2. The pituitary body, corresponding to the splenic centre.[178] 3. The pineal gland, corresponding to the basic centre.In the relation of these two triangles lies the clue to the instinct ofself-preservation, the survival of the subtle bodies after death, and theprinciple of immortality which is seated in the soul and functions whenself-preservation and survival no longer hold sway. This constitutes atriplicity of ideas which requires most careful study and which—if I might soexpress it—gives the key to the spiritualistic movement.d. The sacral centre is also connected with the ajna centre in the lastanalysis; the two together create a functioning duality which is productive ofthat subtle quality which we call personality . There is a wide field forinvestigation in the theme of personality as an integrated whole and in thequality of personality, which is the aroma, the influence, the effect and theradiation of a personality. I throw out these ideas to students, hoping thatsome research may follow which will relate this subject of the centres to therecognised facts of coordination, integration and their effects in producinggreatness.For those of you who are students of The Secret Doctrine , there is much to beunfolded anent the relation of the “lunar Lords,” the Barhishad Pitris, to thesolar Lord or Angel. The field of work of the former is the sacral centre, parexcellence; that of the solar Angel is the throat centre.e. The sacral centre registers the energy of the third aspect of divinity, justas the solar plexus centre registers that of the second aspect and the basiccentre expresses the energy of the first aspect. Here [179] again you have thelower centres reflecting the throat, heart and head centres and thus completingthe higher and the lower manifestation of the divine Trinity in man. This centrewas brought into full functioning activity in old Lemuria, the first human race;its energy is that of the Holy Spirit, overshadowing virgin substance. Hereagain we find also another divine reflection in the following:[Image00008.jpg]Eventually, in the Divine Hermaphrodite (later to appear) you will have anothercombination:[Image00009.jpg]Again you will note, my brother, how the Science of Triangles governs the humanframe in all its aspects, as well as the frame of a solar system. This is to beexpected.f. The dense physical externalisation of this centre is to be found in thegonads, the human organs of generation—[180] viewing them as a basic unity,though temporarily separated in the present dualistic expression of the humanbeing. It must be remembered that this separation fosters a powerful impulsetowards fusion, and this urge to blend we call sex. Sex is, in reality, theinstinct towards unity: first of all, a physical unity. It is the innate (thoughmuch misunderstood) principle of mysticism, which is the name we give to theurge to union with the divine. Like all else that undeveloped man has touched,we have perverted and distorted a divine idea and prostituted an immaterial urgeto material desire. We have reversed the direction of the sacral energy, hencethe over-developed animal nature and functions of average humanity.There is necessarily much more that I could add to the above, but the themewould require much careful analysis, elucidation and wording that time permitsnot, or the established balance of this Treatise would not be preserved.There is also little that I can say anent the centre at the base of the spine.Before, however, I take up whatever information is fruitful or possible, I wouldlike to point out that the diagram on page 715 portrays the point in evolutionof a disciple and not of an advanced initiate. It is not a description either ofthe everyday, average human being. This is indicated by the fact that thereflection of the heart centre in the head is turning upwards in response to anincreased activity of the heart centre itself, and that the definition of theajna centre is clear and exact, demonstrating an integrated, coordinatedpersonality. This is not therefore the diagram of the centres of the ordinary orundeveloped person. It is impossible for such diagrams to do more than give somepoint of consummation, but it should be remembered [181] that these points ofconsummation are not static attainments but are each of them preceded by phasesand stages of activity which produce constantly changing results and varyingaspects of the centres; these, in their turn, are succeeded by other cycles ofmovement, of change and of a renewed release of energies. The effects of thedeep underlying causes themselves become causes, for in the cycle ofmanifestation there is nothing static or fixed or finally determined. This is apoint of extreme importance. Be not therefore misled by apparent moments ofachievement. They are but prefaces to change, for such is the Law of Being.7. The Centre at the Base of the Spine . This centre is, above everything else,controlled and governed by the Law of Being, above referred to, and isestablished where spirit and matter meet and where matter, the Virgin Mary—underthe influence of the Holy Spirit, the energy of the etheric vehicle—istranslated “into Heaven,” there (as the Christian phraseology puts it) “to beseated beside her Son in the house of the Father.”This centre is found at the very base of the spine, and supports all the othercentres. It is relatively quiescent at this time, for it is only roused intofull activity by an act of the will, directed and controlled by the initiate. Itis responsive only to the will aspect, and the will-to-be in incarnation is thefactor which at present controls its life and produces its effects as it feedsand directs the life principle in matter and form. Just as we are told that thelife principle is “seated in the heart,” so the will-to-be is seated in the baseof the spine. There has been much idle and dangerous talk anent this centre, andthe whole subject of the “kundalini fire” has proved an exciting and enticingtale by the pseudo-occultists of the world. The true occultist in training hasnaught to do with the kundalini fire—as usually [182] understood. It is notpossible for me to do more than make certain facts somewhat clearer to you, andyet at the same time I must refrain from indicating modes and methods ofarousing the activity of this centre, on account of the extreme danger involvedin any premature work on the basic centre. The best I can do is to make a seriesof statements which will be comprehended in the right way by those who know (andthese are as yet few and far between), which will aid the thinking of those whoare in training and give them a somewhat more complete picture, but which willprotect the ignorant from disaster. I shall make these statements as clearly andbriefly as possible, but shall give practically no explanatory matter with them.1. This basic centre is the point where, under the evolutionary law, spirit andmatter meet, and life is related to form.2. It is therefore the centre where the essential dualism of the manifesteddivinity—man or planetary Logos—meet and produce form.3. The nature of this divinity is only revealed when the second aspect hasaccomplished its work, through the medium of the third aspect, but under thedirecting will of the first aspect.4. It is the centre where the “serpent of God” undergoes two transformations:a. The serpent of matter lies coiled.b. This serpent is transformed into the serpent of wisdom.c. The serpent of wisdom is translated and becomes the “dragon of living light.”5. These three stages are nurtured by the life and energy pouring down throughthe entire length of the spinal [183] column, via the etheric correspondence ofthe spinal cord, and—in time and space—this downpouring (plus the simultaneouslyuprising life) produces:a. The awakening in a gradual and orderly manner of the centres, according toray types.b. The reversal of the centres so that the consciousness of the indwelling manis adequate to his environment.c. The synthesis of the life energies of all the centres, and adequacy to thedemands of the initiate and the service of the Hierarchy and of Humanity.6. The spinal column (from the angle of the esoteric sciences) houses athreefold thread. This is the externalisation of the antahkarana, composed ofthe antahkarana proper, the sutratma or life thread, and the creative thread.This threefold thread within the spinal column is therefore composed of threethreads of energy which have channeled for themselves in the substance of theinterior of the column a “threefold way of approach and of withdrawal.” Theseare called in the Hindu terminology: the ida , the pingala and the sushumnapaths, and they together form the path of life for the individual man and areawakened into activity sequentially and according to ray type and the point ofevolution. The sushumna path is not used correctly and safely until theantahkarana has been built and the Monad and Personality are thereby related,even if it is only by the most tenuous thread. Then the Monad, the Father, thewill aspect, can reach the personality in a direct manner, and can arouse thebasic centre, and with it blend, unify and raise the three fires. [184]7. One of these paths is the one along which the energy which feeds matter ispoured. Another is related to the path of consciousness and of sensitive psychicunfoldment. The third is the path of pure spirit. Thus in every living form thework of the Father, of the Mother and of the Son is carried on.Life-consciousness-form and life-quality-appearance are blended, and theresponse apparatus of the divine man is perfected, enabling him to contact andrecognise the major divine aspects in the kingdoms in nature, in the planet andin the solar system—eventually.[Image00010.jpg]Be not betrayed into placing these interlaced spheres of living energy on theright or the left of the spinal cord. Constantly a movement, an interplay and areversal is going on. I can but portray the nature of a symbol which willindicate the special path of the three energies of the divine Trinity. Iindicate not a fact in location or place, for it is this materialising andlocalising of the main concept which has produced so much danger. Theinitiate-student seeks to grasp the relation of the three basic energies, thethree paths of living fire, their relation and inter-relation and theirsequential polarisation. He seeks not to narrow the teaching down to points andlines and place until such [185] time when these terms mean little to him and heknows more.8. These three paths of life are the channels for electric fire, solar fire andfire by friction, and are related in their usage to the three stages of the pathof evolution: the path of evolution in the material, earlier stages; the Path ofProbation, and the early stages of the Path of Discipleship until the thirdinitiation; and the Path of Initiation itself.9. The Kundalini Fire, about which so much is taught and written in the East,and increasingly in the West, is in reality the union of these three fires,which are focussed by an act of the enlightened will, under the impulse of love,in the basic centre. This unified fire is then raised by the use of a Word ofPower (sent forth by the will of the Monad) and by the united authority of thesoul and personality, integrated and alive. The human being who can do this infull consciousness is therefore an initiate who has left the third initiationbehind him. He, and he alone, can safely raise this triple fire from the base ofthe spine to the head centre.10. As usually interpreted by the ignorant esotericist in the various occultgroups, the kundalini fire is something which must be “raised,” and when it israised all the centres will then come into functioning activity and the channelsup and down the spine will be cleared of all obstruction. This is a dangerousgeneralisation and a reversal of the facts. The kundalini fire will be raisedand carried up into heaven when all the centres are awakened and the channels upthe spine are unimpeded. This removal of all obstruction is the result of thelivingness of the individual centres which, [186] through the potency of theirlife, themselves are effective in destroying all hindrances and obstructions.They can “burn up” all that hinders their radiation. What usually happens inthose accidental cases (which do so much harm) is that the aspirant, through hisignorant curiosity and by an effort of the mind (not of the spiritual will, butpurely as an expression of personality will), succeeds in arousing the lowest ofthe three fires, the fire of matter, fire by friction; this produces a prematureburning and destroys the etheric web in the etheric body. These circular disksor webs are to be found between each pair of the centres up the spine and alsoin the head. They are normally dissipated as purity of life, the discipline ofthe emotions, and the development of the spiritual will are carried forward.[Image00011.jpg][187] There are four of these webs. When the fourfold personality is highlydeveloped and the ajna centre is awakening, then these webs slowly andgradually, normally and automatically disappear. The webs in the head are ofmuch higher quality and bisect the skull horizontally and vertically. Thus theysymbolise the Cross upon which a Son of God is crucified.11. The three channels up the spine are responsive in their totality to thethree major centres:a. To the solar plexus centre, providing thus the impulse of desire and feedingthe physical life and the creative urge.b. To the heart centre, providing the impulse to love and to conscious contactwith ever widening areas of divine expression.c. To the head centre, providing the dynamic impulse of the will to live.I do not indicate which channel is responsive to which centre, except in thecase of the sushumna channel which is responsive only to the energy of the headcentre and the directing will, centred in the 1000-petalled lotus. This can besafely stated, as the spiritual will is as yet undeveloped in those who seek toarouse kundalini. When it is aroused, they will know what they can safely do.12. The three centres in the head are also related to this triple channel:a. The medulla oblongata area (the alta major centre) and the carotid gland.b. The ajna centre and the pituitary body.c. The 1000-petalled lotus and the pineal gland.Students will find it interesting to relate all these triplicities to the threemajor rays:[188]a. The first ray of will or power,b. The second ray of love-wisdom,c. The third ray of active intelligence,and also to the three human races which are endowed with the power to unfold theseed of these divine aspects: Lemuria, Atlantis and the Aryan race. These can belinked, as seed , to the two final races which will fuse and synthesise all theabove powers, qualities, achievements and goals into one perfected planetarylife.Another synthesis is also possible and of importance:a. Path of Evolution. . . . . . . .centres below the diaphragm.b. Path of Discipleship. . . . . . . .centres above the diaphragm.c. Path of Initiation. . . . . . . .centres in the head.These groups and triplicities are all related in time and space to the triplespinal cord.13. There is also—again in relation to all the above points of synthesis in thebody—one consummating point of complete fusion. I give each of these in thesequence of their work of fusion:a. The solar plexus centre, fusing the centres below the diaphragm.b. The ajna centre, fusing centres both above and below the diaphragm.c. The base of the spine, fusing all six centres.d. The thousand-petalled lotus of the head, fusing all the seven energies.Bear in mind, in connection with all the above, that we are dealing entirelywith forces and energies, functioning through the etheric body; that we aredealing with [189] the tertiary world of causes, which is responsible for theorganic world of the dense physical manifestation. This physical manifestationis itself subject to the influence of the secondary world of conscious life,which in its turn is responsive in time and space to the dynamic world ofpurpose and of Being.The key to the full life of the soul lies hidden in my words, but it takes thededicated life and the illumined mind to profit by the knowledge conveyed, andto see behind the form of words the key thought which gives it life and—occultlyspeaking—generative warmth.Have clearly in mind the concepts of stimulation or lack of stimulation, ofinterplay or of separativeness, of quiescence or of activity, for in thesedualities are to be found the causes of health or of disease.The Etheric Body, Nervous and Endocrine SystemsWhat I have to say here is based upon certain remarks in the previous pageswherein I pointed out that1. The etheric body itself2. The nervous system3. The endocrine systemare closely “related to each other and constitute an interlocking directorate ofenergies and forces which are essentially vital, galvanic, dynamic andcreative.... Upon them, the entire interior health of the body depends.” Tothese three I then added the blood stream as the conveyor throughout the body of1. The Life Principle,2. The combined energies of the three above systems,and pointed out that the great combination of forces which we call the pairs ofopposites or the major dualities, govern [190] the underlying causes of healthand disease. In making these statements, I am endeavouring to reduce our entiretheme to one of the utmost simplicity. In so doing, some of the truth is lost,but it is essential that certain broad generalisations are grasped by thestudent before he begins to study the exceptions and to deal with minutiae andthe detail of bodily defects or their opposites.It has become a truism with students of the occult that the etheric bodyconditions, controls and determines the life expression of the incarnatedindividual. It is a secondary truism that this etheric body is the conveyor ofthe forces of the personality, through the medium of the centres, and therebygalvanises the physical body into activity. These forces, routed through thecentres, are those of the integrated personality as a whole, or are simply theforces of the astral or emotional body and the mind body; they also transmit theforce of the personality ray or the energy of the soul ray, according to thepoint in evolution reached by the man. The physical body, therefore, is not aprinciple. It is conditioned and does not condition —a point oft forgotten. Itis a victim of personality life or the triumphant expression of soul energy. Itis for this reason that the science of psychology will, during the next twocenturies, dominate modern medical science, except in the category of thosediseases with which we will deal in our next section—those emanating from grouplife, such as tuberculosis, venereal diseases and cancer. Until the race is moredefinitely group conscious (something as yet far distant) it will not bepossible to apply broad psychological generalisations to the diseases indigenousto our planet. We can, however, consider the handling of similar difficultieswhich arise in the individual unit; these are based on the conflict of the pairsof opposites and upon the lack of harmony to be found in the three majorinterlocking, directing systems.[191] You have, therefore, three systems to carry in your minds, and one carrieror conveying agent, plus the basic occult fact that certain great opposingenergies, working within the body, produce what we call disease. To the abovefactors I would add another needed correlation. I would remind you that we areconcerned with forms of life, and that all these forms are creative withinthemselves, and can create potentially more forms or can provide environments inwhich these forms can live. Please note this mode of expressing a fundamentaltruth. The basis of all the occult teaching as regards manifestation is that thebuilding forces exist, and that this statement is true whether you are concernedwith the Life of a solar system or only with the consciousness of that body inwhich the human being moves and lives—along sound or unsound lines; we aredealing with the world body in which a human being lives. Owing to this, we comeup against another great natural Law which can be expressed simply as follows:LAW VIWhen the building energies of the soul are active in the body, then there ishealth, clean interplay and right activity. When the builders are the lunarlords and those who work under the control of the moon and at the behest of thelower personal self, then you have disease, ill health and death.This is a profoundly simple rule, but it gives the clue to the causes of diseaseand to the reason for an established immortality; it will be understood withgreat clarity and comprehension in a few years’ time and will then supersedethose idealistic but factually unsound and untrue systems to which we give thename Unity, Mental Science and Christian Science. These systems present asimmediate, demonstrable possibilities the stage of final liberation [192] fromthe natural and material limitations which today control all forms; they ignorethe time factor, and overlook the evolutionary process and also the point ofdevelopment of the person concerned; their position is based on wishful thinkingand on the innate desire of the average human being for comfort and physicalharmony, and gloss the innate selfishness of their presentation of truth withthe concept that all is to the eternal glory of God. Unquestionably, disease andphysical limitations of any kind will vanish, but this will only happen when thesoul of the individual controls and the lower personal self becomes as much anautomaton of the soul as the physical body is at this time the automaton of theemotional nature, of the mind, and occasionally (and only very occasionally forthe majority of people) of the soul.Only when the soul, consciously and with the cooperation of the personality,builds the temple of the body, and then keeps it full of light, will diseasedisappear; this building is, however, a scientific process, and in the earlystages of discipleship (which is the time wherein the soul begins to grasp itsinstrument, the personality) this leads inevitably to conflict, increased strainand frequently aggravated disease and disharmony. This dis-harmony and dis-easelead to much necessary trouble and consequent undesirable effects. These effectswill be overcome but—in the interim of adjustment—whilst they are registeringand expressing themselves, there will be much distress, physical andpsychological, and all the major and minor difficulties to which humanity seemsheir.In undeveloped humanity, the conflict (from the angle of consciousness) ispractically nil; you have less susceptibility to the subtler diseases emanatingfrom the three interlocking systems, but at the same time a much greaterresponsiveness to the three indigenous diseases, to infectious [193] andcontagious diseases, and to the great epidemics which sweep through nations andgreat planetary areas. As humanity develops, diseases become more personal (if Imight express it in this manner) and are not so definitely related to the herdor mass condition. They arise within the persons themselves, and though they maybe related to the mass diseases, they are based on individual causes.When a man steps out of the general mass and steps upon the probationary path,and thus becomes a candidate for discipleship, then the diseases of the fleshand the inharmony of his entire threefold system, plus the conveying stream,constitute a conscious problem and one which the aspirant must himselftackle—thus revealing to him the need for conscious, creative building.It is at this point that the doctrine of reincarnation becomes of supreme value;the disciple begins to institute those conditions, to create those forms andbuild those vehicles which, in another life, will prove more suitable for soulcontrol and more adequate instruments with which tocarry forward the perfectingprocess which the soul demands. Let me point out that the disciple does notconcentrate upon the physical body at any time, or begin with any physicalemphasis to work at the elimination of disease or disharmony. He begins with thepsychology which the soul teaches and commences with the causes which areproducing the effects upon the physical plane. It is a slower process, butendures . Much of the violent auto-suggestion of the systems allied to ChristianScience and Unity are only temporary in their effects and are based upon aprocess of scientific suppression, plus a refusal to recognise existent factors.They are not based on truth. In a later life, the suppressed condition willagain emerge in ever greater potency and will continue so to do until such timeas it is ignored altogether and the life emphasis is laid on soul contact [194]and the life expression is extroverted into service to others.In connection with physical disease and its relation to the centres (regardingthese as focal points for incoming energies from some source or another) itmight be useful if certain broad generalisations were made here, rememberingthat to all of these there may be exceptions, particularly in the case of thehealth or the non-health of disciples.1. Each of the seven major centres governs or conditions—from the material angleas well as from that of the soul and of the life principle—the area of thephysical body in which it is found, including the multitude of lesser centres ofenergy and plexi of force which may be found therein.2. The three great basic and manifesting divisions of divinity are to be foundsymbolically present in every centre:a. The life principle, the first aspect, discloses itself when the entire centreis esoterically unfolded or awakened. It is present all the time in latency, butit is not a dynamic factor producing monadic stimulation until the end of thegreat cycle of evolution.b. The quality or soul aspect is gradually disclosed in the process ofevolutionary unfoldment and produces, in time and space, the definite effectwhich the centre has upon its environment. This quality is dependent upon theray (either of the personality or the soul) which is the source of the incomingenergy, or upon the ray governing the astral body in the case of the littleevolved: it is also dependent upon the point in evolution and upon the radiatoryinfluence of other centres.c. The appearance in the etheric body of a developed or a developing centreindicates the place of the man upon the ladder of evolution, his racialaffiliations, and his conscious goal; this latter can range all the [195] wayfrom an emphasis upon the sex life, and consequent activity of the sacralcentre, to the goal of the initiate, which brings the head centre into activity.All this produces a consequent effect upon the surrounding tissue, substance andorganic forms within the radius of influence of the centre. The area of thisinfluence is variable according to the activity of the centre and this isdependent upon the point of development reached by the individual and thepreponderant type of energy to which the individual reacts.3. The incoming energy is transmuted within the centre into forces. Thisinvolves a process of differentiation into secondary energies of the primaryenergy involved, and is an automatic happening; the rate of transmutationprocess, the strength of the resultant aggregation of forces, and the subsequentradiatory activity producing conditioning results upon the dense physical body)are dependent upon the extent of the unfoldment of the particular centreinvolved and its awakened or unawakened state.4. The outgoing forces from a centre play upon the etheric counterpart of theentire intricate network of nerves which constitute the nervous system. Thesecounterparts of identical subjective correspondences are called in the Hinduphilosophy, the “nadis”; they constitute an intricate and most extensive networkof fluid energies which are an intangible, interior, paralleling system to thatof the bodily nerves, which latter system is in fact an externalisation of theinner pattern of energies. There is as yet no word in the English language or inany European tongue for the ancient word “nadi,” because the existence of thissubjective system is not yet recognised, and only the materialistic concept ofthe nerves as a system built up in response to a tangible [196] environment yetholds sway in the West. The idea of these nerves being the dense physical resultof an inner sensitive response apparatus is still undefined and unrecognised bymodern Western science. When recognition is accorded to this subtle substance(composed of threads of energy) underlying the more tangible nerves, we shallhave moved forward in our approach to the entire problem of health and disease,and the world of causes will be that much nearer. This network of nadis forms adefinite life pattern which varies according to the personality ray.5. The nadis, therefore, determine the nature and the quality of the nervoussystem with its extensive network of nerves and plexi covering the entirephysical body. The nadis, and consequently the network of nerves, are relatedprimarily to two aspects of man’s physical equipment—the seven major centres inthe etheric body (the substantial body which underlies the dense physical body),and the spinal column with the head. It must always be remembered that theetheric body is a physical body, though composed of subtler material than theone we can see and touch. It is made of substance or of that which “substands,”or underlies, every part and particle of the dense physical vehicle. This is apoint which will later receive attention from healers and from enlightenedmedical men in the New Age. When this relationship existing between the nadisand the nerves, and their joint relationship to the centres and spinal column isrecognised, we shall see a great revolution in medical and psychiatric methods.Experience will tend to show that the more closely the interplay between thesetwo—the nadis and the nerves—can be brought about, the more rapidly will thecontrol of disease also be implemented.[197] 6. The nadis in the physical body correspond to the life or spirit aspect;the nerves are the correspondence to the soul or quality aspect. That whichdemonstrates as their united externalisation is the endocrine system whichcorresponds to the form or matter aspect. These three—the nadis, the nervoussystem and the glands—are the material correspondences to the three divineaspects; they are esoterically responsive to these three aspects and they makethe man upon the physical plane what he is. These three groups are themselvesconditioned (via the seven centres, as we have earlier seen) by the astral ormental vehicles, or by the integrated personality, or by the soul which beginsto use the personality as a transmitting and transmuting agency, and—at theclose of the Path of Discipleship—by the monad, via the antahkarana, using thatself-created path as a direct channel of communication to the seven centres andfrom there to the threefold system of nadis, nerves and glands.7. These three major systems within the human being express through the mediumof the physical body the condition or the state of development of the centres.The life, the quality and the energy which they represent are conveyed to everypart of the physical vehicle via the blood stream. This, modern science isalready recognising as a fact, indicating that the blood stream conveys certainelements released by the glands. It does not yet recognise the fact of therelationship of the glands to the centres, with the intermediate systems ofnadis and nerves. The next great move in medicine will be to recognise the factof the etheric body, the physical substance which underlies dense matter.8. When the centres are awakened throughout the body, there will then be presenta highly electric nervous system, responsive with immediacy to the energycarried by [198] the nadis; the result of this will be a well-balanced endocrinesystem. The vitality and life pouring through the entire body will then be ofsuch potency that automatically the physical body will be resistant to disease,either innate, hereditary, or of group origin. In these words I express for youa future probability but not an immediate possibility. Man will some day havethe three systems perfectly coordinated, psychically responsive to the innerpattern of nadis and centres, and consciously integrated with the soul, andlater—via the antahkarana—with the Life principle.9. Today as there is uneven development, with some centres unawakened, othersoverstimulated, and with the centres below the diaphragm overactive, you haveconsequently, whole areas of the body where the nadis are in an embryonic state,other areas where they are highly energised but with their flow arrested becausesome centre along the path of their activity is still unawakened or—ifawakened—is still non-radiatory. These uneven conditions produce potent effectsupon the nervous system and upon the glands, leading to overstimulation in somecases, subnormal conditions in others, lack of vitality, overactivity, and otherundesirable reactions which inevitably produce disease. Such diseases eitherarise from within the body itself as the result of inherent (or should I sayindigenous) or hereditary tendencies or predispositions, present in the bodilytissue; or they arise as the result of the radiation or the non-radiation of thecentres, which work through the nadis; they can also arise as a result ofexternal impacts or contact (such as infectious or contagious diseases andepidemics). These, the subject is unable to resist, owing to the lack ofdevelopment of his centres.10. To sum all up: Disease, physical disability of any kind except of coursethose due to accidents and, to some [199] extent, to planetary conditionsinducing epidemics of a peculiarly virulent nature such as war oft produces),and the many differing aspects of ill health can be directly traced to thecondition of the centres, as they determine the activity or the non-activity ofthe nadis; these, in their turn, affect the nervous system, making the endocrinesystem what it is in the individual man, and the blood stream is responsible forthis condition reaching every part of the body.Effects Produced in Specific AreasLet us now consider certain of the effects of the above facts, and their effectupon the areas governed by the centres and in which disease appears.It will be apparent to you that as the energy pours through the centres, via thenadis and the nerves and potently affecting the glandular system and the bloodstream, the areas of the body become vitally involved and responsive. Thiscovers, of course, the head, the throat and the torso. The energy thusdespatched penetrates to every part of the physical vehicle, to every organismand to every cell and atom. It is the working of the quality of energy upon thebody which induces, stimulates, removes or palliates disease. I am not herereferring to the three major indigenous diseases (if I may call themthat)—cancer, syphilis and tuberculosis. With these I will deal later becausethey are planetary in scope, present in the substance of which all forms aremade, and are responsible for producing a host of lesser diseases which aresometimes recognised as affiliates but are frequently not so known.Those diseases which are loosely called mental diseases, and which are relatedto the brain, are little understood as yet. There was very little mental troublein the last rootrace, the Atlantean; the mind nature was then quiescent andlittle stimulation was conveyed through mental [200] levels via the head centreto the pineal gland and the brain. There was very little eye trouble either, andno nasal difficulties, for the ajna centre was unawakened and the third eyerapidly becoming inactive. The ajna centre is the organ of the integratedpersonality, the instrument of direction, and is closely related to thepituitary body and the two eyes, as well as to all the frontal areas of thehead. In Atlantean days, personality integration was largely unknown, except inthe case of disciples and initiates, and the goal of the initiate then, and thesign of his achievement, was this triple integration. Today, the goal is that ofa still higher fusion—that of the soul and personality. Speaking in terms ofenergy, this involves the formation, activity and related interplay of thefollowing triangles of force:I. 1. The soul, the spiritual man on his own plane.2. The personality, the threefold integrated man in the three worlds.3. The head centre.II. 1. The head centre, the point of the second fusion.2. The ajna centre, the point of the first fusion.3. The centre in the medulla oblongata, controlling the spine.III. 1. The pineal gland, the externalisation of the head centre.2. The pituitary body, related to the ajna centre.3. The carotid gland, the externalisation of the third head centre.All these triplicities, present within the circumference of the head, constitutethe mechanism through which:1. The soul controls its instrument, the personality.2. The personality directs the activities of the physical body.[201] The spinal column (esoterically, the ida, pingala and sushumna channels),the two eyes and the total brain tissue are receptive to, stimulated by, ornonreceptive to these energies in the head. In the latter case, the entire areais in a quiescent state, spiritually speaking, and the focus of energy iselsewhere.This deficiency or this stimulation, if unbalanced or if misapplied, willproduce some definite type of trouble, frequently of a physiological nature aswell as psychological, and in our Aryan times we shall see an increasing amountof diseases of the brain (a constantly increasing mental imbalance), and of eyedifficulties, until the nature of the centres and the type of incoming force andtheir regulation are recognised and carefully and scientifically studied. Thenwe shall see the science of the regulation of energy, as it conditions the humanbeing, developed. In the meantime, there is much difficulty everywhere, andmental diseases, neurotic conditions, insanities and, perhaps even moreprevalent, glandular imbalance, are on an expanding arc. To date, in the West,little is known as to the methods of control or cure, and in the East, wheresome knowledge can be found, nothing is done, owing to the apathy there present.The spinal column is primarily intended to be the channel through which theenergising of the centres and the distribution of energy to the surroundingareas of the body is carried forward by the intelligent, integrated personality,acting under the conscious direction of the soul. I refer not here to the bonystructure of the spinal column, but to the cord, its esoteric counterpart, andto the nerves which issue from the spine. Today this planned, directed esotericcontrol of energy is not present, except in the case of those with the initiateconsciousness and certain advanced disciples. There are inhibitions, blockages,unawakened areas, deficiency of vitality, lack of free flow and consequent lack[202] of development within the whole man; or else there is too muchstimulation, a too rapid vibratory activity, a premature awakening of thecentres, leading to the overactivity of the atoms and cells governed by anyparticular centre. All these conditions, along with others not mentioned, affectthe nervous system, condition the glands and produce psychological difficultyand disease in some form or another. You have the following simple yetsuggestive and symbolic diagram of the spinal column and the head, looking atboth from the angle of the centres and the glands:[Image00012.jpg][203] You will note that the spleen is not included in this diagram. Itsfunction is a peculiar one, being the centre of vitality in relation to theplanetary vitality and the radiation from the sun. It is not controlled in anyway from the spinal column. It must be borne in mind that this diagram is simplyan effort to relate in pictorial form the centres, the glands which theycondition, and the organs which are affected by both. It is not intended to be atrue picture of any physiological organic relations.The centre at the base of the spine has a unique function. It is to thesubstance of the body, to the physical tissue and to all matter not included inthe organs mentioned above, the source of life. In the perfected man, the twocentres (the highest head centre and the basic centre) represent the greatduality of spirit and matter, and they then control and govern, in perfectunison, the entire direction of the vehicle of the soul. Finally, you will havethe spiritual aspect of the human being expressing itself perfectly through therelated monad and personality (which is brought about by a third great majorfusion). The material man is then responsive to these two, via the head centre(the monad) and the basic centre (the spiritually energised personality). Thesetwo centres will then be in complete rapport, expressing the full nature of thespiritual man.It is essential that spiritual healers should get clearly in their minds thepicture of the areas in the body which are governed by the head centres and theother centres, because within those areas are the various organs which react todisease. The health of these organs is largely dependent upon the centres, asthey condition the glands and as the energy is distributed throughout the body.A full and balanced flow of energy from the centre into the area which itcontrols leads to resistance to so-called disease; [204] where there is lack ofdevelopment and an unbalanced situation, where the centres are concerned, therewill be no power to resist. The healing process in the New Age will start withdefinitely planned work with the centres, and the general trend of the healingart will then be—as you can easily see—preventive in nature rather thancurative. The whole emphasis will be upon the energy centres, energy currentsand the direction of energy to the organs within the radius of the influence ofany particular centre. From a study of the glands (a study so much in itsinfancy that it hardly merits the word “embryonic”) much will be later learnedof their relationship to the centres, and much experimental work will be done.From the standpoint of the esotericist who admits the fact of the centres, theglands are, par excellence, the major determining factor in connection with thegeneral health of an individual; they indicate not only his psychologicaldevelopment far more than is today grasped, but they have (as is suspected bythe orthodox medical science) a most potent effect upon the whole organicsystem; their influence, via the blood stream, reaches into every part of thebody and to the extremities. The glands are the result of the activity of thecentres; they are first, last, and all the time effects of inner predisposingcauses , and it is through the centres and their affiliated glands that the soulbuilds the apparatus upon the physical plane which we call the physical man.Therefore, the group of related factors with which we have been dealing must becarefully studied and grasped by any practicing healer, for he will eventuallyhave to work through his own centres in relation to the patient whose ills he isendeavouring to heal. He must remember, consequently, three factors: Thecentres, their related glands, and the group of organs for which these two areresponsible. You have in the seven areas of the body, governed by the [205]seven major centres and their affiliated glands, the appearance again of thebasic trinity of manifestation:1. Life or spirit..........the energy centre.2. Soul or quality......the gland.3. Form or matter.....the organs in any particular area governed by any onecentre.This brings us to another law which the healer must ever have in mind.LAW VIIWhen life or energy flows unimpeded and through right direction to itsprecipitation (the related gland), then the form responds and ill healthdisappears.This is a basic law in healing and concerns the true art of relating spiritualenergy with form life, and upon this the health and the vitality of the organsdepend. Therefore we come to the next rule which the healer has to master. Thisis concisely expressed, and those phrases which convey instruction must beunderstood and applied intelligently.RULE FIVELet the healer concentrate the needed energy within the needed centre.Let that centre correspond to the centre which has need.Let the two synchronise and together augment force.Thus shall the waiting form be balanced in its work.Thus shall the two and the one, under right direction, heal.It will be obvious to you, therefore, that healers at the present time (I refernot here to the medical profession but to the multitude of the many schools ofthought) have not yet got back to the basic factor, in spite of all their talkanent love being the healing force. They are in reality [206] emphasising anddealing with the motive which impels the healer to ply his healing art. They areconcerned with the instrumentality whereby contact can be made with the patientto be healed. That contact must ever be established in LOVE—fresh, compellingand selfless. But once that relation is established, the healer must grasp thefact that, as far as he is concerned, he must work scientifically; he must applyknowledge and—after right diagnosis, after right modern therapeutic methods,after due common sense, which includes the best that the tried science ofmedicine can give—he must then begin to work through his own centre, putting iten rapport with the centre in the patient which governs the distressed area ordiseased organ.As he thus works, the energy which loving intent and skilled knowledge hastapped and brought in is not permitted (during the healing process) to stimulateor affect the healer’s own related glands or produce action in the connectedarea of his own body. The healer must learn to insulate himself from the energyto be used on behalf of the patient. He blends it with the energy of thepatient’s centre, governing the diseased area; the allied gland is then doublyenergised (or lessened, as the case may be and diagnosis requires), and theblood stream releases into the diseased tissue that which is needed to cure orprevent the growth of the disease.In this instruction I have given you much food for thought. I have emphasised anaspect of scientific esoteric healing which has not before been brought to theattention of students. I would have you grasp the general picture and get theoutlines of process clear; I would have you study the relation between thehealer and the patient as he passes out of the stage of just loving and sendingout love or of seeing the patient in the light of love, and goes on to thescientific work of augmenting the patient’s own spiritual [207] energy. He thusenables him to effect his own cure, consciously or unconsciously.You have, therefore, the healer, the patient and the reservoir of spiritualenergy, plus the scientific process of bringing all three into a close andhealing rapport. This is done via the centre concerned in the equipment of thepatient, the corresponding centre in the equipment of the healer, and thedirection (by an act of the will of the healer or of the healing group) of theunited streams of required specific energy to the area diseased. This is usuallydone via the related gland, though it is not always so.Ponder on these things and see, if you can, the simplicity of the process whichis based on loving intent, which isolates the specific area in which the troubleexists, which identifies itself with the spiritual centre of energy in thepatient, and which then applies and directs the fused and blended energies.Effects of Under-Stimulation and Over-Stimulation of the CentresWe have been for some time studying the centres and their relation to the densephysical body. We have also noted the areas which are conditioned by thesecentres and the mediating work of the ductless glands. We have seen that twomajor predisposing causes of physical trouble, arising within the physicalorganism, are the understimulation or the overstimulation of the centres. Thereare also, as you will recall, three diseases which are inherent in substanceitself, and which therefore create basic predispositions within the human body:cancer, syphilis and tuberculosis. With these three we are not at this timedealing. But the condition of the centres produces, basically, all thedifficulties, permitting entrance to infections and germs which might nototherwise cause trouble, producing those situations [208] where the diseasesinherent in the form nature can be fostered, and making undesirable tendenciespowerful. We might consequently lay down the premise (one which the medicalprofession will later accept in its entirety) that diseases which areself-engendered (if I may use so curious and inadequate a phrase), and which arenot the result of contagion or infection or of accidents, are caused by thefailure, the limitation, the deficiency or the excess, and by theoverdevelopment or the underdevelopment, of the endocrine system. This ductlessglandular system, via the hormones, affects every part of the physicalorganism—via the blood stream—and it may therefore be truly posited that whenthe ductless glands are perfectly balanced and functioning correctly, there willbe no diseased areas in the body. The blood stream will then be kept also inperfect condition. The clue to perfect physical health as it is expressed by aMaster of the Wisdom can consequently be directly traced to His full control ofthe centres, to their balanced state of energy reception and distribution, andto the effect which they produce upon the entire ductless glandular system. Bythis means every area of the body is properly supplied with the needed forcesand is thus kept in perfect condition.Coming midway between the centres and the corresponding endocrine glands, andacting as the agent for the distribution of energy, is the nervous system. Here,however, difficulty is usually to be found. There is a lack of adequate flow ofenergy; the energy distributed by its means to the body, via the centres, isunevenly distributed; some centres receive an undue supply; others receive aninadequate amount; some centres are still unawakened, and therefore arenonreceptive; others are prematurely developed and transmit too much force tothe areas they govern. In esoteric medicine and its philosophical interpretation(which is in the last analysis the effective and practical application [209] ofthe known facts) it is the cerebro-spinal aspect which conditions and governsthe entire nervous system, for it is by means of this aspect and through itsagency that the centres work and affect the bodily organism, supplying the bodywith the needed vital energy; thus the nervous system becomes eventuallyresponsive, via the seven centres, to the seven major energies or the seven rayforces.In no human being, except a Master, are all the centres properly awakened andfunctioning in a balanced manner, nor are they properly related throughintensive radiation; in no human being is the nervous system correctlyresponsive to the centres. There are two reasons for this, and both are relatedto the cerebro-spinal system:1. The head centre is not yet awakened, or is only slowly being developed, asthe disciple submits himself to training.2. The flow of energy through the head to the centres up the spine is uneven,owing to the fact that the inflow is uneven, and that the etheric web—betweenthe centres—permits as yet only a very little energy to flow through to all thecentres.It must be remembered that the life of the centres is founded, in the initialstage, upon the inherent life of the organism itself, with the focus of theemanating life to be found in the centre at the base of the spine. This is apoint oft forgotten by esotericists. This basic centre is the one through whichthe life of matter itself works; this is the life or energy of the Holy Spiritaspect, the third aspect. Through its life each atom in the body is fed. Thisprocess of animating the substance of the physical form is started in theprenatal stage; after birth, this type of force is aided and paralleled by theinflow of planetary prana or vital energy from the planetary life itself, viathe spleen. [210] This is the essential relating organ between the inherent lifeof matter itself, as present in the microcosm, and the inherent life in theplanet.As evolution proceeds, there is gradually added to this inherent force an inflowof “qualified” energy which is expressive of the consciousness aspect ofdivinity, and indicates to the esotericist the state of awareness of the man andalso the ray type of his soul. This inflow comes from the second divine aspect,from the soul or the indwelling Christ. It might therefore be stated anent thetwo head centres that:1. The ajna centre, or the personality centre, focussed between the eyebrows andconditioning the pituitary body, is related to the entire life of the integratedthreefold organism. Through this organism the consciousness must perforceexpress itself, and the physical, emotional and mental vehicles demonstrate itspoint in evolution.2. The head centre (called in the Hindu philosophy, the thousand-petalled lotus)conditions the pineal gland and is related to the life of the soul and—after thethird initiation—to the life of the monad; it conveys to the centres the energyof the three major types of spiritual being of which the three forces of thepersonality are the reflections or physical counterparts.Later, energy from the spirit aspect, the first or Father aspect, will becomeavailable and will pour down through the head centre to the ajna centre,combining personality energy and soul energy. Then, by an act of the will, it isprojected down the spinal column, via the alta major centre, which conditionsthe carotid gland. As it passes down the spinal column it vitalises two aspectsof the centres; when [211] it reaches the basic centre, it combines with thelatent energy of substance itself, and you have, therefore, the union of allthree divine energies and the manifestation in man of the three divine aspects.These combined energies then rush up the central channel in the spinal column,and the third or highest receptive aspect of the centres is energised. All thecentres are thus brought into full expression; all limitations are destroyed;every part of the body is vitalised and material perfection is produced, plusthe full play of the enlightened consciousness and also of the life aspect.The nervous system then comes under the complete control of the spiritual man,and the blood stream is purified and becomes an unimpeded and satisfactorychannel for the circulation of that which the energised glands discharge. Thisis the esoteric significance of the Biblical words, “The blood is the life,” andalso of the words “saved by the blood of Christ.” It is not by the blood of aChrist dying two thousand years ago upon the cross in Palestine that man issaved, but by the livingness of the blood of those in whom the Christ life andconsciousness, and the quality of the Christ, is perfectly demonstrating andexpressed. Then, when the nature of the indwelling Christ is fully,spontaneously and automatically expressing itself in and through thepersonality, the three fires of the creative process—the fire of matter, thefire of the soul, and the electric fire of spirit—are blended, and there is thena perfect manifestation on Earth of physical living, of the emotional and mentallife, and also of the spiritual life of an incarnated Son of God, a Christ.It is on this point of understanding that so many worthy people go astray,particularly in the mental science movements, in the Unity movement, and inChristian Science. Instead of focussing their effort on achieving the pure life[212] of Christ in every day life, and acting as consecrated servers of theirfellowmen and as channels for love, and becoming aware only of the consciousnessof the whole, they are focussed on affirming a future perfection—mentally andvocally—in order to have good health and physical comfort. They regard it astheir right and due, to be gained by affirmation, and forget the hard worknecessary to bring about within themselves those conditions which will make thedivine manifested Christ present. They need to bear in mind that good healthwill be normal and declarative if the inner consciousness is harmless (and themajority of these people are guilty of a superior spirit of criticism), if theyare decentralised from the lower self in the three worlds, and if they are“focussed in heaven, thereby enabling the heavenly Son of Man Who is the Son ofGod to lead the heavenly life when far from the heavenly realm”—as an oldChristian mystic, long forgotten, used to say. His words have been remembered bythe Master M—and thus recalled to my attention.Another school of thought, branding themselves untruthfully as occultists, areequally in error. They work, or rather profess to work, with the centres, onlyfortunately for them nature protects them often from themselves. They endeavourconsciously to vitalise the centres, to burn away the protective web, and toraise the fires of matter before the fire of spirit has combined with the fireof the soul. They then fall victims to premature stimulation of the fires ofsubstance before the balancing of the forces can take place. Disease,insanities, and many neurotic conditions, plus serious pathological conditions,then occur. Some of the glands become overactive; others are overlooked, and theentire glandular system and the dependent nervous system are in a state ofcomplete imbalance.[213] Disciples need to learn to focus their attention upon the reality and uponthe factors of primary spiritual importance. When they do this, the energies inthe head, the correct use of the spinal area with its “beaded centres,” and theawakening of the basic centre and its consequent fusion with the higher energieswill be an automatic and perfectly safe happening.The orderly rhythm of the glandular system and the free, safe use of thecontrolled nervous system will then be possible; the energies, projected fromthe centre, via the nadis, will be safely related and brought into a syntheticfunctioning within the body, and the disciple will experience not only a fullyawakened consciousness, and a brain which is ever intelligently receptive, but aconstant inflow of spiritual life. There will then be that perfect balance andperfect health which characterise a Master of the Wisdom.Knowledge concerning the endocrine or ductless glands is as yet in an embryonicstate. Much is known anent the glands connected with the sacral centre and aboutthe thyroid gland, but to date, naturally, the medical profession does not admitthat they are effects of the activity or the nonactivity of the centres, or thata line of least resistance exists between the sacral centre and the throatcentre. Something is known (not much) about the pituitary body, but its extremeimportance as it affects the psychological response of the person is notadequately grasped. Nothing is known, factually speaking, about the pineal orthe thymus glands, and this because neither the head centre nor the heart centreis awakened in undeveloped man, or even in the average citizen. That there is aconsiderable wealth of knowledge anent the sacral centre (as the source ofphysical creation) and the conditioning effects of the thyroid gland is due tothe fact that both these centres are awakened in the average man, and when thefunctioning is adequate [214] and the necessary interplay is established, youthen have a highly sexed individual who is also a creative artist along someartistic line. This is very frequently seen, as you well know. When the ajnacentre and its externalisation, the pituitary body, are also active, and therelation between the three centres—sacral, throat and ajna centre—is awakenedand beginning to function, and definite conscious relationship is being set upbetween it and the other centres (dependent upon ray, upon conscious objectiveand training), then you will have the practical mystic, the humanitarian and theoccultist.Students should remember that there is both an upward and a downward trend ofenergy within the entire structure of centres, where the aspirant and thedisciple are concerned:1. The upward trend ...producing Transmutation.From the sacral centre to the throat centre. Physical creation is transmutedinto artistic creativity.From the solar centre to the heart centre. Individual, emotional consciousnessis transmuted into group consciousness.From the base of the spine to the head centre. Material force is transmuted intospiritual energy.From any or all of the five spinal centres to the ajna centre. Uncoordinatedliving is transmuted into personality integration.From the six centres in relationship into the highest head centre. Personalityactivity is transmuted into spiritual living.This is a wide generalisation, and the process is not carried forward in anysequential fashion or smoothly and in order as the tabulation above mightsuggest. The process involved is spread over many lives of unconscioustransmutation in [215] the earlier stages, and as a result of bitter experienceand of conscious effort in the later stages, and becomes increasingly dynamicand effective as the various stages upon the Path area trodden by the aspirant.The five rays with which a disciple has to work (two major conditioning rays andthree subsidiary rays) have a definite active effect; karmic adjustments provideopportunity or hindrance, and the intricacies of the entire process (within therelatively limited experience of the disciple) are so confusing whilst inprocess that all that he can do is to grasp the general outline as here givenand not pay too much attention to the immediate factual detail.2. The downward trend. ..producing Transformation.Once the head centre is awakening and the disciple is consciously active in thework of directing the energies to the centres and thereby governing hispersonality life, there is a scientific undertaking of energising the centres ina certain ordered rhythm which is again determined by the rays, by circumstanceand by karma; thus all the bodily energies are swung into correct spiritualactivity. With the process involved we cannot here deal, beyond pointing outthat this downward trend can be roughly regarded as falling into three stages:1. The stage of energising the creative life, via the throat centre, thusbringing:a. The head centre and the throat centre,b. These two and the sacral centre,c. All three, consciously and simultaneously, into conscious relation.This relation, when properly established, will solve the individual problem ofsex, and without recourse to either inhibition or suppression, but by bringing[216] about right control and making the disciple, at the same time, creative ina worldly sense, and therefore of use to his fellowmen.2. The stage of energising the conscious life of relationship via the heartcentre, thus bringing:a. The head centre and the heart centre,b. These two and the solar plexus centre,c. All three, simultaneously and consciously, into close cooperation.This serves to establish right human relations, right group relations, and rightspiritual relations throughout a man’s entire life expression. Just as the stageof regulating the creative life has a paramount effect upon the physical body,so this stage affects the astral vehicle with great potency; emotional reactionsare transformed into aspiration and service; selfish individual love istransformed into group love, and then divinity rules the life.3. The stage of energising the entire man, via the basic centre thus bringing:a. The head centre and the basic centre,b. These two and the ajna centre,c. All the three, simultaneously and consciously, into rhythmic, coordinatedexpression. This is a final stage of great importance, and only takes place inits completeness at the time of the third initiation, that of theTransfiguration.You can see, therefore, how three important words convey the purpose of thescientific unfoldment and the right direction of the centres:Transmutation. Transformation. Transfiguration.[217] This process is wisely and safely carried out over a long period of timeand—returning to our theme of health and of disease—when consummated, perfectphysical health is the result; in the interim process of adjustment and ofchange, the reverse is frequently the case. The danger involved in a largenumber of physical ills can be traced to the condition of the centres, to theinterplay or their lack of interplay, to an undeveloped condition, unawakenedand sluggish, and to an overstimulation or an unbalanced activity. If one centreis prematurely awakened, it is frequently at the expense of other centres. Therude health of the savage or of the unskilled and unintelligent labourer orpeasant (a state of being which is rapidly passing as the mind development andthe process of evolution take effect) is largely due to the quiescent state ofpractically all the centres, with the exception of the sacral centre. The factof their falling easy prey to the infectious diseases can also be traced to thesame quiescence. As the emotional nature is developed and the mind begins tofunction, the centres then become more active. Definite trouble then ensues,largely because psychological conditions begin to appear. The man is no longersimply an animal. The wear and tear of the emotional life (the majorpredisposing factor in ill health) floods the lower nature with ill-directedenergy (or should I say mis-directed?). The solar plexus centre then becomesunduly active and this activity falls into four stages:1. The stage of its awakening, as the astral body becomes steadily morepowerful.2. The stage of its potency when, for lives, it is the conditioning centre inthe etheric or vital body and the man is consequently entirely conditioned byhis emotional-astral life.[218] 3. The stage wherein the solar plexus centre becomes the clearing housefor all the centres (major and minor) below the diaphragm.4. The stage wherein the solar plexus energies are raised to the heart.All these stages bring, temporarily, their own physical ills.You will note that, beyond certain generalisations, I am not relating specificdiseases to specific centres. I have indicated the areas conditioned by thecentres, and far more powerfully conditioned than you have any means yet ofascertaining; I have said that fundamentally the ductless glands—asexternalisations of the centres—are the determining factors in the health of thebody, and that where there is imbalance, overdevelopment or underdevelopment youwill have trouble; I have suggested that the medical profession in the New Agewill deal increasingly with the theory of energy direction and its relation tothe ductless glands, and that it will admit, at least hypothetically and for thepurpose of experimentation, that the theory of the energy centres may be correctand that they are the primary conditioning factors, working through the ductlessglands which, in their turn, guard the body, produce the necessary resistance,keep the blood stream supplied with the essentials to health and—when rightlyinterrelated—produce a balanced expression of the spiritual man throughout theentire physical body—physiological and psychological balance. When thisdesirable condition is not the case, then the ductless glands, through wrongrelationship and incorrect and unbalanced development, are not adequate to thetask; they cannot protect the body from disease, and are unable to pour into theblood stream what the physical vehicle needs. Owing to their inadequacy, thebody is unable to resist infections, is in a constant state of ill health, [219]and cannot cope with disease coming from without or latent within the organismof the body; this weakness often produces mortal disease.Medicine in the next century will be built around certain major premises:1. Preventive medicine will be the goal, producing the attempt to keep the bodyin proper balanced order.2. Sound sanitation and the providing of healthy conditions will be regarded asessential.3. The supply of the right chemical properties to the physical body will bestudied—a science of chemistry which is yet in its infancy, though it isbecoming a flourishing infant.4. An understanding of the laws of vitality will be regarded as of primeimportance, and of this the emphasis today on vitamins and the influence of thesun are wholesome indications.5. The use of the mind will be regarded, above everything else, as a factor ofmajor importance: the mind will be seen as the prime influence as regards thecentres, for people will be taught to work on their centres through mental powerand thus produce a right reaction from the endocrine system. This willnecessarily involve the right directing of thought to a centre, or thewithdrawal of attention from a centre, with consequent effect upon the glandularsystem. This will all be based upon the occult law that “Energy followsthought.”Owing to the fact that disciples have a greater development of mental power thanthe average man, and also to the fact that ray type is more easily ascertained,involving consequently a more correct determination of the condition of theglandular system, they will be the first to cooperate [220] with the medicalprofession and to demonstrate the relation of the centres to the glands, andtherefore to the body as a whole. Through concentration and right meditation,carried on in the head centre, and directed towards some one or other of thecentres, disciples will demonstrate such definite changes in the ductless glandsthat the medical profession will be convinced of the importance and the factualexistence of the centres and of their power, and also of the possibility ofcontrolling the physical organism through the power of thought. This all lies inthe future. I am but pointing the way and indicating a future technique wherebydisease will be overcome. The various mental schools of thought, Unity andChristian Science, have been fantastic and fanciful in their claims anddefinitely unscientific in their approach. But they have had hold of at leastone thread in the great process of right adjustment to life and to rightrelationships. They had the dream and the vision; they lacked perception andcommonsense and ignored the evolutionary process.Physiological science and psychological power, plus the cooperation of thetrained disciple with the trained medical man (particularly with the open-mindedendocrinologist), will eventually succeed in solving many human ills and willbring about the cure of the bulk of the diseases now troubling humanity.We have, therefore, studied to some purpose our first section: The PsychologicalCauses of Disease. We have carried the idea down from the inner and more subtlecauses of disease to the major physical conditioning factor, the ductlessglands. We can now briefly consider certain far more occult causes and deal withthose which emanate from the group life of humanity and from the karmicliabilities of mankind. Here we shall enter the realm of occult knowledge and ofesoteric information, and this will be far more difficult for the orthodoxthinker to accept."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II - CAUSES EMANATING FROM GROUP LIFE[221] In considering disease and its basic causes, we have dealt particularlywith those which concern our Aryan race and modern humanity; these are largelyastral in origin and might be described as Atlantean in nature. We have brieflyconsidered also the various diseases which originate upon the mental plane;these are more strictly Aryan and involve also the ills to which disciples areprone. Infectious diseases and those which are fundamental in the planetarysubstance have a potent effect upon those races (still among us) which are theoldest on our planet, and which are related to the fast dying out Lemuriantypes; Negroes are specially prone to infectious epidemics.I have not attempted in this treatise to deal pathologically with any of thediseases touched upon, nor have I paid attention to the physiology of thepatient. That is entirely out of my province. I have, however, attempted toindicate the origins of some of the diseases, to call attention to the paramountimportance of the glandular system, and to relate, as far as is just and wise,some of the oriental theories anent the centres and western wisdom. Later Ishall point out some basic human conditions which must be changed if the truehealing work is to be correctly applied, and then I hope to give some of themethods whereby healers can accomplish work which will be in line [222] with thefacts of the case and which will aid in the processes of restoration.The problem of disease is today greatly enhanced, owing to the fact that in thisrace, the Aryan, which now dominates the planet, you have the first trueappearance outwardly on the physical plane of the basic synthesis of humanitywhich will be—in its better form—so strikingly significant of the next majorrootrace, the sixth. Inter-marriage between nations and races, the fusion ofbloods for hundreds of years—due to migration, travel, education and mentalunity—has led to there being no really pure racial types today. This is far morecertainly the case than the most enlightened think, if the long, long history ofmankind is considered. Sexual intercourse knows no impenetrable barriers, andpeople today have in them all the strains and the blood of all the races, andthis (as a result of the world war, 1914-1945) will be increasingly the case.This development is definitely a part of the divine plan, no matter howundesirable it may appear to those who idealise purity of relationship, or howruthless its application is at the present moment. Something intended is beingbrought about and it cannot be avoided. The urge to mate becomes peculiarlystrong when men are removed from their familiar settings and experience thenovelty of complete loneliness, when the normal inhibitions and customs imposedby family relationships and national standards are removed, when danger of deathis constantly faced and the larger value submerges the lesser values and theusual conventional attitudes, and when the physical organism has been trainedand brought by scientific treatment and heavy feeding to the height of physicalefficiency. I am speaking in terms of physical effectiveness and not of mentalefficiency, which may or may not parallel the former.[223] The animal instincts are therefore potent; the centres below the diaphragmbecome peculiarly energised; the emotional demands enormously vitalise the solarplexus centre, and the centre at the base of the spine increases the activity ofthe adrenal glands as the will of the man is called into play to surmountdanger; the will-to-live, with its adjunct, the will-to-perpetuate and to livein one’s children, is powerfully fostered. To this must also be added, as amajor adjunct of war, the will of Nature itself working (under certain divinelaws) to offset the loss of life and the casualties of war by a fresh inflow oflife into form, thus preserving the human race, providing the bodies for thenext tide of egos and thus peopling the earth.In saying this I seek only to explain the phenomena which can be noted at alltimes when war is present and which in the world war can be noted on a largescale. The armies of the world are everywhere and are spread over every country;racial transmigration is a universal factor, both from the angle of militarynecessity and from the plight of the civilians who find themselves in the pathof war. This movement of millions of men everywhere is one of the paramountfactors which will condition the new civilisation, and its importance is basedupon the fact that in twenty-five years’ time men and women will be a hybridrace whose fathers and mothers will be of every imaginable nation; white fatherswill have had physical relation with women of every Asiatic or African origin,thus producing a fusion of blood which—if recognised and rightly handled anddeveloped, from the educational angle and with understanding—will express inembryo the nature of the sixth rootrace, and which will be in fact HUMANITYwithout any racial or national barriers, with no so-called pure blood andexclusive castes, and with a new and virile sense of life because of theinfusion of stronger stocks with the weaker [224] or worn-out types and of thenewer racial strains with the older and more developed. I hold no brief for themanner in which this is being brought about. It could have happened without warand through a conviction that all men are equal and human, and that the mixtureof races would solve many problems; war, however, has hastened the process andthe soldiers of all the armies of the world are having physical relations withwomen of all races, all civilisations and all colours. This must, whetherregarded as right or wrong according to the code of ethics and standards of theobserver, produce an entirely new situation with which the world of the futurewill have to cope; it must inevitably break down national prejudices and racialbarriers—the first producing more effect than the latter during the initialstages. Inevitably a more homogeneous humanity will appear during the changes ofthe next one hundred years. Many attitudes and many customary reactions whichtoday hold sway will vanish, and types and qualities and characteristics forwhich we have as yet no precedent will appear upon a large scale.Whether the conservative and the so-called strictly “moral” people dislike thisworldwide happening has no bearing on the case. It has happened and is happeningdaily and will materially bring about far-reaching changes. These inter-racialand mixed relationships have always happened upon a small and individual scale;they are now happening on a large scale. For the results of this due preparationmust be made.As is well known to you, there are certain diseases which are numericallydominant in the world today. They are:1. Heart diseases of various kinds, particularly afflicting advanced humanity.2. Insanities. [225]3. Cancer, so widely prevalent among every type of man today.4. The social diseases—syphilitic in nature.5. Tuberculosis.In a subtle and occult manner, these diseases are due to two basic causes: Oneis the close interplay between people, living under modern conditions, and themassing of people into cities and towns; the other is the age of the soil uponwhich man lives (a fact little recognised or considered), for it is deeplyimpregnated with the germs and the residue incident to past ages. The immunityof man is an amazing matter, could you but realise it; he resists and throws offconstantly and continuously every kind of disease—those which are the result ofcontact with others, those which are prevalent in the very atmosphere at everytime, those which are latent within his own bodily organism, and those which areinherited and to which he has a constant predisposition. Man’s fight for healthis ceaseless and unending, ranging all the way from ordinary fatigue andtiredness (plus the universal tendency to take cold), to mortal disease, endingin death.To the trained occult observer, it is as if humanity—as a whole—is walkingpartly in a dense shadow which engulfs the race, and some part of which involvesan area of the body of every human being. One of the aims of the New Age will be“to lighten this shadow and bring people out into the fitness of true health.”This same shadow penetrates also into the mineral kingdom, affects the vegetablekingdom, and involves also the animals; it is one of the major causes of allthat can be considered under the name of “sin,” which may surprise you. It isalso the fertile seed of crime. This is a fact to be accepted, to be properlyconsidered and dealt with rationally, sanely, intelligently and [226]spiritually; it will require all the factors mentioned to lift humanity out ofthe darkness of disease into established and radiant health. Certain of theMasters are dealing with this problem in relation to the other kingdoms innature, for there will be no true escape for man whilst his environment is stillunder the shadow of disease.Much that I could tell you in this connection would sound fanciful and wouldcall forth the scoffing amusement of the hardboiled scientist. The theories heldby mankind as to the origin of diseases, and the recognition of bacteria andgerms and similar intruding organisms are largely correct, but this is so onlyif you bear in mind that they are in reality effects of causes upon which theinvestigator has not touched and which are hidden in the very history of theplanet itself and also in the racial history of the past—of which little orpractically nothing is known. Surmise and conjecture rule here.1. DISEASES OF HUMANITY, INHERITED FROM THE PASTHistory, as studied today, goes back but a little way and although theenlightened historian and scientist may extend the story of humanity to millionsof years, there is naught known about the races of men who lived those millionsof years ago; naught is known of the civilisation which flourished in earlyAtlantean times twelve million years ago; naught is known at all of the stillmore ancient Lemurian civilisation which goes back more than fifteen millionyears; still less is known of that twilight period which existed twenty-onemillion years ago when men were scarcely human and when they were so closelyrelated to the animal kingdom that we call them by the cumbersome name of“animal-man.”During the vast period between then and now, myriads of people have lived andloved and experienced; their bodies have been absorbed into the dust of theearth and [227] each has contributed something which they have gained duringlife experience—something different, however, to that which they contribute tothe life of the soul on its own plane. This something contributed has altered insome way the atoms and cells of the physical body, and that gained something hasin due time been released again into the soil of the planet. Each soul,withdrawn from the body, has come to the earth repeatedly, and many millions arehere today, particularly those who were present in later Atlantean times and whoare, therefore, the flower and the highest product of that highly emotionalrace. They bring with them the predispositions and the innate tendencies withwhich their past history has endowed them.It should therefore be borne in mind that the physical bodies in which humanitynow dwells are constructed of very ancient matter and that the substanceemployed is tainted or conditioned by the history of the past. To this conceptmust be added two others: First, that incoming souls draw to themselves the typeof material with which they must construct their outer sheaths, and that thiswill be responsive to some aspect of their subtler natures; if, for instance,physical desire conditions them, the material of their physical vehicle will belargely responsive to that particular urge. Secondly, each physical body carrieswithin itself the seeds of inevitable retribution, if its functions are misused.The great original sin in Lemurian times was sexual in nature, and due largelynot only to inherent tendencies, but to the extraordinarily dense population ofits civilisation and to the close relation of the animal kingdom. The origin ofthe syphilitic diseases traces back to these times.There is a beautiful idea in the minds of the ignorant that primitive races arefree from that type of contamination and that the many sexual diseases and theirresults are predominantly the diseases of civilisation. This is not so [228]from the occult angle of vision. True knowledge disproves it. In the infancy ofthe race, a great mismating, promiscuity and series of perversions took place,and in the language of some of the most ancient books in the Masters’ Archiveswe read: “earth took its toll and earth to earth, polluted and impure, returnedto earth; thus evil life entered the pristine cleanliness of the ancient mother.Deep in the soil the evil lies, emerging into form from time to time, and onlyfire and suffering can cleanse the mother of the evil which her children havegiven unto her.”The Lemurian race practically destroyed itself, owing to its misuse of thesacral centre, which was at that time the most active and the dominant centre.In Atlantean days it was the solar plexus centre which was the prime objectiveof the “entering fire.” The work of the Hierarchy in Lemurian days was, as Ihave told you elsewhere, to teach infant humanity the nature, meaning andsignificance of the physical vehicle, just as in the next race, the emotionalwas fostered and the major object of attention, and in our race, it is the mindwhich is subjected to stimulation. The initiate in Lemurian times was one whohad completely mastered the control of the body, and hatha-yoga was then theoutstanding spiritual practice. This, in time, was superseded by laya-yoga,which brought all the centres in the etheric body (except the throat and headcentres) into functioning activity. This is not the type of activity which isnow possible, because it must be remembered that the Master in those days hadnot the development or the understanding of the Masters of today, the onlyexceptions being Those Who had come from other schemes and spheres to aidanimal-man and primitive humanity.A. Venereal and Syphilitic Diseases.Paralleling all the activity of the Great White Lodge [229] (as was always thecase and is the case today) was the activity of the dark forces. Their effectshad to be brought about through the medium of the sacral centre, and thus a mostvicious situation came about which weakened the stamina of the human body, whichgreatly increased the demands of the sex nature through the stimulation of thesacral centre, artificially brought about by the Black Lodge, and which producedmany unholy alliances and widespread evil relations.A great new law of nature was then imposed by the planetary Logos which has beenexpressed (very inadequately) by the words, “The soul that sinneth, it shalldie.” This law could be better expressed by saying, “He that misuses that whichhe hath built will see it fall from forces within itself.”As the centuries slipped away and the Lemurian race submitted to the evilimpulses of the animal nature, gradually the earliest type of venereal diseasemade its appearance; eventually the entire race was riddled with it and diedout, nature taking its toll and exacting its inexorable price. You might hereask how these early inhabitants of our planet could be held responsible forthere is no sin where there is no sense of responsibility and no consciousnessof wrong doing. The Hierarchy in those days had its own methods of teachingthese infant peoples, just as the smallest child can be taught today to refrainfrom certain physical habits. Humanity then knew well what was evil, because theevidences of that evil were physically apparent and quite easily perceived. Thepenalty was obvious and the results immediate; the Teachers of the race saw toit that cause and effect were quickly to be noted.At this time there also arose the first tendencies to marriage, asdifferentiated from promiscuity; the formation of family units became thesubject of attention and [230] a goal for the most highly evolved. This was oneof the first tasks undertaken by the Hierarchy and the first effort toward anyform of group activity, conveying the first lesson in responsibility. The familyunit was not stable as it can be now, but even its relatively brief tenure was atremendous step forward; the segregation of the family unit and the growth ofthe sense of responsibility has gone steadily forward until it has culminated inour present system of marriage and our stress in the Occident upon monogamy; ithas led to the western pride in family strains and pedigrees, our interest ingenealogies and relationships, and the complete horror of the occidental thinkerover the syphilitic diseases as they affect families and their offspring.Two most interesting things are, however, happening today. The family unit, on aworldwide scale, is being broken up, owing to the fortunes of war and—on asmaller scale—owing to the more modern views concerning marriage and divorce.Secondly, definite and rapid cures for the sexual diseases are being discovered,and these may tend to make people more reckless. When, however, they areperfected, they will in the long run safeguard the race and will return bodiesto the soil after death freed from the plague which has contaminated the earthfor endless ages. There will thus be brought about a gradual purifying of thesoil. The growth of the practice of cremation will also aid this process ofpurification. Destruction by fire and the intensity of the heat engendered byapplied military methods are also helping, and during the next one million yearswe shall see syphilis (inherited from Lemuria) stamped out, both in the humanfamily and in the soil of the planet.As the ages passed away, humanity entered into the Atlantean stage ofdevelopment. The conscious control of the physical body dropped below thethreshold of consciousness; the etheric body became consequently more potent (a[231] fact not oft considered), and the physical body reacted increasingly likean automaton to the impression and the direction of a steadily developing desirenature. Desire became something more than simply response to animal physicalurges and to the primitive instincts, but was directed to objects and objectivesextraneous to the body, towards material possessions and towards that which(when seen and coveted) could be appropriated. Just as the major sins ofLemurian times (if they could be called sins in any true sense, because of thelow intelligence of the race) were through the misuse of sex, so the major sinof the Atlantean people was theft—widespread and general. The seeds ofaggression and of personal acquisitiveness began to show themselves, culminatingin the great war (as related in The Secret Doctrine ) between the Lords of theShining Countenance and the Lords of the Dark Face. To procure what they covetedand felt they needed, the most highly evolved of that race began to practicemagic. It is not possible for me to outline to you the nature and practices ofAtlantean magic with its control of elementals and of forms of life which havenow been driven back into retreat and are inaccessible to humanity; neither canI indicate to you the particular methods used to acquire what was desired, theWords of Power employed and the carefully planned rituals which were followed bythose who sought to enrich themselves and to take what they wanted, no matterwhat the cost to others. This magical work was the misdirected travesty of theWhite Magic so openly used in those days, prior to the great war between theForces of Light and the Forces of Evil. Magic of the right kind was veryfamiliar to the Atlantean people, and was used by those Members of the HierarchyWho were entrusted with the guidance of the race and Who were combating rampantevil in high places. That same evil is again upon the warpath and is being [232]fought by the men of goodwill, under the direction of the Great White Lodge.Heights of luxury were reached in Atlantis of which we, with all our boastedcivilisation, know nothing and have never achieved. Some faint traces of it havecome to us from legends and from ancient Egypt, from archeological discovery andold fairy tales. There was a recurrence of pure Atlantean mischief andwickedness in the decadent days of the Roman Empire. Life became tainted by themiasma of unadulterated selfishness and the very springs of life itself becamepolluted. Men only lived and breathed in order to be in possession of the utmostluxury and of a very plethora of things and of material goods. They weresmothered by desire and plagued by the dream of never dying but of living on andon, acquiring more and more of all that they desired.B. Tuberculosis .It is in this situation that we find the origin of tuberculosis. It originatedin the organs whereby men breathe and live, and was imposed—as a penalty—by theGreat White Lodge; the Masters promulgated a new law for the Atlantean peoplewhen Lemurian vice and Atlantean cupidity were at their most ruthless height.This law can be translated into the following terms: “He who lives only formaterial goods, who sacrifices all virtue in order to gain that which cannotlast, will die in life, will find breath failing him, and yet will refuse tothink of death until the summons comes.”It is difficult for us in these days to appreciate or to comprehend theAtlantean state of consciousness. There was no mental process whatsoever exceptamong the leaders of the race; there was only rampant, ruthless, insatiabledesire. This action of the Great White Lodge forced two issues and confrontedthe race with two hitherto unrealised [233] problems. The first was thatpsychological attitudes and states of consciousness can and do bring aboutphysiological conditions, these being both good and bad. Secondly, for the firsttime the people faced with recognition the phenomenon of death—death which theythemselves brought about in a new way and not just by physical means. This hadto be dramatised for them in some definitely objective manner, for as yet themasses did not respond to verbal teaching but only to visual events. When,therefore, they saw a particularly predatory and rapacious person begin tosuffer from a dire disease which seemed to arise from within himself and—whilstsuffering—hold on to his love of life (as tubercular people do today), they werefaced with another aspect or form of the original law (imposed in Lemuriantimes) which said: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Death had hithertobeen accepted without questioning as the fate of all living things, but now, forthe first time, mental relationship between individual action and death wasrecognised—as yet in a dim and feeble way—and a great step forward was made inthe human consciousness. Instinct failed to handle this situation.Death, brother of mine, is a great and universal heritage; all forms die, forsuch is the law of life, to speak in paradoxes. The time had arrived when therace could be taught the lesson that death can either be the ending of a cycleand an automatic response to the great Law of Cycles which continuallyinstitutes the new and ends the old, or it can be brought about by the misuse ofthe physical body, by misapplied energy and by the deliberate action of the manhimself. The man who deliberately sins, and who is psychologically wrong in hisattitudes and consequent actions, commits suicide just as truly as the man whodeliberately blows out his brains. This is seldom realised, but the truth willbecome increasingly apparent.[234] The Biblical injunction to remember that the sins of the fathers will bevisited upon the children is a literal statement anent the human heritage ofdisease from Lemuria and Atlantis. Syphilis and tuberculosis have beenextensively prevalent in the first half of the Aryan race, in which we now findourselves, and today they not only affect the organs of generation or the lungs(as they did in the early stages of their appearance), but now have involved theblood stream and consequently the entire organism of the human body.Much has been done in the last fifty years to bring the great Atlantean diseaseof tuberculosis under control by simplicity of living, pure and ample food andgood air. Much is being done to control, finally, the syphilitic diseases, andboth will eventually be stamped out, not only by sound treatment and thediscoveries of medical science, but because the race—as it becomes more mentallypolarised—will itself deal with the problem from the angle of commonsense, willdecide that the physical sins exact too heavy a penalty and that the possessionof that which you have not earned or needed, and which consequently is notrightfully yours, is not worth while.It is around these basic ideas that the world war (1914-1945) was fought. Wecall the unlawful possession of other people’s land, territories, goods andchattels, aggression; but this is the same thing in principle as stealing, theftand rape. Today these evils are not only individual sins and faults, but can benational characteristics; the world war has brought the whole problem to thesurface of the human consciousness and the ancient Atlantean struggle is beingbitterly waged, with the probability that this time the Great White Lodge willtriumph. That was not the case in the earlier conflict. Then the war was endedby the intervention of the planetary Logos Himself, and that [235] ancientcivilisation went down into the deeps and was engulfed in water—the symbol ofpurity, sanitation and universality, and therefore appropriate as an ending forwhat one of the Masters has called “a tubercularly oriented race.” Death bydrowning and death by obscure physical means which I am not at liberty todescribe have both been tried in the effort to salvage humanity. Today, death byfire is the applied technique, and it promises to be successful. Incontradistinction to the great Lemurian and Atlantean crises, humanity is nowfar more mentally alert, the causes of the trouble are recognised, motives areseen more clearly, and the will-to-good and to change past evil conditions isstronger than ever before. What is beginning to manifest now in the publicconsciousness is something utterly good and new.The subjective reasons given to account for the appearance of these two mostancient racial diseases may well appear to the non-esotericist as possible butnot probable and as fanciful and too general in nature. This cannot be helped.These two groups of diseases are of such exceedingly ancient origin that I havecalled them inherent in the planetary life itself and the heritage of allhumanity, for in all, the breaking of certain laws will bring about thesediseases. If I cared to do so, I could take you still further back into therealm of cosmic evil as it prevails in our solar system and affects theplanetary Logos, Who is still numbered among “the imperfect Gods.” The outerform of the planet through which He expresses Himself is impregnated to acertain depth with the seeds and germs of these two diseases; as immunity isbuilt up, however, as methods of cure are developed, as preventive medicinecomes into its own, and as man himself arrives at increasing mental and soulcontrol of the animal and desire natures, these forms of human suffering willdisappear, and (no matter what statistics [236] may say) they are disappearingamong the more controlled areas of the human family. As the life of God(expressing itself as individual divinity and universal divinity) pulsates morepowerfully through the kingdoms of nature, these two penalties of evil-doingwill inevitably no longer be required and will disappear for three reasons:1. The orientation of humanity towards the light is steadily changing and “lightdispels all evil.” The light of knowledge and the recognition of causes willbring about those carefully planned conditions which will make the syphiliticdiseases and tuberculosis things of the past.2. The centres below the diaphragm will be subjected to a cleansing, liftingprocess; the life of the sacral centre will be controlled and the energy usuallyfocussed there will be expended in creative living, through the medium of thethroat centre; the solar plexus centre will have its energy lifted to the heart,and the trend of human selfishness will then die out.3. Complete cures, implemented by science, will bring about a gradual fading outof contagion.Another reason which will bring about the cessation of those practises and modesof living and desiring which account for these diseases is one little recognisedas yet; it was referred to by the Christ when He spoke of the time when nothingsecret would remain hidden and when all secrets would be shouted aloud from thehousetops. The growth of telepathic registration and of the psychic powers suchas clairvoyance and clairaudience will eventually tend to strip humanity of theprivacy in which to sin. The powers whereby the Masters and the higher initiatescan ascertain the psychic state and physical condition of humanity, its qualityand consciousness, are already beginning to show [237] themselves in advancedhumanity. People will sin, commit evil deeds and satisfy inordinate desire, butthey will be known to their fellowmen and nothing that they do will be carriedout in secret. Some one or some group will be aware of the tendencies in thelife of a man, and even of the incidents in which he satisfies some demand ofhis lower nature, and the fact of this possibility will act as a greatdeterrent—a far greater deterrent than you can imagine. Man is indeed hisbrother’s keeper, and the keeping will take the form of knowledge and of“boycott and sanctions”—as it is called today in reference to the penalising ofnations. I would have you ponder on these two modes of treating wrong doing.They will be practically automatically applied as a matter of good taste, rightfeeling and helpful intention by individuals and groups to other individuals andgroups, and in this way crime and the tendency to evil doing will gradually bestamped out. It will be realised that all crime is founded upon some form ofdisease, or upon a glandular lack or overstimulation, based in turn upon thedevelopment or the underdevelopment of some one or other of the centres. Anenlightened public opinion—informed as to man’s constitution and aware of thegreat Law of Cause and Effect—will deal with the criminal through medical means,right environmental conditions, and the penalties of boycott and sanctions. Ihave no time to enlarge upon these matters, but these suggestions will give youfood for thought.C. Cancer.We come now to a consideration of the rapidly increasing and typical Atlanteandisease which we call cancer. We have spoken of one basic widespread diseaserelated to the physical body; we have dealt superficially with another which isa product of the desire nature. Cancer, in our [238] present cycle, the Aryan,is definitely a result of the activity of the lower concrete mind and of thestimulation of the etheric body which the mind can bring about. It is a majordisease incident to stimulation, as far as the Aryan masses are concerned, justas heart disease is also a disease of stimulation, affecting very largely theadvanced types of humanity who—through interest in business and leadership—oftensacrifice their lives and pay the penalty of misused and over-concentratedenergy by developing various forms of acute heart trouble.Disciples and initiates are prone also to suffer from this disease, owing to theawakening into violent activity of the heart centre. In the one case, the lifeenergy flowing through the heart is employed past all human tolerance inhandling human affairs; in the other, the heart centre opens up and the strainput upon the organ of the heart is too great, and heart disease supervenes. Athird cause of heart disease is due to the premature or deliberately plannedlifting of the energy of the solar plexus to the heart, thus putting anunexpected strain upon it.I am dealing naturally in broad generalisations; later evidence will go to showthe types of activity which will evoke corresponding difficulty within theheart. Heart disease will increase greatly as we enter into the new rootrace,particularly during the interim wherein the fact of the centres, their natureand qualities, is admitted and they consequently become the objective of trainedattention. Energy follows thought, and this mental focussing upon the centreswill inevitably produce overstimulation of all the centres, and this in spite ofcare and a carefully developed Science of the Centres. It is something whichcannot be avoided, owing to the nervous and uneven unfoldment of man. Later,this stimulation will be regulated and controlled, [239] and the heart will besubjected only to a general strain, along with all the other centres.Cancer is a disease most definitely related to the centres, and it will be foundthat the centre in the area wherein the cancer exists is overactive, with aconsequent increase of energy pouring through the related bodily substance. Thisenergy and the overstimulation of a centre can be due not only to the activityof the centre and its consequent radiation, but also the suppression imposed bythe mind upon any activity of a particular centre. This brings about a dammingup of energy, and again we have the creation of too much concentrated energy inany particular area. One of the main sources of cancer as related to the sacralcentre, and therefore to the sex organs, has been the well-intentionedsuppression of the sex life, and of all thought connected with the sex life, bymisguided aspirants; they are those who find the teaching—monastic andcelibate—of the Middle Ages the line of least resistance. In that period oftime, good people taught that sex was evil and wicked, something not to bementioned, and a potent source of trouble. Normal reactions, instead of beingcontrolled and transmuted into creative activity, were violently suppressed andall thoughts anent the sex life were refused expression. Nevertheless, energyfollows the direction of thought, with the result that that particularlymagnetic type of energy attracted an increasing number of cells and atoms toitself; therein is found the source of the tumours, growths and cancers soprevalent today. The same thing can be said about the violent inhibition imposedby an aspirant upon all emotional reactions and feelings. In their effort tocontrol the astral body, these people resort to a process of direct inhibitionand suppression. That suppression makes of the solar plexus centre a greatreservoir of drastically retained energy. Transmutation of the emotions intoaspiration and love and directed [240] control is not present, and the existenceof this vibrant reservoir of power brings about cancer of the stomach, of theliver, and sometimes of the entire area of the abdomen. I simply mention thesecauses (overactivity of a centre and the retention of energy, unexpressed andinhibited) as fruitful sources of cancer.We come back in every case, as you can see, to the fact of the existence of thecentres and their physiological effects. So much emphasis has been laid upon thequalities and characteristics which man will develop when the centres are allproperly organised and directed, that the effects of the energy which theyreceive and distribute into the physical organism have been largely overlooked.Two factors in connection with the centres and the blood stream thereforewarrant repetition and attention:1. The blood stream is the agent of the glandular system as it, in its turn, isan effect of the centres; the blood stream carries to every part of the bodythose essential elements of which we know so little and which are responsiblefor making man psychologically what he is, and thus physically control hisequipment.2. The blood stream is also the life, and carries throughout the organism anaspect of the energy stored up by the centres which is not directly related tothe endocrine system; it penetrates, by its radiation, into the blood stream andinto all the veins, arteries and capillaries within the area controlled by thecentre under consideration. This permeating energy of life itself, localised andqualified, can be either life-giving or death bestowing.All diseases—except those due to accidents, wounds resulting in infections, andepidemics—can in the last analysis be [241] traced to some condition of thecentres, and therefore to energy running wild, to energy overactive andmisdirected or insufficient and lacking altogether, or retained instead of usedand transmuted into a higher corresponding centre of energy. The mystery of theblood still remains to be solved, and will receive increasing attention as timegoes on. The anemias, so prevalent today, are also due to excess of energy.I can only lay down general indications, state causes, and then leave to theintelligent investigators the task of studying effects, after accepting as apossible hypothesis the suggestions I have made. A proper study of the ductlessglands (and later of the entire glandular structure of the body) and of theblood stream will establish them as the paramount source of physical difficulty;inevitably, though slowly and patiently, the investigators will be forced backupon the centres and will come to include in their calculations a subjectivenervous system (the entire subjective system of nadis which underlie the nervesthroughout the body), and will demonstrate that these factors are responsiblefor the major diseases and the many subsidiary diseases and obscure complaintswhich plague humanity. The open-minded investigator, however, who starts with anacceptance of the fact of the centres, regarding them as possibly present andeventually capable of demonstration, will make far more rapid progress; diseaseswill then be brought under control by a system of laya-yoga (the science of thecentres) which will be the sublimated form of the laya-yoga of Atlantean days.Then the advanced student will control the centres by the power of thought. Inthe yoga of the future, through meditation and alignment and right practices,the centres will be brought under the direct control of the soul—a verydifferent thing to the control of the centres by the mind and one for which themasses of men are not yet ready. To this the [242] Science of the Breath will beadded—not breathing exercises as now taught, with often such dangerous results,but a breathing rhythm imposed by the mind through which the soul can work, andwhich will not require anything more than the simple rhythmic physical breathbut which will reorganise the subtler bodies and bring the centres into orderedactivity, according to ray and point in evolution.I deal not with the pathology of these diseases. That has been well consideredand dealt with by ordinary medicine. I seek only in this part of our discussionsto emphasise the subjective causes and the objective effects. The two must berelated. The activity—excessive or inadequate—of the centres is the subjectivecause, but remains yet unrecognised except by esotericists. The causes (theapparent causes which are themselves the result of a true subjective cause) areinitiated by the physical man himself, either in this life or an earlier one—apoint which we will discuss later.I have given you in the above much to consider, and as you ponder and think, asyou study cases and types, as you watch the characteristics and qualities ofthose you know and which work out in some form of eventual disease, light willcome.It is only the necessity of indicating the major sources of diseases and notoverlooking them, even if the subject is too esoteric for the averageintelligence to grasp, that has led me to include our second point:2. DISEASES ARISING FROM OBSCURE PLANETARY CONDITIONSIt is obviously impossible for me to enlarge upon this subject, for it is notpossible to give even a slight indication which could lead, at present, to anyprocess of verification. What I say will have to be taken on trust and isdependent upon what I believe is recognised as my proved veracity and [243]integrity. I shall, and can, say but little—only enough to indicate one fruitfulcause of disease and one of such great age that it is inherent in the life ofthe planet itself. These diseases have no subjective or subtle origin; they arenot the result of emotional conditions or of undesirable mental processes. Theyare not psychological in nature and therefore cannot be traced to any activityof the centres. They originate from within the planetary life itself and fromits life aspect, having a direct emanatory effect upon the individual atoms ofwhich the dense physical body is composed. This is a point of importance toremember. The source of any disease of this nature induced by the planet itself,is due primarily, therefore, to an external impact of certain vibratoryemanations coming from the surface of the planet, engendered deep within theplanet, and impinging upon the dense physical body. These radiations play uponthe units of energy which, in their totality, constitute the atomic substance ofthe body; they are unconnected in any way with the blood stream or with thenervous system. They are consequently impossible to trace or isolate, becauseman is today so highly organised and integrated that these external impactsimmediately evoke a response from the nervous system; the modern physician is atpresent unable to distinguish between the diseases arising from within thepatient’s own interior mechanism—tangible or intangible—and those which are inthe nature of extraneous irritants, producing immediate effects upon thesensitive organism of man’s body. I am not here referring to infectious orcontagious difficulties.Perhaps one point which I might helpfully emphasise is that it is this obscureplanetary effect (obscure to us, at this time) upon the physical body which isthe major cause of death where the purely animal form nature is concerned, orthe forms of life present in the animal and vegetable [244] kingdoms, and to alesser and slower degree in the mineral kingdom likewise. Death, as far as thehuman being is concerned, is increasingly due to the planned intent and plannedwithdrawal of the soul, under the pressure of its own formulated intent. This istrue to some degree of all who die, except those who are of so low a grade ofintelligence that the soul is practically little more than an overshadowingagency. Of all who die, highly developed or not, the later stages ofdissolution, effective after the conscious withdrawal of the soul (conscious onthe part of the soul and becoming increasingly conscious on the part of thedying person), are taken over by this death-bestowing power of the planetarylife itself.In the case of the subhuman kingdoms in nature, death is the direct result ofthis obscure activity of the planet. The only idea as to its functioning which Ican give you is that the soul of all non-human forms of life is an inherentaspect of the substance of which the planet is itself constructed; this soul canbe withdrawn according to cycles, undetermined yet by science but fixed andcertain in their working—apart from great planetary accidents or the directaction of the fourth kingdom in nature. This innate planetary power leads to thedeath of an animal and—in the larger sweep of evolution—to the extinction of aspecies; it leads also in time to the death of the forms of the vegetablekingdom and is also one of the causes which leads to the autumnal cycle in theyear, producing the “sere, the yellow leaf,” the loss of verdure in the grass,and those cyclic manifestations which indicate not alone death, upon a temporaryand passing scale, but the complete cessation of vitality within a form. “Timesof perishing” are cyclic manifestations of the “destroyer aspect” within theplanet itself. These are necessarily difficult matters for you to grasp.[245] This radiatory activity of the planetary life, cyclic in nature andeternally present, is closely related to the influence of the first ray. It isthat aspect of the Ray of Will or Power which produces the dissolution of theform, and the corruption and dissipation of the bodily vehicle until it has beenagain completely reabsorbed into the substance of the planet. A focussed use ofthe imagination will aid you in discovering how vitally constructive this agencyof divinity can be. Death has been present upon our planet from the very nightof time itself; forms have come and gone; death has overtaken plants and trees,animals and the forms of human beings for untold aeons, and yet our planet isnot a charnel house as it well might be in the face of this fact, but is still athing of beauty, unspoilt even by man. The processes of dying and of dissolutionand the dissipation of forms goes on every moment without producing contagiouscontamination or the disfiguring of the surface of the earth. The results ofdissolution are beneficent in effect. Ponder on this beneficent activity and onthe beauty of the divine plan of death and disappearance.With man, death takes on two aspects of activity; the human soul differs fromthe soul in the non-human forms in that it is itself a full and—on its ownplane—an effective expression of the three divine aspects; it determines withincertain limits—based on time conditions and spatial necessity—its entrance intohuman form and its exit therefrom. Once this exit has been made and the soul haswithdrawn the thread of consciousness from the brain and its life thread fromthe heart, certain life processes still persist; they are now under theinfluence of the planetary life, however, and to these the physical elemental(the sumtotal of the living atoms of the body nature) is responsive. I wouldhave you note the occult paradox that death is the result of living processes.Death, or the death-producing energy emanating [246] from the planet, bringsabout the complete disruption of the bodily organism and its reduction to itsessential elements—chemical and mineral, plus certain inorganic substances whichare susceptible of absorption into the soil of the planet itself. Death, as theresult of soul activity produces, therefore, the withdrawing from the body ofthe “light body and of the subtle bodies,” leaving the dense form and itscomponent parts to the benign processes of planetary control. This dual activityproduces death—as we know it from the human angle.It is necessary here to point out that this ability of the planetary Logos toextract the life essence innate in each atom, produces what might be calleddeterioration in the structure of the form at any point from whence this lifeessence is emitted. This brings about conditions which eventually becomeapparent visually; thus disease and the “tendency to die” become recognisable.Therefore, the withering of a flower, death from old age in an animal or a tree,and the many diseases of the human being are all brought about by the pull ofthe powerful life of the planet, speaking esoterically; this is an aspect ofwhat is called, erroneously, the Law of Gravitation. This law is—again speakingesoterically—an aspect of the Law of Return, which governs the relation of aunit of life in form to its emanating source. “Dust thou art; unto dust thoushalt return” is a statement of occult law. In the curious evolution of words—asany good dictionary will show—the word “dust” comes from two roots, one meaning“wind” and the other “falling to pieces.” The significance of both thesemeanings will be apparent and the sequence of ideas is arresting. With thewithdrawing of the wind or breath, a falling to pieces eventuates, and this is atrue and significant statement. As the greater life absorbs the lesser life, thedisappearance of that which the life has informed takes place; this is true ofall forms in the [247] subhuman kingdoms as they respond to the drag or pull ofthe planetary life; it is true also of the human form as it reacts to the callof the soul to return its life principle to the soul, via the sutratma, and toreturn as consciousness to its registering source.In this process and interaction, the form shows the results of being either thereceiver of the tide of life from the planet or as the releaser of that life,under cyclic law, to its general reservoir of living energy. Upon these tworeactions depends the health or the disease of the form in various stages andstates of response and under the action of other contributing and conditioningfactors. There are three major stages in the life cycle of all subhuman forms,and in the human form likewise when the soul is simply an overshadowing forceand not an integrated energy:1. The stage of inflowing , of vitalisation and of growth.2. The stage of resistance , wherein the form preserves its own integrity for atemporary cycle, determined by its species and environment, thus resistingsuccessfully any “pull” of the all-enveloping life and any reabsorption of itsvitality.3. The stage of emission , wherein the pull of the greater life of the planetdraws out and absorbs the weakening lesser life. This weakening process is apart of a cyclic law, as the old adage “the days of a man are three score yearsand ten” hints. When the average of a general cyclic period is normally run, apoint of weakening in the bodily tissue will surely and gradually arise. Diseaseor deterioration of some part of the form usually eventuates and deathsupervenes. The length of the cycles and their determining cause are a deepmystery and are specifically related to the various kingdoms in nature, and tothe species and types and forms within those [248] aggregates of livingprocesses. These cycles are known as yet only to the Masters and to thoseinitiates to whom is given the task of promoting the evolutionary process withinthe subhuman kingdoms, and to the devas whose task it is to control the process.As you well know, the great distinction between the human kingdom in the threeworlds and the other kingdoms in nature is the factor of freewill. In the matterof death, this freewill has, in the last analysis, a definite relation to thesoul; the will of the soul is either consciously or unconsciously followed,where the decision of death is concerned, and this idea carries with it manyimplications which students would do well to ponder.We have arrived now at another major generalisation as to disease and death inrelation to humanity:LAW VIIIDisease and death are the result of two active forces. One is the will of thesoul which says to its instrument: I draw the essence back. Tire other is themagnetic power of the planetary Life which says to the life within the atomicstructure: The hour of reabsorption has arrived. Return to me. Thus, undercyclic law, do all forms act.The reference here is to the normal dissolution of the form at the close of acycle of reincarnation. As we well know. this cycle is determined in the case ofman by major psychological factors which can hasten or prolong the “hour of theend,” but only up to a certain point. The dictum of the soul and the fiat of theplanetary Life are the final determining factors, except in the cases of war,accident, suicide or epidemics.The power of absorption with which the planet is endowed is very great withincertain limitations; it is these limitations, [249] for instance, which promoteepidemics as the aftermath of war. Such epidemics have a serious effect upon thehuman race after the war cycle is over and after the consequent epidemic hasspent itself. Humanity, particularly in Eastern Europe, had not completelyrecovered from the epidemics, incident to the first part of the world war, whenthe second part took place. The psychological effects continue; the scars andthe results of the second phase of that world war will persist for fifty years,even though—owing to man’s greater scientific knowledge—the epidemic factor maybe kept surprisingly within bounds. This, however, still remains uncertain. Timealone will demonstrate how successful humanity is in offsetting the penaltieswhich outraged nature is apt to exact.Much good will be brought about through the growing custom to cremate thoseforms which the indwelling life has vacated; when it is an universal custom, weshall see a definite minimising of disease, leading to longevity and increasedvitality. The factor of resistance or the process whereby a form renders itselfimmune or non-responsive to the planetary pull and urge towards reabsorptionrequires the expenditure of much energy. When the life increases in potencywithin the form and there is less reaction to disease-conveying factors, thesoul within the form will have fuller sway and greater beauty of expression andusefulness in service. This will be true some day of all the kingdoms in nature,and thus we shall have a steady radiance shining forth in the mounting glory ofthe Life of God.3. RACIAL AND NATIONAL DISEASESIt must be apparent to you by now that I am principally concerned withindicating factors which are the result of the past history of the race ratherthan with giving you a specific and detailed account of the diseases which areallied [250] to the various nations. This, in fact, it would not be possible todo, owing to the overlapping and paralleling which goes on in every departmentof natural life. Above everything else, I seek to make clear what must be donealong the line of preventive healing and what should be accomplished in thedifficult task of offsetting conditions already prevalent on earth as the resultof past misuse of the natural powers . There must therefore be brought about ahealing of those conditions which are present upon our planet on a large scale,and consequently my emphasis will not be upon the specific and the individual. Iam laying a foundation also for a discussion of our next theme—the relation ofthe Law of Karma to disease and death and to humanity as a whole.In the consideration of racial and national diseases, I do not intend to pointout that tuberculosis is distinctively a disease of the middle classes in everycountry, that diabetes is a major trouble among the rice-eating peoples of theworld, and that cancer is rampant in Great Britain, whilst heart disease is aprime cause of death in the United States. Such generalisations are both as trueand as false as statistics usually are, and nothing is gained by labouring thesepoints. These difficulties will all be offset in due time through the growth ofunderstanding, by the intuitive diagnosis of disease, and by the magnificentwork of scientific and academic medicine, plus a truer comprehension of rightliving conditions.I prefer rather to give still wider generalisations which will indicate causesand will not emphasise the consequences of these causes. I seek, therefore, topoint out that:1. The soil of the planet itself is a major cause of disease and ofcontamination. For untold aeons, the bodies of men and of animals have been laidaway in the ground; that soil is consequently impregnated with the germs and[251] the results of disease and this in a far subtler form than is surmised.The germs of ancient known and unknown diseases are to be found in the layers ofthe soil and the subsoil; these can still produce virulent trouble if presentedwith proper conditions. Let me state that Nature never intended that bodieswould be buried in the ground. The animals die and their bodies return to thedust, but return purified by the rays of the sun and by the breezes which blowand disperse. The sun can cause death as well as life, and the most virulentgerms and bacteria cannot retain their potency if submitted to the dry heat ofthe sun’s rays. Moisture and darkness foster disease as it emanates from and isnourished by bodies from whence the life aspect has been drawn. When, in allcountries throughout the world, the rule is to submit dead forms to the “ordealby fire,” and when this has become a universal and persistent habit, we shallthen see a great diminution of disease and a much healthier world.2. The psychological condition of a race or of a nation, as we have seen,produces a tendency to disease and to a lowered resistance to the causes ofdisease; it can engender an ability to absorb evil contamination with facility.On this I need not further enlarge.3. Living conditions in many lands also foster disease and ill health. Dark andcrowded tenements, underground homes, undernourishment, wrong food, evil habitsof life and various occupational diseases—all contribute their quota to thegeneral ill health of humanity. These conditions are universally recognised andmuch has been done to offset them, but much remains to be done. One of the goodeffects of the world war will be to force the needed changes, the requiredrebuilding, and the scientific nourishment of the youth of the race. Nationalphysical [252] ills vary according to the predisposing occupations of thepeople; the diseases of an agricultural race will differ widely from those of ahighly industrialised race; the physical predispositions of a sailor varygreatly from those of an office worker in one of our large cities. These itemsof information are again but the platitudes of the social worker in the manycities and lands. Certain diseases appear to be purely local; others seemuniversal in their effects; certain diseases are gradually dying out, and newdiseases are appearing; certain forms of disease are forever with us; othersseem to be cyclic in their appearance; some diseases are endemic whilst othersare epidemic.How can this vast array of disease and forms of bodily ills come to be? How isit that some races are prone to succumb to one form of physical ill whilst otherraces are resistant to it? Climatic conditions produce certain typical diseaseswhich remain strictly local and are not found elsewhere in the world. Cancer,tuberculosis, syphilis, spinal meningitis, pneumonia and heart disease, as wellas scrofula (using that term in its old sense to indicate certain forms of skindisease), are rampant throughout the world, taking their toll of millions; eventhough these diseases can be traced to certain great racial periods, they arenow general in their effect. The clue to this can be found if students willremember that though the Atlantean racial period lies thousands of years away, agreat majority of people today are basically Atlantean in their consciousness,and are therefore prone to the diseases of that civilisation.If a full review of the health of the world were to be undertaken and presentedto the thinking public—taken in normal conditions and not in war time—thequestion arises whether there are one hundred thousand perfectly healthy [253]people to be found out of the billions now inhabiting the earth? I think not. Ifno actual and active disease is present, nevertheless the condition of theteeth, the hearing and the sight leave frequently much to be desired; inheritedtendencies and active predispositions cause grave concern, and to all this mustbe added psychological difficulty, mental diseases and definite brain trouble.All this presents an appalling picture. Against the ills which it discloses,medicine is today battling; scientists are searching for alleviations and curesand for sound and lasting methods of eradication; research students areinvestigating the latent germs, and health experts are seeking new ways to meetthe onslaught of disease. Sanitation, compulsory inoculation, frequentinspection, pure food laws, legal requirements and better housing conditions areall brought into this battle by the far-seeing humanitarian. Yet still diseaseis rampant; more hospitals are required and the death rate soars.To these practical agencies, Mental Science, New Thought, Unity and ChristianScience offer their aid, and seek quite honestly to bring the power of the mindto bear upon the problem. At the present stage, these agencies and groupslargely are in the hands of fanatics and devoted, unintelligent people; theyrefuse all compromise and seem unable to recognise that the knowledgeaccumulated by medicine and by those who work scientifically with the human bodyis as God-given as their, as yet, unprovedideal. Later, the truths for whichthese groups stand will be added to the work of the psychologist and thephysician; when this has been done, we shall see a great improvement. When thework of the doctor and the surgeon in relation to the physical body isrecognised as essential and good, when the analysis and conclusions of thepsychologist supplement their work, and when the power of right thought comeslikewise as an [254] aid, then and only then, shall we enter upon a new era ofwell-being.To the various categories of trouble must also be added a whole group ofdiseases which are more strictly mental in their effect—the cleavages, theinsanities, the obsessions, the mental breaks, the aberrations and thehallucinations. To the various healing agencies mentioned above should be addedthe work undertaken by Members of the spiritual Hierarchy and Their disciples;it takes soul power and knowledge, plus the wisdom of the other healing groups,to produce health among people, to empty our sanatariums, to rid humanity of thebasic diseases, of lunacy and obsession, and to prevent crime. This is finallybrought about by the right integration of the whole man, through a rightcomprehension of the nature of energy, and through a correct appreciation of theendocrine system, its glands and their subtle relationships.At present there is little coherent and integrated work done in unison by thefour groups:1. Physicians and surgeons—orthodox and academic.2. Psychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists.3. Mental healers and New Thought workers, plus Unity thinkers and ChristianScientists.4. Trained disciples and those who work with the souls of men.When these four groups can be brought into close relation, and can work togetherfor the release of humanity from disease, we shall then arrive at anunderstanding of the true wonder of the human being. We shall some day havehospitals in which the four phases of this one medical and remedial work willproceed side by side and in the fullest cooperation. Neither group can do acomplete task without the others; all are interdependent.[255] It is the inability of these groups to recognise the good in the othergroups striving for the physical well-being of humanity which makes it almostimpossible for me to do more specific teaching and more direct talking on thesematters. Have you any idea of the wall of antagonistic thinking and speechagainst which a new or pioneering idea has to batter itself? Have you everseriously considered the aggregated and crystallised thoughtforms with which allsuch new ideas (and shall I call them hierarchical proposals) have to contend?Do you appreciate the dead weight of preconceived and ancient determinationswhich have to be moved before the Hierarchy can cause a new and needed conceptto penetrate into the consciousness of the average thinking (or again should Isay, unthinking?) public. The field of medicine is a most difficult field inwhich to work, for the subject is so intimate, and fear enters so strongly intothe reactions of those who must be reached. The gulf between the old andestablished and the new and the spiritually demanded, needs much long andcareful bridging. A great deal of the difficulty is, curiously enough, to befound fostered by the newer schools of thought. Orthodox medicine is slow, andrightly slow, in adopting new techniques and methods; it is at times too slow,but the case of the new mode of treatment or diagnosis must be rightly provenand statistically proven before it can be incorporated in the medical curriculumand method; the risks to the human subject are too great, and the goodhumanitarian physician will not make his patient the subject of experimentation.However, within the last few decades, medicine has advanced by leaps and bounds,the science of electricity and light therapy and many other modern techniquesand methods have already been added to the various other sciences of whichmedicine avails itself. The demands of the intangible and the treatment of thenebulous—if such [256] peculiar terms are in order—are being recognisedincreasingly and are known to play an orthodox and recognised part in the newerapproaches to disease.The approach of the mental schools and cults, as they erroneously callthemselves, has not proceeded so helpfully. This is largely their fault. Schoolsof thought such as Mental Science, New Thought, Unity, Christian Science,Chiropractic enterprise, the efforts of the Naturopaths and many others, hurttheir cause, owing to the large claims which they make and to their unceasingattacks upon orthodox medicine and other channels of proven helpfulness and uponthe knowledge (acquired over centuries of experimentation) of the academicschools of medicine and surgery. They forget that many of their claims tosuccess (and they are often irrefutable) can be classed under the generalheading of faith cures, and this can be done correctly or incorrectly. Suchcures have long been recognised by the academic thinker and known to be factual.These cults which are in fact the custodians of needed truths, need aboveeverything else to change their approach and to learn the spiritual nature ofcompromise in these days of evolutionary unfoldment. Their ideas cannot comeinto full and desired usefulness apart from the already God-given knowledgewhich medicine down the ages has accumulated; they need also to keep a record oftheir numerous failures, as well as the successes which they loudly proclaim. Iwould here point out that these successes are in no way so numerous as those oforthodox medicine and of the beneficent work done by the clinics of ourhospitals which—in spite of failures and often gross stupidity—greatlyameliorate the pains and ills of the masses of men. These cults omit to state,or even to recognise, that in cases of extreme illness or accident, the patientis physically unable to affirm or claim divine healing and is dependent upon thework of some healer who works with no knowledge [257] of the karma of thepatient. Many of their so-called cures (and this is the case also with orthodoxmedicine) are cures because the hour of the end has not yet arrived for thepatient and he would have recovered in any case, though he often does so morerapidly, owing to the remedial measures of the trained physician.In cases of serious accident, where the injured person will bleed, the cultist(no matter what his cult may be called) will perforce avail himself of themethods of the orthodox physician; he will apply a tourniquet, for instance, andtake the measures which orthodox medicine enjoins, rather than stand by and seethe injured person die because these methods are not used. When he is face toface with death, he will frequently turn to the tried and proved methods of helpand will usually call in a physician rather than be charged with murder.All the above is said in no spirit of disparagement, but in an effort to provethat the many schools of thought—orthodox, academic, ancient, material orspiritual, new, pioneering or mental—are interdependent; they need to be broughttogether into one great healing science. This will be a science which will healthe whole man and bring into play all the resources—physical, emotional, mentaland spiritual—of which humanity is capable. Orthodox medicine is more open tocooperation with the newer cults than are the neophytes of the science of mentalcontrol of disease; they cannot, however, permit their patients to be turnedinto guinea pigs (is not that the term used in these cases, brother of mine?)for the satisfaction of the pioneering cultist and the proving of histheories—no matter how correct when applied in conjunction with what has alreadybeen proved. The middle way of compromise and of mutual cooperation is ever thewisest. and this is a lesson much needed today in every department of humanthinking.[258] We shall now proceed to deal with our third and final section of thoughtsaround the basic causes of disease. The theme of karma has been littleconsidered and I shall deal with it in a way larger than our particular subjectperhaps warrants."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III - OUR KARMIC LIABILITIESINTRODUCTORY REMARKS[259] We have reached now the concluding phase of our approach to the problem ofdisease. In our next part we shall deal with the attitudes and temperaments ofthe patient, taking into consideration his ray and also the state of mind of thehealer; all these points are of prime importance when one comes to theconsideration of the fine art of healing. It is, however, essential that illhealth, acute disease, and death itself should find their place in the overallpicture. A particular incarnation is not an isolated event in the life of thesoul, but is a part and an aspect of a sequence of experiences which areintended to lead to one, clear, definite goal—the goal of free choice and adeliberate return out of matter to spirit and eventual liberation.There has been much talk among esotericists (particularly in the Easternpresentation of the Path to Reality) anent liberation. The goal held before theneophyte is liberation, freedom, emancipation; this, by and large, is thekeynote of life itself. The concept is a transitting out of the realm of thepurely selfish and of personal liberation into something much wider and moreimportant. This concept of liberation lies behind the modern use of the word“liberty” but is far wiser, better and deeper in its connotation. Liberty, inthe minds of many, is freedom from the imposition of any man’s [260] rule,freedom to do as one wishes, to think as one determines and to live as onechooses. This is as it should be, provided that one’s wishes, choices, thoughtsand desires are free from selfishness and are dedicated to the good of thewhole. This is, as yet, very seldom so.Liberation is much more than all this; it is freedom from the past, freedom tomove forward along certain predetermined lines (predetermined by the soul),freedom to express all the divinity of which one is capable as an individual, orwhich a nation can present to the world.There have been in the history of the past two thousand years, four greatsymbolic happenings which have sequentially presented (to those who have eyes tosee, ears to hear and minds to interpret) the theme of liberation—and not simplyof liberty.1. The life of Christ Himself. He, for the first time, presented the idea of thesacrifice of the unit, consciously and deliberately offered for the service ofthe whole. There had been other World Saviours, but the issues involved had notso clearly been expressed, because the mind of man had not been ready to graspthe implications. Service is the keynote of liberation. Christ was the idealServer.2. The signing of the Magna Charta. This document was signed at Runnymede,during the reign of King John on June 15th, 1215, A.D. Here the idea ofliberation from authority was presented with the emphasis upon the personalliberty and rights of the individual. The growth and development of this basicidea, mental concept and formulated perception falls into four phases orchapters:a. The signing of the Magna Charta, emphasising personal liberty.[261]b. The founding of the French Republic with its emphasis upon human liberty.c. The Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, determining nationalpolicy.d. The Atlantic Charter and the Four Freedoms, bringing the whole question intothe international field, and guaranteeing to men and women everywhere in theworld liberty and freedom to develop the divine reality within themselves.The ideal has gradually become clarified so that today the mass of meneverywhere know what are the basic essentials of happiness.3. The Emancipation of the Slaves . The spiritual idea of human liberty, whichhad become a recognised ideal, became a demanding desire, and a great symbolichappening took place—the slaves were freed. Like all things which human beingsenact, perfection is nonexistent. The Negro is not free in this land of thefree, and America will have to clean house in this respect; to put it in clearconcise words, the U.S.A. must see to it that the Constitution and the Bill ofRights are facts and not a dream. Only thus can the inevitable working of theLaw of Karma (which is our theme today) be offset. The Negroes are Americans, aswell as the New Englanders and all other stocks which are not indigenous in thiscountry, and the Constitution is theirs also. As yet the privileges it confersare withheld by those who are the slaves of selfishness and fear.4. The Liberation of Humanity by the United Nations. We are participating in agreat spectacular and symbolic happening and are watching it in process. Theliberation of the individual has moved onward through the symbolic liberation ofa section of humanity (the remnants [262] of the first two races, the Lemurianand the Atlantean) to the liberation of millions of human beings, enslaved bythe forces of evil, by millions of their fellow men. The ideal has workedthrough into a practical worldwide effort upon the physical plane and hasdemanded worldwide sacrifice. It has involved the entire three worlds of humanevolution, and for this reason the Christ can now lead His forces and aid humanbeings to liberate mankind.What has really been happening, therefore, in the lives of individuals, in thelives of nations and in the life of humanity? A tremendous move to put rightmost ancient evil, to offset consciously the Law of Cause and Effect by arecognition of the causes in the personal, national and international worldswhich have produced the effects under which humanity today suffers.The Law of Karma is today a great and incontrovertible fact in the consciousnessof humanity everywhere. They may not call it by that name, but they are wellaware that in all today’s events the nations are reaping what they sowed. Thisgreat law—at one time a theory—is not a proven fact and a recognised factor inhuman thinking. The question “Why?” so frequently asked brings in the factor ofcause and effect with constant inevitability. The concepts of heredity and ofenvironment are efforts to explain existing human conditions; qualities, racialcharacteristics, national temperaments and ideals prove the fact of someinitiating world of causes. Historical conditions, the relationships betweennations, social taboos, religious convictions and tendencies can all be tracedto originating causes—some of them most ancient. Everything that is happening inthe world today and which is so potently affecting humanity—things of beauty andof horror, modes of living [263] and civilisation and culture, prejudices andlikings, scientific attainment and artistic expression and the many ways inwhich humanity throughout the planet colours existence—are aspects of effects,initiated somewhere, on some level at some time, by human beings, bothindividually and en masse.Karma is therefore that which Man—the Heavenly Man in whom we live, humanity asa whole, mankind in groups as nations, and individual man—has instituted,carried forward, endorsed, omitted to do or has done right through the agesuntil the present moment. Today, the harvest is ripe and mankind is reaping whatit has sown, preparatory to a fresh ploughing in the springtime of the New Age,with a fresh sowing of the seed which will (let us pray and hope) produce abetter harvest.The outstanding evidence of the Law of Cause and Effect is the Jewish race. Allnations prove this Law , but I choose to refer to the Hebrew peoples becausetheir history is so well known and their future and their destiny are subjectsof worldwide, universal concern. The Jews have always had a symbolicsignificance; they sum up in themselves—as a nation, down the ages—the depths ofhuman evil and the heights of human divinity. Their aggressive history asnarrated in the Old Testament is on a par with present-day Germanaccomplishment; yet Christ was a Jew and it was the Hebrew race which producedHim. Let this never be forgotten. The Jews were great aggressors; they despoiledthe Egyptians and they took the Promised Land at the point of the sword, sparingneither man, woman nor child. Their religious history has been built around amaterialistic Jehovah, possessive, greedy and endorsing and encouragingaggression. Their history is symbolic of the history of all aggressors,rationalising themselves into the belief that they are carrying out divinepurpose, wresting away from people their property in a spirit of self-defenseand finding some [264] reason, adequate to them, to excuse the iniquity of theiraction. Palestine was taken by the Jews because it was “a land flowing with milkand honey,” and the claim was made that the act was undertaken in obedience todivine command. Later, the symbolism gets most interesting. They divided intotwo halves: the Israelites with headquarters at Samaria, and the Jews (meaningtwo or three special tribes out of the twelve) locating around Jerusalem.Dualism ran through their religious beliefs; they were schooled by the Sadduceesor the Pharisees, and these two groups were in constant conflict. Christ came asa member of the Jewish race and they renounced Him.Today the law is working, and the Jews are paying the price, factually andsymbolically, for all they have done in the past. They are demonstrating thefar-reaching effects of the Law. Factually and symbolically, they stand forculture and civilisation; factually and symbolically, they are humanity;factually and symbolically, they stand as they have ever chosen to stand, forseparation. They regard themselves as the chosen people and have an innateconsciousness of that high destiny, forgetting their symbolic role and that itis Humanity which is the chosen people and not one small and unimportantfraction of the race. Factually and symbolically, they long for unity andcooperation, yet know not how to cooperate; factually and symbolically, they arethe “Eternal Pilgrim”; they are mankind, wandering through the mazes of thethree worlds of human evolution, and gazing with longing eyes towards a promisedland; factually and symbolically, they resemble the mass of men, refusing tocomprehend the underlying spiritual purpose of all material phenomena, rejectingthe Christ within (as they did centuries ago the Christ within their borders),grasping for material good and steadily rejecting the things of the spirit. Theydemand the so-called restitution of Palestine, [265] wresting it away from thosewho have inhabited it for many centuries; and by their continued emphasis uponmaterial possession they lose sight of the true solution, which is that,symbolically and factually again, they must be assimilated into all the nations,and fused with all the races, thus demonstrating recognition of the OneHumanity.It is interesting to note that the Jews who inhabited southern Palestine, andwhose chief city was Jerusalem, have succeeded in doing this and have fused withand been assimilated by the British, the Dutch and the French in a way that theIsraelites, ruled from Samaria, have never done. I commend this to you for yourconsideration.If the Jewish race would recall, therefore, their high symbolic destiny, and ifthe rest of humanity would see themselves in the Jewish people, and if bothgroups would emphasise the fact of human stock and cease thinking of themselvesin terms of national and racial units, the karma of humanity would radicallychange from the retributive karma of the present to the recompensing good karmaof the future.Regarding this question from the long range vision (looking backwardhistorically as well as forward hopefully), the problem is one to which the Jewsthemselves must make the larger contribution. They have never yet faced candidlyand honestly (as a race) the problem of why the many nations, from the time ofthe Egyptians, have neither liked nor wanted them. It has always been the samedown the centuries. Yet there must be some reason, inherent in the peoplethemselves, when the reaction is so general and universal. Their approach totheir direful problem has been one of supplication, or of distressed complaint,or of unhappy despair. Their demand has been for the Gentile nations to put thematter right, and many Gentiles have attempted to do so. Until, however, theJews themselves [266] face up to the situation and admit that there may be forthem the working out of the retributive aspect of the Law of Cause and Effect,and until they endeavour to ascertain what it is in them, as a race, which hasinitiated their ancient and dire fate, this basic world issue will remain as ithas been since the very night of time. That within the race there are and havebeen great, good, just and spiritual men is unalterably true. A generalisationis never a complete expression of the truth. But, viewing the problem of theJews in time and space, in history and today, the points which I have made willbear careful consideration by the Jews.What I have said in no way mitigates the guilt of those who have so sorelyabused the Jews. You have a proverb, have you not? that “two blacks do not makea white.” The behaviour of the nations towards the Jews, culminating in theatrocities of the second quarter of the twentieth century, have no excuse. Thelaw must inevitably work. Though much that has happened to the Jews originatedin their past history and in their pronounced attitude of separativeness andnonassimilability, and in their emphasis upon material good, yet the agents whohave brought the evil karma upon them equally incur the retributive aspect ofthe same law; the situation has now assumed the form of a vicious circle oferror and wrong doing, of retribution and revenge, and in view of this the timemust come when together the nations will confer upon this problem, and togetherthey will cooperate to bring to an end the wrong attitudes on both sides. Allkarma of evil nature is solved by the presentation of an accepting will, acooperative love, a frank acknowledgment of responsibility and a skillfuladjustment of united joint activity to bring about the good of humanity as awhole, and not just the good of an individual nation or people or race. TheJewish problem will not be solved [267] by taking possession of Palestine, byplaint and demand and by financial manipulations. That would be but theprolongation of ancient wrong and material possessiveness. The problem will besolved by the willingness of the Jew to conform to the civilisation, thecultural background and the standards of living of the nation to which—by thefact of birth and education—he is related and with which he should assimilate.It will come by the relinquishment of pride of race and of the concept ofselectivity; it will come by renouncing dogmas and customs which areintrinsically obsolete and which create points of constant irritation to thematrix within which the Jew finds himself; it will come when selfishness inbusiness relations and the pronounced manipulative tendencies of the Hebrewpeople are exchanged for more selfless and honest forms of activity.The Jew, owing to his rays and point of development, is outstandingly creativeand artistic. This he must recognise and not seek as he now does to dominate inall fields, to grasp all opportunities away from other people, and so betterhimself and his own people at the expense of others. Release from the presentsituation will come when the Jew forgets that he is a Jew and becomes in hisinmost consciousness an Italian, an American, a Britisher, a German or a Pole.This is not so at this time. The Jewish problem will be solved by intermarriage;that of the Negro will not. This will mean concession and compromise on the partof the orthodox Jews—not the concession of expediency but the concession ofconviction.Let me point out also that just as the Kabbalah and the Talmud are secondarylines of esoteric approach to truth, and materialistic in their technique(embodying much of the magical work of relating one grade of matter to thesubstance of another grade), so the Old Testament is emphatically a secondaryScripture, and spiritually does not rank [268] with the Bhagavad-Gita, theancient Scriptures of the East and the New Testament. Its emphasis is materialand its effect is to impress a purely materialistic Jehovah upon worldconsciousness. The general theme of the Old Testament is the recovery of thehighest expression of the divine wisdom in the first solar system; that systemembodied the creative work of the third aspect of divinity—that of activeintelligence, expressing itself through matter. In this solar system, thecreated world is intended to be the expression of the second aspect, of the loveof God. This the Jew has never grasped, for the love expressed in the OldTestament is the separative, possessive love of Jehovah for a distinct unitwithin the fourth or human kingdom. St. Paul summed up the attitude whichhumanity should assume in the words: “There is neither Jew nor Gentile.” Theevil karma of the Jew today is intended to end his isolation, to bring him tothe point of relinquishing material goals, of renouncing a nationality that hasa tendency to be somewhat parasitic within the boundaries of other nations, andto express inclusive love, instead of separative unhappiness.And what of the Gentile attitude? It is absolutely necessary that the nationsmeet the Jew more than half way when he arrives at altering—slowly andgradually—his nationalistic orthodoxy. It is essential that they cease from fearand persecution, from hatred and from placing barriers to cooperation. Thegrowing anti-Semitic feeling in the world is inexcusable in the sight of God andman. I refer not here to the abominable cruelties of the obsessed German people.Behind that lies a history of Atlantean relationships into which it is needlessfor me to enter because I could not prove to you the truth of my statements. Irefer to the history of the past two thousand years and to the everydaybehaviour of Gentile people everywhere. There must be a definite effort upon thepart of the nationals of [269] every country to assimilate the Jews, tointer-marry with them, and to refuse to recognise as barriers old habits ofthought and ancient bad relations. Men everywhere must regard it as a blot upontheir national integrity if there is the appearance within their borders of theold duality—Jew and Gentile. There is neither Jew nor Gentile; there is onlyHumanity. This war (1914-1945) should be regarded as having brought to aconclusion the ancient enmity between Jew and Gentile, and the two groups havenow the opportunity to originate a newer and happier measure of living and atruly cooperative relation on either side. The process of assimilation will beslow, for the situation is of so ancient a date that habits of thought,customary attitudes and separative customs are well established and hard toovercome. But the needed changes can be made if goodwill directs the spokenword, the written presentation and the mode of living together. The Hierarchysees no distinction. The Head of the Hierarchy, though not in a Jewish body atthis time, achieved the highest spiritual goal for humanity whilst in a Jewishvehicle. The Hierarchy is also sending into Jewish bodies certain disciples whowill work with full intent at the changing of the situation. There are Jewstoday, a few in number, who do not think in terms of being Jews; who are notpreoccupied with the Jewish problem to the exclusion of all else, and who areendeavouring to fuse all people into one humanity, thus bridging the gap.Again, I say, that the Masters of the Wisdom see neither Jew nor Gentile, butonly souls and sons of God.In dealing with the subject of karma as a factor—decisive and lasting in bothdisease and health—one of the criticisms to which my approach is subjected isthat I deal too much with generalities and that I give no specific and detailedanalysis of particular diseases, particularly of the great [270] basic diseaseswhich today take such a toll of humanity and which are not fundamentally beingcurbed. I do not deal with their symptoms or their cure, and I indicate nottechniques whereby they may be handled. This I feel is a criticism with which Ishould deal, so that you may proceed with your study under no misapprehension.This is an appropriate point at which to stop and meet this contention. Karma isnecessarily a topic which is general and not specific; it is not yet accepted inthe occult sense by the general public. It must be considered along broad linesuntil such time that the Law of Cause and Effect is accepted as a majorconditioning factor in the human consciousness, not only on a large scale but inrelation to individual lives. Of this Law, the public is yet, as a whole,ignorant.It will be obvious to you that it is entirely needless for me to deal with thesymptomatic aspect of diseases and with the facts that have been so ablyascertained by orthodox medical science. We have been for some time consideringthe causes of such diseases, and I propose to deal with occult methods ofproducing cures—where such cures are permissible under the Law of Karma andwhere the healer is willing to work in an occult manner. I have attempted tomake clear to you that the fundamental cause is related to energy, to itspresence in excess as it pours through the centres, or to its deficiency. Herelie the two main factors in the production of disease. It is essential thatthose of you who are interested in the study of disease and its healing shouldadmit this and permit it to form the basis of your approach. I have indicatedthat medicine and medical treatments of the future will start with this fact astheir prime determination. The factual nature of medical discovery is notdisowned by me. I seek to carry the matter forward from that point, and it is nopart of my programme to ignore the wise discoveries of modern medical science,nor am I [271] on the side of those groups of people who run down and refuse toadmit the findings of modern medicine. This I have earlier emphasised. I want toindicate the trend of future medical research, which will be to seek for theseat of the trouble in the realm of vitality (as it may be called by orthodoxinvestigators), and which we would regard as in the realm of the etheric body.Let me here make a practical statement which might be regarded as the next Rulein this treatise:RULE SIXA careful diagnosis of the disease, based on the ascertained outer symptoms,will be simplified to this extent that, once the organ involved is known andthus isolated, the centre in the etheric body which is in closest relation to itwill be subjected to methods of occult healing, though the ordinary,ameliorative, medical or surgical methods will not be withheld.It is here that the fanatical cultist or healer of today so often goes astray.The old approach to medicine, with its physical investigation and its successfulor unsuccessful diagnosis, will still be required until such time thatphysicians and surgeons have clairvoyant faculty, intuitive perception andspiritual insight, and also until they have worked out a technique for handlingenergy in relation to the patient. To this will some day be added correctastrological interpretation, immediate recognition of ray types, and then theapplication of the right healing techniques, as required by the ray whichconditions the patient’s life expression, plus his point in evolution.I am handicapped greatly as a I seek to lay the foundation for this new approachto medicine. I am handicapped by the idealistic pronouncements of the pioneersin the new fields of nature healing, by the naturopaths, and by the [272]premises of Christian Science and the Unity Schools. All that I can do (if youare to profit by my presentation) is to lay down certain broad and generalassumptions which will govern the medical men of the future. But in the interimperiod between the old and the new eras, men will wander in a fog ofspeculation; a great conflict will be engineered between the fundamentalistschools and the speculators and the investigators of the new ideas, andtemporarily the “noble middle path” of the Buddha will be forgotten.There is present today, in the science of medicine, a situation paralleling thatto be found in the realm of religion. The old approach suffices for the massesand is frequently successful both in its ameliorative and preventive aspects,and in its process of diagnosis. This is all that is possible at this time. Inthe same manner, the old religious presentation suffices to guide the unthinkingmasses along certain broad lines of controlled living, and to keep clearly inthe consciousness of the average man certain uncontrovertible, spiritual facts.Both in the guidance and protection of the masses in their spiritual natures andin the guidance and protection of their physical vehicles, doctors and priestscan be divided into various groups—some adhering to old proved techniques, someso fundamentalist in position that they refuse to investigate that which is newand unproven, and some so idealistic, speculative and fanatical that they rushahead and enter into a world of speculative experiment which may or may not givethem the key to the medicine of the future but which certainly puts theirpatients into the category of what you call “guinea pigs.”The surest and least speculative field in medical practice is that which isconcerned with the surgical relief of the patient; it is founded on a sureknowledge of anatomy, its diagnosis of requirements can be intelligentlycontrolled, and [273] its practice (when in the hands of a sound and reputablesurgeon) can and frequently does produce a cure or a real prolongation of life.However, even in that field little is known about the results of an operation asit may affect the etheric body and (consequently) the nervous system through theintermediate system of the “nadis” or the etheric counterpart of the nerves. Iwould instance the removal of some organ. Definite results must necessarily bepresent and a period of difficult adjustment must inevitably take place withinthe subtle mechanism of the patient. The area of the body which has receivedsurgical treatment, and particularly the centre in closest relation to it, mustbe affected, for the circulatory flow of energy, emanating from the centre, willfind itself “short circuited,” if I could use such a phrase. This flow, whichhas hitherto passed through the area of surgical attention, must work its way toall parts of the body, via the “nadis”; these, as you know, underlie and feedthe needed energy to the nervous system. Old channels for the flow of energywill have been removed, as the result of operative measures, major or minor. Newchannels or lines of force, bridging the “mutilated” area, will have to beestablished and a basic adjustment will have to be made within the vitalmechanism of the patient. Along this line there is practically nothing as yetknown. It is not even yet in the field of advanced research.The new medicine cannot be scientifically formulated or intelligently presenteduntil such time as the fact of the etheric body is accepted and its existence,as a mechanism of energy supply and as the vital aspect of the outer form, isgenerally recognised. The shift of the attention of the medical profession willthen be away from the outer, tangible, physical effects and to the inner causes,as they are to be found in the centres and their related fields of activity.[274] Within the areas where a disease is manifested, certain esoteric factsanent the general subject have already been posited by me:1. That disease, in its immediate cause, can be traced to the individual ethericbody when the difficulty is purely local, or to the planetary etheric body (inparticular the etheric body of the fourth kingdom in nature) where epidemics areinvolved, or to such a condition as war, affecting large masses of men.2. That the etheric body has not hitherto been considered as an existent fact,from the angle of orthodox medicine, though there is a modern drift towardsemphasis upon vitality , upon the vital qualities in food, and the giving ofvitamin products in order to build up a vital response. This is the firstindication of an unrealised need to increase the potency of the vital body.3. That the condition of the etheric body predisposes the subject to disease orprotects it from disease, making man resistant to the impact of deteriorating orepidemic factors, or failing to do so because of inherent etheric weakness.4. That the etheric body is the mechanism of vital, pranic life, and“sub-stands” or underlies the outer, familiar equipment of the nervous system,which feeds and actuates all parts of the physical organism. The relationshipexisting between the centres, the nadis and the entire nervous system comprisesthe field of the new medicine and indicates the new major field of research.5. That the main causes of all disease are two in nature:a. They are to be found, first of all, in the stimulation or the nonstimulationof the centres. This simply implies the overactivity or the underactivity of[275] any centre in any part of the body. Where the flow of energy iscommensurate to the demands of the physical body at any particular stage ofdevelopment, then there will be relative freedom from disease.b. They are to be found, secondly, in the karmic effect of the three planetarydiseases: Cancer, Tuberculosis, Syphilitic diseases. Some day medicine willrealise that behind every single disease (irrespective of the results ofaccident or war) lie these three main tendencies in the human body. This is abasic and important statement.6. That the etheric body is a focussing point for all the interior energies ofthe body, and therefore the energy transmitted will not be pure vital energy orsimple planetary prana but will be qualified by forces coming from the astral orthe emotional apparatus, from the mind or from the soul body. These“qualifications of force,” indicating as they do the karma of the individual,are in the last analysis the major conditioning forces. They indicate the pointof development of the individual and the areas of control in his personality.They therefore indicate the state of his karma. This lifts the whole subject ofmedicine into the psychological field and posits the entire problem of karmiceffects and of ray types.7. That these conditioning factors make the etheric body what it is in any oneincarnation; these factors are, in their turn, the result of activitiesinitiated and carried through in previous incarnations, and thus constitute thepatient’s karmic liabilities or his karmic freedoms.8. That the basic energies pouring into the etheric body and conditioning thephysical body will be of two major [276] types: the ray energy of the soul andthe ray energy of the personality, qualified by the three minor forces or therays of the mental nature, the astral body and the physical vehicle. Thistherefore involves five energies which are present in the etheric body which thephysician of the future will have to consider.9. That diagnoses, based upon the recognition of these subjective factors, arenot in reality the involved and complicated matter they appear to be today tothe student of the advanced occult theories. Medical men in the New Age willeventually know enough to relate these various ray forces to their appropriatecentres; hence they will know which type of force is responsible forconditions—good or bad—in any particular area of the body. Some day, when moreresearch and investigation have been carried forward, the science of medicinewill be built upon the fact of the vital body and its constituent energies. Itwill then be discovered that this science will be far simpler and lesscomplicated than present medical science. Today, medicine has reached such apoint of complexity that specialists have perforce been needed who can deal withone area of the body and with its effect upon the entire physical vehicle. Theaverage general practitioner cannot cope with the mass of detailed knowledge nowgathered re the physical body, its various systems, their interrelation andtheir effect upon the many organisms which constitute the whole man. Surgerywill remain occupied with the anatomical necessities of the human frame;medicine will shift its focus of attention, before long, to the etheric body andits incident circulatory systems of energy, its interlocking relationships andthe flow between the seven centres, between the centres themselves and the areaswhich they control. [277] This will mark a tremendous advance in wise and usefulapproach; it will produce a basic simplification; it will lead to more correctmethods of healing, particularly as clairvoyant vision is developed and becomesrecognised by science, and known to be an extension of a normal sense.10. As the true astrology comes into its own and is developed into a reputablescience, the charts of the soul and of the personality can be related to eachother; then the etheric body will be checked by correct astrologicalconclusions, and the physician will be on far surer ground than he now is. Theastrology of the past concerned the life of the personality; the astrology ofthe future will indicate the purpose of the soul, and will completelyrevolutionise medicine (among other things). It must, however, be lifted out ofthe hands of those interested in predictional astrology, out of the hands of thethousands who at this time spend much time “casting” horoscopes (seeking tointerpret their usually erroneous conclusions), and placed in the hands oftrained mathematical scientists and in the hands of those who have given as muchtime to scientific training along astrological lines as is now given to traininga reputable physician, a chemist or a biologist.11. These astrological findings will not only be related to the personality andthe soul charts, but will also enter the field of medicine, particularly inrelation to the etheric body. Today, any astrological investigation done in thefield of medicine has relation to physical disease within the physical body; inthe future, it will concentrate upon the condition of the etheric vehicle. Thisis a new and imminent development in astrological research.[278] Another difficulty which I have to face (as I seek to present to you themedicine of the future) is that I think in terms of cycles and you think interms of a few brief years. What I am in reality attempting to do is to indicatethe lines along which medical research will trend during the next two hundredyears. The effort of the present day approach is how to cure a person here andnow; this is a natural reaction, and advanced thinkers seek to be able to dothis at this time through the medium of so-called esoteric and mental modes ofhealing. Yet little is known of the make-up of the vital body and practically nobackground of research in this field exists. Modern medicine is of very ancientorigin. Over the centuries it has grown and developed until modern skill, modernresearch, modern techniques and modern methods of healing and of cure areamazingly successful. This is oft forgotten in the emphasis laid by theadherents of new and untried schools upon the failures to cure, which theyattribute to wrong methods and fail to allow for karmic limitations. The successof modern medicine is today so great that millions of people are kept alive—ifnot cured—who in earlier days and with less scientific aptitude would normallyhave died. In this developed skill and knowledge, and in this aptitude in thecare of the physical mechanism, is today to be found a major world problem—theproblem of the overpopulation of the planet, leading to the herd life ofhumanity and the consequent economic problem—to mention only one of theincidental difficulties of this success. This “unnatural” preservation of lifeis the cause of much suffering and is a fruitful source of war, being contraryto the karmic intent of the planetary Logos.With this vast problem, I cannot here deal. I can only indicate it. It will besolved when the fear of death disappears and when humanity learns thesignificance of time and [279] the meaning of cycles. It will be simplified whentrue astrological findings become possible, when man knows the hour of hisdeparture from this outer plane, and masters the technique of “withdrawal” andthe methods of abstracting himself consciously from the prison of the body. Butmuch research has to take place first. The fact, however, that the problem isrecognised and that speculation and investigation are rife, indicate that thetime has come—karmically and from the angle of human evolutionarydevelopment—for a study of the etheric body, of the conditioning rays whichgovern its manifestation in space, and of astrology, which governs itsmanifestation in time .It is for this reason that the world today is full of groups in revolt againstorthodox medicine—wrongly in revolt, because in their fanatical enthusiasm fortheir particular approach to the problem of healing, they ignore the beneficentaspects of developed medical science. They thus attempt to throw overboard thecontribution of the ages to man’s knowledge of the human organism, itsinterrelations and its care, cure and preservation; they fail to profit frompast wisdom, but prefer to set sail upon the sea of research in a spirit ofrevolt, full of prejudice and totally unequipped for the task in hand.Naturopaths of many kinds, professors of methods of healing by electricity orlight and colour, food dietitians with infallible cures for all diseases, themany who practice systems founded on the Abrams mode of diagnosis, and manyadvocates of the chiropractic methods, as well as the various healing systemswhich are completely divorced from medicine but which undertake to bring aboutcures, are all indicative of new and hopeful trends; they are neverthelessextremely experimental in nature, and are so fanatically endorsed, so exclusiveof all recognised methods of healing aid (except their own), so violentlyopposed to all the findings [280] of the past, and so unwilling to cooperatewith orthodox medicine that, in many cases, they constitute a definite and realdanger to the public. It is largely their own faulty approach which isresponsible for this; their undoubted ignorance of the nature of the human body,their attack on existent medical practices (even of proven value), and theirbiassed belief in the infallibility of their experimental techniques, havebrought them under the attack of the rigidly orthodox medical practitioners andof the fundamentalists within the ring-pass-not of academic medicine. Yet withinthe ranks of medicine are many enlightened men who would gladly cooperate if thesmall and vociferous cults would relinquish their exclusiveness and be willingto cooperate and accept that which the divine instinct in man down the ages hastaught in connection with the healing of the human body. It will be through thecollaboration of the new experimental schools and the older and proven methodsthat the medicine of the future will be developed. The value of all the manygroups—good and indifferent—lies in the fact that they point the way towards newtrends and indicate the lines along which the medicine of the future can enrichitself and become better adapted to man’s need. They are too experimental as yetto be trustworthy, and are not yet scientifically proved. They are pioneeringgroups, and have a real contribution to make, but this will only be possible ifthey refuse to divorce themselves from the past and are willing to compromise inthe present. Academic medicine is the result of the God-given gifts of the humanmind; it is a proven divine expression and a most beneficent force in the world,in spite of human weakness, commercial exploitation and many mistakes. It is thesame with religion. Both of these great sciences must eliminate the reactionaryand fundamentalist positions, and then proceed with an [281] open mind into thenew ways of approach to divinity and of approach to physical well-being.It might therefore be said that the main contribution which I am making at thistime is to indicate the causes of disease and ill health which are notrecognised by orthodox medicine, which deals with the effects of these subtlecauses as they work out in the physical body and the nervous system. I am notdealing (as I have earlier warned you) with the symptoms of disease, withmedical diagnosis or with systems of applied physical means to bring about curesor to ameliorate conditions. These have kept pace with man’s growing capacity todiscover and to know.Let me reiterate that I am laying the foundation for an approach to the subjectof the physical body in health and disease which will deal primarily with theetheric body. This should eventually lead to an accumulation of knowledge anentenergy, its focal points and distribution in the etheric body, which will equalthat already gained in the field of exact physical knowledge, and that exactknowledge is a fact.The study of inherited disease indicates a faint recognition of man’s karmicliabilities and karmic tendencies. A mistake lies however in the belief thatthese tendencies are to be found in the germs of life and of substance, broughttogether at the moment of conception, and therefore that the father or themother is responsible for the transmission. Such is not the case. The subject inincarnation has—from the angle of the soul—definitely and consciously chosen hisparents for what they can contribute to his physical make-up whilst inincarnation. The vital body is therefore of such a nature that the man ispredisposed to a particular type of infection or of disease; the physical bodyis of such a nature that its line of least resistance permits of the appearanceand control of that which the [282] vital body makes possible; the incarnatingsoul produces, in its creative work and in its vital vehicle, a particularconstitution to which the parents chosen contribute a definite tendency. The manis therefore nonresistant to certain types of disease. This is determined by thekarma of the man.It is well known to students of the esoteric sciences that the physical body issimply an automaton, responsive to and actuated by a subtler body of energieswhich are a true expression of the point in evolution. This point in evolutionmay be that of personality control, through one or other of its bodies, or ofsoul control. These are facts which the medical profession must grasp, and whenit does a great step forward will have been made. Esoteric students are willingto recognise that the physical body is automatic in its response to emotional,mental or soul impression; so closely, however, is the etheric body interwovenwith the physical vehicle that it is well nigh impossible to separate the two inconsciousness; this will not be proven or possible until the science of ethericenergy and the development of clairvoyant perception demonstrate the truth ofwhat I say. This is again a needed repetition.Medical science, through its study of the nervous system and its recognition ofthe power of thought over the physical body, is moving rapidly in a rightdirection. When it admits, in relation to the physical body, that “energyfollows thought,” and then begins to experiment with the concept of thoughtcurrents (as they are erroneously called) which are directed to certain areas ofthe etheric body—where the esotericists posit the existence of energy points orcentres—much will then be discovered. Christian Science had a sound conceptionin its original basic concept of the mind as a permanently existent factor; itsoveremphasis upon the mind, its idealistic presentation of human nature, [283]its expectancy of man’s capacity to demonstrate today and immediately as a fullymanifested son of God (with no intermediate or necessary unfoldments), and itscontradictory position of using the energy of the mind for mainly physicalrequirements have soundly negated its basic tenets. Otherwise Man might havebeen permanently deluded. Had Christian Science fulfilled the original intentionof the group of initiates who sought to influence humanity through its agency,and had it developed the idea correctly that energy follows thought, medicalscience would have greatly benefited.Its presentation was both too high and too low, and a great opportunity waslost. Christian Science has failed from the angle of the Hierarchy, and itsusefulness has been largely negated.Healers and healing groups work as yet at a great disadvantage; but they canbegin now to work, and their work is of a twofold nature:1. They can, through the power of directed thought, pour energy into the centrewhich is the determining factor in that area of the physical body where thetrouble lies. If, for instance, the patient is suffering from such a difficultyas gastric ulcer, the stimulation of the solar plexus centre may produce a cure,provided that the work done is purely mental and that the results expected arepurely physical . Otherwise the emotional nature will share in the stimulationand real difficulty will arise.2. They can stimulate a centre higher than the one controlling a particular areaand thus—by the intensification of the higher centre—reduce the vitality of thelower. If, for instance, there is disease or trouble in connection with theorgans of generation [284] (as for instance disease of the prostate gland), thenthe throat centre should receive attention. It is that centre which musteventually be the recipient of the energy of the lower creative aspect orcorrespondence. This is called “the technique of the withdrawal of the fire”; byits means what you call overstimulation in certain cases, or inflammation inothers, can be stopped.These two ways of using energy and thought control form the occult basis for thetwo fundamental methods used in directing energy in diseased areas. Theyproduce, in the one case, an intensification of the life of the associatedcentre, with a consequent definite effect upon the diseased area; or they lessenthe inflow of force in the other case, and thus weaken the quality of thedisease. It will be apparent, therefore, that much must be known of the effectsof these two basic and different techniques before a healer dare work. Otherwisehe might greatly increase the trouble in the diseased area and even succeed(which frequently happens) in killing the patient.There is another point which I would seek to emphasise. In all healing methodsof an esoteric nature, it is essential that sound medical practices of anorthodox kind accompany the subtler modes of help. It is in the wise combinationof the two approaches, and in the cooperative work of the orthodox physician andof the occult healer or healing group, that the soundest results will beproduced.Students who attempt to heal will therefore need to realise two things: thenature of the disease, as diagnosed by a good physician, and the centre whichcontrols the area of the disease. The safest plan for the average student ofhealing or for a healing group is to work in cooperation with some reputabledoctor and in relation to the centre [285] which controls the diseased area.Initiates, in their healing work, deal with the higher correspondence of thecontrolling centre, working always through the analogous emotional and mentalcentres. This is neither possible nor permissible to the ordinary healing group.The higher the centres considered, involved and dealt with, the more potent theresults, and therefore the greater care required.The whole process is one of either stimulating activity or of withdrawingenergy, of making more active an allied centre and thus abstracting attentionfrom the centre governing the diseased area or organ, or of balancing theenergies flowing between two centres and thus producing an equable and eveninterplay. The more the neophyte studies this subject of healing the morecomplex it will appear, until the time comes when he can work in collaborationwith some physician who has the inner vision and can see the centres, or withpatients who know within themselves their own destiny and can collaborate withsome group which has sound occult knowledge, which can ascertain the patient’srays and which knows at least the nature of his disposition or his“indisposition,” through consulting his natal chart.You might ask, therefore, in view of all this, if it is possible for you to dodefinite healing work that will be effective, sound, right and permissible. Therisks of over- or understimulation seem too great; the knowledge of the healerseems too small to permit experiment, and the karma of the patient isnecessarily (for the average healer) not yet ascertainable.To this I would reply that all work of a pioneering and experimental nature hasalways its own special risks. Many have been the casualties of science, andparticularly of medical science, in the early days of modern medicine andsurgery. But this never deterred the sincere investigator or slackened thegrowth of knowledge; in these days of pioneering [286] in the field of occulthealing, the same courage must be shown and the same risks assumed. Thesafeguard from the strictly legal and human angle will be that the patient willbe in the hands of a reputable physician for diagnosis and medical care duringthe time that the occult healer is endeavouring to be of vital helpfulness.The work of the healer and of the healing groups will therefore be supplementaryto the orthodox care; results will have to be carefully watched and noted onboth sides. Any group which is formed for healing should work under certaindetermined policies, and here are a few which I would suggest as essential tosuccess in this transitional period:1. The patient to be healed (or helped, if healing is not possible) shouldalways be in the hands of a good and reputable doctor, and if not, should beencouraged to consult one.2. The nature of the disease should be known to the group, and should bedetermined by careful, orthodox medical diagnosis.3. The age of the patient, his birth date and some information anent hiscircumstances should also be known, so as to provide a focal point of interest,and a magnetic area should be constructed around the patient which will attractthe thought-directed energy of the group.4. The healer or the healing group should have a general grasp of the nature andthe anatomy of the body, the placement of the various organs in the body and theposition and nature of the centres governing the diseased area or areas. Chartsgiving this information should be studied.5. The faculty of imagination and the power of visualisation should beemphasised in a healing group, and the [287] ability should be developed to sendstreams of energy to the patient and to the area in the patient’s body where thetrouble lies.6. The healer or the healing group must remember that it is not mental energyonly with which he works. He, for himself,a. Creates a thought of healing power.b. That created focal point of concentrated attention becomes the directingagent for the healing force or prana.c. This prana is neither mental nor astral in nature. It is pure planetarysubstance or living essence, and is that substance of which the vital body ofthe planet is made.d. The healer or the healing group appropriates as much of this substance as ispossible, and by the power of their united thought they direct it to and throughthe centre involved. Healing work is circulatory , and this must not beforgotten. The pranic energy (thought-directed) is not sent to the centre andthere permitted to accumulate. It is passed through the centre, first of all tothe organ involved or the area where difficulty is to be found, and then is sentout to the body as a totality. It might be regarded as a system of flushing ,with a purificatory and stimulating effect.It is only possible in these early days of experiment and work along these linesto give certain simple rules. Out of the results achieved experience will come,and the healing group will learn gradually how to work, when to change itsmethods, and what to notice.[288] From the start of work along these lines, records should be kept. In thisaspect of the work the patient will frequently cooperate. Dates, incidentalphenomena, changes for the better or the worse should be noted, along withinformation as is possible anent the patient’s general condition. For thisreason, I recommend that in the early stages of this work healing be attemptedonly in connection with those who are well known to the members or who are putin the hands of the healing group by physicians or by those willing to give fullinformation.People who are so ill that they are not expected to live, or who are sufferingfrom diseases which preclude ultimate recovery, should not be taken into thehealing group for treatment, except with ameliorative results in mind. Noneophyte knows enough of karma to work with confidence either at the task ofhealth or of release by death. If, however, a patient gets worse whilst thegroup is working upon his case, he should not be dropped, but a definite anddifferent technique can then be used to ease the path of death. In the nextsection I intend to touch upon the karma of death.If you will bear in mind that work in connection with the etheric body (as aninstrument of vitality) is today as little known as the science of modernmedicine was known in the year 1200 A.D., you will be enabled to work withoutdiscouragement and without that undue expectation which today handicaps theneophyte. Assume consciously the position that nothing is as yet really knownanent the centres, the areas of energy in the body, and thought direction;realise also that you are engaging upon a great research project. Nothing,literally nothing, has been done in relation to medicine and the science of thecentres in any practical way, though certain books upon the relation of thecentres to psychological research and equipment and the glandular [289] orendocrine system have played tentatively with the subject. The field of researchwhich I propose to you is an entirely new one. Those among you who enter it maynot see the results of what you are attempting to do. Your impatience and youreagerness to help may handicap you; your ignorance may cause you to makemistakes. But, go on; persevere; keep careful records and preserve allcorrespondence. Then the results will be sure.1. KARMIC LIABILITIES OF THE INDIVIDUALWe have already studied (perhaps without realising its implications) our firstpoint under this heading. This concerns the karmic liabilities of theindividual, emerging from the subjective vehicles and from the personality as awhole.As we discussed the psychological causes of disease as they arise in the subtlevehicles in the three worlds or from the disciple’s tension as he endeavours totread the Path, we were in reality concerned entirely with karma or the effectof the inner causes of events, equipment and circumstances upon the physicalplane. We saw how the inner bodies, via the etheric body, conditioned the man’souter manifestation, and that disease or health was largely dependent upon them.They are the immediate karmic cause of physical plane existence. If the idea isthen extended to include previous incarnations—as must inevitably be thecase—then we arrive at the conclusion that the condition of these inner bodies,their limitations and their richness, their defects and their assets, and theirgeneral psychic and psychological tendencies are inherited from previous lives,and are therefore responsible for the present earthly situation. We have,consequently, simply pushed the causes of present day conditions still furtherback, and we could—if we so desired—enter a field of such intricacy and detailthat nothing profitable would eventuate. The whole problem of the recovery [290]of past incarnations is one of infinite possibility, and when I use this word“infinite” I immediately put the whole subject out of the control of the finitemind. We are then dealing with something which it is not possible to handlerationally.Karma was, for infant humanity and for the undeveloped individual, a groupmatter. The man was a member of a group but without any thought as to theimplications and the responsibilities entailed. Later, as the process ofindividualisation became more effective in character and purpose and morepronounced in temperament, karma became also more personal and definite, and theman in a position to make or work off more causes and effects. The personalitynot being thoroughly unfolded and integrated, the man was still involved ingroup life and the interrelations became more extensive. Later on, thepersonality became the conscious creator of its own causes and the consciousparticipator in the effects. Upon the Path, the karma of the chosen group, ofthe individual, and of those with whom the man chooses association through unityof spiritual purpose involves him, and another factor is added to the previouscategories of karmic responsibility. Later still, karma in the three worlds ismet, overcome and negated; at the same time karma connected with the initiatingof causes through world service is added to that which the individual hasalready experienced, and he shares in the karmic responsibility of the Hierarchyitself. All these stages:1. Elementary group karma—of the primitive man,2. Individual karma of the self-conscious developing man,3. Karma, related to the life of the disciple,4. Hierarchical karma,[291] must be added to the well known Karma of Retribution with which thedisciple is already familiar; to it must also be added national and racialkarma, plus the educational karma which all disciples bring upon themselves whenthey are desirous of entering an Ashram to prepare for initiation.There is also the Karma of Reward in contradistinction to that of Retribution ;this is a type of karma oft forgotten, but one which will become better known inthe coming world cycle. Humanity has worked off much evil karma, and the karmabased on causes later to be initiated will not generate such dire effects asthat of the past. Not all karma is bad, in spite of what man thinks. Much of itis necessarily punitive and distressing, owing to humanity’s ignorance and lowstage of development. When karmic retribution becomes acute and terrible, as itis in today’s appalling world experience, it indicates that humanity has reacheda point where consequences can be meted out on a large scale and with justice.Very little suffering is attached to karma where there is ignorance, leading toirresponsibility and complete lack of thought and there is attached to affairsbut little true sense of guilt. There may be unhappy conditions and distressingcircumstances, but the ability to respond to such conditions with commensuratepain is lacking; there is little mental reaction to the processes of karmicretribution. This should be borne in mind. The Aryan race is now, however, sodeveloped mentally and on a large scale that karma is truly horrible andagonising and can express itself through world conditions. At the same time, thepresent widespread distress indicates the extent and success of human unfoldmentand is a most hopeful and promising sign. In this idea, you have the clue as towhy the good, the holy and the saintly servers of the race carry—in this worldcycle—such a heavy load of karmic ill.[292] It is consequently quite impossible in the scope of this treatise to dealmore fully with this subject of karma as it produces the many types of humanills, including disease—only one of its manifestations. The theme is too vast,too complicated and too widely diffusing in its effect. All that one can do isto posit the fact that past actions and reactions have established in previouslives such a karmic rhythm that today all the aspects of the lower nature areinvolved; and among the commonest and most ordinary effects, and one in whichthe great Law of Retribution takes effect, is that of disease. This is a pointwhich healers and metaphysicians, so-called, should most carefully consider.2. THE SEVEN RAY CAUSES OF KARMAThese carry the cause of all human difficulties, including ill health anddisease—individual, national and racial—still further back to the very origin ofcreation itself. Karma demonstrates in those streams of energy and of primordialsubstance which pour into and through the created world, including the lowerthree worlds where work the lunar pitris and the elemental essences of allforms. This primordial karma (if I may so call it) is contributory to theexistence of disease. We are told in the ancient books, to which the Mastershave access, that the world is constructed of substance which is already taintedwith the karma of a previous solar system.It will be apparent to you that these streams of force, emanating from the Lordsof the Seven Rays, are coloured, therefore, and “tainted”—if I may use such aword—by the limitations of these same great Beings; They are Gods, from ourpoint of view, but in reality, Gods in the making, even though much nearer solardivinity than the most advanced human being is near to planetary divinity. Theyare the “imperfect Gods” spoken of in The Secret Doctrine [293] and are theplanetary Logoi of the sacred and non-sacred planets. If the great informingLives of the planets within our solar system are imperfect, the effect of thisimperfection must inevitably affect Their planetary creations, Their bodies ofmanifestation, and thus introduce a karmic condition over which the individualhuman being has absolutely no control, but within which he moves and which heshares. It is obviously impossible for me to elucidate this theme. All I can door am permitted to do is to give you seven stanzas from one of the most ancientvolumes in the world; it deals with the seven ray causes of imperfections in ourplanetary manifestations. To these should be added (if it were only possible)the stanzas which convey the significance of the defects emerging fromastrological conditions and producing effects of a planetary nature andinvolving, therefore, the horoscope of our particular planetary Logos. But theseare far too abstruse, elaborate and far-reaching in their theme, and can bestudied and considered only when humanity has reached such a stage of intuitivedevelopment that men can “appreciate causes and effects as whole processes andcan see both the beginning and the end in one flash of time in space.” In thesewords the Master Serapis once summed up the matter when endeavouring to train agroup of initiated disciples in this mode of approaching vast subjects.The “Book of Karma” has in it the following stanzas, and these can serve as anintroduction to those dealing with the Seven Ray causes of inharmony anddisease. To the intuitive aspirant some meaning will emerge, but he must everbear in mind that all that I am attempting to do is to put intowords—unsatisfactory and quite inadequate—stanzas concerning the conditioningfactors in the equipment of those great Beings Whose life force (which we callenergy) creates all that is, colours and shapes all [294] manifestations withinthe worlds, and adds its quota of force to the equipment of every single humanbeing. Every man appropriates this energy to the measure of his need, and hisneed is the sign of his development. The stanzas I have selected are from TheBook of Imperfections. Part Fourteen:“The seven imperfections issued forth and tainted substance from the highestsphere unto the lowest. The seven perfections followed next, and the two—thatwhich is whole and sound and that which is known as detail and unwholesome in anawful sense—met upon the plane of physical life. (The etheric plane.—A.A.B.)And there they fought, swinging into the conflict all that they were and had,all that was seen and all that was unseen within the triple ring. (The threelower worlds.—A.A.B.)The seven imperfections entered the seven races of men, each in their own place;they coloured the seven points within each race. (The seven planetary centres,transmitting imperfect energy.—A.A.B.)The seven perfections hovered o’er each race, over each man within each race andover each point within each man.And thus the conflict grew from the outermost to the innermost, from thegreatest One to the littlest ones. Seven the imperfections. Seven the perfectwholes; seven the ways to oust the dark of imperfection and demonstrate theclear cold light, the white electric light of perfect wholeness.”All that you can gain from the above, my brother, is a concept of agelongconflict, of seven great energies which manifest as dualities and which producewhen anchored within one body (whether that of a planet, a man or an [295] atom)an area or cycle of distress, as it is called; this distress produces theevolutionary urge and is itself the cause of manifestation, whilst its effect(which is karma) is the liberation ultimately of the perfect and the good. Thesethings are not easy to comprehend. It must be remembered that the sevenimperfections are related to the sevenfold nature of the One in Whom we live andmove and have our being, and that these seven imperfect energies hold withinthemselves the perfect will-to-good, more potent in the long run than thewill-to-harm.These energies pour through the seven centres of the planetary body and are—asfar as we are concerned—the seven ray energies. In relation to the will-to-harmwhich can and does demonstrate as disease in all the four kingdoms in nature,you have the reason why I instituted, among the esoteric students for whom Ihave made myself responsible, the development of harmlessness. It is the majoragent for the offsetting of karma. I will here give you Law IX, and thuscomplete a group of laws which, when followed, will be found essential to thecuring of disease and the maintenance of health.LAW IXPerfection calls imperfection to the surface. Good drives evil always from theform of man in time and space. The method used by the Perfect One and thatemployed by Good is harmlessness. This is not negativity but perfect poise, acompleted point of view and divine understanding.You will have noticed that what I have said in this connection removes the wholesubject of disease into a distant world of origins—a world into which man is asyet unable to penetrate. It is for this reason that I have devoted so much timeto the consideration of the causes of disease; more than half of what I have tosay is to be [296] found in this first part of our discussion. We have nearlyconcluded this, and face what many will regard as the more useful and practicalpart of the teaching anent this subject. It has never been my intention to dealwith the pathology of disease or the symptoms of the many forms of ill healthwhich ravage mankind. I seek mainly to lay the stress upon the subjectivereasons for the majority of ills which attack the human frame. My purpose is,however, sound. The overemphasis which people put upon disease is bewildering tothe soul, for it places the transient, constantly changing form-nature in aposition of undue prominence, whereas—from the angle of the soul—thevicissitudes of the body are only of importance just in so far as theycontribute to the enrichment of soul experience.The factor that is of importance is the causes, initiated by man from life tolife; these work out in the appearance of disease, in the emergence of somedisastrous consequence in circumstance and in event, and in the generalconditioning of some particular incarnation. It is with these causes that manmust learn to deal, to recognise them, and to trace the conditioning energy tothe appropriate effect, dealing primarily then with the task of negating thecause by the opposition of a trained will. Karma is not an inevitable,inescapable and dire happening. It can be offset; but this offsetting,particularly where disease is concerned, will include four lines of activity:1. Determining the nature of the cause and the area in consciousness where itoriginated.2. Developing those qualities which are the polar opposite of the effectivecause.3. Practising harmlessness so as to arrest the expression of the cause and toprevent any further implementing of the unfortunate condition.[297]4. Taking the necessary physical steps which will produce the conditions whichthe soul desires. These steps will include:a. A mental acquiescence and an acceptance of the fact of the effect—in the casewhich we are considering in relation to karma—disease.b. Wise action along the lines of orthodox medical procedure.c. The assistance of a healing group or a healer for aid in inner spiritualhealing.d. Clear vision as to the outcome. This may lead to preparation for a moreuseful physical plane life or preparation for the great transition called death.But behind all wise thinking and wise activity must be the acceptance of theexistence of certain general conditions which work out as physical ill healthduring this world cycle, and not only for the human kingdom but also for thethree sub-human kingdoms. The Law of Imperfection exists because the GreatRealities (to be found in all the phenomenal world) are likewise in process ofdevelopment and of evolutionary unfoldment. Therefore, until They, as spiritualBeings, have developed “sublime control”—as it is called—over the substance ofTheir phenomenal forms, those forms will fall short of divine perfection.Disease is only a form of transient imperfection, and death is just a method forrefocussing energy, prior to a forward moving activity, leading steadily andalways towards betterment.The comprehension of the seven stanzas which I now propose to give you will leadeventually to the isolation of the seven psychological causes of disease,inherent in the substance of all forms in this world cycle, because all formsare infused with the life energy of the “imperfect Gods.” [298] The sevenSpirits, we are told in the Scriptures of the world, are “before the Throne ofGod”; this signifies that They are not yet in a position to mount the Throne,symbolically speaking, owing to the fact that They have not yet achievedcomplete divine expression. These Lords of the Seven Rays are greater and moreadvanced in the spiritual scale than are those great Lives who form the Councilof the Lord of the World in Shamballa. They are the Representatives of the sevenray Energies Who inform the seven sacred planets but are not yet as divinelydeveloped as They are. The problem of humanity in respect to imperfection iscomplicated, not only by the fact that the seven informing vitalising Energiesare “tainted with imperfection,” but also by the fact that the Lord of the Worldis Himself, from the angle of a Solar Logos for instance, far from perfect; thisis the reason why our planet, the Earth, is not a sacred planet. We are toldthat Sanat Kumara is the divine prisoner of this planet, held here until the“last weary pilgrim has found his way home.” This is His heavy karma even whilstit is an expression of His desire and of His joy; the “weary pilgrims” are theatoms (human or otherwise) in His body, and they are tainted with imperfectionbecause of His imperfections; their complete “healing” will set the term for Hisrelease.Bear in mind, therefore, that the stanzas—seven in number—now to be given,indicate the quality of the descending energies and the taints which theseenergies carry and convey to all forms which are vitalised by the life of ourplanetary Logos.The Seven Ray Causes of Inharmony and DiseaseI. “The Great One set Himself to follow by Himself alone His chosen path. Hebrooked no interference. He hardened in His courses. From plane [299] to plane,this hardening proceeded; it grew and stiffened. His will was set, andcrystal-like, brilliant, brittle and hard. The power to crystallise was His. Hebrought not will-to-live but will-to-die. Death was His gift to life. Infusionand diffusion pleased Him not. He loved and sought abstraction.”As far as we can understand the significance of this stanza in relation to ourtheme of disease, the imperfection of this divine energy produces a peculiarattitude which expresses itself in the power to crystallise, to harden, to bringabout attrition and cause the great abstracting process which we call death.Other results are the many crystallising processes going on in the physicalform, all atrophying processes, and old age.II. “The Great One poured His life throughout all parts and every aspect ofmanifestation. From the centre to the periphery and from the periphery to thecentre He rushed, carrying abundance of life, energising all forms of Himself,producing excess of movement, endless extension, abundant growth and unduehaste. He knew not what He wanted because He wanted all, desired all, attractedall and gave to all too much.”The imperfection of this great energy with its building, vitalising and coheringpotency, was and is the power to overstimulate, to produce accretion, to piletogether, to build too many forms, to attract too many atoms and to bring aboutthose conditions which lead to what has been called (esoterically) “thesuffocation of the life”—another form of dying, but dying this time as a resultof excessive vitality, affecting the blood stream, producing building within theforms already built, and frequently creating an [300] etheric vehicle which istoo potent for the outer exoteric physical form. Other results are, forinstance, the appearance of tumors, of cancers, of growths, and theoverdevelopment of bodily aspects, overlarge organs and supernumerary bodilyparts.III. “The Great One gathered here and there. He chose and He rejected. Thispower He refused and this power He accepted. He had no purpose linked to the sixpurposes of His six Brothers. He acquired a form and liked it not; threw it awayand chose another. He had no settled point or plan but lived in glamour andliked it well. He smothered both the good and the bad, though using both. Excessin one direction could be seen and starvation in another. Both these extremesgoverned His choice of living substance, He threw together those that suited noteach other, then saw the end was sorrow and deceit. Patterns He made, butpurpose suited not. He gave up in despair.”The main effect of this imperfect “maneuvering” and manipulation, as it has beencalled, is largely astral in nature, producing consequent physical ill healthand the undesirable effects which we have already studied in this treatise. Itis because this third ray energy is the energy of substance itself that itsimperfections demonstrate profusely in the human tendency to disease. Glamourresults from the excessive use of this third ray energy for selfish and personalends and manifests primarily upon the sixth or astral plane. As a result of thismanipulation of desire, and the wild maneuvering for its satisfaction alongmaterial lines, you have such diseases as the gastric and intestinal disordersand the various stomach troubles which devastate [301] civilised humanity—farmore than the savage races. Certain brain disorders also are effects, and lowvitality.IV. “The Great One fought and entered into combat. All that He met appeared toHim a subject for display of power. Within the fourth He found a field of battleand settled down to fight. He saw the right and knew the wrong and vibratedbetween the two, fighting first one and then the other, but missing all the timethat midway point where battle is not known. There harmony, ease, rest andpeaceful silence will be found. He weakened all the forms which used Hisstrength and power. Yet all the time He sought for beauty; searched forloveliness; and yearned for peace. Despair overtook Him in His courses, and withdespair the will-to-live could not survive. Yet all the time the loveliness wasthere.”Here we have a strong indication as to the reason why humanity (the fourthkingdom in nature) succumbs with such rapidity and such ease to disease. Theconflicts to which humanity is so constantly summoned, both in group form and asindividuals, lead—until understood and used as a means to triumph andprogress—to a condition of constant devitalisation. Where this is present,resistance to disease fades out and practically all forms of ill health andbodily ills become possible. Diffusion of energy leads to a constant lesseningof this resistance. As a result you have debility, quick and bad reaction to thedisease indigenous in the planet itself, and a rapid taking on of infections andof contagious diseases. It is this energy which lies behind what we callepidemics, and influenza is one of its main expressions.[302]V. “The Great One arose in His wrath and separated Himself. He swept aside thegreat dualities and saw primarily the field of multiplicity. He producedcleavage on every hand. He wrought with potent thought for separative action. Heestablished barriers with joy. He brooked no understanding; He knew no unity,for He was cold, austere, ascetic and forever cruel. He stood between thetender, loving centre of all lives and the outer court of writhing, living men.Yet He stood not at the midway point, and naught He did sufficed to heal thebreach. He widened all cleavages, erected barriers, and sought to make stillwider gaps.”It has been most difficult to describe the nature of the imperfection of theenergy of the Lord of the fifth ray. In the activity of this energy whichdemonstrates primarily upon the fifth or mental plane will be found eventuallythe source of many psychological disorders and mental trouble. Cleavage is theoutstanding characteristic—cleavage within the individual or between theindividual and his group, rendering him anti-social. I have dealt with this inan earlier part of this treatise and need not further enlarge upon thedifficulties here (In Esoteric Psychology, Vol. II of A Treatise on the SevenRays ). Other results are certain forms of insanities, brain lesions and thosegaps in the relation of the physical body to the subtle bodies which show asimbecilities and psychological troubles. Another form of disease, emerging as aresult of this fifth ray force is migraine, which is caused by a lack ofrelationship between the energy around the pineal gland and that around thepituitary body.VI. “The Great One loved Himself in others and in all forms. On every hand, Hesaw objects of His [303] devotion and ever they proved to be Himself. Into theseothers He ever poured Himself, asking response and never getting it. Surely andwith certainty the outlines of the forms so loved were lost, grew dim anddisappeared. The objects of His love slowly faded out. Only a world of shadows,of mist and fog remain. And as He looked upon Himself, He said: Lord of Glamour,that am I, and the Angel of Bewilderment. Naught is clear to me. I love yet allseems wrong! I know that love is right and the spirit of the universe. What thenis wrong?”Curiously enough, it is the potency of this sixth ray force (as it feeds desire)which is responsible for much of the ills and diseases of humanity which arebased upon the misuse of the mission and function of sex. Desire, bewilderment,weakness, perversions and the one-pointed development of sexual and othersatisfactions grow out of the misuse of this energy. The bewilderment growingout of desire leads to a violently demanded satisfaction and the taking of thosesteps—some right and some wrong—which lead to satisfaction. The results cover awide field, all the way from sadistic cruelty and lust to those marriages whichare based on physical desire and to those conditions which lead to the manyforms of sexual disease. A clue to this whole world-wide problem lies in thewords of an ancient writing which says that “the imperfection of the Lord of theSixth Ray opened the door to an erroneous marriage between the poles.”VII. “The Great One gathered to Himself His forces and affirmed His intention tocreate. He created that which is outer and can be seen. He saw His creations andliked them not and so withdrew His attention; then the creations He had madedied [304] and disappeared. He had no lasting success and saw naught but failureas He travelled on the outer path of life. He comprehended not the need offorms. To some He gave an over-plus of life, to some too little; and so bothkinds died and failed to show the beauty of the Lord Who gave them life butfailed to give them understanding. He knew not then that love sustains.”The effects of this ray force are most peculiar and will be a great deal moreprevalent than heretofore, as this ray is now coming into power. It is thisenergy which is largely responsible for infections and contagious diseases. Thekeynote of the work of the seventh ray is to bring together life and matter uponthe physical plane. This, however, when viewed from the angle of imperfection,is a bringing together (if you can understand the implications) of Life, thelives and the general livingness of the creative process. This is symbolised bythe promiscuity and the endless moving interplay of all life within all lives.The result is therefore the activity of all germs and bacteria within the mediumwhich will best nurture them.These are abstruse and difficult concepts, but they should be pondered upon, anddeep reflection will lead to understanding. All disease and ill health are theresult of the activity or the inactivity of one or other of the seven types ofenergy as they play upon the human body. All physical ills emerge out of theimpact of these imperfect energies as they make their impact upon, enter intoand pass through the centres in the body. All depends upon the condition of theseven centres in the human body; through these the impersonal energies play,carrying life, disease or death, stimulating the imperfections in the body orbringing healing to the body. All depends, as far as the human being is [305]concerned, upon the condition of the physical body, the age of the soul and thekarmic possibilities.I would ask you not to misinterpret the significance of the word “imperfection”which I have used so constantly in relation to the great Beings Who express adivinity unattainable by humanity at any time upon this particular planet. Youmust bear in mind that this solar system is the second, and that in the firstsolar system the emphasis was laid upon intelligent materiality; the goal of thehighest initiate was to attain complete control over matter, to unfold the mindprinciple and to evidence a definite materialism. In these so distant aeons thatmarked attainment, whereas in this solar system it marks defeat for humanity.This system, including all the planets along with our Earth, has a differentgoal, and the second divine aspect, that of love, has to be manifested, andmanifested through the medium of matter impregnated with the qualities developedin system one. What was perfection at that time is not so now. Therefore, theGreat Beings which are the sumtotal of all that is, are working through and insubstance, which is already tinged or tainted with that which must be leftbehind and subjected to no further unfoldment.These are the imperfections which we are considering—the seven aspects ofintelligent materiality; it is here that disease has its seat and expression. Weare told that the physical body is not a principle; in the last solar system itwas. In this, the principles are different and it is in the clash between whatis and what will be (what wills-to-be) that we have, upon the physical plane,the causes of disease and death. Ponder on these matters and bear in mind thatyou must see the picture upon a large scale, as large a scale as possible, ifthere is to be a true understanding of some of the causes of physical ills anddisease."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV - SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED[306] Most questions asked by the neophyte would remain unasked if he had morepatience and understood better what he was studying. Beginners need to awaitdevelopments in themselves and expand their consciousness normally underinstruction. However, the teacher may invite the asking of questions and forreasons:1. Because where a group is involved and the members are very intelligent,through their questionings they could make much progress in learning to know andunderstand each other. Threads of intercourse could be set up which would linkthem more closely together.2. Because through the questions, the teacher himself can enter into a closerrapport with the students’ viewpoint. For example, myself, and the Western pointof view as regards the healing art.Forget not that I am an Oriental in the last analysis, and such is my backgroundand training. I may know profoundly more about the healing art than you do andabout the energies which constitute the human body, but your point of view, yourterminologies, and your attitudes of mind are still somewhat foreign to me. Yourquestions would help me to understand your background and your limitations, andso enable me to aid you with greater intelligence.[307] 3. Because asking of intelligent questions is the occult method offocussing the mind, of synthesising knowledge, and of becoming aware of thefield of inquiry, and of possible expansions of consciousness.On the Nature of Congestion.How can I define congestion for you when the understanding of force and energyand their relation to each other in the human body is still as yet an embryonicstudy? To say that congestion is congealed force is misleading; to say that itis static energy means little; to say that it is irregular or non-rhythmicvibration hardly makes sense. My problem is lack of words and of correct termsin which to carry to you esoteric truth.Congestion is perhaps best defined as the arresting of the free flow of theforce through the centres or centre and throughout the body. It exists in twoforms:1. That congestion which produces its effect within the centre itself, andtherefore and consequently, upon the gland. It is inhibited, either as it poursinto the centre (when it does not affect the gland except in a negative sense),or as it leaves it (when its effect will be positive in some way or another).When the difficulty takes place as it pours into the centre, then the energy isthrown back upon its originating source—either the astral or mental bodies—andyou have a psychological inhibition. There is no impetus from within to whichthe allied gland can respond. When the difficulty is in the outlet into thephysical body, you will have no free flow of force, the gland related to thecentre will be definitely affected, and either be overstimulated by thenonrhythmic flow or undernourished. This in turn affects the glandular secretionand later the blood stream.[308]2. That congestion which takes place as the energy or the life force flowsthroughout the physical body, and as it flows finds there certain forms ofweakness, various diseased areas and regions where its flow is impeded or toorapidly circulated. The flow of energy can be arrested in certain areas and cannourish also diseased areas in the body, or can also cure and cleanse them. Atemporary congestion can be of beneficent value as well as a malefic force. Thismay surprise you?Again, I have to repeat how vast is the subject with which we are dealing, andall these earlier instructions and the answers which I give to the questionsonly serve to show how abstruse the matter is. But if you will have patience andwill be willing to learn by absorption more than by analysis, you will laterdiscover that you know much—intuitively and discriminately.On Ascertaining the Location of Congestion.There are three ways whereby the healer can ascertain the presence and thelocation of congestion and any other form of difficulty-producing objectivedisease:1. There is, first of all, clairvoyance which enables the healer to see visuallywhere the difficulty lies. This form of diagnosis is not always accurate and canbe “coloured” by conditions present in the healer himself.2. There is a form of direct perception, a process of “clear knowing,” which isa soul faculty and infallible, once a person has been rightly trained in itsuse. It is a blend of mental and spiritual perception and is definite knowledge,or an intuition, if you like, which enables the healer unerringly to put hisfinger on the place of difficulty and to know its cause, its effect and itsend.[309]3. There is also a more physical method, which is based on sensitivity in thelower nature, which enables the healer to register in his own body the samedifficulty of which the patient is aware. This is called “occult transference”and should only be employed by those who know how to absorb and to dissipate. Inthis case, the healer can also feel the cause of the disease through the pouringin of energy to the etheric counterpart of the physical plane disease, or as anextreme emotionalism or sensitive response in the astral counterpart.On the Dual Cause of Congestion.Let me make one or two concise statements and then explain. First, subjectivecondition alone cannot cause an outer congestion. The soul has arranged toexpress itself through the medium of a body which has certain predispositions. Second, the subjective is a causative factor when in collaboration with theinherited tendencies of the physical body; therefore, all congestion cannot beavoided, for the subjective life determines the condition and the physical bodyis predisposed to certain diseases. This is the will of the soul. Might I pointout that at this stage of human evolution, no subjective conditions are everright?Third, an outer condition alone cannot be a causative factor. If I am right inmy major premises (and this the new and coming science will prove), then theobservations of the medical world will need to be readjusted to the facts. Thecausative factor exists in the meeting of the inner and the outer existingfactors.Let me make the matter a little clearer, for confusion may be caused by the ideathat disease is the result of two causes—an inner cause and an outer cause. Thesubjective [310] situation is the initiating cause. Some psychological factor,leading to a wrong use of energy, sets in motion those inner tendencies whichfind their way out, as vital determining factors, on to the physical plane.There they come into contact with the physical body or expression which hascertain predispositions, certain inherited weaknesses, certain glandulardeficiencies—all of which were part of the needed equipment whereby the souldetermined that certain needed lessons should he mastered. The relationestablished between the outer and the inner forces is the basic cause(expressing itself in two causes) which produces some form of disease. It isagain the negative and the positive aspects brought into a relation whichproduces a third factor: the manifestation of some form of disease.If you speak of perfect physical conditions, I know of no such conditions or ofany physical body or physical environment to which such a term could be applied.There must be both the inner psychological situation and cause, which is thesubjective reality (on a tiny scale), and the outer physical condition,manifesting as a weakness or as imperfections; these, in their turn, are atendency from a previous life, a predisposition, an hereditary lesion or alatent difficulty, based on earlier life interests or malpractice. Bring thesetwo major determining factors together and—under the law—you will inevitablyhave some visible manifestation of physical disease or difficulty; this can beserious or relatively unimportant; it can be dangerous to life or capable ofproviding only temporary discomfort. No outer condition alone is adequate toproduce disease, but the difficulty is that modern medicine does not yet permitthe hypothesis of hidden cause except those superficial ones such as, forinstance, that worry and intense anxiety can aggravate existing heart trouble.It does not yet permit of those factors which trace back to an earlier life. Inthe case of contagious [311] diseases, the inner cause is of group origin, andhas therefore an outer group effect and is an expression of group karma. Thedifficulty of the matter is consequently great.There must be, as you perceive, two existing factors, and these, when relatedand stimulated, produce the appearance of disease. It should be remembered thatthe question of the soul’s choosing of a body and the type of vehicle whereincertain types of lessons can be learned and certain educative experiencesmastered, is a little-understood theme. In connection with this, I would remindyou that disease is often a mode of clearance and ultimately beneficent in itseffects. It is the working out into manifestation of an inner undesirablefactor, and when the inner and the outer causes are brought out into the clearlight of day they can be handled, understood and often dissipated and endedthrough the tribulation of disease and suffering. But this is a hard saying.On Certain Types of Disease.Arthritis and diabetes are both diseases which have their origin in the astralbody, but if I might put it so inadequately, arthritis is primarily moreobjective than diabetes, being the result of the satisfaction of physical desireas it expresses itself through food, either in this life or the previous one.There would be little or no arthritis if the race ate with correctness andunderstood the proper food values and effects. Diabetes is more definitely theresult of wrong inner desires, and is not so definitely the result of wrongouter desires. These may originate in this life, as I have said above, or beinherited from a previous existence. In this latter case, the incarnating soulchooses a family in which to be born, which will endow it with a body having atendency or a natural predisposition to this disease.[312] There lies here a vast field of investigation; isolation must be made ofthe types which easily fall a prey to certain group diseases.Syphilis and arthritis fall into the category of diseases which are largelybased upon the satisfaction of physical desire. Cancer and diabetes are moredefinitely in the class of diseases which are connected with inner emotionaldesires and the violent suppressed wish-life of many. The infectious diseases,such as measles and scarlet fever, smallpox or cholera are, curiously enough,definitely group diseases and are definitely allied with the mental nature. Thiswill surprise you but so it is.A student with some insight into occult causes might suppose that when peopleare changing their focus of attention from the physical nature to the emotional,or from the emotional to the mental, that they become liable to acquire theancient diseases, such as syphilis and cancer, which the Lemurians acquired.This is not so.I would remind you that people do not incur these diseases because they made ashift in their consciousness, but through misuse of certain God-given powers.The shift in awareness and the disease are not remotely related to each other. Iwould remind you, as well, that today people are a blend of the three states ofenergy which we call physical, emotional and mental, which are the Lemurian, theAtlantean and the Aryan states of consciousness. Scarcely anyone today is a puretype, i.e., predominantly one or the other. They are usually a mixture of allthree. You will find it difficult to find a person or a patient “changing hisfocus of attention from physical to emotional.” He will be either emotional ormental, and at brief times, and from a purely physiological standpoint,physical. The clearest lines of demarcation are to be seen in the case ofdisciples who are definitely and consciously endeavouring to [313] shift theirfocus of attention on to the mental plane. Nevertheless, they live predominantlyin a region which we call kama-manasic, which means both astral and mental. Itis an intermediate level of consciousness. Only broad generalisations aretherefore possible. Such a generalisation is that syphilitic conditions are moregenerally physical in their origin than cancer. Clear lines of demarcation arenot possible, and you must always remember that certain diseases may work out ina particular incarnation which have their origin in a very distant past; theseeds of the condition have lain dormant in the so-called permanent atom forages. They may not be rooted in the tenor or quality of the present life at all.Suddenly they spring to life and influence the present incarnation, andincidentally, proffer opportunity for release.On Fever.Fever is simply indication of trouble and is a basic way of purification and ofelimination. It is an indicator and not a disease in itself. Ponder on this, andapply it on all planes, for physical plane fever has its astral and mentalcounterparts. It is overexcessive energy which burns up and, in burning,relieves and cures (either through the subjugation of the germ or group ofenergies which caused it or by the releasing power of death). Where possible,and when the physical body is strong enough to stand the strain, it is well tolet the fever have its way for a time, for it is nature’s cure of certainundesirable conditions. Fevers not only give warning of the presence of thatwhich causes distress, but have in themselves definite therapeutic value. Butcareful watching and balancing will be required—balancing against the energiesof the body. Whilst the fever is rampant, the body is rendered relativelyfutile, and its normal activities are affected. As to the cure and the correct[314] treatment of fevers, much is known by the orthodox medical profession, andthis knowledge will suffice until such time as the causes of fevers are betterunderstood and physicians can work with the cause and not with the effect.Over-emotionalism is an astral correspondence of physical fever and indicates arampant germ of desire which must be dealt with before the fever can subside. Anoveractive mind which is ill-regulated, very busy but futile in accomplishment,is the mental correspondence.On the Cure of Cancer .In all disease of malignant nature, there is a vital core or a living spot ofenergy which is absorbing, slowly or quickly, as the case may be, the life forcein the man. In the early stages of such a disease as cancer, the vital core isnot found until the malignant condition is established so potently that it isexceedingly difficult to do anything helpful. Yet the cure is only possible inthese early developments and then the cure can be effected, but only again ifthe will of the patient is invoked. Little can be done in cancer cases unlessthere is the intelligent cooperation of the one to be healed, for the onlymethod (which I may later elaborate) is to blend the directed will of thepatient and of the healing group together into one functioning unit of force.When this has been done, then the invoked and concentrated energy will followthought, under the ancient law, and so stimulate the area surrounding the cancer(that is, the healthy tissue) that the absorption of the weakened, diseasedtissue by the stronger tissue can take place. If the energy is directed to thecancer itself, the cancerous condition will be stimulated and the trouble manytimes increased. The curing of cancer in the early stages falls therefore intotwo parts: [315]1. The stimulating of the healthy tissue.2. The building in of new tissue to replace the diseased tissue which is beinggradually absorbed and driven out.Cancer always makes its appearance before there is transmutation of theemotional force, for the reason that there are few disciples (and thereforestill fewer of the ordinary and majority of people) who have so transmutedemotion. This condition of freedom from emotion is so seldom to be found that—atthis stage of the world’s history—it may be said that it does not exist.No one who is an integrated and actively functioning person is ever as prone tosuch a disease as cancer, or any disease, as is the emotional type; he is farmore prone to heart trouble. A full active life prevents such a disease ascancer, but not always. As the forces of life run more slowly, as old age creepson, cancer often appears, proving the truth of my primary contention. In dayssuch as these, wherein cancer is the second great agent of destruction andmortality (and if I am right that cancer is a planetary disease), then almostanyone is liable to it. Fear is the great predisposing factor. Inertia andemotionalism are, likewise.On Dementia Praecox.What is dementia praecox? Does the phenomenon evidence a family group tradition?Is there any clue in the fact that it first manifests itself in earlyadolescence? Is the general practitioner correct in placing it in the categoryof hopeless cases? These and similar questions are constantly asked by studentsand practitioners of healing.These forms of physical diseases which come under the general head of insanitiesare far more abstruse than is generally [316] realised. From the standpoint ofthe esotericist, they fall into the following relatively simple categories:1. Those where the difficulty is due to the breaking down of the brain tissue.Far more of these are definitely syphilitic in origin than is generallyadmitted, and I would remind you that, occultly speaking, that would naturallybe the case, for the physical sex organs are a lower correspondence of thenegative-positive relation existing in the brain between the two head centresand the pituitary and pineal glands.2. Those where the difficulty is due to the overstimulation of the brain cellsby some forms of energy which overbalance other forms and produce certainserious forms of insanity.3. Those where there is no real physical difficulty, no lesions or diseasedtissues, but simply a loose connection between the etheric body and the densephysical vehicle. Then obsession or possession can occur. Such cases arefrequently (I might say, usually) regarded by the orthodox psychiatrist andmedical man as forms of insanity; yet they are not truly so. If the afflictedperson can be put again “in possession of himself” by some understandingpsychologist, and this is entirely possible, then the trouble is ended. There isa pronounced tendency among the most forward-looking psychologists today, tohandle these cases on the hypothesis which I have posited, and that is adefinite improvement.4. Those wherein certain hereditary forms of mental imbalance occur. These formsof imbalance are caused by happenings in other lives and are in the nature ofpunishment or retributive karma. To bring this about, the soul deliberatelychooses for a physical vehicle that form which will have in it certain inheritedtaints, driven [317] thereto by the Lords of Karma when the soul is unable togrip its vehicle—as is the case in the unevolved; or with purpose and intent,when the body can be under soul direction because highly evolved. I am notlisting these different forms of insanity or imbalance under the variousheadings, as the theme is too complicated, and often there are severalpredisposing factors, and often only indications of trouble which may never cometo anything serious. I am only giving the categories, leaving to the researchscholar the task of eventually listing symptoms and assigning due cause, aftermuch experimental work. That time is only just arriving.5. Those in which the mind is unduly fixed and static and controls the brain sounreasonably that there seems only one point of view, one attitude to life, andno fluidity and capability of adjustment. Such individuals may suffer, forinstance, from what is called idée fixe, or they may be completely the victim ofsome obsessing mental thought. Such mental obsessions can range all the way froma mild fanaticism to religious mania, with its accompanying characteristics ofsadism, ruthlessness and general morbidity.Dementia praecox comes under the first and the fourth groupings and is a blend,usually, of the factors descriptive of both. It is inherited in every case and,if not apparently physically so, is then based on inherited astral conditions,which in their turn aid in determining the physical condition. It is syphiliticin origin (often carried over from another life) and is, in this particularlife, quite incurable.Its sexual basis is demonstrated by the fact that it manifests itself in earlyadolescence. The patient can, however, be greatly helped, in the early stages,if the symptoms are duly recognised and his thought life directed, and the [318]dynamic effectiveness of new interests is employed. A spiritual motivation andlike interests can sometimes retard the development of the disease; where thisis the case and the matter is handled from early life onwards, the worstclimaxes can be obviated. To the extent that the patient intelligently tries tohelp himself, and is protected also by the intelligent care of the physician, hecan offset the trouble a great deal, and particularly as far as its repetitionin another life is concerned.Many of these problems are intrinsically tied up with the past, and until thelaws which govern rebirth are given to the world it is difficult for me even toexplain the processes governing physical inheritance, karmic results, and alsowhat is called retributive karma. The recognition of the subtler forms ofdisease, and the aid of the psychologist in collaboration with orthodox medicine(which undoubtedly has its place, as, for instance, in the administration ofglandular correctives), plus right hygienic handling from childhood onward, willaccomplish much and gradually stamp out the mental and brain diseases which aretoday so numerous and so distressing.On Euthanasia.Some students are concerned over the organised effort to legalise euthanasia,and wonder about the placing of power of life and death in the hands of thephysician. At the same time, they are aware that there is involved also thehumane factor, in cases where no surcease can be given to prolonged suffering.To them I would say:The problem which a consideration of the proposed practice of euthanasiainvolves will not exist when continuity of consciousness (which negates death)is achieved. That means that the time will come, in the racial development, whenthe soul will know that its term of physical [319] life is over and will prepareitself to withdraw, in full consciousness, from the form. It will know that theservice of the form is no longer required and that it must be discarded. It willknow that its sense of awareness, being focussed in the mind nature, is strongenough and vital enough to carry it through the process and the episode ofabstraction. When that consciousness has been developed in man, and the processhas come to be recognised by the medical profession and the scientific studentsof the human mechanism, then the whole attitude to death and its processes,involving as they do pain and suffering, will be altered materially. Then theman whose time has come to die may avail himself of certain methods of releasewhich, from the average point of view, might be regarded as involvingeuthanasia. Modes of abstraction will be studied and applied when death is near,and the process will be regarded as soul withdrawal, as a process of liberationand release. That time is not so far away as you might think.Today, grave dangers attend the process of hastening withdrawal, and the legalsafeguards will require most careful working out, and even then grave andserious issues might develop. But some hastening of the processes of death is inorder and must be worked out. Primarily, however, the will-to-die of the patientis not based at this time on knowledge and on mental polarisation, or upon anachieved continuity of consciousness, but on emotional reactions and a shrinkingfrom pain and from fear.Where, however, there is terrible suffering and absolutely no hope of real helpor of recovery, and where the patient is willing (or if too ill, the family iswilling), then, under proper safeguards, something should be done. But thisarranging of the time to go will not be based on emotion and upon compassion,but on the spiritual sciences and [320] upon a right understanding of thespiritual possibilities of death.On Germs.How inadequately do words meet the need of truth. We use the word “germ” toindicate the source of some disease or the origin of some form. We talk of agerm or seed of life; we refer to the germ of an idea; we indicate thatintangible point of energy which results later in some kind of manifested form.It may be a thoughtform, a human being, or a disease, yet the same word has tosuffice for all three. How oft have I told you that all is energy and there isnaught else. A germ is a point of energy having within it certain livingpotentialities, causing certain effects upon the surrounding field of energy,and producing certain forms of expression which are recognisable upon thephysical plane. But all that is referred to is, in the last analysis, some formof active energy that forms part of the energy available upon and within andaround the planet Earth.In relation to disease, a germ still remains a point of energy, but it might beregarded as energy which is not functioning correctly in relation to theparticular form which has become susceptible to its activity or aware of itspresence.Germs are the first effect of an original cause. Some few form a part of theplanetary evil, which means that they have a deep-seated and mental origin andone of such magnitude that the finite minds of men cannot yet grasp them. Suchcauses, for instance, may have their effects as a fierce and fiery and hotdevotion to an idea or a person, or they may work out as an equally fierce andfiery fever in the physical body, and to this fever, according to its symptoms,a technical name will be given by the medical [321] profession. The originatingcause is the same, and the effects in the personality will differ according tothe focus of the attention or where the emphasis of the life is laid. Ponder onthis for I have given a hint here of real importance.When I used these words, “the focus of attention,” I did not refer to any mentalattitude or to an attentive mind, but to the impact of life force in any givendirection, any locality and any aspect of the human body, where the directedlife energy goes. Germs are living organisms, great or small. They find theirway into the human mechanism through the medium of the life force which, in itsturn, uses the heart and the blood stream as its agents of distribution. In thesame way, the energy of consciousness uses the nervous system and the brain asits distributing agency. Where there is inherent or inherited weakness, therethe life force is not properly focussed, and there will be found some form ofcongestion, or some form of arrested development, or some form of predispositionto disease. When this is the case, germs can find a fruitful place in which todisplay their malignant activity. When the vitality is great and the life forcehas free and unimpeded circulation, then there will not be thesepredispositions, the germ cannot find a lodging, and there will not be the riskof infection.For instance, scarlet fever is contagious, but not all those exposed to itsuccumb. The ability to throw off infection and immunity from contagiousdiseases is largely a matter of vitality (perhaps vitality in particular areasof the body where the focus of the attention and the emphasis of the life forcemay be found). It can also be based upon the activity of the blood corpuscles,which serves to keep the blood stream in good condition.[322] This focus and emphasis is the same in connection with animals, for it isnot the focus of the mind but of the life energy within the physical body. This,when present and positive, protects. When it is negative and weak, it leaves thephysical body (human and animal) open to the dangers of infection.I cannot explain more fully than this, for the problem of origin and methodremains an insoluble problem just as long as man remains equipped with hispresent mental approach and emotional reaction to pain and disease, and just aslong as he places the same exaggerated emphasis upon form life. When a bettersense of proportion has been developed, and men are beginning to think in termsof the soul and purposes and destiny, then disease, as we know it, will fallinto two major categories:1. Those which produce purification and necessitate a period of retuning and ofrest for the body, preparatory to continued life on earth.2. Those which produce the withdrawal or abstraction of the soul in its twoaspects—livingness and consciousness.On Inoculations .“What is the standing or value of inoculation or vaccination from an occult oresoteric standpoint?” This question is often in the minds of healers as they askthe further question which is the real basis of their interest, “Does it affectthe subtler bodies? How?”There is no occult standard or value in inoculation, any more than there is anoccult standard or value in giving a hypodermic injection. The entire questionconcerning serums and inoculations has been tremendously overemphasised by theso-called occult students. The human body, at [323] the present time, is therecipient of such a vast amount of substance, extraneously precipitated into theinterior of the body, that the whole subject is of vaster import, yet of lesserimportance, than men think. Such is the paradox which I present to you. Wrongfood of every kind, the inhalation of smoke down the centuries, the breathing inof tainted air, the taking of medicines and pills and tablets of every possibledescription, the rifling of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms in search oftheir ingredients, and the injection of mineral substances, of drugs and ofserums, till one wonders sometimes at the remarkable assimilative powers of thehuman frame.In all fairness, however, I would remind you that, as far as the physicalwell-being of man is concerned, these methods and techniques of the West haveresulted in the production of a healthier race than in the East, in a verydefinite prolongation of human life, and in the elimination of many direphysical scourges which used to take their toll of man. This I, an Oriental, doadmit. I have stated the situation thus in order to expand your view from thespecific to the whole.In relation to disease and inoculation, I would remind you that there are threegroups of diseases which are not peculiar to man, but which are indigenous inthe planet itself. These diseases are found in widely differing forms, in allthe kingdoms in nature. These three families or groups of diseases are:1. The great cancer group of diseases.2. The syphilitic group.3. Tuberculosis.Most of the objections made by doctors with occult tendencies are basedunconsciously on a feeling that there [324] should be higher methods ofcontrolling diseases in man than by injecting into the human body substancetaken from the bodies of animals. That is most surely and definitely correct,and some day it will be demonstrated. Another reaction on their part is one ofsensitive disgust, again largely unrecognised. A more vital objection should bebased on the suffering entailed on the animals providing the vaccine and othersubstances.The effect on the inner bodies is practically nil, and far less than thediseases themselves. Herein lies for the future a most interesting question. Howfar do diseased conditions in the human body carry through and affect the innerbodies from the structural angle? It is a question I do not intend to answer.The controlling of modern disease is being handled by modern medicine primarilyin three ways: through the science of sanitation, through preventive medicine,and through inoculation. These are the lower correspondences to methods ofactivity emanating from the astral plane, from the etheric levels, and from theearth itself.The science of sanitation, the use of water, and the growing knowledge ofhydrotherapy are the precipitation on earth of certain inner activities on theastral plane of a most definite nature. From the angle of the aspirant, thesemethods are called purification.The science of prevention (both of diseases and of death) is the precipitationon earth of certain modes of procedure on the etheric plane whereby forces arecorrectly used and certain destructive agencies are controlled and preventedfrom going the destructive way.The science of inoculation is purely physical in origin and concerns only theanimal body. This latter science will shortly be superseded by a highertechnique, but the time is not yet.[325]On Glands.“Is it possible by certain types of meditation to stimulate either one of thepost or ante lobes of the pituitary body, when there is a minus functioning?Will a meditation designed to integrate the personality automatically adjust thetrouble and bring about proper pituitary activity? Will this also adjust andbalance the activity of the other important glands?”You have here several questions; the whole matter is too vast for properhandling within the available time and limits.I would say, however, very briefly, that the stimulation of either lobe of thepituitary body, and equally the stimulation of any of the glands by meditation,undertaken by neophytes, is a most dangerous undertaking. It can be done, but itis not an advisable proceeding except under the expert supervision of some ofthose who know more than you know and who can see more than you can see. Theglands are the result of the activity or the inactivity of the centres orchakras in the body, and parallel their development. This development isdependent upon the ray and the point in evolution. The subject is vast anddifficult, and I would have you all remember that constant dwelling upon thephysical factors to be found in the personality equipment is not the way of thedisciple. He must aim, as you suggest, at personality integration and at thegoal of being a pure channel for the soul. Such an integration is the result,normally achieved, of1. Character-building.2. Soul contact through meditation.3. Life expression through service.[326] The practice of these three, over a long period of years, will inevitablyproduce the desired results as far as the glandular equipment is concerned, andas far as the total mechanism can stand the pressure of the soul requirements,as they must be met in each specific life.On the Vital Body.“What are the principal factors that can be complied with in order to build astrong healthy vital body? Is it possible for a person with a rather weak vitalbody to strengthen it? May not a so-called weak vital body be a healthy one atthe same time, the weakness manifesting in non-staying power and a slowness inrecovery from fatigue?”This question is concise and can be briefly answered. In fact it must be, orotherwise a long discussion will be necessary upon the subject of the vitalbody, and that is too vast a one with which to deal here, and the implicationsare too many. I have given you much in the various books I have written.When you say a weak vital body I presume you mean one which is looselycoordinated with the physical vehicle and loosely connected, and which hastherefore a weak hold upon the outer form, for it is the close integration ofthe etheric body with the physical form which is the cause of all its stayingpower. You are right in your belief that one can be perfectly healthy but havelittle resistance to fatigue.The principal factors in re-establishing or making a better etheric control are:1. Sunshine.2. Careful diet, with the emphasis upon the proteins and vitamins.3. The avoidance of fatigue and worry.[327] Against all the above, at this time, climate, world conditions,environment and our civilisation militate, and the individual has therefore toresign himself to a state of affairs which lies outside his individual control.A normal, sane, regulated life is the best means for establishing a bettermeasure of vitality. This is, I presume, what you mean. You need to remember,however, that where there is a devitalised etheric body, and conditions are suchthat a re-establishment of a vital control seems difficult or impossible, theremust be recognition of karmic limitations and a willingness to submit to themand leave affairs to work themselves out. This particular life is not the onlyone there is. Frequently, therefore, in any particular incarnation, conditionscannot be changed, and are prolonged by inner rebellion and revolt. A disciplehas to learn the lesson of going on, as the expression is, in spite of and notbecause of circumstances.On Prana .You can discover much on the nature of prana if you use the books which youpossess and should possess. In my book A Treatise on Cosmic Fire and in A.A.B.’sbook The Light of the Soul ,* the whole subject is considered.* A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . Pages 77-116. The Light of the Soul. Pages77,217-225, 280-282, 328-330, 332.Suffice it to say that:1. There is nothing in manifestation except energy, taking form, using andactuating forms and dissipating forms.2. This energy is divided into three types of so-called electrical phenomena,called in The Secret Doctrine and in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , fire byfriction, solar fire, and electrical fire.[328] 3. Prana is the name given to the energy which is drawn upon the physicalplane from the etheric aspect of all phenomenal life. That etheric aspect of thedivine energy is a synthesis of energies. If the energy in which an individualprimarily lives and moves and has the focus of his being is, for instance,predominantly astral, then the major expression of energy in his equipment willbe astral or emotional feeling energy. He will react all the time to physicalenergy or prana and to astral energy or the many sentient emotional forces.These work out pre-eminently through the spleen, the solar plexus and thethroat, and affect in different ways the physical spleen, the stomach and thethyroid gland.4. Interest in these two types of energy, when evidenced by an individual, isbased on the fact that they are the two in which he himself is habituallyimmersed and to which he most easily and normally responds.5. The current of energy used in healing will be a synthesis of the energieswith which the healer normally works, with that type of energy predominatingwhich is, for him, the paramount energy of his life. The average unintelligenthealer is usually simply a transmitter of prana itself, which is the energy ofthe planet. This combines with the etheric physical energies of the patient,passing through the healer’s body. These stimulate the patient sufficiently sothat he is enabled to throw off the enfeebling disease. Some healers can workwith that type of force and with emotional energy blended, and produce activity,therefore, not only in the patient’s physical body but also in his astral body.This brings about serious difficulties at times and often hinders true physicalhealing, on account of the astral turmoil produced. On this matter, I cannothere enlarge, and there is no time for a longer elucidation at this time. [329]Mental healers (true mental healers who are rare indeed) blend soul energy withthe two above mentioned forces and this produces a synthesis of the personalityforces. Carried forward intelligently, this synthesis brings about the healingof the person through the production of definite organisation and alignment.Soul healing supersedes the three above mentioned methods, and produces thepouring into and through the mechanism of the patient of pure soul energy. Itwas in this way that Christ worked, and there are few today to work this way. Itmust be held before you, however, as an objective.Physical healing by prana is very common. It is often temporarily effective, butit concerns and deals only with effects and never touches causes. The diseasecan therefore be abated, but never cured. The power to heal mentally is on theincrease and produces relatively permanent effects. But astral healing is rareand very seldom successful. The potency of the astral nature of the healer andalso of the patient, and its usually unregulated condition, is too great foreffective work, owing to the polarisation of humanity at this time and to thelack of correct emotional poise and control.On Oriental and Occidental Bodies.The question is also often in the minds of some healers whether there is adifference in the causes of disease and the effects as experienced in orientalor occidental bodies. To them I would say:Humanity is one and the same all over the world, and both eastern and westernbodies are prone to the same diseases and manifest the same symptoms; all sufferfrom tuberculosis, from cancer and the sexual taints; all die frequently [330]from pneumonia and influenza. Through sanitation and other curative methods,carried out on a large scale, ancient diseases (inherited from old Atlantis)such as bubonic plague and cholera, are being slowly stamped out. They stillcrop out in the East owing to the strength of the ancient civilisations, thelack of food, of sanitation, and the dense crowding. They are also climaticdiseases and perish in the colder air of the north. Certain diseases are theresult of wrong diet, used over unnumbered centuries.One of the main reasons for the apparent difference (if there is any) may liealso in the greater age of the oriental races. The diseases of old age, andthose of youth or middle age, have their variations, and Asia and its peoplesare very, very old. The body stock is wearing out fast. Yet the Japanese show nosign of that old age. India is far older than Europe, but the Chinese andJapanese stock is older still, yet they demonstrate no such sign of effete oldage. The reason for this lies in the very different type of emotional body asfound in the Aryan or Atlantean. The whole question is incalculably difficult.I might answer your question, however, very briefly, by saying that there is nodifference whatever in the basic causes of disease in the East and the West.They are the same for the whole human family.On the Nervous System.In the right understanding of the relationship of the etheric or vital body(with its major and minor centres and its network of nadis) to the nervoussystem of the human body, two great aspects of soul activity can be grasped.First, that aspect of soul life which enables the soul to motivate and forceinto incarnation and activity the physical [331] mechanism, the body, throughthe galvanising activity of what we call Life .Second, that aspect of soul life which preserves the physical vehicle in healththrough the free play of the pranic currents. The above is an attempt to expressa great truth in as simple a fashion as possible. The true significance of theabove statement embodies the next great step in the field of true psychology andof healing. The whole subject is profoundly interesting. Some of it I have dealtwith in the pages of A Treatise on White Magic (pages 18-50) and you would findit of value to study the matter there outlined.The general situation in this connection might be outlined very briefly asfollows:A human being is a combination of various types of force. There is the force orenergy of matter itself which might be regarded as the energy aspect, in itstotality, of the cells or atoms of the body. The word “cell” itself suggests, inits usual connotation, an imprisoned life, and life and energy are, for theesotericist, synonymous terms. This is the third aspect of divinity, expressingitself in humanity. There is also the dual energy which the soul embodies ortransmits; this might be likened to two streams of energy, which merge and blendto form one stream when detached from the body, and which divide into two whenthey enter into matter and form. They bring to matter, or to the aggregated celllives, the contribution of quality—consciousness and pure life. It might bestated also that:a. The stream of life-energy finds its way to the heart, the physical heart, andthere (via the physical permanent atom) it energises coherently the entirephysical body, using the blood stream as its major agency and channel of contactand communication between this central powerhouse [332] of life and theperiphery. As we well know, the blood is the life. This life activity is thefactor which gathers together and holds in form all the living atoms and cellsof the body. When that life thread is withdrawn by the soul at death, the livingatoms separate, the body falls apart and disintegration ensues, with the atomiclives returning to the reservoir of power, to the bosom of living matter fromwhence they came.b. The stream of energy which conveys the soul quality of intelligence, pluslove-wisdom, and which constitutes what we understand as the consciousness, withits powers to contact, to sense and to rationalise, only penetrates as far asthe physical brain. There this second aspect concentrates itself or anchorsitself in the region of the pineal gland. From there in ever increasing potency,as the processes of incarnation and experience are pursued, the soul begins tocontrol, galvanise into purposeful activity, and to use the physical body.Remember that, to the soul, the body is only its response apparatus on thephysical plane and a medium of expression.It might also be pointed out, as a third necessary statement, that the soulpours its consciously directed energy into the dense physical body through themedium of the etheric or vital body. This instrument is composed of:1. Seven major centres of force and forty-nine minor centres. The major centresare found in the head and up the spinal column. The minor centres are to befound scattered all over the body.2. The etheric network which is composed of streams of energy, connects all thecentres into two systems—one major and one minor—and radiates out from thesecentres all over the entire body.[333]3. The nadis are infinitesimally small threads of energy or force fibres whichradiate out from every part of the network and underlie every part of the triplenervous system. They are found in their millions, and produce the sensitiveresponse apparatus through which we work and of which the mechanism of the fivesenses is one of the externalisations.The controlling power station will be found to vary according to the point inevolution reached:1. Low-grade humanity uses the solar plexus as the point where the basic energyis localised temporarily. There will also be found a slight activity in the ajnacentre.2. Average humanity works partly through the solar plexus centre but largelythrough the ajna centre and the throat centre.3. High-grade human beings, the intelligentsia and world aspirants use the headcentre, plus the ajna centre, the throat, heart, and solar plexus.Finally it might be said that the physical apparatus which is the direct resultof the inner activity of the centres, network and nadis, is the heart, theendocrine system and the brain. Into this general plan, very sketchily outlinedabove, all ancient medicine (particularly the Tibetan, the Chinese, and theHindu), with our modern western science, fits. The correlation of the westernand eastern techniques still remains to be made, and much will be gainedthereby. Further than this I cannot here enlarge, but the above will suffice toshow that the methods which you may discover in your reading (and their name isLegion) can all be brought into relation to this general scheme of energyprocesses in the human body.[334]On Diet.No set diet could be entirely correct for a group of people on differing rays,of different temperaments and equipment and at various ages. Individuals areevery one of them unlike on some points; they require to find out what it isthat they, as individuals, need, in what manner their bodily requirements canbest be met, and what type of substances can enable them best to serve. Eachperson must find this out for himself. There is no group diet. No enforcedelimination of meat is required or strict vegetarian diet compulsory. There arephases of life and sometimes entire incarnations wherein an aspirant subjectshimself to a discipline of food, just as there may be other phases or an entirelife wherein a strict celibacy is temporarily enforced. But there are other lifecycles and incarnations wherein the disciple’s interest and his service lie inother directions. There are later incarnations where there is no constantthought about the physical body, and a man works free of the diet complex andlives without concentration upon the form life, eating that food which isavailable and upon which he can best sustain his life efficiency. In preparationfor certain initiations, a vegetable diet has in the past been deemed essential.But this may not always be the case, and many disciples prematurely regardthemselves as in preparation for initiation.On the Spleen .The spleen is the most important agent of the life force, but it is the lifeforce inherent in matter itself, independently of form. It is therefore closelyrelated to the planetary physical body. It is the externalisation of a veryimportant centre.[335] There are three centres in the body (with allied externalisations) whichare basically essential to life.1. The heart centre and the physical heart itself. In these the life principle(the Spirit aspect) is located. Life and Spirit are one.2. The head centre and the brain in which the consciousness principle (the Soulaspect) is located.3. The pranic centre and the spleen, in which the life of matter itself (theMatter aspect) is located.You must bear in mind that, as H.P.B. points out, the dense physical body is nota principle. It is atomic matter which is held in form by etheric substance,under the control of the soul. It is automatic in its response, and reacts tothe outer world of impacts and inner impulses, but has no initiatory life of itsown. It is composed of units of energy, as is all else in nature, and has itsown individual life; its focus for the distribution of energy for this life isthe spleen.In the spleen, the negative life of matter and the living energy of the positiveetheric body, are brought together, and then a “spark,” as it is called, is madebetween the inner living bodies of man (through the medium of the etheric body)and the physical plane. It is a reflection on the lowest rung of theevolutionary ladder, as far as man is concerned, and corresponds to the relationof soul and body or—on a higher turn of the spiral—of spirit and matter.On the Vagus Nerve .There are two powerful centres connected with the vagus nerve: the heart centreand the centre at the base of the spine. These two, when brought under thecontrol of the soul, functioning through the head centre (the [336]brahmarandra), produce the raising of the kundalini fire. This, when takingplace, swings the entire nervous system into a special form of rhythmic activityand responsiveness, and it is through the stimulation and the control of thevagus nerve that this is accomplished. It is not the vagus nerve which isinstrumental in raising the kundalini fire, but the reverse situation. When thehead, the heart and the centre at the base of the spine are in magnetic anddynamic rapport, producing a radiatory effect, then they affect the vagus nerveand the fires of the body are unified and raised, producing purification and the“opening of all doors.”On the Eye .There is a certain school of scientific theorists who are working on the theorythat the eye is the declarative factor in the human body and the rule or the keyto its right understanding. They have already demonstrated much in connectionwith its declarative powers, where disease is concerned. They are on rightlines. Nevertheless, the science with which they are working is so embryonic asyet that their conclusions are not fully demonstrated nor entirely reliable.In the immediate future, when our planetary life is somewhat calmer, the wholesubject of Vision and the registration by the eye of the inner worlds willreceive an enormous impetus, and conditions—hitherto undreamed of—will berevealed. Man will enter into a new life and a higher era of understanding. Theteaching concerning the iris of the eye is an indication of this.Why not read up on the eye a little and note its occult correspondences to thecreated world, and to the whole problem of light? The eyes and the soul areclosely related and—speaking in the language of occultism—the right [337] eye isthe representative of the soul, and therefore the agent of buddhi, whilst theleft eye is the representative of the personality, and the agent of the lowerconcrete mind. You will find it interesting to read what can be found in TheSecret Doctrine and other books (including mine) on this subject; it will compelthe conclusion that here is a field of investigation hitherto unopened and ateaching which will warrant careful study for the sake of the group, if for noother reason.On Psychological Causes of Disease.Do “psychological causes of disease” register in brain symptoms before reflexingto other parts of the body? A sentence in The Light of the Soul has a bearinghere:“The brain, for instance, is the ‘shadow’ or the external organ of the mind, andit will be found by the investigator that the contents of the brain cavity havea correspondence to the aspects of the human mechanism found upon the mentalplane.”Bear in mind that the life force works through the heart, utilising the bloodstream, whilst the consciousness aspect works through the brain, using thenervous system. This is the first and most important point to grasp.Psychological causes of disease register in the brain or (if of a very loworder) in the solar plexus. They do not, however, make their presence felt assymptoms of disease in these places where they thus register. They are energiesor forces which—when brought into contact with the energies of the body—produce,as a result (and not before this point) those conditions to which we give thename of disease. The psychological causes are forms of energy, working outthrough the appropriate centres in the body, and these, in their turn, conditionthe glandular system. [338] The secretion or hormone, generated under thisesoteric stimulation, finds its way into the blood stream, and the result of allthis interaction can be either good health, as it expresses sound psychologicalcauses, or poor health, as it expresses the reverse.It is the internal relation between the subtler energies, working throughcertain centres, plus the related endocrine system, with its relation to theblood stream, that constitutes both the possibility of disease and its cure. Butthis recognition is still academically lacking. Much of the inherent psychologyis grasped, but a gap still exists between the physical and the etheric bodies,and little recognition of the etheric body is yet academically accorded. Thereis yet no real understanding of the relation between the inner psyche and theouter form, via the etheric body. The study of the glands has somewhat helped,but medical science must go a step further and relate the glandular system tothe inner centres.On Problems of Melancholia .These problems of melancholia are difficult to place and are due to a widevariety of causes. I will list them here, and the list may at some time serveyou.1. A sense of frustration, a thwarted wish-life, or a recognition of a basiclife failure.2. A sense of dramatics, and a desire to figure importantly on the little stageof a person’s life. This can often be quite unrealised and have a trulysubconscious origin, or it can be a carefully cultivated habit or attitude.3. A devitalised condition, largely of an etheric nature, which robs life of alljoy and desire and presents always a sense of futility. Many women passingthrough the menopause experience this.[339]4. A certain form of breakdown in the cells found in a particular area of thebrain.5. Based on fear of insanity and of death—a baseless fear which has nevermaterialised but which does constitute an idée fixe , so that the person is thevictim of a well developed thoughtform.6. A tuning-in, through oversensitivity, on the suffering and massed pain of theworld. Disciples can be temporarily overcome by this.7. This condition is very seldom brought about by any form of obsession such as“an earthbound entity or a living vampire-like person.” A very few such caseshave been known, but they are too rare to be considered a factor.8. Sometimes a person tunes in on a state of massed melancholia, such as can befound in our sanitariums or asylums. The condition has then nothing really to dowith him, but being sensitive, he identifies himself with those who aresuffering from acute melancholia.9. Melancholia, as a symptom of disease (not of brain disease) is also fairlyfrequent and will disappear when the disease is under proper treatment.A person may be suffering from a combination of such causes, as for instance acombination, let us say of the causes in 1, 2, 6.On Full Moon and Psychoses .One of the departments of esoteric medicine in the future will concern itselfwith the law of cycles, lunar and solar. It will then be demonstrated as a fact,what has always been suspected and is now generally recognised, that the periodof the full moon has a definite effect upon unbalanced people, upon the dreamingstate and frequently conditions quite [340] drastically, the neurotic and eroticconditions so prevalent at this time.The tremendous increase in insanity and imbalance today is due to three majorcauses:1. The transitional period of today producing a clash between the Aquarian andthe Piscean forces, has led to a condition which makes it very difficult forsensitive people to live normally at all. To express the idea in symbol: It isalmost as if the race, after habituating itself to live on the earth, had now toaccustom itself to live in water. I am talking from the standpoint of the form.2. The intense spiritual and mental stimulation which is being applied today tothe masses by the planetary Hierarchy. The intent is to bring to an end oldforms of living, to create new forms through the process of adjustment, and thusbring in a new civilisation based on a more subjective culture . I would ask youto ponder on this last sentence.3. The pouring in of more light from the astral plane (at present unrecognised)and also the tremendous increase of ordinary physical plane illumination. Thisproduces oversensitivity. The work done by the prevailing use of electric lightand the general glare in which humanity now lives, will exact its toll from therace until the human mechanism has adjusted itself to light . Remember that thisgeneral use of light is less than one hundred years old and is an occult effectwith far reaching results.I mention these three things because they are responsible for much of thepredisposition to sensitivity of an abnormal kind. Occult students well knowthat at the time of the full moon certain high contacts are easier than at other[341] times, but it is right here, my brother, that the difficulty lies.At the time of the full moon (over a period of five days) the moon and theplanet are the recipients of more reflected light from the sun than at any othertime. For this there is a subjective cause. I can only explain it to you by asymbol which may convey truth to you or which may act as a blind. Symbolicallyspeaking, the period of intensest meditation of our planetary Logos comes aroundat the full moon period each month; just as you have your daily meditation so Hein His high place, has His cyclic point of contact. This produces the pouring inof radiance and the entering in of energy both subjective and objective. For alltrue students, therefore, their work on the mental plane is facilitated; theyare enabled then to meditate more successfully and to attain realisation withgreater ease. They definitely share in the achievement of the Lord of Shamballa.The moon, as you know, is a shell, an ancient form through which the planetaryLogos at one time sought expression. It is slowly disintegrating physically butnot astrally as yet, and is therefore still closely linked with the astral bodyof the planetary Logos and therefore with the astral bodies of all people. Itsinfluence is consequently more potent at the time of the full moon upon all whoare unbalanced. This lack of equilibrium, which it really is, will eventually befound to exist between the astral body, the etheric body and the physicalmechanism.People who are definitely aspirants and people who are definitely mental, canprofit by these full moon cycles; those who are definitely unbalanced,positively astral, and emotional, and frequently swept by uncontrolled desire,are hindered, overstimulated, and psychically upset by these same cycles. Theveil of illusion is lit up at that time with a consequent result ofhallucination, astral visions, [342] psychic urges, and those misinterpretationsof life, of overemphasis upon aspects of life which we call phobias, lunacy,etc.I would like to make a suggestion here, which is not possible for me to prove toyou, but which the future will substantiate. The major diseases called mental,seldom have anything to do with the mind itself. They are:1. Diseases of the brain.2. Disorders of the solar plexus.3. Astral domination.4. Premature clairvoyance and clairaudience.5. Obsession.6. Absence of mind.7. Soullessness.This is, of course, a wide generalisation and has no reference to that categoryof diseases in which both mind and brain are involved. The diseases of mysticsare also in a different category. These latter diseases involve the brain ofcourse, indicate mental imbalance, produce various types of heart disease andthe diverse neurotic tendencies with which the saints of the world were so oftenafflicted.One thing I will add, however, for your encouragement. As the race, as a whole,becomes governed by the solar Lord, the sun god, the Soul, then the cycles ofthe moon will steadily lose their baleful effect and there will be a dying outof the various neurotic complaints and mental diseases today so prevalent. Thetime is not yet. It is not easy for me to give more information concerning themoon and its phases, as it constitutes one of the major mysteries to be revealedat the third initiation.[343] On Distribution of Force; Blood Transfusion.Instead of two questions, you have several. Let me list them for you so that youwill see what I mean, and for clarity in replying. Several of these questionsare inferred and not definitely posited, but if I am to deal with them they mustbe put in the form of questions and even then the subject is so vast that therewill not be time.1. How can a more harmonious distribution of force be accomplished for thebenefit of all?2. Can you give us some more specific instructions and indicate to us someesoteric methods, suitable to our stage of development in connection with thisproblem of distribution?3. Has the fact of blood transfusion...any correspondence in some process of thetransfusion of subtle energies on the inner planes?4. Are there some special means, besides what we are already trying to do, bywhich those of us who are on the second ray could more effectively transfuse ourlove quality into brothers on the first ray, and vice versa?5. What is the interrelation and the cooperation among the ray lives andparticularly between the first and second ray entities?6. How can the example of the close cooperation and friendship between theMaster M. and the Master K. H. be of practical help and inspiration to us?You will see from the above how impossible it will be to deal with this widerange of subjects. I will, however, give you the briefest answers to some ofthem, or indicate the line along which your ideas may flow.1. A harmonious distribution of forces varies in its arrangement andconsequently in its outer effect not only [344] according to ray types butaccording to the age of the soul, and the individual status upon the Path. Thereis a difference in this arrangement in the subtle bodies of the probationarydisciple and of the accepting disciple, and of the accepted disciple and foreach grade upon the path of initiation. This arrangement is brought about inthree ways or is subject to three forms of developing influences.a. Through the life of aspiration, as registered in the physical brainconsciousness.b. Through the spontaneous awakening of the centres and in their rightgeometrical progression. This I have referred to in some of my books, but morecannot be given as it is one of the secrets of the first initiation. Therearranging and the readjustment proceeds during the whole period of the Path,technically understood.c. Through the decentralisation of the whole inner conscious life. The serverbecomes:1. The mystical extrovert.2. The “one who steps aside from the centre.”3. The “one who lives upon the periphery of the heart.”4. The “one who hovers over the central lotus.”5. The “distant one who sees from far away, yet lives within the form of allthat is.”A study of these descriptive phrases may give you the clue to the rightdistribution of energy.2. The second question is somewhat answered in the above brief statement. I amdoing what I can in my personal instructions (Discipleship in the New Age Vol. I& II) to all of you to bring about two things:a. Clear the field of the personality life so that the higher energies can havefreer play.[345]b. Bring about those conditions and orientations which will produce harmonywithin, and consequently and equally, harmonious relations without. I wouldremind you, however, that the inner harmony of one brother in a group may not beadequate to produce harmony in another brother or in the group.3. Blood transfusion is symbolic of two things: First, that the blood is thelife, and secondly, that there is but one Life permeating all forms, andtherefore transferable under right conditions. It is also a synthetic act ofservice. Ponder on this.4. Your question gives me an opportunity to point out that even an understandingof, and interest in, the ray types (as represented for instance in a group) mayitself lead to a subtle separative attitude. There is no necessity for any Sonof God in incarnation upon the physical plane or in the three worlds to“transfuse” his ray quality into his brother. These ray qualities are shared byall alike, and a brother’s own soul—differing in no way from another soul—willeffect the needed transmutation or transfusion into the personality life. Onemay facilitate the process by providing those conditions of harmony and peacewherein a brother is faced with as few contrary attitudes as possible, and wherethe interplay of love may produce an effective stimulation. But this is nottransfusion. What exists in you exists in all, and the love quality (above allother qualities) is the dominant characteristic of all rays.5. This question is not only one of the mysteries of the occult sciences, but itis of far too vast a nature in its implications and too complicated a problemfor me to deal with in this place.6. The relationship of the two Masters you mention can be studied in twoways:[346]a. Through a consideration of the effective working relation which existsbetween the groups of disciples working under Them.b. Through a study of those people (and they are many) who have a first raypersonality and a second ray ego, or vice versa.In the last analysis, my brother, we bring about the correct distribution offorce, leading to harmonious relations, when we seek to live selflessly. For theprobationer, this means an imposed selfless activity upon the physical plane.For the accepted disciple, it involves a life free from all selfish,self-centered emotion, and of these self-pity and self-dramatisation areoutstanding examples; for the initiate it means a mental attitude which isdevoid of selfish thought, and free from the dramatisations in thought of theego.On Suffering.Suffering, in the last analysis, is only possible when the soul is identifiedwith the body, or rather, when the spiritual aspect of the soul (in the body) isidentified with the animal soul, which informs and vitalises the form andconstitutes its temporary life. During unconsciousness, the animal soul is awareof pain and suffering, and those who nurse and watch know this well, but thereis no real pain or true distress because the real man, the spiritual soul, hasbeen driven away either by excessive pain (as in true unconsciousness) or bynarcotics.The suffering of the soul, when the personality goes astray, is only a symbolicform of words. There is no pain or true suffering, and frequently no knowledgeof the happening, for the vibration is not high enough to penetrate into thathigh plane where dwells the soul. Where, however, [347] there is such knowledge,the soul experiences, if I might so express it, a sense of lost opportunity, andtherefore a sense of frustration, but it is not more than that, for the patienceof the soul, as of the Hierarchy, is illimitable. Just because we speaksymbolically and say the soul suffers, you must not interpret it in ordinaryterms.The suffering of Christ or of the planetary Logos or of God Himself, is notcomprehensible in terms of personality reaction. We use the words, but theyreally mean “detached and isolated identification.” Does that convey aught toyou, my brother?Wrong identification is the cause of pain and leads to suffering, distress andvarious effects. Right identification leads to understanding and comprehensionof the psychological attitudes of the sufferer, but to no true pain or distressas we normally understand it.On Planetary Energy.The sumtotal of energy remains the same for as long as a planet persists, withits forms and life expression. It is part of the great storehouse of energy. Itis the use and the effect of this energy, as it is appropriated by a form orforms of some kind, which we note as it is attracted from its own place to aplace where normally it would not be functioning. There it creates situationsand produces difficulties which are closely connected with a man’s karma anddestiny. There is a great abstracting energy which we call Death, whoseinfluence at a given time proves more potent than the united influences of thebody atoms and cells. It produces the tendency to withdraw and finally toabstract the soul energy which avails itself of these potencies in the processof discarding a vehicle on some plane or another. It might be said that theseeds of death (the germ of death) are latent in the planet and in the forms.[348] When powerful enough to be recognised, we call them germs, but thisconnotes a definite stage of almost tangible proof. When unduly potent, theyproduce acute disease and consequent death; when more feeble in effect, we callthem illness and note their purificatory effect. These contaminations (as theycan be called, though it is by no means a good name) are only such when thataggregate of energies which we call a man is brought in contact with thesecontaminating influences or types of ancient energies, and the reaction or theresponse is, from the angle of the comfort of the physical body, bad.On Transmutation of Desire.The point to be borne in mind is that desire dominates and controls action whenthe life force is focussed in the desire nature, as it predominantly is with themajority of people. But planned mental control is only possible when the life isfocussed on the mental plane. When this is the case, desire will not requiresuppression, because the power of the focussed attention will be elsewhere andthere will consequently be no furious desire to suppress. Suppression is aneffort by the man focussed in the astral body to bring in the will aspect of themind. But this he seldom does. The desire may pass off through the intenseeffort the man is making to achieve some mental consciousness, but nosuppression takes place really, nor is the will evoked. When a man’s life is runand controlled by the mind from mental levels, then transmutation does takeplace; transmutation (whereby the astral nature is changed and altered) may beof a spiritual nature or simply of an expedient nature. Desire may be transmutedinto spiritual aspiration or into an attitude which is in conformity to the willof the mind which is expressing it. Hence the necessity for careful analysis ofmotive and of objectives.[349]On Karma.I have already suggested to you that the entire question of karma is as yetimperfectly comprehended. A great Law of Cause and Effect exists, but oneparticular aspect of it has never been emphasised, and the knowledge of humanityon the subject of karma is very elementary. Karma has always been interpreted interms of disaster, and consequences that are painful, of error, of penalty, andof evil happenings, both for the individual and for the group. Yet, such is thebeauty of human nature, and much that is done is of such a fine quality and soselfless and so happily oriented, that the evil is frequently offset by thegood. There is everywhere, little as it may be realised, an abundance of goodkarma of a potency (under the same Law) equal to that which is regarded as bad.Of this, small mention is ever made. This good karma brings into activity forceswhich may work out as healing energies in any specific case. Upon these energiesfor good, which have been earned and are operating, the healer can always count.This is my first point. Ponder upon it.Karma is a determining factor, but unless a healer is an advanced initiate andso able to work effectively and intelligently on the causal levels whereon soulsdwell, it is impossible for him to decide whether any specific case will yieldto healing treatment or not. Therefore, the healer or practising discipleassumes in his mind the possibility of cure (which may be possible or not) andof the patient’s good karma, and proceeds to apply all possible aid. This is mysecond point.My third point is to suggest to you and to all engaged in the healing art thatmuch of the so-called disaster, involved in disease and in death (particularlythe latter) is to be found in a wrong attitude toward death, and to an [350]overestimation of the beneficence of form life. The release of a soul throughdisease and death is not necessarily an unhappy occurrence. A new and betterattitude to the phenomenon of death is essential, is possible and near. Uponthis I need not here enlarge. But I do seek to give you a new slant on thesubject of sickness and of death.Will you be astonished also if I state that under the Law it is quite possibleto “interfere with karma”? The great Laws can be transcended and frequently havebeen in the past, and increasingly will be in the future. The Law of Gravitationis frequently offset and daily transcended when an aeroplane is in flight. Theenergy of faith can set in motion superior energies which can negate or retarddisease. The whole subject of faith, and its vital significance and potency, isas little understood as is the Law of Karma. This is a tremendous subject, and Icannot further enlarge upon it. But I have said enough to offer you food forthought.As regards the lengthening of the span of life during the past century ofscientific attainment, I would point out that true techniques and thepossibilities of organised soul action are always parodied and falselydemonstrated on the physical plane by the earlier scientific activities whichare right in motive but which are only a symbol, on the outer sphere of life, ofcoming and usually future soul action. The life span will eventually beshortened or lengthened at will by souls who consciously serve, and use themechanism of the body as the instrument whereby the Plan is served. Frequently,today, lives are preserved in form—both in old age and in infancy—that could bewell permitted liberation. They serve no useful purpose and cause much pain andsuffering to forms which nature (left to herself) would not long use, and wouldextinguish. Note that word. Through our overemphasis on the value of form [351]life, and through the universal fear of death—that great transition which wemust all face—and through our uncertainty as to the fact of immortality, andalso through our deep attachment to form, we arrest the natural processes andhold the life, which is struggling to be free, confined to bodies quite unfittedto the purposes of the soul. Misunderstand me not. I desire to say naught thatcould place a premium on suicide. But I do say, and I say with emphasis, thatthe Law of Karma is oft set aside when forms are preserved in coherentexpression which should be discarded, for they serve no useful purpose. Thispreservation is, in the majority of cases, enforced by the subject’s group andnot by the subject himself—frequently an unconscious invalid, an old personwhose response apparatus of contact and response is imperfect, or a baby who isnot normal. These cases constitute definite instances of an offsetting of theLaw of Karma.The soul, through alignment, enters into a right use of time; or rather thebrain, which is the only time-conscious factor in man, is no longer the dominantattribute; the mind, as the agent of the soul (whose consciousness is inclusiveof the past, present, and the future), sees life and experience as it truly is.Death, therefore, is referred to as an episode, and as a transitional point in avast series of transitions. When this attitude of the soul is grasped, ourentire technique of living, and incidentally of dying, is utterly altered.In conclusion, however, and in apparent but no real negation of all that I havesaid above, let me repeat that the healer will give of his best to the one heseeks to heal. Having no clairvoyant power in the majority of cases, and beingtime-conscious and under the influence of karma, he will do his utmost along thelines of his own training and in accordance with the instructions given in thistreatise [352] on healing. I suggest that you grasp that the objective beforeany healer at this time and at this given point in the evolutionary unfoldmentof the race is the need, when so asked, to aid in the bringing about of healthto the body and its sustained experience in life. You need also to realise thatmuch that is believed, accepted and taught by the metaphysicians today is basedon wrong premises, such as the nature of matter, the time equation, the value ofform existence, and the fear of death. Seek to eliminate these attitudes fromyour consciousness, and you will arrive at a truer perspective as to the healingart.Later, in a few years’ time, we can probably begin to deal with specific cases.I seek, however, at this time to hold you to wide generalisations, and to basiclaws and propositions, and not to cloud the issues with purely physical planeoccurrences, temporary or chronic, or with death and destiny.No request for real aid must ever be refused, however. A deaf ear must not beturned to trouble, either physical, mental or psychological. But I would call toyour attention the fact that success in healing may not always mean release fromdisease and the so-called physical cure of the patient. It might simply involve,if physically successful, the postponement of the plan of the soul for theperson. Success might mean the correction of wrong inner attitudes, of erroneouslines of thought, and at the same time leave the physical body as it was. Itmight mean the placing of the patient (through wise teaching and patience) enrapport with his soul and the consequent reorienting of the life to the eternalverities. It might consist in the proper preparation of the person for thetremendous purpose which we call Death, and thus bring about the relief of painin this way.[353]The whole science of healing will shift eventually and increasingly into therealm of preventive medicine and the psychological adjustment of the individualwithin his group, and the providing of right living conditions, correct dietingand housing for the peoples. That, however, takes much time, and whilst the raceis on its way to the newer modes of living, with their resultant effects ofbetter health and a more correct comprehension of the laws of health, all whostand in the world as magnetic centres must proceed, according to the light thatis in them, to work with people, in order to help them, to heal them, and to aidthem in making needed adjustments. Nothing should stop your service along thisline, not even the realisation of limitation and of ignorance. Do all you can toencourage and to sympathise, to point out undesirable attitudes, to end wrongways of living, and change poor modes of psychological expression as far as yousee them and to the best of your ability. Remember, nevertheless, that your bestway may be far short of your future capacities, and remain ready ever to changeyour point of view when a higher and a better way is presented to you. Aboveeverything else in life, give to all who seek your aid the fullest measure oflove, for love releases, love adjusts and interprets, and love heals, on allthree planes.On Group Illnesses.In the last analysis, most of the ills of the body are rooted in some responseto group activity. It will be necessary for us to grasp the fact that the phrase“group life and activity” must include not only past heredity, or inheritedgroup tendencies, but also may indicate present world contacts, which weaken orincrease resistance far more than is generally believed possible. One of thecauses of cancer, which was not so prevalent in the earlier and more leisured[354] days of the racial life—for then the HERD instinct was not so powerful asit is today—is due to the increased stimulation of the body. This stimulation iscaused by our close contact in our daily lives with each other through ourmassed group existence, particularly in our urban centres. If cells are livingorganisms (which they are), they respond to group life, to massed cell emanationand radiation. This constant stream of energy pouring from the aggregate ofbodily cells in massed humanity may produce in certain types of people anoverstimulation in some part of bodily cell structure. This usually occurs wherethere is a weakness in the etheric or vital body, which means that cell defensesare impaired and the result is frequently a cancer or a general cancerouscondition. This is the fundamental cause, though modern investigation isoccupied with secondary causes and effects of this etheric weakness. I shallconsider this later in more detail. It will be obvious to you that when we beginto deal with the vital body and to consider it with greater understanding andknowledge, we shall be able to handle such diseases as cancer far moreeffectively.On Using the Mind and the Imagination to Develop Group Consciousness.When a member of a group, such as a group for healing, speaks of developinggroup consciousness, he refers to his particular group of brothers, and to hisgroup as a unit of several souls. Forget not that such a unit is in itself aseparative concept from the angle of the greater whole, but it serves a usefulpurpose in training the group members to think in those wider terms. It servesas a stepping stone away from the consciousness of the isolated personality.If you can indeed feel, think and function as one complete unit—severalpersonalities and one soul—it will then be relatively easy to extend the conceptto a broader inclusiveness, [355] to broaden your horizon and thus becomeinclusive in a much wider sense.The using of the mind to this end involves an aptitude to learn the distinctionbetween analysis and criticism. This is a hard and well-nigh impossible thingfor many to learn. Traces of illumination of this subject will show themselvesif the group persists in all earnestness. The members have to learn to respond,as a group, to the same spiritual, mental and human ideas, and thus swing—as a“telepathic unit”—into one united train of thought. They have, as a group, to bepreoccupied with the same things which are indicated by the soul of the group,and not by one person in the group, as is apt to be the case. They have tolearn, as a group, to hold the mind steady in the light—the group mind, and nottheir individual minds.In using the imagination to this end, you have to cultivate the power to ignorethe outer forms and to concentrate on the inner lines of light which unitebrother to brother, group to group, and kingdom to kingdom in the expression ofthe Life of God Himself. It is the creative use of the imagination whichproduces an integrated group etheric body and which enables you to see thisgroup body of force and light as one complete form and as one expression of thegroup intelligence, will and purpose—but not the will or purpose of the dominantmind or minds in the group. Thus these can work out on the physical plane inright expression. However, when the group members are primarily occupied withtheir own ideas, their plans, their problems, and how they can use whateverlight and knowledge may be received, they negate any possibility of suchcreative use of the united imagination. To become entirely free from this willtake much careful cultivation and self-surrender to the soul.[356]On Healing Energy.The question is sometimes asked by beginners: “Can we clearly distinguishbetween the healing energy, as expressed by the soul and by the personality? Canwe have some understanding of the part that love has to play in the art ofhealing?” I can answer with brevity.When we come to work as a group with individuals whom we shall seek to aid, weshall then learn to use the various types of energy according to the need of theindividual to be healed. It would serve a real group purpose if all of you wouldstudy what is said by Rama Prasad in his book, Nature’s Finer Forces , and byPatanjali in The Light of the Soul on the subject of the pranas with which andwithin which we work; you should be somewhat familiar with the matter.To answer the question specifically: An initiate or even a low-grade clairvoyantcan easily distinguish between soul and personality healing energies, but theaverage intelligent aspirant as yet cannot. The initiate knows the source fromwhich any type of healing energy may come. He senses its vibration and canfollow it to its emanating source by an effort of the will, directed by theintuition. The clairvoyant can see the centre from which the healing energy canflow, and the centre then indicates the type and quality of the projected force.All energy is from the soul in the secondary instance, but in the primary senseall energy is simply life, functioning under direction of some kind.As to the part love has to play in the healing process: Love is the lifeexpression of God Himself; love is the coherent force which makes all thingswhole (I would have you ponder upon this phrase), and love is all that is . Themain characteristic of the distinction between soul energy and personalityforce, as applied to healing, lies in [357] the region of the application andthe expression of love. Personality force is emotional, full of feeling,and—when in use—the personality is either conscious of itself as the healer, andis the dramatic centre of the stage upon which are two players, the healer andthe one to be healed. Soul energy functions unconsciously and is wielded bythose who are in contact with their souls and who are consequentlydecentralised; they are “off the stage” themselves, if I might use thatexpression, and they are completely occupied with group love, group activity andgroup purpose.Why then is it so extremely difficult, if not altogether impossible, for earnestwould-be healers to work together, as a group, with the sacred science ofhealing? Because as individuals and as a group they are predominantly personalin their individual and inter-group relations. This may show itself in intensecriticism of each other, or of oneself; in a vivid sureness of personalrectitude and sound judgment which does not permit those who hold it to see thatthere is perhaps a chance that they are not as correct in their ideas as theydeem themselves to be; it may show itself in a deep satisfaction over personalsubjective contacts. Any or all the above hindrances may be present and make thegroup demonstration a personality demonstration which negates constructive work,and any attempt only intensifies personality reactions and would greatly (andadversely) affect the personalities of those they might seek to help.How, then, should they proceed? I would point out that any group member who, asan individual, is free from the above frailties of the personality and fromthese attitudes, nevertheless knows (and rightly rejoices) that he participates,as a group member, in the group quality. That is one of the incidentaldifficulties of group work. To participate and yet stand free from weakness; torecognise that [358] the achievements or failures of the individual groupmembers are entirely their own affair; to share and yet not be dominated by thepowerful thoughts and ideas of the more potent members in the group is ever aproblem. I point this out because, in this coming Age wherein group work will hegreatly developed, it will be of value to understand group situations andproblems, and then to go forward to the group work together with those who areyours to work with. You will then be the better and wiser for past experiences,and fused as a group through shared suffering and limitations and the gainedability of failure rightly met.So let true love, silent, uncomplaining, non-critical and steadfast, be yourgoal and the quality of your group life. Then, when there is some definite workto do, you will work as a unit with hearts and minds as one.On Instantaneous Healing.Instantaneous healing may be of various kinds. We might cite the following fromamong several possibilities which account for the happening:1. The healing which is the result of a definite practice, conscious orunconscious, of Hatha Yoga. This is brought about by a projection of purelyphysical magnetism, which, added to the quota of available physical magnetism atthe patient’s disposal within his own physical body, suffices to effect animmediate cure. The magnetism in the body of the patient, instead of beingoutgoing and radiating, becomes inverted and turns inward to make itscontribution to the reservoir of physical force held in a static conditionwithin the body. The more low grade human types produce this kind of healingwith facility. This is equally so in relation to the patient and the healer. Thecase cited is a case in point. The healing was more easily brought about [359]by the “sheik” concerned because the wound (a bite in the arm—A.A.B.) wasself-inflicted and before inflicting it, the patient (if I may so call him) heldthe outgoing force in abeyance by an act of the will, thus creating a reservoirof energy which was available to supplement that of the sheik which was, in itsturn, released by a mantram. This is definitely not spiritual healing.2. There is also that form of healing which can be instantaneous because thedisease is largely psychological and hallucinatory. The healer is then in theposition to enable the patient to throw off illusion and so stand free. The willof the healer when added to that of the patient, aids in the breaking of theillusion and of the glamorous thoughtform and the patient then stands free. Thisis a psychological healing and only one illustration of it.3. Then there is a type of healing which is brought about in two ways, and thisis the true spiritual healing:a. When the patient makes a sudden and frequently unexpected contact with hissoul, and in which the soul energy is so great and so potent that it sweepsthrough the vehicles and definitely produces effects. Thus cures are broughtabout in some vehicle or another and frequently in the physical vehicle. Thephysical condition or disease retains, so oft, the undivided attention of theconsciousness of the human being involved, and the soul pours through to thepoint of concentrated attention. In this thought lies, for many of you, a clearhint.b. When the patient’s evil physical karma is exhausted, and physical planeillness is not, at this particular time, his destiny. Then the healer can beginto bear upon the situation, if he is spiritual and full of wisdom, enoughspiritual energy to ensure a cure.[360] I trust you will find these answers suggestive. Ponder deeply upon theimplications.On the Use of the Lord’s Image.Here we touch upon a point of real interest. The use of the Lord’s image isfrequently of vital importance, but—and it is here that I seek to lay theemphasis—it must be the image arrived at by oneself through the medium of theexpansion of the Christ consciousness in one’s own life, and by arriving at thestage of conscious discipleship. At that particular stage when a man isdefinitely linked with a Master and His group, he is then, automatically and asan individual, linked with the Master of all Masters. He can then, via his ownsoul and the soul of his particular group, draw on the force of Maitreya Buddha.Why, think you, is there no good and true picture of the Blessed One, There areonly a few speculations by the devotees of the early church and none by thosewho knew Him. The reason is a definite one. There is no true image of Himbecause it must be upon our hearts and not upon our canvases. We arrive atknowledge of Him because He is ours, as we are His. Do you understand thatwhereof I speak? He is the world Healer and Saviour. He works because He is theembodied soul of all Reality. He works today, as He worked in Palestine twothousand years ago, through groups. There He worked through the three beloveddisciples, through the twelve apostles, through the chosen seventy, and theinterested five hundred. Ponder on this fact, little emphasised. Now He worksthrough His Masters and Their groups, and thereby greatly intensifies Hisefforts. He can and will work through all groups just in so far as they fitthemselves for planned service, for the distribution of love, and come intoconscious alignment with the greater potency of the inner groups.[361] You will find (fairly soon perhaps) that healing groups will employmantrams of a definite kind, and that in those mantrams the name of the BlessedOne will appear. But the mantram for His coming age is not yet for use. Theworld is not yet ready for the potency which it would release. Today, is there amore potent mantram than the oft spoken word: “For Christ’s sake and for theglory of His Name”? But these works must be spoken with love and will behindthem or else they are but an empty symbol and a sounding cymbal. Forget thisnot.On the Christ.Some aspirants and disciples may experience an almost constant recollection ofthe Christ; that is due to their increasing sensitivity to the inner planes andparticularly to the fact that so much of the matter in the astral body of theadvanced aspirant is taken from (and is therefore sensitive to) the highestsubplane of the astral plane. It is also due to the fact that the Lord Maitreyawith His workers is approaching nearer all the time to the physical plane. Thefocus of His attention in the year 1936 was, for the first time, predominantlyon the first subplane of the astral plane. Hence the sensitives’ correct andimmediate response to His energy there expressed. He is coming nearer in Histhought and activity. Should the peoples of the world respond to the presentedopportunity, His forces and attention could penetrate more deeply and bepredominantly on etheric levels with all that is implied in such a situation.This, many sense subjectively and know; and great, therefore, is theiropportunity and yours to constitute increasingly a channel for this force.Remember that the work for which He comes and to which the attendant Hierarchyis pledged is to help Him in the “healing of the nations” as it is expressed in[362] the Bible. This is a true statement of an imminent fact. This healing willbe brought about if men of goodwill everywhere measure up to their opportunity;if the work of the Christ and of His helpers is brought more definitely to theattention of the general public, and if there is an inner relaxation in theworld of men which will permit the devas to work. It is their readiness andtheir response to the near approach to the Christ which many consecrated serversare subjectively sensing, and which has somewhat perplexed them. The devas canonly be sensed and felt: they cannot be approached by humanity as yet throughthe medium of the thought world and the use of the mechanism of thought in man.There is no danger involved for the server if he becomes aware of these devaforces and their activities, via the Christ and through their responsiveness toHis work and imminent appearance.On the Phrase “Mother of the World. ”The various ways in which the phrase can be used can mean quite a number ofdiffering things. It can mean:1. The feminine aspect in manifestation, symbolised for us in many of the worldreligions as a virgin mother and in the Christian religion as the Virgin Mary.It is that substance which enables Deity to manifest.2. Nature itself, the mother of all forms.3. The moon also, who is the symbol of the generative, creative life which givesbirth to forms and is therefore the symbol of the form nature.4. The concentration of the feminine force in nature in some individual infemale form who is then called the “World Mother.” Such an individual has neverexisted in our particular planetary life, though the avatars of a previous solarsystem, expressing itself through [363] planetary life, always took this form.But not in this solar system. The tradition of such appearances is purelysymbolic, inherited from the previous solar system from which we inherited thematter of which all manifested forms are made. This symbolism has come down fromthe far-off period of the Matriarchate, which had a religion that recalled theancient ways of the earlier system and in which period of time Lilith symbolisedthe World Mother, until Eve took her place.On the Sense of Futility .In connection with the work of the healer with patients at the gate of death, hemay experience a sense of futility. Is it possible to know just what he can do?Should he continue his effort to help the newly freed soul to go forward intothe light? In the face of all his knowledge (and he may have much), and in spiteof his yearning desire to aid the departing one, there seems naught to do but tostep aside, with a sense of utter futility, whilst the loved one passes throughthe gate which leads to what, my brother? We can go up to the gates, but itseems as yet that we can go no further. Even the deep-seated belief in thepersistence of the immortal soul proves inadequate, and only serves to comfortthe serving healer personally, but suffices not to reveal to him what help hecan give.There is little I can say as we wait, at this significant time, for the comingrevelation. That revelation is inevitable and sure, and such questions will notbe raised two hundred years hence. To this emerging fact, the growingsensitivity of the race to the subtler angles of life, and the vast amount ofinvestigation carried forward on every side, is the physical plane guarantee.This great truth and its guarantee is held steadily before us in the history ofthe “glorious resurrection of the Christ” and His after-death [364] appearance,and in the powerful but little understood ritual of the sublime degree inMasonry, wherein the Master is raised.Aid at the time of the “passing into the light” depends largely upon two things:First, the amount of close contact between the dying person and the one whowatches, and the level upon which that contact is strongest. Secondly, upon thecapacity of the watcher to detach and dissociate himself from his own feelingsand to identify himself, through an act of pure unselfish will, with the dyingperson. None of this is really possible when the bond between the two is purelyemotional or based upon a physical plane relation. The contact must be deeperand stronger than that. It must be a personal contact upon all planes. Wherethere is true soul and personality contact, there is then little problem. Butthis is rare to find. Nevertheless I have here given you a hint.There should also be as little definite thought process as possible on the partof the watcher. All that is required and possible at present is simply to carrythe dying person forward on an ever-deepening stream of love. Through the powerof the creative imagination, and not through intellectual concepts (no matterhow high), must the dying man be aided to discard the outer garment in which hehas been encased and in which he has laboured during life. This involves an actof pure self-forgetfulness, of which few as yet are capable. Most people areswept by fear, or by a strong desire to hold the beloved person back, or aresidetracked in their aim by the activities involved in assuaging pain anddeadening agony; they are dismayed also by the depths of their ignorance of the“technique of death” when faced with the emergency. They find themselves unableto see what lies beyond the doors of death, and are swept by the mentaluncertainty which is part of the great [365] illusion. There is as we know nosure touch in this process of dying. All is uncertainty and bewilderment. Butthis will end before long, and man will know and also see.As regards those who have passed into the light, whom you want to help, followthem with your love, remembering that they are still the same people, minus theouter limiting shroud of body. Serve them, but seek not that they should serveyour need of them. Go to them, but seek not to bring them back to you.It is physical plane life that is the purgatory, and life experience that is theschool of drastic discipline. Let us not fear death, or that which lies beyondit. The wise disciple labours in the field of service but looks forward steadilyto the dawn of the “clear, cold light” into which he will some day enter, and soclose the chapter for a while upon the fever and the friction and the pain ofearth existence. But there are other phases of life experience wherein the senseof futility and frustration meets the server in the world today.From the angle of vision of a disciple, we might divide intelligent human beingsinto three groups, at the same time eliminating in our thought the dead weightof the unthinking masses who register desire but who as yet experience no senseof futility or frustration. They desire and are satisfied; or they desire andare thwarted or jealous or angry at those who appear to have that which theywant and demand, and which appeals to the life of the senses. The three groupsare:1. Those personalities , integrated and intelligent, who are ambitious andpushing consciously forward, yet who meet with frustration. This frustration isdue either to world conditions which are too strong for them, or to theimposition upon them of their own watchful souls [366] which throws obstructionsin their way in order to lead them into the light.2. Those mystically inclined people and those rightly oriented visionaries whohave not yet built in that mental scaffolding which will enable them properly tomaterialise their vision, through right thought processes. They are many innumber today, and their case is not an easy one.3. Those disciples and aspirants who are attempting to work in the field of theworld, yet who through karmic limitation, misapplication of the law, or somebasic personality weakness, never achieve in this life their goal, and so areswept by an overwhelming sense of futility.Beyond these three classes, acting as the opposite pole to the strugglingmasses, are the integrated functioning disciples of the world, who areachieving, and who are too occupied and too one-pointed to waste much time overfeeling inferior or over mistakes and failures.Therefore, by wisely placing the people who come to you for help in one or otherof these three categories (allowing in your mind for the possibility of theirpassing into another and higher one) you will be able to help them moreintelligently.A large measure of the inferiority complex which affects so many people today isdue most definitely to their reaction to the inflowing spiritual influences.They know themselves to be greater than their achievements; they realiseunconsciously and wordlessly their divinity, but the limitation of circumstanceand the hindrances of the body nature are as yet too great for right response toopportunity and to reality. Look for these souls and aid them by trueunderstanding and by appreciation and cooperation, [367] and thus dispel theillusion of non-accomplishment which haunts their footsteps.But exhibitionism and neurasthenic hallucinations have to be cured primarilythrough individual self-effort, through decentralisation, transference ofinterest, and unselfishness. Neurasthenic tendencies are likely to increaseinstead of decrease for some time yet, such is the strain under which manlabours today. The present world condition forces him to find avenues of escape,and to revert to the curative power of his own creative imagination. Releasecomes through acceptance of the drama of the whole and not of the part, andthrough steady occupation in creative work on the physical plane.Methods of training will later be used and are already coming into theirelementary stages through the work of the psychologists of the world.On Scientific Parallels .Students seem to think that we, the teachers on the inner side, have read everybook that may be written, particularly those embodying the new and advancedtruths, and that we are also in touch with the personalities of those who arethe dispensers of the growing body of new knowledge in the world. Such is notthe case. How can I explain to you the true state of affairs? Only symbolically,I think.As we look out over the world of the intellect and carry our thoughts from thepoints of living knowledge there to be found, we may become aware of areas oflight (as we understand it) shining forth upon the physical plane. Such areasindicate the shining light of some worker in the field, of some disciple, or ofsome member of the New Group of World Servers. I know, for instance, that suchareas are to be found (as regards the United States) in Baltimore, Chicago,Cleveland and Rochester. By a peculiar [368] mode of shining this indicates tome that there is to be found a centre where the newer knowledges anent man’sbody are to be found. I know that there are other areas of light existing allover the world. My work and the work of all the teachers in this transitionperiod is to stimulate them and fertilise their minds with ideas. Every theorythey form in their search for truth, every book they write, and every conclusionthey reach is not known to us. They must carry their own responsibility and failor succeed in arriving at the truth through their own self-initiated effort.H.P.B. prophesied the work now being done many years ago when she spoke of therecognition ultimately to be accorded by science to an universally diffusedomnipresent Deity (the ether of space is an entity, she also tells us) and thatthe mystery of electricity, when solved, holds for us the solution of most ofour problems. Many of the theories of modern science are laid down in A Treatiseon Cosmic Fire, though scientists have not gone far enough yet to recognise thisfact; there the electrical nature of man is posited. You would find itinteresting and helpful to search out such passages. Science, however, gives noplace to the electrical force of the soul, which is steadily growing in potency.A few of the scientists among the most advanced are beginning to do this. Thenext step ahead for science is the discovery of the soul, a discovery which willrevolutionise, though not negate, the majority of their theories.Individual students might aid in this if they took some of the basic postulatesof a scientist whose researches appealed to them, and endeavoured to discover inmy books, for. instance, or in The Secret Doctrine , those paragraphs which willthrow occult light upon what he says, or which may negate his hypothesis. Thenthey would be growing [369] and using the analytical mind as a bridging factorbetween the world of human science and the occult sciences.On Ions and Radiation.Scientists have made statements to the effect that the air we breathe containselectrified particles positively or negatively charged, and they are able toproduce artificially electrified air; that even an open flame in a fireplaceionises the air; that with suitable apparatus one may extract either thenegative or the positive ions, and that patients exposed to the positivelyelectrified ions developed feelings of fatigue, dizziness and headache, while ifexposed to negatively charged ions a feeling of exhilaration was experienced;that positive ions increased the blood pressure and produced general discomfort,and negative ions lowered the pressure and brought a feeling of comfort andrelaxation.The question arises whether the healer’s radiation has the effect of ionisingthe atmosphere surrounding the patient. I must point out that to answer such aquestion accurately would necessitate two things: the revelation of one of themysteries for which mankind is not yet ready, and at the same time the giving ofan answer which would be quite inexplicable to you, for there is no terminologyadequate to the latent truth. In this truth is embodied the whole story ofduality—which is the story of the relation of the negative and positive aspectsof the living process. Certain things, however, I can point out:1. The negative and positive ions with which the scientist deals are etheric innature and, therefore, of the physical plane. These unseen particles ofsubstance which can only be traced through their effects and throughinterference with their activities, are rapidly moving particles in relation toeach other and, at the same time, [370] are themselves affected by a greatercontrolling factor which keeps them so moving.2. In dealing with disease, the patient can only truly be helped when thepositive radiation of the healer overcomes the negative condition of thepatient.3. The radiation of the healer has to permeate and overcome the resistance ofthe patient’s disease—not of the patient, who may be mentally and emotionallynegative to the healer, and therefore in a position to be helped. This is donethrough the more powerful radiation of the healer. The magnetism of the healeris then brought into play and, consciously and with intent, he can draw out anddisperse those atoms of substance which are the seat and source of the patient’sdiscomfort. A hint is here given of one of the future physical plane modes ofdispersing a disease. The power of directing definitely the magnetic currentsradiating from a source outside the physical body is not yet realised, but itwill embody one of the new modes of healing.The healing radiation, therefore, naturally affects the atmosphere around thepatient. As yet, however, that radiation is uneven and not rightly directed.Some people radiate physical or animal magnetism; others astral or mentalmagnetism; still others radiate the energy of a fully integrated personality. Afew radiate the magnetism of the soul, the major attractive energy in all forms.In the future the true healer must work through the radiation of the entirepersonality or of the soul. I say “or” advisedly, for there are few as yet whocan work with soul energy, but many who would work as integrated personalitiesif they so desired. And when a man has achieved this power to radiate, whatabout the patient? How is he to be brought into a condition wherein he willrespond accurately to magnetic [371] radiation? If he is an astral type, as areso many, will he be able to respond to the magnetism of a mental healer? Can hebe helped by the radiation of such a healer if he is himself a fully integratedhuman being? If you say to me that Christ healed all types, I would here suggestthat I am not considering in this short treatise the laws of healing as they arewielded by a Master of the Wisdom or by an initiate. My book would otherwise bea futile effort. I am writing for interested aspirants and for those who canheal on some level below that of the soul, but who as yet know not how to do it.Later all this will be more fully elucidated.On Vibration.Some students make demand that I define what is the meaning of the word“vibration” and state exactly what a vibration is. If I tell you that vibrationis an illusion, as sensory perception is known by the soul to be, do youcomprehend (limited as all human beings are by the reactions of a series ofvehicles, all of them instruments of perception) ? If I tell you that vibratoryreaction is due to our possessing a mechanism which is responsive to impact, Iam answering your question in part, but if this is true, what does it mean toyou and from whence comes the impact? If I give you the scientific definition(which you can discover in any good textbook on light, colour or sound), I amdoing work that you can do yourself, and for that I have no time. In my booksare several definitions of vibration, either by inference or defined, and theseyou might search for, and upon them you might meditate. If I elucidated for youhere the relation between the Self and the not-Self, between awareness, thatwhich is aware, and that of which it is aware, I am covering ground which acareful study of the Gita would aid you in comprehending.[372] Let simplicity be your guide and one-pointed love your major objective.Choose a field of service which has its definite limits (for all disciples arelimited and cannot cover a planetary range in their thoughts), and work—mentallyand physically—within those limits. The completion of some self-appointed taskwithin the field of karmic limitation and of environment where your destiny hascast you is all that is required of you. What are you accomplishing really atthis time? Let your service lie within the field of contact where you findyourself, and reach not out over the entire planet. Is there any greater or moreimportant task than to fulfill your task and carry it to completion in the placewhere you are and with your chosen comrades?Believe me when I assure you that I am not seeking to evade answering anyquestions, but if I can awaken you to the realisation of the necessity for“spiritual limitation” (as it is esoterically called when defining the career ofa disciple within the limits of his task) and bring to your attention the needfor achieving the goal you set yourself when you started to work, I shall haveaided you far more than if I had defined vibration or pointed out to you justhow much progress, through what process, you or others had made.On the Future Schools of Healing.These schools of healing are not to be developed in the near future, not beforethe close of this century. Only the preparatory work is now being done, and thestage set for future unfoldments. Things do not move so rapidly. There has to bea growing synthesis of the techniques of such schools, which embody:1. Psychological adjustments and healing,2. Magnetic healing,[373]3. The best of the allopathic and homeopathic techniques, with which we must notdispense,4. Surgical healing in its modern forms,5. Electro-therapeutics,6. Water-therapy,7. Healing by colour and sound, and radiation,8. Preventive medicine,9. The essential practices of osteopathy and chiropractic,10. Scientific neurology and psychiatry,11. The cure of obsessions and mental diseases,12. The care of the eyes and ears,13. Voice culture, which is a definitely healing agency,14. Mental and faith healing,15. Soul alignment and contact,and many other processes and procedures which belong to the healing art. Some ofthe more ancient schools, such as the allopathic, call for a process ofelimination in order to arrive at the vital and true contribution which theyhave to give. Others of a modern and tentative experimental kind must be liftedout of the hands of the fanatics; for until fanaticism with its blindness andlack of intelligent synthesis dies out (as it inevitably will as the sixth rayrecedes and the Piscean Age passes out), the new schools cannot exist as theyshould; there must be a keener understanding of the underlying and fundamentalgood in all the schools and a better grasp of the principles which underlie thetrue healing art, before the schools, referred to in Letters on OccultMeditation, can come into being. When, as is the case today, some healer orschool lays the entire emphasis upon some patent cure-all and despises all othersystems of diet or method, it will not be possible to establish the trueschools.[374] The period is coming in which we will pass through a cycle in which wewill garner the fruit of the ages; in which we will skim (if I may so expressit) the cream of the milk of human experience; and then with the best that thepast can confer upon us, we will inaugurate those new enterprises which willspeed humanity upon its way. Among these new enterprises the healing art will bethe foremost, because the most necessary.We shall find that the work which is engaging our attention will fall into threecategories: these will work out sequentially and not simultaneously.1. The training in the principles of the healing art, as wea. Lay the foundation for later expansion in the New Age.b. Seek to preserve that which is good and useful in the shift of the emphasisfrom the outer external man to the more subtle etheric and vital body.c. Study this Treatise on the new healing which will meet with a measure ofresponse, but which will only later enter into its true usefulness and mission.2. Later, when a group can function together with impersonality as a unit andwith true interplay of love, such a group can then begin to do some definitehealing work, taking some case, for instance of known physical illness, ofobsession, or of mental difficulty and—working under soul direction or someinitiated chela and in conformity with the teaching outlined in thisTreatise—seek to cure and aid. The study of the art of dying is also to attractyour intention and later that of the world at large.3. Finally, there will come the forming of subsidiary groups to be taught anddeveloped by the members of the pioneer healing groups, under soul instruction,or under [375] that of some initiated chela. These subsidiary groups will workunder group direction for the healing of people. This will not be for some yearsyet, and not until the initiating group (or groups) can work with a measure ofsuccess and the group members have an intelligent grasp of the technique andprinciples involved in healing. The exoteric developments of the New Age healingwill grow out of the above.There is no school in existence today which should be retained. All of themembody some useful truth, principle or idea. I would point out that a syntheticgroup would still be a separative and separated entity, and no such group is ourgoal. It is the synthesis of the life and of the knowledge which is desirable ,and not a synthesis of people. There will be eventually, let us hope, hundredsand thousands of groups all over the world who will express this new attitude tohealing, who will be bound together by their common knowledge and aims, but whowill all express this to the best of their ability in their own peculiar field,in their own peculiar way and with their own peculiar terminology. It is thesubjective life unity that is of interest to the teachers on the inner side oflife, and the production of a network of true healers all over the world.A fresh start is now being made. We shall and do inherit the wonder of the pastacquired knowledges and the use of much of it will persist; all that is neededis the elimination of the undesirable and the misunderstood interpretations ofknown facts, and the misapplied information, also the cessation of selfishinterest, financial exploitation and greed. Modern surgery, modern sanitarymethods, and modern medical science are full of wonder and usefulness.[376]Letter to a ScientistMy brother:I have a few minutes to spare this morning after dictating to A.A.B. and willattempt to throw some forward light upon the questions which you have posited. Ido not, as you will note, say that I will answer the questions.The discoveries of science are as yet inadequate for the fulfillment of theprophecies I made in A Treatise on the Seven Rays. Towards the close of thiscentury and when the world situation has clarified and the period ofreconstruction is drawing to a close, discoveries will be made which will revealsome hitherto unrealised electrical potencies. I know not what other word to usefor these electrical rays which will make their presence felt and lead topossibilities beyond the dreams of investigators today. The coming science ofelectricity will be as different next century as the modern usages ofelectricity differ from the understanding of the Victorian scientist.In connection with your query anent the photography which concerns itself withdeparted souls, I would advise you that understanding of process will come froma study of the photographing of thoughtforms. A beginning was made in thisconnection by the great French scientist, d’Arsonval, of Paris. A.A.B. can tellyou something of this if you do not already know. Light on the subject will comethrough this, through the perfecting of the plates of reception and theirgreatly increased sensitivity, and through the relating of electricity tophotography. You may deem it well-nigh impossible to make plates of much greatersensitivity than those in use in the best equipped laboratories. But this is notso. Along this line of thought-photography and electrical equipment, will comethe solution. It is the thought of those on the other side, and their ability toproject [377] thoughtforms of themselves, plus the providing of adequatelysensitive plates or their equivalent, which will mark a new era in so-called“spirit photography”. People frequently are so preoccupied with the tangibleinstrument on this side of the veil that they neglect the factor of what must becontributed from the other side by those who have passed over.The work will be done from there, with the material aid which as yet has notbeen provided in the outer scientific field.To bring this about, collaboration of a conscious medium (not a trance medium,but someone who is consciously clairvoyant and clairaudient) will be required.There are many such growing up among the children of today, and the nextgeneration after them will provide still more. The separating veil willdisappear through the testimony of the thousands of those who can see phenomenaand hear sounds which lie outside the range of the tangible.You say that the spirits state that they cannot stand electricity. What is meantis that they cannot stand electricity as it is at present applied. This is aninstance of the inaccurate statements passed on by ignorant mediums or by thosewho on the other side have no more understanding of the laws of electricity thanthey probably had in the physical body. There is nothing but electricity inmanifestation, the “mystery of electricity” to which H.P.B. referred in to inThe Secret Doctrine . Everything in Nature is electrical in nature; life itselfis electricity, but all that we have contacted and used today is that which isonly physical and related to and inherent in the physical and etheric matter ofall forms.It must be remembered that the so-called “spirits” are functioning in theillusory astral body, while advanced “spirits” are only functioning as minds,and can therefore [378] be reached solely by minds and in no other way. It willnever be possible to photograph the mental vehicle; only the astral body will besusceptible of photographing. The grosser the person in the body, desire andappetite, the more easily will he be photographed after passing over (if anyonewants to photograph him!), and the more advanced the person, the more difficultit will be to get a photograph.As regards the use of radio as a means of communication with the “spirit world,”the present electrical instruments are too slow in vibratory activity (if I mayuse such an unscientific term) to do the work; if astrally clothed “spirits”approach them they are apt to have a shattering effect. Yet the firstdemonstration of existence after death, in such a way that it can be registeredupon the physical plane, will come via the radio, because sound always precedesvision. Think on this. However, no radio now exists which is sufficientlysensitive to carry sound waves from the astral plane.Future scientific discoveries, therefore, hold the secret. This is no evasion onmy part, but a simple statement of fact. Electrical discovery is only in theinitial stage and all that we have is simply a prelude to the real discovery.The magic of the radio would be completely unbelievable to the man of theeighteenth century. The discoveries and developments lying ahead in thetwenty-first century will be equally unbelievable to the man of this century. Agreat discovery in relation to the use of light by the power and the directiveagency of thought will come at the end of this century or the beginning of thenext. Two small children—one living in this country (U.S.A.) and one inIndia—will work out a formula along scientific lines which will fill in some ofthe existing gaps in the scale of light vibration, carrying on from the highfrequency rays and [379] waves as you now have them. This will necessitateinstruments hitherto undreamt of but really quite possible. They will be sosensitive that they will be set in motion by the power of the human eye underthe focussed direction of thought. From then on tangible rapport with the spiritworld will be possible. I cannot do more than give you the clue.I am also handicapped by the complete ignorance of A.A.B. on these matters whichinvolve electrical knowledge and terms. There is no seed thought in her mind onwhich I can work or from which I can expand the idea. She can explain what Imean if you ask her to do so. But even if she had a training such as you have, Icould not explain clearly, as the discovery must first be made, and this willrevolutionise all present ideas, even whilst growing out of them. An ordinarytreatise on electricity such as is studied by electrical engineers would havebeen completely incomprehensible to even the most highly educated man twohundred years ago, or even one hundred, and so it is now. In the meantime, workwith thought photography as a prelude to the coming science, for out of that andthe gradual development of more sensitive modes of registering and recordingsubtle phenomena will come the new idea and possibilities. Does it mean anythingto you when I say that electricity and photography are closely related becausethe human being is electrical in origin and nature? This must be demonstrated onthe physical plane by the aid of the needed sensitive apparatus.February, 1944"},{"pageContent":"PART TWO - THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALING[380] We are now entering upon a new section of our discussion on the Rays andDisease. It is essentially far more practical in scope than the highlyspeculative section (speculative to all of you ) which we have just concluded.Much that I have there told you is, for you, in the nature of questionable truth(using this word “questionable” in its real sense; i.e., as promotingquestions). For the most intuitive of you, it was at its best a “possiblyaccurate” hypothesis. I would here ask you to note this phrasing, paradoxical asit may appear. You have no direct means of knowing how true it may be. A greatdeal of the mystery of life and of living will clarify as more and moreaspirants in the world begin to function consciously in the realm of causes.There is no questioning in the Hierarchy, except upon those matters which touchupon the unpredictable nature of human reactions. Even in connection with theuncertain activities of mankind, the Masters can usually gauge what will occur,but esoterically They refuse “to ponder on the energies released upon the planeof earthly living, for fear that counter-energies, issuing from the Centre whereThey dwell may negate the truth of man’s freewill.” I am here quoting one of theMasters, speaking at a conference held in 1725.[381] What I have told you in the previous section is to me unquestionable truthand factually proven; to you it may be an adequate hypothesis or a questionableand nonacceptable interpretation of the underlying causes of disease.Behind humanity lies a very ancient past, wherein so-called sins and errors,wrong-doing and wrong attitudes have piled up a very heavy karma which(fortunately for the race of men!) is being rapidly worked off at this time. Theimmense interest in disease which is displayed today, the focussing of all theresources of medical and surgical science on behalf of the fightingforces—(resources later to be mobilised in aid of the civilian populations ofthe devastated countries in both hemispheres)—the widespread research beingcarried on in our hospitals and centres of learning, and the rapid discoveriesof science, plus a steady trend towards a much needed simplification, willbefore long bring about major changes in the approach to disease. These willlead to the eradication of many of the dreaded inherited diseases.The inspiration and inflow of occult knowledge, via the disciples and initiatesof the world, will bring about many alterations in technique; the comingrevelation of new, yet most simple, laws of health, and the blending which willinevitably come of orthodox medicine, psychology and spiritual methods ofhealing, will produce an entirely new approach to the entire subject; theincreasing use of fire as a means of purification (both in relation to the soilof the planet and to the human frame) will do much. Of this, the technique ofinducing fever as a means of curing certain forms of disease, and the method(frequently employed by nature) of subjecting large areas of the soil to theimpact of fire, will be developed into a new and most helpful science. This,however, will come later. I indicate simply faint trends in that direction. Manstands—in all fields of [382] knowledge—at a climaxing point; this has beeninduced by the rapid unfoldment of the human consciousness, and it prefaces agreat expansion of the understanding and a new insight into the conditioningcauses which are responsible for much that today distresses man’s physical body.The new learning and the coming knowledge will arise as a result of an awakeningintuition, of the presence upon earth of a very great number of advanced anddeveloped souls, and the coming of the Hierarchy and Humanity into a closerrelationship. The blending (slowly going forward) of the energies of those twoplanetary centres will bring about major changes and unfoldments, and this notonly in the perceptive faculties of man but in the physical mechanism also.There will be a much greater resistance to the indigenous and inherited diseasesand a real ability to resist infections; this will eliminate much pain andsuffering. The reduction of the sum of human karma through the experience ofthis planetary war (1914-1945) will enable the souls seeking incarnation tocreate bodies free from tendencies to morbid developments. The Masters areentirely free from disease because they have entirely overcome the karma of thethree worlds and are liberated.The ability—developed during the past fifty years—to cope with the planetarydisease of tuberculosis will, when extended into the densely populated areas ofthe Orient and to districts suffering hitherto from inadequate medicalattention, stamp it out altogether. The syphilitic diseases are already beingbrought under rapid control through the use of the newly discovered drugs,though these are regarded as amelioratives only by the Masters, and assuperficial in time and space. Such diseases will be slowly and correctlystamped out in toto as humanity shifts its consciousness on to the mental planeand away from the field of astral and sexual desire with their reflex actionupon [383] the automatic and responsive physical body. The third great planetarydisease, cancer, is as yet basically uncontrollable, and the relative simplicityof surgery seems at present the only mode of possible cure. The mode ofpreventing the occurrence of cancer and the nature of its cause are stillunknown, and the entire field is largely speculative and still subject toinfinite research and investigation. Many minor ailments, infections and a widerange of allied physical ills will eventually be found traceable to one or otherof these three basic diseases; they, in their turn, are related to a definitemisuse of the energy of the three major rays. It might be stated that:1. The syphilitic diseases are due to the misuse of third ray energy, that ofthe creative, intelligent energy of substance itself.2. Tuberculosis is the result of the misuse of the energy of the second ray.3. Cancer is a mysterious and subtle reaction to the energy of the first ray,the will-to-live, which is one of the aspects of this ray. It works out,therefore, in an overactivity and growth of the body cells whose will-to-livebecomes destructive to the organism in which they are to be found.I have here only given you a hint, and one that is not of wide usefulness atthis time. A great deal of occult research remains to be done by the medicalprofession along these lines, but this will only be possible when the Science ofthe Rays is better understood and when the evidence substantiating the presenceof five basic energies in every human being (the energies of his fiveconditioning rays) can be ascertained; men will learn some day to determine withease their ray type, and the rays which govern their three-fold personality.[384] Along every line of man’s expanding understanding, the opportunity forthat which is new to make entrance and control is becoming increasingly evident.The door of adventure (in its highest sense) stands wide open, and nothing yethas ever succeeded in stopping humanity from passing through that door; down theages man has passed through its portals and has entered into new and richerrealms of investigation, of discovery and of subsequent practical application.Today, the door which is opening will admit man into a world of meaning—a worldwhich is the ante-chamber to the world of causes. Effect; Meaning; Cause. Inthese three words you have the key to the growth of man’s consciousness. Mostmen live today in the world of effects, and have no idea that they are effects.Some few are now beginning to live in the world of meaning, whilst disciples andthose functioning in the world of the Hierarchy are aware, or are steadilybecoming aware, of the causes which produce the effects which meaning reveals.It is for this reason that we can now start considering the basic requirementswhich man must meet before he can move forward along the path of futureenlightenment. This enlightenment will most necessarily remove all fear of deathand deal with that subject which has for so long a time driven humanity into thedepths of despair and of fear. I refer also to the required attitudes whichthose seeking healing, the surmounting of disease and the cure of bodily ills,must realise, and with which they must cope, principally along mental lines.These requirements will evoke the mental attention of both the healing agencyand the patient. They have reference also to man as a whole.It has generally been surmised that the main prerequisite to the art of healingis faith. But this is not so. Faith has little to do with it. Healing isdependent upon [385] certain vital and basic factors into which faith enters notat all. The effort of the patient to achieve faith is frequently a greatdetriment to his freedom from the difficulties which lie between him andcomplete healing. When Christ so frequently emphasised faith (or rather thatquality which is translated as faith in our Western Scriptures) He referred inreality to acceptance of law, to a recognition above all of karma, and to aknowledge of divine destiny. This, if grasped, will bring about a new attitudeboth to God and to circumstance. The prerequisites which I would like toemphasise might be enumerated as follows:1. A recognition of the great Law of Cause and Effect, if possible. This is notalways possible when dealing with the totally unenlightened.2. Correct diagnosis of the disease by a competent physician, and later by aspiritual clairvoyant, when that capacity is developed by the initiate healer.3. A belief in the law of immediate Karma. By that I mean an ability on the partof the patient or of the healer to know whether it is the destiny of the patientto be healed or else be helped to make the great transition.4. A willingness to recognise that healing might be detrimental and basicallyundesirable from the standpoint of the soul. People are sometimes healed by thepotency of the healer when it is not their destiny to resume active physicalplane living.5. The active cooperation of healer and patient—a cooperation based upon mutualunderstanding.6. A determined acquiescence on the part of the patient to accept whatever maybe the demonstrated will of the soul. It might be called an expression of divineindifference. [386]7. An effort upon the part of both healer and patient to express completeharmlessness. The value of this will repay careful thought. This has basically areference to the relation of both parties to their associates.8. An effort on the part of the patient (unless too ill) to adjust and put rightthose aspects of the nature and those characteristics which might militateagainst the right spiritual perception. This is one of the meanings hidden inthe phrase, the “work of restitution,” though not the most important meaning.9. The deliberate eliminating of qualities, lines of thought and of desireswhich could hinder the inflow of spiritual force—a force which might integratethe soul more closely with the body in the three worlds and inaugurate a renewedlife-expression, or which might integrate the soul with its emanating source andinitiate renewed life on soul levels. This, therefore, affects the relation ofthe patient to his soul.10. The capacity of both healer and patient to integrate into the soul groupwith which they are subjectively affiliated, to integrate in other cases bothpersonality and soul, and, if they are at a needed point of development, both tointegrate more closely into the Master’s ashramic group.These ten requirements may appear simple but are not so by any means.Superficially, they may appear to deal with character and quality and capacity;fundamentally, they concern the relation of soul and body, and deal withintegration or abstraction. The objective underlying them in any case is to setup an unbroken rapport between the healer [387] or the healing group and thepatient who is receiving the scientific attention of the healing agent—group orindividual.One of the first things that any healing agent will have to do will be thedrawing up of a simple outline of instruction which should govern the attitudeof the one to be healed. These instructions must be simple, because where realillness is present it is not possible for the patient to make the simplestphysical effort in order to institute any changed attitude. This is oftforgotten.There are one or two things which I would like to make clear and which you must,in your turn, make clear to the patient.1. Cure is not guaranteed. Patients must realise that continuance of life in thephysical body is not the highest possible goal. It may be so if the service tobe rendered is of real import, if obligations remain still to be carried out,and if other lessons must still be learned. Bodily existence is not, however,the summum bonum of existence. Freedom from the limitations of the physical bodyis of real beneficence. Patients must learn to recognise and accept the Law ofKarma.2. Fear is needless. One of the first objectives of the healing agent should beto aid the patient to achieve a happy, sane, expectant outlook upon hisfuture—no matter what that future may bring.It will be obvious too that there lies before you the opportunity to bring a newattitude to the whole problem of disease and healing and to train humanity in abetter and happier sense of proportion where disease and health are concerned.[388]It will also be obvious to you that the word “restitution” concerns the high artof restoring to the patient that which he needs in order correctly to facelife—life in a physical body and on the physical plane or the continuity of lifeon the other levels, unseen by the average man and regarded as problematical andintangible. Restitution may also involve the righting of wrongs by the patient,prior to receiving what he will regard as successful treatment, but it primarilyconcerns the effect of the healing group when it first establishes contact withthe one to be healed. This must not be forgotten. Sometimes, when the patient’skarma indicates it, the will-to-live must be restored to him; in other cases,the rejection of fear (fear of life or fear of death) must be induced, bringingwith it the restoration of courage; the restoration of an affirmative attitudein all circumstances may be the quality needed, bringing with it the restitutionof the willingness to take, with understanding and with joy, whatever the futuremay bring; it may also involve the restitution of harmonious relations with thepatient’s surroundings, with family and friends, and the consequent result ofrenewed correct adjustments, an uprising of a spirit of love and the negation ofwhat may have been deep-seated wrong thinking.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that the process of following a healingritual is only one phase of the work to be done, and that the relation of healerand patient is basically an educational one; it must be an education tempered bythe physical condition of the sick person. You will find, as you work alongthese lines, that it will be necessary to have short expositions of the work tobe done, of the restitutions which the patient must be prepared to make in orderto facilitate the inflow of the healing force. He must be induced to “clean theslate” (if I may use such a symbolic [389] phrase) if the work of healing is tobe successful under the Law of Karma.This phase of the preparatory work is not easy. With patients who may begrievously ill, it may not be possible. It will be found by all healing agenciesthat when working with those who are spiritually-minded and those whose liveshave for a long time been based upon right effort and a correct “rendering untoCaesar the things which are Caesar’s and unto God the things which are God’s,”that the work of healing will be greatly accelerated or, on the other hand, thatthe task of smoothing the way through the gates of death will be greatlysimplified. After all, death is in itself a work of restitution. It involves thework of rendering back of substance to the three worlds of substance, and doingit willingly and gladly; it involves also the restoration of the human soul tothe soul from whence it emanated, and doing this in the joy of reabsorption. Youmust all learn to look upon death as an act of restitution; when you can do thisit will take on new light and true meaning and become an integralpart—recognised and desired—of a constant living process.If I were asked to say what is the major task of all healing groups, such as theHierarchy seeks to see functioning in the future, I would say it is to preparehuman beings for what we should regard as the restorative aspect of death, andthus give to that hitherto dreaded enemy of mankind a new and happiersignificance. You will find that if you work along these indicated lines ofthought, the entire theme of death will constantly recur, and that the result ofthis will be new attitudes to dying and the inculcation of a happy expectancywhere that inevitable and most familiar event occurs. Healing groups mustprepare to deal with this basic condition of all living, and a major part oftheir work will be the elucidating of the principle of death. The [390] soul, weare told, must return to the one who gave it. To date that has been an enforcedand dreaded restitution, one which engenders fear and which leads men and womeneverywhere to clamour for the healing of the physical body, overemphasising itsimportance and making them regard the prolongation of earthly existence as themost important factor in their lives. During the next cycle, these wrongattitudes must come to an end; death will become a normal and understoodprocess—as normal as the process of birth, though evoking less pain and fear.This comment of mine is in the nature of a prophecy and should be noted as such.I would, therefore, enjoin upon you the elementary fact that any healing groupseeking to work along the new lines must (as a preliminary effort) seek tounderstand something about the factor of death to which is given the appellationof “the great restorative process” or “the great restitution.” It concerns theart of wisely, correctly and with due timing, giving back the body to the sourceof its constituent elements and of restoring the soul to the source of itsessential being. I am wording this with care because I seek to have you pondermost carefully and sanely upon the so-called enigma of death. It is an enigma toman, but not an enigma to disciples and knowers of the wisdom.Healing groups and individual healers will find it necessary at times toconfront their patients with the fact of death; one of the undertakings ofdisciples in my Ashram and in the Ashram of the Master K.H. is to interject thetheme of death into their conversation with other seekers for truth, into theirthinking and into their discussions with each other, and particularly with thosethey seek to heal. It will not be easy and it must not be done in a precipitatemanner, but it is a subject which cannot and must not be avoided or evaded.Healing groups working out from an Ashram lay not the emphasis upon bodilyhealing, but upon [391] timing and upon the cycles of work or of physical planeliving, and the cycles of restitution or physical plane death.This entire section with which we are now engaged, called The BasicRequirements, has reference in reality to the processes of dying, to theconditions of the material world or the three worlds of incarnated service. Therestitution of the body to the general reservoir of substance, or to service inthe outer world of daily physical living, the restoration of the soul to itssource, the soul upon its own plane or—in reverse—to full responsibility withinthe body, are dealt with in this first point. The elimination of the lifeprinciple and the consciousness aspect is dealt with in the second point, andthe theme is not that of character building, as some might surmise. I touchedupon character and personal qualities in my opening remarks in this sectionbecause all true understanding of the basic principles of death and life isfacilitated by right action, based on right thinking, which eventuates in rightcharacter building. I seek not, however, to enlarge upon these elementaryprerequisites. The processes of integration as I seek to consider them hereconcern the integration of the soul into the threefold body, if karma sodecides, or into the kingdom of souls, if karma decrees that what we call deathlies ahead of the man.We are therefore considering, in this second section, the problem of death orthe art of dying. This is something which all seriously ill people mustinevitably face, and for which those in good health should prepare themselvesthrough correct thinking and sane anticipation. The morbid attitude of themajority of men to the subject of death, and their refusal to consider it whenin good health, is something which must be altered and deliberately changed.Christ demonstrated to His disciples the correct attitude when referring to Hiscoming and immediate decease at the hand [392] of His enemies; He chided themwhen they evidenced sorrow, reminding them that He was going to His Father.Being an initiate of high degree, He meant that He was, occultly speaking,“making restitution to the Monad”; ordinary people and those below the grade ofan initiate of the third degree make “restitution to the soul.” The fear and themorbidness which the subject of death usually evokes, and the unwillingness toface it with understanding are due to the emphasis which people lay upon thefact of the physical body and the facility with which they identify themselveswith it; it is based also upon an innate fear of loneliness and the loss of thefamiliar. Yet the loneliness which eventuates after death, when the man findshimself without a physical vehicle, is as nothing compared to the loneliness ofbirth. At birth, the soul finds itself in new surroundings and immersed in abody which is at first totally incompetent to take care of itself or toestablish intelligent contact with surrounding conditions for a long period oftime. The man comes into incarnation with no recollection as to the identity orthe significance to him of the group of souls in bodies with which he findshimself in relationship; this loneliness only disappears gradually as he makeshis own personality contacts, discovers those who are congenial to him andeventually gathers around him those whom he calls his friends. After death thisis not so, for the man finds on the other side of the veil those whom the knowsand who have been connected with him in physical plane life, and he is neveralone as human beings understand loneliness; he is also conscious of those stillin physical bodies; he can see them; he can tune in on their emotions, and alsoupon their thinking, for the physical brain, being nonexistent, no longer actsas a deterrent. If people but knew more, birth would be the experience whichthey would dread, and not [393] death, for birth establishes the soul in thetrue prison, and physical death is only the first step towards liberation.Another fear which induces mankind to regard death as a calamity is one whichtheological religion has inculcated, particularly the Protestant fundamentalistsand the Roman Catholic Church—the-fear of hell, the imposition of penalties,usually out of all proportion to the errors of a lifetime, and the terrorsimposed by an angry God. To these man is told he will have to submit, and fromthem there is no escape, except through the vicarious atonement. There is, asyou well know, no angry God, no hell, and no vicarious atonement. There is onlya great principle of love animating the entire universe; there is the Presenceof the Christ, indicating to humanity the fact of the soul and that we are savedby the livingness of that soul, and the only hell is the earth itself, where welearn to work out our own salvation, actuated by the principle of love andlight, and incited thereto by the example of the Christ and the inner urge ofour own souls. This teaching anent hell is a remainder of the sadistic turnwhich was given to the thinking of the Christian Church in the Middle Ages andto the erroneous teaching to be found in the Old Testament anent Jehovah, thetribal God of the Jews. Jehovah is not God, the planetary Logos, the EternalHeart of Love Whom Christ revealed. As these erroneous ideas die out, theconcept of hell will fade from man’s recollection and its place will be taken byan understanding of salvation upon the physical plane, which leads him to rightthe wrongs which he may have perpetrated in his lives on Earth, and whichenables him eventually to “clean his own slate.”I seek not here to impose upon you a theological discussion. I seek only topoint out that the present fear of death must give place to an intelligentcomprehension of the reality [394] and to the substitution of a concept ofcontinuity which will negate disturbance, and emphasise the idea of the one lifeand one conscious Entity in many experiencing bodies.It might be stated, in order to sum up my general proposition, that the fear andhorror of death is founded upon the love of form—our own form, the forms ofthose we love and the form of our familiar surroundings and environment. Yetthis type of love runs counter to all our teaching anent the spiritualrealities. The hope of the future, and the hope of our release from thisill-founded fear, lie in the shifting of our emphasis to the fact of the eternalsoul and to the necessity for that soul to live spiritually, constructively anddivinely within the material vehicles. Into this concept again enters thethought of restitution. Wrong concepts are therefore forgotten; the idea ofelimination also enters in so that right focus is attained. Integration demandsconsideration, so that absorption in the life of the soul will take the place ofabsorption in the life of the body. Sorrow, loneliness, unhappiness, decay,loss—all these are ideas which must disappear as the common reaction to the factof death also vanishes. As men learn to live consciously as souls, as they alsolearn to focus themselves on soul levels and begin to regard the form or formsas simply modes of expression, all the old sorrowful ideas anent death willgradually disappear, and a new and more joyful approach to that great experiencewill take their place.You will note that the various words I have chosen in considering the basicrequirements have been so chosen for their specific meanings:1. The Work of Restitution signifies the returning of the form to the basicreservoir of substance; or of the soul, the divine spiritual energy, returningto its source—either on soul or monadic levels, according to the point [395] inevolution. This restitution is predominantly the work of the human soul withinthe physical body and involves both the heart and the head centres.2. The Art of Elimination . This refers to two activities of the inner spiritualman; i.e., the elimination of all control by the threefold lower man, and theprocess of refocussing itself upon the concrete levels of the mental plane as apoint of radiant light. This concerns primarily the human soul.3. The Processes of Integration. These deal with the work of the liberatedspiritual man as he blends with the soul (the oversoul) upon the higher levelsof the mental plane. The part returns to the whole, and the man comprehends thetrue meaning of the words of Krishna, “Having pervaded this whole universe witha fragment of myself, I remain.” He, too, the conscious experiencing fragmentwhich has pervaded the little universe of the form in the three worlds, stillremains. He knows himself to be a part of the whole.These three processes are Death.It will be obvious to you that when humanity attains this outlook upon the factof death or the art of dying, the entire attitude of the race of men willundergo beneficent change. This will be paralleled, as time elapses, by arapport between men upon telepathic levels; men will be steadily growing inintelligence, and humanity will be increasingly focussed upon mental levels.This telepathic rapport will be a common and ordinary phenomenon of which modernspiritualism is the guarantee, though the distortion (and a very seriousdistortion) is largely based on humanity’s wishful thinking, with very littletrue telepathy to be found in it. The telepathy which is present today betweenthe medium [396] (in or out of trance) and the bereaved relative or friend isnot between the one who has experienced the release of death and the one who isstill in form. This should be remembered. In the interim where mind is notnormally telepathic, there may be (though there very seldom is) theinterposition of a mediumship based upon clairvoyance and clairaudience, but notupon trance. This will still necessitate a contact via a third party, and willbe entirely astral; it will therefore be full of glamour and error. It will,however, be a step forward from the present mediumistic performances whichsimply ignore the man who is dead and give to the enquirer only what the mediumreads in his aura—his recollection of the personal appearance, significantremembrances stored in the enquirer’s consciousness, and wishful thinking anentadvice demanded because the enquirer believes that because a man is dead he mustbe more wise than heretofore. When the medium at times succeeds in establishingtrue communication, it is because the enquirer and the dead person are mentaltypes, and there is therefore a true telepathic rapport between them which themedium intercepts.The race is progressing, developing and becoming increasingly mental. Therelation between the dead and the living must and will be upon mental levels,prior to the processes of integration; the true severance of communication willcome when the human soul is reabsorbed into the oversoul, prior to againreincarnating. The fact of communication up to that time will, however,completely destroy the fear of death. In the case of disciples working in aMaster’s Ashram, even this process of integration will constitute no barrier. Inthe next few pages I will give some teaching on what might be called the art ofdying and so expand what I said in A Treatise on White Magic .PRESENT ATTITUDES TO DEATH[397] I undertook to take up with you the processes of dying and to consider alittle more fully the factor of death—the most familiar experience (could thephysical brain but recall it and realise it) in the life of the reincarnatingentity or soul. Let me make some comments as to the attitude of man to theexperience of “restitution.” This is a peculiarly occult word, largely used bythe initiate when speaking of death. The outstanding attitude associated withdeath is one of fear. This fear is based upon the—at present—mental uncertaintyas to the fact of immortality. Beyond the proven fact of some form of survival,established by the psychical research groups, immortality or the permanentexistence of what we usually mean when we speak of the “I” remains as yet in therealm of wishful thinking or of belief. This belief can be founded on Christianpremises, upon religious affirmation based on rationalising the matter, and onthe more scientific approach which argues that economic necessity requires thatthat which has been so long in evolving and which is the culminating result ofthe evolutionary process cannot be lost. It is interesting to note that there isno evidence upon our planet of any higher evolutionary product than that of thehuman kingdom; even for the materialistic thinker, the uniqueness of man is tobe found in his various stages of consciousness and in his capacity to presentfor investigation all stages of consciousness, from that of the illiteratesavage, through all the intermediate stages of mental effectiveness up to themost advanced thinkers and geniuses, capable of creative art, scientificdiscovery and spiritual perception. Putting it very simply, the question whichthe theme of death arouses is: Where is the “I,” the occupying tenant of thebody, when that body is relinquished and disintegrates? Is there, in the lastanalysis, an occupying tenant?[398] Human history records the endless search for assurance upon this subject;this search culminates today in the numerous societies which are occupyingthemselves with the attempt to prove immortality and to penetrate into thosefastnesses of the spirit which apparently give sanctuary to that “I” which hasbeen the actor on the physical plane and which has hitherto baffled the mostearnest seeker. The incentive of fear lies behind this frantic search; it is anunfortunate fact that the majority of the people (apart from a few enlightenedscientists and similar intelligent seekers) who engage in the usuallyquestionable techniques of the seance room, are emotional types, easilyconvinced and only too ready to accept as evidence that which the moreintelligent seeker would immediately repudiate.Let me here make my position clear as regards the great spiritualistic movementwhich has done so much in the past to prove the fact of survival, and which hasalso, in certain of its phases, done so much to mislead and deceive mankind.Under this general term, I class also the various psychical research groups andexempt all sincere scientific work. None of these groups has as yet proven theircase. The mystery and the foolishness of the average seance room, and the workof the mediums, have nevertheless demonstrated the presence of an inexplicablefactor; the laboratories of the scientific research worker have scarcely provedeven that. For every case of the definitely acceptable appearance of adiscarnate person there are thousands of cases which can be explained upon thegrounds of gullibility, telepathic rapport (with the bereaved person, but notwith anyone who has passed over), the seeing of thoughtforms by the clairvoyantand the hearing of voices by the clairaudient, and also by trickery. Note that Irefer to “acceptable appearances” of a returning spirit. There is enoughevidence to warrant belief in survival and to prove its factual nature. Upon thegrounds of the inexplicable phenomena [399] of contact with the supposedly deadwhich have been noted, investigated and proven, and upon the character of themen who testify to the fact of these phenomena, we can affirm that somethingsurvives the “restitution” of the material body to the eternal reservoir ofsubstance. It is on this premise that we proceed.Today the phenomenon of death is becoming increasingly familiar. The world warhas launched millions of men and women—civilians and those in the variousbranches of the armed forces of all the nations—into that unknown world whichreceives all those who discard the physical form. Conditions are at this timesuch that in spite of the ancient and deep-seated fear of death, there isemerging in the consciousness of mankind the realisation that there are manyworse things than death; men have come to know that starvation, mutilation,permanent physical incapacity, mental disability as the result of war and thestrain of war, the observation of pain and agony which cannot be relieved, areindeed worse than death; also, many know and believe (for such is the glory ofthe human spirit) that the relinquishing of the values for which men have foughtand died down the ages and which are deemed essential to the life of the freehuman spirit is of greater significance than the process of death. Thisattitude, characteristic of the sensitive and the right thinking people at thistime, is now emerging upon a large scale. This means the recognition, alongsideof the ancient fear, of an unconquerable hope of better conditions to be foundelsewhere, and this need not necessarily be wishful thinking but an indicationof a latent subjective knowledge, slowly coming to the surface. Something is onits way as a result of human distress and human thinking; this is today sensed;this fact will be later demonstrated. Opposing this inner confidence andsubjective realisation are old habits of thought, the developed materialisticattitude [400] of the present, the fear of deception, and the antagonism of boththe scientist and the religious man or churchman. The former rightly refuses tobelieve that which remains still unproven and seems also not to be susceptibleof proof, whilst religious groups and organisations have no confidence in anypresentation of truth which they have not formulated in their own terms. Thislays an undue emphasis upon belief and thus stultifies all enthusiasticinvestigation. The discovery of the fact of immortality will come from thepeople; it will eventually then be accepted by the churches and proven byscience, but this not until the aftermath of the war is over and this planetarydisturbance has subsided.The problem of death, needless to say, is founded upon the love of life which isthe deepest instinct in human nature. The determination that nothing is lostunder divine law is a recognition of science; eternal persistence in some formor another is universally held to be a truth. Out of the welter of theories,three major solutions have been proposed; these are well known to all thinkingpeople. They are:1. The strictly materialistic solution, which posits the experience andexpression of conscious life as long as the physical, tangible form exists andpersists, but also teaches that after death and the subsequent disintegration ofthe body there is no longer any conscious, functioning, self-identified person.The sense of the “I,” the awareness of a personality in contradistinction to allother personalities, vanishes with the disappearance of the form: personality isbelieved to be only the sumtotal of the consciousness of the cells in the body.This theory relegates man to the same state as any of the other forms in thethree other kingdoms in nature; [401] it is based on the nonsensitivity of theaverage human being to life, withdrawn from a tangible vehicle; it ignores allevidence to the contrary and says that because we cannot see (visually) andprove (tangibly) the persistence of the “I” or the immortal entity after death,it is nonexistent. This theory is not held by so many as it was in earlieryears, particularly during the materialistic Victorian age.2. The theory of conditional immortality . This theory is still held by certainfundamentalist and theologically narrow schools of thought and also by a few ofthe intelligentsia, primarily those of egoistic tendency. It posits that onlythose who reach a particular stage of spiritual awareness, or who accept apeculiar set of theological pronouncements, can receive the gift of personalimmortality. The highly intellectual also argue at times that the crowning giftto humanity is a developed and cultured mind, and that those who possess thisgift are likewise endowed with eternal persistence. One school dismisses thosewho are what they regard as spiritually recalcitrant or negative to theimposition of their particular theological certainties, either to completeannihilation as in the materialistic solution, or to a process of eternalpunishment, thus at the same time arguing for a form of immortality. Owing tothe innate kindness of the human heart, very few are vindictive or unthinkingenough to regard this presentation as acceptable, and of course among those wemust class the unthinking people who escape from mental responsibility intoblind belief in theological pronouncements. The Christian interpretation asgiven by the orthodox and the fundamentalist schools proves untenable whensubmitted to clear reasoning; among the arguments which negate its accuracy liesthe fact that [402] Christianity posits a long future but no past; it islikewise a future entirely dependent upon the activities of this present lifeepisode and accounts in no way for the distinctions and differences whichdistinguish humanity. It is only tenable upon the theory of an anthropomorphicDeity Whose will—as it works out in practice—gives a present that has no pastbut only a future; the injustice of this is widely recognised, but theinscrutable will of God must not be questioned. Millions still hold this belief,but it is not so strongly held as it was one hundred years ago.3. The theory of reincarnation , so familiar to all my readers, is becomingincreasingly popular in the Occident; it has always been accepted (though withmany foolish additions and interpretations) in the Orient. This teaching hasbeen as much distorted as have the teachings of the Christ or the Buddha or ShriKrishna by their narrow-minded and mentally limited theologians. The basic factsof a spiritual origin, of a descent into matter, of an ascent through the mediumof constant incarnations in form until those forms are perfect expressions ofthe indwelling spiritual consciousness, and of a series of initiations at theclose of the cycle of incarnation, are being more readily accepted andacknowledged than ever before.Such are the major solutions of the problems of immortality and of thepersistence of the human soul; they aim to answer the eternal questioning of thehuman heart as to Whence, Why, Whither and Where? Only the last of theseproposed solutions offers a truly rational reply to all of them. Its acceptancehas been delayed because, ever since the time of H. P. Blavatsky, who formulatedthis ancient truth for the modern world in the last quarter [403] of thenineteenth century, it has been so unintelligently presented; it has beenhandicapped owing to the fact that the Eastern races have always held it,and—from the Western angle—they are heathen and the heathen “in their blindnessbow down to wood and stone,” to quote one of your fundamentalist hymns. Howcurious it is to realise that, to the man from Eastern countries, the religiouspeople in the West do likewise, and can be seen on their knees before theChristian altars bearing statues of the Christ, of the Virgin Mary and of theApostles.The occultists of the world, through the theosophical societies and other occultbodies, so-called, have greatly damaged the presentation of the truth anentreincarnation through the unnecessary, unimportant, inaccurate and purelyspeculative details which they give out as truths anent the processes of deathand the circumstances of man after death. These details are largely dependentupon the clairvoyant vision of astral psychics of prominence in the TheosophicalSociety. Yet in the Scriptures of the world these details are not given, andH.P.B. in The Secret Doctrine gave none. An instance of this inaccurate andfoolish attempt to throw light upon the theory of rebirth can be seen in thetime limits imposed upon departed human souls between incarnations on thephysical plane and the return to physical rebirth—so many years of absence areproclaimed, dependent upon the age of the departed soul and its place upon theladder of evolution. If, we are told, the soul is very advanced, absence fromthe physical plane is prolonged, whereas the reverse is the case. Advanced soulsand those whose intellectual capacity is rapidly developing come back with greatrapidity, owing to their sensitive response to the pull of obligations,interests and responsibilities already established upon the physical plane.People are apt to forget that time is the sequence of events and of states of[404] consciousness as registered by the physical brain. Where no physical brainexists, what humanity understands by time is nonexistent. The removal of thebarriers of the form, stage by stage, brings an increasing realisation of theEternal Now. In the case of those who have passed through the door of death andwho still continue to think in terms of time, it is due to glamour and to thepersistence of a powerful thoughtform. It indicates polarisation upon the astralplane; this is the plane upon which leading Theosophical writers and psychicshave worked, and upon which they have based their writings. They are quitesincere in what they say, but omit to recognise the illusory nature of allfindings based on astral clairvoyance. The recognition of a pronounced timefactor, and the constant emphasis laid upon timing, are characteristic of allhighly developed people in incarnation and of those whose lower, concrete mindsare powerful in calibre. Children and child-races on the one hand, and thosehighly advanced people whose abstract minds are functioning (through the mediumof the interpretive lower mind), usually have no sense of time. The initiateuses the time factor in his relations and his dealings with those living uponthe physical plane, but is detached within himself from all recognition of itelsewhere in the universe.Therefore the use of the term “immortality” infers timelessness and teaches thatthis timelessness exists for that which is not perishable or conditioned bytime. This is a statement requiring careful consideration. Man reincarnatesunder no time urge. He incarnates under the demands of karmic liability, underthe pull of that which he, as a soul, has initiated, and because of a sensedneed to fulfill instituted obligations; he incarnates also from a sense ofresponsibility and to meet requirements which an earlier breaking of the lawsgoverning right human relations have [405] imposed upon him. When theserequirements, soul necessities, experiences and responsibilities have all beenmet, he enters permanently “into the clear cold light of love and life” and nolonger needs (as far as he himself is concerned the nursery stage of soulexperience on earth. He is free from karmic impositions in the three worlds, butis still under the impulse of karmic necessity which exacts from him the lastpossible ounce of service that he is in a position to render to those stillunder the Law of Karmic Liability. You have, therefore, three aspects of the Lawof Karma, as it affects the principle of rebirth:1. The Law of Karmic Liability , governing life in the three worlds of humanevolution, and which is ended altogether at the fourth initiation.2. The Law of Karmic Necessity. This governs the life of the advanced discipleand the initiate from the time of the second initiation until a certaininitiation higher than the fourth; these initiations enable him to pass on tothe Way of the Higher Evolution.3. The Law of Karmic Transformation , a mysterious phrase governing theprocesses undergone upon the Higher Way. These fit the initiate to pass off thecosmic physical plane altogether, and to function upon the cosmic mental plane.It is concerned with the release of those like Sanat Kumara, and His Associatesin the Council Chamber at Shamballa, from the imposition of cosmic desire whichdemonstrates upon our cosmic physical plane as spiritual will. This should be toyou an arresting thought. It will be obvious, however, that there is little thatI can say upon this subject. The knowledge involved is not yet mine.[406] To turn now to another aspect of our theme. There are, speaking in thelarger sense, three major death episodes.There is, first of all, the constant recurrence of the fact of physical death.This is familiar to all of us through its extreme frequency, could we butrealise it. This recognition would rapidly eliminate the present fear of death.There is then the “second death” spoken of in the Bible, which is in thispresent planetary cycle associated with the death of all astral control over thehuman being. In the larger sense, this second death is consummated at the fourthinitiation, when even spiritual aspiration dies, being no more needed; the Willof the initiate is now fixed and immovable, and astral sensitivity is no longerrequired.There is a curious counterpart to this experience upon a much lower level in thedeath of all astral emotion which takes place for the individual aspirant at thetime of the second initiation. It is then a complete episode and is consciouslyregistered. Between the second and the third initiations, the disciple has todemonstrate a continuity of nonresponse to astralism and emotionalism. Thesecond death, to which I am here referring, has to do with the death or thedisappearance of the causal body at the time of the fourth initiation; thismarks the completion of the building of the antahkarana and the institution ofdirect, unimpeded continuity of relationship between the Monad and thepersonality.The third death takes place when the initiate leaves behind him, finally andwith no prospect of return, all relation with the cosmic physical plane. Thisdeath, necessarily, lies far ahead for all in the Hierarchy and is at presentonly possible and permissible for a few in the Council Chamber at Shamballa. Itis not, however, a process through which Sanat Kumara will pass. He underwentthis “transformation” many aeons ago, during the great cataclysm [407] whichinaugurated the Lemurian Age, and which was induced by His cosmic experience andthe need for an inflow of energy from extra-planetary Beings.I have given these brief summations so as to enlarge your general understandingof what the Masters call “the extension of death in space.” Nevertheless, in thefollowing pages we shall confine ourselves to the theme of the death of thephysical body and of the subtler bodies in the three worlds; we shall deal alsowith the processes which bring about the reabsorption of the human soul into thespiritual soul upon its own plane, the higher mental plane; we shall considerthe reassimilation of substance and the appropriation of matter in order againto reincarnate.We shall therefore consider the three major processes to which I earlierreferred; these cover three periods and lead, eventually, to other processesunder the Law of Rebirth. They are:1. The Process of Restitution , governing the period of withdrawal of the soulfrom the physical plane and from its two phenomenal aspects, the dense physicalbody and the etheric body. This concerns the Art of Dying.2. The Process of Elimination . This governs that period of the life of thehuman soul after death and in the two other worlds of human evolution. Itconcerns the elimination of the astral-mental body by the soul, so that it is“ready to stand free in its own place.”3. The Process of Integration , dealing with the period wherein the liberatedsoul again becomes conscious of itself as the Angel of the Presence and isreabsorbed into the world of souls, thus entering into a state of reflection.Later, under the impact of [408] the Law of Karmic Liability or Necessity, thesoul again prepares itself for another descent into form.The field of experience (in which is death, as the average person knows it) isthe three worlds of human evolution—the physical world, the world of emotion anddesire, and the mental plane. This world is, in the last analysis twofold, fromthe angle of death, and hence the phrase “the second death.” This I have earlierapplied to the death or destruction of the causal body, in which the spiritualsoul has hitherto functioned. It can be applied, however, in a more literalsense, and may be referred to the second phase of the death process in the threeworlds. It then concerns form only, and is related to those vehicles ofexpression which are found below the formless levels of the cosmic physicalplane. These form levels are (as you know well, for the knowledge constitutesthe a.b.c. of the occult theory) the levels on which the concrete, lower mindfunctions, the emotional nature reacts to the so-called astral plane, and thedual physical plane. The physical body consists of the dense physical body andthe etheric vehicle. We have consequently, when considering the death of a humanbeing, to employ the word death in relation to two phases in which it functions:Phase One : The death of the physical-etheric body. This phase falls into twostages:a. That in which the atoms which constitute the physical body are restored tothe source from whence they came. This source is the sumtotal of the matter ofthe planet, constituting the dense physical body of the planetary Life.b. That in which the etheric vehicle, composed of an aggregation of forces,returns these forces to the [409] general reservoir of energy. This dual phasecovers the Process of Restitution.Phase Two : The “rejection” (as it is sometimes called) of the mental-emotionalvehicles. These form, in reality, only one body; to it the early theosophists(correctly) gave the name of the “kama-manasic body” or the vehicle ofdesire-mind. I have said elsewhere that there is no such thing as the astralplane or the astral body. Just as the physical body is made up of matter whichis not regarded as a principle, so the astral body—as far as the mind nature isconcerned—is in the same category. This is a difficult matter for you to graspbecause desire and emotion are so real and so devastatingly important.But—speaking literally—from the angle of the mental plane, the astral body is “afigment of the imagination”; it is not a principle. The massed use of theimagination in the service of desire has nevertheless constructed an illusoryglamorous world, the world of the astral plane. During physical incarnation, andwhen a man is not upon the Path of Discipleship, the astral plane is very real,with a vitality and a life all its own. After the first death (the death of thephysical body) it still remains equally real. But its potency slowly dies out:the mental man comes to realise his own true state of consciousness (whetherdeveloped or undeveloped), and the second death becomes possible and takesplace. This phase covers the Process of Elimination.When these two phases of the Art of Dying are over, the discarnate soul standsfree from the control of matter; it is purified (temporarily by the phases ofRestitution and Elimination) from all contamination by substance. This isachieved, not through any activity of the soul in form, [410] the human soul,but as a result of the activity of the soul on its own plane abstracting thefraction of itself which we call the human soul. It is primarily the work of theovershadowing soul which effects this; it is not carried forward by the soul inthe personality. The human soul, during this stage, is only responsive to thepull or the attractive force of the spiritual soul as it—with deliberateintent—extracts the human soul from its imprisoning sheaths. Later on, as theevolutionary processes proceed and the soul increasingly controls thepersonality, it will be the soul within the imprisoning sheaths which will bringabout—consciously and with intention—the phases of dying. In the earlier stages,this release will be brought about with the aid of the overshadowing spiritualsoul. Later on, when the man is living upon the physical plane as the soul, hewill himself—with full continuity of consciousness—carry out the processes ifabstraction, and will then (with directed purpose) “ascend to the place fromwhence he came.” This is the reflection in the three worlds of the divineascension of the perfected Son of God.Some of the information I have already given anent the subject of Death in myother writings might well be appended here. I have a definite purpose insuggesting this. Death is all around you at this time; the demand of the humanspirit for light upon this matter has reached a crisis of potency; it is evokingthe inevitable response from the Hierarchy. It is also my hope that studentswill do something of major importance to aid in bringing forth the light uponthe processes of death which humanity is today demanding.ON DEATH - EXCERPTS FROM OTHER WRITINGS“Why this blind power? Why Death? Why this decay [411] of forms? Why thenegation of the power to hold? Why death, O mighty Son of God?”Faintly the answer comes: “I hold the keys of life and deth. I bind and looseagain. I the Destroyer am.A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. I, Page 63.The intent of the Lord of the first Ray is to stand behind the other divineAspects, and when They have achieved Their purpose, to shatter the forms Theyhave built.He is the controller of the death drama in all kingdoms—a destruction of formswhich brings about release of power and permits “entrance into light through thegateway of death.”Page 64.a. “Withhold thy hand until the time has come. Then give the gift of death, OOpener of the Door.”Page 65.b. “Separate the robe from That which hides behind its many folds. Take off theveiling sheaths. Let God be seen. Take Christ from off the Cross.”Page 69.The first step towards substantiating the fact of the soul is to establish thefact of survival, though this may not necessarily prove the fact ofimmortality....That something survives the process of death, and that somethingpersists after the disintegration of the physical body is steadily being proved.If that is not so, then we are the victims of a collective hallucination, andthe brains and minds of thousands of people are untrue and deceiving, arediseased and distorted. Such a gigantic collective insanity is more difficult tocredit than the alternative of an expanded consciousness.Page 98-99.[412] a. The growth of etheric vision and the largely increased numbers ofclairaudient and clairvoyant people is steadily revealing the existence of theastral plane and the etheric counterpart of the physical world. More and morepeople are becoming aware of this subjective realm: they see people walkingaround who are either the so-called “dead” or who, in sleep, have dropped thephysical sheath.Page 98.b. The next two hundred years will see the abolition of death, as we nowunderstand that great transition, and the establishing of the soul’s existence.The soul will be known as an entity, as the motivating impulse and the spiritualcentre back of all manifested forms. . . Our essential immortality will bedemonstrated and realised to be a fact in nature.Page 96.Within the next few years the fact of persistence and of the eternity ofexistence will have advanced out of the realm of questioning into the realm ofcertainty....There will be no question in anyone’s mind that the discarding ofthe physical body will leave a man still a conscious living entity. He will beknown to be perpetuating his existence in a realm lying behind the physical. Hewill be known to be still alive, awake and aware. This will be brought about by:a. The development of a power within the physical eye of a human being. . . willreveal the etheric body. . . men will be seen occupying that body.b. The growth of the number of people who have the power to use the “reawakenedthird eye” will demonstrate immortality, for they will with facility see the[413] man who has discarded his etheric body as well as his physical body.c. A discovery in the field of photography will prove survival.d. Through the use of the radio by those who have passed over will communicationeventually be set up and reduced to a true science.e. Man will eventually be keyed up to a perception and to a contact which willenable him to see through, which will reveal the nature of the fourth dimension,and will blend the subjective and objective worlds together into a new world.Death will lose its terrors and that particular fear will come to an end.Page 183.You must always bear in mind that the consciousness remains the same whether inphysical incarnation or out of incarnation, and that development can be carriedon with even greater ease than when limited and conditioned by the brainconsciousness.Discipleship in the New Age, Vol. I, Page 81.The Law of Sacrifice and Death is the controlling factor on the physical plane.The destruction of the form, in order that the evolving life may progress, isone of the fundamental methods in evolution.A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, Page 569.a. The Law of Disintegration is an aspect of the Law of Death. This is the lawthat governs the destruction of the form in order that the indwelling life mayshine forth in fullness....This law breaks up the forms and the Law ofAttraction draws back to primal sources the material of those forms.Page 580.[414] b. The Law of Death controls in the three worlds.Page 596.c. The Law of Sacrifice is the Law of Death in the subtle bodies, whilst what wecall death is the analogous thing in the physical body.Page 596.d. The Law of Death and Sacrifice governs the gradual disintegration of concreteforms and their sacrifice to the evolving life....Page 596.e. When all the units or cells in the body of the planetary Logos have achieved,He too is set free from dense manifestation and physically dies.Page 509.The process of DEATH is occultly as follows:a. The first stage is the withdrawal of the life force in the etheric vehiclefrom the dense physical body and the consequent “falling into corruption” andbecoming “scattered to the elements.” Objective man fades out and is no moreseen by the physical eye, though still in his etheric body. When etheric visionis developed, the thought of death will assume very different proportions. Whena man can be seen functioning in his etheric physical body by a majority of therace, the dropping of the dense body will be considered just as a release.b. The second stage is the withdrawal of the life force from the etheric body,and its devitalisation....c. The third stage is the withdrawal of the life force from the astral oremotional form so that it disintegrates in a similar manner and the life iscentralised elsewhere. It has gained an increase of vitality [415] throughphysical plane existence and added colour through emotional experience.d. The final stage for the human being is its withdrawal from the mentalvehicle. The life forces after this fourfold abstraction are centralisedentirely in the soul....Pages 735-7.The Law of Attraction breaks up the forms and draws back to primal sources thematerial of those forms, prior to rebuilding them anew. On the path of evolutionthe effects of this law are well-known, not only in the destruction of discardedvehicles, but in the breaking up of the forms in which great ideals areembodied....All eventually break under the working of this law.Its workings are more apparent to the average human mind in its manifestationsat this time on the physical plane. We can trace the connection between theatmic (spiritual) and the physical plane—demonstrating on the lower plane as theLaw of Sacrifice and Death—but its effect can be seen on all five planes aswell. It is the law which destroys the final sheath that separates the perfectedsoul.Page 581.When the “will to live” vanishes, then the “Sons of Necessity” cease fromobjective manifestation....When the Thinker on his own plane withdraws hisattention from his little system within the three worlds and gathers withinhimself all his forces, then physical plane existence comes to an end and allreturns within the causal consciousness....This demonstrates on the physicalplane in the withdrawing from out of the top of the head of the radiant ethericbody and the consequent disintegration of the [416] physical. The framework goesand the dense physical form falls apart.Page 85.a. The etheric body is in reality a network of fine channels which are thecomponent parts of one interlacing fine cord—one portion of this cord being themagnetic link which unites the physical and the astral bodies and which issnapped or broken after the withdrawal of the etheric body from the densephysical body at the time of death. (See Ecc: XII.6.)Page 98.b. Later “definite methods of demonstrating the fact that life persists afterthe death of the physical body will be followed and the etheric web will berecognised as a factor in the case.”Page 429.Death is “initiation, or the entering into a state of liberation.”A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. I, Page 197.Death and the Etheric Body.It is not our purpose to give facts for verification by science, or even topoint the way to the next step onward for scientific investigators; that we maydo so is but incidental and purely secondary. What we seek mainly is to giveindications of the development and correspondence of the threefold whole thatmakes the solar system what it is—the vehicle through which a great cosmicENTITY, the solar Logos, manifests active intelligence with the purpose in viewof demonstrating perfectly the love side of His nature. Back of this design liesa yet more esoteric and ulterior purpose, hid in the Will Consciousness of the[417] Supreme Being, which perforce will be later demonstrated when the presentobjective is attained. The dual alternation of objective manifestation and ofsubjective obscuration, the periodic out-breathing, followed by the in-breathingof all that has been carried forward through evolution, embodies in the systemone of the basic cosmic vibrations, and the keynote of that cosmic ENTITY whosebody we are. The heart beats of the Logos (if it might be so inadequatelyexpressed) are the source of all cyclic evolution, and hence the importanceattached to that aspect of development called the “heart” or “love aspect,” andthe interest that is awakened by the study of rhythm. This is true, not onlycosmically and macrocosmically, but likewise in the study of the human unit.Underlying all the physical sense attached to rhythm, vibration, cycles andheart-beat, lie their subjective analogies—love, feeling, emotion, desire,harmony, synthesis and ordered sequence—and back of these analogies lies thesource of all, the identity of that Supreme Being Who thus expresses Himself.Therefore the study of pralaya, or the withdrawal of the life from out of theetheric vehicle, will be the same whether one studies the withdrawal of thehuman etheric double, the withdrawal of the planetary etheric double, or thewithdrawal of the etheric double of the solar system. The effect is the same andthe consequences similar.What is the result of this withdrawal, or rather, what causes that somethingwhich we call death or pralaya? As we are strictly pursuing the text book stylein this treatise, we will continue our method of tabulation. The withdrawal ofthe etheric double of a man, a planet, and a system is brought about by thefollowing causes:a. The cessation of desire. This should be the result of all evolutionaryprocess. True death, under the law, is [418] brought about by the attainment ofthe objective, and hence by the cessation of aspiration. This, as the perfectedcycle draws to its close, will be true of the individual human being, of theHeavenly Man, and of the Logos Himself.b. By the slowing down and gradual cessation of the cyclic rhythm, the adequatevibration is achieved and the work accomplished. When the vibration or note isperfectly felt or sounded, it causes (at the point of synthesis with othervibrations) the utter shattering of the forms.Motion is characterised, as we know, by three qualities:1. Inertia2. Mobility3. RhythmThese three are experienced in just the above sequence and presuppose a periodof slow activity, succeeded by one of extreme movement. This middle periodproduces incidentally (as the true note and rate are sought) cycles of chaos, ofexperiment, of experience and of comprehension. Following on these two degreesof motion (which are characteristic of the atom, Man, of the Heavenly Man orgroup, and of the Logos or the Totality) comes a period of rhythm andstabilisation wherein the point of balance is achieved. By the force ofbalancing the pairs of opposites, and thus producing equilibrium, pralaya is theinevitable sequence.c. By the severing of the physical from the subtler body on the inner planes,through the shattering of the web. This has a threefold effect:First. The life that had animated the physical form (both dense and etheric) andwhich had its starting point in the permanent atom, and from thence “pervadedthe moving and the unmoving” (in God, the Heavenly Man, and the human being, aswell as in the atom of matter), is [419] withdrawn entirely within the atom uponthe plane of abstraction. This “plane of abstraction” is a different one for theentities involved:a. For the physical permanent atom, it is the atomic level.b. For man, it is the causal vehicle.c. For the Heavenly Man, it is the second plane of monadic life, His habitat.d. For the Logos, it is the plane of Adi.All these mark the points for the disappearance of the unit into pralaya. Weneed here to remember that it is always pralaya when viewed from below . Fromthe higher vision, that sees the subtler continuously overshadowing the densewhen not in objective manifestation, pralaya is simply subjectivity, and is notthat “which is not,” but simply that which is esoteric.Second. The etheric double of a man, a planetary Logos, and a solar Logos, beingshattered, becomes nonpolarised as regards its indweller, and permits thereforeof escape. It is (to word it otherwise) no longer a source of attraction, nor afactual magnetic point. It becomes nonmagnetic, and the great Law of Attractionceases to control it; hence disintegration is the ensuing condition of the form.The Ego ceases to be attracted by its form on the physical plane, and proceedingto inbreathe, withdraws its life from out of the sheath. The cycle draws to aclose, the experiment has been made, the objective (a relative one from life tolife and from incarnation to incarnation) has been achieved, and. there remainsnothing more to desire: the Ego, or the thinking entity, loses interest,therefore, in form, and turns his attention inward. His polarisation changes,and the physical is eventually dropped.[420] The planetary Logos likewise in His greater cycle (the synthesis or theaggregate of the tiny cycles of the cells of His body) pursues the same course;He ceases to be attracted downward or outward, and turns His gaze within; Hegathers inward the aggregate of the smaller lives within His body, the planet,and severs connection. Outer attraction ceases, and all gravitates towards thecentre instead of scattering to the periphery of His body.In the system the same process is followed by the solar Logos; from His highplace of abstraction, He ceases to be attracted by His body of manifestation. Hewithdraws His interest and the pairs of opposites, the spirit and the matter ofthe vehicle, dissociate. With this dissociation the solar system, that “Son ofNecessity,” or of desire, ceases to be, and passes out of objective existence.Third . This leads finally, to the scattering of the atoms of the etheric bodyinto their primordial condition. The subjective life, the synthesis of will andlove taking active form, is withdrawn. The partnership is dissolved. The formthen breaks up; the magnetism that has held it in coherent shape is no longerpresent, and dissipation is complete. Matter persists, but the form no longerpersists.The work of the second Logos ends, and the divine incarnation of the Son isconcluded. But the faculty or inherent quality of matter also persists, and atthe end of each period of manifestation, matter (though distributed again intoits primal form) is active intelligent matter plus the gain of objectivity, andthe increased radiatory and latent activity which it has gained throughexperience. Let us illustrate: The matter of the solar system, whenundifferentiated, was active intelligent matter, and that is all that can bepredicated of it. This active intelligent matter was matter qualified by anearlier experience, and coloured by an earlier [421] incarnation. Now thismatter is in form, the solar system is not in pralaya but in objectivity—thisobjectivity having in view the addition of another quality to the logoiccontent, that of love and wisdom. Therefore, at the next solar pralaya, at theclose of the one hundred years of Brahma, the matter of the solar system will becoloured by active intelligence and by active love. This means literally thatthe aggregate of solar atomic matter will eventually vibrate to another key thanit did at the first dawn of manifestation.We can work this out in connection with the planetary Logos and the human unit,for the analogy holds good. We have a correspondence on a tiny scale in the factthat each human life period sees a man taking a more evolved physical body of agreater responsiveness, tuned to a higher key, of more adequate refinement, andvibrating to a different measure. In these three thoughts lies much information,if they are carefully studied and logically extended.d. By the transmutation of the violet into the blue. This we cannot enlarge on.We simply make the statement, and leave its working out to those students whosekarma permits and whose intuition suffices.e. By the withdrawal of the life, the form should gradually dissipate . Thereflex action here is interesting to note, for the greater Builders and Devaswho are the active agents during manifestation, and who hold the form incoherent shape, transmuting, applying and circulating the pranic emanations,likewise lose their attraction to the matter of the form, and turn theirattention elsewhere. On the path of out-breathing (whether human, planetary orlogoic) these building devas (on the same Ray as the unit desiringmanifestation, or on a complementary Ray) are attracted by his will and desire,and perform their office of construction. On the path of in-breathing (whetherhuman, planetary [422] or logoic) they are no longer attracted, and the formbegins to dissipate. They withdraw their interest, and the forces (likewiseentities) who are the agents of destruction. carry on their necessary work ofbreaking up the form; they scatter it—as it is occultly expressed—to “the fourwinds of Heaven,” or to the regions of the four breaths—a fourfold separationand distribution. A hint is here given for careful consideration.Though no pictures have been drawn of death bed scenes nor of the dramaticescape of the palpitating etheric body from the centre in the head, as mighthave been anticipated, yet some of the rules and purposes governing thiswithdrawal have been mentioned. We have seen how the aim of each life (whetherhuman, planetary or logoic) should be the effecting and the carrying out of adefinite purpose. This purpose is the development of a more adequate form forthe use of spirit; and when this purpose is achieved, then the indweller turnshis attention away, and the form disintegrates, having served his need. This isnot always the case in every human life, nor even in each planetary cycle. Themystery of the moon is the mystery of failure. This leads, when comprehended, toa life of dignity and offers an aim worthy of our best endeavour. When thisangle of truth is universally recognised, as it will be when the intelligence ofthe race suffices, then evolution will proceed with certainty, and the failuresbe less numerous.A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, Pages 128-133.All severing of links produces severe reactions. Yet if you could but realiseit, the severing of the outer physical plane links is the least severe and themost impermanent of all such events. Death itself is a part of the greatillusion and only exists because of the veils which we have gathered aroundourselves. All of us, as workers in the field of [423] glamour (the new field inwhich humanity must learn consciously to work), have been honoured and trusted.Death comes to all, but for disciples there should be none of the usual glamourand distress. I would say to you, look not back at the past. In that directionlie glamour and distress. It is the usual direction and the line of leastresistance for the majority. But such is not the way for you. Look not either torevelation or to the imparted illusory comfort of those who hover on thedividing line between the seen and the unseen. Again, that is not the way foryou. You are not a distressed and bereaved disciple looking anxiously at theseparating veil and hoping for some sign to come through which will convince youthat all is well....Reach up to the heights of the soul, and having sought and found that pinnacleof peace and that altitude of joy whereon your soul immovably stands, then lookinto the world of living men—a threefold world in which all men—incarnate anddiscarnate—are to be found. Find there that which your soul can and willrecognize. The glamours of one’s own distress, the maya of the past, distortever one’s point of view. Only the soul stands clear from illusion, and only thesoul sees things as they are. Mount, therefore, to the soul.Discipleship in the New Age, Vol. I, page 463."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V - THE PROCESS OF RESTITUTION[424] The theme of Death, which we are now considering, must be approached by uswith as much of the spirit of normalcy and of scientific investigation as we canmanage. The fear complex of humanity finds its point of entrance into man’sconsciousness through the act of dying; failure to survive is the basic fear;and yet it is the commonest phenomenon upon the planet. Bear that in mind. Theact of dying is the great universal ritual which governs our entire planetarylife, but only in the human family and faintly, very faintly, in the animalkingdom is the reaction to fear found. Could you but see the etheric world asThose on the inner side of life experience and see it, you would see (going onceaselessly and without any pause) the great planetary act of restitution. Youwould see a great activity proceeding within the etheric world in which theanima mundi, the animal soul and the human soul are constantly restoring thesubstance of all physical forms to the great reservoir of essential substance.This essential substance is as much a vital, directed unity as the world soul ofwhich one hears so much. This interplay of the principle of death with theprinciple of life produces the basic activity of creation. The impulsive,directive force is the mind of God, of the planetary Logos, as He pursues Hisdivine purposes, carrying [425] with Him in this process all the media throughwhich He manifests.The human fear of death is primarily caused because the orientation of thekingdom of souls, the fifth kingdom in nature, has been (until relatively latein the world’s cycle) towards form expression and towards the necessity ofseeking experience through matter, in order eventually freely to control it. Thepercentage of the souls of those who are oriented away from expression in thethree worlds is relatively so small, in proportion to the total number of soulsdemanding experience in the three worlds, that, until the cycle or era which wecall the Christian, it might be stated that death reigned triumphant. Today,however, we are on the eve of seeing a complete change in this condition, owingto the fact that humanity—on a much larger scale than ever known before—isachieving a needed reorientation; the higher values and the life of the soul, asentered upon through the insistence of the mind in its higher and lower aspects,is beginning to control. This will perforce bring in a new attitude towardsdeath; it will be regarded as a natural and desirable process, cyclicallyundergone. Men will eventually understand the significance of Christ’s wordswhen He said, “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God thethings that are God’s.” In the incident where those words occur He was referringto the great act of restitution which we call death. Ponder that story and seethe symbolism of the soul, contained within the universal soul, as the fishwithin the water, and holding a coin of metal, the symbol of matter.In one of the ancient writings the following symbolic words occur—Said the Father to the son : Go forth and take unto thyself that which is notthyself, and that which [426] is not thine own, but which is Mine. Regard it asthine own and seek the cause of its appearance. Let it appear to be thyself.Discover thus the world of glamour, the world of deep illusion, the world offalsity. Then learn that thou hast taken that which is not the goal of soulendeavour.And when that moment comes in each cycle and appearance of deception and oftheft, a voice will then be heard. Obey that voice. It is the voice of thatwithin thyself which hears My voice—a voice unheard by those who love to thieve.The order will go forth again and yet again: “Make restitution of the stolengoods. Learn they are not for thee.” At greater intervals will come that voiceagain: “Make restitution of the borrowed goods; pay back thy debt.”And then, when all the lessons have been learnt, the voice once more will speak:“Restore with joy that which was Mine, was thine and now again is ours. Thouhast no longer need of form. Stand free.”The implication of the above words is clear.Two major thoughts will serve to clarify the issue of death with which we arenow concerned: First, the great dualism ever present in manifestation. Each ofthe dualities has its own expression, is governed by its own laws, and seeks itsown objectives. But—in time and space—they merge their interests for the benefitof both, and together produce the appearance of a unity. Spirit-matter,life-appearance, energy-force—each have their own emanating aspect; they eachhave a relation to each other; each have a mutual temporary objective, and thusin unison produce the eternal flux, the cyclic ebb and flow of life inmanifestation. [427] In this process of relationship between Father-Spirit andMother-Matter the son comes into being, and during the child stage carries onhis life processes within the aura of the mother, identified with her yetforever seeking to escape from her domination. As maturity is reached, theproblem intensifies, and the “pull” of the Father begins slowly to offset thepossessive attitude of the mother, until finally the hold of matter, or of themother, over her son (the soul) is finally broken. The son, the Christ-child,released from the guardianship and clinging hands of the mother, comes to knowthe Father. I am talking to you in symbols.Second: All the processes of incarnation, of life in form and of restitution (bythe activity of the principle of death), of matter to matter, and soul to soul,are carried forward under the great universal Law of Attraction. Can you picturethe time when the process of death, clearly recognised and welcomed by the man,could be described by him in the simple phrase, “The time has come when mysoul’s attractive force requires that I relinquish and restore my body to theplace from whence it came”? Imagine the change in the human consciousness whendeath comes to be regarded as an act of simple and conscious relinquishing ofform, temporarily taken for two specific objectives:a. To gain control in the three worlds.b. To give opportunity to the substance of the forms thus “stolen or borrowed orrightly appropriated,” according to the stage of evolution, to reach a higherpoint of perfection through the impact upon it of life, via the soul.These are significant thoughts. They have been expressed before, but have beendiscarded as symbolic, as comforting or as wishful thinking. I present them toyou as factual in nature, as unavoidable in practice, and as familiar atechnique [428] and process as those activities, (rhythmic and cyclic in nature)which govern the average man’s life—rising and retiring, eating and drinking,and all the periodic affairs which he is accustomed to pursue.I dealt with the subject of death in A Treatise on White Magic , focussingtherein primarily upon the physical processes of dying and doing so from thepoint of view of the onlooker or observer. I sought there to indicate what theattitude of the onlooker should be. Here I would like to present a somewhatdifferent picture, indicating what is known by the departing soul. If thisinvolves repetition of what you already know, there are however certain basicrepetitions and statements I wish to make. Let me tabulate them with brevity.Will you regard them as foundational and factual.1. The time for the departure of an incarnating soul has come. The soul has inthe past:a. Appropriated a physical body of a certain calibre, adequate to therequirements and age of that soul.b. Energized that physical body through the medium of the etheric body, thusgalvanising it into life activity for the duration of the soul’s set term ofphysical enterprise.2. Two major streams of energy enter the physical body and produce its activity,its quality and type of expression, plus the impression it makes upon itsenvironment.a. The stream of dynamic life . This is anchored in the heart. This stream ofdynamic energy enters the body, via the head, and passes down to the heart,where it is focussed during the life cycle. A smaller stream of the universalenergy or prana, distinctive from the individualised life force, enters thephysical body, via the spleen. It then rises to the heart to [429] join thelarger and more important life stream. The life stream energises and holds incoherency the integrated physical body. The stream of pranic energy vitalisesthe individual atoms and cells of which that body is composed.b. The stream of individual consciousness . This is anchored in the head, is anaspect of the soul, reveals the type of consciousness which is, in its turn,indicative of the point attained in evolution. This stream of energy likewisefunctions in connection with a stream of personality force; and this force ischaracterised by desire (emotional or astral sentiency) and enters into thephysical body, via the solar plexus centre. This relates the man to the entireastral plane, and therefore to the world of glamour. With undeveloped people andwith the average type of man, the solar plexus is the focus of consciousness andthe energy is registered by the focal point of consciousness in the head withoutany recognition whatsoever. It is for this reason that (at the time of death)the soul leaves the body, via the solar plexus and not via the head. In the caseof the developed man, the mental type of individual, the aspirant, disciple orinitiate, the thread of consciousness will withdraw from the body via the head.3. The group soul of all forms in the animal kingdom—under the Law ofAttraction—withdraws the life principle from any specific physical form via thesolar plexus, which is the brain of the average animal. Highly developed anddomesticated animals are beginning to utilise the brain to a greater or to aless degree, but the life principle and the sentient aspect, or animalconsciousness, is still withdrawn via the solar plexus. You have, [430]therefore, in all stages of the evolutionary process, certain interestingtriangles of energy.a. In the case of the animals and of those human beings who are little more thananimals, of imbeciles and certain men who appear to be born with no centralisedpoint of individual consciousness, the following triplicity is of importance:The group soulThe solar plexusThe spleen or pranic centre.b. In low grade, but nevertheless individualised human beings and with theaverage emotional type of person, the following triplicity must be noted:The soulThe head centreThe solar plexus.c. For highly developed people and for those upon the Path of Discipleship youhave the following triangle active at the time of death:The soulThe head centreThe ajna centre.In connection with all these triplicities there exists a dual relationship tothe life principle:a. The heart in which is focussed the life of the soul in form.b. The spleen through which passes constantly and rhythmically the universallife essence or prana.The whole subject is of course most obscure, and for those on strictly humanlevels, as yet unverifiable. However, an acceptance of the above three points,hypothetical today, [431] will help to clarify your minds concerning this entiretheme of restitution with which we are occupied.4. The next point needs no proving, for it is generally accepted. It is thatdesire governs the process of death, as it also governs the processes of lifeexperience. We say constantly that when the will-to-live is lacking, death isthe inevitable result. This will-to-live, whether it is the tenacity of thephysical body, functioning as an elemental being or as the directed intention ofthe soul, is an aspect of desire, or rather, it is a reaction of the spiritualwill upon the physical plane. There is therefore an interlocking relationbetween:a. The soul on its own plane.b. The astral body.c. The solar plexus centre.This relationship has hitherto received little attention in connection with theArt of Dying. Nevertheless it warrants careful thought.You will note that I am here dealing with the theme of death as it makes itspresence felt through disease or through old age. I am not referring to death asit comes through war or accident, through murder or through suicide. Thesecauses of death, and other causes, come under a totally different directiveprocess: they may not even involve the karma of a man or his individual destiny,as in the case of war. Then vast numbers of people are killed. This has nothingto do with the Law of Cause and Effect as a factor in the soul career of anyindividual. It is not an act of restitution, planned by a particular soul as itworks out its individual destiny. Death, through the destructive processes ofwar, is under the directive and cyclic intention of the planetary Logos, workingthrough the Council Chamber at Shamballa. The Beings Who there direct worldprocesses [432] know that a time has come when the relation between planetaryevil and the Forces of Light or of Good have reached a point of “explosiveantagonism” (as it is called). This must be given free rein if the divinepurpose is to work out unarrested. The explosion is therefore permitted;nevertheless, all the time a controlling factor is present, even thoughunrealised by man. Because these Beings (Who work out the will of God) are in noway identified with form life, they have consequently a just appreciation of therelative importance of life in form; the destruction of forms is, to Them, notdeath in the sense that we understand it, but simply and solely a process ofliberation. It is the limited vision of those identified with form which has soconsistently nurtured the fear of death. The cycle in which we now live has seenthe greatest destruction of human forms in the entire history of our planet.There has been no destruction of human beings. I would have you note thisstatement. Because of this wholesale destruction, humanity has made a very rapidadvance towards a more serene attitude in connection with death. This is not yetapparent but—in a few years’ time—the new attitude will begin to be marked andthe fear of death will begin to die out in the world. This will also be largelydue to the increased sensitivity of the human response apparatus, leading to aturning inward or to a new orientation of the human mind, with unpredictableresults.The basis of all wars is fundamentally the sense of separateness. Thisfundamental individualism or pleased recognition of isolationism leads to allthe secondary causes of war: greed, producing economic disaster; hatred,producing national and international friction; cruelty, producing pain anddeath. The roots of death are therefore deep-seated; it is the destruction ofthe cycle of separateness as an individual upon the physical plane which we calldeath [433] in the usual sense; consequently death is a process of at-one-ment.Could you but see a little further into the matter, you would learn that deathreleases the individualised life into a less cramped and confined existence, andeventually—when the death process has been applied to all the three vehicles inthe three worlds—into the life of universality. This is a point of inexpressiblebliss.The Law of Attraction governs the process of dying, as it governs all else inmanifestation. It is the principle of coherency which, under the balancedintegration of the whole body, preserves it intact, stabilises its rhythm andcyclic life processes and relates its varied parts to each other. It is themajor coordinating principle within all forms, for it is the primary expression(within the soul) of the first aspect of divinity, the will aspect. Thisstatement may surprise you, accustomed as you are to regard the Law ofAttraction as an expression of the second aspect, love-wisdom. This attractiveprinciple is found in all forms, from the tiny form of the atom to that form,the planet Earth, through which our planetary Logos expresses Himself. But if itis the principle of coherency and the cause of integration, it is also themedium through which “restitution” is brought about and by which the human soulis periodically reabsorbed into the overshadowing soul. This aspect of the Lawof Attraction has, as yet, received little attention. The reason is that itconcerns the highest expression of that Law, and is therefore related to thewill aspect of Deity, as also the will aspect of the Monad. Only as theShamballic force proceeds with its more direct work in the coming cycle, and menbegin to discriminate (as they must and will) between self-will and thespiritual will, between determination, intention, plan, purpose, and fixedpolarisation, will clarification come. The Law of Attraction has (as all else inmanifestation) [434] three phases or aspects, each related to the three divineaspects:1. It relates life and form, spirit and matter—the third aspect.2. It governs the coherent integrative process which produces forms—the secondaspect.3. It brings about the imbalance which results in the act of disintegration,thus overcoming form—as far as the human being is concerned—and brings thisabout in three phases to which we have given the names:a. Restitution, resulting in the dissolution of the body and the return of itselements, atoms and cells, to their originating source.b. Elimination , involving the same basic process in relation to the forceswhich have constituted the astral body and the mental vehicle.c. Absorption , the mode whereby the human soul is integrated into itsoriginating source, the overshadowing, universal soul. This is an expression ofthe first aspect.All these phases, rightly understood, illustrate or demonstrate the uniquepotency of the Law of Attraction and its relation to the Law of Synthesis, whichgoverns the first divine aspect. Integration eventually produces synthesis. Themany cyclic integrations which are carried forward in the great life cycle of anincarnating soul lead to the final synthesis of spirit and soul, which is thegoal of the evolutionary process where humanity is concerned. After the thirdinitiation, this results in the complete liberation of the man from the “pull”of substance in the three worlds and in his consequent ability to wield, withfull understanding, the Law of Attraction in its various phases, as far as [435]the creative process is involved. Other phases will then be later mastered.One point must be borne in mind. The words “earth to earth and dust to dust,” sofamiliar in the burial rituals of the Occident, refer to this act of restitutionand connote the return of the physical body elements to the original reservoirof matter, and of the substance of the vital form to the general ethericreservoir; the words “the spirit shall return unto God who gave it” are adistorted reference to the absorption of the soul by the universal soul. Theordinary rituals, however, fail to emphasise that it is that individualisedsoul, in process of reabsorption, which institutes and orders, by an act of thespiritual will, that restitution. It is forgotten in the West that this “orderto restore” has been given with great frequency down the ages by every soulwithin a physical form; in so doing, steadily and inevitably, the first divineaspect—the Monad on its own plane—is tightening its hold upon its body ofmanifestation, via its reflection, the soul. Thus the will aspect comesincreasingly into play until, upon the Path of Discipleship, spiritualdetermination is brought to its highest point of development and, upon the Pathof Initiation, the will begins to function consciously. It is worth remembering,is it not, that it is in the deliberate issuing of the command by the soul uponits own plane to its shadow in the three worlds that the soul learns to expressthe first and highest aspect of divinity, and this at first, and for a very longtime, solely through the process of death. The difficulty at present is thatrelatively few people are soul-conscious, and consequently most men remainunaware of the “occult commands” of their own souls. As humanity becomessoul-conscious (and this will be one of the results of the agony of the presentwar), death will be seen as an “ordered” process, carried out in fullconsciousness and with understanding of [436] cyclic purpose. This willnaturally end the fear at present rampant, and will also arrest the tendency tosuicide, evidenced increasingly in these difficult times. The sin of murder isin reality based upon the fact that it interferes with soul-purpose, and notreally upon the killing of a particular human physical body. That is also whywar is not murder, as many well-meaning fanatics consider it; it is thedestruction of forms with the beneficent intent (if one could scrutinise divinepurpose) of the planetary Logos. However, it is the motives of the originatorsof war on the physical plane which make them evil. If war did not take place,the planetary life would, through what we call “acts of God,” call back thesouls of men on a large scale in line with His loving intention. When evil menprecipitate a war, He brings good out of evil.You can see, therefore, why the occult sciences lay the emphasis upon cycliclaw, and why there is a growing interest in the Science of Cyclic Manifestation.Death appears frequently to be so purposeless; that is because the intention ofthe soul is not known; past development, through the process of incarnation,remains a hidden matter; ancient heredities and environments are ignored, andrecognition of the voice of the soul is not yet generally developed. These arematters, however, which are on the very verge of recognition; revelation is onits way, and for that I am laying the foundation.I am anxious for you to grasp the teaching I have already given before weproceed to that which is explanatory or new. Study it with care so that thetheme of death can more surely and more sanely take shape in your mind. Seek toarrive at a new slant upon the subject and see law and purpose and the beauty ofintention in what has hitherto been a terror and a major fear.[437] Later I shall endeavour to give you some glimpse of the death process asthe soul registers it, when undertaking the act of restitution. To you, what Isay may appear as speculative or hypothetical; in any case it will be astatement of which few of you will be in a position to prove the accuracy. Butsurely, brother of mine, it may be more sane and wholesome, more sound andbeautiful, than the present darkness and sick hope, and the unhappy speculationand oft despair which overshadows every death bed at this time.1. THE NATURE OF DEATHEXCERPTS FROM OTHER WRITINGSThe whole must be seen as of more vital importance than the part, and this notas a dream, a vision, a theory, a process of wishful thinking, a hypothesis oran urge. It is realised as an innate necessity and as inevitable. It connotesdeath, but death as beauty, as joy, as spirit in action, as the consummation ofall good.A Treatise on the Seven Rays. Vol. V. page 99.Death, if we could but realise it, is one of our most practised activities. Wehave died many times and shall die again and again. Death is essentially amatter of consciousness. We are conscious one moment on the physical plane, anda moment later we have withdrawn into another plane and are actively consciousthere. Just as long as our consciousness is identified with the form aspect,death will hold for us its ancient terror. Just as soon as we know ourselves tobe souls, and find that we are capable of focussing our consciousness or senseof awareness in any form or on any plane at will, or in any direction within theform of God, we will no longer know death.A Treatise on White Magic, page 494.[438] Ponder, therefore, upon this doctrine of abstraction. It covers all lifeprocesses and will convey to you the eternally lovely secret of Death which isentrance into life.A Treatise on the Seven Rays. Vol. V. page 167.In this Rule, two main ideas are to be found, both of them connected with thefirst divine aspect: the thought of DEATH and the nature of the WILL. In thecoming century, death and the will most inevitably will be seen to have newmeanings to humanity and many of the old ideas will vanish. Death to the averagethinking man is a point of catastrophic crisis. It is the cessation and theending of all that has been loved, all that is familiar and to be desired; it isa crashing entrance into the unknown, into uncertainty, and abrupt conclusion ofall plans and projects. No matter how much true faith in the spiritual valuesmay be present, no matter how clear the rationalising of the mind may be anentimmortality, no matter how conclusive the evidence of persistence and eternity,there still remains a questioning, a recognition of the possibility of completefinality and negation, and an end of all activity, of all heart reaction, of allthought, emotion, desire, aspiration and the intentions which focus around thecentral core of man’s being. The longing and the determination to persist andthe sense of continuity still rest, even to the most determined believer, uponprobability, upon an unstable foundation and upon the testimony of others—whohave never in reality returned to tell the truth. The emphasis of all thought onthis subject concerns the central “I” or the integrity of Deity.You will note that in this Rule, the emphasis shifts from the “I” to theconstituent parts which form the garment of the Self, and this is a point worthnoting. The information given to the disciple is to work for the dissipation ofthis garment and for the return of the lesser lives to the general [439]reservoir of living substance. The ocean of Being is nowhere referred to.Careful thought will here show that this ordered process of detachment, whichthe group life makes effective in the case of the individual, is one of thestrongest arguments for the fact of continuity and for individual, identifiablepersistence. Note these words. The focus of activity shifts from the active bodyto the active entity within that body, the master of his surroundings, thedirector of his possessions and the one who is the breath itself, despatchingthe lives to the reservoir of substance or recalling them at will to resumetheir relation to him.A Treatise on the Seven Rays. Vol. V. pages 101-102.First of all that the Eternal Pilgrim, of his own free will and accord, chose“occultly” to die and took a body or series of bodies in order to raise orelevate the lives of the form nature which he embodied; in the process of sodoing, he himself “died” in the sense that, for a free soul, death and thetaking of a form and the consequent immersion of the life in the form, aresynonymous terms.Secondly, that in so doing, the soul is recapitulating on a small scale what thesolar Logos and the planetary Logos have likewise done, and are doing. The greatLives come under the rule of these laws of the soul during the period ofmanifestation, even though They are not governed or controlled by the laws ofthe natural world, as we call it. Their consciousness remains unidentified withthe world of phenomena, though ours is identified with it until such time thatwe come under the rule of the higher laws. By the occult “death” of these greatLives, all lesser lives can live and are proffered opportunity.A Treatise on the Seven Rays. Vol. V. page 172.The forces of death are abroad today, but it is the death of liberty, the deathof free speech, the death of [440] freedom in human action, the death of truthand of the higher spiritual values. These are the vital factors in the life ofhumanity. The death of the physical form is a negligible factor in relation tothese and is easily righted again through the processes of rebirth and of freshopportunity....The destruction of the form in battle is of small importance tothose who know that reincarnation is a basic law of nature and that there is nodeath.June Message, 1940.You say there are as yet only beliefs as to immortality, and no sure evidences.In the accumulation of testimony, in the inner assurances of the human heart, inthe fact of belief in eternal persistence as an idea in the minds of men, liesure indication. But indication will give place to conviction and knowledgebefore another hundred years has elapsed, for an event will take place and arevelation be given the race which will turn hope into certainty and belief intoknowledge. In the meantime, let a new attitude to death be cultivated and a newscience of death be inaugurated. Let it cease to be the one thing we cannotcontrol and which inevitably defeats us, and let us begin to control our passingover to the other side, and to understand somewhat the technique of transition.A Treatise on White Magic, page 500.All I plead for is a sane approach to death; all I seek to make is a suggestionthat when pain has worn itself out and weakness has supervened, the dying personbe permitted to prepare himself, even if apparently unconscious, for the greattransition. Forget not that it takes strength and a strong hold on the nervousapparatus to produce pain. Is it impossible to conceive of a time when the actof dying will be a triumphant finale to life? Is it impossible [441] to visionthe time when the hours spent on the death bed may be but a glorious prelude toa conscious exit? When the fact that the man is to discard the handicap of thephysical sheath may be for him and those around him the long-waited-for andjoyous consummation? Can you not visualise the time when, instead of tears andfears and the refusal to recognise the inevitable, the dying person and hisfriends would mutually agree on the hour, and that nothing but happiness wouldcharacterise the passing? That in the minds of those left behind the thought ofsorrow will not enter and death beds shall be regarded as happier occasions thanbirths and marriages? I tell you that, before so very long, this will be deeplyso for the intelligent of the race, and little by little for all.A Treatise on White Magic, page 499.It is interesting here to note that death is governed by the Principle ofLiberation and not by that of Limitation. Death is only recognised as a factorto be dealt with by self-conscious lives and is only misunderstood by humanbeings, who are the most glamoured and deluded of all incarnated lives.A Treatise on white Magic, page 534.When the nature of true Service is comprehended, it will be found that it is anaspect of that divine energy which works always under the destroyer aspect, forit destroys the forms in order to release. Service is a manifestation of thePrinciple of Liberation, and of this principle, death and service constitute twoaspects. Service saves, liberates and releases, on various levels, theimprisoned consciousness. The same statements can be made of death. But unlessservice can be rendered from an intuitive understanding of all the facts in thecase, interpreted intelligently, and applied [442] in a spirit of love upon thephysical plane, it fails to fulfill its mission adequately.A Treatise on White Magic, page 537.Fear of Death.The fear of death is based upon:a. A terror of the final rending processes in the act of death itself.b. Horror of the unknown and the indefinable.c. Doubt as to final immortality.d. Unhappiness at leaving loved ones behind or of being left behind.e. Ancient reactions to past violent deaths, lying deep in the consciousness.f. Clinging to form life, because primarily identified with it in consciousness.g. Old erroneous teaching as to Heaven and Hell, both equally unpleasant inprospect to certain types.A Treatise on White Magic, page 300.As time progresses and before the close of the next century, death will befinally seen to be nonexistent in the sense in which it is now understood.Continuity of consciousness will be so widely developed, and so many of thehighest types of men will function simultaneously in the two worlds, that theold fear will go and the intercourse between the astral plane and the physicalplane will be so firmly established and so scientifically controlled that thework of the trance mediums will rightly and mercifully come to an end. Theordinary common trance mediumship and materialisations under controls and Indianguides are just as much perversions of the intercourse between the two planes asare sex perversions and the distortions of the [443] true relationship andintercourse between the sexes. I refer not here to the work of clairvoyants, nomatter how poor, nor to the taking possession of the body by entities of highcalibre, but of the unpleasant phenomena of the materialisation seance, ofectoplasm and the blind unintelligent work done by the old Atlantean degeneratesand earthbound souls, the average Indian chief and guide. There is nothing to belearned from them, and much to be avoided.The reign of the fear of death is well-nigh ended and we shall soon enter upon aperiod of knowledge and of certainty which will cut the ground from under allour fears. In dealing with the fear of death, there is little to be done exceptto raise the whole subject onto a more scientific level, and—in this scientificsense—teach people to die. There is a technique of dying just as there is ofliving, but this technique has been lost very largely in the West, and is almostlost except in a few centres of Knowers in the East. More of this can perhaps bedealt with later, but the thought of the needed approach to this subject canrest in the minds of students who read this, and perhaps as they study and readand think, material of interest will come their way which could be graduallyassembled and published.A Treatise on White Magic, pages 301-302.Fear of death and depression constitute for man the Dweller on the Threshold inthis age and cycle. Both of them indicate sentient reaction to psychologicalfactors and cannot be dealt with by the use of another factor such as courage.They must be met by the omniscience of the soul, working through the mind—not byits omnipotence. In this is to be found an occult hint.A Treatise on White Magic, page 309.The instinct of self-preservation has its roots in an innate fear of death;through the presence of this fear, the [444] race has fought its way to itspresent point of longevity and endurance.A Treatise on White Magic, page 626.Definition of Death .Death itself is a part of the Great Illusion, and only exists because of theveils we have gathered around ourselves.A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. V. page 463.But people are apt to forget that every night in the hours of sleep we die tothe physical plane and are alive and functioning elsewhere. They forget thatthey have already achieved facility in leaving the physical body; because theycannot as yet bring back into the physical brain consciousness the recollectionof that passing out, and of the subsequent interval of active living, they failto relate death and sleep. Death is, after all, only a longer interval in thelife of physical plane functioning; one has only “gone abroad” for a longerperiod. But the process of daily sleep and the process of occasional dying areidentical, with the one difference that in sleep the magnetic thread or currentof energy along which the life force streams is preserved intact, andconstitutes the path of return to the body. In death, this life thread is brokenor snapped. When this has happened, the conscious entity cannot return to thedense physical body, and that body, lacking the principle of coherence, thendisintegrates.A Treatise on White Magic, page 494.The processes of abstraction are (as you may thus see) connected with the lifeaspect, are set in motion by an act of the spiritual will, and constitute the“resurrection principle which lies hidden in the work of the Destroyer,” as anold esoteric saying expresses it. The lowest manifestation [445] of thisprinciple is to be seen in the process of what we call death—which is in realitya means of abstracting the life principle, informed by consciousness, from theform of the bodies in the three worlds.Thus, the great synthesis emerges and destruction, death, and dissolution are,in reality, naught but life processes. Abstraction is indicative of process,progress and development. It is this aspect of the Law of Life (or the Law ofSynthesis as it is called in certain larger connotations) with which theinitiate specifically deals.A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. V. page 163.Life is approached from the angle of the Observer, and not from that of aparticipator in actual experiment and experience in the three worlds(physical-emotional-mental)...if they are initiated disciples they areincreasingly unaware of the activities and reactions of their personalities,because certain aspects of the lower nature are now so controlled and purifiedthat they have dropped below the threshold of consciousness and have entered theworld of instinct; therefore, there is no more awareness of them than a manasleep is conscious of the rhythmic functioning of his sleeping physicalvehicle. This is a deep and largely unrealised truth. It is related to theentire process of death, and might be regarded as one of the definitions ofdeath; it holds the clue to the mysterious words “the reservoir of life.” Deathis in reality unconsciousness of that which may be functioning in some form oranother, but in a form of which the spiritual entity is totally unaware. Thereservoir of life is the place of death, and this is the first lesson thedisciple learns....A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. V. pages 99-100..Purposes of Death .Through death, a great at-one-ing process is carried [446] forward; in the “fallof a leaf” and its consequent identification with the soil on which it falls, wehave a tiny illustration of this great and eternal process of at-one-ing,through becoming and dying as a result of becoming.A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. II, page 173.I speak about Death as one who knows the matter from the outer world experienceand the inner life expression: There is no death . There is, as you know,entrance into fuller life. There is freedom from the handicaps of the fleshlyvehicle. The rending process so much dreaded does not exist, except in the casesof violent and sudden death, and then the only true disagreeables are an instantand overwhelming sense of imminent peril and destruction and something closelyapproaching an electric shock. No more. For the unevolved, death is literally asleep and a forgetting, for the mind is not sufficiently awakened to react, andthe storehouse of memory is as yet practically empty. For the average goodcitizen, death is a continuance of the living process in his consciousness and acarrying forward of the interests and tendencies of the life. His consciousnessand his sense of awareness are the same and unaltered. He does not sense muchdifference, is well taken care of, and oft is unaware that he has passed throughthe episode of death. For the wicked and cruelly selfish, for the criminal andfor those few who live for the material side only, there eventuates thatcondition which we call “earth-bound.” The links they have forged with earth andthe earthward bias of all their desires, force them to remain close to the earthand their last setting in the earth environment. They seek desperately and byevery possible means to re-contact it and to re-enter. In a few cases, greatpersonal love for those left behind, or the nonfulfillment of a recognised andurgent duty, holds the good and beautiful in a somewhat similar [447] condition.For the aspirant, death is an immediate entrance into a sphere of service and ofexpression to which he is well accustomed and which he at once recognises as notnew. In his sleeping hours he has developed a field of active service and oflearning. He now simply functions in it for the entire twenty-four hours(talking in terms of physical plane time) instead of for his usual few hours ofearthly sleep.A Treatise on White Magic, pages 300-301.True death, under the Law, is brought about by the attainment of the objective,and hence by the cessation of aspiration. The etheric double of a man, aplanetary Logos, and a solar Logos, being shattered, becomes non-polarised asregards its indweller, and permits therefore of escape. It is (to word itotherwise) no longer a source of attraction, nor a focal magnetic point. Itbecomes non-magnetic, and the great Law of Attraction ceases to control it;hence disintegration is the ensuing condition of the form.A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, pages 129-130.“The Law demands the entrance of that which can effect a change.”Bearing in mind what I have elsewhere given, it is obvious that that which mustfind entrance is that vital concentrated will which, when set in motion in anindividual, in a group, in a nation, in a kingdom of nature (a planetarycentre), and in the planet as a whole, i.e., in all the planetary centressimultaneously, will cause a stirring, a changed measure, a new movement andmomentum, an uprising and a consequent abstraction. The changes wrought in thecentres when the death of the physical body is taking place have never yet beenobserved or recorded; they are, however, definitely present to the eye of theinitiate and prove most interesting and informative. It is the recognition ofthe condition of the centres which enables the initiate [448] to know—when inprocess of bestowing healing—whether the physical healing of the body ispermissible or not. He can see, by looking, whether the will principle ofabstraction, to which I have been referring, is actively present or not. Thesame process can be seen taking place in organisations and in civilisations inwhich the form aspect is being destroyed in order that the life may beabstracted and later again rebuild for itself a more adequate form. It is thesame under the great processes of initiation, which are not only processes ofexpanding the consciousness but are rooted in the death or the abstractionprocess, leading to resurrection and ascension.That which effects a change is a discharge (to use a totally inadequate phrase)of directed and focussed will-energy. This is so magnetic in quality that itdraws to itself the life of the centres, bringing about the dissolution of theform but the release of the life. Death comes to the individual man in theordinary sense of the term when the will-to-live in a physical body goes and thewill-to-abstract takes its place. This we call death. In cases of death in war,for instance, it is not then a case of the individual will-to-withdraw, but anenforced participation in a great group abstraction. From its own place, thesoul of the individual man recognises the end of a cycle of incarnation, andrecalls its life. This it does through a discharge of the will-energy that isstrong enough to bring about the change....Christ referred to this work ofabstraction as regards the third great planetary centre, Humanity, when He said(and He was speaking as the Representative of the Hierarchy, the secondplanetary centre, into which all human beings achieving initiation are“withdrawn” esoterically), “I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me.” Adifferent word to this word of His will be spoken at the end of the age when theLord of the World will speak from Shamballa [449] (the first planetary centre),will abstract the life principle from the Hierarchy, and all life andconsciousness will then be focussed in the planetary head centre—the GreatCouncil Chamber at Shamballa.“The Law demands that the changes thus effected remove the form, bring qualityto light, and lay the emphasis upon life.”Here the three great aspects—form, quality, and life—are brought into relation,and the point of the evolutionary objective is seen in its true light—LIFE. Notethis phrasing. Form or appearance, having served its purpose, disappears. Deathof the form takes place. Quality, the major divine attribute being developed inthis planet, becomes dominant, is “conscious of itself”—as the ancient writingsput it. It is identified and individual, but has no implementing form, exceptthat of the greater whole in which it finds its place. Neither form nor quality(body nor consciousness) are paramount in the new state of being, only the lifeaspect, the spirit on its own plane becomes the dominating factor. Some faintdim light on the significance of this may come if you bear in mind that ourseven planes are only the seven subplanes of the cosmic physical plane. Theprocess of developing sensitivity in this sevenfold evolution has been undergonein order to enable the initiate to function upon the cosmic astral plane, whenwithdrawn or abstracted after the higher initiations. He is abstracted from ourplanetary life altogether. Only one factor could prevent this, and that might behis pledge to serve temporarily within the planetary ring-pass-not. Such membersof the Hierarchy Who pledge Themselves to this work are stated to have Buddhicconsciousness, and the line of Their descent (occultly understood) is from theEternal Pilgrim, the Lord of the World, then the Buddha, and then the Christ.They remain identified through free choice with the “quality seen [450] withinthe light” and, for the term of Their freely rendered service, work with theconsciousness aspect in order to lay the emphasis later upon the life aspect. .. .A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. V. pages 164-166.The eighteen fires must die down; the lesser lives (embodying the principle ofform, of desire and of thought, the sumtotal of creativity, based upon magneticlove) must return to the reservoir of life and naught be left but that whichcaused them to be, the central will which is known by the effects of itsradiation or breath.This dispersal, death or dissolution, is in reality a great effect produced bythe central Cause, and the injunction is consequently: “This they must bringabout by the evocation of the Will. ”...The disciple finds his group in theMaster’s Ashram and consciously and with full understanding masters death—thelong-feared enemy of existence. He discovers that death is simply an effectproduced by life and by his conscious will, and is a mode whereby he directssubstance and controls matter. This becomes consciously possible because, havingdeveloped awareness of two divine aspects—creative activity and love—he is nowfocussed in the highest aspect and knows himself to be the WILL, the Life, theFather, the Monad, the One.A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. V. pages 104-105.A great upheaval in all the kingdoms in nature has characterised this day andgeneration; a stupendous destruction of all forms of divine life and in everykingdom has been the outstanding note of this upheaval. Our modern civilisationhas received a death blow from which it will never recover, but which will berecognised some day as the “blow of release” and as the signal for that which isbetter, new and more suitable for the evolving spirit, to make its appearance.Great and penetrating energies and their [451] evoked forces have met inconflict which has, figuratively speaking, elevated the mineral kingdom into theskies and which has brought down fire from heaven. I am talking to you factuallyand not just symbolically. The bodies of men, women and children, as well asanimals, have been destroyed; the forms of the vegetable kingdom and thepotencies of the mineral kingdom have been disintegrated, distributed anddevastated. The coherent life of all the planetary forms has been temporarilyrendered incoherent. As an ancient prophecy has put it: “No true united Soundgoes out from form to form, from life to life. Only a cry of pain, a demand forrestitution and an invocation for relief from agony, despair and fruitlesseffort goes out from here to There.”All this upheaval of the “soil” of the world—spiritual, psychological andphysical—all this disruption of the forms and of the familiar contours of ourplanetary life, had to take place before there could come the emergence of theHierarchy into the public consciousness; all this had to do its work upon thesouls of men before the New Age could come in, bringing with it the Restorationof the Mysteries and the rehabilitation of the peoples of the Earth. The two gotogether. This is one of the major points which I am seeking to make. Thedisruption, disintegration and the completely chaotic conditions existing forthe past five hundred years within all the kingdoms of nature have at lastworked their way out into paralleling physical conditions. This is good anddesirable; it marks the prelude to a better building of a better world, and theconstruction of more adequate forms of life and of more correct human attitudes,plus a sounder orientation to reality. The best is yet to be.Everything is being rapidly brought to the surface—the good and the bad, thedesirable and the undesirable, the [452] past and the future (for the two areone); the plough of God has nearly accomplished its work; the sword of thespirit has severed an evil past from the radiant future, and both are seen ascontributory in the Eye of God; our material civilisation will be seen as givingplace rapidly to a more spiritual culture; our church organisations, with theirlimiting and confusing theologies, will soon give place to the Hierarchy withits emerging teaching—clear, factual, intuitive and nondogmatic.A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. V. pages 134-135.Intense desire for sentient existence or attachment. This is inherent in everyform, is self-perpetuating and known even to the very wise.When the life or Spirit withdraws itself, the form dies, occultly. When thethought of the ego or higher self is occupied with its own plane, there is noenergy outgoing towards the matter of the three worlds, and so no form-buildingand form-attachment is there possible. This is in line with the occult truismthat “energy follows thought,” and is in line, too, with the teaching that thebody of the Christ principle (the Buddhic vehicle) only begins to coordinate asthe lower impulses fade out....Attachment to form or the attraction of form forSpirit is the great involutionary impulse. Repulsion of form and consequent formdisintegration is the great evolutionary urge.The Light of the Soul, pages 137-8.When the cause, desire, has produced its effect, the personality or form aspectof man, then as long as the will to live exists, so long will the form persist.It is kept in manifestation through mental vitality. This has been demonstratedtime and again in the annals of medicine, for it has been proven that as long asthe determination to live persists, so will be the probable duration of thephysical plane [453] life; but that the moment that will is withdrawn, or theinterest of the dweller in the body is no longer centered upon personalitymanifestation, death ensues and the disintegration of that mind-image, the body,takes place.The Light of the Soul, page 397.There are two main lines of evolution, that which concerns matter and form, andthat which concerns the soul, the consciousness aspect, the thinker inmanifestation. For each of these the path of progress differs, and each pursuesits course. As has been noted, for a long period of time the soul identifiesitself with the form aspect and endeavours to follow the “Path of Death,” forthat is what the dark path is in fact to the thinker. Later, through strenuouseffort, this identification ceases; the soul becomes aware of itself, and of itsown path, or dharma, and follows then the way of light and of life. It shouldever be borne in mind, however, that for the two aspects their own path is theright path, and that the impulses which lie hidden in the physical vehicle or inthe astral body are not in themselves wrong. They become wrong from certainangles when twisted from their right use, and it was this realisation that ledthe disciple in the Book of Job to cry out and say, “I have perverted that whichwas right.” The two lines of development are separate and distinct, and thisevery aspirant has to learn.The Light of the Soul, pages 402-403.The Art of Dying .The soul, seated in the heart, is the life principle, the principle ofself-determination, the central nucleus of positive energy by means of which allthe atoms of the body are held in their right place and subordinated to the“will-to-be” of the soul. This principle of life utilises the blood stream [454]as its mode of expression and as its controlling agency, and through the closerelation of the endocrine system to the blood stream, we have the two aspects ofsoul activity brought together in order to make man a living, conscious,functioning entity, governed by the soul, and expressing the purpose of the soulin all the activities of daily living.Death, therefore, is literally the withdrawal from the heart and from the headof these two streams of energy, producing consequently complete loss ofconsciousness and disintegration of the body. Death differs from sleep in thatboth streams of energy are withdrawn. In sleep, only the thread of energy whichis anchored in the brain is withdrawn, and when this happens the man becomesunconscious. By this we mean that his consciousness or sense of awareness isfocussed elsewhere. His attention is no longer directed towards things tangibleand physical, but is turned upon another world of being and becomes centered inanother apparatus or mechanism. In death, both the threads are withdrawn orunified in the life thread. Vitality ceases to penetrate through the medium ofthe blood stream and the heart fails to function, just as the brain fails torecord, and thus silence settles down. The house is empty. Activity ceases,except that amazing and immediate activity which is the prerogative of matteritself and which expresses itself in the process of decomposition. From certainaspects, therefore, that process indicates man’s unity with everything that ismaterial; it demonstrates that he is a part of nature itself, and by nature wemean the body of the one Life in whom “we live and move and have our being.” Inthose three words—living, moving and being—we have the entire story. Being isawareness, self-consciousness and self-expression, and of this man’s head andbrain are the exoteric symbols. Living is energy, desire in form, coherence andadhesion to an idea, and of this the heart and the blood are the exoteric [455]symbols. Moving indicates the integration and response of the existing, aware,living entity into the universal activity, and of this the stomach, pancreas andliver are the symbols.It must be noted also that death is, therefore, undertaken at the direction ofthe Ego, no matter how unaware a human being may be of that direction . Theprocess works automatically with the majority, for (when the soul withdraws itsattention) the inevitable reaction on the physical plane is either death, by theabstraction of the dual threads of life and reason energy, or by the abstractionof the thread of energy which is qualified by mentality, leaving the life streamstill functioning through the heart, but no intelligent awareness. The soul isengaged elsewhere and occupied on its own plane with its own affairs.A Treatise on White Magic, pages 496-497.Before I take up this subject in greater detail I would like to make somereference to the “web in the brain,” which is intact for the majority but isnon-existent for the illumined seer.In the human body, as you know, we have an underlying, extensive vital bodywhich is the counterpart of the physical, which is larger than the physical andwhich we call the etheric body or double. It is an energy body and is composedof force centres and nadis or force threads. These underlie or are thecounterparts of the nervous apparatus—the nerves and the nerve ganglia. In twoplaces in the human body there are orifices of exit, if I may use so cumbersomea phrase. One opening is in the solar plexus and the other is in the brain atthe top of the head. Protecting both is a closely woven web of etheric matter,composed of interlacing strands of life energy.During the process of death the pressure of the life energy beating against theweb produces eventually a puncturing [456] or opening. Out of this the lifeforce pours as the potency of the abstracting influence of the soul increases.In the case of animals, of infants and of men and women who are polarisedentirely in the physical and astral bodies, the door of exit is the solarplexus, and it is that web which is punctured, thus permitting the passing out.In the case of mental types, of the more highly evolved human units, it is theweb at the top of the head in the region of the fontenelle which is ruptured,thus again permitting the exit of the thinking rational being.In the process of death these are, therefore, the two main exits: the solarplexus for the astrally polarised, physically biased human being, and thereforeof the vast majority, and the head centre for the mentally polarised andspiritually oriented human being. This is the first and most important factor toremember, and it will easily be seen how the trend of a life tendency and thefocus of the life attention determine the mode of exit at death. It can be seenalso that an effort to control the astral life and the emotional nature, and toorient one’s self to the mental world and to spiritual things, has a momentouseffect upon the phenomenal aspects of the death process.If the student is thinking clearly, it will be apparent to him that one exitconcerns the spiritual and highly evolved man, whilst the other concerns the lowgrade human being who has scarcely advanced beyond the animal stage. What thenof the average man? A third exit is now in temporary use; just below the apex ofthe heart another etheric web is found covering an orifice of exit. We have,therefore, the following situation:1. The exit in the head, used by the intellectual type, by the disciples andinitiates of the world. [457]2. The exit in the heart, used by the kindly, well-meaning man or woman who is agood citizen, an intelligent friend and a philanthropic worker.3. The exit in the region of the solar plexus, used by those whose animal natureis strong.This is the first point in the new information which will slowly become commonknowledge in the West during the next century. Much of it is already known bythinkers in the East and is in the nature of a first step towards a rationalunderstanding of the death process.A Treatise on White Magic, page 500.In relation to the technique of dying, it is only possible for me at this timeto make one or two suggestions. I deal not here with the attitude of theattendant watchers, I deal only with those points which will make for an easierpassing over of the transient soul. First, let there be silence in the chamber. This is, of course, frequently thecase. It must be remembered that the dying person may usually be unconscious.This unconsciousness is apparent but not real. In nine hundred cases out of athousand the brain awareness is there, with a full consciousness of happenings,but there is a complete paralysis of the will to express and complete inabilityto generate the energy which will indicate aliveness. When silence andunderstanding rule the sick room, the departing soul can hold possession of itsinstrument with clarity until the last minute, and can make due preparation.Later, when more anent colour is known, only orange lights will be permitted inthe sick room of a dying person, and these will only be installed with dueceremony when there is assuredly no possibility of recovery. Orange aids thefocussing in the head, just as red stimulates the solar [458] plexus and greenhas a definite effect upon the heart and life streams.Certain types of music will be used when more in connection with sound isunderstood, but there is no music as yet which will facilitate the work of thesoul in abstracting itself from the body, though certain notes on the organ willbe found effective. At the exact moment of death, if a person’s own note issounded, it will coordinate the two streams of energy and eventually rupture thelife thread, but the knowledge of this is too dangerous to transmit as yet andcan only later be given. I would indicate the future and the lines along whichfuture occult study will run.It will be found also that pressure on certain nerve centres and on certainarteries will facilitate the work, and this science of dying is held in custody,as many students know, in Tibet. Pressure on the jugular vein and on certain bignerves in the region of the head and on a particular spot in the medullaoblongata will be found helpful and effective. A definite science of death willinevitably later be elaborated, but only when the fact of the soul is recognisedand its relation to the body has been scientifically demonstrated.Mantric phrases will also be employed and definitely built into theconsciousness of the dying person by those around him, or employed deliberatelyand mentally by himself. The Christ demonstrated their use when He cried aloud,“Father, into thy hands, I commend My spirit.” And we have another instance inthe words, “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.” The steady useof the Sacred Word, chanted in an undertone or on a particular key (to which thedying man will be found to respond), may later constitute also a part of theritual of transition, accompanied by the anointing with oil, as preserved in theCatholic Church. Extreme Unction has an occult, scientific basis. The top of thehead of the dying [459] man should also symbolically point towards the East, andthe feet and hands should be crossed. Sandalwood only should be burned in theroom, and no incense of any other kind permitted, for sandalwood is the incenseof the First or Destroyer Ray, and the soul is in process of destroying itshabitation.A Treatise on White Magic, page 505.If there is one factor aspirants recognise, it is the need of freeing themselvesfrom the Great Illusion. Arjuna knew this, yet succumbed to despair. Yet in hishour of need, Krishna failed him not, but laid down in the Gita the simple ruleswhereby depression and doubt can be overcome. They may be briefly summarised asfollows:a. Know thyself to be the undoing One.b. Control thy mind, for through that mind the undying One can be known.c. Learn that the form is but the veil which hides the splendour of Divinity.d. Realise that the One Life pervades all forms, so there is no death, nodistress, no separation.e. Detach thyself therefore from the form side and come to Me, so dwelling inthe place where Light and Life are found. Thus illusion ends.A Treatise on White Magic, page 308.A Master learns the meaning of each confining form; then He assumes control andwields the law upon the plane consistent with the form. He has then outgrown theform and discards it for other and higher forms. Thus, He has progressed alwaysby means of the sacrifice and death of the form. Always, it is recognised asimprisoning, always it must be sacrificed and die so that the life within mayspeed ever on and up. The path of resurrection presupposes [460] crucifixion anddeath, and then leads to the mount whence Ascension may be made.Letters on Occult Meditation, page 261.2. THE ACT OF RESTITUTIONIn considering the consciousness of the departing soul (note that phrase) as itundertakes the act of restitution, I would again point out that I am dealingwith a subject of which there is no tangible physical proof. Occasionally menare brought back again into physical plane existence when at the exact point ofcomplete physical restitution. This can only be done as long as the consciousentity is still occupying the etheric vehicle, though the discarding of thedense physical body has to all intents and purposes been completed. Though theetheric body interpenetrates the entire physical body, it is much larger thanthat body, and the astral body and the mental nature can still remainetherically polarised even if the death of the physical body—the cessation ofall heart activity and the concentration of the basic etheric focus in theregion of the head, or the heart, or the solar plexus—has been effective and thewithdrawal is already well under way.The etheric forces are first of all withdrawn into the surrounding extension ofthe etheric ring-pass-not, prior to that final dissipation which leaves the manfree to stand as a human soul within the ring-pass-not of his astral vehicle.You have here a somewhat new aspect of the death process. The withdrawal of theetheric body from occupation of the dense physical body has oft been posited andpresented. But even when that has been accomplished, death is not yet complete;it still awaits a secondary activity of the will of the soul. This secondaryactivity will result in all the etheric forces dissolving into an emanatingsource which is the [461] general reservoir of forces. Forget not that theetheric body has no distinctive life of its own. It is only an amalgamation ofall the forces and energies which animated the physical body and whichgalvanised it into activity during the outer life cycle. Remember also that thefive centres up the spine are not within the physical body, but are found atcertain distinctive points in the paralleling etheric substance; they are (evenin the case of the undeveloped man, and still more in the case of the averageman) at least two inches away from the physical spine. The three head centresare also outside the dense physical body. The recollection of this willfacilitate your understanding of the statement that the physical body is, per se, vacated when death is assumed by the watching authorities, but that,nevertheless, the man may not be truly dead. I would remind you also that thisis equally true of the many minor centres as well as of the major centres, withwhich we are so familiar.The last of the minor centres to “fade out into nothingness,” in order to beresolved into the totality of etheric substance, are two which are closelyrelated to and in the region of the lungs. It is on these two centres that thesoul works if recalled into the dense physical body for some reason. It is whenthey swing into a returning or a fresh in-going activity that the breath of lifereturns to the vacated physical form. It is an unconscious realisation of thiswhich constitutes the prompting cause of the process which is normally carriedout in all cases of drowning or of asphyxiation. When a man has succumbed todisease and the physical body is consequently weakened, such restorativeexercises are not possible and should not be employed. In cases of sudden deaththrough accident, suicide, murder, unexpected heart attacks or through theprocesses of war, the shock is such that the somewhat leisurely process of soulwithdrawal is entirely offset, and the vacating of the physical [462] body andthe complete dissolution of the etheric body are practically simultaneous. Innormal cases of death from disease, the withdrawal is slow, and (where themalignancy of the disease has not caused too great deterioration of the physicalorganism involved) there is the possibility of a return for a shorter or alonger period of time. This frequently happens, especially when the will to liveis strong or the life task remains as yet unaccomplished and is not correctlyconcluded.There is another point upon which I wish to touch and which has relation to theeternal conflict being waged between the dualities of the dense physical bodyand the etheric vehicle. The physical elemental (which is the name given to theintegrated life of the physical body) and the soul, as it seeks to withdraw anddissolve the sumtotal of the combined energies of the etheric body, are inviolent conflict and the process is often fierce and long; it is this battlewhich is being waged during the long or short period of coma which characterisesso many death beds. Coma, esoterically speaking, is of two kinds: there is the“coma of battle” which precedes true death; there is also the “coma ofrestoration” which takes place when the soul has withdrawn the consciousnessthread or aspect, but not the life thread, in an effort to give the physicalelemental time to regain its grip upon the organism and thus to restore health.As yet, modern science does not recognise the distinction between these twoaspects of coma. Later, when etheric or clairvoyant vision is more common, thequality of the coma prevailing will be known, and the elements of hope or ofdespair will no longer control. The friends and relations of the unconsciousperson will know exactly whether they are watching a great and final withdrawalfrom present incarnation or simply looking on at a restorative process. In thelatter case, the soul is still retaining its hold upon [463] the physical body,via the centres, but is withstanding temporarily all energising processes. Theexceptions to this withstraint are the heart centre, the spleen, and two minorcentres connected with the breathing apparatus. These will remain normallyenergised, even if somewhat weakened in their activity; and through them controlis retained. When true death is the soul’s intention, then control over thespleen first of all takes place; then control over the two minor centresfollows, and finally control over the heart centre supervenes and the man dies.The above will give you some idea of the many points connected with dying thatstill remain to be discovered by orthodox medicine, and which will be revealedas the race of men reaches an increasing sensitivity.I would ask you to remember that in all our present considerations we aredealing with the reactions and activities of the soul which is deliberatelyrecalling its incarnated aspect because a life cycle has been concluded. Theterm of that life cycle may be long or short, according to the purposesinvolved; it may cover only a very few short years, or a century. Prior to theseventh year, the vitality of the physical elemental is largely the determiningfactor. The soul is then focussed in the etheric body, but is not fullyutilising all the centres; it has simply a gently pulsating control and a gentleimpulsive activity—sufficient to preserve consciousness, to vitalise the variousphysical processes, and to initiate the demonstration of character and ofdisposition. These become increasingly marked until the twenty-first year, whenthey stabilise into what we call the personality. In the case of disciples, thegrip of the soul upon the etheric centres will be more powerful from the verystart of the physical existence. By the time the fourteenth year is reached, thequality and the nature of the incarnated soul and its approximate age orexperience are determined, the [464] physical, astral and mental elementals areunder control, and the soul, the indwelling spiritual man, already determinesthe life tendencies and choices.In the case of the ordinary man, where death is intended, the battle between thephysical elemental and the soul is a distinctive factor; it is occultly called a“Lemurian departure”; in the case of the average citizen, where the focus of thelife is in the desire nature, the conflict is between the astral elemental andthe soul, and this is given the name “the death of an Atlantean”; wheredisciples are concerned, the conflict will be more purely mental and is oftfocussed around the will-to-serve and the determination to fulfill a particularaspect of the Plan and the will-to-return in full force to the ashramic centre.Where initiates are concerned, there is no conflict, but simply a conscious anddeliberate withdrawal. Curiously enough, if there appears to be a conflict, itwill be between the two elemental forces then remaining in the personality: thephysical elemental and the mental life. There is no astral elemental to be foundin the equipment of an initiate of high standing. Desire has been completelytranscended as far as the individual’s own nature is involved.Factors Confronting the Withdrawing SoulIn physical death, therefore, and in the act of restitution, the withdrawingsoul has to deal with the following factors:1. The physical elemental, the integrated and coordinated life of the physicalbody, which is forever seeking to hold together under the attractive forces ofall its component parts and their mutual interaction. This force works through anumber of minor centres.2. The etheric vehicle, which has a powerful coordinated life of its own,expressed through the seven [465] major centres which react under astral, mentaland soul impulsive energy. It works also through certain of the minor centreswhich are not dedicated to a response to that aspect of the man’s equipmentwhich H.P.B. states is not a principle—the dense physical mechanism.The minor centres are therefore to be found existing in two groups: Thoseresponsive to the life of dense matter, to the mother aspect, and which aredefinitely upon the involutionary arc; these are an inheritance from theprevious solar system wherein the entire man was controlled via these minorcentres, with only a very few of the major centres dimly indicated in the caseof initiates and advanced disciples of that time; secondly, those centres whichare responsive to energies reaching them via the major centres; these then comeunder the control of the astral body and the mental apparatus. You will seeconsequently why, earlier in this treatise, I made the following reference tothe minor centres. It might be of interest to you, nevertheless, to be toldwhere the twenty-one minor centres are to be found. They can be located at thefollowing points:1. There are two in front of the ears, close to where the jaw bones areconnected.2. There are two just above the two breasts.3. There is one where the breast bone connects, close to the thyroid gland.This, with the two breast centres, makes a triangle of force.4. There are two, one each in the palms of the hands.5. There are two, one each in the soles of the feet.6. There are two, just behind the eyes.7. There are two, also, connected with the gonads.8. There is one close to the liver. [466]9. There is one connected with the stomach; it is related, therefore, to thesolar plexus, but is not identical with it.10. There are two connected with the spleen. These form one centre in reality,but such a centre is formed by the two being superimposed one on the other.11. There are two—one at the back of each knee.12. There is one powerful centre which is closely connected with the vagusnerve. This is most potent and is regarded by some schools of occultism as amajor centre; it is not in the spine, but is no great distance from the thymusgland.13. There is one which is close to the solar plexus, and relates it to thecentre at the base of the spine, thus making a triangle of the sacral centre,the solar plexus, and the centre at the base of the spine.The two triangles referred to in this tabulation are of real importance. One isabove and the other below the diaphragm.Again, the death process can be seen as a dual activity and one which primarilyconcerns the etheric body. There is first of all the collecting and thewithdrawing of the etheric substance, so that it no longer interpenetrates thedense physical organism, and its subsequent densification (a word I deliberatelychoose) in that area of the etheric body which has always surrounded, but notpenetrated, the dense vehicle. This has been sometimes erroneously called thehealth aura, and it can be photographed more easily and successfully during theprocess of dying than at any other time, owing to the accumulation of thewithdrawn forces for several inches external to the tangible body. It is at thispoint in the experience of the withdrawing soul that the “word of death” isspoken, and it is prior to this enunciation [467] of this word that a return tophysical living can be possible and the withdrawn etheric forces can againinterpenetrate the body. Relationship with all the withdrawn forces is, up tothis point, retained via the head or the heart or the solar plexus, as well asvia the two minor chest centres.All this time the consciousness of the dying man is focussed in either theemotional (or astral) body or the mental vehicle, according to the point inevolution. He is not unconscious as the onlooker might infer, but is fully awarewithin himself of what is occurring. If he is strongly focussed on physicalplane life, and if that is the dominating desire of which he is the most aware,he may then intensify the conflict; you will then have the physical elementalbattling furiously for existence, the desire nature fighting to retard theprocesses of death, and the soul, intent upon the work of abstraction and ofrestitution. This can and frequently does occasion a struggle which is quiteapparent to the onlookers. As the race of men progresses and develops, thistriple struggle will become much rarer; desire for physical plane existence willnot appear so attractive, and the activity of the astral body will die out.I wish you could get a picture (symbolically considered) of a man who is in fullincarnation and rooted in his phase of experience, and of a man who iswithdrawing from that experience. It connotes a repetition on a tiny scale ofthe great planetary processes of involution and evolution; it concerns thoseactivities which produce a focussing or a polarisation in one of two directions;it resembles what might be regarded as a process of pouring in life and lightinto a vessel upon the physical plane, or an intensification of the radiation ofthat life and light of so potent a nature that under the evocative power of thesoul they are both withdrawn and gathered up into the centre of life and lightfrom whence they originally came. I have here given you [468] (could you butrecognise it) a definition of initiation, but one of a somewhat unusualphrasing. Perhaps some lines from the Manual of Death which is to be found inthe hierarchical archives would prove explanatory to you, and might aid you ingaining a new perspective upon death. This manual has in it what are called the“Formulas preceding Pralaya.” These deal with all the death or abstractionprocesses, covering the death of all forms, whether it be the death of an ant, aman or a planet. The formulas concern only the two aspects of life and light—thefirst conditioned by Sound and the second by the Word. The writing which I havein mind concerns the light, and the Word which abstracts it from the form orfocusses it within the form.“Bear in mind, O Chela, that within the known spheres naught is but lightresponsive to the WORD. Know that that light descends and concentrates itself;know that from its point of chosen focus, it lightens its own sphere; know toothat light ascends and leaves in darkness that which it—in time andspace—illumined. This descending and ascension men call life, existence anddecease; this We Who tread the Lighted Way call death, experience and life.Light which descends anchors itself upon the plane of temporary appearance.Seven threads it outward puts, and seven rays of light pulsate along thesethreads. Twenty one lesser threads are radiated thence, causing the forty-ninefires to glow and burn. Upon the plane of manifested life, the word goes forth:Behold! A man is born.As life proceeds, the quality of light appears; dim and murky it may be, orradiant, bright and shining. Thus do the points of light within the [469] Flamepass and repass; they come and go. This men call life; they call it trueexistence. They thus delude themselves yet serve the purpose of their souls andfit into the greater Plan.And then a Word sounds forth. The descended, radiating point of light ascends,responsive to the dimly heard recalling note, attracted to its emanating source.This man calls death and this the soul calls life.The Word retains the light in life; the Word abstracts the light, and only Thatis left which is the Word Itself. That Word is Light. That Light is Life, andLife is God.The manifestation of the etheric body in time and space has in it what has beenesoterically called “two moments of brilliance.” These are, first, the momentprior to physical incarnation, when the descending light (carrying life) isfocussed in all its intensity around the physical body and sets up a rapportwith the innate light of matter itself, to be found in every atom of substance.This focussing light will be found to concentrate itself in seven areas of itsring-pass-not, thus creating seven major centres which will control itsexpression and its existence upon the outer plane, esoterically speaking. Thisis a moment of great radiance; it is almost as if a point of pulsating lightburst into flame, and as if within that flame seven points of intensified lighttook shape. This is a high point in the experience of taking incarnation, andprecedes physical birth by a very short period of time. It is that which bringson the birth hour. The next phase of the process, as seen by the clairvoyant, isthe stage of interpenetration, during which “the seven become the twenty-one andthen the many”; the light substance, the energy aspect of the soul, begins topermeate [470] the physical body, and the creative work of the etheric or vitalbody is completed. The first recognition of this upon the physical plane is the“sound” uttered by the newborn infant. It climaxes the process. The act ofcreation by the soul is now complete; a new light shines forth in a dark place.The second moment of brilliance comes in reverse of this process and heralds theperiod of restitution and the final abstraction of its own intrinsic energy bythe soul. The prison house of the flesh is dissolved by the withdrawing of thelight and life. The forty-nine fires within the physical organism die down;their heat and light are absorbed into the twenty-one minor points of light;these, in their turn, are absorbed by the major seven centres of energy. Thenthe “Word of Return” is uttered, and the consciousness aspect, the qualitynature, the light and energy of the incarnating man, are withdrawn into theetheric body. The life principle withdraws, likewise, from the heart. Therefollows a brilliant flaring-up of pure electric light, and the “body of light”finally breaks all contact with the dense physical vehicle, focusses for a shortperiod in the vital body, and then disappears. The act of restitution isaccomplished. This entire process of the focussing of the spiritual elements inthe etheric body, with the subsequent abstraction and consequent dissipation ofthe etheric body, would be greatly hastened by the substitution of cremation forburial.Two Main Reasons for CremationOccultly speaking, cremation is needed for two main reasons. It hastens therelease of the subtle vehicles (still enshrouding the soul) from the ethericbody, thus bringing about the release in a few hours instead of a few days; italso is a much needed means for bringing about the purification [471] of theastral plane and for arresting the “downward moving” tendency of desire which sogreatly handicaps the incarnating soul. It can find no point of focus, becauseessentially fire repels the form-making aspect of desire and is a majorexpression of divinity with which the astral plane has no true relation, beingcreated entirely by the human soul and not the divine soul. “Our God is aconsuming fire” is the statement in the Bible which refers to the first divineaspect, the aspect of the destroyer, releasing the life. “God is love” connotesthe second aspect and portrays God as incarnated existence. “God is a jealousGod” is an expression indicating God as form, circumscribed and limited,self-centered and not outgoing. The destroying Sound; the attracting Word; theindividualised Speech!At the time of death, speech fades out as the Word sounds forth and restitutionis enforced; later, the Word is no longer heard as the Sound obliterates orabsorbs it, and there is then complete elimination of all that interferes withSound. Silence then supervenes and the Sound itself is no longer heard; completepeace follows the act of final integration. Here, in esoteric phraseology, theentire process of death is described.It is important to note that it is under the basic and fundamental Law ofAttraction that the Art of Dying is carried forward, and that it is the loveaspect, the second aspect of divinity, which does the attracting. I excludecases of sudden death. There the activity is the result of the destroyer, or thefirst divine aspect. There the condition is different; individual karmicnecessity may not be involved at all, and reasons of group conditioning and ofgreat obscurity may lie behind such a happening. So obscure is the subject atthis time that I shall not attempt to elucidate. You do not know enough aboutthe Law of [472] Karma, about karmic group involvement, or about relationshipsand obligations established in past lives. When I say, for instance, that onoccasion the “soul may leave the door of protection open so that the forces ofdeath itself may enter anew, having no focal point behind the door” in order“more rapidly to obliterate past penalties due,” you can see how obscure thiswhole matter can be.In all that I am here writing, I am dealing simply with normal deathprocesses—death which comes as the result of disease, old age, or the imposedwill of the soul which has completed a designed cycle of experience and is usingnormal channels to attain projected ends. Death in these cases is normal, andthis humanity needs to grasp with greater patience, understanding and hope.Under the Law of Attraction, the soul, at the close of a life cycle, and withfull intention, exerts its attractive power in such a manner that it offsets theattractive power inherent in matter itself. This is a clear definition of thebasic cause of death. Where no soul contact has been consciously established, asin the case of the majority of people at this time, death comes as an unexpectedor sadly anticipated event. Yet—it is a true soul activity. This is the firstgreat spiritual concept to be proclaimed as the fear of death is combatted.Death is carried forward under this Law of Attraction, and consists in thesteady and scientific abstraction of the vital body out of the dense physicalbody, leading eventually to an elimination of all soul contact in the threeworlds.Sequence of Events at DeathI feel that the best that I can do, in order to clarify this subject morecompletely, is to describe the sequence of events which happens at a death bed,reminding you that the points of final abstraction are three in number: [473]the head for disciples and initiates and also for advanced mental types; theheart for aspirants, for men of goodwill, and for all those who have achieved ameasure of personality integrity and are attempting to fulfill, as far as inthem lies, the law of love; and the solar plexus for the undeveloped andemotionally polarised persons. All I can do is to tabulate the stages of theprocess, leaving you to accept them as an interesting and possible hypothesisawaiting verification; to believe them unquestioningly because you haveconfidence in my knowledge, or to reject them as fantastic, unverifiable and ofno moment anyway. I recommend the first of the three, for it will enable you topreserve your mental integrity, it will indicate an open mind, and at the sametime it will protect you from gullibility and from narrow-mindedness. Thesestages, therefore, are:1. The soul sounds forth a “word of withdrawal” from its own plane, andimmediately an interior process and reaction is evoked within the man upon thephysical plane.a. Certain physiological events take place at the seat of the disease, inconnection with the heart, and affecting also the three great systems which sopotently condition the physical man: the blood stream, the nervous system in itsvarious expressions, and the endocrine system. With these effects I shall notdeal. The pathology of death is well known and has received much studyexoterically; much still remains to be discovered and will later be discovered.I am concerned, first of all, with the subjective reactions which (in the lastanalysis) bring about the pathological predisposition to death.b. A vibration runs along the nadis . The nadis are, as you well know, theetheric counterpart of the [474] entire nervous system, and they underlie everysingle nerve in the entire physical body. They are the agents par excellence ofthe directing impulses of the soul, reacting to the vibratory activity whichemanates from the etheric counterpart of the brain. They respond to thedirecting Word, react to the “pull” of the soul, and then organise themselvesfor abstraction.c. The blood stream becomes affected in a peculiarly occult manner. The “bloodis the life,” we are told; it is interiorly changed as a result of the twoprevious stages, but primarily as the result of an activity hithertoundiscovered by modern science, for which the glandular system is responsible.The glands, in response to the call of death, inject into the blood stream asubstance which in turn affects the heart. There the life thread is anchored,and the substance in the blood is regarded as “death dealing” and is one of thebasic causes of coma and of loss of consciousness. It evokes a reflex action inthe brain. This substance and its effect will be questioned as yet by orthodoxmedicine, but its presence will later be recognised.d. A psychic tremor is established which has the effect of loosening or breakingthe connection between the nadis and the nervous system; the etheric body isthereby detached from its dense sheath, though still interpenetrating every partof it.2. There is frequently a pause at this point of a shorter or longer period oftime. This is allowed in order to carry forward the loosening process assmoothly and as painlessly as possible. This loosening of the nadis starts inthe eyes. This process of detachment often shows itself in the relaxation andlack of fear which [475] dying persons so often show; they evidence a conditionof peace, and a willingness to go, plus an inability to make a mental effort. Itis as if the dying person, still preserving his consciousness, gathers hisresources together for the final abstraction. This is the stage in which—thefear of death once and for all removed from the racial mind—the friends andrelatives of the departing person will “make a festival” for him and willrejoice with him because he is relinquishing the body. At present this is notpossible. Distress rules, and the stage passes unrecognised and is not utilised,as it will some day be.3. Next, the organised etheric body, loosened from all nervous relationshipthrough the action of the nadis, begins to gather itself together for the finaldeparture. It withdraws from the extremities towards the required “door of exit”and focusses itself in the area around that door for the final “pull” of thedirecting soul. All has been proceeding under the Law of Attraction up to thispoint—the magnetic, attractive will of the soul. Now another “pull” orattractive impulse makes itself felt. The dense physical body, the sumtotal oforgans, cells and atoms, is steadily being released from the integrating potencyof the vital body by the action of the nadis; it begins to respond to theattractive pull of matter itself. This has been called the “earth” pull and isexerted by that mysterious entity whom we call the “spirit of the earth”; thisentity is on the involutionary arc, and is to our planet what the physicalelemental is to the physical body of man. This physical plane life force isessentially the life and light of atomic substance—the matter of which all formsare made. It is to this reservoir of involutionary and material life that thesubstance of all forms is restored. Restitution of [476] the commandeered matterof the form occupied by the soul during a life cycle consists in returning tothis “Caesar” the involutionary world what is his, whilst the soul returns tothe God Who sent it forth.It will therefore be apparent that a dual attractive process is at this stagegoing on:a. The vital body is being prepared for exit.b. The physical body is responding to dissolution.It might be added that a third activity is also present. It is that of theconscious man, withdrawing his consciousness, steadily and gradually, into theastral and mental vehicles, preparatory to the complete abstraction of theetheric body when the right time comes. The man is becoming less and lessattached to the physical plane and more withdrawn within himself. In the case ofan advanced person, this process is consciously undertaken, and the man retainshis vital interests and his awareness of relationship to others even whilstlosing his grip on physical existence. In old age this detachment can be moreeasily noted than in death through disease, and frequently the soul or theliving, interested, inner man can be seen losing his grip on physical and,therefore, illusory reality.4. Again a pause ensues . This is the point where the physical elemental can attimes regain its hold upon the etheric body, if that is deemed desirable by thesoul, if death is not part of the inner plan, or if the physical elemental is sopowerful that it can prolong the process of dying. This elemental life willsometimes fight a battle lasting for days and weeks. When, however, death isinevitable, the pause at this point will be exceedingly brief, sometimes onlyfor a matter of seconds. The physical elemental has lost its hold, and theetheric [477] body awaits the final “tug” from the soul, acting under the Law ofAttraction.5. The etheric body emerges from the dense physical body in gradual stages andat the chosen point of exit. When this emergence is complete, the vital bodythen assumes the vague outline of the form that it energised, and this under theinfluence of the thoughtform of himself which the man has built up over theyears. This thoughtform exists in the case of every human being, and must bedestroyed before the second stage of elimination is finally complete. We willtouch upon this later. Though freed from the prison of the physical body, theetheric body is not yet freed from its influence. There is still a slightrapport between the two, and this keeps the spiritual man still close to thebody just vacated. That is why clairvoyants often claim to see the etheric bodyhovering around the death bed or the coffin. Still interpenetrating the ethericbody are the integrated energies which we call the astral body and the mentalvehicle, and at the centre there is a point of light which indicates thepresence of the soul.6. The etheric body is gradually dispersed as the energies of which it iscomposed are reorganised and withdrawn, leaving only the pranic substance whichis identified with the etheric vehicle of the planet itself. This process ofdispersal is, as I have earlier said, greatly aided by cremation. In the case ofthe undeveloped person, the etheric body can linger for a long time in theneighbourhood of its outer disintegrating shell because the pull of the soul isnot potent and the material aspect is. Where the person is advanced, andtherefore detached in his thinking from the physical plane, the dissolution ofthe vital body can be exceedingly rapid. Once it is accomplished, the process ofrestitution is over; the man [478] is freed, temporarily at least, from allreaction to the attractive pull of physical matter; he stands in his subtlebodies, ready for the great act to which I have given the name “The Art ofElimination.”One thought emerges as we conclude this inadequate consideration of the death ofthe physical body in its two aspects: that thought is the integrity of the innerman. He remains himself. He is untouched and untrammelled: he is a free agent asfar as the physical plane is concerned, and is responsive now to only threepredisposing factors:1. The quality of his astral-emotional equipment.2. The mental condition in which he habitually lives.3. The voice of the soul, often unfamiliar but sometimes well known and loved.Individuality is not lost; the same person is still present upon the planet.Only that has disappeared which was an integral part of the tangible appearanceof our planet. That which has been loved or hated, which has been useful tohumanity or a liability, which has served the race or been an ineffectual memberof it, still persists, is still in touch with the qualitative and mentalprocesses of existence, and will forever remain—individual, qualified by raytype, part of the kingdom of souls, and a high initiate in his own right.3. TWO QUESTIONS OF IMPORTANCE.I have sought, in the preceding pages, to give an insight into the true natureof that which we call death. Death is the withdrawal, consciously orunconsciously, of the inner living entity from its outer shell, its inner vitalcorrespondence, and finally it is the relinquishing of the subtle body orbodies, according to the point in evolution of the person. I have also sought toshow the normality of this familiar [479] process. The horror which attendsdeath upon the battlefield or by accident consists in the shock which itprecipitates within the area of the etheric body, necessitating a rapidrearrangement of its constituent forces and a sudden and unexpectedreintegration of its component parts in response to definite action which hasperforce to be taken by the man in his kama-manasic body. This action does notinvolve the replacing of the inner man again within the etheric vehicle, butrequires a coming together of the dissipated aspects of that body under the Lawof Attraction, in order that its final and complete dissolution can take place.Before taking up our theme (which is the Art of Elimination), I want to answertwo questions which seem to me of importance; they are frequently asked byearnest and intelligent students.The first question is, in reality, the expression of disappointment in thisseries of instructions. It can be framed as follows: Why does not the TibetanTeacher take up definite or basic diseases, and deal with their pathology, givetheir cures or suggested treatment, indicate their direct causes and give, indetail, the processes of recovery? Because, my brothers, there is little that Ican add technically to what has already been ascertained by medical scienceanent the symptoms, the localities and the general trends in which diseasedconditions are found. Observation, experimentation, trial and error, success andfailure have given to modern man a wide and definitely accurate knowledge of theouter aspects and effects of disease. Time, and constant trained observation,have equally definitely indicated cures or ameliorative processes or preventivemeasures (such as vaccination for smallpox), and these have proved after manyyears to be helpful. Investigation and experiment and the steadily growingfacilities which science provides are adding to man’s capacity to help, to cureat times, to ameliorate frequently, [480] and to lessen the reactions of pain.Medical science and surgical skill have advanced by leaps and bounds—so much sothat what is today known and somewhat grasped is of so vast a nature and sointricate in its scientific and therapeutic aspects that they have given rise tospecialists—to those who concentrate upon a particular field, and who thereforedeal only with certain conditions of ill health and disease, thereby attainingmuch skill, knowledge and frequent success. All this is good, in spite of whatcranks and people with a pet method of cure may say, or even those who have nouse for the medical profession and prefer some cult or some of the newerapproaches to the problem of health.The reason that these newer approaches exist is that medical science has madesuch progress that it has now reached the limits of its purely physical area orfield and is now on the verge of advancing into the realm of the intangible andis thus drawing nearer to the world of causes. It is for this reason that I havewasted no time with the details of disease, with enumerating or consideringspecific diseases, their symptoms or their treatment because that is fullycovered in the textbooks available; they can likewise be seen in their many andvarious stages in our great hospitals.I have, however, dealt with the latent causes of disease—such as tuberculosis,syphilis and cancer—inherent in the individual man, in humanity as a whole, andalso in our planet. I have traced the psychological basis of disease and haveindicated a practically new field wherein disease—particularly in its earlierstages—can be studied.When the psychological basis of disease can be realised and its factual natureis admitted by the orthodox physician, the surgeon, the psychologist and thepriest, then all will work together in this developing area of understanding,and what is today vaguely called “preventive medicine” will come into its own. Iprefer to define this phase of medical [481] application as the organisation ofthose methods whereby disease will be avoided, and the development of thosetechniques whereby correct psychological training will be given—from youthup—and by right emphasis upon the inner spiritual man, those conditions will benegated and those habits avoided which today lead inevitably to ill health,definitely symptomatic disease and eventual death.In the above statement, I refer to no affirmative or speculative science such asChristian Science or those schools of thought which trace all disease to thepower of thought. I am concerned with the immediate necessity of rightpsychological training, based upon a knowledge of the constitution of man, uponthe science of the seven rays (the forces which condition man and make him whathe is), and upon esoteric astrology; I am concerned with the application of theknowledges, hitherto regarded as peculiar and esoteric, which are slowly comingunder general consideration, and which have made great progress during the pasttwenty-five years. I am not concerned with the abolition of medical treatment,nor am I concerned with endorsing the newer modes of treatment—all of which arestill in the experimental stage and all of which have somewhat to contribute tomedical science as a whole; out of the united contribution should come a richerand more fluid medical approach to the patient.The picture I have outlined of the psychological background of all diseases willbe long in painting; in the meantime, the contribution of medicine isindispensable. In spite of mistakes, faulty diagnosis and much error, humanitycannot do without its doctors, its surgeons and its hospitals. They are urgentlyneeded, and will be for centuries to come. In this statement is no cause fordiscouragement. Humanity cannot be brought into a condition of perfect physicalhealth immediately, though correct psychological training from infancy will domuch in the course of a few decades. Wrong [482] conditions have been longdeveloping. Modern medicine must become far more open-minded, more ready toendorse (after due professional proof) that which is new, which is in the natureof innovation and which is unusual. The barriers erected by specialised medicinemust come down, and the new schools must be sought, instructed and investigated,and finally be included in the orthodox ranks. The new schools, such as thoseconcerned with electro-therapy, the chiropractic schools, the dieticians whoclaim to cure all diseases through right foods, and the rather eccentricnaturopaths, plus many other cults and schools, must not be so arrogantly surethat they have the whole story, that their approach is the only one or that theyhave a universal cure-all which is unique and definitely sure. These groups,particularly the chiropractors, have definitely damaged their cause and crippledtheir effort by their loudly shouted surety (in a field which is yetexperimental), and by their constant attack upon orthodox medicine. The latter,in its turn, has limited itself by its failure to recognise what is good andright in the newer schools; it has been antagonised by their clamour forrecognition, and by their lack of scientific methods. The desire of orthodoxmedicine is to protect the general public. This they needs must do in order toavoid the disasters which fanatics and untried methods would bring about, butthey have gone too far in this respect. The school of thought which I havesponsored in these instructions will also be challenged, and this for a longtime. However, the mental and psychological effects of the world war willgreatly hasten the recognition of the psychological basis for disease and othertroubles; modern medicine, therefore, faces its major opportunity.A combination of true medical science (as produced by man down the ages underthe inspiration of his divine nature), of the newer aspects of treatment asformulated by [483] the many emerging schools of thought, of practice andexperiment, the recognition of the energies which condition man, working throughthe seven centres in his vital body, and of the astrological influences whichequally condition him, via the inner man , will eventually produce the newmedical approach which will keep man in good health, which will arrest diseasein its earliest stages, and which will finally inaugurate that cycle in humanaffairs wherein disease and ill health will be exceptions and not the rule, asis the case today, and wherein death will be regarded as a happy and destinedrelease and not, as is the case today, a dreaded enemy.The second question is definitely concerned with the processes of death. It hasbeen asked: What is the Tibetan’s attitude towards cremation, and under whatconditions should cremation be followed? It is a fortunate and happy thing thatcremation is becoming increasingly the rule. Before so very long, burial in theground will be against the law and cremation will be enforced, and this as ahealth and sanitation measure. Those unhealthy, psychic spots, calledcemeteries, will eventually disappear, just as ancestor worship is passing out,both in the Orient—with its ancestor cults—and in the Occident—with its equallyfoolish cult of hereditary position.By the use of fire, all forms are dissolved; the quicker the human physicalvehicle is destroyed, the quicker is its hold upon the withdrawing soul broken.A great deal of nonsense has been told in current theosophical literature aboutthe time equation in relation to the sequential destruction of the subtlebodies. It should be stated, however, that the moment that true death isscientifically established (by the orthodox doctor in charge of the case), andit has been ascertained that no spark of life remains in the physical body,cremation is then possible. This complete or true [484] death eventuates whenthe thread of consciousness and the thread of life are completely withdrawn fromthe head and the heart. At the same time, reverence and an unhurried attitudehave their rightful place in the process. The family of the dead person need afew hours in which to adjust themselves to the fact of the imminentdisappearance of the outer and usually loved form; due care must also be givento the formalities required by the state or the municipality. This time elementhas reference mainly to those who are left behind, to the living and not to thedead. The claim that the etheric body must not be rushed into the crematingflames, and the belief that it must be left to drift around for a stated periodof several days, have also no true basis at all. There is no etheric need fordelay. When the inner man withdraws from his physical vehicle he withdrawssimultaneously from the etheric body. It is true that the etheric body is apt tolinger for a long time on the “field of emanation” when the physical body isinterred, and it will frequently persist until complete disintegration of thedense body has taken place. The process of mummifying, as practised in Egypt,and of embalming, as practised in the West, have been responsible for theperpetuation of the etheric body, sometimes for centuries. This is particularlythe case when the mummy or embalmed person was of an evil character during life;the hovering etheric body is then often “possessed” by an evil entity or evilforce. This is the cause of the attacks and the disasters which often dog thesteps of those who discover ancient tombs and their inhabitants, ancientmummies, and bring them and their possessions to light. Where cremation is therule, there is not only the immediate destruction of the physical body and itsrestitution to the fount of substance, but the vital body is also promptlydissolved and its forces swept away by the current of flame into the reservoirof vital energies. Of that reservoir [485] it has ever been an inherent part,either in form or in a formless condition. After death and cremation theseforces still exist but are absorbed into the analogous whole. Ponder on thisstatement, for it will give you the clue to the creative work of the humanspirit. If delay is necessary from family feeling or municipal requirements,cremation should follow death within thirty-six hours; where no reason for delayexists, cremation can be rightly permitted in twelve hours. It is wise, however,to wait twelve hours in order to ensure true death."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI - THE ART OF ELIMINATION[486] To take up again the thread of our instruction, we will now consider theactivity of the inner spiritual man who has discarded his physical and ethericbodies and now stands within the shell of the subtle body—a body composed ofastral or sentient substance and of mental substance. Owing to the stronglyemotional and sentient polarisation of the average man, the idea has taken holdthat man withdraws, after true death, first of all into his astral body, andthen, later, into his mental vehicle. But this is not actually the case. A bodyconstructed predominantly of astral matter is the basis of this idea. Few peopleare as yet so developed that the vehicle in which they find themselves afterdeath is largely composed of mental substance. Only disciples and initiates wholive mostly in their minds find themselves, after death, immediately upon themental plane. Most people discover themselves upon the astral plane, clothed ina shell of astral matter and committed to a period of elimination within theillusory area of the astral plane.As I have earlier told you, the astral plane has no factual existence, but is anillusory creation of the human family. From now on, however (through the defeatof the forces of evil and the disastrous setback suffered by the Black Lodge),the astral plane will slowly become a dying creation, [487] and in the finalperiod of human history (in the seventh rootrace), it will become nonexistent.Today this is not the case. The sentient substance which constitutes the astralplane is still being gathered into forms of illusion and still forms a barrierin the path of the soul seeking liberation. It still “holds prisoner” the manypeople who die whilst their major reaction to life is that of desire, of wishfulthinking and of emotional sentiency. These are still the vast majority. InAtlantean days the astral plane came into being; the mental state ofconsciousness was then practically nonexistent, though the “sons of mind” hadtheir place on what is today the higher levels of that plane. The mentalpermanent atom was also practically quiescent within each human form, and therewas consequently no attractive “pull” from the mental plane, as is the casetoday. Many people are still Atlantean in consciousness, and when they pass outof the physical state of consciousness and discard their dual physical body,they are faced with the problem of elimination of the astral body, but they havelittle to do to release themselves from any mental prison of the soul. These arethe undeveloped and average persons who, after the elimination of the kamic ordesire body, have little else to do; there is no mental vehicle to draw theminto a mental integration because there is no mentally focussed potency; thesoul on the higher mental levels is as yet “in deep meditation” and quiteunaware of its shadow in the three worlds.The art of elimination falls, therefore, into three categories:1. As practised by those people who are purely astral in quality andconstitution. These we call “kamic” people.2. As practised by those balanced people who are integrated personalities andwho are called “kama-manasic” [488] individuals.3. As practised by advanced people and disciples of all grades who are mainlymental in their “living focus.” These are called “manasic” subjects.The same basic rules control them all, but the emphasis differs in each case. Iwould have you bear in mind that where there is no physical brain and where themind is undeveloped, the inner man finds himself practically smothered in anenvelope of astral matter and is for a long time immersed in what we call theastral plane. The kama-manasic person has what is called the “freedom of thedual life,” and finds himself possessed of a dual form which enables him tocontact at will the higher levels of the astral plane and the lower levels ofthe mental plane. I would again remind you that there is no physical brain toregister these contacts. Awareness of contact is dependent upon the innateactivity of the inner man and his peculiar state of apprehension and ofappreciation. The manasic person is possessed of a translucent mental vehiclewith a light density which is in proportion to his freedom from desire andemotion.These three types of people all use an eliminative process of a similar nature,but employ a different technique within the process. For the sake of clarity, itmight be stated that:1. The kamic person eliminates his astral body by means of attrition, andvacates it via the astral correspondence to the solar plexus centre. Thisattrition is brought about because all the innate desire and inherent emotionare, at this stage, related to the animal nature and the physical body—both ofwhich are now nonexistent.2. The kama-manasic individual uses two techniques. This would naturally be sobecause he eliminates, first of all, his astral body, and then his mentalvehicle. [489]a. He eliminates the astral body by means of his growing desire for mental life.He withdraws gradually and steadily into the mind body, and the astral bodyesoterically “drops away” and finally disappears. This takes place usuallyunconsciously and may require quite a long time. Where, however, the man isabove the average, and on the verge of becoming a manasic person, thedisappearance is brought about suddenly and dynamically, and the man stands freein his mental body. This takes place consciously and rapidly.b. He shatters the mental body by an act of the human will, and also because thesoul is beginning to be slowly aware of its shadow. The inner man is thereforeattracted towards the soul, though still only in a somewhat feeble manner. Thisprocess is relatively quick and is dependent upon the extent of the manasicinfluence.3. The manasic man , focussed now in his mental body, has also two things toaccomplish:a. To dissolve and rid himself of any astral sediment which may be discolouringhis translucent mental body. The so-called astral body is now practicallynonexistent as a factor of expression. This he does by calling in increasedlight from the soul. It is soul light which, at this stage, dissolves the astralsubstance, just as it will be the combined light of the soul of humanity (as awhole) which will dissolve finally the astral plane—again so-called.b. To destroy the mental body through the use of certain Words of Power. TheseWords are communicated to the disciple via the Ashram of his Master. They bringin soul power to a greatly enhanced extent, and produce consequently such an[490] expansion of consciousness within the mental body that is broken up and nolonger constitutes a barrier to the inner man. He can now stand, a free son ofmind, within the Ashram of his Master and “shall no more go out”.ACTIVITIES IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEATHImmediately after death, and particularly if cremation has taken place, the man,in his kama-manasic body, is as much aware and alert to his environment as hewas upon the physical plane when alive. This phrasing permits latitude as to theextent of the awareness and of observation, for a similar latitude must beallowed for those on the physical plane. People are not all equally awake orequally conscious of circumstances or immediate experience. However, as mostpeople are more conscious emotionally than they are physically, and live to agreat extent focussed in their astral vehicles, the man is quite familiar withthe state of consciousness in which he finds himself. Forget not that a plane isessentially a state of consciousness and not a locality, as so many esotericistsseem to think. It is recognised by the focussed reaction of the self-consciousperson who—constantly and distinctly aware of himself—is sentient to the themeof his environment and of his outgoing desires, or (where advanced people areconcerned, functioning upon the more advanced levels of the astral plane)sentient of outgoing love and aspiration; the man is engrossed with whatengrossed his attention and involved the kamic principle during his incarnatedexperience. May I again remind you that there is now no physical brain torespond to impacts generated by the inner man, and also that sex, as it isphysically understood, is nonexistent. Spiritualists would do well to rememberthis and so grasp the foolishness as well as the impossibility of thosespiritual [491] marriages which certain schools of thought in the movement teachand practice. The man, in his astral body, is now free from the strictly animalimpulses which, upon the physical plane, are both normal and right, but whichnow have no meaning to him in his kamic body.Therefore, taking the average man, what are his first reactions and activitiesafter the restitution of the physical body to the universal reservoir ofsubstance? Let me enumerate some of these reactions:1. He becomes consciously aware of himself. This involves a clarity ofperception unknown to the average man whilst in physical incarnation.2. Time (being the succession of events as registered by the physical brain) isnow nonexistent as we understand the term, and—as the man turns his attention tohis more clearly defined emotional self—there ensues invariably a moment ofdirect soul contact. This is due to the fact that even in the case of the mostignorant and undeveloped man, the moment of complete restitution does not passunnoticed by the soul. It has a definite soul effect, something like a long andstrong pull at a bell rope, if I might use so simple a simile. For a briefsecond the soul responds, and the nature of the response is such that the man,standing in his astral body, or rather in his kama-manasic vehicle, sees theexperience of the past incarnation spread before him like a map. He records asense of timelessness.3. As a result of the recognition of these experiences, the man isolates thosethree which were the three major conditioning factors in the life which has goneand which also hold the keys to his future incarnation which he will nextinitiate. All else is forgotten, and all the lesser experiences fade out of hismemory, leaving nothing in [492] his consciousness but what are esotericallycalled “the three seeds or germs of the future”. These three seeds are in apeculiar manner related to the permanent physical and astral atoms, and thusproduce the fivefold force which will create the forms later to appear. It mightbe said that:a. Seed One determines later the nature of the physical environment in which thereturning man will find his place. It is related to the quality of that futureenvironment and thus conditions the needed field or area of contact.b. Seed Two determines the quality of the etheric body as a vehicle throughwhich the ray forces can make contact with the dense physical body. It delimitsthe etheric structure or vital web along which the incoming energies willcirculate and is related in particular to the special one of the seven centreswhich will be the most active and alive during the coming incarnation.c. Seed Three gives the key to the astral vehicle in which the man will bepolarised in the next incarnation. Forget not, I am dealing here with theaverage man and not with the advanced human being, disciple or initiate. It isthis seed which—through the forces it attracts—brings the man again intorelation with those he previously loved or with whom he had close contact. Itcan be accepted as a fact that the group idea governs subjectively allincarnations, and that reincarnated man is brought into incarnation not onlythrough his own desire for physical plane experience, but also under groupimpulse and in line with the group karma as well as with his own. This is apoint which should receive more emphasis. Once this is truly grasped andunderstood, a great deal of the [493] fear engendered by the thought of deathwould disappear. The familiar and the loved will still remain the familiar andthe loved, because the relation has been closely established over manyincarnations and—as the Old Commentary expresses it:“These seeds of determining recognition are not unique to me and you, but alsofor the group; within the group they relate one to the other in time and space.Only in the lower three shall those related find their true existence. When soulknows soul and in the meeting-place within the Master’s call, these seeds shalldisappear.”It will be apparent, therefore, how necessary it is to train children torecognise and profit by experience, for this, once learnt, will greatlyfacilitate this third activity upon the astral plane after death.4. Having completed this “isolating of experience,” the man will then seek andautomatically find those whom the third seed influence indicates as possessing aconstant part in the group experience of which he is an element, consciously orunconsciously. The relation once again established (if those sought have not yeteliminated the physical body), the man acts as he would on earth in the companyof his intimates and according to his temperament and point in evolution. Ifthose who are closest to him and whom he deeply loves or hates are still inphysical incarnation, he will also seek them out and—just again as he did onearth—he will remain in their neighbourhood, aware of their activities, though(unless highly evolved) they will not be aware of his. I can give no detail asto reciprocal give and take or to the modes and methods of contact. Each persondiffers; each temperament is largely unique. I only seek to make [494] clearcertain basic lines of behaviour pursued by man prior to the act or acts ofelimination.These four activities cover varying periods of time—from the angle of “those wholive below,” though there is no time recognised on the part of the man on theastral plane. Gradually the lure and glamour (of a low or high order) wears off,and the man enters into the stage where he knows —because the mind is now moreincisive and dominating—that he is ready for the second death and for the entireelimination of the kamic body or of the kama-manasic vehicle.One of the things to remember here is that once restitution of the physical inits two aspects has taken place, the inner man is, as I have earlier said, fullyconscious. The physical brain and the swirl of etheric forces (mostly somewhatdisorganized in the case of the majority of men) are no longer present. Theseare the two factors which have led students to believe that the experiences ofthe man on the inner planes of the three worlds are those of a vague drifting,of a semi-conscious experience, or indicate a repetitive life, except in thecase of very advanced people or disciples and initiates. But this is not thecase. A man on the inner planes is not only as conscious of himself as anindividual—with his own plans, life and affairs—as he was on the physical plane,but he is also conscious in the same manner of the surrounding states ofconsciousness. He may be glamoured by astral existence or subject to thetelepathic impression of the varying thought currents emanating from the mentalplane, but he is also conscious of himself and of his mind (or of the measure ofmanasic life developed) in a far more potent manner than when he had to workthrough the medium of the physical brain, when the focus of his consciousnesswas that of the aspirant, but anchored in the [495] brain. His experience is farricher and fuller than he ever knew when in incarnation. If you will think thisout for a little, you will realise that this necessarily would be so.It may therefore be assumed that the Art of Elimination is practised moredefinitely and more effectively than was the restitution of the physicalvehicle. Another point must also be considered. On the inner side, men know thatthe Law of Rebirth governs the experience-process of physical plane living, andthey realise then that, prior to the elimination of the kamic, kama-manasic ormanasic bodies, they are only passing through an interlude between incarnationsand that they consequently face two great experiences:1. A moment (long or short, according to the attained point in evolution)wherein contact will be made with the soul or with the solar angel.2. After that a contact, a relatively violent reorientation to earth life takesplace, leading to what is called “the process of descent and calling,” whereinthe man:a. Prepares for physical incarnation again.b. Sounds his own true note into the substance of the three worlds.c. Revitalises the permanent atoms, which form a triangle of force within thecausal body.d. Gathers together the needed substance to form his future bodies ofmanifestation.e. Colours them with the qualities and characteristics he has already achievedthrough life-experience.f. On the etheric plane arranges the substance of his vital body so that theseven centres take shape and can become the recipients of the inner forces.g. Makes a deliberate choice of those who will provide him with the needed densephysical covering, and then awaits the moment of incarnation. Esoteric [496]students would do well to remember that parents only donate the dense physicalbody. They contribute naught else save a body of a particular quality and naturewhich will provide the needed vehicle of contact with the environment demandedby the incarnating soul. They may also provide a measure of group relationship,where the soul experience is long and a true group relation has beenestablished.These two critical moments are consciously faced by the discarnate man and heknows what he is doing within the limits set by his point in evolution.THE DEVACHAN EXPERIENCEI would also point out that this conscious undertaking of the art ofelimination, and this awareness of process and purpose, in reality constitutethe state of consciousness which has been called devachan by the orthodoxtheosophist. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding of this experience.The general idea has been that, after the process of ridding himself of theastral and mental bodies, the man enters into a sort of dream state wherein hereexperiences and reconsiders past events in the light of the future andundergoes a sort of rest period, a kind of digestive process, in preparation forthe undertaking of renewed birth. This somewhat erroneous idea has arisenbecause the concept of time still governs theosophical presentations of truth.If, however, it is realised that time is not known apart from physical planeexperience, the entire concept of devachan clarifies. From the moment ofcomplete separation from the dense physical and etheric bodies, and as theeliminative process is undertaken, the man is aware of past and present ; whenelimination is complete and the hour of [497] soul contact eventuates and themanasic vehicle is in process of destruction, he becomes immediately aware ofthe future , for prediction is an asset of the soul consciousness and in thisthe man temporarily shares. Therefore, past, present and future are seen as one;the recognition of the Eternal Now is gradually developed from incarnation toincarnation and during the continuous process of rebirth. This constitutes astate of consciousness (characteristic of the normal state of the advanced man)which can be called devachanic.It is not my intention to elaborate the technique of the eliminative process.Humanity is at so many different stages—intermediate between the three alreadyoutlined—that it would be impossible to be definite or concise. Attrition isrelatively easy to understand; the kamic body dies out because, there being nocall from physical substance, evoking desire, there is nothing with which tofeed this vehicle. The astral body comes into being through the reciprocalinterplay between the physical plane, which is not a principle, and theprinciple of desire; in the process of taking rebirth, this principle isutilised with dynamic intent by the soul in the mental vehicle to reverse thecall, and matter then responds to the call of the reincarnating man. Kamic man,after a long process of attrition, is left standing free within an embryonicmental vehicle, and this period of semi-mental life is exceedingly brief and isbrought to an end by the soul who suddenly “directs his eye to the waiting one,”and of the power of that directed potency instantaneously reorients theindividual kamic man to the downward path of rebirth. The kama-manasic manpractises a process of withdrawal and responds to the “pull” of a rapidlydeveloping mental body. This withdrawal becomes increasingly rapid and dynamicuntil it reaches the state where the probationary disciple—under steadilygrowing soul contact—shatters the kama-manasic body, as a unit, by an act of themental will, [498] implemented by the soul. You will note that the “devachanic”experience will necessarily be briefer in connection with this majority thanwith the kamic minority, because the devachanic technique of review andrecognition of the implications of experience is slowly controlling the man onthe physical plane so that he brings the significance of meaning and learnsconstantly through experience whilst incarnating. Thus you will realise alsothat continuity of consciousness is also being slowly developed, and theawarenesses of the inner man begin to demonstrate on the physical plane, throughthe medium of the physical brain at first, and then independently of thatmaterial structure. I have here conveyed a definite hint on a subject which willreceive wide attention during the next two hundred years.The manasic person, the integrated personality, works, as we have seen, in twoways which are necessarily dependent upon the integration achieved. Thisintegration will be of two kinds:1. That of the integrated personality focussed in the mind and achieving aconstantly growing rapport with the soul.2. The disciple, whose integrated personality is now being rapidly integratedinto and absorbed by the soul.In this stage of mind development and of constant mental control (based on thefact that the man’s consciousness is now definitely focussed and permanentlycentered in the mental vehicle), the earlier processes of the destruction of theastral body through attrition and by “dynamic negation” are carried on whilst inphysical incarnation. The incarnated man refuses to be ruled by desire; what isleft of the illusory astral body is dominated now by the mind, and the urgestowards the satisfaction of desire are refused with full and [499] consciousdeliberation, either because of the selfish ambitions and mental intentions ofthe integrated personality, or under the inspiration of soul intention whichsubordinates the mind to its purposes. When this point in evolution is attained,the man can then dissolve the last remaining vestiges of all desire by means ofillumination . In the early stages of purely manasic or mental life, this isdone through the illumination which knowledge brings and involves mainly theinnate light of mental substance. Later, when soul and mind are establishing aclose rapport, the light of the soul hastens and supplements the process. Thedisciple now uses more occult methods, but upon these I may not here enlarge.The destruction of the mental body is no longer brought about by the destructivepower of light itself, but is hastened by means of certain sounds, emanatingfrom the plane of the spiritual will; these are recognised by the disciple, andpermission to use them in their proper word-forms is given to him by some seniorinitiate within the Ashram or by the Master Himself, towards the close of thecycle of incarnation.TENTH LAW OF HEALINGI would like now to lay down certain postulates which we shall need to considerin our study of Part Three where we take up the Fundamental Laws of Healing.These Laws and Rules, I have already given you, but I seek now to elaborate.We have studied at some length the immediate processes which take place when theprinciple of life withdraws or is withdrawn from the body. There is adistinction, based on evolutionary development, in these two processes. We havetraced the withdrawal of the life principle, plus the consciousness, from thesubtle bodies in the three worlds, and have now reached the point where we areno longer dealing [500] with average man or with undeveloped man. We shall beconcerned with the conscious activity of the soul in relation to its formaspect.With the undeveloped or the average man, the soul plays a very small part in thedeath process, beyond the contribution of a simple soul determination to end thecycle of incarnated life, prior to another return to the physical plane. The“seeds of death” are inherent in the form nature and demonstrate as disease oras senility (using that word in its technical and not in its colloquial sense),and the soul pursues its own interests on its own plane until such time as theevolutionary process has brought about a situation wherein the integration orclose relation between soul and form is so real that the soul is deeply andprofoundly identified with its manifesting expression. It might be said thatwhen this stage is reached, the soul is, for the first time, truly incarnated;it is truly “descending into manifestation” and the entire soul nature isthereby involved. This is a point little emphasised or realised.In the earlier lives of the incarnating soul and for the majority of the cyclesof life experience, the soul is very slightly concerned in what is going on. Theredemption of the substance of which all forms are made goes forward undernatural process and the “karma of matter” is the initial governing force; thisis succeeded in time by the karma generated by the fusion of soul and form,though (in the earlier stages) very little responsibility is engendered by thesoul. That which occurs within the threefold soul-sheath is necessarily theresult of the innate tendencies of substance itself. However, as time goes onand incarnation follows upon incarnation, the effect of the indwelling soulquality gradually evokes conscience, and—through the medium of conscience, whichis the exercise of the discriminative sense, developed as the mind assumesincreasing control—an [501] awakening and finally an awakened consciousness isevoked. This demonstrates in the first instance as the sense of responsibility;it is this which gradually establishes a growing identification of the soul withits vehicle, the lower triple man. The bodies become then steadily more refined;the seeds of death and of disease are not so potent; sensitivity to inner soulrealisation grows until the time is reached when the initiate-disciple dies byan act of his spiritual will or in response to group karma or to national orplanetary karma.Disease and death are essentially conditions inherent in substance; just as longas a man identifies himself with the form aspect, so will he be conditioned bythe Law of Dissolution. This law is a fundamental and natural law governing thelife of the form in all the kingdoms of nature. When the disciple or theinitiate is identifying himself with the soul, and when the antahkarana is builtby means of the life principle, then the disciple passes out of the control ofthis universal, natural law and uses or discards the body at will—at the demandof the spiritual will or through recognition of the necessities of the Hierarchyor the purposes of Shamballa.We come now to the enunciation of a new law which is substituted for the Law ofDeath and which has reference only to those upon the later stages of the Path ofDiscipleship and the stages upon the Path of Initiation.LAW XHearken, O Chela, to the call which comes from the Son to the Mother, and thenobey. The Word goes forth that form has served its purpose. The principle ofmind (the fifth principle. A.A.B.) then organises itself, and then repeats theWord. The waiting form responds and drops away. The soul stands free. [502]Respond, O Rising One, to the call which comes within the sphere of obligation;recognize the call emerging from the Ashram or from the Council Chamber wherewaits the Lord of Life Himself. The Sound goes forth. Both soul and formtogether must renounce the principle of life and thus permit the Monad to standfree. The soul responds. The form then shatters the connection. Life is nowliberated, owning the quality of conscious knowledge and the fruit of allexperience. These are the gifts of soul and form combined.I have wished to make clear in your minds the distinction between disease anddeath as experienced by the average man, and certain corresponding processes ofconscious dissolution as practised by the advanced disciple or initiate. Theselater processes involve a slowly developing technique in which (in the earlierstages) the disciple is still the victim of disease-producing tendencies of theform, as of all forms in nature. This tendency produces subsequent death,through the stages of modified disease and peaceful, consequent death, on to theother stages where death is brought about by an act of the will—the time and themode being determined by the soul and consciously recorded and registered in thebrain. Pain is demonstrated in both cases, but upon the Path of Initiation painis largely negated, not because the initiate endeavours to avoid pain, butbecause the sensitivity of the form to undesirable contacts disappears, and withit pain also disappears; pain is the guardian of the form and the protector ofsubstance; it warns of danger; it indicates certain definite stages in theevolutionary process; it is related to the principle whereby the soul identifiesitself with substance. When the identification ceases, pain and disease and alsodeath lose their hold upon the disciple; the soul is no longer subject to theirrequirements, and the man is free because disease and death are qualitiesinherent in form, and subject to the vicissitudes of form life.[503] Death is to man exactly what the release of the atom appears to be; thisthe great scientific discovery of the release of atomic energy has demonstrated.The nucleus of the atom is split in two. (This wording is scientificallyincorrect.) This event in the life experience of the atom releases a great lightand a great potency; upon the astral plane, the phenomenon of death has asomewhat similar effect and has a close parallel in the phenomena brought aboutby the release of atomic energy. Every death, in all the kingdoms of nature, hasto some extent this effect; it shatters and destroys substantial form and thusserves a constructive purpose; this result is largely astral or psychic andserves to dissipate some of the enveloping glamour. The wholesale destruction offorms which has been going on during the past few years of war has producedphenomenal changes upon the astral plane and has shattered an immense amount ofthe existing world glamour, and this is very, very good. These happenings shouldresult in less opposition to the inflow of the new type of energy; it shouldfacilitate the appearance of the ideas embodying the needed recognitions; thenew concepts will now be seen, and their emergence into the realm of humanthinking will be dependent upon the formulation of the new “lanes or channels ofimpression” whereby the minds of men can become sensitive to hierarchical plansand to the purposes of Shamballa.This, however, is by the way. My proposition will serve to show you some of therelationships between death and constructive activity, and the wide usefulnessof death as a process in reconstruction. It will convey to you the idea thatthis great Law of Death—as it governs substance in the three worlds—is abeneficent and corrective event. Without enlarging upon it, I would remind youthat this Law of Death, which governs in such potency in the three worlds ofhuman evolution, is a reflection of a cosmic purpose which [504] governs thecosmic etheric planes of our solar system, the cosmic astral plane and thecosmic mental plane. The death-dealing energy emanates as an expression of thelife principle of that greater LIFE which enfolds all the seven planetarysystems which in Themselves express the Life of our solar system. When, in ourthinking and in our effort to understand, we enter this realm of pureabstraction, it is time to call a halt and draw our minds back to the morepractical ways of planetary living and to the laws governing the fourth kingdomin nature, the human.We are now in a position (after this attempt to argue from the universal to theparticular, which is ever the occult way), to take up, in Part Three, the lastpoint which deals with the Basic Requirements, and must now consider the use ofthe death principle by the disciple or the initiate. I would have you note myway of expressing this concept. This is dealt with under the title of TheProcesses of Integration."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII - THE PROCESSES OF INTEGRATION[505] In considering this intelligently utilised event as it is employed by thesoul, functioning consciously in the three worlds, we shall find it helpful toconsider it under two main headings:First : The processes whereby the cycle of incarnation is brought to an endthrough the complete integration of soul and personality. This we will approachfrom three points of view:The significance of integration.The state of mind of the soul.The elimination of the thoughtform of the personality.Second: The results of this:Within the Ashram of the Master, as far as the disciple is concerned.In the mode whereby the liberated disciple can now create a body for physicalplane contact and for service in the three worlds—this time not under the Law ofNecessity but under the Law of Service, as understood by the initiate.You will by now have realised that we have discussed the fact of death as it hasaffected the physical body (a most [506] familiar happening) and also the astralor mental sheaths—those aggregations of conditioned energy with which we are notso objectively familiar but which even psychology admits exist and which webelieve must disintegrate or disappear with the death of the physical body. Hasit, however, occurred to you that the major aspect of death with which a humanbeing is ultimately concerned is the death of the personality? I am not herespeaking in abstract terms, as do all esotericists when they work at thenegation of quality or of the qualities which characterise the personal self.They speak of “killing out” this or that quality, of completely suppressing the“lower self,” and similar phrases. Here I am speaking of the literaldestruction, dissolution, dissipation or final dispersal of that beloved andwell-known personal self.It must be borne in mind that the life of a personality falls into the followingstages:1. Its slow and gradual construction over a long period of time. For many cyclesof incarnations, a man is not a personality, he is just a member of the mass.2. The conscious identification of the soul with the personality, this stage ispractically nonexistent. The aspect of the soul which is concealed within thesheaths is for a long, long period dominated by the life of those sheaths onlymaking its presence felt through what is called “the voice of conscience.”However, as time goes on, the active intelligent life of the person is graduallyenhanced and coordinated by the energy which streams from the knowledge petalsof the egoic lotus, or from the intelligent perceptive nature of the soul on itsown plane. This produces eventually the integration of the three lower sheathsinto one functioning whole. The man is then a personality. [507]3. The personality life of the now coordinated individual persists for a largenumber of lives, and also falls into three phases:a. The phase of a dominant aggressive personality life, basically conditioned byits ray type, selfish in nature and very individualistic.b. A transitional phase wherein a conflict rages between personality and soul.The soul begins to seek liberation from form life and yet—in the lastanalysis—the personality is dependent upon the life principle, conferred by thesoul. Wording it otherwise, the conflict between the soul ray and thepersonality ray starts and the war is on between two focussed aspects of energy.This conflict terminates at the third initiation.c. The control by the soul is the final phase, leading, to the death anddestruction of the personality. This death begins when the personality, theDweller on the Threshold, stands before the Angel of the Presence. The light ofthe solar Angel then obliterates the light of matter.The “control” phase is conditioned by the complete identification of thepersonality with the soul; this is a reversal of the previous identification ofthe soul with the personality. This also is what we mean when speaking of theintegration of these two; the two are now one. It was of this phase that St.Paul was speaking when he referred (in the Epistle to the Ephesians) to Christmaking “out of two, one new man.” It is primarily the phase of the final stagesof the Probationary Path (where the work consciously begins) and its carryingforward to completion upon the Path of Discipleship. It is the stage of thepractical and successful server; it is that wherein the entire focus [508] andoutput of the life of the man is dedicated to the fulfillment of hierarchicalintent. The man begins to work on and from levels not included in the threeworlds of ordinary evolution, but which nevertheless have their effects andtheir planned objectives within those three worlds.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INTEGRATIONThe emphasis laid by most teachers and aspirants is upon the integration of thepersonality and its correct orientation towards the world of spiritual values.It should be remembered that this is an earlier stage and rightly so. Theintegration of the mind, the emotional nature and the brain is the majorcharacteristic of all advanced human beings—the bad, the very bad, the good andthe very good. It is, however, no sign of spiritual life, and is frequentlyquite the reverse. A “Hitler” or an ambitious person with a deeply selfish orcruelly directed life is a personality, with all the powers of his minddedicated to evil purposes, with the emotional nature so constituted that itpresents no obstacle to the furthering of these selfish intentions, and with ahigh-powered brain receptive to the plans and methods of the two vehicles,carrying out the behests of the personality.I would point out that the majority of people are not personalities, no matterhow glibly they may talk about their personalities. For example, the initialobjective before the mass of aspirants and students is, first of all, tointegrate the lower threefold man, so that they may become functioningpersonalities, prior to becoming functioning souls; the work is dedicated to thepurpose of producing a conscious personality focus, whilst avoiding that cycleof incarnations wherein the personality is dedicated to lower and selfish ends.Students who are more advanced are dedicated to the purpose of producing a stillhigher integration of soul and [509] personality, leading to that finalintegration which brings in the highest aspect of all, that of monadic life.There are in the world today many truly integrated personalities. These, becausesoul and personality are integrated, can tread the Path of AcceptedDiscipleship. This is a most hopeful development, if you could but realise itsimplications and significance, and the question arises as to how the others whoare as yet only in the process of reorientation can develop an adequatepersonality integration. This they will never do if they overestimate themselvesor depreciate themselves. Many are apt to regard themselves as personalitiesbecause of their natural self-will, or because they are occult students. Theyforget that an occult student is one who is in search of that which is hidden—intheir case of that hidden, integrating thread which will enable them to blendthe three bodies and thus truly merit the name of personality. Some of themcannot become personalities during this life, but they can develop the mentalconcept of its possibility and its nature; they need to remember that “as a manthinketh in his heart, so is he.” It is not waste of time, but a very necessaryprocess and one through which every Member of the Hierarchy has passed.Study and meditation combined are the factors which all aspirants should employif they seek to produce this needed integration and a consequent life ofservice. Thus the aspirant can test out both his point of integration and theextent of the serving quality produced by this integration. If aspirants wouldstudy their physical plane life with care, they would discover that they areeither working automatically in response to physical plane conventional ideas ofgoodwill or of being kind, or they are working emotionally because they like tohelp, they like to be liked, they like to relieve suffering (owing to theirhatred of the discomfort which suffering brings to them), they believe infollowing [510] the steps of the Christ Who went about doing good, or because ofa natural, deep-seated life tendency. This is a hopeful and finalisingunfoldment.Aspirants will eventually find out (when the physical and emotional phases ofthe integration are over) that there follows a phase of intelligent service,motivated in the first instance by mercy, then by conviction of itsessentiality, then by a stage of definitely spiritual ambition, then by asubmissive following of the example of the Hierarchy, and finally by theactivity of the quality of pure love; this pure love increasingly expressesitself as the higher integration of soul and personality proceeds. All thesephases of intention and of techniques are right in their own place, just as longas they have teaching value, and whilst the higher next phases remain vague andnebulous. They become wrong when they are perpetuated and carried on when thenext stage is clearly seen but not followed. Ponder on this. It is of value toyou to realise the true significance of these varying phases of integration,carried forward—as they are—under evolutionary law.All these steps upon the way of integration lead to that culminating stagewherein the personality—rich in experience, powerful in expression, reorientedand dedicated—becomes simply the mediator of soul life between the Hierarchy andHumanity. Again—ponder on this.THE STATE OF MIND OF THE SOULAnd whilst all these phases, stages and realisations are taking place in thelife of the personality, what is the attitude of the soul upon its own plane? Aconsideration of this involves, first of all, a recognition of the three aspectsof mind which are to be found upon what we call the mental plane: [511]1. The lower concrete mind, which is the attitude of thought held by the tinyaspect of the soul which was initially “put down” into manifestation at the timeof individualisation. This—during the long cycle of incarnations—has becomeincreasingly sensitive to its overshadowing Self. This overshadowing Self saysto its incarnated aspect: “Having pervaded this entire universe with a fragmentof myself, I remain.” The pull of that overshadowing “remaining Self” is whatdraws the little fragment back to its originating source.2. The Son of Mind, the soul, the product of the thought of the Universal Mind,the thinking, perceiving, discriminating, analysing Identity or spiritualEntity. This aspect of the One Life is characterised by pure mind, pure reason,pure love, and pure will. A “Lord of Sacrifice” Who, through incarnatingexperience, integration and expression, has undertaken the task of redeemingmatter, and of raising substance into Heaven! These are familiar truths andancient platitudes, but they still remain largely theory to you. You can testtheir theoretical nature by asking yourself: What am I doing, as a soul (if Ifunction as a soul at all), to raise my matter aspect, my three vehicles and thesubstance out of which they are made, on to higher planes of expression?3. The higher abstract mind which is to the soul what the lowest aspect of thesoul, embodied in the knowledge petals, is to the concrete mind. This abstractmind is the lowest aspect of the Spiritual Triad.Once integration has taken place between the personality and the soul, then thesoul—in its own body and nature and on its own plane—can begin to attend to ahigher integration or linking relation which it must eventually bring aboutbetween itself and the Spiritual Triad. Accomplishment [512] upon a lower levelever makes possible accomplishment upon a higher. There is no true higheraccomplishment until, step by step, the lower reflected aspect is mastered, usedand recognised as an instrument for bringing about still higher activities.The state of mind of the soul during the processes of lower integration can bebriefly summarised as follows:1. That of a complete disinterest during the earlier stages of the cycle ofincarnation. Its “embedded aspect” (as it has been called) is quite adequate tothe slow and tedious task of evolving the bodies, developing theircharacteristics and buying the bitter experience of blindness and ignorance.This period is by far the longest, and whilst it is proceeding the soul goesforward with its own life interest upon its own level of experience, upon itsown ray and under the influence of the Master Who will eventually guide thethinking (through gladly accepted impression) of the developing personality.Forget not that this kingdom or this aggregate of souls is what the Christiancalls the Kingdom of God and the occultist calls the spiritual Hierarchy of ourplanet. Remember also that the purpose of its aggregated life is to inducerealisation in consciousness of the spiritual polarisation of the planetaryLIFE.2. As evolution proceeds, the three vehicles—now created and developed—becomepotent, and their vibration becomes strong enough to attract a measure ofattention from the preoccupied soul. The first reaction is irritation . Occultirritation is not crossness, as human beings express it, but response tocontact—a response which does not please. In other words, it is friction. Youwill, therefore, better understand the meaning of the statement that the lastfetter which the Master casts off is [513] irritation. The personality no longerattracts attention; friction therefore ceases, and there is nothing left but apure channel through which spiritual energy can pour. Irritation, as youunderstand it, takes place when your personal, self-will, self-esteem, ideas andplans are infringed upon by those of another person. It is not this form ofirritation which the Master casts off.The second reaction is that of a meditation process or the generation of power,later to be used in the three worlds to enhance soul energy within the form andto create the field of knowledge, peopled by the thoughtforms into which thepersonality will later venture. The soul is therefore preparing for its ownreorientation towards Life and its expression in the three worlds, and not tothe gaining of life experience.3. When the personality becomes dominant, the soul introduces a new factor intothe life of its reflection, the incarnating soul. It mobilises and focusses theenergy of the soul ray, and by an act of the will brings it into direct contactwith the ray of the personality. This has a reflex action on the rays of thethreefold lower man, stimulating them, awakening them, and conditioning theetheric body so that the centres, through which the personality rays arepouring, and the head centre which is responsive to the soul ray, can becomemore active. The ajna centre, through which the personality works, intensifiesits activity, and two things occur:a. The personality life becomes increasingly potent and the man develops into anintense individual.b. The head centre begins to exert an influence upon the ajna centre, and slowlyand gradually upon the centre at the base of the spine. Self-will grows as doall the qualities. [514]4. The soul is now in what esotericists call “a process of reversal.” Thisproduces a great interest in its reflection in the three worlds, and threethings then happen:a. The lower concrete mind becomes subject to illumination from the soul.b. The energy of the soul ray increasingly pours into the personality,intensifying its conflict.c. The path of the man around the zodiac from Aries via Pisces to Taurus isreversed and he then proceeds anti-clockwise.All these factors produce violent conflict upon the Probationary Path, whichincreases as the man steps upon the Path of Discipleship. The potency of thepersonality, dominant and being dominated, is that which induces an intensekarmic activity. Events and circumstances pile fast and furiously into theexperience of the disciple. His environment is of the highest quality availablein the three worlds; his experience fluctuates between the extremes; he worksoff his karmic obligations and pays the penalty of past mistakes with greatrapidity.All this time, incarnation succeeds incarnation and the familiar process ofdeath, intervening between cycles of experience, goes on. However, all the threedeaths—physical, astral and mental—are carried out with a steadily awakeningstate of awareness, as the lower mind develops; the man no longer drifts—asleepand unknowing—out of the etheric, astral and mental vehicles, but each of thembecomes as much an event as is physical death.Finally the time comes when the disciple dies with deliberation and in fullconsciousness, and with real knowledge relinquishes his various vehicles.Steadily the soul takes control, and then the disciple brings about deaththrough an act of the soul-will and knows exactly what he is doing.THE ELIMINATION OF THE PERSONALITY THOUGHTFORM[515] In dealing with this subject (and it can only be done very briefly) twothings must be borne in mind:1. That we are considering solely an idea in the mind of the soul and dealingwith the basic fact of the illusion which has controlled the entire cycle ofincarnation and so held the soul a prisoner to form. To the soul, thepersonality connotes two things.a. The soul’s capacity for identification with form; this is first of allrealised by the soul when the personality is beginning to react to a measure ofreal integration.b. An opportunity for initiation.2. That the elimination of the thoughtform of the personality, which isconsummated at the third initiation, is a great initiation for the soul on itsown plane. For this reason, the third initiation is regarded as the first majorinitiation, since the two previous initiations have very little effect upon thesoul and only affect the incarnated soul, the “fragment” of the whole.These are facts which are little realised and seldom emphasised in any of theliterature hitherto published. The emphasis up till now has been upon theinitiations as they affect the disciple in the three worlds. But I amspecifically dealing with the initiations as they affect or do not affect thesoul , overshadowing its reflection, the personality, in the three worlds. WhatI have said, therefore, will have little meaning for the average reader.From the angle of the personal self, regarding itself as the Dweller on theThreshold, the attitude or state of mind has been inadequately portrayed as oneof complete obliteration in the light of the soul; the glory of the Presence,transmuted [516] by the Angel, is such that the personality completelydisappears, with its demands and its aspirations. Naught is left but the shell,the sheath and the instrument through which the solar light can pour for thehelping of humanity. This is true to a certain degree, but is only—in the lastanalysis—man’s attempt to put into words the transmuting and the transfiguringeffect of the third initiation, which cannot be done.Infinitely more difficult is the attempt I am here making to depict the attitudeand the reactions of the soul, the one self, the Master in the heart, as itrecognises the stupendous fact of its own essential liberation and realises onceand for all, that it is now incapable of responding in any way to lowervibrations of the three worlds, as transmitted to the soul by its instrument ofcontact, the personality form. That form is now incapable of transmission.The second reaction of the soul, once this realisation has been focussed andadmitted, is that—having achieved freedom—that freedom now conveys its owndemands:1. For a life of service in the three worlds, so familiar and now so completelytranscended.2. An overshadowing sense of outgoing love towards those who are, as yet,seeking liberation.3. A recognition of the essential triangle which has now become the centre ofthe conceptual life of the soul:[Image00013.jpg][517] The soul now vibrates between the two points or pairs of opposites andacts as an invocative and evocative centre.None of the above realisations may be registered in the brain consciousness orin the mind of the illumined personality. Theoretically, some dim vision of theinherent possibilities may be sensed, but the consciousness is no longer that ofthe serving disciple in the three worlds, using mind, emotions and physical bodyto carry out behest and hierarchical intent, as far as may be. That hasdisappeared with the death of the personality consciousness. The consciousnessis now that of the soul itself, aware of no separation, instinctively active,spiritually obsessed by the plans of the Kingdom of God, and completely freefrom the lure or the faintest control of matter-form; the soul is, however,still responsive to and immersed in substance-energy, and its highercorrespondence is still functioning on the levels of the cosmic physicalplane—the buddhic, atmic, monadic and logoic planes.What then must take place if the life of the soul is to be full and complete andso thoroughly inclusive that the three worlds form part of its area of awarenessand its field of service? The only way in which I can make clear to you what thesoul must do after the third initiation is to sum it up in two ways:First: The soul now becomes a conscious creator because the thirdaspect—developed and mastered through experience in the three worlds during thelong cycle of incarnations—has reached a point of perfected activity. Putting ittechnically: the energy of the knowledge petals and the energy of the lovepetals are now so actively fused and blended that two of the inner petals,surrounding the jewel in the lotus, are no longer acting [518] as veils to thatjewel. I am here speaking symbolically. Because of this happening, the death orthe elimination of the personality is the first activity in the drama ofconscious creation, and the first form created by the soul is a substitute forthe personality. Thus an instrument for service in the three worlds is created.This time, however, it is an instrument with no life, no desire, no ambition andno power of thought of its own. It is only a sheath of substance, animated bysoul life but—at the same time—responsive to and suited to the period, race andthe environing conditions wherein the creating soul chooses to work. Think thisstatement out and emphasise the words “suited to.”Second. The soul then prepares itself for the coming fourth initiation. This isbasically a monadic experience and results—as you know—in the disappearance ordestruction of the soul vehicle or causal body, and the establishment,therefore, of a direct relation between the monad on its own plane and the newlycreated personality, via the antahkarana.These two points are given to you for the first time in the sequential givingout of the occult teaching; hints have, however, prepared the way for these twofacts. Information has also been given anent the mayavirupa through which theMaster works and contacts the three worlds and which He deliberately creates inorder to serve His purposes and plans. It is a definite substitute for thepersonality and can only be created when the old personality (built anddeveloped during the cycle of incarnation) has been eliminated. I prefer theword “eliminated” to the word “destroyed.” The structure —at the time ofelimination—persists, but its separative life has gone.[519] If you will think clearly about this statement, you will see that a verycomplete integration is now possible. The personality life has been absorbed;the personality form is still left, but it persists without any real life of itsown; this means that it can now be the recipient of energies and forces neededby the working initiate or Master in order to carry on the work or salvaginghumanity. Students would find it of value to study the three “appearances of theChrist” as recorded in the Gospel story:1. His transfigured appearance upon the Mount of Transfiguration. That episodedepicts symbolically the radiant soul, and also the three vacated bodies of thepersonality, and hints also at a future building of a vehicle of manifestation.St. Peter says, “Lord, let us here build three huts” or tabernacles.2. His appearance as truth itself (silent yet present) before the bar orjudgment seat of Pilate—repudiated by the world of men but recognised by theHierarchy.3. His radiant appearances after the resurrection initiation:a. To the woman at the sepulchre—symbolising His contact with Humanity.b. To the two disciples on the way to Emmaus—symbolising His contact with theHierarchy.c. To the twelve disciples in the upper chamber—symbolising His contact with theCouncil Chamber of the Lord of the World at Shamballa.You can thus see the factual nature of the results to which I earlier referredin this instruction. The disciple who has eliminated (in the technical sense aswell as in the mystical sense) the hold of the personality has now the “freedomof the Ashram,” as it is called; he can move at will among his fellow disciplesand initiates. There will be nothing in his [520] vibratory life or his qualitywhich can disturb the rhythm of the Ashram; there will be nothing to call forththe “calming intervention” of the Master, as is frequently the case during theearlier stages of discipleship; nothing can now interfere with those highercontacts and spheres of influence which have hitherto been sealed to thedisciple because of the intrusion of his own personality."},{"pageContent":"PART THREE - THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF HEALING[521] We have now completed two sections of our consideration of the art ofhealing. We have dealt somewhat cursorily with the causes of disease and havenoted that they emanate as a whole from three main sources: the psychologicalstate of the patient, his karmic liabilities, and those which are incurredthrough his group relationship, environal, national or planetary. I then dealtwith certain basic requirements of conditions and attitudes which must beestablished between the healer and the patient, and finally I took up thesubject of death. I considered it as it affected the three transitory vehicles,emphasising its divine nature and its constructive purpose. We now reach thesection in which the Laws of Healing and the Rules which should condition thehealing process must be briefly considered.We have found that there are ten laws and six rules. The tenth law will be foundtoo abstruse for much elucidation; it concerns the life principle, of which weas yet know nothing, and is involved with monadic purpose. All occult teaching,which emanates directly from the Hierarchy, contains within it the living seedof that which will follow later. In The Secret Doctrine , for instance, H.P.B.(under my instruction) made occasional reference, very briefly and obscurely, tothe antahkarana; she thus left the seed which, [522] when full grown, willindicate the requirements for those who—having achieved the higherinitiations—can enter upon the Way of the Higher Evolution. In this tenth law,therefore, I embody also the seed for a much later approach to the problems ofLife and Death.I would here remind you that a law is in reality the effect of the life of agreater entity as it encloses a lesser within its living processes. It embodiesthat formulated purpose or organised will of an enfolding life, against whichthe expressed purpose or determined will of that which is enfolded is entirelyhelpless. You might argue, brother of mine, that this statement negates thefreewill of the individual unit thus enclosed or enfolded. It assuredly doesmilitate against the form aspect of manifestation—that aspect, for instance, ofwhich a human being is pre-eminently conscious. Therefore, this relationship ofthe higher or greater and the lower or lesser, will equally and assuredlydominate and eventually render futile the lesser laws of the form nature, thosewhich today are called the laws of nature.Equally essentially, however, the soul within all forms. is at war with thoseforms, and in its own integral life is conditioned by the higher laws which arethe laws of its own being; these it freely obeys and follows, having noslightest wish to do otherwise. There is, therefore, no essential infringementof the freewill of the subject; there is only resistance from that which we callthe “not-self” or the material aspect. This might be called the basic cause ofall disease.What we call the Laws of Nature were the highest phase of the divine lifepossible in the first solar system. They are primarily the laws inherent in thelife aspect of the form and have in them, therefore, the seeds of death. TheLaws of the Soul as they subordinate and render negative the Laws of Nature, arethe highest laws to which humanity [523] (the highest kingdom in nature atpresent) can respond, and these—when fulfilled—will conclude the purpose of thesecond solar system. The Laws of Life itself will finally supersede the Laws ofthe Soul and will completely offset and negate the Laws of Nature; these lawswill be distinctive of the third solar system—the last personality expression ofthe solar Logos through the medium of the seven planetary Logoi with theirvarying forms and soul expressions.Three Groups of LawsWe have, therefore, three groups of laws which govern the expression of theliving purpose in this second solar system—one developed and another developing,with the third latent and relatively quiescent.1. The Laws of Nature—the separative laws of the form nature.2. The Laws of the Soul—the blending laws of group integrity.3. The Laws of Life—the dynamic laws of Being itself.It is with certain aspects of the Laws of the Soul that we shall now deal, forthey concern the integrity and activity of the soul in form. This must be mostcarefully borne in mind. Disease is something which attacks the integrity or theharmony of the form nature which the inner spiritual man must use in order tomake his contacts in the three worlds which constitute his environment when inincarnation. The ten laws which we shall consider might, therefore, be regardedas ten subsidiary laws of the fundamental Law of Essential Integrity. Theyconstitute nine elaborations or aspects of that one law, and this you must havemost carefully in mind. It is with these laws that the true healer must everwork.[524] The six rules deal only with the application of this realised integrity tothe conditions and situation with which the healer is confronted. Integrityinvolves focus, tension and expression (simultaneously realised, consciouslygenerated and dynamically used).Qualities Required of the HealerIn the laws and rules which I have given, certain necessary characteristics ofthe healer are mentioned and certain needed requirements are indicated. These weshould register first of all as they not only present qualities and attitudeswhich are essential to the successful practice of the healing art, but theyindicate also why—up till the present time—there has been practically nosuccessful or systematised healing of any patient under any of the currenthealing schools. There has been what I might call “accidental healing,” due tothe fact that the patient would have been healed anyway, for his hour to passover had not yet arrived. Deliberate conscious healing, with full understanding,has only occurred when the healer was an initiate of high degree, patterninghimself upon the life and the nature of the Christ.Let us now look at the indicated qualities and attitudes. I will brieflyenumerate and comment.1. The power to contact and work as a soul. “The art of the healer consists inreleasing the soul.” Think for a moment what this power involves. The healer isnot only in immediate and conscious touch with his own soul, but through thatsoul contact he can easily contact the soul of his patient.2. The power to command the spiritual will . The particular law involved in thehealing act must be “brought into activity by the spiritual will.” Thisnecessitates the capacity to make contact with the Spiritual Triad. [525]Therefore, the antahkarana must be somewhat in process of construction.3. The power to establish telepathic rapport. The healer must “know the innerstage of thought and of desire” of his patient.4. He must have exact knowledge . We read that he must “know the point exactthrough which relief must come.” This is a most important point and one entirelyoverlooked by the so-called healers in such movements as Christian Science,Unity and others. Healing does not come through an intense affirmation ofdivinity, or by simply pouring out love and the expression of a vague mysticism.It comes through mastering an exact science of contact, of impression, ofinvocation, plus an understanding of the subtle apparatus of the ethericvehicle.5. The power to reverse, reorient and “exalt” the consciousness of the patient.The healer has to “lift the downward focussed eyes unto the soul.” This refersto the eyes of the patient. This statement implies limitation, because if thepatient is not at the stage in evolution where this is possible, and at thepoint in evolution where he can contact his own soul, the work of the healer isrendered inevitably futile. The sphere of action, therefore, of the spiritualhealer is strictly limited to those who have faith. Faith, however, is the“evidence of things not seen”; that evidence is largely lacking in the majority.Faith is not wishful thinking or an engineered hope. It is evidence of awell-grounded conviction.6. Power to direct soul energy to the necessary area. “The spiritual or thethird eye then directs the healing force.” This presupposes a scientifictechnique on the healer’s part and the right functioning of the mechanism ofreceived and directed force within the head.[526]7. Power to express magnetic purity and the needed radiance. “The healer mustachieve magnetic purity...and attain dispelling radiance.” This involves greatpersonal discipline in the daily life, and the habit of pure living. Purityinevitably and automatically results in radiance.8. Power to control the activity of the mechanism of the head. The healer musthave “linked the centres in the head.” The true healer has established amagnetic area within his head which presents itself or expresses itself througha definitely recognisable radiation.9. Power over his own centres. The healer has to “concentrate the needed energywithin the needed centre.” The centre in the patient’s form which is nearest tothe seat of the physical trouble has to be made receptive to the energydischarged into it by the corresponding centre in the healer’s body. It will beobvious to you, therefore, how much knowledge and energy-control is required bythe true healer.10. Power to utilise both the exoteric and esoteric methods of healing. Thehealer will employ “methods of occult healing though the ordinary medical andsurgical methods will not be withheld.” I have constantly emphasised theGod-given nature of experimental medicine—which is a phrase qualifying medicinetoday, and qualifying still more metaphysical healing. There is no need to callin a spiritual healer for broken bones or for those difficulties which orthodoxmedicine has already mastered. However, the patient’s general morale andcondition can be justifiably helped whilst wise surgery and ameliorating medicalknowledge are applied. This the usual so-called metaphysical healer is apt toignore. Healers will be divided eventually into two groups: [527]a. Those comprising definitely trained spiritual healers.b. Healers with less developed power but with enough radiation and magnetism toaid in the ordinary healing process. These will usually work under the guidanceof the spiritual healer.11. Power to work magnetically . “Thus he can pour the vital healing force uponthe patient.” This the healer does through a scientific coordination of hisequipment, using the hands as a directing agent. In this way the disease can behealed, ameliorated or worsened, even to the point of death. The responsibilityof the healer is therefore great.12. Power to work with radiation. “Thus can his presence feed the soul life ofthe patient.” This again is brought about through a system of coordination, butthe agent of radiation is then the aura and not the hands.13. Power to practice at all times complete harmlessness. “The method used bythe Perfect One...is harmlessness.” This, we are told, involves a positiveexpression of poise, an inclusive point of view, and divine understanding. Howmany healers combine these three qualities and also work through love?14. Power to control the will and work through love . “The healer...must keepthe will in leash.” This is one of the most difficult qualities to be developed,for the will of the healer is frequently so potent in its determination to bringabout a healing that it renders the effort to apply that healing processentirely futile. From the reverse angle, frequently the sentimental and mysticaldesire to love the patient negates all efforts to hold the will in leash.Remember, brother of mine, the spiritual will must be present as a quiet [528]deep pool of power behind all expression of the energy of love.15. Power eventually to wield the Law of Life . Of this little can be said, forit can only be wielded by those who have developed or who are rapidly developingthe consciousness of the Spiritual Triad—a very rare thing as yet.In the study of these requirements there is no need for discouragement. Such astudy will serve to set a needed goal for all healers in the New Age. It willalso explain why the various healing systems which are practiced todaythroughout the world (particularly in the Anglo-American countries) havehitherto notably failed, in spite of their claims. None of them—if they keptproperly certified records which would be scientifically accurate (andpractically none of them do)—would register more than the tiniest percentage ofcures based upon pure spiritual healing. The percentage cured is less than onein a million “cures.” These cures would have recovered in any case in due time,if left to nature or to ordinary medical and surgical science.But today, so great is the spiritual stimulation in the world, and so vast arethe numbers responding to it, that the moving forward of a large group out ofthe ranks of average humanity on to the Path of Discipleship is inevitable. Thismoving forward will provide—during the next five hundred years—many healers whowill fulfill to some degree the requirements which I have listed above.The philosophies endorsed by the various systems such as Unity and ChristianScience are basically sound and state the fundamental platitudes (the essentialtruths, nevertheless) which underlie all that I have said above. People,however, are not healed by the enunciation of platitudes, by [529] theaffirmation of divinity or by the statement of abstract theories. They will behealed when the right time comes because of the ability of the healer in the NewAge to express in himself and in his daily life the quality of divinity, to bespiritually capable of invoking the soul of his patient, and also to bemagnetically pure, and through the power of a particular type of radiated energyto stimulate the patient to heal himself—through the medium of his own innermechanism. The healer in the New Age will possess the ability to make thefollowing contacts with both ease and understanding:1. With his own soul.2. With the soul of the patient.3. With the particular type of energy which is to be found either in the soul orthe personality ray of the patient.4. With any one of his own centres which is needed by him in order to act as atransmitting agency for energy to be sent into an area governed by some centrein the body of the patient.5. With the centre in the patient’s etheric body which controls the area wherethe disease is located.This, as you can appreciate, connotes much technical knowledge. Added to this,the healer must also possess that spiritual perception which will enable him tointuit the “karma of the moment,” as it is esoterically called, and therefore toknow if a cure is permissible, practicable, or impossible. This is a form ofknowledge which no healer in the world at this time possesses, no matter whathis claim may be. Again I say, this is no cause for discouragement.What is truly needed, and what will be brought about as the decades elapse, willbe that disciples and men and women of spiritual orientation will enter themedical profession [530] and perfect themselves in the techniques of orthodoxmedicine and in an exoteric knowledge of physical anatomy and of pathologicalsymptoms, plus the orthodox remedies and modes of handling disease. To thistechnical knowledge and understanding they will add a measure of esotericlearning, and they will then begin to combine, whilst practising theirprofession, both the exoteric and the esoteric wisdom which is theirs. This willat first be purely experimental, but out of the experience gained in utilisingboth fields of knowledge a new medical science will emerge, based upon twoparamount recognised factors:1. A cumulative mass of knowledge and information anent the dense physicalvehicle. This has been accumulated by men of science down the ages and islargely proven and true.2. A constantly growing understanding of the nature of the etheric body, of thecentres, and of the transmission and circulation of certain controlled energies.This combination of two aspects of truth will be greatly facilitated by theincreasing sensitivity and almost clairvoyant perception of developing humanity.One of the outstanding results of the recent world war will be found to be atremendously increased capacity for nervous reaction. This nervous receptivityis at present abnormal and the results are sad. The reason for this is that thenervous apparatus of the average human being (and by that I mean his nervoussystem, plus the nadis which underlie it) is not yet adequate to the demandsupon it. Time, however, will adjust all this.Both metaphysical healers and orthodox medical men at this time are apt torepudiate each other with much violence. Taking it as a whole, the orthodoxphysician is less rabid and exclusive than the modern metaphysician. They [531]know too well the limitations of their present medical attainments. But theso-called spiritual healer recognises at present no limitations, and thisdefinitely constitutes a weakness. Both groups, in time, must becomecollaborators with each other and not opponents. Both have much to learn fromeach other, and both must recognise that the particular fields of knowledge forwhich they stand are equally a divine expression and indicate the ability of thehuman mind to search, to record, to discover and to formulate truth, so thatothers may benefit thereby.I would recall to your attention the fact that both groups have much to do—theone in penetrating into the realm of the subtle and the intangible (and this israpidly being done), and the other in descending from its vague abstractions andimpractical generalisations in order to learn to recognise the facts anent theobjective and the tangible; this is not as yet being done; metaphysical healing,so-called, is lost amidst a mist of words and high-sounding affirmations.The sincerity of the majority of those who belong to these schools of thought isunquestioned; their motives are almost uniformly sincere and good. In bothgroups charlatans are to be found and also a small—a very small—minority ofself-seeking and ignorant exploiters of men. Among them are numbered bothphysicians and metaphysicians who are commercially oriented; they are, however,a minority. In the sincere investigator and lover of humanity in both groupswill be found the future hope of medical science as it seeks to meet the need ofhumanity—a humanity which is becoming increasingly sensitive and subjectivelyoriented."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII - THE LAWS AND RULES ENUMERATED AND APPLIED[532] Note: Certain of the Rules are related to certain of the Laws and will beconsidered by me in their rightful relationship. I have asked A.A.B. to givehere a list of the ten laws and—where a rule is related to a particular law—togive it with that law. The rules are renumbered and do not follow in the orderearlier given.LAW IAll disease is the result of inhibited soul life. This is true of all forms inall kingdoms. The art of the healer consists in releasing the soul so that itslife can flow through the aggregate of organisms which constitute any particularform.LAW IIDisease is the product of and subject to three influences: first, a man’s past,wherein he pays the price of ancient error; second, his inheritance, wherein heshares with all mankind those tainted streams of energy which are of grouporigin; third, he shares with all the natural forms that which the Lord of Lifeimposes on His body. These three influences are called the “Ancient Law of EvilSharing.” This must give place some day to that new “Law of Ancient DominatingGood” which lies behind all that God has made. This law must be brought intoactivity by the spiritual will of man. [533]RULE ONELet the healer train himself to know the inner stage of thought or of desire ofthe one who seeks his help. He can thereby know the source from whence thetrouble comes. Let him relate the cause and the effect and know the point exactthrough which relief must come.LAW IIIDisease is an effect of the basic centralisation of a man’s life energy. Fromthe plane whereon those energies are focussed proceed those determiningconditions which produce ill health. These therefore work out as disease or asfreedom from disease.LAW IVDisease, both physical and psychological, has its roots in the good, thebeautiful, and the true. It is but a distorted reflection of divinepossibilities. The thwarted soul, seeking full expression of some divinecharacteristic or inner spiritual reality, produces, within the substance of itssheaths, a point of friction. Upon this point the eyes of the personality arefocussed and this leads to disease. The art of the healer is concerned with thelifting of the downward focussed eyes unto the soul, the true Healer within theform. The spiritual or third eye then directs the healing force and all is well.RULE TWOThe healer must achieve magnetic purity, through purity of life. He must attainthat dispelling radiance which shows itself in every man when he has linked thecentres in the head. When this magnetic field is established, the radiation thengoes forth.LAW VThere is naught but energy, for God is Life. Two energies meet in man, but otherfive are present. For each is to be found a central point of contact. Theconflict of these energies with forces and of forces twixt themselves [534]produce the bodily ills of man. The conflict of the first and second persistsfor ages until the mountain top is reached—the first great mountain top. Thefight between the forces produces all disease, all ills and bodily pain whichseeks release in death. The two, the five and thus the seven, plus that whichthey produce, possess the secret. This is the fifth Law of Healing within theworld of form.RULE THREELet the healer concentrate the needed energy within the needed centre. Let thatcentre correspond to the centre which has need. Let the two synchronise andtogether augment force. Thus shall the waiting form be balanced in its work.Thus shall the two and the one, under right direction, heal.LAW VIWhen the building energies of the soul are active in the body, then there ishealth, clean interplay and right activity. When the builders are the lunarlords and those who work under the control of the moon and at the behest of thelower personal self, then you have disease, ill health and death.LAW VIIWhen life or energy flows unimpeded and through right direction to itsprecipitation (the related gland), then the form responds and ill healthdisappears.RULE FOURA careful diagnosis of disease, based on the ascertained outer symptoms, will besimplified to this extent—that once the organ involved is known and thusisolated, the centre in the etheric body which is in closest relation to it willbe subjected to methods of occult healing, though the ordinary, ameliorative,medical or surgical methods will not be withheld.LAW VIIIDisease and death are the results of two active forces. One is the will of thesoul, which says to its instrument: [535] I draw the essence back. The other isthe magnetic power of the planetary life, which says to the life within theatomic structure: The hour of reabsorption has arrived. Return to me. Thus,under cyclic law, do all forms act.RULE FIVEThe healer must seek to link his soul, his heart, his brain and his hands. Thuscan he pour the vital healing force upon the patient. This is magnetic work. Itcures disease or increases the evil state, according to the knowledge of thehealer.The healer must seek to link his soul, his brain, his heart and auric emanation.Thus can his presence feed the soul life of the patient. This is the work ofradiation . The hands are needed not. The soul displays its power. The patient’ssoul responds through the response of his aura to the radiation of the healer’saura, flooded with soul energy.LAW IXPerfection calls imperfection to the surface. Good drives evil from the form ofman in time and space. The method used by the Perfect One and that employed byGood is harmlessness. This is not negativity but perfect poise, a completedpoint of view and divine understanding.RULE SIXThe healer or the healing group must keep the will in leash. It is not will thatmust be used, but love.LAW XHearken, O Disciple, to the call which comes from the Son to the Mother, andthen obey. The Word goes forth that form has served its purpose. The principleof mind then organises itself and then repeats that Word. The waiting formresponds and drops away. The soul stands free.Respond, O Rising One, to the call which comes within the sphere of obligation;recognise the call emerging from the Ashram or from the Council Chamber wherewaits the Lord [536] of Life Himself. The Sound goes forth. Both soul and formtogether must renounce the principle of life and thus permit the Monad to standfree. The soul responds. The form then shatters the connection. Life is nowliberated, owning the quality of conscious knowledge and the fruit of allexperience. These are the gifts of soul and form combined.Note: This last law is the enunciation of a new law which is substituted for theLaw of Death, and which has reference only to those upon the later stages of thePath of Discipleship and the stages upon the Path of Initiation.Application of the Laws and RulesIn the last few pages I greatly clarified the issue of indicating—even at therisk of somewhat discouraging you—certain of the essential requirements of thehealer in the New Age, and also certain of the contacts which he will have tomake with facility and promptness when attempting to heal. I likewise definedfor you the nature of Law. This was preliminary to a consideration of the Lawsto which the healer must conform and the Rules which he will automatically andintuitively obey. We might consider these Laws and Rules in relation to thehealer and also in relation to each other, for several of the Rules are closelyrelated to a Law which controls the healer.From the definition of law, as given above, it will be apparent to you that inthe last analysis disease, death, untruth, falsity and despair are inherent inthe planet itself, because our planetary Logos (as I earlier stated when aidingH.P.B. in writing The Secret Doctrine ) is an “imperfect God.” After the presentgreat world crisis, incident to our planetary Logos having moved forward uponthe cosmic Path, and therefore having taken a cosmic initiation, Hisimperfections are demonstrably lessened: there will be less distress and diseaseon earth once the necessary planetary [537] adjustments have been made. This youyourselves will not see take place, for adjustments on such a large scale takecenturies to effect. What I have, therefore, to say upon the future healing ofdisease will not be of practical value for a long time to come, but the theoryand the indications of possibility must be considered and discussed. Also, for along time, medical practice and surgical knowledge will play their useful partsin preventive medicine, alleviative practices and curative processes. To theseincreasingly will be added many psychological methods of healing, and these willgo hand in hand with the two above; to these again the services of the spiritualhealers will be added. In this way, a rounded-out approach to the whole man willbe steadily developed, and the need for this is today recognised by forwardthinking physicians everywhere. Thus, and also through the method of trial anderror, much will be learnt.The healing processes I outline and indicate through these Laws and Rules arebasically new. They are not based on affirmations, as in Christian Science andother mental healing cults; they are not posited on affirmed origins and onclaiming results which will only be possible when the race has reached a farhigher standard of perfection than is at present seen or that is immediatelycapable of development. As I have several times said in this treatise, there isnothing fundamentally wrong in the claims made by these groups and organisationsanent the man who has arrived at soul expression and at realisation of theChrist consciousness. What is wrong is the claim that the ordinary man(obviously not at this advanced point in evolution) can perform these miraclesof healing either in himself or for others. Very few people have as yet reachedthis point, and the healer in these cults and organisations who has done so is ararity indeed. The healer in the New Age will recognise limitation andconditioning circumstances, plus destiny. This predisposes the [538] developmentwithin him of knowledge-giving powers. He is also spiritually aware that thehealing of the physical body is not always the highest spiritual good; theoverestimation and serious, anxious care of the form life, of the physicalvehicle, is not of major importance.The healer in the New Age does not and will not work directly with the physicalbody at all; being an occultist, he will regard that body as not a principle. Heworks practically entirely with the etheric body and with the vital energies,leaving those energies to make their impact on the automaton of the physicalbody according to directed intent; they will then produce their effect accordingto the response of that body, conditioned as it will be by many factors. Theseenergies, directed via the etheric body of the patient, or emanating from thatbody, may bring about a cure if the destiny of the patient permits, or they mayso stimulate the area of the disease that the disease will be brought to acrisis and the patient will die. This often happens under the ministrations ofcultist healers who are ignorant of the laws of healing and who base theiractivities on a realisation of a present (though usually unexpressed) divinity.A much higher measure of spiritual perception and of mental understanding isrequired before the system I propose becomes elective. All that I give in mywritings is largely of a pioneer nature, and this should be remembered.Let us now study Law One; it has no Rule attached or related to it, as it is abasic statement, indicating the major underlying theory upon which the healerwill work.LAW IAll disease is the result of inhibited soul life. This is true of all forms inall kingdoms. The art of the healer consists in releasing the soul so that itslife can flow through the aggregate of organisms which constitute any particularform,[539] This law indicates that, owing to the fact that the threefold lower man isnot under control of his soul, disease can destroy him. Because the free flow ofthe energy pouring from the soul is inhibited and limited, disease can findplace in the physical body. The physical organism is correctly supplied with thecreative regenerating energy of the true man, the soul on its own plane. Wherethere is complete unobstructed inflow from the soul to the seven vitalisingcentres, you have the perfect health which the initiate of the fourth degreedemonstrates, unless some disciplinary, experimental or initiating karma isbeing tried out in his case. However, as a general rule apart from these orplanetary conditions, an initiate of high degree needs no healer; there isnothing in him requiring healing.What must the healer do when, faced with a patient, he realises the inhibitedcondition which the disease evidences? Does he, under the law, work with thesoul of the patient? Does he seek to get that soul (on its own plane) to affectdefinitely the man, superintending the transfer of energy from the soul to themind, and from the mind to the astral body, and from thence to the ethericvehicle? By no means. In cases of real and serious illness, the condition of thepatient is usually such that it is not possible for him to make the neededresponse to such attempted ministrations of the healer, either consciously orunconsciously. Any mental exertion is quite beyond his power, and he could not,therefore, cooperate with the effort of his soul to transfer energy; theactivity of his astral body is usually concentrated in the formulation of agreat desire to live and to get rid of the disease, unless the illness is soacute that the patient has reached the stage where he simply does not care andthe will-to-live is rapidly leaving him. To these difficulties must be added thefact that very few people are so completely integrated that they can function aswhole personalities, in [540] response to soul stimulation. They are usuallypolarised in one or another of their three bodies, and this fact again presentsa potent limiting condition to the healer. Again, and very frequently, the manis so intensely preoccupied with discomfort and pain present in the densephysical body, that the higher impressions which might come through from mind orsoul bodies are quite unable to do so. What then must the trained and instructedhealer do?He must realise, first of all, that the etheric body is the factor of majorimportance and the main vehicle with which he must deal. He thereforeconcentrates upon that body of energy. This involves the necessity ofascertaining certain facts, and then making certain points of contacteffectively useful.The first fact to be ascertained is the potency with which the soul has grippedand is still gripping its personality. The healer is aware that because thepatient is still alive, the soul is definitely present through the medium of thehead and heart centres of the etheric body, thus anchoring both theconsciousness and the life principles. If the patient is unconscious, thedifficulties of the healer are greatly increased in some cases, though lightenedin others. If the principle of consciousness is withdrawn from the head centrein the vital body, then the healer knows that death may supervene and his way isthis much clearer, particularly if there is a dimming of the light of life inthe heart. If consciousness is still powerfully present, he realises that thereis still the possibility of cure, and can then, with greater confidence, proceedwith the work to be done. In this statement, I am dealing with the averageperson. In the case of initiates, it is somewhat different, because theyfrequently remain fully conscious through the death process.You will, therefore, realise the basic necessity for the healer in the New Ageto be either clairvoyant or—far better [541] still—to have true spiritualperception with its quality of infallibility. His first task is to investigateor “occultly see” the etheric body of the patient, and thus arrive at thefollowing knowledge:1. The potency with which the soul influences its etheric body. This isindicated by the point of light in the head centre and the area which itirradiates.2. The condition of the etheric centre which controls or governs the area withinwhich the physical trouble is to be found.3. The relation of the centres above the diaphragm to those below, because thiswill give him a general indication of the point in evolution of the man to behealed.Having ascertained these points to the best of his ability, he will then, underthe law of “inhibited soul life,” seek by the power of his own soul (working onthe higher levels of the mental plane and through his head centre) to stimulatethe point of soul life in the etheric body of the patient. He will do this witha view of attracting, if possible, a fuller inflow of the soul energy of thepatient into the head centre, in order that the life thread may carry a fullersupply of life to the heart. In this manner, the patient’s own “livingness” willbring about the desired cure; he will be healed apparently by nature itself, orby the natural and normal way of adequate vitality, and so enabled to throw offthe disease.When the healer, therefore, recognises and works with this law, the followingpoints of contact are recognised and used:1. The soul of the patient, anchored within his etheric body. [542]2. The soul of the healer, occupied with the stimulation of that point of soulcontact, via the following triangle of energy:[Image00014.jpg]This relates the vital body of the healer to that of the patient, via both theirhead centres and the heart of the patient, because there the life principle isfocussed and is closely involved and affected by whatever occurs.3. When this triangle of energy is functioning smoothly and a measure ofresponse is coming from the head centre of the patient, evoking greater soulcontact and producing a resultant inflow of soul energy into the head centre andfrom thence to the heart centre, then—by an act of the will and the use of aninvocative mantram—the healer will seek to implement this increased flow oflife, via the heart, to the diseased area, using the centre which controls thatarea of the physical body, whichever this may be. This has to be done with thegreatest possible care, so that the flow is not too sudden, and thereforedestructive in its effects; particular care has also to be evidenced in thecases of disease of the heart: embolisms, for instance, which prove fatal arefrequently due to a violent expression on the part of the patient of thewill-to-live, bringing on a flooding inflow of the life principle. This makesits impact too suddenly upon the heart, causing equally sudden movement in theblood stream, and thus of the embolism, producing death. I am putting this intoentirely untechnical terms [543] and laying myself open to expert criticism, butI am doing so in order to convey to the lay reader a general idea of the risksinvolved, and thus produce caution in the enthusiast.This law covers certain fundamental premises, and there is little more than Ican profitably say anent its implications. Much will be learnt by accepting thepremises and working upon their implications. What I have said is very far frombeing what I could have said, but I have here given the student a simple andworking understanding of certain essential and basic concepts. We will now passon to a consideration of the second Law and of Rule One.LAW IIDisease is the product of and subject to three influences: first, a man’s past,wherein he pays the price of ancient error; second, his inheritance, wherein heshares with all mankind those tainted streams of energy which are of grouporigin; third, he shares with all natural forms that which the Lord of Lifeimposes on His body. These three influences are called the “Ancient Law of EvilSharing.” This must give place some day to the new “Law of Ancient DominatingGood” which lies behind all that God has made. This law must be brought intoactivity by the spiritual will of man .This Law is most comprehensive in its statements and really constitutes asummation of two laws, one of which is controlling at this time and one whichwill eventually control. Let us, for the sake of clarity, and because peopleusually read so carelessly, divide this law up into its various statements, andthus gain a better idea of its implications:1. Disease is a product of and subject to three influences: [544]a. A man’s past, wherein he pays the price of ancient error.b. His inheritance, wherein he shares with all mankind those tainted streams ofenergy which are of group origin.c. His sharing with all natural forms that which the Lord of Life imposes on Hisbody.2. These three types of energy are called the “Ancient Law of Evil Sharing.”3. The “Law of Ancient Dominating Good” lies behind all that God has made.4. This law will some day supersede the “Ancient Law of Evil Sharing.”5. It will be brought into activity by the spiritual will of man.This law throws a man in his thinking back to the basic law of karma which, asyou know, there is no avoiding, and which the modern healer in the presenthealing cults and organisations consistently overlooks. With these influencesand predisposing causes we have already dealt, and there is no need further toelaborate them here, beyond remarking that one of the most helpful things for apatient to remember and for the healer to bear in mind is that disease has itsroots in the past (a group past or an individual past) and may, in the lastanalysis, be a beneficent way of paying off ancient debts. This induces in thepatient a constructive attitude of acquiescence—not an acquiescence which leadsto non-action, but one which produces a sense of responsibility for rightaction. This right action will lead either to full payment of the penaltythrough the well-known process of death or to the success of the steps taken toinduce health. In the case of the healer, it will lead to a recognition ofpotent forces working through the patient and a willingness [545] for thedestined fate to take place; in both cases the feverish anxiety so often presentwill not intervene between the healer’s intention and the patient, preventingsound happenings.The second important thing is for the patient to remember, if his conditionpermits, that what he is enduring is the fate and the lot of the majority, andthat he is not alone. A right handling of ill health is a major factor inbreaking down separateness and a sense of aloneness and isolation; that is whythe effects of bad health, when rightly handled, lead to a sweetening of thedisposition and a broadening of the sympathies. Sharing and a sense of generalparticipation has usually to be learnt the hard way—such again is the law. Inthis law we have the clue to that which will ultimately sweep disease from theearth. Let me put it quite simply. When the majority of the inhabitants of theearth are being rapidly oriented towards good, towards righteousness, as theBible expresses it, and when the bulk of human beings are inclined towardsgoodwill (the second major expression of soul contact and influence in theindividual’s life and in the life of mankind—the first being the sense ofresponsibility), then ill health will persistently, even if only gradually,disappear and die out and finally be nonexistent. Slowly, very slowly, this isalready happening—not yet in the disappearance of disease, but in the bringingabout of a more correct orientation. What this really means is that the channelof contact between the individual and his soul and the soul of humanity isbecoming more direct and unimpeded. Alignment is being brought about. You cansee again, therefore, why the emphasis in the life of the healer must be laidupon contact and alignment, and why so few succeed. There is little if anycontact to be found among healers today, and little direct consciousness of thenecessity, [546] and no real understanding of the techniques to be followed. Itis wise to grasp this important point, for it will negate disappointment.Disease is not going to disappear miraculously and suddenly from a world in theimmediate period, heralding the New Age. If it did, the implications would bethat the Law of Karma no longer controlled, and this is not the case.The final sentence of this second law gives a basic indication of the timeperiod: the Law of Dominating Good will be brought into activity by thespiritual will of man. What does this mean? It means that only when truly largenumbers of men are controlled by the Spiritual Triad, have built the antahkaranaand can therefore use the spiritual will, can disease be stamped out and onlygood control. It will of course be a gradual process, and in the early stagesalmost imperceptible. Again, why is this? Because evil, crime and disease arethe result of the great heresy of separateness, and because hate and not lovecontrols. Forget not that he who loveth not his brother is a murderer—ever thesymbol of hate. As yet, the sense of universality and of identity with all isnot to be found, except in advanced disciples and initiates; the massconsciousness and the demonstration of the herd instinct must not be confoundedwith the sense of Oneness which marks the right oriented person. In the New Age,teaching anent the antahkarana and the constitution of man, principally from theangle of the “three periodical bodies,” and not so much from that of the lowerthreefold man, will be emphasised, particularly in the higher schools oflearning, thereby laying a sound foundation for the esoteric schools which willbe slowly emerging. A new perspective upon humanity will be thereby attained.The nature of the spiritual will will be taught in contradistinction to that ofthe selfish personal will; [547] by its means tremendous new potencies will bereleased, and safely released, into daily life.Up to the present time, even disciples have little idea of the exceeding powerof the triadal will. It might be here affirmed that those healers who havetriadal consciousness and can exercise the potency of the monadic life and will,via the Spiritual Triad, will always be successful healers; they will make nomistakes, for they will have accurate spiritual perception; this will give themknowledge as to the possibility of cure, and by the use of the will they canthen work safely and with power on the head centre of the patient. They willnecessarily confine their healing powers to those who live focussed in the head.They will stimulate the soul, there anchored, into effective activity, thuspromoting a true self-healing.You will note from all the above how relatively simple these Laws are whencarefully considered, and how beautifully they are related to each other. Themastering and grasping of one facilitates the understanding of the next.Forget not that the head centre is the one through which the will works, andwith this in your mind, relate the information given you anent Law One in theearly part of this instruction to that which I have here given you. If theselaws are studied deeply by those who seek to learn to heal spiritually, and ifthe healer endeavours to make his life conform to the rules, a definite patternof healing and an emerging technique will take shape in his mind and greatlyincrease his effective service. You will note also that I am not giving rulesand laws which deal with specific diseases. This, I fear, will greatlydisappoint many earnest workers. They would like me to indicate what should bedone, for instance, to cure cancer of the liver, or pneumonia or gastric ulceror forms of heart disease. This I do not intend to do. My work is far more basicthan that. I am concerned [548] with causes, and primarily with the etheric bodyas the distributor of energies or as the withholder of these energies whentransformed into forces; I deal with the state of consciousness of the healerand with the theories which he should embrace, with his understanding of therelationship of the soul to its vehicles of expression (particularly, in thecase of healing, to the vital body), and with the controlling fact of thecentres found in every area of the body, either freely distributing energy andpreserving the body in good health or—through undevelopment and inhibitedactivity—bringing about those conditions in which disease becomes possible andprobable.You can see, therefore, how the healing process is simplified when we recognisecauses and realise that they are responsible for the functioning of the body onthe outer plane. The healer has always to remember the following sequence offacts:1. The fact of the soul, working through2. The mind and the astral body, whose energies condition3. The etheric vehicle, a vortex of energies focussed through numerous centres,both major and minor.4. The seven major centres, controlling definite areas of the body viaa. The nadisb. The nerves.c. The endocrine systemd. The blood stream.These four groups of conditioned aspects of the man concern life andconsciousness, or the two major aspects of the soul when in manifestation uponthe physical plane.[549] Orthodox medicine has been to date necessarily confined to the objectivesymptoms and their immediate apparent cause, and therefore to effects and not toreal causes. The healing with which I am concerned is directed towards thereorganising and the revitalising of the etheric body, with the intent ofgetting behind the outer formal indications of wrong conditions to that vehicleof energies which—if correctly functioning and in right alignment—will preservethe physical body in good condition and keep it free from disease. The knowledgerequired by the healer in the New Age is therefore more basic and less detailed.He deals with areas and not with organs; he is concerned with energies and theirdistributing points, and not with the details of the physical body, with theconstruction of the organs and their malfunctioning. He will deal with the sevenetheric centres, with the nadis through which they affect and stimulate (apartfrom radiation) the nervous system; he will watch with care the nervous systemand the blood stream which the centres affect through radiation on to andthrough the hormones there to be found. But the keynote of all his work will bedirected distribution, and the centre of his attention will be the channels ofthis distribution—the entire system of etheric centres.I would beg you to reflect upon all this information with studious care. Thekeynote to good health, esoterically speaking, is sharing or distribution, justas it is the keynote to the general well-being of humanity. The economic ills ofmankind closely correspond to disease in the individual. There is lack of a freeflow of the necessities of life to the points of distribution; these points ofdistribution are idle: the direction of the distribution is faulty, and onlythrough a sane and worldwide grasp of the New Age principle of sharing willhuman ills be cured; only by the right distribution of energy will the ills ofthe physical body of individual [550] man also be cured . This is a fundamental(I would say the fundamental principle) of all spiritual healing. In the lastanalysis also this presupposes an eventual and scientific recognition of theetheric body of the planet, and consequently of man.We come now to a consideration of Rule One.RULE ONELet the healer train himself to know the inner stage of thought or of desire ofthe one who seeks his help. He can thereby know the source from whence thetrouble comes. Let him relate the cause and the effect and know the point exactthrough which relief must come.It will be apparent to you that the first rule which the healer has to mastermust necessarily be important. It is basic and essential in its implications ifa cure is to be effected or if the healer is not to waste time in attempting theimpossible. There are four injunctions in this rule:1. The healer must train himself to know whether the patient is mentally orastrally (emotionally) focussed.2. He can and must, therefore, ascertain the psychological basis of the existenttrouble.3. He will be able then to ascertain the location of the effect (the disease)through perception of the underlying cause.4. This will enable him to knowa. The area affected.b. The centre in the etheric body controlling that area.You will also realise why I started my analysis of disease and healing by apresentation of the psychological causes. [551] This first rule is related tothat entire section of the teaching and is, as you can see, intensely practical.When the personality polarisation is known, two major facts emerge: the point ofapproach will be either through the head centre or the heart centre if thepatient is highly developed—which presumably the healer can be supposed to knowfrom character indications and the effectiveness of his life. Or the approachcan be through the throat centre or the solar plexus centre if the patient is anordinary and average advanced person; if he is quite undeveloped and relativelya low grade human being, the exact point through which relief will come will bethe solar plexus centre or the sacral centre. It is interesting to note thatwhen a man is so low in the evolutionary scale that he must be ethericallyreached via the sacral centre, he is often quite easily cured and will respondmore rapidly to what is oft called “etheric manipulation” than will other types.One reason for this is that his mind and his emotions present no real obstacles,and all available energies can be directed unimpeded to the diseased area.If the healer is clairvoyant, he can with facility ascertain the point of entryof the healing forces, because the “entering light” will then be the brightest,the light of the centre itself will convey the needed information. If he is avery advanced healer, he will not use any form of psychic perception but willreact immediately upon contact to an impression so powerful, coming from thepatient, that it cannot be denied and is probably entirely correct and to bedepended upon. It must be remembered, however, that owing to the integrity ofthe human soul, and to the fact that every soul is in its own nature a Master,there will be always a margin of error where the healer is concerned, even if heis an initiate-healer; there will be evidence to him of a point where thespiritual man (of which the patient is only [552] a reflection) controls, andbeyond which—except as a soul on an equal basis with the patient’s soul—hecannot and dare not go. There are conditions, for instance, in which an advanceddisciple or a high initiate (for definite purpose of vacating his physicalvehicle) may be permitting the forces of disintegration, of limitation and ofdestruction to be breaking down and destroying his physical outer form. Whenthis is the case, the healer may not be aware of the intention; he will,however, be aware of opposition and will be forced to desist from his efforts toheal.When the patient is a strictly mental type, and the approach to the healingprocess must be through a higher centre, the head centre, the healer will bewise to gain the conscious cooperation of the patient so that their two willswill function in unison; this will entail a positive relationship between thetwo. When the patient is not so highly developed, the healer will have to strivefor a spirit of hopeful acquiescence in the man; the emotional nature will bestronger in this case than in the more advanced type and the task of the healerconsequently harder. He will have, very frequently, to combat anxiety, emotionalreactions of diverse kinds, fear and forebodings. The psychological conditionwill therefore be fluid, and the healer will have much to do to aid the patientto preserve a constancy of emotional reaction and to become calm and quiescent.This quiet reaction has to be attained if the healing energies are to passeffectively to the right centre and its controlled area. This can be broughtabout by the establishing of a harmonious rapport between the healer and thepatient, prior to any healing process. Healers in the New Age will alsoestablish their own clientele, just as physicians do today, and so learn to knowthe constitution and the temperament of those they may be called upon to help;they will also educate them in certain healing processes and techniques [553] inpreparation for their use later, if needed; this time, however, still lies farahead.When the patient is an undeveloped human being and low down in the evolutionaryscale, he will be controlled psychologically by the consecrated personality ofthe healer and by the imposition of the healers’ will upon the etheric body ofthe patient. This does not mean the imposition of the energy of the will upon anegative person, thereby impelling the patient to action and imperilling eventhe very small measure of freewill which he possesses; it means the impositionof the authority of knowledge and of spiritual stabilisation upon the patient,thereby instilling confidence and a willingness to be obedient.You have here the first steps which the healer must take in dealing with thepatient and with the psyche, the lower psyche of the patient. They are three innumber:1. Gaining the cooperation of the personality of the advanced man; it is onlythe personality which requires healing.2. Bringing about a condition of hopeful acquiescence on the part of thepersonality of the average man; he is not as yet capable of intelligentcooperation, but he can so handle himself that he reduces personality hindrancesto a minimum.3. Inducing confident obedience to the suggestions of the healer. This is allthat the undeveloped man can do.It will be obvious to you that broad generalisations such as the above do notcover every type of man and the many intermediate types and stages. The healerwill need to be a true lover of his fellowmen and a trained psychologist aswell; this means that he will have to practice as a soul and also as aperceptive mind.[554] Another point should here be noted. One problem which the healer will haveto face with mental types will be the tendency to preserve all energies comingfrom the soul either in the head, or at least above the diaphragm; this does notmean that all the areas of the body below the diaphragm are not habituallysupplied with the needed energies, but that there the functioning is largelyautomatic and the man is not in the habit of consciously directing energy to thecentre and the area it controls, when below the diaphragm. It may be necessaryto instruct him so to do, if he is attempting to collaborate with the healer andseeks to bring about a cure. His mental focus and the activity of the headcentre will be a great help, provided he accepts instruction in the art ofenergy direction. This he can usually do if not too ill or too preoccupied withthe preservation of a conscious contact with his body. When he is unable tofocus his attention, either through pain or through lack of physicalconsciousness or profound weakness, the healer will have to work primarily assoul with soul, and trust that the rapport between the patient’s soul and theetheric body will be adequate to promote a cure, if that is the destiny of theman.Where the source of the trouble lies in the emotional or astral body, the taskof the healer is not so easy; he has then to work, focussed as a soul in hishead centre, but directing the needed energy and controlling the patient’semotional nature via his correctly oriented solar plexus centre. I refer here tothe healer’s solar plexus centre, which is one which he does not as a generalrule employ as a point of focus or attention in his own life. The healer has agained facility in the use of all his centres at will, regarding them asdistributing points of directed energy. This directed energy, I would have younote, is not directed towards healing, but is the soul energy of the healerdirected towards [555] bringing some centre in the patient’s body under control,owing to the emotionalism which the patient displays, and towards reorganisingit as a centre for reception of the healing energies emanating from thepatient’s soul—a very different matter and one which must be most carefullyborne in mind.The healer, therefore, uses two centres, normally speaking: his own head centreand that centre in his own body which corresponds to the area which is diseasedand its controlling centre. There has to be in every successful healing theestablishing of a sympathetic relationship. As an ancient book in the Masters’Archives puts it: “Soul to soul, the two are one; point to point, together mustthey suffer; place to place, they find themselves allied, and thus the dualstream of energy results in cure.”One of the major difficulties with which the healer is faced, particularly ifrelatively inexperienced, is the result of this established sympatheticrelation. There is apt to occur what we might call “transference.” The healertakes on or takes over the condition of disease or discomfort, not in fact butsymptomatically. This can incapacitate him or at least intercept the freeactivity of the healing process. It is a glamour and an illusion and is based onthe healer’s achieved capacity to identify himself with his patient; it also isfounded on his anxiety and great desire to bring relief. The healer has becomeso preoccupied with the patient’s need, and so decentralised from his ownidentified and positive consciousness, that inadvertently he has become negativeand temporarily unprotected. The cure for this, if the healer discovers inhimself this tendency, is to work through the heart centre as well as the headcentre, and thus keep a steady flow of the positive energy of love pouring outtowards the patient. This will insulate him from the disease, but not from thepatient. He can do this by working [556] through the heart centre within thebrahmarandra (the head centre) and greatly increase the potency of his healingwork; however, it presupposes a high degree of development on the healer’s part.The average spiritual healer will have to link up head and heart centres by adefinite act of the will. He will then realise that the love pouring from him tothe patient will prevent any return of the undesirable emanations from thepatient which have been flowing towards him; this because if such a flowexisted, it would militate against the patient being healed.The healer who responds to the inner urge to heal will face, as you can see, avery severe course of training before his own equipment—personality, ethericbody and its centres—are brought into such submission to the soul that theyoffer no obstruction to the healing art. He has therefore to learn in connectionwith himself:1. Rapid alignment between soul, mind, head centre and physical brain.2. The use of the mind, illumined by the soul, in the psychological diagnosis ofthe causes of the disease which he proposes to handle.3. Methods for establishing a sympathetic rapport with the patient.4. Modes of protecting himself from any transference brought about through thisrapport.5. The establishing of a right relation with the patient of either cooperation,acquiescence or spiritual control.6. Physical diagnosis and the locating of the area to which relief must come,via the controlling centre.7. The art of cooperation with the patient’s soul so that his etheric bodyfocusses all its inflowing energies in order to bring relief to the diseasedarea. This involves the direct activity of the healer’s etheric body inconnection [557] with a renewed activity on the part of the patient’s ethericbody.8. The technique of withdrawing his healing power when that of the patient isadequate to the undertaking.I feel that I have here given you all that you need for immediate study andreflection. I have shown you that the healing art is not a vague mysticalprocess, or wishful thinking and simple good intentions. I have indicated thatit presupposes the mastering of the science of soul contact, first of all: theconstant practice of alignment, and the comprehension of the Science of theCentres, or—literally—a modern form of Laya-Yoga. Healers in the future willundergo years of drastic training, and this need cause no surprise, for theordinary medical profession calls for years of hard study and work. Many healersin the New Age will combine orthodox study and knowledge with the art ofspiritual healing.When trained healers, with perception, with a full working knowledge of theetheric body, with an understanding of the energies which compose it or which itdoes or can transmit, of the subtle constitution of man and of the methods ofdirecting energies from one point and location to another, can work with fullmedical knowledge or in full collaboration with the orthodox physician orsurgeon, then tremendous changes will be brought about. Great enlightenment willreach the race of man.It is for this that we must prepare—not primarily for the healing of thephysical body, but because of the expansion of the consciousness of the racethat this new and esoteric study will bring about.We have dealt with a number of fundamental realities which it is essential thatall healers—endeavouring to work with the new type of esoteric healing—mustmaster; what [558] I said, therefore, is of major importance. Each point made byme could form the basis of prolonged discussion, but (in this treatise) that isnot possible, for I seek only to give indication of future possibilities. I seekalso to foment distrust in the present approach of the metaphysical world tothis subject of disease and its cure, and to undermine—if I may use so drastican expression—the confidence of the public in the so-called New Age modes ofhealing, in the methods of the Christian Scientist, of Mental Science, and ofall those schools of thought which deal with healing from the angle ofaffirmation—affirmation of man’s divinity and the claim that that inherent andinnate divinity guarantees his healing. This claim is a glamour and a delusion,as I have oft sought to show.Today we deal with a law which (if properly understood) proves how inadequate isthe approach of the modern metaphysician to this subject and—though it puts ourinstructions on healing on a sound basis—it postpones the era of truly occulthealing quite definitely to a more distant time. This third law runs as follows:LAW IIIDisease is an effect of the basic centralisation of a man’s life energy. Fromthe plane whereon those energies are focussed proceed those determiningconditions which produce ill health. These, therefore, work out as disease or asfreedom from disease.This law indicates that one of the primary determinations at which the healermust arrive is that of the level of consciousness from which the predominatingenergy in the etheric body emanates. I would remind you here that in The SecretDoctrine , H.P.B. states that a plane and a state of consciousness aresynonymous terms, and entirely interchangeable; in all my writing I seek toemphasise not [559] the level of matter or substance (a plane, as it is called),but the consciousness which expresses itself in that environing area ofconscious substance.We are assured in this ancient law that disease is an elect of the basiccentralisation of a man’s life energy. This life energy is not the same as theenergy or force of consciousness, but consciousness is ever the directing factorin every expression of the indwelling life, for there is basically only onemajor energy—life energy. Where the consciousness of the man is focussed, therethe life energy will gather its forces. If the consciousness is focussed on themental plane or upon the astral plane, the life energy will not be so stronglyfocussed and anchored in the heart centre (the centre where the life principleis found), but only a part of its vital energy will find its way into thephysical body, via the etheric vehicle. The greater part will be retained (touse an inadequate word) upon the plane where the consciousness is predominantlyfunctioning or—to word it otherwise—it will be conditioned in expression by thestate of consciousness, corresponding to that level of awareness or place ofcontact with the divine Whole or the divine Consciousness which the point inevolution of the man makes possible.The task of the healer is therefore to find out where this focus ofconsciousness is to be found; this brings us back to a point I made anent thepatient being essentially either a mental or an emotional type, and very, veryrarely indeed purely physical in his consciousness. Where the consciousness isstabilised in that of the soul, there will be little disease present and thephysical difficulties of the highly developed patient will then be associatedwith the impact of the soul energy upon an unready physical vehicle; at thatstage only certain of the major diseases will affect him. He will not besusceptible to the little complaints and the [560] constant small infectionswhich render the life of the average man or of the undeveloped man so trying anddifficult. He may suffer from heart trouble, from nervous diseases, and fromcomplaints affecting the upper part of the body and those areas which arecontrolled by the centres above the diaphragm; however, the difficulties broughtabout through the minor etheric centres (of which there are many), or by thecentres below the diaphragm, will not usually be present—unless (as can be thecase in a very advanced disciple) he is deliberately taking on conditionsengendered by his world service for men.As the majority of human beings are at this time centralised on the astral plane(or in the astral body), a clue to one of the greatest sources of diseaseimmediately becomes apparent. When the consciousness of the race shifts on tothe mental plane—and this is slowly taking place—then the more widely known andprevalent diseases will die out and only the diseases of mental types or thediseases of disciples will remain to disturb the peace of individual man. Withthese I have dealt in an earlier volume of this treatise. (A Treatise on theSeven Rays, Vol. II, Page 520-625)Mental Science is right in its recognition that it is the emotions of men (asexpressed in that feeble imitation of reality which they call thought) which areresponsible for much disease. They are right in their effort to make the patientchange his emotional attitudes and to react to life and circumstances and peoplealong a different line. But they are hopelessly wrong in believing that that issufficient; in their ignoring of all scientific procedures connected with theetheric body, they have nothing which relates the emotional nature to thephysical vehicle, and therefore there is a gap in their reasoning and aconsequent fault in their [561] technique. This renders their activities futile,except from the character angle. When they do bring about a healing, it isbecause in any case the patient was predestined to recover, but they have serveda useful purpose in correcting a character condition in which he was in constantdanger of disease. They have not wrought a cure, and in claiming it both thehealer and the patient are deceived. All deception is dangerous and hindering.It might be of service here if I indicate along broad and general lines some ofthe types of disease which a centralisation of the life force upon the astralplane, for instance, could produce. I shall but list them; I will not deal withthem in any detail for until the modern healer recognises the fact of theetheric body , and works scientifically and intelligently with it and itscontrolling centres of force, anything I could say of procedure would be futile.I am endeavouring at this time to promote certain basic acceptances—such as thefact of the existence of the etheric body.1. Constant introspection, all forms of morbid suppression and a too drasticallyenforced silence where fundamental emotions are concerned can lead to seriousliver trouble, to constant gastric difficulties and to cancer.2. Where hatreds and deep dislike are present in the consciousness, or where theman lives in a constant state of irritation against a person or a group, oragain where the sense of being abused is present, there is a real possibilitythat the blood stream will be affected: the man then will be susceptible toconstant infections, to boils, to running sores and to the various bloodconditions which are definitely septic in nature.3. An irritable nature and one which is always in a state of fussiness, of badtemper, one which reacts furiously when things do not go as desired, may lead todisastrous [562] explosions which can be diagnosed as brain difficulties andtemporary insanities; they may lead to constant headaches which undermine theconstitution and bring about an inevitably debilitated condition.4. A frustrated sex life or a state wherein an unmarried person has had nonormal expression of a natural and universal process, and to whom therefore sexremains a mystery (and at the same time a constant inner unrecorded subject ofthought) will lead:a. To a condition of great devitalisation with a consequent and unavoidable illhealth which attends that type of person—the so-called obvious old maid orbachelor. Needless to remark, there are many such unmarried people who face lifewholesomely and do not come under this category.b. To a constant effort to attract the attention of the opposite sex until itreaches a point where it becomes a nervous and most unwholesome tendency.c. To the development of homosexual habits or to those perversions which warpthe life of many intelligent people.d. To the tumours—malignant or otherwise—which attack the organs of generationand which frequently make the subject an operative case.There are other possible developments but upon them I do not propose to dwell. Ihave here indicated enough to show the danger of a sense of frustration and amorbid (even if at the time an unrecognised) interest in sex. This can evidenceitself also in a dream life which links the brain, the mind and the organs ofgeneration closely together and proves the fact of astral desire evoking thephysical appetite; this demonstrates my contention that the physical bodyautomatically responds—[563] even when unconscious in the hours of sleep—toastral control. The cure, as you of course know, is a full creative outer life,particularly one which is of benefit to one’s fellowmen and is not simply atransmutation of the sex urge into some form of creative thinking which simplyremains thinking, but takes no shape or form on the outer plane of human life.5. Self-pity, so prevalent a trouble, leads to acute indigestion, to intestinaltrouble, to catarrh and head colds in the average person, whilst in the moreadvanced man it leads to chronic bronchial difficulties, gastric ulcers andunhealthy conditions connected with the teeth and the ears.I could go on enumerating other emotional conditions which produce disease inthe person where these conditions are present but this will suffice to give theexperimenting healer a clue to certain possibilities which are responsible forthe physical difficulties with which he is called upon to deal. We will havealso (as I have pointed out elsewhere) to bear in mind conditions which havebeen inherited from previous incarnations or developed as a result of environinggroup, national or planetary karma.There is no rule connected with this law because we are still dealing with thedefinition of causes producing the objective disease; these have to be graspedand accepted as working theories before the healer can efficiently deal with thesituation.We come now to the consideration of a law which is so inclusive in itssignificance and in its defining power that it might be regarded as stating thereason for all disease of any nature and at any time in the life history of therace or of individual man. It is stated here and is only regarded as Law IVbecause of the necessity for the main contentions [564] of the three precedinglaws being admitted, considered and studied; also because it is the major lawconditioning the appearance of disease in the fourth kingdom in nature, thehuman kingdom. It is essentially a law related to the fourth Creative Hierarchy,and it was definitely imposed and recognised as a law, governing humanitypredominantly, by initiates working in the fourth rootrace, the Atlantean.Curiously enough also when humanity can function with its consciousness centredupon the fourth or buddhic plane, disease will die out and the fourth CreativeHierarchy will finally be freed from that great limitation.LAW IVDisease, both physical and psychological, has its roots in the good, thebeautiful, and the true. It is but a distorted reflection of divinepossibilities. The thwarted soul, seeking full expression of some divinecharacteristic or inner spiritual reality, produces—within the substance of itssheaths—a point of friction. Upon this point the eyes of the personality arefocussed, and this leads to disease. The art of the healer is concerned with thelifting of the downward focussed eyes unto the soul, the true Healer within theform. The spiritual or third eye then directs the healing force, and all iswell.This law starts off with the statement of one of the paradoxes of the occultteaching: that good and evil are one and the same thing, though in reverse, orconstituting the opposite sides of the one Reality.Because man is a soul, and is spiritually determined to function as a soul, astate of friction is established between soul and personality; this friction isa major cause (if it is not the major cause) of all disease. Here is a clue tothe understanding of the phrase, “fire by friction,” the third aspect of thedivine “fiery nature” of God, for “our God is a consuming fire\". His nature, weare told also, is expressed [565] through electric fire , through solar fire andthrough fire by friction. These three fires I dealt with at length in A Treatiseon Cosmic Fire and hinted at earlier in The Secret Doctrine.This law states that because man is divine, the urge to divinity producesresistance in the vehicles of expression; this resistance will localise itselfin the area of the physical body and produce a point of friction; this friction,in its turn, produces a condition or an area of inflammation. This eventuallyleads to disease of some kind or another. It is possible, is it not, that youhave here another clue—a clue to a problem which has caused so much concern inthe metaphysical world: Why do advanced people, spiritual leaders and thoseoriented to the spiritual life, suffer so frequently from physical difficulties?It is probably because they are at the stage where the energy of the soul,pouring through the physical body, meets resistance from that body of acorrespondingly intense kind. This friction set up is so acute that disease ispromptly the result. This is not true of disciples who have taken the secondinitiation; their problem of ill health is otherwise developed.Let us take this fourth law sentence by sentence and attempt somewhat to analysethe meaning:1. Disease, both physical and psychological, has its roots in the good, thebeautiful and the true. This is but a distorted reflection of divinepossibilities.I have shown that disease is fundamentally psychological in nature. there are,however, diseases which are inherent in the resistance of the dense physicalbody (and not only the subtler bodies) to the impact of the higher energies, orwhich are inherent in the planetary substance or matter of the Earth itself.Forget not that the physical body is constructed of such matter. This firstclause of the fourth [566] law tells us that three aspects of divinity producedisease. This sounds impossible upon first reading the statement, but a carefulstudy will reveal its essential truthfulness. How can the good, the beautifuland the true, cause disease of any kind? Let us see.a. The Good. What is the good? Is it not the expression of the will-to-good?Does not and should not this will-to-good work out on the physical plane in whatwe call goodwill among men? Is it not possible that the soul, seeking constantly(on its own plane) to conform to the Plan which implements the divinewill-to-good, endeavours to impel its threefold expression, the personality, toexpress goodwill—doing this at the right stage of evolutionary unfoldment andwhen it is active and functioning? Yet, because of the resistance of the formnature, as yet inadequate to the desired divine expression, friction immediatelyset up and disease eventuates. I think that even a brief consideration of theabove questions will demonstrate to you how probable it is that the soul’sinclination to “the good” can bring about resistance upon the physical plane sothat the turmoil thus engendered in the consciousness of man can and doesproduce disease. This type of disease is responsible for many of thedifficulties of advanced people, aspirants and disciples. This “friction”produces then a secondary reaction and leads to those psychological conditionsto which we give the name “depression, an inferiority complex, and the sense offailure.” This particular source of disease, “the Good,” is one that primarilyaffects the mental types.b. The Beautiful . Here you have a word qualifying the desire of all men forwhat they consider a desirable objective for their life pattern and that forwhich they [567] choose to struggle. The beautiful, from the angle of a divineaspect, concerns the quality of life. I would refer you here to our initialdefinition in the first volume of this treatise of the words spirit-soul-body;we defined them as life-quality-appearance. Life is the energy in expression ofthe divine will-to-good; quality is the energy in expression of the soul, andthis energy works at this time predominantly through the desire life and thedetermination of all men at every stage in evolution to possess, own and enjoythat which they regard as the beautiful. A definition of “the beautiful” and therange of man’s desires are widely different and dependent upon the point inevolution; it is all dependent however, upon the outlook on life of the one whois desiring and the place where he stands upon the ladder of evolution. Theinability of man to achieve at any time what he considers “the beautiful”determines his predisposition to disease, based upon the internal friction thusproduced. At the present point in racial development, the majority of people areswept into diseased conditions as a result of the friction brought about bytheir striving after “the beautiful”—a striving enforced as an evolutionary urgebecause they are souls and under the influence of the quality of the seconddivine aspect.c. The True . It has been said that the true or the truth is that much of thedivine expression as any man can demonstrate at his particular point inevolution and at any given stage in his incarnated history. This expression ofthe truth presupposes that behind what he does manage to express there is muchthat he is unable to manifest; of this his soul remains persistently aware. Thisinability to live up to the highest ideal of which the man—at his particularlevel—is aware and can conceive, in his clearest and best moments, producesinevitably [568] a point of friction, even if the man remains unaware of it. Oneof the major manifestations of this particular friction and the diseasedcondition which it brings about is rheumatism; this is widespread today and hasbeen for centuries; from the medical standpoint, there is no ascertained orattributable cause for it, though there are many speculations and conclusionsamong the orthodox. It affects primarily the bony structure and is in realitythe result or the inability of the soul to produce an expression of “the true”within the man, the instrument of the soul in the three worlds. The man, in histurn, no matter how low his position on the ladder of evolution, is consciousever of the unattainable; he is constantly aware of an urge to betterment. Theseurges are not related to the expression of the will-to-good or to “thebeautiful” (though he may be conscious of them also to a greater or lessdegree), but they are definitely related to the expression of something closerto the man’s ideal as he sees it, and upon the physical plane. Friction,therefore, takes place and disease of some kind follows.It is interesting to note that this inability to express “the true” or to “bethe Truth” is the real cause of death among men who are below the stage ofdiscipleship and who have not yet taken the first initiation. The soul tires ofthe frictional response of its instrument and determines to end the experimentof that particular incarnation. Death, therefore, supervenes as a result of thefriction engendered.In studying these ideas, it should be remembered that:a. The good controls the man, via the head centre, and the friction engenderedis due to the inactivity of the centre at the base of the spine. This centrecontrols the expression [569] of the first divine aspect in a man by itsinterplay with the head centre. This interplay only takes place when the man hasreached the stage of disciple or initiate.b. The beautiful controls, via the heart centre, and friction is brought aboutby the failure of the solar plexus centre to respond. A condition of friction istherefore set up. The ending of this condition and the evocation of the rightresponse from the solar plexus come when the forces of the solar plexus centreare raised and blended with the energy of the heart centre.c. The true , as an expression of the divine, finds its point of centralisationin the throat centre; the failure of the personality to respond, and itsinability to express the true, is to be seen in the relation of the sacralcentre to the throat centre. This relation, when lacking, produces friction.There will be no real expression of “the true” until the forces of the creativecentre below the diaphragm are raised to the creative centre of the throat. Then“the Word,” which is man essentially, “will be made flesh” and a true expressionof the soul upon the physical plane will be seen.2. The thwarted soul, seeking full expression of some divine characteristic orinner spiritual reality, produces within the substance of its sheaths a point offriction.Much of this statement I have covered above. I would, however, call yourattention to the fact that in this sentence the emphasis is laid upon the factthat it is the soul which is responsible for producing the friction. In theanalysis of the previous sentence, the emphasis was laid upon the personality,because its failure to respond produced the friction and consequent disease. Isit not possible that in this sentence [570] we have the clue to the entirepurpose of pain, of distress, and even of war? I would commend this to yourcareful and, if possible, illumined thinking.3. Upon this point, the eyes of the personality are focussed, and this leads todisease.We have here a most interesting hint as to the medium of force direction. Theoccult significance of the eye and the nature of its symbolism are littleunderstood. The reference here has nothing to do in reality with eyes in thephysical body. Here the words, “the eyes of the personality,” refer to thefocussed attention of the personality, emanating from the mental and astralbodies which are essentially the two eyes of the soul in incarnation. The use ofthese two windows or eyes of the soul leads to a concentration of energy (inthis case strictly personality energy) in the etheric vehicle. This energy isthen directed to the area of discomfort, and therefore to the point of friction.This friction is sustained and increased by the forces which are focussed uponit. People have little idea how much—objectively speaking—they increase thepotency of the disease by the constantly directed thought which they expend uponit and by the attention they pay to that area wherein the trouble is located.Energies, mental and emotional, are brought to bear upon the diseased area, andthe “eyes of the personality” are a potent factor in sustaining the disease.In this sentence you have, moreover, a clear and unequivocal expression of thefact that mental and emotional conditions lead to disease. The activity of thesoul and the impact of soul energy have to penetrate into the physical body, viathe subtler bodies, and the point of friction (the outcome of resistance) isfound first of all in the mental body, then is repeated even more potently inthe astral body, and is reflected into the physical body; these (and this is[571] the a b c of occultism but is sometimes forgotten) constitute thepersonality, and the friction is necessarily to be found throughout.It might be of interest to you to correlate what I have said in my other writinganent the eyes with the point made above. As you well know, and as stated in TheSecret Doctrine, the right eye is the “eye of buddhi” and the left eye is the“eye of manas”—this (when in relation to buddhi) referring to the higher mindand to man as he finally will appear. In the average human being, and beforereaching perfection, the right eye transmits the energy of the astral body whendirected consciously towards an object of attention, and the left eye directsthe energy of the lower mind. In between these two directing eyes is to be foundthe ajna centre, which is like a third eye or directing agent for the blendedand fused energies of the personality; related to this third eye as it awakensand comes into functioning activity is what we call “the eye of the soul”; thisis a point within the highest head centre. This eye of the soul can and doestransmit energy to the ajna centre and is itself the agent (before the fourthinitiation) of the energy of the Spiritual Triad. This esoteric relationship isonly set up when the soul is dominating its instrument, the personality, and isbringing all the lower activities upon the physical plane under soul direction.In the perfected man, there is to be found, therefore, the followingdistributors or distributing agents of energy:1. The eye of the soul . . agent of the Spiritual Triad . . Will.2. The third eye . . agent of the soul . . Love.3. The right eye . . distributor of buddhic energy.4. The left eye . . conveyor of pure manasic energy.5. The ajna centre . . focussing and directing point for all these energies.[572] In the disciple and the man who is beginning to function as a soul, youwill have:1. The third eye . . .distributor of soul energy.2. The right eye . . .agent for astral energy.3. The left eye . . .agent for lower mental energy.4. The ajna centre . . .focussing point of these three energies.In the average man, the situation will be as follows:1. The right eye . . .agent for astral energy.2. The left eye . . .agent for mental energy.3. The ajna centre . . .distributing station.As occult knowledge increases a whole science of energy distribution will bebuilt up around the eyes and their symbolic function, and their esoteric usewill be understood. The time has not yet arrived for this, though already thepower of the human eye when focussed on a person, for instance, is known toattract attention. One hint I can give you: the optic nerve is a symbol of theantahkarana, and the entire structure of the eye ball is one of the mostbeautiful symbols of the threefold deity and the threefold man.4. The art of the healer is concerned with the lifting of the downward focussedeyes unto the soul, the true healer within the form.In its most obvious and lowest connotation this phrase simply says that thehealer must help the patient to look away from himself, that he must aid him toraise and reorient the directed energy so that the “point of friction” is nolonger the object of attention and a new preoccupation is presented. This haslong been the attempted practice of all healers but it has a far more esotericmeaning than [573] they have realised and one which I find it somewhat difficultto explain.We have seen that the point of friction (responsible for the disease) has beencaused by the good, the beautiful and the true in conflict with the forces ofthe lower man. This, we have also seen, is a fundamental law and one which heknows he must accept and with which he must intelligently work. How, therefore,can he apply this law and produce the results for which he is striving?These downpouring energies of the soul enter the physical body, via the ethericvehicle, and are responsible for the frictional trouble and its consequence,disease; they have “descended into contact” via the sutratma and are anchored inthree main centres, major centres, as you well know. From these, according to aman’s nature, ray, development and weaknesses and limitations, they aredistributed to the various areas of the physical body and either cause points offriction or manifest themselves as divine qualities. Where friction andresultant disease are present, and the patient is fortunate to have a trainedoccult healer available (either an initiate or an advanced disciple), theseenergies will be sent back—either with or without the cooperation of thepatient—to their distributing points, the three higher centres, and thisaccording to the type of energy which is producing the trouble. They cannot besent out of the body altogether, via the head centre, for in that case the manwould die; but they can be esoterically “driven to their point of emanation,from the point of friction, but not to their Source,” as an ancient book onhealing states.The energy is sent from the infected area (to use an unsuitable word but we lackthe correct words for these new sciences) into the point of friction and fromthence to the centre which controls that area and by means of which soul energyentered the dense physical body. The [574] healer is therefore working with thetwo aspects of the physical body simultaneously—the dense and the etheric. Fromthat centre, the energy involved is gathered up and returned to one or other ofthe three major centres, or (if one of these higher centres is itself involved)the energy is gathered up and driven into the head centre and there retained. Itmust therefore be borne in mind that this phase of the healer’s work falls intotwo parts:1. The stage of esoteric “lifting up” or “driving forth.” This itself falls intotwo phases:a. The phase of gathering the energy.b. The phase of refocussing it in its distributing centre.2. The stage after the healer’s work has been accomplished and the patient iseither better or the work has not been successful. In this stage, the energywhich has been “driven forth” is returned to the centre and the locality wherethe point of friction had been.It will be obvious to you that this form of healing work is possible only to thehighly trained person, and it is therefore needless for me to elaborate furtheron this technique. It is useful nevertheless to see at times the distant goals.All that is at present possible in reference to this statement is to turn thepatient’s attention (if he is capable of responding to suggestions) towards thesoul, and help him, with simplicity to hold his consciousness as close to thesoul as he can. This will aid in clearing the channels down which energy canflow, and also along which energy can be automatically withdrawn, because energyfollows thought.In the last analysis, true esoteric healing is a simple matter in comparisonwith the intricate and complex detail [575] anent the human mechanism and itsdiseases with which the modern physician has to cope. The spiritual healerconcerns himself with the area in which the disease is to be found, with itscontrolling etheric centre and its higher correspondence, and with the threeenergies coming from the soul which are responsible for producing the point orpoints of friction. The remainder of his work involves the use the creativeimagination, the power to visualise and a knowledge of scientific thinking,based upon the fundamental and universal law that “energy follows thought.” Thisvisualisation and this scientific thinking do not (where healing is concerned)involve the construction of thoughtforms. It involves the ability to move anddirect energy currents.5. The third eye then directs the healing force, and all is well.The third eye referred to here is that of the healer and not that of the averagepatient; this the healer uses in conjunction with the eye of the soul. In thecase of the healing of a very advanced person who is consciously able tocooperate, the third eye of the patient can also be active, and by this meanstwo very potent streams of directed energy can penetrate into the area where thepoint of friction is located. In ordinary cases, however, and where no occultknowledge is present on the part of the patient, the healer does all the work,and this is desirable. The cooperation of the unskilled and those emotionallyinvolved in their trouble is of no true assistance.The few hints given in the analysis of the sentences composing Law IV willprovide much food for thought, and we will now proceed to consider the ruleconnected with this law.It should be remembered, as we study these laws and rules, that the laws areimposed upon the healer and provide [576] the unalterable conditions under whichhe must work; he may not and cannot evade them. The rules, however, he imposesupon himself, and they constitute the conditions which he is advised to followif he seeks success. Much depends upon his understanding of the rules and on hisability to interpret them correctly. They are a translation or an adaptation ofthe ancient rules which have, since time began, conditioned all occult healers,working under hierarchical impression. In the early days of their use they weresubmitted to and accepted by members of the Hierarchy at that time—the time orage of ancient Lemuria—and had then to be interpreted differently to the moderninterpretation; the modern meaning is only now in process of emerging. It mightbe said that:1. In Lemurian times these rules were accepted by members of the Hierarchy.Unless you were a member you could not ascertain them or work with them.2. In Atlantean times they were externalised to the extent that disciples whowere not yet initiates or who had taken only the first initiation were giventhem and permitted to use them. It is their Atlantean interpretation whichlargely colours the modern approach to their comprehension, but it is notadequate to the opportunity and the more mental type of human being.3. Today, in our Aryan race, a new significance is emerging, and it is thatsignificance and the new interpretation which I shall endeavour to impart.Rule I was not subjected to the new interpretation because it was so obviouslymodern in its implications. In fact, the first rule was not part of the originalancient text from which these important rules have been taken, but is relativelyvery modern, being formulated early in the Christian [577] era. It is a clearand concise rule and implies what should be the nature of the healer’s thinking.1. He must know the type of thought which conditions the patient.2. He must be able to penetrate to the source of the difficulty, or to itspsychological background; therefore, he must use thought power.3. He must be able to relate cause and effect; the relating agent is ever themind.In old Lemuria and Atlantis the mind was practically entirely quiescent and notreally functioning at all; it is only in this present race that the mentalnature of man is becoming dominant, and therefore the new and moderninterpretation of these rules (based on the mind principle) is now in order, andwith this we shall proceed to deal.RULE TWOThe healer must achieve magnetic purity, through purity of life. He must attainthat dispelling radiance which shows itself in every man when he has linked thecentres in the head. When this magnetic field is established the radiation thengoes forth.The East has ever emphasised magnetic purity but has totally ignored physicalpurity as the Occident understands it; the West has emphasised external physicalpurity but knows nothing about magnetic purity; this latter is largely based(somewhat erroneously though not entirely so) on the effect of the auricemanation and its purity or non-purity. The healer, in this rule, is advised to:1. Achieve magnetic purity through purity of life.2. Attain a dispelling radiance through linking the centres in the head.[578] 3. Establish a magnetic field through the utilisation of this magneticfield.Result: RADIATION.The interesting part of this rule is its linking the two possible forms ofspiritual healing—radiatory and magnetic—into one activity. The true healerautomatically blends both modes of healing and uses both methods simultaneouslyand automatically because he works through the magnetic area, contained withinthe radius of influence of the three head centres, or within the triangle whichis formed by so linking them.In Lemurian days, the healer achieved his ends by the use of drastic physicaldisciplines, thus gaining the needed purity. The goal, as you know, ofhierarchical effort in those days was to teach primitive man the uses andpurpose of the physical body and its intelligent control; the man who masteredthe body and was in control of it as a machinist is in control of a machine, wasthen regarded as an initiate. Today, it is mastering the personality which makesa man an initiate. Celibacy, careful modes of eating, and bodily cleanliness,plus the rudiments of Hatha Yoga (embryonic physical, athletic control—muscularcontrol primarily) were strictly emphasised. This achieved, so-called puritypermitted the free flow of the pranic currents from the healer to the patient,via the sacral centre and the throat centre—the spiritual healer working throughthe throat centre, and the point of reception in the patient being the sacralcentre; neither the heart nor the head centres were used. Prana, to define itfor your purposes, is the vitality of the planet, its vital emanation; it isthis prana which is distributed or transferred by a natural healer (one withoutany training, without much essential knowledge or with little, if any, spiritual[579] orientation). He heals but does not know how or why; prana simply flowsthrough him in the form of a strong current of animal vitality, usually from thesplenic centre and not from any of the seven centres.These drastic physical disciplines are often attempted today by well-intentionedaspirants; they practice celibacy, strict vegetarianism, relaxation exercisesand many kinds of physical exercises, in the hope of bringing the body undercontrol. These forms of discipline would be very good for the undeveloped andthe lowest type of human being, but they are not the methods which should beemployed by the average man or the practising aspirant. Concentration upon thephysical body only serves to enhance its potency and to feed its appetites andbring to the surface of consciousness that which should be securely secludedbelow the threshold of consciousness. The true aspirant should be occupied withemotional, not physical, control and with the effort to focus himself upon themental plane prior to achieving a stabilised contact with the soul.In Atlantean times, the shift of the attention from the dense physical body tothe emotional vehicle began slowly to be made. The initiate of that time beganto teach his disciples that the physical body was in reality only an automaton,and that it was the desire body, and the nature and quality of their habitualdesires which should be considered if purity was to be attained. It was in thisrace, therefore, that personal magnetism first began slowly to show itself. Theearly and the primitive Lemurian was not in the least magnetic as we understandthe word, but in Atlantean days a certain measure of magnetic radiation showeditself, though not to the extent which is now frequent and possible. The firstdim outline of the halo could be seen around the heads of advanced Atlanteans.Magnetic purity became a possibility and a goal, but was dependent uponemotional [580] control and the purification of the desire nature; this producedautomatically a much greater measure of purity in the dense physical vehiclethan the Lemurian initiate ever achieved. Diseases of the body became bothsubtle and complex, and the first psychological diseases appeared and thevarious ills which are definitely based upon the emotions. With this type ofdifficulty we have dealt in an earlier part of this treatise. The healer inthose days worked through the solar plexus centre and (if an initiate) throughthe heart. There was still no magnetic area or field of energy in the head.Today, in our Aryan race, magnetic purity is not dependent upon the physicaldisciplines; it is still—for the mass of the people—dependent upon emotionaldisciplines, but in the case of the true healer in the New Age it is dependentupon the “lighted magnetic area in the head.” This provides a field of activityfor the soul, working through the head centres and focussing itself in themagnetic field which they enclose. When all the powers of the body and thedirected attention of the healer are centered in the head, and when the astralbody is quiescent and the mind is active as a transmitter of soul energy to thethree head centres, you then have an established radiance, or energy emanationwhich is a potent force in healing. The radiation is intense, not so much fromthe familiar aspect of light, but from the extent of its emanating rays ofactive energy which can reach the patient and energise the needed centre. Allthe centres in the body of the patient can be receptive to this energy, and notjust one, as in the previous two types of healing.When the karma or life-pattern of the patient permits, these energy rays(emanating from the magnetic field in the healer’s head) become what is called a“dispelling radiance”; they can drive away the forces which create or [581]aggravate the disease. When this dispelling radiance is unable (because of thedestiny of the patient) to bring about a physical cure, it can nevertheless beturned to the dispelling of subtler difficulties, such as fear in some form orother, emotional imbalance and certain psychological difficulties which greatlyenhance the problem with which the patient is faced.Healers would do well to remember that when the three centres in the head arelinked up and the magnetic field is therefore set up and the radiance ispresent, the healer can then use the ajna centre as the directing agent for this“dispelling radiance.” It is interesting to note that the two major centres inthe head (corresponding to atma-buddhi, or the soul) are the head centre and thealta major centre, and that these correspond esoterically to the distributingagents of the right and the left eyes, as do the two glands in the head: thepineal gland and the pituitary body. You have, therefore, in the head threetriangles, of which two are distributors of energy and the third is adistributor of force.[Image00015.jpg][582] It is with these triangles that the trained healer eventually works andwhich he consciously employs. The time when this will be possible still liesvery far ahead. At present the healer must work through visualisation and thepower of the creative imagination. As he imagines, through visualisation, therelationship of these interlaced triangles, superimposing them the one upon theothers, beginning with the first, he is doing a definite work of creativeplacing, then of creative vitalising and finally of creative directing. In thesethree words: placing, vitalising, directing, you have the results indicated asto what obedience to this rule will enable the healer to accomplish. Theattention is placed; the magnetic field is spiritually vitalised; the generatedvital radiance is then distributed and directed correctly through the medium ofthe third triangle. This sounds a somewhat complicated procedure but after alittle practice this healing exercise of placing, vitalising and directingbecomes an almost instantaneous and automatic accomplishment.We come now to the consideration of a long and somewhat complicated law and onewhich attempts to cover so much ground that at first reading it is apt to beconfusing.LAW VThere is naught but energy, for God is Life. Two energies meet in man, but otherfive are present. For each is to be found a central point of contact. Theconflict of these energies with forces and of forces twixt themselves producethe bodily ills of man. The conflict of the first and second persists for agesuntil the mountain top is reached—the first great mountain top. The fightbetween the forces produces all disease, all ills and bodily pain which seekrelease in death. The two, the five and thus the seven, plus that which theyproduce, possess the secret. This is the fifth law of healing within the worldof form.[583] It has been impossible hitherto to give the subject-matter of this lawbecause it is only today that teaching anent LIFE (and life as energy) has beenpossible. Also the teaching anent the five and the two energies which meet inman have only lately been given out by me, for the first time in any detail,although they were hinted at in The Secret Doctrine . I wonder sometimes if anyof you realise the epoch-making importance of the teaching which I have givenout anent the seven rays as manifesting energies. Speculations as to the natureof the divine Trinity have ever been present in the discussions and thinking ofadvanced men—and that since time began and the Hierarchy started its agelongtask of influencing and stimulating the human consciousness—but informationanent the seven Spirits before the Throne of the Trinity has not been so usualand only a few writers, ancient or modern, have touched upon the nature of theseBeings. Now, with all that I have given you concerning the seven rays and theseven Ray Lords, much more can be discovered; these seven great Lives can beseen and known as the informing essences and the active energies in all that ismanifested and tangible upon the physical plane as well as on all the planes ofdivine expression; in saying this, I include not only the cosmic physical plane(composed of our seven systemic planes) but the cosmic astral and the cosmicmental planes also.In this rule the healer is expected to accept certain basic ideas which willserve to develop his understanding; certain broad and general axioms are laiddown which will form a sound foundation for all future work. The main point tobear in mind is that this rule relates entirely to the physical plane (dense andetheric) and to the effects which the conflict between the energies and theforces produces within the physical body. The forces are those energies whichare limited and imprisoned within a form of any kind—a body, [584] a plane, anorgan, a centre; the energies are those streams of directed energy which makeimpact upon these imprisoned forces (if I may so call them) from within agreater or more inclusive form, from a subtler plane, thus making contact with agrosser vibratory force. An energy is subtler and more potent than the forceupon which it makes impact or establishes contact; the force is less potent butit is anchored . In these last two words you have the key to the problem of therelationship of energies. Free energy, from the angle of the anchored point ofcontact, is in some ways less effective (within a limited sphere) than theenergy already anchored there. It is essentially more potent but not effective.Ponder on this and let me illustrate my point. In the life of the aspirant, theenergy of the solar plexus centre (from long use, centralisation and habit) ismore potent in its effect upon the life of the aspirant than is the energy ofthe heart centre, which is only slowly, very slowly, coming into effectiveaction. To illustrate further: the energies of the personality are far morepotent in conditioning the life of the average man than is the energy of thesoul, which for aeons has tried to grasp effectively its point of manifestation,the personality, but has failed until very late in the cycle of incarnations.Yet, in the last analysis, heart energy and soul energy are infinitely morepotent than those of the solar plexus centre or the personality. For aeons,however, the energy of the heart centre and the energy of the soul have lackedresponsive vehicles in the three worlds.In a way, this simplifies the problem of the healer, because the first thing hehas to decide is whether soul energy or personality energy is in control; thatis a matter very simply discovered. The life trend of the patient, his mode ofliving or of service, the character he displays, are all indicative of thepotencies which control his manifested expression. If the man is a true aspirantand is aiming [585] consciously to tread the Path of Discipleship, he will aidthe discovery by frank admission; however, if there is no response from thepersonality forces to the soul impact of the healer, the personality will remainunaware of the opportunity and quite unconscious of the impact. These conditionsthe healer can therefore easily ascertain.This law is a long one and contains statements of major importance. It would beprofitable for us, in the interests of our subject, to study them with theutmost care and so become aware of their significance and true meaning; thisunderstanding must be from the standpoint of the initiate-consciousness, and notfrom the angle of vision of the average or unillumined man. We will, therefore,take each sentence by itself and seek its meaning. There are seven statementscontained in this law, and much of their import is exoterically familiar to you,but can be restated in relation to the healing art.1. There is naught but energy, for God is Life.This is a broad generalisation which may convey much to the initiate butassuredly conveys very little to the average thinker, to whom life meansessentially and simply that which calls into manifestation a form, whichsustains it in being and constantly demonstrates its presence by activity ofsome kind or another—an activity which demonstrates its livingness. We, however,erroneously apply the term living to the ability of a form to manifest andexpress its quality and nature. Yet livingness and quality exist apart from formand often come into major expression and usefulness through the application ofthe Law of Death.The fact of divinity and of divine origin is proved by the fact of life. This isoft overlooked, and the emphasis is put upon the concept that life evokes andsupports a form [586] which anchors the life-essence and proves the reality ofits existence.It is the life of the One Source of all manifesting forms which createsrelationships and essential qualities, and though this has been affirmedceaselessly it still remains a meaningless platitude. As men, however, begin torecognise God as energy and themselves as aspects of that energy, as they beginconsciously to work with energies and recognise the distinction in time andspace between energies and forces, and then as the soul comes into greaterfunctioning activity, the fact of life will be recognised in a new and almostformidable manner. It should be remembered that the soul is a secondary energy,which proves the existence of the primary energy and is responsible for theappearance of the third form of energy—the tangible and the objective. Life willeventually be known as capable of being invoked by the soul in the interests ofthe form. Here lies a clue to our general theme.Up till now the mechanism of approach to the life aspect—the antahkarana and theagent, the spiritual will—has not been understood in any useful sense. Today,the first faint hints as to the use of the antahkarana, and its purpose inrelation to the personality and the Spiritual Triad, are being studied by a fewstudents in the world, and their numbers will steadily increase as bothpersonality and soul establish contact and fusion and more people takeinitiation. The purpose , consequently, for the very existence of the fourthkingdom in nature (as a transmitting agent for the higher spiritual energies tothe three lower kingdoms) will begin to appear, and men, in group formation,will consciously begin this work of “saving”—in the esoteric sense, needless tosay—these other grouped lives. The Macrocosm with its purpose and incentiveswill for the first time begin to reflect itself into the human kingdom in anew-[587] and more potent manner, and this in its turn will become the macrocosmof the three lesser states of conscious lives—the animal, the vegetable and themineral kingdoms.All this is a deep mystery, but has remained so only on account of the lack ofdevelopment of the fourth kingdom. There had been a deviation from the originalintent. Its function and field of service could, however, be realised andexpressed only when this highest aspect, the will aspect, had been brought intoconscious expression in mankind through the building and the utilisation of theantahkarana. Along the rainbow bridge the life aspect can flow, and it is tothis that the Christ referred when He states that He had come so that theremight be present upon the Earth, “life more abundantly.” Always there has beenlife, but when the Christ consciousness is radiantly present (as is the casetoday, though on a small scale) and the numbers of those expressing it are vastindeed, the inference is that the antahkarana is firmly established; the rainbowbridge can then be traversed and crossed, and life in abundance and in a new andimpelling sense, and a fresh impulsing sense can also flow through humanity intothe subhuman kingdoms in nature. This is evidence of divinity, and outstandingtestimony of man’s divine origin, and the hope, the saving hope, of the world.The energy and the forces constitute the sumtotal of all that is . This isanother basic truism or platitude upon which the science of occultism is builtand which the healing art must recognise. There is, in manifestation, nothingelse of any kind whatsoever. Disease itself is a form of active energy,demonstrating in forces which destroy or produce death. Therefore, if our basicpremise is correct, disease is also a form of divine expression, for what weknow to be evil is also the reverse side of that which we call good. Shall webelittle the subject or cause a false impression [588] if we regard evil (atleast as far as disease is concerned) as misplaced or maladjusted good? Will youmisunderstand if I say that disease is energy which is not functioning asdesired or according to plan? Inpouring energies are brought into relation withforces, and good health, strong and adequate forms and vital activity result;the same inpouring energies can, however, be brought into relation with the sameforces and a point of friction be set up, producing a diseased area, pain,suffering and perhaps death. The energies and the forces remain of the sameessentially divine nature, but the relationship established has produced theproblem. If this sentence is studied it will be obvious that a definition suchas that can be used to cover all forms of difficulty, and that the ultimateproducer of the situation (either good or evil) is the relationship aspect. Thisstatement is of major importance in all your thinking.2. Two energies meet in man but other five are present. For each is to be founda central point of contact.The two energies which meet in man are the two aspects of the monad, of the Onein manifestation; the monad manifests essentially as a duality: it expressesitself as will and love, as atma-buddhi and these two energies when brought intorelation with the point of mind, with the third aspect of divinity, produce thesoul and then the tangible manifested world: then there is demonstrated in theplanet will, love, and mind or intelligence: or atma-buddhi-manas.As the soul anchors itself as consciousness and life within the human being,that human being contributes the third something which is latent or karmicallypresent in all substance, manas or mind; this is inherited or held in solutionin substance from a previous solar system. In that system intelligence wasunfolded and was retained within substance [589] in order to form the basis ofthe evolutionary development of this, the second solar system. Forget not thatthe seven planes of our solar system constitute the seven subplanes of thecosmic physical plane and that, therefore, spirit is matter at its highest pointof expression, and matter is spirit at its lowest. Life differentiates itselfinto will and love, into great impulsing energies which underlie the entireevolutionary process and motivate its inevitable consummation.Atma-buddhi, as energies, anchor themselves in the soul vehicle, in the egoiclotus, and their fused activity evokes a response from the substance of themental plane which then makes its own contribution. Its reaction produces whatwe call the higher mind, which is of so subtle a nature and so tenuous anemanation that it must perforce relate itself to the two higher aspects andbecome part of the Spiritual Triad. The vortex of forces established under theimpact of the divine will, expressing divine purpose and unified with Being (asidentity and not as a quality), produces the egoic lotus, the vehicle of that“identified soul” which has been swept into expression by the third result ofthe atmic-buddhic impact on the three worlds; the concrete mind and the humanintellect come into expression. There is, therefore, a curious resemblancebetween the three divine aspects in manifestation and the spiritual man upon themental plane. The correspondence is as follows:The monad . . . . . . .Abstract mind.The soul. . . . . . . . . Egoic lotus.The personality . . . Lower or concrete mind.That vague abstraction, the monad, for aeons of time seems unrelated in any wayto the soul and the personality; these two have been and are occupied with thetask of establishing, in due time and under the evolutionary urge, a closefusion [590] or at-one-ment. The abstract mind remains also for aeons of timesomething inconceivable and outside the modes of expression and of thinking ofthe man who is kama-manasic (or emotion and lower mind) and then finally souland concrete mind (or the illuminator and the transmitter of illumination).These correspondences can be found most enlightening if due consideration isgiven to them.In the human being you have, therefore, two major energies anchored; oneunrealised, to which we give the name of the PRESENCE, the other realised, towhich we give the name of the Angel of the PRESENCE. These are the soul (thesolar angel) and the monad. One embodies the monadic ray and the other the soulray, and both of these energies actively or subtly condition the personality.The other five energies which are present are the ray of the mind or theconditioning force of the mental body; the ray of the emotional nature, and theray of the physical body, plus a fourth ray which is that of the personality.The ray of the physical body esoterically “ascends upward towards juncture,whereas the others all move down,” to quote an ancient writing. The ray of thepersonality is a consequence or result of the vast cycle of incarnations. Youhave therefore:1. The monadic ray.2. The soul ray.3. Ray of the mind.4. Ray of the emotions.5. Ray of the physical body.6. Ray of the personality.7. The planetary ray.The planetary ray is always the third Ray of Active Intelligence because itconditions our Earth and is of great potency, enabling the human being to“transact his business in the [591] world of planetary physical life.”I have made only casual reference to these rays elsewhere and have said littleanent the planetary ray; I have laid the emphasis upon another analysis of theconditioning rays, and in this analysis recognised only five rays for practicalusefulness to the man. These are:1. The soul ray.2. The personality ray.3. The mental ray.4. The astral ray.5. The ray of the physical body.However, with the creation and development of the antahkarana, the ray of themonad must also be brought into line, and then that which is its polar opposite,the planetary “livingness,” the third ray, will have to be recognised. I havehere imparted a point of much importance to you. All these energies play anactive part in the life cycle of every man and cannot be totally ignored by thehealer, even though the information may be relatively useless at this time.3. The conflict of these energies with forces and of forces twixt themselvesproduce the bodily ills of man.You will note here that diseases are produced, according to this law, in twoways:1. By the conflict of energies with forces.2. By the conflict of the forces twixt themselves.It will be apparent on the surface that this dual warfare is to be expected.Under the first category there is the warfare which takes place in thepersonality life when the soul definitely turns its attention to its vehiclesand attempts to take [592] control. The more determined the person is to submithis personality to soul control, the more intense will be the conflict, withconsequent physical conditions of a serious kind as a result. Under thiscategory would come the majority of the diseases of disciples and mystics,largely of a nervous nature and often affecting the heart or the blood stream.They will, in the majority of cases, be confined to the area above thediaphragm, and therefore to those areas conditioned by the head, the throat andthe heart centres. A number of what we might call “borderline” cases come underthis heading also, but these are confined to the transfer of energies (undersoul impact) from the solar plexus centre to the heart, and the “line” involvedis simply the diaphragm.Under this first category also would come those difficulties which are broughtabout, for instance, when the energy of the astral body makes its impact uponthe forces of the etheric vehicle, setting up an emotional turmoil, and thusproducing serious solar plexus difficulty with resultant gastric, intestinal andliver disturbances. These are all the result of the conflict between energy andforces. All I can do at this point is to give indication of the type of problemwhich is related to one or other of these two categories; the subject isunsuitable for the brief handling which I purpose here to give.Under the second category, which concerns the conflict between forces andforces, you have the etheric body involved, and the forces concerned are thoseto be found in the major and the minor centres, involving their relation to eachother and their internal reaction to the impact of energies coming from withoutthe etheric body. These forces and their interplay produce the common ills ofman and control the disturbances in the physical organs and the areas of thephysical body which are found around these centres. [593] These in realityconstitute the major conditioning factors for the mass of human beings for longaeons or until such time as the soul “pays attention” to the appropriation infull control of its mechanism in the three worlds. These secondary difficulties,due to the interplay between the centres, fall into three categories, and theseshould be carefully noted:1. The interplay between:a. The centres above the diaphragm, i.e., the head, the throat and the heart,and very occasionally the ajna centre.b. The centres below the diaphragm and their relation to each other.2. The relation of certain centres to each other, such as takes place under theLaw of Transmutation, or the process of lifting up of the forces from one centreto another:a. From the sacral centre to the throat centre.b. From the solar plexus centre to the heart centre.c. From the centre at the base of the spine to the head centre.3. The impact of the “energy” (note the technical accuracy of my phrasing) ofthe centres above the diaphragm on those below the diaphragm.This is a reverse process to that which takes place when the forces below thediaphragm are raised to the centres above the diaphragm. In this third type ofrelation you have the exercise of the potency of magnetism, and in the other youhave the expression of radiation. These two are closely allied at a certainstage of unfoldment.[594] Under all these relationships there are possibilities of difficulties,resulting in an undesirable effect upon the physical organs found within thearea involved. In the early stages of the relation of the centres above thediaphragm to those below, the man is usually quite unaware of what is going onand is then simply the victim of the stimulation applied by the centre emanatingenergy to the centre which receives its impact; or he is the victim ofdevitalisation (producing consequently many forms of physical ills) as thecentres respond to the stimulation. It is all a question of balance or ofequilibrium, and it is for this that the intelligent man and the aspirant muststrive.We come now to a very ambiguous statement and one that is purposely meant to beso:4. The conflict of the first and second persists for ages until the mountain topis reached—the first great mountain top.This refers vaguely (and again purposely so) to the conflict between theenergies above the diaphragm—which normally come from the soul on its ownplane—and the forces below the diaphragm. This is a major and persistentconflict; it begins when the solar plexus centre becomes dominant and powerful,producing crises as in Atlantean days. As the mass of men are still Atlantean inconsciousness, being swayed mainly by their emotional natures, these crisesarise today. Eventually, and metaphysically speaking, the solar plexus centrebegins to have a radiatory effect in response to the magnetic “call” of theheart centre. When the first initiation is taken the first great interplay isset up between the two and the first coordinated activity is established. “Thatwhich is above is now related to that which is below, but that which is belowloses its identity in that which is above,” as the Old Commentary expresses it.The [595] mother is lost to sight because the Christ-Child assumed the place ofinterest. The soul is taking control and leading the aspirant from mountain topto mountain top. At the first initiation, and increasingly at all initiations,energy is brought into a major conflict with the forces; soul energy sweeps intothe etheric body and all the centres become “fighting areas,” with one centrebeing emphasised more than the others. The nature of the battle is no longerthat “twixt the forces and each other,” but is now between the energies and theforces, and it is this which creates the acuteness of the tests for initiation;it is this which produces so many physical ills among those who have taken orare preparing to take the first and second initiations. And it accounts for thediseases of the saints!A great science of the centres will some day emerge, and this will clarify theentire complex problem; the time, however, is not yet. At present, if thisscience were taught openly, the result would be that the thoughts of men wouldbe turned to the fact of the centres and to the areas which they control, andnot to the energies which pour through them. There would be an unwholesome andundesirable stimulation or devitalisation of the substance of the centres, withconsequent acute disease. The law forever holds good that “energy followsthought,” and that energy can be either radiatory or magnetic, but must not bestatically contained within a centre. The true science of the centres will onlybe permitted free circulation when—and only when—men know the rudiments at leastof thought direction and the control of energy impacts.5. The fight between the forces produces all disease, all ills, and bodily painswhich seek release through death.[596] There is here an interesting distinction which should be noted. Death,when it comes, is the result of two things:1. The fight between the forces, and not between energy and the forces. The areaof conflict is the etheric body and the physical body, and no energies arecoming in from without because the man is too ill.2. The loss of the will-to-live. The patient has given in; the internal fight istoo much for him; he can bring in no outside energy to combat the warringforces, and he has reached the point where he does not want to do so.These two phases of the process of dying are indicative of the destiny of thepatient, and should be immediately noted by the healer who (when he finds thempresent) will then apply his skill in aiding the man to die and will not attemptto effect a cure. The door of entry for the life-giving energies is sealed;nothing can enter to aid the healer in his work, and the conflict between theforces—of a general nature or confined to a bitter fight in a particulararea—produces so much friction that there is no hope anywhere, except in death.In this sentence, it might be pointed out that disease refers to the point offriction or of acute trouble; all ills has reference to the general reaction ofthe man to the area of difficulty and to the general disability produced by thedisease, whilst bodily pain refers to the discomfort of the area where thedisease is located and which is indicative of its nature. All words in theserules are most carefully chosen, and even if inadequate from the translator’spoint of view, are not redundant but express different meanings.6. The two, the five and then the seven, plus that which they produce, possessthe secret.[597] The enumeration is in the nature of a summation of what has beenpreviously given, and its most superficial meaning and the one of the most useto the healer could be simply expressed as follows:The healer must bear in mind the fact of the two major energies which arepresent in every personality; the soul and the personality rays. He must thenbear in mind that to these two he must add three conditioning rays, making thefive above mentioned: the mind ray, the ray of the astral body and the ray ofthe physical body.This enumeration will usually prove adequate for all ordinary or average people.If, however, the patient is a very advanced person, another form of enumerationwill be in order; it will be necessary to add two more energies which will thenbe present in real potency: the ray of the monad and the ray of the planet,which is the third ray. This planetary ray when very active (as is the case withvery advanced persons and those who have attained a high point of generalintegration) has a potent effect; planetary prana comes in powerfully on theplanetary ray, and this can be used to bring about a cure. One reason why thegeneral health of all very advanced people is usually good is that pranic energyfrom the planet has a free flow through the mechanism. It is this energy whichthe Master, working through a relatively perfect body, depends upon to keep itin good health. This is a somewhat new piece of information and one which—whenrecognised—will appear both simple and reasonable. “That which they produce” inthis case, and to the healer, means the outer tangible form; there are othersignificances, but with these we need not here deal.The “secret” referred to is the revelation of the manner in which good healthmay be preserved. It is not the secret [598] of how to cure the physical vehiclewhen “bodily ills” are present. But there is a secret of good health which isknown to all initiates above the third initiation; and this they can simplyemploy, if they so choose. However, they may not so choose always unless theyare working with other parts of the Plan which have nothing to do with humanity.If they are among those who are occupied with the unfolding consciousness in manand who are workers for and in the human kingdom, they may know the secret butmay, at the same time, choose not to profit by it because of the need they feelto be completely identified with mankind; they therefore choose to shareconsciously all human experience and to die along lines which are common to therest of men. The entire question of identification lies behind allmanifestation; it is identification with or of spirit and matter which is thesecret of divine appearance; one of the main causes of disease, as well youknow, is the facility with which men identify themselves with the form aspect(with the many localised forces —localised within the personalityring-pass-not). Man neglects to identify himself with the producer of the form,the true spiritual man, and with the energies which he seeks to direct, andwhich—later in the evolutionary cycle—he is insistent upon directing.There is also a secret meaning here which relates to the seven rays as theyexpress themselves in the human kingdom; the knowledge of this secret enables aMaster to control epidemics and widespread diseases; with this you are not atthis time concerned. Incidentally, the relative freedom from the plagues andepidemics which usually follow in the wake of war has been partly due to the useof this sevenfold knowledge by the Hierarchy, plus the scientific knowledge ofhumanity itself.In this connection also (and I mention it simply from the angle of its interest)there are two hierarchical officials—[599] the Mahachohan and His Representativeupon the seventh ray—Who are today in possession of this secret in its entirety,and They are aided by five other Masters in applying the gained knowledge. Thesefive Masters are working primarily with the deva evolution, and this is, as youknow, connected with form, and in this particular case with the healing devas.These seven Members of the Hierarchy are aided in Their turn by one of theBuddhas of Activity, and also by the representative of the Spirit of the Earth.This again makes the two, the five, and then the seven—a different enumeration,and one which when brought together equals nine, which is the number ofinitiation. This numerical relationship brings man to the point where he is“initiated into the realm of perfection and knows no further aches or pains, andhis mind is thus deflected from that which is below to that which is above.”I have mentioned this phase of mankind’s relation to the subject of health so asto show you how subtle and esoteric are the matters with which we are dealing,and so give to the individual patient a sense of proportion, where his bodilyills or even his death are concerned.7. This is the fifth Law of Healing within the world of form .This fifth law is primarily concerned with the fifth principle of mind or manas;it is this principle which makes a human being what he is; it is this principlewhich makes him a prisoner within the form and upon the planet, and thus makeshim vulnerable and open to attacks upon the form aspect; these constitute partof the agelong action of evil versus good. It is this fifth principle, whencontrolled and used by the Son of Mind, Who is a Son of God, which will enablethe spiritual man to free himself from form of every kind, and therefore fromdisease and death.[600] It will be obvious that the healer, as he trains himself in the healingart, has to grasp clearly and candidly certain exceedingly simple yet esotericfacts:1. That healing is simply and essentially the manipulation of energies.2. That he must carefully differentiate between energies and forces.3. That if he seeks real success, he must learn to place the patient asaccurately as possible upon the correct rung of the ladder of evolution.4. That knowledge of the centres is imperative.5. That he himself must work as a soul through his personality.6. That his relation to the patient (unless the latter is highly evolved) is apersonality one.7. That he must locate the centre controlling the area which involves the pointof friction.8. That, as with all else in the occult sciences, disease and healing are bothof them aspects of the great “relationship” system which governs allmanifestation.If the healer will take these eight points and reflect and brood upon them, hewill lay a sound foundation for all work to be done; their relative simplicityis such that it will be obvious that anyone can be a healer if he so chooses andis willing to conform to the requirements. The current idea that a person is a“born” healer, and therefore unique, in reality indicates only that it is one ofhis main directed interests. Therefore, because of this interest, his attentionhas been turned towards the healing art and consequently towards contact withpatients; owing to the inevitable working of the law which governs thought, hediscovers that energy follows his thought and flows through him to the [601]patient. When he does this with deliberation, a healing will often follow. Anyman or woman—given real interest and prompted by the incentive to serve—whothinks and loves, can be a healer, and it is time that people grasped that fact.The entire process of healing is thought-directed; it concerns the direction ofenergy currents or their abstraction, and this is another way of speaking aboutradiation and magnetism. Every initiate is a healer, and the more advanced theinitiate the less is he occupied with the intricacies of centres and forces,energies and their direction. He heals automatically, as was the case with theinitiate, Peter; of him we read that “the shadow of Peter passing by healedeveryone of them.”The major difference to be seen in the interim (an interim of many, manythousands of years) between the type of healing mentioned above and the work ofa less advanced healer, will be that those healers who are trained physiciansand accredited medical men as well as spiritual healers will have a greatadvantage over the untrained healer, because their diagnosis of the disease willbe more apt to be correct and their powers of visualisation will be greater,owing to their trained familiarity with the structure of the body and theirknowledge of morbid pathology. It will be wise, for a very long time to come,for the spiritual healer to work always in collaboration with a trainedphysician. The healer will provide the required occult knowledge. The time whenany nice, kindly and spiritually minded person sets up as a healer should bewell-nigh over; any healing practice should be preceded by years of carefulstudy anent the nature of energy, of the ray types, of the centres; a minimum ofat least three years should be given to this; when to this is added the scienceof the trained medical man, graduating from our best medical colleges, you willthen have a new and much better treatment of the human vehicle than is now [602]the case. Then the healer’s orthodox and occult knowledge, his visualisingcapacity and his power of thought direction will be real and practicallyeffective.The rule connected with Law V makes clear the need for this occult knowledge,for it states very definitely certain fundamental injunctions.RULE THREELet the healer concentrate the needed energy within the needed centre. Let thecentre correspond to the centre which has need. Let the two synchronise andtogether augment force. Thus shall the waiting form be balanced in its work.Thus shall the two and the one, under right direction, heal.This rule presupposes a knowledge of the centres, and this knowledge is, as youwell know, still embryonic; all that is known in most cases is the location of acentre. This, however, especially with untrained healers, is sufficient. Toodetailed a knowledge of the formation, condition and responsiveness of a centrewould handicap the healer, for his thought would be deflected to the detail ofthe form and away from the energy and its movements.The rule here requires that the healer, having aligned himself with the soul and“tapped” soul energy (thereby making himself a channel for spiritual force),directs this energy into that one of his own centres which corresponds to thecentre conditioning the area of the point of friction. If the disease orphysical trouble is stomachic, for instance, or related to the liver, the healerwill direct his soul energy into the solar plexus centre, situated in theetheric spinal column. If the patient should be suffering from difficulty in theheart or the lungs the healer will use the heart centre, employing the throatcentre for diseases of the bronchial tract, the throat, the mouth or the ears.[603] Two things, therefore, become of importance in connection with the healerhimself:1. He must know as accurately as possible his own point of development, for thatwill indicate to him capacity or non-capacity to work with any or with all thecentres. In order to use any of his centres in the healing work, the healer musthave awakened them in some measure and be able, consciously and by the power ofthought, under the agency of the will, to focus energy in whichever centre hechooses. This does not mean that all the centres are awakened and trulyfunctioning. It should, however, mean (if he is to heal at all) that he is notconfined to the sole use of the centres below the diaphragm but that, by aneffort of the spiritual will, thought can be channelled into the higher centres.Many aspirants can do this with greater facility than they believe.2. The healer, as he channels energy into some centre, prior to directing it toa centre in the patient’s body, must run no risk of his personaloverstimulation. This is a very important point. So much disease and physicaldifficulty among ordinary people is abdominal, necessitating the constant use ofthe solar plexus centre by the healer; this could bring about a grave conditionof overemotionalism and even acute astralism on the part of the healer. He wouldthen be the victim of his good intentions and of his spiritual service, for theconsequences would all the same be bad; energy is an impersonal force and apurely impersonal agency. Purity of intention, selfless service and goodwill areno true protection, in spite of the platitudes of the sentimental occultist. Infact, the presence of these desirable conditions only increases the difficulty,for soul energy will pour in with [604] great force. An understanding of therisks involved, a sane appraisal of possibility and a scientific and technicalunderstanding of protective measures will be given to the healer towards thelatter end of his training. For the present, and because the danger is not atthis time so great (owing to lack of potency in people’s thinking and theirinability to direct thought) the major protective measure consists in theability of the healer to hold his consciousness steady in the head centre withthe “eye of direction” turned to the needed centre. This involves a dual focus,and for the ability to do this the healer must strive.It is here that the healer distinguishes between the processes of radiation andmagnetisation. Having concentrated soul energy in the appropriate centre,through the power of direction from the head (the seat of soul energy) and bythe potency of thought, the process of radiation ends. This radiation has passedthrough two stages:1. The stage wherein the soul radiated energy into the head centre.2. The stage wherein the healer directs a ray of that energy from the headcentre into the “needed centre”; it is there focussed and held steady.From that appropriate centre the stage of synchronisation with the correspondingcentre in the patient’s body is established; this is done, not by the healersending a ray into that centre, but because the potency of the healer’s centreevokes response from that of the patient; it acts like a magnet, drawing forth adefinite radiation from the patient. This radiation, esoterically, “lights up”the point of friction in the surrounding area and—were the healerclairvoyant—would thus enable him to see more clearly the seat of the [605]trouble and, therefore, to arrive at a more accurate diagnosis. Ordinarily, thespiritual healer is depending upon the diagnosis of the medical man inattendance, if he is not one himself.The interplay is now established between the healer and the patient and uponetheric levels. The energy of their two synchronised centres is now en rapport,and the healer has at this point to determine whether the treatment requires anexpulsive technique or a stimulating one. He has therefore to ascertain whetherthe patient’s centre is overstimulated and if some of the surplus energy shouldconsequently be driven out or abstracted, or whether there is a condition ofdevitalisation and the energy of the centre involved requires a deliberateaugmenting.There is, however, a third possibility mentioned here which is slower, but inpractically every case is more desirable; it is the attainment of that balanceof energies (between the healer and the patient) which will hold the energy inthe area of the point of friction and permit nature itself to bring about anunassisted cure. This is possible only when the rapport between the patient andthe healer is complete. Then the sole task of the healer is to hold thesituation steady, give the patient confidence in the powers inherent within him,and encourage a period of patient waiting. The cure then is more lasting, andthere is no sense or period of psychic shock, which can be the case if suddenstimulation or drastic expulsion is employed.We have noted here, as you see, three modes whereby the healer employs the forcefocussed, by direction, in his centres:1. For the expulsion of surplus energy in an overstimulated centre. [606]2. For definite processes of stimulation of the patient’s centres.3. To preserve a state of equilibrium wherein natural healing can take place.In the first case, the healer deliberately increases the potency of the energystored in his centre, so that it becomes exceedingly magnetic and abstracts theoversupply of energy in the patient’s centre; in the second case, the healersends a powerful ray of his own energy into the corresponding centre in thepatient’s body. This is an act of radiation and is very effective; in the thirdcase, an interplay is set up which preserves balance, and furthers steady andnormal activity in the centre controlling the area of trouble.You will note also how all these processes (and they are relatively simple whengrasped) are dependent upon the decision of the healer. It is here that mistakescan be made, and the man who is seeking to work along the lines I indicate wouldbe well-advised to move slowly and with due caution even at the expense of beingineffectual and unsuccessful. It is better to have no effect upon the patientand his condition than by the potency of one’s unwise decision, the power ofone’s thought and the focus of one’s direction, to hasten the patient’s death bythe sudden abstraction of needed energy or by the stimulation of a centrealready overstimulated and overactive.In the last analysis the aim in the three modes of aiding the patient by directwork with the centres involved, is to bring about a balanced and wholesomeactivity. This is more easily achieved in the case of an advanced person than inthe case of the individual in whom the centre is normally inactive andunawakened and where the difficulty is more apt to be due to the action of someof the twenty-one minor centres situated in the body than to that of the sevenmajor [607] centres. In these cases, the patient can far more easily be helpedby orthodox medicine and surgery than by any processes of spiritual healing. Itis for this reason that the spiritual healer is only now becoming important andhis work in any way possible. This is owing to the rapid spiritual developmentof humanity, which enables men, for the first time and on any substantial scale,to take advantage of these laws and rules.In the last sentence in Rule Three, the meaning of the two and the one is thatthe combined energy within the healer—soul energy focussed in the head centreand the energy of the “needed centre,” plus the energy of the centre whichcontrols the point of friction in the patient’s body—is responsible for thehealing, providing it is the destiny of the patient to be healed.LAW VIWhen the building energies of the soul are active in the body, then there ishealth, clean interplay and right activity. When the builders are the lunarlords and those who work under the control of the moon and at the behest of thelower personal self, then you have disease and ill health and death.This is a most interesting law, because it deals basically with causes,primarily with causes over which the average person has no conscious control,and because it occultly gives a picture in miniature or microcosmically of theuniversal or macrocosmic situation. It deals with the entire problem of evil, orpain and suffering (the great mysteries of our little planet) in a fewsentences, but they are sentences conveying vast implications. The verysimplicity of this great natural law veils the far-reaching significances of itsnormal working. It says the following things quite simply, and I enumerate thembecause the breaking down of a paragraph [608] into its clear and simplestatements is a sound way to arrive at understanding:1. When the soul controls the form involved, there is health.2. The soul is the builder of the form, the constructive force in manifestation.3. This is true of both the microcosm and the macrocosm.4. The results are wholeness, right relation and correct activity.5. When the soul is not in control, and the forces of the form nature aretherefore the controlling factors, there will be ill health.6. The builders of the form are the “lunar lords,” the physical, astral andmental elementals.7. These, in their triple totality, compose the personality.8. They are occultly under the direction of the moon, the symbol of form, calledoften the “mother of the form.”9. The emanation coming from the moon has in it the seeds of death and disease,because the moon is a “dead planet.”It all comes back again, as you will note, to the source of the major energycontrolling the body. Though the soul is the source of all life andconsciousness, for aeons all the soul does is to preserve the form in life andin consciousness, until such time that it has reached the stage in evolutionwhere it is a useful and suitable instrument (and will become increasingly so)for the soul to employ as a medium of expression and service. Karma determinesthen the quality and nature of the physical body. It can be healthy because ithas not been misused in the particular life or lives conditioning a particularincarnation, or unhealthy because it is paying the price of error. Good healthis not necessarily dependent upon conscious soul contact. [609] That can anddoes produce good health, but it is also dependent, in the majority of averagecases, upon the life and intentions of the personality—in this life and inprevious lives; it is not until the will of the personality is towards spiritualbetterment and a cleaner, purer life that the soul can be of real assistance.This law carries also the implications of that basic relation which makes thethreefold form of the man an integral part of the macrocosmic whole. All formsin all kingdoms are built by the lunar lords under an impulse emanating from theplanetary Logos, working in cooperation with the Spirit of the Earth—thesumtotal of all the lunar lords and of the three types of energised substancewhich go to the creation of the physical, astral and mental bodies. The relationof the planetary Logos to this Spirit of the Earth (the relation of anevolutionary Being to an involutionary entity) is a reflection (distorted andunder the influence of glamour) in the three worlds of the relation of the soulto the personality elemental. It is most useful for the healer to realise thatin handling disease he is in reality handling involutionary lives and attemptingto work with elementals. The natural trend of these elemental lives, all of themupon the involutionary arc, is to block and to frustrate his efforts and theefforts of the soul, and this—for them—is their way of evolution; it is thatwhich will eventually bring them on to the evolutionary arc.When the time comes that the soul can assume conscious control within and overthe form, and can eventually create a form which is adequate to its spiritualneeds, it will be because the elementals which are the sumtotal of thepersonality elemental have reached a point in their development where they areready to move on to the path of return. The work of the soul is never the purelyselfish one of having a medium of expression in the three worlds, as mightsometimes [610] appear to the casual and superficial thinker. That is entirelyincidental from the angle of the soul; it is a needed activity, but it involvesalso the sacrificial work of salvaging substance and forwarding the evolution ofmatter. As the Old Commentary expresses it: “The Mother (substance-matter) issaved by the birth of her Son (the Christ within, the spiritual consciousness).”This is true of the macrocosm as well as of the microcosm.Here lies the secret of planetary suffering and of death. Our planetary Logos(viewing the truth from the angle of the macrocosm) is, as you know, one of the“imperfect Gods” of The Secret Doctrine , although perfect past our humancomprehension—the comprehension of a unit in one of the kingdoms whichconstitute His body of manifestation. There is still no true balance betweenspirit and matter, though the point of balance has almost been achieved; theinvolutionary forces are still potent and the spiritual energies are stillfrustrated, though far less so than earlier in human history; the next greathuman race, following on our present one, will see a point of balance reachedwhich will usher in the so-called golden age. Points of friction will then befar fewer upon the planet and therefore in individual man; areas of frustrationand of futile activity will die out. This can be seen working out in the body ofan advanced person or an initiate to a great extent and for long periods intheir incarnations; paralleling correspondences are as a general rule accurate.This law gives an amazing picture, and one too which is full of hope,particularly if one considers certain facts which are present in the world todayand compares them with conditions hundreds of years ago. The consciousness ofhumanity is awakened everywhere; the most undeveloped races are in process ofachieving education, involving necessarily the discovery of the mind; goodwillis being recognised [611] as necessary to world unfoldment, and men are findingthat “no man liveth unto himself”—or any nation either; they are registering thefact that it is simply commonsense and the part of wisdom to better conditionsfor all men everywhere. This is a new attitude and a fresh and most hopefulapproach. Men are learning to know and understand each other; nations arearriving at a closer contact with one another; statesmen of all nations arewrestling together and in joint conclave with the problem of bettering humanliving conditions; everywhere there is thought, there is appraisal, and there isthe struggle for freedom and for the truer values. What is all this but theeffort of the soul of humanity to kill out disease, restore unhealthy areas tohealth and eliminate points of friction? Is not this what the spiritual man whois ill is seeking to bring about in his own body, and what the healer isattempting to aid him to do?In so doing, the “lunar lords” and the forces of substance must eventually yieldto the energy of the soul, and are benefited, whether they are microcosmicforces or macrocosmic.One of the things which frequently puzzle students is the statement that thedense physical body is not a principle. H.P.B. states this fact with emphasis;people are apt to think (unless they are theosophical fanatics) that he wasincorrect or was intentionally misleading students. One of the points, littleunderstood, is the nature of a principle. Yet only by understanding what aprinciple is can the beauty and accuracy of his statement be grasped. What, inthe last analysis, is a principle? A principle is that which, macrocosmicallyspeaking, is being developed upon each plane of our seven planes—the sevensubplanes of the cosmic physical plane. It is the germ or the seed on eachsubplane which embodies some aspect of the divine unfolding consciousness; [612]it is that which is fundamentally related to some form of sensitivity; it isthat to which the bodies, as they evolve, find that they can respond. Aprinciple is a germ of awareness, carrying all the potentiality of fullconsciousness on some particular level of divine activity. It is that whichmakes knowledge and conscious response to environment possible; it is that whichconnotes a sequential and “unrolling” sensitive activity, resulting in divineunderstanding, possible and inevitable.The physical body, and to a far less extent the astral and mental bodies, areautomatic in their activity as aspects of a divine response apparatus, of amechanism which enables the Heavenly Man, the planetary Logos and the spiritualman to register conscious response to that which is to be contacted under thedivine plan and through the medium of a mechanism. At present, the physical bodyis the only one which is as yet so fully developed that it has in this planetaryscheme of ours no further evolutionary development, except in so far as thespiritual man can affect it—and most of the effect is produced in the ethericbody and not in the dense physical. This is a point little grasped but of majorimportance.The dense physical body reached its high point of development and of interest(from the angle of mental attention and of hierarchical action) in the previoussolar system. It was then the divine goal of the entire evolutionary process.This is not an easy point for humanity today to grasp. It is not possible oradvisable for me to indicate the evolutionary stages through which this divinemechanism passed in preparation for the task to be undertaken in the presentsolar system. In this divine incarnation of our planetary Logos through themedium of this little planet, the Earth, the physical body is not a goal, butsimply something which exists and must be accepted, and which must be adaptedand [613] incorporated into the general evolutionary plan. That plan has to doentirely with consciousness. The physical body is simply (no more and no less)the vehicle of consciousness upon the physical plane, but the emphasis ofattention is the etheric body as an expression of the subtler vehicles and theirstate of embodied consciousness. The physical body is important because it hasto house and respond to every type of conscious response, from that of thelowest type of human being up to and inclusive of the consciousness of aninitiate of the third degree. The bodies and forms of the indwelling consciouslife in the three subhuman kingdoms have an analogous but less difficultproblem; I am here, however, considering only the physical body of a humanbeing, which is not a principle because it is not in any way a goal; it is notthe seed or germ of anything. Any changes wrought in the physical body aresecondary to the goal of conscious response to the revelation of an emergingdivinity. I have felt it necessary to emphasise this because of the confusion inmen’s minds anent the subject. To sum up: the physical body is not a principle; it is not a main object ofattention of the aspirant; it automatically responds to the slowly unfoldingconsciousness in all the kingdoms of nature: it constantly remains that which isworked upon and not that which has an innate influence of its own; it is notimportant in the active process, for it is a recipient and not that whichinitiates activity. That which is important is the unfolding consciousness, theresponse of the indwelling spiritual man to life, circumstances, events andenvironment. The physical body responds. When the physical body becomes, inerror, the object of attention, retrogression is indicated; and this is why allprofound attention to the physical disciplines, to vegetarianism, to diet and tofasting, and to the present modes of (so-called) mental and divine healing, areundesirable [614] and not in line with the projected plan. Therefore undueconsideration and excessive emphasis upon the physical body is reactionary andis like the worship of the golden calf by the children of Israel; it isreversion to that which at one time was of importance but today should berelegated to a minor position and below the threshold of consciousness.I have dealt with this here because in Law VII the fact of the endocrine glandsis brought to our attention, and it is necessary that we approach this subjectfrom the right point of view. The endocrine glands are a tangible part of thephysical body; they are therefore a part of that created manifestation which isnot regarded as a principle. They are, however, effective and potent and may notbe ignored. It is essential that students regard these glands as effects and notcauses of events and happenings and conditions in the body. The physical body—no matter what its victims may believe and declare—is always conditioned byinner causes; it is never, intrinsically, itself a cause. It is, in this solarsystem and on our planet, automatic and affected by causes generated on theinner planes or by the action of the soul. Please note the importance of thisstatement. The physical body has no true life of its own, but is simply—in thiscycle—responsive to impulses emanating from elsewhere. Its achievement and itstriumph is that it is an automaton. If you can grasp this adequately, we cansafely proceed to the consideration of Law VII and Rule Four.LAW VIIWhen life or energy flows unimpeded and through right direction to itsprecipitation (the related gland), then the form responds and ill healthdisappears.One of the interesting factors which students should note is the doctrine ofintermediaries which is to be found [615] in such rich abundance and isregarded as of such vital importance in all occult teaching. It has beenemphasised (though erroneously interpreted) in the Christian teaching anent theChrist; Christianity has presented Him as acting as the intermediary between anangry God and a pitiful and ignorant humanity. Such was by no means the intentof His coming or of His work, but into the real meaning I need not enter here. Ihave dealt with this theme elsewhere in connection with the New World Religion.(The Problems of Humanity, Chapter VI. & The Reappearance of the Christ, ChapterV. )It has been taught also in the esoteric presentation (and this is closely alliedwith the Christian doctrines) that the soul is the intermediary between themonad and the personality; the same idea is also found in many other religiouspresentations, i.e., the Buddha is shown as the intermediary between Shamballaand the Hierarchy, acting in this capacity once a year; the Hierarchy itself isthe intermediary between Shamballa and Humanity; the etheric plane (and by thisI mean the cosmic, planetary and individual etheric vehicles) is theintermediary between the higher planes and the dense physical body. The wholesystem of occult or esoteric revelation is based on this wonderful doctrine ofinterdependence, of a planned and arranged conscious linking, and of thetransmission of energy from one aspect of divine manifestation to another;everywhere and through everything is circulation, transmission, and modes ofpassing energy from one form to another form, and always through an appropriatemechanism. This is true in the involutionary sense, in the evolutionary sense,and in a spiritual sense also; this latter is slightly different to the othertwo, as all initiates of the higher degrees know well. An entire thesis upontransmitting agencies could be written, and it would include, finally, thedoctrine of Avatars. An Avatar is one [616] who has a peculiar facility orcapacity (besides a self-initiated task and a preordained destiny) to work withenergies, transmitted via the etheric body of a planet or of the solar system;this, however, is a deep mystery. It was demonstrated in a peculiar manner, andin relation to cosmic energy, by the Christ Who, for the first time in planetaryhistory, transmitted the cosmic energy of love directly to the physical plane ofour planet, and also in a peculiar manner to the fourth kingdom in nature, thehuman. This should indicate to you that though the love energy is the secondaspect of divinity, the Christ embodied and transmitted four qualities of thisaspect to humanity, and consequently to the other kingdoms in nature—the onlyfour which humanity could absorb. Only one of these four is as yet beginning toexpress itself —the quality of goodwill. The other three will later be revealed,and one is related in a peculiar sense to the healing quality of love. Accordingto The New Testament, this quality was called by the Christ “virtue” (a somewhatinaccurate translation of the word originally used); Christ employed it whenhealing force had been taken from Him and He said “virtue has gone out of me.”I have called this to your attention because this truth is directly related tothis seventh law. We have seen, in connection with all the healing processes,that the dense physical body is regarded esoterically as simply an automaton; itis only a recipient of transmitted energies. We have seen that the etheric bodyin or “substanding” every form is itself a structure for the transmission ofenergies coming from some source or another—the source being primarily the pointwhere the life within the form lays its basic emphasis. For the average humanbeing, this is usually the astral body, from which astral or emotional energyemanates and finds anchorage, prior to transmission into the [617] etheric body.There will be, however, in the majority of cases, a greater or less admixture ofmental energy. Later, soul energy, reinforced (if I may use such a word) by thepurified mind and transmitted through the personality, will condition theetheric body and control, consequently, the activities of the physical vehicle.This law brings to our attention the fact that the dense physical body, underthe impact of subjective energies, in its turn produces a “structure fortransmission” and automatically repeats the activity of the etheric body. Itcreates (in response to the inflow of energies from the etheric body, via theseven major centres) a dense physical interlocking structure, to which we havegiven the name “the endocrine glandular system.” These glands—in their turn andin response to the inflowing energy from the etheric body—produce a secretionwhich is called a secretion of hormones, and this the glands transmit directlyinto the blood stream.It is not my intention to be overtechnical in my consideration of this subject;I write for the lay reader, and not for the medical profession, who are frank toadmit how little they know, as yet, anent this subject. The medical researchworker knows little anent the relation of the endocrine glands to the blood andto the total physiology of the human being; he knows little anent the relationof the various glands to each other; these constitute an interlockingdirectorate of vital importance, linked and united, animated and directed by theseven etheric centres. This is a factor naturally overlooked by the orthodoxscientist in this field, and until he recognises that which produces theendocrine glands he will remain totally at sea as to cause and true results. Theglands are direct precipitations of the seven types of energy flowing throughthe seven etheric centres. They control all the areas of the body. In theircreation [618] you have a definite expression of the radiatory and the magneticactivity of all energies, for they are produced by radiation from the sevencentres, but their effect—individual and combined—is magnetic. The radiationabstracts dense physical atoms and focusses them in the correct area in thephysical body, so that they can act as distributors into the blood stream, andtherefore into the dense physical body, of one aspect of the inflowing energy. Iwould have you note that only one aspect of the energy is thus distributed—thatwhich corresponds to the third aspect of active intelligent substance; the othertwo latent aspects are distributed as pure energy, affecting areas but notaffecting any localised focal point. A gland is such a localised focal point. Iam anxious for this subject of the glands and their relation to the centres tobe correctly understood. The entire subject is closely related to the art ofhealing; one of the effects of the application of the healing energy (throughthe medium of any centre conditioning the area wherein the point of friction islocated) is the stimulation of the related gland and its increased activity. Theglands are intermediaries, in the last analysis, between the healer and thepatient, between the centre and the dense physical body, and between the ethericbody and its automaton, the receiving dense physical vehicle.In continuing our consideration of the immediate transmitting agency of thecentres into the blood stream (the endocrine glands) I would like to point outthat the centres work through this endocrine system through direct impact,through a ray or stream of energy, emanating from the central point within thecentre. Through this medium they condition and control entire areas of the bodyand they do this through those aspects of the centres which we symbolically callthe “petals of the lotus.” In a point at the very centre of the lotus the lifeforce is focussed, and as [619] it passes outward into the related gland, ittakes on the quality of the energy for which the centre is responsible, becauselife force is essentially unqualified. The ray of life, if one may call it so,which is found at the heart of each centre, is identified monadically with itssource, and possesses (when brought in contact with its petals) one major innatequality of attractive energy; all energy emanating from the one source in thissolar system, is related to the energy which we call Love, and this energy ismagnetic attraction. The petals of the lotus, and the area of surrounding energywhich constitutes the form of the lotus, are qualified by one of the sevensubsidiary types of energy; these emanate from the seven Rays which emerge outof the one Source, as Representatives of the manifold Creator.Within the solar system, as you know, are to be found the seven sacred planets,which are the custodians or the expression of these seven rays, of these sevenqualities of divinity within our planet, the Earth (which is not a sacredplanet), there are likewise seven centres which become, as evolution proceeds,the recipients of the seven ray qualities from the seven sacred planets, thusproviding(within the solar ring-pass-not) a vast interlocking system of energies. Threeof these centres, representing the three major rays, are well known to you:1. Shamballa The ray of power or purpose. The first aspect. The energy of will.2. The Hierarchy The ray of love-wisdom. The second aspect. The energy of love.3. Humanity The ray of active intelligence. The third aspect. The energy of mindor thought.[620] There are four other centres, and these, with the above three, constitutethe seven centres, or the seven planetary focal points of energy, whichcondition the bodily manifestation of our planetary Logos. Through them the Lordof the World, working from His Own level on a cosmic plane and through Hisdivine Personality, Sanat Kumara, carries out His purposes upon our planet.Similarly, within the microcosm, man, the correspondences to these seven centresare to be found. Therein likewise are seven major centres, and they are therecipients of the energy emanating from the seven planetary centres, thecustodians of the seven aspects of ray force; these seven energies—at variousstages of potency—condition the man’s expression in the three worlds, make himwhat he is at any given moment whilst in incarnation, and indicate (by theireffect or lack of effect upon the centres) his point in evolution.Two of these centres in the human being are to be found in the head, and theother five are to be found up the spinal column. This spinal column is thephysical symbol of that essential alignment which is the immediate goal ofdirected relationships, carried forward in consciousness by the spiritual manand brought about as a result of right meditation.Meditation is a technique of the mind which eventually produces correct,unimpeded relationship; this is another name for alignment. It is therefore theestablishment of a direct channel, not only between the one source, the monad,and its expression, the purified and controlled personality, but also betweenthe seven centres in the human etheric vehicle. This is—perhaps astonishingly toyou—putting the results of meditation on the basis of physical, or rather ofetheric, effects, and may be regarded by you as indicating the very lowest phaseof such results. This is due to the [621] fact that you lay the emphasis uponyour mental reaction to the produced alignment, on the satisfaction you acquirefrom such an alignment, in which you register a new world or worlds ofphenomena, and on the new concepts and ideas which consequently impinge uponyour mind. But the true results (as divine and as esoterically desirable) arecorrect alignment, right relationship, and clear channels for the seven energiesin the microcosmic system, thereby bringing about eventually a full expressionof divinity. All the seven centres in the etheric vehicle of the Christ wererightly adjusted, correctly aligned, truly awakened and functioning, andproperly receptive of all the seven streams of energy coming from the sevenplanetary centres; these put Him en rapport, therefore, and in full realisedcontact, with the One in Whom He lived and moved and had His being. Thephysiological result of this complete “esoteric surrender of the seven” (as itis sometimes called) to the incoming spiritual energies, in their right orderand rhythm, was the appearance in the Christ of a perfect endocrine system. AllHis glands (both major and minor) were functioning correctly; this produced a“perfect man”—physically perfect, emotionally stable and mentally controlled. Inmodern terms, the “pattern of the behaviour” of the Christ—due to the perfectionof His glandular system, as an effect of correctly awakened and energisedcentres—made Him an expression of divine perfection to the entire world; He wasthe first of our humanity to arrive at this point in evolution, and “the Eldestin a great family of brothers,” as St. Paul expresses it. The current picturesof the Christ testify to their own complete inaccuracy, for they bear no witnessto any glandular perfection; they are full of weakness and sweetness, but showlittle strength, alert power and aliveness. And the promise has gone forth thatas He is, so may we be in this world.[622] This is a promise which lies behind the right understanding of the scienceof the centres; the factual reality of the centres will be proven to all menwhen the centres are gradually brought under control of the soul, are correctlyand scientifically energised and brought to a condition of true “livingness,”and begin to condition the entire area of the body in which a centre is found,and—between them—bringing every part of the human body under their radiatory andmagnetic influence.It is the centres which hold the body together and make it a coherent, energisedand active whole. As you know, when death takes place, the consciousness threadwithdraws from the head centre and the life thread withdraws from the heartcentre. What has not been emphasised is that this dual withdrawal has an effectupon every centre in the body. The consciousness thread, anchored in the headcentre, qualifies the petals of the lotus called in the oriental literature the“thousand-petalled lotus,” and the petals of that lotus have a relationship anda definitely qualifying effect (both radiatory and magnetic) upon the petals inevery one of the other major centres within the etheric body; the head centrepreserves them in qualifying activity, and when this quality of consciousresponse is withdrawn from the head centre an immediate effect is felt in allthe petals of all the centres; the qualifying energy is withdrawn, leaving thebody via the head centre. The same general technique is true of the life threadwhich is anchored in the heart, after passing (in alliance with theconsciousness thread) into and through the head centre. As long as the lifethread is anchored in the heart it energises and preserves in livingness all thecentres in the body, sending out its threads of life into a point which is foundat the exact centre of the lotus, or at the heart of the centre. This issometimes called “the jewel in the lotus,” though the phrase [623] is morefrequently applied to the monadic point at the heart of the egoic lotus on itsown plane. When death takes place and the life thread is gathered up by the souland withdrawn from the heart into the head and from thence back into the soulbody, it carries with it the life of each centre in the body; therefore, thebody dies and disintegrates, and no longer forms a coherent, conscious, livingwhole.Related to these centres, and reacting in strict unison with them, is theendocrine or glandular system, through which system—during incarnation—life orenergy flows unimpeded and under right direction in the case of the highlydeveloped man, or impeded and imperfectly directed in the case of the average orundeveloped human being; through this system of glandular control, the humanform responds or does not respond to the surrounding world energies. Inconnection with our present theme of healing, a man can be sick and ill or welland strong, according to the state of the centres and their precipitation, theglands. It must ever be remembered that the centres are the major agency uponthe physical plane through which the soul works, expresses life and quality,according to the point reached under the evolutionary process, and that theglandular system is simply an effect—inevitable and unavoidable—of the centresthrough which the soul is working. The glands therefore express fully the pointin evolution of the man, and according to that point are responsible for defectsand limitations or for assets and achieved perfections. The man’s conduct andbehaviour upon the physical plane is conditioned, controlled and determined bythe nature of his glands, and these are conditioned, controlled and determinedby the nature, the quality and the livingness of the centres; these, in theirturn are conditioned, controlled and determined by the soul, in increasingeffectiveness as evolution proceeds. Prior to soul control, they areconditioned, qualified [624] and controlled by the astral body, and later by themind. The goal of the evolutionary cycle is to bring about this control, thisconditioning, and this determining process by the soul; human beings are todayat every imaginable stage of development within this process.I realise that much of the above is well known and in the nature of repetition.But I have felt it essential to repeat the story so that there may be a freshclarity in your thinking.It will be apparent to you also that the karmic process in any individual lifemust therefore work out through the medium of the glands, which condition thereaction of the person to circumstance and events. The results of all previouslives and of all activities carried on during those lives have been registeredby the Lords of Karma; karmic law works in close cooperation with the lunarLords, who build and construct the bodies which constitute the personality;later, the law works in an even closer cooperation with the soul purpose. Thewhole problem is necessarily most intricate and difficult. All I can do is togive certain indications.It is with this system of centres and their externalised effects, the glands,that the healer has to work and which he has to take into most carefulconsideration; all stimulation which he may be able, for instance, to convey toa centre in the patient’s body, or all abstraction of energy from a centre, willhave a most definite effect upon the allied or related gland, and therefore uponthe secretion which that gland is in the habit of pouring into the blood stream.As again you know, the seven major centres and their allied glands are asfollows:1. The head centre The pineal gland. 2. The ajna centre The pituitary gland. 3.The throat centre The thyroid gland. 4. The heart centre The thymus gland. 5.The solar plexus centre The pancreas. 6. The sacral centre The gonads. 7. Thecentre at base of spine The adrenal glands.[625] There are also other centres and many other glands in the body, but theseare the seven with which the healer works; the minor or subsidiary glands areconditioned by the centre controlling the area in which they are located. Thehealer, however, refuses to complicate his thinking with the multiplicity anddetail of the other lesser glandular system and with the intricacies of lesserinterior relationships. The above list gives also the centres and glands whichbasically determine the state of health—good, indifferent or bad—and thepsychological equipment of a man. Students should bear in mind that the primaryeffect of the activity of the glands and of their secretions is psychological. Aman is, upon the physical plane, emotionally and mentally what his glandularsystem makes him, and incidentally what they makes him physically, because thatis frequently determined by his psychological state of mind and emotions. Theemphasis of the self-centred ordinary man is largely upon the physical vehicle,and he pays little or no attention to the balance or the imbalance of hisendocrine system or setup (if I may use that word) from the angle of itsdetermining his psychological effect upon his fellow men. It is not my intentionto analyse the various glands, noting how they respond to the awakened or theunawakened condition of the centres, or how they limit or implement theresponsiveness of the man to his environment or determine his interpretation oflife and the passivity or the activity of his daily reactions to events andcircumstance. A man, it may emphatically be stated, is what his glands make him,but they, in their turn, are only the effects of certain inner potent [626]sources of energy. Again, as you see, I repeat this vital truth.It is for this reason that medical science will eventually find the truth (andalready they are sensing it) that it is impossible to fundamentally change thepersonality and the physical equipment of a man through treating the glandsthemselves; little real progress has been made along this line during the thirtyor forty years during which the endocrinologists have considered andinvestigated this subject. Certain things have been found out; certain resultsof the activity or the inactivity of the glands have been noted; certain typesof people have been recognised as illustrative of glandular activity orpassivity; ameliorative measures have been applied and the action of a gland hasbeen stimulated or retarded (with good or bad effects) through various methodsand types of medication. Beyond this little is known, and the best minds in thisparticular field are conscious of the fact that they are face to face with aterra incognita. This situation will remain as it is until modern medicalscience recognises that the world of causes (as far as the endocrine glands areconcerned) is the etheric body with its seven centres; they will then registerthe fact that all work in relation to the glands must be shifted away from theseven effects or precipitations of the centres on to the centres themselves.The healer, therefore, ignores the gland involved and deals directly with thecentre which conditions the “point of friction” and controls the area under itsinfluence; this necessarily includes the gland which the centre has created,formed or precipitated and energised.The concept in the mind of the healer should be, as this law indicates, that anunimpeded channel or a clear passage must be formed along which health-givinglife may flow from the “needed centre” in the healer’s etheric body [627] to theallied centre in the body of the patient and from thence into the blood stream,via the related gland. Forget not, the truth remains eternally right that the“blood is the life”—even if as yet inexplicable in its implications from theangle of the esotericist as well as from the angle of medical science.Healers have to learn to work with the life principle, and not with some vagueenergy which is set in motion by the power of thought or by the potency of love,as is the case presented today by the various healing systems of the world whichmankind has evolved. This life principle is contacted and set in motion by themode of clearing certain etheric channels within the etheric structure whichunderlies every part of the patient’s body. This clearance is not brought aboutby thinking health or by affirming divinity or by eliminating “error” in themental approach, but by the much more prosaic method of directing streams ofenergy via certain centres, and thus affecting certain glands in the area of thephysical body which is diseased and the seat of trouble, pain and distress.That thought or correct thinking is involved is necessarily true; the healer hasto think clearly before he can bring about the desired results, but the energypoured into the patient’s vehicle is not mental energy, but one of the sevenforms of pranic or life energy. This travels along the line of force or thechannel which relates and links all the centres and connects those centres withthe glands. Forget not that this constitutes an interlinking and interlockingdirectorate of the following systems, and that—from the point of view of theesotericist—these systems are symbols of great cosmic processes:1. The etheric body, as a whole, with its channels and communicating lines ofenergy which underlie every part [628] of the human body.2. The seven related centres, each specifically qualified and each in touch, viathe etheric fibres or threads of force, with each and every centre.3. The nadis, that system of slightly denser etheric channels or tiny threads offorce which underlie the entire nervous system; they underlie every type ofnerve and every type of nerve plexus.4. The nervous system itself, which is found extending its radius of influencethroughout the entire body of a man.5. The endocrine or glandular system.6. The blood stream, the recipient of streams of living energy from theendocrine system, via what are called the hormones.7. The interrelated sumtotal, which is the divine manifestation of the spiritualman in any incarnation and at any point in evolution.Therefore, two great streams of energy permeate and animate this entireaggregation of systems: the life stream and the consciousness stream. One worksthrough the nervous system (the consciousness stream) and the other through theblood stream. Both are in fact so closely related and allied that, in action, itis not easy for the ordinary man to differentiate between them.The healer, however, does not work with the consciousness aspect; he worksentirely with the life aspect; the perfect healer (something at presentnonexistent) works through the closed and sealed point within the centre (thevery heart of the centre). There the point of life is to be found. From thispoint within the centre, life rays out into the petals of the lotus, and thecombination of the life at the centre and the consciousness, inherent in thepetals, is the source of the living, breathing, sensitive human [629] being—fromthe physical angle—and this the healer must recognise.Behind this livingness and this consciousness is the Being, the spiritual man,the actor, the one who feels (in varying degrees), and the thinker. Thesimplicity of the above statement is somewhat misleading, as there are otherfactors and relationships and other energies which must be considered, but it isnevertheless basically true, and upon this truth the healer can act.It is interesting to point out that the Great Invocation now being distributedin the world is based upon this same fundamental concept of great systems,conditioning humanity as a whole, which can be energised by the inflow ofstreams of energy, bringing new life and health to the entire body of humanityvia the planetary centres of divine livingness and consciousness.Rule Four which accompanies Law VII is of major importance. This is because ofits extreme simplicity, and because, if comprehended and followed, it forms abridging rule between the subjective and the objective methods of handlingdisease. The law which we have just considered was also exceedingly simple anddirect, and in its implications related to the subjective nature and theobjective form. Students should not be deceived by simplicity and by plain,direct statements. There is a tendency to regard esoteric teaching asnecessarily abstruse and indirect, requiring always the use of the “esotericsense” (whatever is meant by that) in order to arrive at understanding. Yet themore advanced the teaching, very frequently the more simply is it expressed.Abstruseness is related to the ignorance of the student—not to the mode ofpresentation of the teacher. This rule runs as follows: [630]RULE FOURA careful diagnosis of disease, based on the ascertained outer symptoms, will besimplified to this extent—that once the organ involved is known and thusisolated, the centre in the etheric body which is in closest relation to it willbe subjected to methods of occult healing, though the ordinary ameliorative,medical or surgical methods will not be withheld.This rule requires little elucidation, for it is composed of clear, conciseinstructions. Let us list these instructions:1. There must be careful diagnosis, based on the ascertained outer symptoms.2. The organ which is the seat of the trouble must be located. Both theseactivities concern the dense physical body.3. The centre in the etheric body closest to the area of the trouble will nextreceive attention.4. Methods of occult healing are then employed, directed to the stimulation, orthe reverse, of the centre involved.5. Simultaneously, all outer orthodox methods are employed.It is on this question of careful diagnosis that most modern so-called healersgo astray. They do not know enough about the physical body, about the pathologyof disease, about the primary or secondary symptoms, to determine the nature ofthe difficulty; this is because the usual healer has not had medical training,and at the same time he is not psychically equipped to arrive at a truediagnosis in an occult manner. He therefore falls back on the general assumptionthat the patient is sick, that the seat of the trouble appears to be in such orsuch an area of the physical body, that the patient complains of certain painsand aches, and that if the patient can be rendered acquiescent enough, [631] ifhe can grasp (along with the healer) the fact of his divinity—and who can, mybrother?—then if he has faith in the healer, he can assuredly be healed.The outstanding thing usually to note is the ignorance of both the patient andthe healer; the thing to be deplored is the assumption of the healer that, if ahealing does follow, it is due entirely to the healing methods followed, whereasthe patient would, in all probability, have recovered in any case. The healingmay have been hastened by the factor of faith, and faith is simply the focussingof the patient’s energy in line with the injunction of the healer, and aconsequent “display” of that energy in the diseased area in obedience to the lawthat “energy follows thought.” The “explosion” (if I may use so forcible a word)of the energy of faith on the part of the two people involved—the healer and thepatient—occultly and occasionally produces sufficient energy stimulation tobring about a cure where a cure in any case was inevitable. It has simply been ahastening process. This is not, however, a true occult healing and no trueoccult healing methods were employed or involved. Psychologically, the samething can be seen taking place in the case of a “conversion,” as theFundamentalist School of Christianity calls it. The faith of the person and thefaith of the evangelist, plus the faith of the audience (where there is one)bring about a psychological healing along the line of resolving cleavages, orproduce an at-one-ment, even if only of a temporary nature.It must be increasingly borne in mind that there is nothing in the created worldbut energy in motion, and that every thought directs some aspects of thatenergy, though always within the sphere of influence of some greater thinking,directing energy. The healer’s faith and the patient’s faith are both examplesof energy in motion, and at present usually the only energies employed in everycase [632] of healing. Orthodox medicine also works with the same energies,supplementing its orthodox methods with the patient’s faith in the physician andin his scientific knowledge.I am not here going to enlarge further on the injunction to use medical andsurgical methods whenever possible. I have touched upon this subject severaltimes in the course of this teaching upon healing. It is essential that peopleshould realise that the ascertained knowledges of medicine and surgery are justas much an expression of divine experience and understanding as the hopeful,assertive, yet fumbling methods of so-called divine healing—if not more so atpresent. Though much of the orthodox methods remain experimental, they are lessso than the methods of the modern healers, and much of their scientificknowledge is proven and real. It should be used, and confidence can be expressedin it. The perfect healing combination is that of the medical man and thespiritual healer, each working in his own field, and both having faith in eachother; this is not now the case. There is no need to call in divine aid to setbones which the surgeon is well equipped to do, or to clear up infection whichthe physician knows well how to handle. The healer can help and can hasten thehealing process, but the orthodox physician can also hasten the work of thehealer. Both groups need each other.I realise that what I have said here will please neither the spiritual healernor the orthodox medical man. It is time, however, that they learn to appreciateeach other and to work in cooperation. In the last analysis, the spiritualhealer and the new modes of mental healing have relatively little to contributein comparison with the work and the knowledge of the member of the orthodoxprofession. The debt of the world to its doctors and surgeons is very great. Thedebt to healers is decidedly not so great; they oft also poison the channel bybitterness and constant [633] criticism of the physician and of orthodoxmedicine. Surety of knowledge and experience prevents a similar attitude in theorthodox group, plus the realisation that even the spiritual healer will call inthe doctor in times of emergency.The law and the rule now to be considered will carry us into realms of realabstraction; it will not be easy for you to understand much of what I may say.This Law VIII takes us back to the very source of all phenomena as far as thehuman being is concerned—the will of the immortal soul to incarnate on earth orto withdraw from incarnation. It involves also the consideration of the factorof the Will in producing disease as the direct means of bringing about thatwithdrawal. So little is as yet understood anent the Will that it isparticularly hard to explain.LAW VIIIDisease and death are the result of two active forces. One is the will of thesoul, which says to its instrument: “I draw the essence back.” The other is themagnetic power of the planetary life, which says to the life within the atomicstructure: “The hour of reabsorption has arrived. Return to me.” Thus, undercyclic law, do all forms act.Two aspects in the nature of the divine Will are called into play where diseaseand death are concerned: one is the will of the soul to being an incarnation toan end; another is the will of the spirit of the earth (the basic elementalforce) to draw back into itself the released and temporarily isolated substanceof which the soul had availed itself during the cycle of incarnation.The factor of time, the factor of the interplay between the point of will whichis that of the soul, and the diffused ever present will of the elemental spiritof substance are involved, plus their cyclic relation. These we shall attempt toconsider.[634] What I have here to say is of major importance and will throw a new andstrange light upon the entire subject of disease. I will deal, first of all,with the second half of the law, which refers to the “magnetic power of theplanetary life,” which says to the life within the atomic structure: “The hourof reabsorption has arrived. Return to me.”To understand the reference, I would remind you that a human being is aspiritual entity, occupying or informing (which is the occult word I prefer) adense physical vehicle. This dense physical body is part of the generalstructure of the entire planet, composed of living atoms which are under thecontrol of, and are part of the life of the planetary entity. This densephysical vehicle is released into a temporary and directed freedom by the willof the informing soul, but remains at the same time an intrinsic part of thesumtotal of all atomic substance. This physical vehicle—having its own life andhaving a measure of intelligence which we call its instinctual nature—is calledby esotericists the physical elemental. During incarnated life, it is thecoherent force or agency by means of which the physical body preserves itsparticular form, under the impact of etheric livingness; this affects all theliving atoms and brings them into relation with each other. The physical body isthe great symbol (within the one Life) of the many of which it is constituted;it is the demonstrated fact of innate coherency, of unity, of synthesis and ofrelationship. Physical or planetary prana (the lowest form of pranic energy) isthe life of the sumtotal of the atoms (of which all outer forms are composed) asthey are brought into relation to the separated atomic structure of the densephysical body of an individual informing soul in any kingdom ofnature—particularly, from our point of study, the human kingdom. What is true in this connection of the individual or of [635] man, themicrocosm, is true also of the planet, which—like man—is a coherent whole. Thiswholeness is due to the relation of two aspects of life: the life of theplanetary Logos and the life of the spirit of the earth, which is the life ofthe sumtotal of all the atoms which compose all forms. To this sumtotal ofliving substance, of elemental life, man’s dense physical body conforms and istherefore the symbol. These two lives, functioning microcosmically and alsomacrocosmically, create that living pranic energy which circulates throughoutthe etheric bodies of all forms, which produces coherency or a syntheticholding-together and which can be discerned when the densest aspect of theetheric body is seen, creating thus the health aura in plants, trees, sea life,animals and man. Other energies and potencies circulate through and conditionthe etheric vehicle, but I refer here only to the lowest physical aspect. Thisis indicative of the life of the elemental of our planet, the spirit of theearth—a divine life, making its own progress upon the involutionary are ofmanifestation.This spirit of the earth preserves its hold upon the atomic structures of whichall forms are made, including the physical body of man; it gathers them togetheragain eventually and reabsorbs those elements of its life which were temporarilyisolated from it during any incarnated experience of any soul in any of thekingdoms in nature. These atoms, it must be noted, are imbued or conditioned bytwo factors for which the spirit of the earth is solely responsible:1. The factor of the Karma of the life of the elemental of the planet. This isan involutionary, precipitating karma, entirely different to that of theplanetary Logos, Who is a spiritual Life upon the evolutionary arc. Thisinvolutionary karma, therefore, conditions the life experience [636] from thepurely physical angle of all forms composed of atomic substance.2. The factor of limitation. Apart from the karma, resulting in physical events,affecting all physical forms composed of this elemental essence, the physicalvehicles of all lives in all the kingdoms of nature are also conditioned by thepoint in time of the cyclic influence of the planetary spirit and by its pointin evolution. This involutionary spirit has not yet attained a point ofperfection, but is progressing towards a specific goal which will be attainedwhen the evolutionary arc of experience is reached. This lies very far ahead.Our planetary Logos, that great divine Life in Whom we live and move and haveour being, is one of the “imperfect Gods” as yet, from the point of view of thegoal set before all planetary Logoi. His body of expression, our planet, theEarth, is not yet a sacred planet. The spirit of the earth is yet very far fromeven the relative perfection of which a conscious human being is aware.The point in evolution of the spirit of the earth affects every atom in hisbody—the body of an involutionary entity. The result of this imperfection, whichis not that of the planetary Logos but that of the spirit of the earth, showsitself in the presence of disease in all forms in all the kingdoms of nature.Minerals are subject to disease and decay; even the “fatigue” of metals is aregistered scientific fact; plants and animals all react to disease within thestructure of their forms, and disease and death are inherent in the atom ofwhich all organisms are composed. Man is not exempt. Disease, therefore, is notbrought about by wrong thinking, as oft I have told you, or by any failure toaffirm divinity. It is inherent in the form nature itself, being indicative ofthe imperfections from which the spirit of the earth suffers; [637] it is themode par excellence whereby this elemental life retains integrity and thecapacity to reabsorb that which is his but which has been brought under otherdirection by the attractive potency of the life of that which informs everyother kingdom in nature during a cycle of incarnation. This will give you surelya new idea anent disease. Man creates, under soul impulsion and the will toincarnate, a form which is composed of substance already subjected toconditioning; it is already impregnated with the life impulses of the spirit ofthe earth. Man, in so doing, assumes responsibility for that elemental formbut—at the same time—limits himself definitely by the nature of the atoms ofwhich that form is composed. The atomic substance through which the spirit ofthe earth expresses itself has in it ever the “seeds of return,” permitting areabsorption. This substance is also composed of all grades and qualities ofmatter, from the very coarsest up to the very finest, as for instance thequality of the substance which makes the appearance of the Buddha or of theChrist possible. The Lord of the Earth, the planetary Logos, cannot findsubstance animated by the spirit of the earth of a quality and nature pureenough; He cannot, therefore, materialise or make an appearance, as can theBuddha or the Christ. Few of Those who form the Council Chamber at Shamballa canfind the needed or adequate substance by means of which to appear; They cannottake a dense physical body, and have to be content with an etheric vehicle.There are therefore three types of life, affecting the dense appearance of ahuman being during his restricted manifestation or incarnation:1. The life of the spiritual man himself, transmitted from the Monad, via thesoul for the greater part of manifested existence. [638]2. The life of that sumtotal which is the elemental life of the fourth kingdomin nature, the human; this life is still an aspect (under the Law of Isolationor Limitation) of the life of the spirit of the earth.3. The sumtotal of the life which is innate in atomic substance itself—thesubstance out of which all forms are made. This is the life of the spirit of theearth.We are not here referring to the soul in an atom or the soul of any form, greator small; we are referring exclusively to the life or first aspect. Thisexpresses itself as the will-to-be; it is only active, though ever present,during form life or the phase of created manifestation. It is here that the Willfactor makes its appearance and the relation between will, form and incarnationis to be found.One of the factors governing incarnation is the presence of what is called thewill-to-live; when that is to be found, and when it is powerful in man, he isstrongly anchored upon the physical plane: when that is not strongly present oris withdrawn, the man dies. Life in the physical body is preserved, technicallyand occultly, under the impulse of the powerful will-to-be of the incarnatedspiritual man upon the magnetic power of the planetary life, inherent in everyatom of the form nature; by means of these atoms—isolated and held by the Law ofAttraction in form—he has come into being upon the physical plane. This magneticpower is the expression of the will (if such a word can be applied to the senseof coherency which distinguishes the spirit of the earth) of the planetaryentity. It is a projection of his peculiar state of consciousness into anisolated form, created, occupied and indwelt by a soul, by a living man.[639] I have several times used the expression “isolated form,” for it is thispeculiar aspect of isolation which conditions the physical body of a man (or ofany living form, for that matter), rendering it detached, coherent andtemporarily living its own life in response to the imposition of the livingnessof the incarnating soul. Temporarily, the united power of the segregated andisolated atoms—particularly the planetary structure of the spirit of theearth—is in abeyance as regards individual reaction to the planetary life. Onlythe coherent, magnetic qualities persist in any form of activity and inconjunction with the will-to-live of the spiritual man or of any ensoulingentity. This creates a coherent form, held together by two aspects oflivingness: that of the spirit of the earth and that of the spiritual man.Therefore—to use words in an effort to arrive at understanding—two aspects oflife and two forms of will or purpose are brought together. The higher isevolutionary; the lower is involutionary in nature. It is this which creates theconflict. One type of energy is evolutionary and the other is involutionary. Itis these conflicting forces which present the problem of dualism—a dualism ofthe higher and the lower at many differing and varying stages. The final phaseof the conflict is fought out, or rather wrought out, when the Dweller on theThreshold and the Angel of the Presence face each other. It is in thatconsummating event that the pull or conflict between the involutionary life andthe evolutionary life, between the inchoate, magnetic will of the elementalforces (inherent in the atoms of which all three bodies of the personality aremade) and the will of the spiritual man, on the verge of liberation from themagnetic control of substance, is brought to the issue. The spirit of the earthhas its correspondence in the created expression of the spiritual man; it is tobe found in the existence of the personality elemental; this personality [640]elemental can be and frequently is an inchoate force, swayed entirely by desire,and no true personality integration is present; it can, however, be a highlyorganised and potent factor, producing what is called a high grade personalityand an effective instrument for the spiritual man in the three worlds of hisevolution. This is followed later by the conflicts upon the Path of Discipleshipand the Path of Initiation. Then the livingness of the spiritual man, and hiswill to manifest divinely, dominate to such an extent that the death of thepersonality is brought about; this culminates at the time of the thirdinitiation. At that experience the monadic will comes in with such dynamicpotency that the will of the elemental lives of the threefold personality iscompletely negated.But (to return to our theme) the atomic substance, impregnated with the life ofthe spirit of the earth and with the driving force of its inchoate will,demonstrates as magnetic power and is constantly in conflict, within the body ofmanifestation of the informing soul, with the life of the soul. This conflict orfriction is the main cause of what you call disease.Disease is inharmony; it is the fault of fire by friction; diseased areas areareas of friction wherein the atomic substance is temporarily asserting its owntype of livingness and responding (sometimes to the point of death) to themagnetic pull of the will of the spirit of the earth. If that pull provesadequately strong, the friction within the atomic structure, localised in thearea of some etheric centre, will be of such a nature that the quality of thedisease increases, the life of the spiritual man is slowly or rapidly withdrawn;the desire for existence, the spiritual will-to-he is not then as strong as thewill to be reabsorbed—the will of the atoms constituting the physical body; theman, therefore, dies, in the usual sense of the term.[641] The planetary life says, “The hour of reabsorption has arrived. Return tome.” The urge to return is at present the dominant note in the substance of thebodies of humanity; it is responsible for the universal ill health whichdistinguishes the mass of human beings; this tendency has been dominant forcenturies; the attitude is, however, slowly changing, and the time willeventually come when the atoms of the bodies, or the elemental forces, will besent back along the path of reabsorption only at the will of the spiritual manand in response to his express command, and not in response to the magneticpower of the spirit of the earth.We have seen—as we considered the Laws and Rules to date—that fundamentally,disease and death are due to the withdrawal of solar life (the energy of thesoul, sometimes called solar fire) either from some particular area of thephysical body or from the entire body. This fact should remind students of theneed to distinguish between the force or life of the “lunar lords,” inherent inevery atom of which all organs and forms are made, and the energy of the soulwhich permeates the entire body as an integrating factor. Speaking symbolically,therefore, there are times in which the life of these lunar lords are sodominant that the life of the soul is overpowered in some particular area, andthe consequent withdrawal of the solar life produces disease; or—putting itanother way—the friction which ensues when the lunar lords are not compliantproduces disease. Yet death is not indicative of a full victory of the lunarlords, but rather that under the plan of the soul, and because the life cycle iscomplete, the energy of the soul is entirely withdrawn, leaving the lunar lordsalone. At times (because it is also in the planning of the soul) the lunar lordstemporarily are the victors, though death does not follow; convalescence issignificant of the gradual re-entry of soul energy and its subsequent control[642] of the lunar lords. This aspect of soul energy is not that of thoseenergies which represent and lead to the expression of soul quality. It is lifeenergy, coming from the Monad which passes through the soul as a channel andmedium of contact; its direct channel is, needless to say, the sutratma. It isnot the antahkarana, or the creative thread or the thread of consciousness.These are frequently rendered inactive when acute disease is present, and thelife aspect is weakening or rapidly or slowly withdrawing itself.You can see, therefore, why it is that those who have succeeded in building theantahkarana, the rainbow bridge between the Monad and the personality, haveestablished a contact (nonexistent in the average man) between the Monad, theSource of Life, and the personality—the expression of that Life in objectivity.The Monad then, and not the soul, controls the cycles of outward expression, andthe initiate then dies at will and according to plan or the necessities of thework. This, of course, refers only to initiates of high degree. I felt thesepoints to be interesting and also useful for you to know. Another point, growingout of all the above, indicates the all-inclusiveness of the divine Life, forthe lunar lords are aspects of that Life as much as is the energy of the soul.It is therefore of prime importance that cremation should be encouraged, and notthe present method of burial. Cremation returns the life of the lunar lords morerapidly to the central reservoir of life than any other method, for “our God isa consuming Fire” and all fires have affinity with the central Fire.Let us now study the rule which goes with Law VIII.RULE FIVEThe healer must seek to link his soul, his heart, his brain and his hands. Thuscan he pour the vital healing force upon the patient. This is magnetic work . Itcures [643] disease or increases the evil state, according to the knowledge ofthe healer.The healer must seek to link his soul, his brain, his heart and auric emanation.Thus can his presence feed the soul life of the patient. This is the work ofradiation . The hands are needed not. The soul displays its power. The patient’ssoul responds through the response of his aura to the radiation of the healer’saura, flooded with soul energy.From just casually reading this Rule it will be obvious that its significance isvital to all successful healing work. It sums up the two modes of healing, basedon two capacities of the healer, founded on two groups of related aspects in thehealer’s personality, and indicating two different points in evolution on thepart of the healer. An analysis of this Rule will convey a still greater idea ofits importance, for it indicates not only the lines along which the healer musttrain himself, but also certain interior relationships must be present, andthese are dependent upon the point in evolution of the healer. Again, in onecase the patient’s physical body is the objective of the healing art, whilst inthe other it is the patient’s soul which feels the effect of the healing energy.In the first case the healer works with the prana or vital planetary fluid, andin the other with soul energy.We can therefore, on the basis of this Rule, divide healers into two groups: onegroup wielding the vital etheric fluid which we call prana, and the second groupworking on a much higher level and employing an ability to draw down soul energyinto the body (or rather, the personality) of the healer and—from the requiredcentre—to send it forth again into the appropriate centre in the patient’s body,but this time through the stimulation of the patient’s aura controlled by thepatient’s soul. The two types of energy are of a widely different quality, forone is purely of the personality and is sometimes called animal magnetism ,[644] and the other is of the soul, involving a type of work called radiation.It should be noted here that in reality we have three types of healers:1. The healer who works purely through magnetism and brings to bear the healingvital life of the planetary etheric body as it uses his individual etheric bodyas a channel whereby prana can pour into the vital body of the patient.2. The healer who works on a higher level, and necessarily therefore with ahigher type of patient; he uses the energy of his own overshadowing soul inconjunction with the energy of his individualised soul, and thereby radiates itforth into the soul of the patient, via both of the auras.3. The healer who can employ both techniques and whose range of contacts andpossibilities of usefulness are far greater than the other two. He can employwith equal facility the energy of the soul or the vital pranic force, and hastherefore mastered the two techniques which govern the two sets of relatedfaculties. This class of healer is much rarer than the other two.At present, in the modern world, there is no true system of spiritual healingtaught to would-be healers. There is instead an effort to base the wholeprocedure, plus the techniques employed, on purely mental levels, on systems ofaffirmation, modes of prayer, stimulation of the patient’s will-to-live, andoccasionally the use of magnetic or hypnotic passes in relation to the ethericbody; various forms of applied subjective thinking are taught, but no trueformula for an intelligent and expected cure, only the vague faith of the healerand of the patient and a blind autosuggestion [645] as to what the recognitionand affirmation of divinity ought to produce.True healing, however, is based on certain broad principles which requiredefinite mental acceptance; the methods, nevertheless, which are employed are asdefinitely physical, using the etheric currents and the centres in the ethericbody, as the laying on of hands and the establishing of relations which affectthe physical body, and which are not at all of a mental nature and do notrequire to be appropriated and held by the mind of the patient. The etheric bodyis physical in nature, and this must not be forgotten and needs frequentreiteration. As we have earlier seen, there are three basic principles, affirmedand believed by the healer who is greatly aided if the patient accepts themalso:1. There is no reality in separation. The planetary etheric body is a whole,unbroken and continuous; of this etheric body, those of the healer and thepatient are integral, intrinsic parts.2. There is an unbreakable (though probably unrealised) relationship between thehealer’s etheric body and that of the patient, which can be used when oncecontact has been induced, for a definite circulation of energies.3. The channels of relationship can be conductors of many different types ofenergy, transmitted by the healer to the patient. In this fact lies both hopeand danger.There are other principles, but in connection with this Rule these three areessential and explanatory. Much consequently depends upon the knowledge, theunderstanding and the perceptiveness of the healer. The danger in both radiatoryhealing and magnetic healing consists in the fact that [646] where there is notrained healer, the amount of prana brought in or of soul energy distributed mayproduce death, as well as life. A healer may charge his etheric body with somuch prana and project it so violently into the etheric body of the patient thathe may do far more harm than good. Only long practice can teach the healer theright amount of energy to emit, and to learn this he would do well to use aslittle energy as possible, gradually increasing the quantity as he attains skillin action. Speaking in a broad and general way, and with the reminder that thereare many exceptions to all rules, the magnetic healer will work with lessdeveloped people than will the spiritual healer using soul radiation, and hewill deal primarily with those diseases which are found below the diaphragm.Spiritual healers work primarily with the upper part of the body, through thecentres above the diaphragm and with the head centre, thereby controlling allcentres in the entire body. Their work is most delicate and subtle and involvesfar greater risks. The true healer who is an initiate employs both methods withequal facility.It is interesting, though not particularly useful to you, to point out thatthere are two other classes of healers who are sometimes found. They work quitedifferently to either of the methods mentioned above. They are:1. Certain healers—few and far between—who have set up a relation with thespirit of the earth, the Ruler of all the lunar lords. Under certain formulasand given a certain amount of practice, these healers can invoke his aid and—infact—command it. I do not advise any interested student to ponder overmuch alongthis line or to endeavour to set up a contact or to invoke his aid. Onlyinitiates of high degree can deal safely with this powerful involutionaryElemental; they do so [647] only in connection with epidemics and internationalcatastrophes such as the world war, in which thousands and thousands of bodieswere involved. An individual not highly developed who endeavoured to establishrapport would probably only succeed in stimulating the lunar lords of his ownlittle system to such an extent that his lower nature would be undulyenergised—sometimes even to the point of death.2. Other healers, not as few as in the above group but relatively few, work incooperation with a healing deva. Such devas exist and have the power ofbestowing life. They are to the involutionary lunar lords what the great Livesat Shamballa are to us. They are not a menace to humanity but are not readilyreached, except at a certain stage upon the Path where, symbolically speaking, adoor or point of contact exists between the two evolutions, for the devas arenot upon the involutionary arc. Relations are established through affinity, butthis can be brought about only by the deva, and not by the healer. If the healeris very advanced, his Master may instruct one of the serving devas to aid him.Only healers of great purity and of completely selfless motive can attract theseangels, and when they do, the potency of their healing is much greater; theymake fewer mistakes. They do not, for instance, attempt to heal patients forwhom there is no healing possibility. The Angel of Death (and this time I am notspeaking symbolically but am referring to an existing deva) will not permit ahealing deva to collaborate: they are only permitted to approach where healingis indicated.We might now take the sentences in this Rule and study their meaning, as thereare more significances in them than appear upon the surface. The first sentencein each [648] paragraph of this Rule starts with an important injunction to thehealer:The healer must seek to link his soul, his heart, his brain and his hands. Thuscan he pour the vital healing force upon the patient.This is the technique of the lowest type of true spiritual healer, and for thisreason two of the aspects of the dense physical body are included: the brain andthe hands. The healer works, therefore, through a triangle and two lines ofenergy. The situation can be depicted in the following diagram:[Image00016.jpg]The triangle is completed when the healing work is done and the energy iswithdrawn from the hands to the brain again and from thence returned by an actof the will to the soul. When the healer (through practiced alignment) haslinked up with his soul, he then draws the soul energy down into his heartcentre, from whence he transfers it to the brain, where it is definitelyfocussed. Using the ajna centre as a distributing centre, he then uses his handsas the agency through which the directed energy can reach that area in thepatient’s body where the seat of the trouble is to be found. He passes theenergy into the patient’s approximate centre which governs the distressed area,from which it [649] permeates the surrounding part of the body, penetrating bothto the centre of the trouble and to the limits of the distressed area.There are two ways in which he uses his hands, and two methods which he employs:1. The laying on of hands. This method is employed when the diseased area isstrictly localised. The hands are laid on the centre in spine or head which maygovern that area—the right hand being laid upon the spinal centre and the lefthand on the part of the body immediately in front of the special area and overthe part of the abdomen, chest or head in which the patient complains ofdistress. They are held in this position as long as the healer can hold thetriangle of soul, heart and brain clearly in consciousness.2. The use of the hands in action . Here the healer, having ascertained thedifficulty and then located the needed centre up the spine or in the head,creates a circulation of energy (through the action of his hands) through thecentre in the patient’s body controlling the distressed area, and thenceoutwards through that area towards himself. He uses the right hand first,holding it momentarily over the diseased organ or area and slowly withdraws ittowards himself; he follows this rapidly with the left hand which works in thesame manner. Both hands, you will note, are now being used positively . No partor aspect of the healer’s body or bodies is ever permitted to be negative, andthe fiction that the right hand is positive and the left hand is negative willhave to be discarded. If one hand was negative, the healer would be liable toabsorb into himself those diseased atoms which, when successful, he draws out ofthe area of distress. These do not respond to the action of his [650] handsthrough the medium of the centre in the patient’s body nearest to the seat oftrouble, but are drawn out through the area which has responded to the disease.In the first case, through the laying on of hands, of silent hands, of quiethands, the energy flow is between the two hands, back and forth within thediseased area; the spinal centre is used all the time, and the activity set up,when successful, burns up and absorbs the forces causing the trouble withoutpenetrating the body of the healer. In the second case, the forces are withdrawnby the action of the energy passing through the hands, applied one after theother in a regular time rhythm. They pass through the hands, but are unable tofocus themselves there, owing to the concentration of the healing energieswithin the hands.Healers on the second, third and fifth rays use more generally the mode oflaying on of hands or magnetic healing . This term applies to the direct act oflaying on of hands upon the patient’s physical body, and not to the action ofthe hands in the second method, when the hands are immersed in the etheric bodyof the patient and are definitely working in etheric matter. Healers on thefirst, fourth and seventh rays use the mode of “hand immersion,” as it issometimes called. The sixth ray healer is rare and is successful only whenhighly developed; he will then use both methods interchangeably. All spiritually advanced healers use both hands. Healers are, however, advisedfirst of all to ascertain their ray, and then to perfect themselves in the typeor mode of healing best suited to that ray; then, when adequately efficient andable to use facility and skill, they can add the mode of healing which is not soadaptable to their ray type. People on the sixth ray are advised to abstain fromthe healing art until they have arrived (consciously) at the [651] initiatestage. When both modes of magnetic healing have been mastered, the healer mayemploy both alternately in the act of healing, or he may use the mode ofmagnetic passes first so as to set up a changed activity in the diseased area,and then finally use a definite laying on of hands.At the close of the healing period the “sealing of the triangle” takes place.The energy, hitherto passing into the hands through the ajna centre from thebrain, is withdrawn into the ajna centre, and from thence directed—by an act ofthe will—to the soul. The healing force is literally “turned off” andredirected; it is no longer available.During the entire period of healing the healer says nothing. He is making noaffirmation and uses no healing mantram. The process outlined here is that ofthe effect of energy or soul potency playing upon force. This is a point to beemphasised. The task of the healer is to preserve an attitude of intenseconcentration upon the triangle “existing in living lines of energy” (as it hasbeen called) within his own fourfold aura—health aura, etheric body, astral bodyand mental body. This he must preserve intact and stable for the entire periodof healing. Soul-heart-brain must be linked in such a “lighted” manner that atrue clairvoyant would see a brilliant triangle in the healer’s aura; thehighest point of the triangle (that of the soul) he might fail to see unless hewere himself highly developed, but he could not fail to see the signs of it inthe inflowing energy to the heart and from the heart to the brain. The work doneis silent work. There is therefore no loss of power at any time, as there alwaysis through the spoken word or affirmation. It is not possible to hold thetriangle geometrically correct and magnetically polarised if there is any soundmade by the healer. This presupposes an advanced stage of alignment and ofconcentration and will [652] indicate to you some of the lines along which thehealer’s training should go.This mode of healing “cures disease or increases the evil state, according tothe knowledge of the healer.” In some respects (though this is a stage ofhealing which is not the highest) it is nevertheless the one most responsiblebecause, in the case of radiatory healing, the soul of the patient is working incooperation with the healer and it is the soul then which has the majorresponsibility. In magnetic healing, the healer needs to cooperate closely withthe patient’s physician or surgeon dealing with the case; he will supply thetechnical knowledge, and thus prevent the healer from making mistakes.Where death is definitely indicated and the “signs of death” are noted by boththe doctor and the healer, the healer has not need to stop his work. Bycontinuing it, he may increase the evil condition, but will nevertheless beaiding the patient by hastening normally the act of dying. The old proverb isbasically not true in all cases, that “where there is life there is hope.” Lifecan and often is prolonged after the will of the soul is towards the withdrawalof the soul life; the life of the atoms of the lunar lords can be fostered for along time, and this greatly distresses the spiritual man who is aware of theprocess and the intent of his soul. What is kept alive is the physical body, butthe interest of the true man is no longer focussed there.There inevitably comes a point, for instance in the case of malignant disease,where the physician knows that it simply is a question of time, and thespiritual healer can learn to recognise the same signs. Then, instead of thepresent silence on the part of both healer and doctor, where the patient isconcerned, this remaining time will be employed (if the patient’s facultiespermit) with due preparation or the “beneficent and happy withdrawal” of thesoul; the patient’s [653] family and friends will share in the preparation. Inthe early stages of the new world religion, this attitude towards death will beinculcated. An entirely new concept of death, with the emphasis upon consciouswithdrawal, will be taught, and funeral services, or rather the crematoryservices, will be joyous events because their emphasis will be upon release andreturn.The magnetic work, however, will cure if the patient’s destiny indicates it, ifthe soul intends to prolong the life cycle unexpectedly in order to fulfill someduty, or if the patient is very far advanced spiritually and the Hierarchyrequires his services for a longer term.Let us now consider radiatory healing.We shall now be dealing with a very different situation than that of the one wehave just been considering. In radiatory healing, the patient (eitherconsciously or unconsciously) is working with the healer and is cooperating withhim. The basic premise in radiatory healing is that the patient is a person whohas, at least to some degree, established rapport with his soul. This havingbeen brought about, the healer knows that a channel of contact can be countedupon and that the soul interest can be evoked in its representative, the manupon the physical plane. He knows also that success in radiatory healing isdependent, to a great extent, upon the ability of his own soul to establish afirm relation with the soul of the patient. When the patient is conscious andable to cooperate, the work is greatly helped; according to the healer’scapacity to avail himself of alignment and recognised contact will be thequality of the aid he will be able to give to the one who needs his assistance.When the patient is unconscious, even that provides no real hindrance, providedthe healer can bring his soul and the patient’s soul into relationship; in [654]fact in some cases the unconsciousness of the patient can be a help, for tooearnest, emphatic and impatient help can offset the work—quiet, silent andcontrolled—by the healer.Once, however, the rapport is established, the work of the healer simplyconsists in holding the relationship steady; no interference must be permittedin the work being done by the patient’s soul, set in motion by the aid of thehealer. The Master Jesus on the Cross could not respond to any saving process(even had He desired to do so) because the soul body—as is always the case atthe fourth initiation—was destroyed; there was nothing to respond to theevocative power of an outside person, interested or loving. As an adept and asone in whom monadic consciousness was firmly established, the powers thenavailable to Jesus could not be used in the saving of His physical body. At thesame time, it must be remembered that He would have no desire to save it,because He now possessed the power (demonstrated later in the Gospel story) tocreate a body at will in order to meet His needs. The subtle and subjective sinof the apostles was that they were not interested in evoking the living activityof the Master on His Own behalf (even though He would never do so; this they didnot know), but were entirely preoccupied with their own grief. The evocation,had they attempted it, would have been useless, but the good that might havecome to them and the revelation they might have received as to the deathlessnessof the soul would have greatly illuminated them and might have produced aChristianity built around a living Christ and not around a dead Christ.In radiatory healing, we are told that “the healer must seek to link his soul,his brain, his heart and auric emanation.” You will note two points connectedwith this particular instruction which differ from that given in the case ofmagnetic healing: [655]1. The order of the triangle of energies created is different.2. The means of contact are subtle and not tangible.The energy released follows a direct line of contact with the brain, and thehealer starts with a closed triangle and not with an open one, as in the case ofmagnetic healing. The triangle created is a simple one, and there is no physicalcontact and outlet as in magnetic healing:[Image00017.jpg]The brain of the healer is involved, but there is no physical contact of anykind with the patient. The result is a constant circulation of force from thesoul back again to the soul. This causes necessarily an augmenting and anenergising of the threefold personality of the healer, and therefore of hisauric emanation. His aura would be seen by a clairvoyant as greatly extended, inrapid motion, and energised by light from his own soul, but with all itsradiation turned in the direction of the patient. By this means the healingforce of the healer stimulates all the three personality vehicles of thepatient; the patient’s soul is aided in the work it has to do. The healer willconsequently find it necessary to stand at that side of the patient in which thetrouble is located, so that the radiation of his aura can more easily penetrate.This is the easiest way, but not the most effective. Where the patient’svitality is strong, he [656] should lie on the side, and the healer should standbehind the patient so that the energy pouring through, which the healer may beusing and which is potently energising his aura with soul energy, may affect thepatient’s aura and thus facilitate the entry of the healing radiation, which thehealer is contributing, to the centre or centres needed. Where the patient isvery highly developed, the healer should stand at the patient’s head. Hispersonal effect is not then so great, but that does not matter because it is notneeded; the soul of the patient will be adequate to the task. All that is neededis that the aura of the healer, blending with that of the patient, creates azone of quiet rhythmic activity around the head centre. No physical contact bythe hands is now required, and the healer must on no account touch the patient.The situation is summed up for us in the words: “Thus can his presence feed thesoul life of the patient. This is the work of radiation. The hands are needednot.”Speaking symbolically, it is almost as if a great vortex of power were set up bythe contact between the two auras and by their high vibration: by its means thesoul of the patient can work more easily. An initiate, if present, would see agolden stream of energy pouring straight down through the energised bodies ofthe patient’s personality into the centre nearest to the area of trouble.Approach is made via the head centre directly to the point of difficulty, andtowards this point the aura of the healer is also directed. The mental attitudeof the patient is strengthened and clarified by the mental emanation of thehealer’s aura; his emotional reaction, often very powerful, is equally aided toattain dispassion and quiet, and the etheric and health auras have a definiteeffect upon the corresponding aspects of the patient’s aura.[657] Radiatory healing is brought about by the mingling of the two auras, bothof them responsive to soul contact; the soul aspect of both persons (undercontrol of the soul) is then directed towards some area of the patient’sphysical body. This produces a tremendous effect upon the diseased area, and thecentre in that same locality becomes exceedingly energised. The work of thehealer during this process is one of intense quiescence. Having made hiscontact, he simply waits and has nothing more to do but to hold his soulalignment steady and permit nothing to disturb his personality vehicles. Histask was accomplished when he made his own soul contact and then reached out andcontacted the patient’s soul. This he could do because he knows all souls areone: eventually the art of healing will be one of the demonstrating factors inproving the unity of all souls.This rule, therefore, concludes with the words: “The patient’s soul respondsthrough the response of his aura to the radiation of the healer’s aura, Floodedwith soul energy.” It is consequently a question of the soul energy of bothparties meeting on all three levels of human awareness. The expression “thesoul” is here in the singular because unity (if only for a moment) has beenreached. The soul of the patient recognises this unity by the “occultquickening” of his own aura and by its responsiveness to the entering radiationsfrom the healer’s aura. This flooding with soul energy through the medium ofrelated auras is, all of it, directed as one unified effort towards the area ofdisease in the patient’s body. You can see, therefore, that-consciously orunconsciously-the work can go forward and produce either healing or that“quickening of atoms which leads by soul direction unto release,” as the Oldcommentary calls the act of dying.When it becomes evident that it is the patient’s destiny to die, the techniqueof the healer alters somewhat. He [658] then takes his place at the patient’shead, and from that point deflects all his own radiations to the seat of thedisease, causing necessarily a great acceleration of vibratory activity. Thepatient, in the meantime, consciously through brain recognition or unconsciouslyunder soul direction, begins the process of withdrawing all consciousness fromthe body. This is why so many people are in a coma prior to death. When this actof the withdrawal of consciousness has been started, the work of the healerends. He “shuts off” his soul contact and reassumes control of his aura as amedium of his own spiritual expression; it becomes no longer an instrument forhealing by radiatory activity, and leaves the patient alone automatically tocomplete the withdrawal of the consciousness thread and the life thread, fromthe head and heart centres.This is a broad and general outline of the processes followed in magnetic andradiatory healing. I have here given you the skeleton structure of the idea, butnot the details; more can be inferred and given when we study the seven methodsof healing with their ray implications.This teaching has been given in such a manner that the student will have to huntthrough its pages and gather together the facts needed, and thus formulate thefirst stage of the procedure of spiritual healing; unless he is himself aspiritual healer and ready to read between the lines and to distinguish betweensymbolism and fact, he will be misled and his work rendered useless. This isintended; for the healing art—when perfectly applied under correct formulas—canbe dangerous. It must be remembered that although energy is thought, it is also,from a higher point of view, fire. The entire technique, procedure, and formulaswill have to be discovered, subjected to experiment and the results noted beforethe true spiritual healing can take place; [659] by the time this investigationhas been completed, it will be a safer matter than it is today. In the meantime,much good can be accomplished and a great deal learnt if those interested read,study, meditate, carefully experiment, and thus gradually build up this muchneeded science as a co-partner in the medical science of modern times.Let us now consider Law IX.In Law IX and Rule Six we shall be dealing with such basic fundamentals that ourproblem will be to formulate the teaching in such a concise manner that vastthemes may be briefly handled, and at the same time appear clear and simple.This law is in reality a definition of the Law of Evolution, but given from thespiritual angle. The Law of Evolution—as commonly understood—concerns theevolution of the form aspect as it is gradually fitted to be an exponent or anexpression of soul energy, and later of monadic energy.This law, which might be termed the Law of Perfection, deals with the interiorenergies which are responsible for the working of the Law of Evolution. It isthe higher aspect or the determining cause of the lower; the laws subsidiary tothe Law of Perfection are loosely called (by the neophyte) the spiritual laws,but of these he knows little and unifies them all in his mind under the generalidea that they are an expression of the love aspect of Deity. That isessentially true, from the quality angle, if it is recognised at the same timethat the love aspect is essentially pure reason and not an emotional sentimentexpressing itself through kind actions.The rule which accompanies this law deals with the relation of love and will,and is consequently of high importance to the initiate. I would remind you herethat the [660] only true healer is the initiate, and therefore the last two laws(Law IX and Law X) can only be truly understood by the initiated disciple. Theyare, however, profoundly interesting intellectually to the beginner, theenquirer and the aspirant, because (theoretically at least) he can grasp some oftheir meaning, though he is as yet quite incapable of “keeping thelaw”—spiritually understood.LAW IXPerfection calls imperfection to the surface. Good drives evil from the form ofman in time and space. The method used by the Perfect One and that employed byGood, is “perfect harmlessness”. This is not negativity, but Perfect Poise, acompleted point of view, and divine understanding.This law is profoundly simple and means exactly what it says. It can beinterpreted in two ways:1. It concerns the spiritual development of man through the medium of form, andthe mode or law whereby the latent hold of matter—impregnated by selfishness andby all that is recognised as evil—is removed, and man stands free.2. It can also be interpreted in terms of healer and patient. Oft the effect ofthe activity and knowledge of the true healer is to bring to the surface (in anacute form) the evil (disease) within the form. The result of this can either bethe elimination of the disease and the securing of health, or the form willsuccumb to the increase of the difficulty and the probability is that thepatient will die. It is therefore fortunate that the average healer is so futilethat such a dire possibility is not present!The method employed under the Law of Perfection is called “perfectharmlessness,” and that was ever the method used [661] by the Christ, thePerfect One. It is not the harmlessness enjoined so often by me as I speak toaspirants, but a harmlessness imposed by the spiritual man and by his naturaldestiny. It is an ignoring of the effect or the result upon the form nature.Frequently I have told you that the Hierarchy works only with the spiritualnature or with the soul of humanity, and that—to the Master—the form is regardedas relatively of no importance. Release from the threefold form is ever regardedby the spiritual man as the greatest possible good, provided it comes to himunder law, as the result of his spiritual destiny and of karmic decision: itmust not come as an arbitrary act, or as an escape from life and itsconsequences upon the physical plane, or as self-imposed. Of this strangeworking of the Law of Perfection (strange to man’s limited point of view), thewar (1914-1945) was a striking instance. Millions died; more millions sufferedcruelly in their form nature, and many more millions underwent (and are stillundergoing) the mental agony of insecurity, suspense and poverty. Nevertheless,two major results of a spiritual nature, working under the Law of Perfection,resulted:1. Souls were released from a backward and decaying civilisation—for such isyour vaunted civilisation from the angle of the Hierarchy—and will return inbetter bodies to a civilisation and a culture more in conformity with the needsof the spiritual man. The main reason why there has been such a completedestruction of the old forms (physical, emotional and mental) is that theyconstituted a complete imprisonment of the soul and negated all true growth forthe masses of men.2. From the rich to the poor, from the intelligent to the ignorant, one thing isnow clearly grasped and will increasingly colour human thinking: happiness and[662] success are not dependent upon the possession of things or upon materialgood. That idea is the mistake of organised labour as it fights and strikes formore money in order to live more richly; it is also the mistake of the generalpublic as it reacts to the action of labour, for it rebels against thecurtailment of the steady inflow of material goods. Humanity has made thismistake for untold ages, and has erred grievously in its emphasis upon thatwhich benefits the form. This is the good in the Russian position as it wars oncapitalism and lays an emphasis upon education. However, its ruthlessness andcruelty and (above all else) its suppression of the rights of the individualcitizen to certain of the essential freedoms may eventually negate the beautyand the hope of the initial idealism. Russia is right in her idealism, butterribly and basically wrong in her techniques. The United States and GreatBritain are at a midway point. They have a vision but know not how tomaterialise it and make it true, for they favour not (and rightly) atotalitarian regime. The capitalistic spirit and the latent fascism of theUnited States are at this time a definite menace to world peace, and thecapitalists are blocking the efforts of the men of goodwill. Great Britain is atpresent impotent, financially ruined, her old imperialistic policies entirely inthe discard, and her people discouraged: she is therefore so preoccupied withthe struggle to live (and she will live) that there is little time, interest orenergy left to make the vision true.There is, as you know, always a correspondence between the individual man andthe world of men as a whole. Just as today practically every human being hassomething wrong with him physically—eyes, ears, teeth or bodily ills of some[663] nature—so humanity is sick and awaiting healing. The healing will bebrought about through the medium of the New Group of World Servers and by themen of goodwill, aided by the Hierarchy, from which planetary centre the healingenergies will be drawn. Imperfection has been drawn to the surface; the evils tobe eliminated are known to everybody, and this has all taken place under theinfluence of the Law of Perfection. I am dealing here with the general situationrather than with the individual relation between the healer and a patient. I doso for the simple reason that only an initiate of experience and ofunderstanding can keep this law or obey this rule, and of such there are only avery few on earth today. The sickness of humanity as a race, and as a result ofaeons of wrong living, of selfish purpose and of greed, has produced a mass ofphysical ills; today millions of children are born either openly diseased orwith the seed of disease in them. When the evil which has made its presencefelt, and when the imperfections which have been drawn to the surface have beencured or driven back to their own place, then—and only then—will physicaldisease come to an end or yield easily to treatment.In considering the general subject of imperfection and of evil, we are dealinghere with causes (and this the initiate must ever do); when these causes arethemselves removed, then the effects will also disappear. Christian Science andUnity are therefore right in their general theory and premises, but totallywrong in their emphases and methods. In the long run, all the work they do todayis relatively futile, except in so far that they preserve and enunciate the Lawof Perfection, even though they do so in a muddled manner and their teaching istainted with the universal selfishness.[664] You have oft been told that there are two modes of achievement; the longhard way of evolution, in which aeons are taken to arrive at relatively smallresults, or the short, still harder but much more rapid way of initiation. Forages it remained a question (a moot point, do you not call it?) whether theworld of men would choose (and had better choose) the slow but safe method. Itis a method in which imperfection is only very gradually eliminated, withoutmuch strain and with small effort on the part of man. It is a mode whereby goodis only slowly realised and evil only slowly, very slowly, driven out. Thewill-to-good of Shamballa is, under the usual evolutionary system, only faintlypresent, and many, many aeons would still lie ahead of humanity before even thepresent point of human development could have been attained.But something happened which had not been foreseen even by the Hierarchy. Duringthe past two hundred years the entire picture has been altered. Individual men,in adequate numbers, achieved initiation and entered the Ashrams of the Masters,and through the decision of these successful aspirants, and subject to theircontinued activity, it was decided by them but for humanity that the rapid hardway was to be tried. Since that time three factors have been present:1. The factor of tremendous progress in raising the consciousness of mankind, enmasse, to much higher intellectual levels. To this the growth of education, thediscoveries of science and the control of the material plane and of the air beartestimony.2. The factor of worldwide distress, of economic disaster, of world wars, ofnatural cataclysms and of the myriad occurrences and difficulties which makeindividual life, national life and planetary life so hard these days. No one isexempt and there is no distinction shown. [665]3. The factor of the growth of knowledge anent the Hierarchy and, above allelse, of the spiritual Plan. This has necessitated the presentation of a goal toman by the working aspirants and disciples, plus the outlining of the techniquesof the Path whereby that goal can be reached. This has not been accomplished bythe religious church groups throughout the world, but by members of the Ashrams.All that the churches have done is to preserve in the public mind the fact ofGod Transcendent, whilst ignoring the fact of God Immanent, to testify to theexistence of the Christ whilst travestying His teaching, and to teach the factof immortality, whilst ignoring the Law of Rebirth.Humanity is, therefore, progressing rapidly upon the Upward Way, and two thingscan be looked for as a consequence: first, that the imperfections and evil (onelatent and the other active though retreating) will become increasingly apparentto intelligent man, and secondly, that the mode of their elimination will alsobecome known.I deal not here with the nature of imperfection or the purpose of evil. Do Ineed to point out to any of my readers how inescapably both are present? I mightpoint out that imperfection is inherent in the nature of matter itself andconstitutes an inheritance from a previous solar system. I might indicate thatevil emanates from that hierarchy of evil Forces which are the materialcorrespondence to the spiritual Hierarchy; this is related to the fact that allour planes are composed of substance of the cosmic physical plane. It might alsobe stated that when the imperfection of matter is realised and corrected, andwhen the interest and emphasis of humanity is turned away from materialconditions, then the Forces of Evil will have nothing in the three worlds (thethree lower levels of the cosmic physical plane) [666] upon which to work; therewill be nothing they can influence, and no mode of influencing man will thenexist as far as evil is concerned. I cannot expect you at this time tocomprehend the meaning of my words. They are, however, related to the words inthe Great Invocation which say, “and seal the door where evil dwells.” There isa door into an evil realm and into blackness, just as there is a door into aworld of goodness and light; the devil is to man who is dedicated andconsecrated to evil what the Dweller on the Threshold is to the spiritualaspirant.The main task of the spiritual Hierarchy has ever been to stand between theForces of Evil and humanity, to bring imperfection into the light so that evilcan “find no place” for action, and to keep the door open into the spiritualrealm. This the Hierarchy has done, with small help from humanity; thissituation is now changed and the world war was the symbol and the guarantee ofthat change; in it the Forces of Light, the massed United Nations, fought theForces of Evil upon the physical plane and routed them. There has been a fargreater spiritual significance to the war than has yet been realised. It markeda world turning point; it reoriented humanity towards the good; it drove backthe Forces of Evil and made definitely clear (and this was new and needed) thetrue distinction between good and evil, and this not in a theological sense—asstated by the church commentators—but practically and obviously. It is evidencedby the disastrous economic situation and by the greed of prominent men in everycountry. The world of men (through the obviousness of the distinction betweengood and evil) has awakened to the fact of materialistic exploitation, to thelack of real freedom and to the rights, as yet unclaimed, of the individual.Man’s ability to resist slavery has become apparent everywhere. That thestrugglers towards freedom are employing wrong methods and are endeavouring[667] oft to fight evil with evil is entirely true, but this indicates onlytransitional techniques and a temporary phase; it is temporary from the point ofview of the Hierarchy (though possibly long from the angle of men in the threeworlds), but it need not necessarily be long today.So great has been the progress of man during the past two hundred years that theCouncil Chamber at Shamballa was forced to take notice. As a result of thisattention by the Great Lives around Sanat Kumara and Their interest in theaffairs of men, two things happened:1. The will aspect of divinity made its first definite and direct contact withthe human mind. The impact was direct and not deflected—as had hitherto been thecase—to the Hierarchy and from thence to humanity. According to the type of manor group who responded or reacted to this contact, so were the results; theywere very good or exceedingly bad. Great and good men appeared and enunciatedthe truths needed for the New Age, and of these Lincoln, Roosevelt, Browning,Briand and a host of lesser men could be cited. Evil and pernicious men alsoemerged, such as Hitler and the group he gathered around him, bringing much evilupon the Earth.2. At the same time, the will-to-good from Shamballa evoked the latent goodwillin man, so that today and increasingly over the past one hundred years, goodnessof heart, kindness in action, consideration for others and mass action topromote human welfare have spread over the Earth.The emergence of imperfection and the planned effort of evil have beenparalleled by the appearance of the New Group of World Servers and by thepreparation which the Hierarchy is making towards its externalisation upon the[668] physical plane. The Hierarchy is at this time exceedingly powerful; itsAshrams are full of initiates and disciples, and its periphery or magnetic fieldis drawing countless thousands of aspirants towards it. The war struck a mortalblow to material evil, and its hold on humanity is greatly weakened.Confound not evil with the activities of the gangster or the criminal. Criminalsand gangsters are the result of the emerging massed imperfections: they are thevictims of ignorance, mishandling when children and misunderstanding down theages of right human relations; the Law of Rebirth will eventually lead them onthe way to good. Those men are truly evil who seek to enforce a return to thebad old ways, who endeavour to keep their fellowmen in slavery of some kind oranother, who block the expression of one or all of the Four Freedoms, who gainmaterial riches at the expense of the exploited, or who seek to hold forthemselves and for gain the produce of the earth, and thus make the cost oflife’s necessities prohibitive to those not richly endowed. Those who thus work,think and plan are to be found in every nation, and are usually of prominencebecause of their riches and influence; however, they sin against light and notthrough ignorance; their goals are material and not spiritual. They arerelatively few compared to the countless millions of men, but are exceedinglypowerful; they are highly intelligent but unscrupulous, and it is through themthat the Forces of Evil work, holding back progress, promoting poverty, breedinghatred and class distinctions, fostering racial differences for their own ends,and keeping ignorance in power. Their sin is great and it is hard for them tochange, because power and the will-to-power (as it militates against thewill-to-good) is a dominant all-controlling factor in their lives; these men aretoday working against the unity of the United Nations, [669] through theirgreed, their determination to own the resources of the earth (such as oil,mineral wealth and food) and thus keep the people weak and with inadequate food.These men, who are found in every nation, thoroughly understand each other andare working together in great combines to exploit the riches of the earth at theexpense of humanity.Russia is today singularly free of such men, so I refer not here to that vastcountry, as many of her enemies might surmise. Russia is making great mistakes,but they are the mistakes of a fanatical ideologist or of a gangster who sinsbecause of ignorance, through immaturity or in fury at the evil things withwhich he is surrounded. This is something totally different to the evil withwhich I have been dealing, and it will not last, because Russia will learn;these others do not learn.I have used the above illustration so as to make my theme somewhat clearer. Thewhole problem of evil is, however, too vast to contemplate here, nor is itadvisable or wise to discuss the source of evil (not of imperfection), the BlackLodge. Energy follows thought, and the spoken word can be potently evocative:therefore, until one is a member of the Great White Lodge, it is the part ofwisdom to avoid consideration of forces potent enough intelligently to use thelatent imperfection in humanity and to impose the vast evil of war, with all itsresults and far-reaching effects, upon humanity. The Black Lodge is the problemof the White Lodge, and not the problem of humanity. For aeons the Hierarchy hashandled this problem, and is now in process of solving it. It is essentially,however, the main consideration and problem of Shamballa, for it is connectedwith the will aspect, and only the will-to-good will suffice to blot out andannihilate the will-to-evil. Goodwill will not suffice, though the united andinvocative appeal of the [670] men of goodwill throughout the world—increasinglyvoiced through the Great Invocation—will serve “to seal the door where evildwells.”It is behind that door and in dealing with the forces there concealed (andmobilised) that the Hierarchy is effective; the methods and modes whereby Theyprotect humanity from mobilised evil, and are gradually driving the evil back,would not be understood by you who have not yet passed through the door whichleads to the Way of the Higher Evolution.What shall I say concerning harmlessness? It is not easy for me to show or proveto you the effectiveness of the higher aspect, spiral or phase of harmlessnessas employed by the Hierarchy, under the direction of the Perfect One, theChrist. The harmlessness with which I have earlier dealt has relation to theimperfections with which humanity is wrestling, and is difficult for you toapply in and under all circumstances, as well you know. The harmlessness towhich I refer in connection with you is not negative, or sweet or kindlyactivity, as so many believe; it is a state of mind and one which in no waynegates firm or even drastic action; it concerns motive and involves thedetermination that the motive behind all activity is goodwill. That motive mightlead to positive and sometimes disagreeable action or speech, but asharmlessness and goodwill condition the mental approach, nothing can eventuatebut good.On a higher turn of the spiral, the Hierarchy also employs harmlessness, but itis related to the will-to-good and involves the use of dynamic, electric energyunder intuitive direction; this type of energy is never brought into activity byman; it is energy which he cannot yet handle. This type of harmlessness is basedon complete self-sacrifice, wherein the will-to-sacrifice, the will-to-good andthe will-to-power (three phases of the will aspect, as expressed through the[671] Spiritual Triad) are all fused into one dynamic energy of a deeplyspiritual nature. This energy is the epitome of complete or perfectharmlessness, where humanity and the subsidiary kingdoms in nature areconcerned, but it is expulsive in its effect and dynamic in its annihilatingimpact, where the Forces of Evil are concerned.A close but esoteric study of the three temptations of the Christ will revealthree major occasions when the Perfect One, expressing this higher harmlessness,forced the exponent of evil to retreat. This triple episode is symbolicallyrelated, but is factual in nature. Little thought has ever been given to whatwould have been the worldwide effect down the centuries if the Christ had notreacted as He did; speculation is of little use, but it might be stated that theentire course of history and of the evolutionary progress of humanity would havebeen altered, and in a dire and awful manner. But the dynamic harmlessness, theexpression of the will-to-good and the demonstration of the will-to-power(forcing evil to leave Him) marked a most important crisis in the life of theChrist. The Gospel story (with its resume of the five initiations) concerns the progressand triumph of the Master Jesus; the story of the three temptations indicatedthe taking of a still higher initiation, the sixth, by the Christ; thisconferred on Him complete mastery over evil, and not mastery over imperfection;it was because He was the “Perfect One” that He could take this initiation.I have given you much for mature consideration and thrown some light upon aninitiation of which little, naturally, can be known. I would call your attentionalso to the three fundamental requirements for a successful approach to thisinitiation: perfect poise, a completed point of view and divine understanding.You would find it of interest to see how these three qualities work out inrelation to the [672] three temptations; in so doing much light would be thrownon the life, nature and character of the Christ.Under the Law of Perfection we are given the key to the civilisation and cycleof evolution which He inaugurated—the ideal of which is not lost, though theapplication of the teaching He gave has been neglected by the churches and bymankind. You will note also that one temptation takes place on the summit of ahigh mountain; from that elevation both time and space are totally negated, forthe vision of Christ ranged from the past, through the present and on into thefuture. This state of awareness (I cannot call it consciousness, and awarenessis almost as inaccurate a word) is only possible after the fifth initiation,reaching a high point of expression at the sixth initiation.I would like to consider with you the nature of the three requirements presentedas essential for a certain initiation, because they provide the link between LawIX and Rule Six. The rule is so clear and concise that it needs but littleexplanation, emphasising, as it does, energy which must be used and that whichmust not. It says:RULE SIXThe healer or the healing group must keep the will in leash. It is not willwhich must be used, but love.These three basic requirements concern attainment on various planes of theuniverse; though I dealt with them in connection with the approach to the sixthinitiation, they have— on a lower turn of the spiral—their correspondences, andare therefore of practical application by the initiated disciple, particularlyone who has taken the third initiation. Let us take them, one by one, into ourthinking:Perfect Poise indicates complete control of the astral body, so that emotionalupheavals are overcome, or at [673] least are greatly minimised in the life ofthe disciple. It indicates also, on the higher turn of the spiral, an ability tofunction freely on buddhic levels, owing to complete liberation (and consequentpoise) from all the influences and impulses which are motived from the threeworlds. This type or quality of poise connotes—if you will think deeply—anabstract state of mind; nothing which is regarded as nonperfection can createdisturbance. You can realise surely that, if you were entirely free from allemotional reactions, your clarity of mind and your ability to think clearlywould be enormously increased, with all that that involvesNaturally, the perfect poise of an initiated disciple and that of the initiatedMaster are different, for one concerns the effect of the three worlds or theirnon-effect, and the other concerns adaptability to the rhythm of the SpiritualTriad; nevertheless, the earlier type of poise must precede the laterachievement, hence my consideration of the subject. This perfect poise (which isa possible achievement for you who read) is arrived at by ruling out the pulls,the urges, impulses and attractions of the astral or emotional nature, and alsoby the practice of what I have earlier mentioned: Divine Indifference.A Completed Point of View . This necessarily and primarily refers to theuniversal outlook of the Monad, and therefore to an initiate of the higherdegrees. It can, however, be interpreted on a lower rung of the ladder ofevolution and refers to the function of the soul as an Observer in the threeworlds and the completed all-round picture such an observer gradually attains.This is brought about by the development of the two qualities of detachment anddiscrimination. These two qualities, [674] when expressed on the Way to theHigher Evolution, become Abstraction and the Will-to-good.A completed point of view—as experienced on soul levels—indicates the removal ofall barriers and the freedom of the disciple from the great heresy ofseparateness; he has therefore created an unclogged channel for the inflow ofpure love. Perfect poise, viewed from the same level, has removed allimpediments and those emotional factors which have hitherto blocked the channel,thus preparing the way for the Observer to see truly; the disciple thenfunctions as a clear channel for love.Divine Understanding must also be studied from two points of view. As a soulquality, it indicates a mind which can be held steady in the light, and cantherefore reflect the pure reason (pure love) which qualifies the reflections ofthe Son of Mind, the soul on its own plane. On the higher Way of the Master, itrelates to that identification which supersedes the individualisticconsciousness; all barriers have gone, and the initiate sees things as they are;he knows the causes of which all phenomena are the ephemeral effects. This,consequently, enables Him to understand the Purpose, as it emanates fromShamballa, just as the lesser initiate understands the Plan as it is formulatedby the Hierarchy.All three of these divine attributes are, in some measure, essential in thedevelopment of the initiate-healer; he must work at their unfoldment as part ofhis necessary equipment; he must know that all reactions of an emotional naturecreate a wall or barrier between the free flow of healing force and the patient,and that the barrier is created by him and not by the patient. The emotions ofthe [675] patient should have no effect upon the healer and should fail todeviate him from the intense concentration needed for his work; these emotionsof the patient cannot in themselves create a barrier strong enough to deflectthe healing force.A completed point of view involves at least the attempt by the disciple topenetrate into the world of causes, and thus learn (if possible) what it is thatis responsible for the disease of the patient. This need not involve penetrationinto previous incarnations, nor is that essential, in spite of what some modernand generally fraudulent healers may claim. There is usually enoughpsychological evidence, or indications of inherited tendencies, to give thehealer his clue and to enable him to get a somewhat complete picture of thesituation. It is obvious that this “penetration” into the causes of the troublewill only be possible if the healer loves enough; because he loves, he hasachieved a poise which brings negation to the world of illusion and of glamour.Divine understanding is simply the application of the principle of pure love(pure reason) to all men and to all circumstances, plus right interpretation ofthe existing difficulties of the patient, or of those which may exist betweenpatient and healer.To these requirements I would like to add another factor: that of the doctor,physician or surgeon who is physically responsible for the patient. In thecoming new era, the healer will work always with the scientific aid of thetrained medical man; this is a factor which causes bewilderment, at present, tothe average modern healer belonging to some cult or expressing some unorthodoxphase of healing.It will therefore be apparent how these three divine requirements (when steppeddown for the use of the disciple in the modern world) indicate a line oftraining or of self-discipline [676] to which all should apply themselves. Whenthey have mastered even some of the earliest phases of this triple achievement,they will find that they can apply Rule Six with ease.What is meant by the words “to keep the will in leash”? The will aspect hereconsidered is not that of the will-to-good and its lower expression goodwill.The will-to-good signifies the stable, immovable orientation of the initiateddisciple, whilst goodwill can be regarded as its expression in daily service.The will-to-good, as expressed by a higher initiate, is a dynamic energy havingpredominantly a group effect; for this reason, the higher initiates seldomconcern themselves with the healing of an individual. Their work is too potentand too important to permit them to do so, and the will energy, embodying as itdoes divine Purpose, might prove destructive in its effects upon an individual.The patient would not be able to receive or absorb it. It is, however, assumedthat goodwill colours the entire attitude and thinking of the healing disciple.The will which must be kept in leash is the will of the personality which, inthe case of the initiated disciple, is of a very high order. It also relates tothe will of the soul, emanating from the petals of sacrifice in the egoic lotus.All true healers have to create a healing thoughtform, and through this theyconsciously or unconsciously work. It is this thoughtform which must be keptfree from a too powerful use of the will, for it can (unless held in leash,stepped down, modified or, if needed, eliminated altogether) destroy not onlythe thoughtform created by the healer, but it can also build a barrier betweenhealer and patient; the initial rapport is thus broken. Only a Christ can healby the use of the will, and He seldom in reality healed at all; in the caseswhere He is reported to have done so, His reason was to prove the possibility ofhealing; but—as you will [677] note if you are familiar with the Gospel story—Hegave no instructions to His disciples upon the art of healing. This issignificant.The self-will (no matter of how high a quality) of the healer, and hisdetermined effort to heal the patient, create a tension in the healer which canseriously deflect the healing current of energy. When this type of will ispresent, as it frequently is in the inexperienced healer or the non-initiatedhealer, the healer is apt to absorb the patient’s difficulty and will experiencesymptoms of the trouble and the pain. His willful determination to be of helpacts like a boomerang and he suffers, whilst the patient is not really helped.So the instruction is to use love, and here a major difficulty emerges. How canthe healer use love, freed from its emotional or lower quality, and bring itthrough in its pure state for the healing of the patient? Only as the healer hascultivated the three requirements, and has therefore developed himself as a purechannel. He is apt to be so preoccupied with himself, with the definition oflove, and with the determination to heal the patient that the three requirementsare neglected. Then both he and the patient are wasting each other’s time. Heneed not brood or worry about the nature of pure love, or endeavour too ardentlyto understand how pure reason and pure love are synonymous terms, or whether hecan show sufficient love to effect a healing. Let him ponder on the threerequirements, particularly the first, and let him fulfill within himself thesethree requirements as far as in him lies and his point in evolution permits. Hewill then become a pure channel and the hindrances to the inflow of pure lovewill be automatically removed for “as a man thinketh in his heart so is he”;then, without obstruction or difficulty pure love will pour through him and thepatient will be healed—if such is the law for him.[678] We come now to the final and the most mysterious law of all that I havegiven you. I called your attention to it earlier, and there pointed out thatthis “last law is an enunciation of a new law which is substituted for the Lawof Death, and which has reference only to those found upon the later stages ofthe Path of Discipleship and the stages upon the Path of Initiation.” By theselater stages I refer to the period after the second initiation and prior totaking the third. This law does not apply in any way as long as the emotionalnature can disturb the clear rhythm of the personality as it responds to theimpact of soul energy, and later to monadic. There is not, therefore, a greatdeal that I can make clear to you as regards the full working of this law, but Ican indicate certain most interesting ideas and correspondences; these willfoster in you constructive speculative thinking, yet at the same time theyembody proven facts for those of us who are initiated disciples of the Christ orof Sanat Kumara.LAW XHearken, O Disciple, to the call which comes from the Son to the Mother, andthen obey. The Word goes forth that form has served its purpose. The principleof mind then organises itself and then repeats the Word: The waiting formresponds and drops away. The soul stands free.Respond, O Rising One, to the call which comes within the sphere of obligation;recognise the call, emerging from the Ashram or from the Council Chamber wherewaits the Lord of Life Himself. The Sound goes forth. Both soul and formtogether must renounce the principle of life, and thus permit the Monad to standfree. The soul responds. The form then shatters the connection. Life is nowliberated, owning the quality of conscious knowledge and the fruit of allexperience. These are the gifts of soul and form combined.[679] This Law X is the forerunner of many new laws concerning the relation ofsoul to form or of spirit to matter; this one is given first for two reasons:1. It can be applied by disciples and thus proven to be true to the mass of men,and above all, to the scientific world.2. In the mass of testimony and in the type of death (called at this stage“transference”) the fact of the Hierarchy and of Shamballa can be established.There are three sources of the abstraction which we call “death” if we excludeaccident (which may be incident to other people’s karma), war (which involvesplanetary karma) and natural catastrophes (which are connected entirely with thebody of manifestation of the One in Whom we live and move and have our being).I might pause here at this thought and make somewhat clearer to you thedistinction between this “unknown God,” who expresses himself through the planetas a whole, and Sanat Kumara in His high place at Shamballa. Sanat Kumara is inHimself the essential Identity, responsible for the manifested worlds, but sogreat is His command of energies and forces—owing to His cosmic unfoldment—thatHe requires the entire planet through which to express all that He is. Havingthe full consciousness of the cosmic astral plane and of the cosmic mentalplane, He can apply energies and forces—under cosmic law—which create, sustainand utilise, for the ends of His divine Purpose, the entire planet. He animatesthe planet with His life; He sustains the planet and all that is in or on itthrough His soul quality, which He imparts in varying measure to every form; Hecreates continuously the new forms needed to express the “life more abundantly”and the “increasing purpose of His will” which the progress of the ages makes[680] cyclically possible. We live at this time in a cycle wherein His intenseactivity is utilising the technique of divine destruction for the release of thespiritual life, and He is simultaneously creating the new structure ofcivilisation which will express more fully the evolutionary attainment of theplanet and the kingdoms in nature, leading eventually to the perfect expressionof His divine life and purpose.It would perhaps be wise if we took this tenth Law somewhat in detail, wherepossible, so as to arrive at the synthesis which it is intended to convey: wewill thus gain some realisation that death itself is a part of the creativeprocess of synthesising. It is essential that new ideas and a new approach tothe entire problem of dying are inaugurated.Hearken, O Disciple, to the call which comes from the Son to the Mother, andthen obey.Even whilst we realise from the context that this refers to the discarding ofthe physical body, it is useful to remember that this form of wording cansignify much more than that. It can be interpreted to mean the entire relationof soul and personality, and to involve the prompt obedience of the Mother (thepersonality) to the Son (the soul). Without his prompt obedience, involving asit does the recognition of the informing Voice, the personality will remain deafto the call of the soul to relinquish the body. No habitual response has beendeveloped. I would ask you to ponder on the implications.I am, I know, recapitulating when I point out that the Mother aspect is thematerial aspect and the soul—on its own plane—is the Son. This injunction,therefore, concerns the relation of matter and soul, and thus lays thefoundation for all the relationships which the disciple has to learn torecognise. Obedience is not here enforced; [681 ] it is contingent uponhearing; then obedience follows as the next development. This is an easierprocess, little as you may think it. This distinction, relative to the processof obedience, is interesting because the process of learning by hearing isalways slow and is one of the qualities or aspects of the stage of orientation.Learning by sight is definitely connected with the Path of Discipleship, and anywho wish to become wise and true workers must learn to distinguish between thehearers and those who see. A realisation of the difference would lead to basicchanges in technique. In the one case, you are working with those who aredefinitely under the influence and control of the Mother, and who need to betrained to see. In the other, you are dealing with those who have heard and whoare developing the spiritual correspondence of sight. They are thereforesusceptible to the vision.The Word goes forth that form has served its purpose .This word, or this “spiritual proclamation” of the soul, may have a twofoldpurpose: it may produce death, or it may simply result in a withdrawal of thesoul from its instrument, the threefold personality. This might consequentlyresult in leaving the form uninformed and without any dweller in the body. Whenthis happens the personality (and by this I mean the physical, astral and mentalman) will continue to function. If it is of a high grade quality, very fewpeople will realise that the soul is absent. This frequently happens in old ageor serious illness, and it may persist for years. It sometimes happens whereinfants are concerned, and you then have either death or imbecility, as therehas been no time to train the lower personality vehicles. A little thinkingalong the lines of this “forthgoing Word” will throw much light on circumstanceswhich are [682] regarded as baffling, and on states of consciousness which havehitherto constituted almost insoluble problems.The principle of mind then organises itself and then repeats the Word. Thewaiting form responds and drops away.In the aspect of death here dealt with it is the mind which acts as the agent ofauthority, transmitting to the brain (where the thread of consciousness islocated) the instructions to vacate. This is then passed on by the man in thebody to the heart (where the life thread is anchored), and then—as you wellknow—the process of withdrawal begins. What transpires in those timeless momentsprior to death no one as yet knows, for no one has returned to tell us. If theyhad done so, the question is: Would they have been believed? The probability isthat they would not.The first paragraph of this Law X deals with the passing out from the body(meaning the form aspect of the threefold lower man) of the average intelligentaspirant, looking at this law from one of its lowest correspondences; however,under the same Law of Correspondences, the death of all men, from the lowesttype of man up to and inclusive of the aspirant, is basically distinguished bythe same identical process; the difference exists in the degree of consciousnessevidenced—consciousness of process and intention. The result is the same in allcases:The soul stands free.This moment of true freedom can be brief and fleeting as in the case of theundeveloped man, or it can be of long duration, according to the usefulness ofthe aspirant upon the inner planes; with this I have earlier dealt and have noneed to repeat myself here. Progressively, as the urges and influences of thethree lower levels of consciousness [683] weaken their hold, the period ofdissociation becomes longer and longer, and is characterised by a developingclarity of thought and by a recognition of essential being, and this inprogressive stages. This clarity and progress may not be brought through intofull realisation or expression when rebirth again takes place, for thelimitations imposed by the dense physical body are excessive; nevertheless, eachlife sees a steady growth in sensitivity, and also the storing up of esotericinformation, using the word “esoteric” to signify all that does not concernnormal form life or the average consciousness of man in the three worlds.Esoteric living (as it develops) falls into three stages, broadly speaking;these are carried forward within the consciousness of the man and parallel therecognition and ordinary aspects of form life on the three levels of experience:1. The stage of reception of concepts, of ideas and of principles, thusgradually asserting the existence of the abstract mind.2. The stage of “light reception,” or that period when spiritual insight isdeveloped, when the vision is seen and accepted as true, and when the intuitionor “buddhic perception” is unfolded. This carries with it the assertion as tothe existence of the Hierarchy.3. The stage of abstraction, or the period wherein complete orientation isbrought about, the way into the Ashram is made clear, and the disciple begins tobuild the antahkarana between the personality and the Spiritual Triad. It is inthis stage that the nature of the will is dimly seen, carrying with itsrecognition the implication that there is a “centre where the will of God isknown.”[684] Students are apt to think that death ends things, whereas from the angleof termination we are dealing with values which are persistent, with which thereis no interference, nor can there be any, and which hold within themselves theseeds of immortality. I would have you ponder on this and know that everythingthat is of true spiritual value is persistent, ageless, immortal and eternal.Only that dies which is valueless, and—from the standpoint of humanity—thatmeans those factors which emphasise and assume importance where the form isconcerned. But those values which are based on principle and not upon the detailof appearance have in them that undying principle which leads a man from the“gates of nativity, through the gates of perception, to the gates of purpose”—asthe Old Commentary expresses it.I have endeavoured to show you how the first part of this Law X has a simpleapplication to mankind, as well as an abstract and abstruse meaning foresotericists.The last paragraph in this Law X cannot be interpreted in this same manner norapplied in this way; it concerns only the “passing over” or the “discarding ofhindrances” by very advanced disciples and initiates. This is made clear by theuse of the words, “O Rising One”—a term applied only to those who have taken thefourth initiation and who are therefore held by no aspect whatsoever of the formnature, even so high or transcendental a form as the soul in its own vehicle,the causal body or the egoic lotus. Yet again, facility in response to this lawmust be and is developed in the earlier stages of discipleship, where listening,responsiveness and occult obedience are developed and have their extensions inthe higher levels of spiritual experience.Here we must again consider words and phrases if we are to understand their truemeaning. [685]Respond, O Rising One, to the call which comes within the sphere of obligation.What is this sphere of obligation to which the initiate of high standing mustpay attention? The whole of life experience, from the sphere of nativity up tothe highest limits of spiritual possibility, are covered by four words,applicable at various stages of evolution. They are: Instinct, Duty, Dharma,Obligation; an understanding of the differences serves to bring illumination,and consequently, right action.1. The sphere of instinct . This refers to the fulfillment, under the influenceof simple animal instinct, of the obligations which any assumed responsibilitybrings, even when assumed with no true understanding. An illustration of this isthe instinctual care of a mother for her offspring or the relation of male andfemale. With this we need not deal in any detail, as it is well recognised andunderstood, at least by those who have passed out of the sphere of elementaryinstinctual obligations. To them no particular calls come, but this instinctualworld of give and take is superseded by a higher sphere of responsibilityeventually.2. The sphere of duty. The call that comes from this sphere comes from a realmof consciousness which is more strictly human and not so predominantly animal asis the instinctual realm. It sweeps into its field of activity all classes ofhuman beings and demands from them—life after life—the strict fulfillment ofduty. The “doing of one’s duty,” for which one gets small praise and littleappreciation, is the first step towards the unfoldment of that divine principlewhich we call the sense of responsibility, and which—when unfolded—indicates asteadily growing soul control. The fulfillment [686] of duty, the sense ofresponsibility, and the desire to serve are three aspects of one and the samething: discipleship in its embryonic stage. This is a hard saying for those whoare caught in the seemingly hopeless toils of duty fulfillment; it is hard forthem to realise that this duty which seems to keep them chained to the humdrum,apparently meaningless and thankless duties of daily life, is a scientificprocess leading them to higher phases of experience, and eventually into theMaster’s Ashram.3. The sphere of dharma . This is the outcome of the two previous stages; it isthat in which the disciple recognises, for the first time with clarity, his partin the whole process of world events and his inescapable share in worlddevelopment. Dharma is that aspect of karma which dignifies any particular worldcycle and the lives of those implicated in its working out. The disciple beginsto see that if he shoulders his phase or part in this cyclic dharma and worksunderstandingly at its right fulfillment, he is beginning to comprehend groupwork (as the Masters comprehend it) and to do his just share in lifting theworld karma, working out in cyclic dharma. Instinctual service, the fulfillmentof all duty, and a sharing in group dharma are all blended in his consciousnessand become one great act of living faithful service; he is then at the point ofmoving forward upon the Path of Discipleship, in which the Path of Probation iscompletely lost to sight.These three aspects of living activity are the embryonic expression in the lifeof the disciple of the three divine aspects:a. Instinctual living . . . . intelligent application.b. Duty . . . . . . . . . . . . . .responsible love. [687]c. Dharma . . . . . . . . . . . will, expressed through the Plan.4. The sphere of obligation . The initiate, having learnt the nature of thethree other spheres of right action, and—through the activity of thosespheres—having unfolded the divine aspects, passes now into the sphere ofobligation. This sphere, which can be entered only after a large measure ofliberation has been achieved, directs the reactions of the initiate in twophases of his life:a. In the Ashram, where he is governed by the Plan; this Plan is recognised byhim as expressing his major obligation to life. I use the word “life” in itsdeepest esoteric sense.b. In Shamballa, where the emerging Purpose of Sanat Kumara (of which the Planis an interpretation in time and space) begins to have meaning and significanceaccording to his point in evolution and his approach to the Way of the HigherEvolution.In the Ashram, the life of the Spiritual Triad gradually supersedes the life ofthe soul-controlled personality. In the Council Chamber at Shamballa, the lifeof the Monad supersedes all other expressions of the essential Reality. More Imay not say.Recognise the call, emerging from the Ashram or from the Council Chamber wherewaits the Lord of Life Himself.Here again we come up against the whole underlying, evolutionary theme ofInvocation and Evocation. Here, it is the two higher centres of the divineExistence which are invoking ceaselessly the lower centre; one of the factorsgoverning the whole creative process is dependent upon the [688] skill of theGreat Lives in evoking response from the human and subhuman kingdoms or groupedlives within the three worlds of form life. Men are so pre-occupied with theirown problems that they are apt to think that—in the long run—what happens isentirely due to their behaviour, conduct, and invocative powers. There is,however, another side to the picture; this involves the skill in action, theunderstanding hearts and the clear unimpeded will of both the Hierarchy andShamballa.It will be apparent to you, therefore, how essential it is that all disciplesand initiates should know exactly where they stand on the Path, the final aspectof the ladder of evolution; otherwise, they will misinterpret the call and failto recognise the source of the outgoing sound. How easily this can happenbecomes apparent to every advanced teacher of occultism and esotericism when heperceives how easily unimportant people and beginners interpret calls andmessages they hear or receive as coming to them from some high and elevatedsource, whereas they are in all probability hearing that which emanates fromtheir own subconscious, from their own souls, or from some teacher (not aMaster) who is attempting to help them.The call referred to here, however, comes from the highest possible sources andmust not be confused with the little voices of little men.The SOUND goes forth .It is not my intention here to deal with the creative sound, beyond calling toyour attention the fact that it is creative. The Sound which was the firstindication of the activity of the planetary Logos is not a word, but a fullreverberating sound, holding within itself all other sounds, all chords andcertain musical tones (which have been given the name of the “music of thespheres”) and dissonances, [689] unknown as yet to the modern ear. It is thisSound which the “Rising One” must learn to recognise, and to which he mustrespond not only by means of the sense of hearing and its highercorrespondences, but through a response from every part and aspect of the formnature in the three worlds. I would remind you also that from the angle of thefourth initiation even the egoic vehicle, the soul body, is regarded and treatedas a part of the form nature.Though the “shattering of the Temple of Solomon” takes place at the time of thefourth initiation, those qualities of which it was composed have been absorbedinto the vehicles which the initiate is using for all His contacts in the threeworlds. He is now essentially the essence of all His bodies, and—from His pointof view and technical understanding—it must be borne in mind that the entiremental plane is one of the three planes which constitute the cosmic densephysical plane; this is a point oft forgotten by students, who almost invariablyplace the soul body and the mental permanent atom outside the form limits andwhat they call the three worlds. Technically and from higher angles, this is notso, and this fact definitely changes and conditions the thinking and work of theinitiate of the fourth and higher degrees. It accounts also for the need for theegoic body to disappear.The Sound reverberates throughout the four higher subplanes of the cosmicphysical plane; these are the higher correspondence of the four etheric levelsof the physical plane in the three worlds—the three dense physical and the fouretheric planes. It must be remembered, therefore, that our planes, with which weare so familiar, are the cosmic physical, and that the one we know the best isthe densest of the seven—hence so much of our struggle and difficulty.[690] From “the silence which is sound, the reverberating note of Shamballa,”the sound focusses itself either in the Spiritual Triad or in the Ashram,according to the status of the initiate and whether he is high in the ashramiccircles, or still higher, in the circles through which radiates the light fromthe Council Chamber. In the first case, it will be the heart centre whichresponds to the sound, and from thence the whole body; in the second case,consciousness has been superseded by a still higher type of spiritualrecognition, to which we have given the inadequate name of identification. Wherethe sound has been registered in the heart of the initiate, he has unfolded allpossible types of knowledge which the form nature—soul and body—can makepossible; when the registration is in the head, identification has produced suchcomplete unity with all spiritual expressions of life, the word “more” (meaningincreased) must perforce give way to the word “deep,” in the sense ofpenetration. Having said this, brother of mine, how much have you comprehended?It is at this point that the initiate is confronted for the first time with theSeven Paths, because each Path constitutes a mode of penetrating into realms ofrealisation beyond our planet altogether.In order to do this, the initiate has to demonstrate his mastery of the Law ofDifferentiation and arrive at a knowledge of the Seven Paths throughdifferentiating the seven sounds which make up the one Sound, but which are notrelated to the seven sounds which compose the threefold AUM.Both soul and form together must renounce the principle of life, and thus permitthe Monad to stand free. The soul responds. The form then shatters theconnection.[691] You can see here why I emphasised the fact that the initiate is therecipient of the essential quality or qualities which form has revealed anddeveloped, and which the soul has absorbed. At this particular crisis, theinitiate within the Ashram or “on His way of glory to the Place where dwells theLord” (Shamballa) summarises or contains within himself all the essential goodwhich was stored in the soul prior to its destruction at the fourth initiation.He epitomises in himself the knowledge and the wisdom of aeons of struggle andof patient endurance. Nothing further is to be gained by adhering either to thesoul or to the form. He has taken all they had to give which throws light on thespiritual Law of Sacrifice. It is interesting to note how the soul becomes atthis point simply the intermediary between the personality and the initiate ofhigh degree. But now there is nothing more to relate, to report or to transmit,and—as the Sound reverberates—the soul disappears, as testimony of response. Itis now but an empty shell, but its substance is of so high an order that itbecomes an integral part of the buddhic level, and its function there isetheric. The principle of life is renounced and returns to the reservoir ofuniversal life.I would have you take notice of the importance of form activity. It is the Formwhich shatters the connection (the usually despised, belittled, frustrated formis that which performs the final act), bringing complete liberation. The “LunarLord” of the personality has achieved his goal, and those elements which havecomposed his three vehicles (physical, astral, mental), together with the lifeprinciple, will constitute the atomic substance of the first body ofmanifestation of some soul seeking incarnation for the first time. This isclosely related to the abstruse subject of the permanent atoms. It marks amoment of high initiation for this Lunar Lord when he shatters the connection[692] and severs all relation with the hitherto informing soul. He is no longerjust a shadow, but has now those qualities which make him “substantial” (in theesoteric sense) and a new factor in time and space.The remaining words of this law need no explanation and mark a fitting finishfor this section of our studies:Life is now liberated, owning the qualities of conscious knowledge and the fruitof all experience. These are the gifts of soul and form combined."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX - THE SEVEN MODES OF HEALING[693] It will be obvious to that even if the techniques or the seven modes ofhealing—relating as they do to the energies of the seven rays—were exactlyimparted to you, it would be rare indeed to find a healer who was competent touse them in this interim period in world affairs. We are passing out of one ageinto another, and this necessarily creates difficulties which have hitherto notbeen recognised. This is the first time in human history wherein humanity isintelligent enough to register understanding of the implications of thishappening, and far-sighted enough to be able to vision, imagine and plan for thenew future. For another thing, the soul ray of the average aspirant is seldom incontrol to such an extent that it can bring adequate illumination and raypotency; until it is in control, these ray methods and techniques, determiningthe use and direction of the ray energies, are useless. This should not bring toyou disappointment, but simply an attitude of expectancy, particularly where theyounger students and readers are concerned. All things considered, this hiatusbetween expectancy and possibility is exceedingly good.There has been so much given out during the past century along the lines ofmagical work, that more at this time would not be wise; so many mantrams andWords of Power have been communicated, and so wide a use of the [694] OM hasprevailed, that a great deal of damage might be looked for as a result. Suchdamage has not, however, occurred. The relatively low point in evolution of theaverage student and experimenter has served as a protection, and little has beenset in motion—either good or bad—by what they have attempted to do. Healingshave frequently taken place (at least temporary healings), owing largely to thesusceptibility of the patient to suggestion and his confidence in the healer.None of these healings can be traced esoterically to the scientific methods ofoccultism. In spite of this protection, or rather because of it, I amcommunicating no Ray Words at this time, such as the trained initiate employswhen engaged in the healing work. These Words have to he accompanied by atrained use of the spiritual will, and (where the ordinary man and healer isconcerned) even the lowest aspect of the will remains as yet undeveloped, andonly self-will (which is determined, selfish desire) is expressed. It wouldtherefore be a waste of my time to give instruction along these lines. I have felt it necessary to explain this, so that there will be no undueexpectancy that I shall impart the mysterious and the hitherto unknown. I seekonly to lay the foundation for a future structure of knowledge, when it will besafe, wise and right to convey those “focussing Points,” those “organisingWords,” and those “expressed Intentions” of the correctly trained occult healer.I seek to generate in you also a wise and searching expectancy which will usethe little that I am able to impart, and the symbolic words I may dictate, andso prepare for a greater understanding later.In the meantime there are certain things I can teach you which will beprofitable. They may perchance enhance the visioned and realised difficulties,but may nevertheless prove useful in indicating the ground which must still be[695] covered before the healer arrives at correct and sustained healing.This section will be very short indeed, compared with the rest of this volume;it will consist simply of a series of summarised and condensed statements whichwill provide a textbook for the healer, a reference book for guidance to whichhe can refer. These statements will be under three classifications:I. The Seven Ray Energies.II. The Rays of the Healer and the Patient.III. The Seven Healing Techniques.These statements will complete Volume IV of A Treatise on the Seven Rays andwill carry much information to the initiated disciple, and even in part to theintelligent aspirant; they should make their healing work more effectual, eventhough only the preliminary work and elementary rules are given. Needless toadd, the healer has to perfect himself in this initial activity and—as heworks—he may himself (alone and unaided) penetrate into the deeper meanings ofthis phase of the Ageless Wisdom.THE SEVEN RAY ENERGIESFifteen Statements.1. The seven rays embody and express the totality of energies which circulatethroughout our planetary form.2. These seven ray energies are the seven forces which unitedly compose theprimary Ray of Love-Wisdom. This is the second ray of our solar system and thedominating ray in every planetary expression within the solar system. The sevenrays are, all of them, subsidiary rays of this great cosmic ray. [696]3. No matter upon which ray the healer may be found, he must always work throughthe second subray of that ray—the ray of love-wisdom in each ray. By means ofthis, he becomes connected with or related to the governing soul and personalityrays. The second ray has the capacity of all-inclusiveness.4. The second ray and the second subray on all rays are themselves dual inexpression. The healer must learn to work through the love aspect and notthrough the wisdom aspect. This takes much training in the practice of spiritualdifferentiation.5. Those vehicles in the form nature which are on the line of 2-4-6 must be usedby the healer when practicing the healing art. If he has no vehicles or bodieson this line of basic energy, he will not be able to heal. This is seldomrealised. It is rare, however, to find an equipment lacking all second rayenergy outlets.6. Those healers who are on the second ray, or who are equipped with a powerfulsecond ray vehicle, are usually great healers. The Christ, being the truestexponent of the second ray ever known on earth, was greatest of all the healingsons of God.7. The ray of the soul conditions and determines the technique to be employed.The ray in the personality vehicles most closely related to the second ray (forwhich all the subrays act as channels) is the one through which the healingenergy must flow.8. The second subray of the soul ray determines the approach to the healingproblem immediately confronting the healer; this energy is transmuted intohealing force when passing through the appropriate personality vehicle. To beappropriate it must be on the line of 2-4-6. [697]9. The appropriate vehicle can be either the mental body or the emotional body.With the mass of men being centred in the astral nature, the healing willusually be most successful if the healer’s channel of transmission is that bodyalso.10. A triangle of energies is therefore formed; it is composed of:a. The energy of the soul.b. The appropriate vehicle.c. The etheric body, through either the heart or the solar plexus centre.11. Within the etheric body, a secondary triangle is formed for the circulationof energy between:a. The head centre, the centre of reception.b. The ajna centre, the centre for directed distribution.c. The centre which registers—as the line of least resistance—the energy of thesoul ray, whichever of the seven rays that may be.12. This secondary triangle is related to the primary triangle by an “act ofdeliberation.” This is a part of the technique which I am withholding.13. The healer who is sincere and experienced can (in default of the esotericformula producing connection between the two triangles) do much to bring aboutsome definite relation by a deliberate act of faith and by the firm statement ofhis fixed intention.14. The greater triangle is that which affects the healer and makes him atransmitting agent; the lesser triangle is the one which produces the effectupon the patient and through which the healer—on the physical plane—works.15. The procedure of the healer will therefore fall into three parts, prior tothe conscious act of healing: [698]Process One .a. The healer will definitely and consciously link up with his own soul.b. He will then determine which of his personality vehicles is to be used; thiswill be based upon its reaction to energies, channeling along the line 2-4-6.c. By an act of the will he will then relate the soul energy, via the desiredvehicle, with the appropriate centre in the etheric body; the heart or the solarplexus, always preferably the former.Process two.a. He will next create the secondary triangle by focussing his attention in thecentre of reception, the head centre.b. He will then connect this head centre, through the power of the creativeimagination, with the centre between the eyebrows, and will hold the energythere because it is the directing agency.c. He will endeavour to gather into this ajna centre the energy of that centrewithin his etheric body which is related to his soul ray.Process Three.He then, with deliberation, performs the act of linking the two triangles; oncethis is done, he is ready for the healing action.THE RAYS OF HEALER AND OF PATIENT.It will be apparent to the most superficial reader that the variation or theidentity between the rays of the healer [699] and his patient constitutes afactor of importance: many conditioning factors will be presented; there willalso be present a contrast between the soul rays and the personality rays ofboth parties concerned. You may have, therefore, conditions in which:1. The soul rays are identical and the personality rays are different.2. The personality rays are the same but the soul rays are not.3. The rays are similar in both cases.4. The rays of neither soul nor personality are the same.5. The soul ray is not known but the personality ray is apparent. The ray of thepersonality is easily ascertained, but there is often no indication as to thesoul ray. This can apply to both healer and patient.6. Nothing is known anent the rays of either party.I am not bringing into this discussion any reference to the rays of the mental,astral or physical vehicles, though they have a definite and sometimes adecisive effect and the knowledge is most useful when known. The trained healer,when in possession of this knowledge, can use a secondary technique as an aid tothe basic method, and use the appropriate lower vehicle (either his own or thatof the patient) through which to pour a secondary stream of healing energy, thusenhancing the work of the primary stream. The addition of this secondary streamimplies quite advanced knowledge on the part of the healer, or accurateinformation given by the patient. This is, as you may surmise, somewhat rare tofind. People can, by careful study and the assembling of known analogousinstances, ascertain with a fair degree of success the nature of the two major[700] rays; it takes, however, an initiate of some standing to recognise andwork through the rays of one of the lower bodies, and therefore be in a positionto distribute the healing force through two centres simultaneously. We will notconsequently consider more than the relation of the rays controlling the healerand the patient from the angle of soul and personality.It is not possible for me to take each of the rays of both healer and patientand trace for you the appropriate technique; this will become clearer if youconsider the great number of difficulties which are presented when both the raysof the two parties concerned are brought into relationship. In Discipleship inthe New Age the rays are given of a large number of disciples. You might, as anexperimental exercise, take these various rays, as assigned, and place each ofthese disciples in the part of either healer or patient, and see what centreswould be employed in the case of some disease (each based in a differentlocation in the human body), and then attempt to decide what method, mode orprocedure the healer would be wise to follow. At the same time you shouldremember two things: first, that all these people are members of a second rayAshram; also that they are disciples, and consequently their rays are apparentand obvious to the healer, which greatly helps. You could determine also whatray energy should be employed in the healing process, through what centre inyourself, as the healer, and the disciple as a patient, you should work andwhether you are in a position to use a secondary technique. Then, having throughthe use of the imagination worked at an imaginary healing, look around amongyour friends and acquaintances for those whom you believe possess similar rayconditions and—if they are ailing or ill—seek to help them in the same way asyou attempted to aid an imaginary patient: note then what happens. Avoid the use[701] of a secondary technique, for you are more liable to be entirely wrongwhere the three lower vehicles are involved than with the two major expressionsof life. The rest of this subject can perhaps be clarified by certain statements whichwill become clearer as esoteric psychology emerges as a definite educationalsubject in the decades which lie ahead.1. The healer should ascertain his rays, and then proceed with his work on thebasis of that information. When that knowledge is not available, he shouldrefrain from the attempt to heal.2. When unable—from lack of this knowledge—to carry forward the healing work,let him confine himself to the task of acting as a channel for the energy oflove to the patient.3. The healer will find it easier in most cases to ascertain his rays, or one ofthem at least, than to know the rays of the patient.There are two reasons for this:a. The fact that he seeks to heal and help indicates a fair measure ofadvancement upon the spiritual way. Such advancement is required for correctfinding of the ray quality. A little study of himself and of the possible rayspresent should in time show him the nature of the energies controlling him.b. The patient, if advanced, is liable not to seek his help, but will handle hisown problem, through the soul and through the Ashram, if affiliated with one. Ifhe is not advanced, the personality ray will be more easily ascertained than thesoul ray, and will therefore provide the point of contact.[702] 4. The healer, having to his satisfaction determined upon the rays or rayconditioning him, should then prepare himself for the healing task by a minimumof five hours of most careful preparation, related to his mind, the thinkingapparatus. I mean not five hours of consecutive mental control and reflection,but a period of quiet thought, carried on—when possible—wherein the healerstudies the patient and familiarises himself with:a. The problem of the disease and its particular nature.b. Its location in the physical body.c. The centre involved and (when he is an enlightened disciple) with itscondition.d. The acuteness of the difficulty and the chance of a cure.e. The danger of death or not.f. The psychological condition of the patient.g. The rays of the patient, if feasible; these, if known, will condition hisapproach.5. Thus prepared, the healer focusses his attention in his own ray. When he onlypossesses general and not specific knowledge of his own ray or rays and those ofthe patient, the healer may proceed upon the surmise that one or both are alongthe line of 1-3-5-7 or 2-4-6 and act upon that general assumption. To possessspecific and particularised knowledge is useful, but where it exists not, andparticular rays cannot be assigned, it is often possible to determine whetherthe general trend of the character is along the line of love or of the will, andthen to act accordingly. The problem then is whether the relation between healerand [703] patient will be from personality to personality, from soul to soul, orfrom personality to soul and vice versa. When the relation is that ofpersonality to personality (and this will be the most usual), the energy withwhich the healer will work is simply that of planetary prana; the effect of thiswill be to stimulate the natural processes of the physical body and (incooperation with nature and so in line with the patient’s karma) so fortify hisphysical vehicle that he can cast off the disease or can be aided to face withconfidence the processes of death, and with calm and intelligent understandingpass out to the subtler realms of being. Where the relation is that of the soulof the healer to the personality of the patient, the healer will work with rayenergy, pouring his own ray energy through the centre which is controlling thediseased area. When both the soul of the healer and that of the patient areworking in cooperation there can be the blending of two energies or (wheresimilar rays are present) the strengthening of one energy and a greatly hastenedwork of healing or of dissolution. The healer must ever bear in mind that histask is either to heal—under the karmic law—or to aid in the processes ofdissolution, bringing about, therefore, a higher form of healing. Unless thehealer is a higher initiate and can work in full awareness of circumstances andgoverning conditions, sudden healings and dramatically arrested disease will notoccur. If they do occur, it will be due to three things:a. The destiny of the patient whose time has not yet come.b. The interposition of the patient’s own soul, who is, in the last analysis,the agent of karma. [704]c. The aid of the healer which proved adequate enough to give the patient thenecessary confidence and added strength to bring about his own healing.10. Nobody is ever brought back from the “gates of death” whose karma indicatesthat his time has come; the life cycle on the physical plane then ends unless heis a worker in an Ashram, a disciple of some standing whose work and presence isstill needed on earth to complete his assigned task. Then the Master of theAshram may add His knowledge and energy to that of the healer or to that of thepatient, and bring about a temporary postponement of departure. Upon this thehealer may not count, or the patient either, for they know not the full andwarranting circumstances.11. There are certain elementary requirements or conditions in which the healershould work and which are necessary. These are:a. Complete quiet in the sickroom, as far as possible.b. As few people in the patient’s room as wisdom may dictate. The thinking andthoughtforms of the people present can either be distracting or distracted, andthereby deflect the healing currents; on the other hand, they can sometimesstrongly aid the healer’s work.c. The patient—again when possible—should lie on his back, or on his side sothat centres up the spine are turned towards the healer. In some cases (andthese the healer must himself determine) he should lie in such a position thatthe healer can hold his hands above the area of disease, though in no case mustthe healer touch the patient’s body.12. When quiet, peace and silence have been reached, the healer will proceedwith the appropriate technique. The [705] quiet, peace and silence mentionedabove refer not only to physical conditions, but to the emotional and mentalstates of the healer and the patient as well as of those present; this is notalways easy to attain.Where the healer has not the appropriate technique or does not understand theformulas given later in this instruction, he can assemble his own technique andrules after a close study of these healing instructions, which contain enoughmaterial and suggestions for such an action.THE SEVEN HEALING TECHNIQUESThe techniques I shall have to give in the form of seven ancient symbolicstatements or formulas, gathered out of the Book of Rules for InitiatedDisciples. I dare not yet give the simple physical application of these raytechniques, as it would be too dangerous. When rightly used and understood theycarry terrific force and—in the wrong hands—could work real damage. May I remindyou here that the Black Lodge initiates likewise heal or produce death anddisease, and employ very similar techniques; the difference lies in the factthat they can work only with the personality rays of both healer and patient,and because they are more potent on the physical plane than are the Members ofthe Great White Lodge, their work is frequently most effective. The spiritualhealer, working with the energies of light whenever possible, is seldom aseffective physically.The members of the Black Lodge, or healers working under its influence, are,however, totally unable to work on a patient who is spiritually oriented to theslightest degree, and is therefore coming under the control of the soul; neithercan they work through a healer who is spiritually oriented. When they attempt todo so they find themselves combatted by energy coming from the Ashram towards[706] which either the healer or the patient is moving or with which he isaffiliated, even if he has his place only upon the periphery. Where the averageunthinking man is concerned, the danger of “black” interference is nil; the darkforces do not interest themselves in any unimportant person, save with those ofpotency and influence who can serve their ends. Also their evil work is onlypossible at the moment (or cycle) wherein the man is making decision as towhether he will move in spiritual living, remain static where he is, or turnwith deliberation (which is exceedingly rare) to the path of pure selfishness.This path leads to the Black Lodge.Some disciple in the early part of next century will take these techniques ormagical statements, relating to the healing work, and interpret them andelucidate them. They are susceptible of three significances, the lowest of whichthe modern student may succeed in interpreting for himself if he reflectsadequately and lives spiritually. Here are the seven statements.THE SEVEN STATEMENTS1. The first ray technique.Let the dynamic force which rules the hearts of all within Shamballa come to myaid, for I am worthy of that aid. Let it descend unto the third, pass to thefifth and focus on the seventh. These words mean not what doth at sight appear.The third, the fifth, the seventh lie within the first and come from out theCentral Sun of spiritual livingness. The highest then awakens within the one whoknows and within the one who must be healed and thus the two are one. This ismystery deep. The blending of the healing force effects the work desired; it maybring death, [707] that great release, and re-establish thus the fifth, thethird, the first, but not the seventh.This dynamic first ray energy is usually employed by the trained spiritualhealer when it is apparent to him that the patient’s hour has come and releaseapproaches. In cases where the first ray is the soul ray of either healer orpatient, this application of first ray energy must move from head centre to headcentre, and from thence to the area of distress and to the centre allied withthe location. This may cause (when healing is possible and karmically correct) atemporary increase of the trouble; this is owing to the fact that the incomingenergy “expels dynamically” the very seed or roots of the disease. There may bea rise in temperature, or a collapse of some kind or another, and for this thehealer, the patient and the attendant physician must be prepared and should takethe needed physical steps for amelioration—steps as ordained by the orthodoxmedical profession, which will offset the purely physical reaction. Where thesoul ray of the patient is not on the first ray, but the first ray is the ray ofthe personality, the healer must use great caution in applying first ray energy,and should proceed very slowly and gradually through the centre on the line of1-3-5-7 which is nearest to the seat of trouble, passing the energy through thatcentre and thence to the centre (whichever that may be) found in the locality ofthe disease. If that particular centre happens to be on the line of 3-5-7, thehealer will have to exercise special care, or else the dynamic first ray energywill destroy and not heal.2. The second ray technique .Let the healing energy descend, carrying its dual lines of life and its magneticforce. Let that magnetic living force withdraw and supplement that [708] whichis present in the seventh, opposing four and six to three and seven, but dealingnot with five. The circular, inclusive vortex—descending to the point—disturbs,removes and then supplies and thus the work is done.The heart revolves; two hearts revolve as one; the twelve within the vehicle,the twelve within the head and the twelve upon the plane of soul endeavour,cooperate as one and thus the work is done. Two energies achieve thisconsummation and the three whose number is a twelve respond to the greatertwelve. The life is known and the years prolonged.If this ancient statement is read in the light of any knowledge you may have(and you probably have more than you realise), particularly knowledge anent thecentres, the primary or easiest interpretation will appear.3. The third ray technique.The healer stands and weaves. He gathers from the three, the five, the seventhat which is needed for the heart of life. He brings the energies together andmakes them serve the third; he thus creates a vortex into which the onedistressed must descend and with him goes the healer, and yet they both remainin peace and calm. Thus must the angel of the Lord descend into the pool andbring the healing life.The “pool of waters” figures here and may cause much questioning as to itssignificance. Its elementary interpretation relates in reality to the centraland major cause of much disease (as we have earlier seen), the emotional nature,which it is the task of the third aspect of divinity [709] to control. Ponder onthis, for much enlightenment may come.The next healing technique is longer and far more abstruse. There is little ofit that you will understand; it is entirely related, as far as our theme isconcerned, to man himself and to the aphorism: “Man, know thyself.”4. The fourth ray technique.The healer knows the place where dissonance is found. He also knows the power ofsound and the sound which must be heard. Knowing the note to which the fourthgreat group reacts and linking it to the great Creative Nine, he sounds the notewhich brings release, the note which will bring absorption into one. He educatesthe listening ear of him who must be healed; he likewise trains the listeningear of him who must go forth. He knows the manner of the sound which brings thehealing touch; and also that which says: Depart. And thus the work is done.This fourth technique is one that—in default of true ray knowledge—can be ofgeneral usefulness, because this fourth ray governs the fourth kingdom innature, the human. The healer along this line of work (and such healers arepractically nonexistent at this time because the fourth ray is not inincarnation) heals primarily through the use of the appropriate sound or sounds.In the early stages when this technique comes into demonstration, music will belargely used by the healer to bring about a cure or to facilitate the process ofdeath or departure. It will, however, be music with one constantly recurringchord, which will embody the note of the fourth ray and of the human kingdom.Healing by the means of sound will be one of the first healing unfoldments [710]to be noted at the close of the next century. More teaching along this linewould be useless until the fourth ray again cycles into manifestation.5. The fifth ray technique .That which has been given must be used; that which emerges from within the givenmode will find its place within the healer’s plan. That which is hidden must beseen and from the three, great knowledge will emerge. For these the healerseeks. To these the healer adds the two which are as one, and so the fifth mustplay its part and the five must play its part and the five must function as ifone. The energies descend, pass through and disappear, leaving the one who couldrespond with karma yet to dissipate and taking with them him who may not thusrespond and so must likewise disappear.The obvious and simplest meaning of the fifth ray mode of healing is that thehealer, working scientifically and largely on concrete levels, employs all aidsto bring about a cure, starting with appropriate physical care and passing on tosubtler modes of healing. Again I would point out that physical aid can be asdivinely used as the more mysterious methods which the metaphysical healer ofthe present time believes to be so profoundly more effective. Just as all modernknowledge, developed on the physical plane, through the personalities of men andwomen of insight and genius everywhere, is useful to the disciple and initiate,in time and space, so it is with the medical sciences. Just as right applicationof these varying sciences has to be made by the disciple or the initiate inorder to bring about spiritual results, so must it be when the healer is atwork.All work becomes spiritual when rightly motivated, when wise discrimination isemployed and soul power is [711] added to the knowledge gained in the threeworlds. The dynamic use of energy in one of its seven streams, added to the saneunderstanding and work of the modern physician, aided by the healer (who worksas does a catalyst), can produce miracles when destiny so ordains. Themetaphysical healer who works solely on the subtler levels is like the spiritualworker who fails so constantly to precipitate the needed financial assets on thephysical plane. This is caused frequently by a subtle—though usuallyunrecognised—sense of superiority with which the average healer and theesotericist views his problem of materialisation of either physical health ormoney. Ponder on this and realise that fifth ray methods carry through to thephysical plane; there they engender conflict and eventually produce a physicalprecipitation of the desired nature. In what I have said anent the fifth raytechniques, I have given more hints and information than in any of the others.6. The sixth ray technique.Cleaving the waters, let the power descend, the healer cries. He minds not howthe waters may respond; they oft bring stormy waves and dire and dreadfulhappenings. The end is good. The trouble will be ended when the storm subsidesand energy has fulfilled its charted destiny. Straight to the heart the power isforced to penetrate, and into every channel, nadi, nerve and spleen the powermust seek a passage and a way and thus confront the enemy who has electedentrance and settled down to live. Ejection—ruthless, sudden and complete—isundertaken by the one who sees naught else but perfect functioning and brooks nointerference. This perfect functioning opens thus the door to life eternal or tolife on earth for yet a little while.[712] This technique is curiously potent and sudden when the healer is on thesixth ray; the results are drastic and full of pain, but the results aresure—healing or death, and oft the latter. The sixth ray healer is seldomdisciplined or wise at this time, owing to this being the end of the sixth raycycle. When again the sixth ray comes into manifestation, humanity will haveprogressed far along the Path and the present aggressive, too sure, fanaticalsixth ray healer will not re-appear. Today they are the majority, and their workis not good; it is well-intentioned, but the technique is ignorantly applied andthe end justifies not the assurance of the healer, leading to frequent deceptionof the patient.7. The seventh ray technique.Energy and force must meet each other and thus the work is done. Colour andsound in ordered sequence must meet and blend and thus the work of magic canproceed. Substance and spirit must evoke each other and, passing through thecentre of the one who seeks to aid, produce the new and good. The healerenergises thus with life the failing life, driving it forth or anchoring it yetmore deeply in the place of destiny. All seven must be used and through theseven there must pass the energies the need requires, creating the new man whohas for ever been and will for ever be, and either here or there.In this technique you have the clue to them all, for the work of the seventh rayhealer is to bring together the life and the substance which will take the placeof the substance which is diseased and bring new life to aid the recovery. Theglory of life lies in consummation and in emergence. This is the prime task andthe prime reward of all true [713] healers. It is this technique of attractionand substitution which will be brought to a fine point of scientific expressionin the coming new age wherein the seventh ray will dominate our planet,producing that which is new and needed and determining the coming culture,civilisation and science.In conclusion I would like to tell you the reasons I am refraining from moredetailed information and from a clear analysis of the wording of these ancientformulas of healing. Apart from the reason, earlier stated, that men are not yetready to be given explicit instructions, for the time being anything I might saywould appear to you puerile. That is the curious word which seems to bedescriptive of possible immediate reaction. We are on the verge of entering anew era in scientific unfoldment, owing to the discovery of how to release theenergy of the atom. Not even the scientists responsible for the discovery havethe faintest idea of the far-reaching effects of this momentous happening. Fromthe angle of our subject and the theme of this volume, an entirely new languagerelated to energy and force is already in the making: the use of the discoveryin the handling of disease will, in almost the immediate future (from the occultangle) be regarded as little short of miraculous.This discovery of atomic liberation has been brought about by the activity ofthe first ray in relation to the incoming seventh ray and has its analogoussituation in the liberation of the Master at the fifth initiation (when the doorof the tomb bursts wide open) and in the act of dying, when the imprisoned soulfinds release. In the light of future scientific happenings, these ancienttechniques will become much clearer, and in the meantime any explanation oftheir true “energetic import” would be meaningless. The [714] new and comingterminology will throw light on the ancient formulas, and in time you will seehow much can be conveyed to the intelligent healer of that new generation bywhat seems to you both disappointing, without use or significance, andneedlessly abstruse.In this interim period between the past and that which is on its way, it is noteasy for even a Master of the Wisdom to speak or teach, particularly inconnection with the theme of healing. The physical body is not yet generallyrecognised as an electrical unit; its nature as pure atomic energy is not yetrealised; the fact of the energy body, the etheric vehicle, is not at this timerecognised in the teachings of the modern medical schools, though the fact hasbeen discussed; the explosive nature of energy, when in contact with force, orof the soul in relation to substance, is completely unknown or veiled inmystical language. Until such time as the new scientific formulas and the newapproach (which the discovery of the release of atomic energy has made possible)have become more generally understood, are a familiar subject of discussion andcouched in familiar language, the coming science of healing must remain behind aveil of unsuitable language and hidden by inappropriate words.This fact, as I have oft told you, handicaps all new presentations of truth; thelanguage of the electrical engineer or of the automobile draftsman, forinstance, would have been entirely meaningless to the average man a hundredyears ago. So it is with the new themes and the great discoveries which are ontheir way and which will eventually affect every department of human life,including the Art of Healing.I sign myself, because it has been given out who I am, as the Master Djwhal Khul.THE TIBETANRELECTION OF THE SPIRITUAL TRIAD IN THE PERSONALITY[Image00018.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"THE ARCANE SCHOOLTraining for new age discipleshipis provided by the Arcane School.The principles of the Ageless Wisdomare presented through esoteric meditation,study and service as a way of life.Contact the publishers for information."},{"pageContent":"INDEXAAbdomencancer, cause, 240diseases, cause, 108Abrams method, contribution and limitation, 279-280Absence of mind, 342Absorption, definition, 434Abstractiondeveloped from detachment, 674final, three points of departure, 472-473of its own intrinsic energy by soul, 470of life principle, 444-445plane of, 419-420stage, 683will principle of, 448Acceptance of life, positive, results, 92Acidity, causes, 38-39Act of Restitution, 460-464Adrenals, relations, 45Affirmations, futility, 193, 212After-deathconsciousness.
