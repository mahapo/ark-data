It is a pity that this is so. The worshippers are asbad as the distrusters. Neither advance us toward a fair appraisal of that largebody of Eastern thinking which is so curiously different from our own and yet,as one discovers after a while, is so fundamentally the same in its essentialquest.It is this undiscriminating attitude which is no doubt to blame for thewell-nigh entire omission of Eastern thought from our philosophical andpsychological books—this, and another thing. The East has its own idioms whichare difficult for the West to understand. Untranslated, they make Easternwriting seem a strange jargon either of confused poetizing or ofself-mystification.Mrs. Bailey, in this book, has done the great service of bringing a criticalmind to bear upon Eastern thought, a mind ready to recognize that Eastern,precisely like Western thought, can lay no claim to a finality of wisdom. Shedoes not come with awe-inspiring garb and gesture, bidding the Westernerrelinquish his crude inadequacies to embrace a mysterious doctrine all the morewonderful because, to him, it may seem absurd. She says, in effect: “ThisEastern thought [10] has the significance of a research into the deeper problemsof existence. It is not necessarily better than the Western. It is different. Itstarts from another angle of approach. Both East and West have specialized intheir thinking. Each, therefore, has the virtue of its own sincerity and its ownpeculiar penetration. But specialization has its value only as it leads to anultimate integration. Is not the time ripe for bringing East and West togetherin this profoundest region of the life of each of them, the region, namely, oftheir philosophical and psychological thinking?”If for no other reason, this book is significant as an attempt, not only tointerpret East to West and West to East, but to bring the two trains of thinkinginto the harmony of a single point of view. Whether she has successfullyachieved the integration remains for the reader to decide. But the attempt is anotable one and should bear fruit in a more intelligent approach to both typesof thought.What gives this book its especial significance, however, is the uniquecomparison which the author makes between the Western study of the glands andthe Eastern study of the “centers.” The Western philosopher, Spinoza, long agonoted the indisseverable parallelism of what he called body and mind in the lifeof the Absolute and in the life of those expressions of the Absolute that wecall individuals. If such a parallelism exists, one will expect to find, forevery outer manifestation, the inner, or psychic force that thus manifests [11]itself. Hitherto we have taken that assumption of inner and outer only in themost general way. This book, by centering, in the main, on the study of theglands, that are the pace-makers, so to speak, of our personality, presents thebody-mind relation not only in a way unexpectedly rich in suggestion for a moreadequate training of the individual, but in a way that opens up fascinatingpossibilities of further research. In the West, we speak of the thyroid or theadrenals altogether in terms of their physiological behaviour. Is there likewisea psychic counterpart of this behaviour? It seems a queer question to ask andone that at first blush would be scoffed at by the physiological scientists. Andyet, unless we are hardened dogmatists who have not yet emerged from thedarkness of nineteenth century materialism, we do speak of the psychiccounterpart of that physiological organ we call the brain. Why not, then, thepsychic counterparts of the thyroid, adrenals, and the rest?If we pursue this question to its logical end, we shall doubtless learn toextend our thought of what the psychic life of the individual is far beyond therather naive intellectualistic point which regards that life as centering solelyin the brain.I am holding no brief for the tentative conclusions reached by the author of thebook. The particular conclusions may need modification or even rejection. Butthat the author has opened up new possibilities which may eventually lead tophysiological and psychological research that will be of [12] profoundsignificance I have no doubt whatever. The book is not only challenging butsingularly illuminating. It will come as a surprise to the Western mind, butwith the surprise will, I think, be mingled a very real admiration for processesof Eastern thinking with which we, in the West, are altogether too unfamiliar.H.A. Overstreet,New York City, May 1930"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I — INTRODUCTION[13] Three desires prompt the writing of this book: the desire to bring togetherthe materialistic or external psychology and the introspective or internalpsychology, and, secondly, looking past scientific psychology to the largerrealm of race thought and race psychology, the desire to harmonise thematerialistic West and the introspective East, and finally to show that allthese conflicting aspects are but facets of the one truth and that, together,they constitute the one Reality.These desires grow out of the present position of psychological teaching in theworld. There are today two dominant types of psychology, and Will Durant, in“The Mansions of Philosophy,” has well summarised them as follows:“There are, as we have seen, two ways of studying man. One begins outside withthe environment, and [14] considers man as a mechanism of adjustment; it reducesthought to things and ‘mind’ to ‘matter,’ and issues in the disguisedmaterialism of Spencer and the behaviourism of Watson.... The other way beginswithin; it looks upon man as a system of needs, impulses, and desires impellinghim to study, to use, and to master his environment; it would love to reducethings to thought, and matter to mind; it starts with the ‘entelechy’ ofAristotle (who held that an inner purpose determines every form), and issues inthe vitalism of Bergson and the pragmatism of William James.” (Will Durant, TheMansions of Philosophy, p. 257)Dr. W.B. Pillsbury believes this twofold system involves a needless duplication:“If the behaviouristic theory is retained it means that we must have twopsychologies, an external and an internal, a psychology viewed from the outsideand one viewed from the inside. This seems at the best an unnecessarycomplication.” (Dr. W. B. Pillsbury, The History of Psychology, p. 298)Recognising this duplex situation, and agreeing with Dr. Pillsbury that twolines of interpretation are unnecessary, I am convinced of the possibility offusing the two into a third, a single unit. I seek, therefore, to present anhypothesis to prove the correctness of the mechanistic school, and the equallycorrect position of the school of introspectionists, and I seek also to showthat both schools are necessary to account for all the facts, and that each isreally complementary to the other. Thus we may establish a third or compositeschool, [15] based upon the exact knowledge of the Occident and theintrospective wisdom of the Orient.In considering these two schools of psychology, it is evident that modernpsychology is largely materialistic and the most popular school entirely so. Astudy of the latest books on psychology, emanating from the many and variedschools in Europe and America, shows that the majority are primarily concernedwith endorsing or rejecting the mechanistic philosophy of the BehaviouristicSchool. If they are not thus occupied they are presenting another form of amaterialist psychology. Dr. Wolfgang Köhler in Gestalt Psychology says, forinstance:“It is the layman’s belief that in general, he himself directly feels why at onetime he has one attitude, and later on another; also that, for the most part, heknows and understands directly why he is inclined to do one thing in a certainparticular situation and why a definitely different thing under subsequentdifferent conditions. In his view, then, he is experiencing directly and trulymuch of that dynamical context, the development of which constitutes mentallife. Opposed to this belief and altogether foreign to it, we have the view ofmost learned psychologists at the present time. From their viewpoint, one isinclined to do one thing now and then another, because, in the first instance,certain nerve paths are most available, and, in the second instance, certainother paths are most open. Fortunate those people in whom the most permeablenerve paths in practice are usually the right and appropriate ones!” (WolfgangKöhler, Gestalt Psychology, p. 349)[16] All is, however, in a state of confusion, and, as has been said by WillDurant—”Psychology has hardly begun to comprehend, much less to control, humanconduct and desire; it is mingled with mysticism and metaphysics, withpsycho-analysis, behaviourism, glandular mythology and other diseases ofadolescence.” (Will Durant, The Mansions of Philosophy, p. 376)Psychology is wandering in that borderland of the unseen which we dignify withthe words energy —whether nervous, atomic or vital—force , etheric vibrations,and electric currents and charges and the freely floating force of thepsychologists, to which has been given the name libido . All the sciences seemto be converging on this same no-man’s land, on the indefinable. Perhaps theveil, when lifted, will reveal to us the promised land of man’s dreams andaspirations. A spirit of uncertainty and expectancy is paralleling thecertainties and cold facts of modern science. It is almost as if mankind werestanding before the curtain in a cosmic proscenium, waiting for it to rise andreveal the next act, in which humanity can participate intelligently. It is ahumanity with a long past, much gained experience and accumulated knowledge,which stands thus waiting, but it is also a humanity which realises that it maybe called upon to take part in a revelation and a development wholly unexpected,and for which its present equipment and understanding of life may proveinadequate.[17] Meanwhile in this cosmic proscenium, and in the approach to truth throughvarious lines, science has arranged the known facts and is deducing the nextpossible development and is proceeding in its many branches and activities uponhypotheses which, correct or incorrect, merit experiment and test. Voicing whatshould be the attitude of mind for students in all fields of human knowledge,Bertrand Russell says: “What we need is not the will to believe, but the wish tofind out, which is the exact opposite.” (Bertrand Russell, Sceptical Essays, p.157)The best type of mind to cope with this scientific situation today is that whichis sceptical, yet willing to be convinced; agnostic, yet determined toinvestigate fairly; questioning, yet open to conviction when supposed facts areproved to be favourable of demonstration; and above all broadminded, realisingthat only in the formulated truths of the many can the one Truth be known. Onlythe small mind, the little man, is atheistical, dogmatic, destructive incriticism, static, with back turned to the light, and to the new day.This searching, enquiring, scientific type of mind and of investigation isespecially appropriate in psychology, the oldest branch of knowledge in theworld, and yet the youngest to enter the realm of true scientific study. Only awillingness to consider the field as a whole, and not a particular school alone,only by reserving opinion until more is known, will the investigator avoid thedangers [18] of one whose vision is limited, who sees only isolated points butnever the panorama in which they lie, and who deals in fractions and decimalswithout ever achieving an integral unit.One of the most hopeful signs of the time is the growing understanding of theOriental point of view, and the tendency to investigate it. The psychology ofour two hemispheres is so widely different, the approach to truth so dissimilar,that only lately have students considered the possibility of their fundamentalunity, and that a new outlook on man and his environment may emerge out of thefusion of the Eastern and Western interpretations of life. Old interpretationsmay fail, yet ancient truths will stand: old misconceptions may be recognised asmisleading, but reality will radiate clearer light and beauty. From the union ofour different sciences, thought and deductions, a new psychology may emergebased on the comprehension, so familiar to the West, of the structure which manuses, and the comprehension, so familiar in the East, of the energy or spiritwith which man animates and directs his structure. These—the structure and themotivating energy—are not antagonistic but mutually interdependent. They have anessential unity.Western psychology concerns itself primarily with the structure, with thetangible objective universe and with the reaction of objective man to thatworld. It deals with man as an animated body; it emphasises the mechanics of hisnature, [19] and the instrument he uses. It is therefore mechanistic and dealsonly with that which can be subjected to tests and experiment. It investigatesthe body and accounts for the emotions and the mentality, and even for what itcalls the soul, in terms of the body. Durant points out this position in thefollowing words: “As for the Self or Soul, it is merely the sum total of thehereditary character and the acquired experiences of the organism.” (WillDurant, The Mansions of Philosophy, p. 75) It explains various types andtemperaments in terms of the mechanism. Louis Berman sums up this position inhis interesting book as follows:“The most precious bit of knowledge we possess today about Man is that he is thecreature of his glands of internal secretion. That is, Man as a distinctiveorganism is the product, the by-product, of a number of cell factories whichcontrol the parts of his make-up, much as the different divisions of anautomobile concern produce the different parts of a car. These chemicalfactories consist of cells, manufacture special substances, which act upon theother cells of the body, and so start and determine the countless processes wecall Life. Life, body and soul emerge from the activities of the magic ooze oftheir silent chemistry precisely as a tree of tin crystals arises from thechemical reactions started in a solution of tin salts by an electric current.Man is regulated by his Glands of Internal Secretion. At the beginning of thethird decade of the twentieth century, after he had struggled, for we know atleast fifty thousand years, to define and know himself, that summary may beaccepted as the truth about [20] himself. It is a far-reaching induction, but avalid induction, supported by a multitude of detailed facts.” (Louis Berman,M.D., The Glands Regulating Personlaity, p. 26)Thus Western psychology emphasises the physical and seen and, in its chosenfield, is scientific. It is constitutionally opposed to the idle and dreamingspeculations of the visionary mystic. The result of its efforts has been toisolate a body of facts which do effectively embody the truth about man, hisbehaviour and equipment. This knowledge should be invaluable in producing abetter mechanism through which a finer race can function.Western psychology, in its more extreme schools, is actively deterministic forit relates all feeling, thinking and activity to the functioning of the physicalcells and the bodily organs. Freewill is therefore largely ruled out in favourof the organism, the nervous apparatus, and of the endocrine system. Thefollowing quotations bear this out.“Watson in his ‘Psychology from the standpoint of a Behaviorist,’ would teachthat ‘emotion is an heredity pattern-reaction involving profound changes of thebodily mechanism as a whole, but particularly of the visceral and glandularsystems” (p. 195); and that ‘thought is the action of language mechanisms’ (page316); is ‘highly integrated bodily activity and nothing more’ (p. 325); and that‘when we study implicit bodily processes we are studying thought.’ By thisWatson does not mean to identify thought with the correlated cortical activityof the brain—not at all; [21] but with all the bodily processes that areinvolved, implicitly and explicitly, in the production of spoken, written andsign language—the muscular activity of the vocal apparatus, diaphragm, hands,fingers, eye-movements, etc. (p. 324). (Morton Prince, Psychologies of 1925 p.208)“Psychology studies the world with man left in it, i.e., it studies experienceas dependent upon the nervous system, whereas physics studies experience asthough existing independently of the nervous system. Psychology should,therefore, be classified with the general sciences as a discipline laying barethe general traits of mind, where mind is defined as the ‘sum total of humanexperience considered as dependent upon a nervous system.’... Psychology studiesthe total environment viewed as existing only at the moment when it affects the(human) nervous system, whereas physics studies the total environment viewed asexisting beyond the moment when it affects the (human) nervous system. (WalterS. Hunter, Psychologies of 1925, p. 95)“Thirdly, the faith of the mechanist implies two assumptions which we mustcarefully distinguish; for one of them may be false, though the other be true.These two assumptions are (1) that all processes in the world are fundamentallyof one kind only (2) that all these processes are of the kind commonly assumedby the physical sciences in their interpretations of inorganic nature; namelymechanistic, or strictly determined, and therefore strictly predictable,events.” (William McDougall, Psychologies of 1925), p. 303)Dr. Rubin says, “the physical appearance of the individual, his psychic traits,or what might be called the chemistry of his soul, are demonstrated [22] in agreat measure by the character and amount of the internal secretions of hisvarious glands.” ( Herman H. Rubin, M. D, Your Mysterious Glands, p. 54)Some schools go so far to deny consciousness altogether and regard it (theEastern investigator would say they rightly regard it) as inherent in matter.Dr. Leary says, “Consciousness characterizes nerves as vibration characterizesother forms of matter.” (Daniel H. Leary, Ph.D., Modern Psychology: Normal andAbnormal, p. 116)Thus it is defined elsewhere as “a complex integration and succession of bodilyactivities which are closely related to or involve the verbal and gesturalmechanisms and hence most frequently come to social expression.” (Walter S.Hunter, Psychologies of 1925, p. 91)Watson warns his readers that they “will find no discussion of consciousness andno reference to such terms as sensation, perception, attention, will, image andthe like. These terms are in good repute, but,” he says, “I have found I can getalong without them both in carrying out investigation and in presentingpsychology as a system to my students. I frankly do not know what they mean nordo I believe that anyone else can use them consistently. (Psychologies of 1925,p. 201, footnote)Finally we are told that “When psychology has become quite divorced from psycheand gets in bed with living beings we shall be able to throw the word‘consciousness’ into the discard—along [23] with ‘mind’ and ‘memory.’ Humanbehavior then will be on a scientific basis and not a branch of literature, orphilosophic or religious speculation. ‘Mind’ will give way to personality,‘consciousness’ in general to specific exhibitions of learned behavior, and‘memory’ to the calling out of some part of the individual’s striped orunstriped muscle-tissue organization.” (George A.. Dorsey, Why We Behave LikeHuman Beings, p. 333.)This intensely materialistic trend of Western psychology is the more surprisingwhen we remember that, according to its derivation, psychology is the ‘logos’ orword of the psyche or soul.The West, however, has its dissenting voices. There is the introspective schoolof psychology, more frequently called the introspectionist, and also thementalist. They admit the fact of consciousness and assume a conscious entity.Dr. Leary defines these groups as follows:“The introspectionist is interested in consciousness, awareness, awareness ofawareness, the self, the ‘I’ images, and all sorts of other things that thebehaviorist of strict training and rigid technology scorns, ignores anddenies.... The introspectionist turns his attention inwardly; remembers,compares mentally, derives data from self-communion, asks others to do the same;the behaviorist theoretically treats the human animal the same as he would anylower form of life, and observes merely the overt and objective responses theanimal makes in much the same manner as would be used by the physicist orchemist in observing the reactions of bodies or compounds in their laboratories.[24] Furthermore, the subjective school is apt to be ultra-rational andsystematic; the behavioristic more empirical and pragmatic....“The mentalists insist that psychical activity is not the mere reflection ofphysical activity; that over and above the body and the brain there is somethingdifferent, on a different level, call it mind, spirit, consciousness, what youwill. Thought is not the functioning of matter. The materialists on the otherhand, while differing among themselves, would hold just the reverse, namely,that all is physical, and that all human conduct, be it thinking, feeling,emotions, muscle activity or nerve activity, is all the functioning of physical,material cells, and that without such structure there can be no activity at all.Whatever acts is physical, however it acts. On the one hand we have an informingpower or spirit using the structure of the physical body; on the other we havestructure as the basis, solely and indispensably, of function, however complex,however delicate, however noble that functioning may be in terms of morals orreligion.” (Daniel H. Leary, Ph.D., Modern Psychology: Normal and Abnormal, pp.6-7)The introspectionists and mentalists have not, however, demonstrated their pointscientifically, and the position of these schools is still further weakened bythe many diverse groups into which psychology is divided. Dr. Hocking, ofHarvard, says:“True, psychology does not speak with a single voice. There is dynamicpsychology and purposive psychology, Gestalt psychology and reaction psychology,Freudian psychology, structural psychology, behavioristic psychology, andvarious other schools. They produce [25] different portraits of the self. Butthe composite of them has a distinctly physiological cast; and we may takebehaviourism as the pure instance, because it is the extreme instance, of thischaracter.” (Wm. E. Hocking, Self, Its Body and Freedom, pp. 17, 18.)A broad and general division is outlined for us by Dr. Prince as follows:“Psychologists are divided into three camps—the self-psychologists, the selflesspsychologists and the middle grounders. The first group maintain that thecontent of every conscious process includes a self—an awareness of self, aself-consciousness. Hence that all consciousness is a consciousness or awarenessof something by a self.“The second group, the selfless ones, claim to be unable to find any self, orconsciousness of self by introspection; deny its reality and hold that mentalprocesses function without any such reality. The ‘I’ and the ‘You’ are merelycompulsory expressions required by the necessities of language.” (Morton Prince,Psychologies of 1925, p. 223.)Western psychology in the mass is clearly materialistic. It is mechanistic,thriving in an age of machines and machinery.The position of the Western mechanistic psychologist is, therefore, almostimpregnably strong, for it is based upon known truths and demonstrated facts. Hecan prove his position and cite his cases, and his knowledge of the mechanism ofman which he claims is the entire man, is based upon experiment and tests, withobjective and tangible results.[26] Against this materialistic psychology, the criticism which emergesimmediately is the almost exclusive consideration that the Western Psychologistgives to subnormal, deficient, and pathological cases. The super-normal, thegenius, and the so-called highly spiritual individual have been neglected, andmuch that is beautiful, essential and true to the average man is explained away.Had He been subjected to psycho-analysis, Christ would no doubt have foundHimself neatly tabulated and classified, as suffering from a “Jehovah complex”and regarded as subject to hallucinations. Yet the type of structure that Heused, and the quality of the “consciousness characterizing His nervous system”was such that He has set His mark upon the ages. How can such a structure againbe duplicated? What can be done to reproduce a similar mechanism?Modern psychology is only at the threshold of its career, and Walt Whitmanvisions the greater field thus:“Hurrah for positive science! Long live exact demonstration!”...Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.” (Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass,p.10)In sharp contrast with the Western School is the Eastern one of which theintrospectionists and mentalists in the West, though arising independently, [27]are but a hazy reflection. Eastern psychology deals with that which it claimslies back of the form. It is spiritual and transcendental. It assumes a soul anda spirit and all its deductions and conclusions are based on this premise. Itfully admits the form and the structure, but lays the emphasis upon the one whouses the form and the energy with which he drives it forward. It is thepsychology of life and energy.From time immemorial this has been the thought of the East, and it is clearlypictured in that venerable scripture of India, The Bhagavad Gita:“The Supreme Spirit, here in the body, is called the Beholder, the Thinker, theUpholder, the Taster, the Lord, the Highest Self.“Illuminated by the power that dwells in all the senses, yet free from allsense-powers, detached, all supporting, not divided into powers, yet enjoyingall powers.“Without and within all beings, motionless, yet moving, not to be perceived isThat, because of its subtlety, That stands afar, yet close at hand. XIII:22, 14,15.“These temporal bodies are declared to belong to the eternal lord of the body,imperishable, immeasurable. II:17.“They say the sense powers are higher than objects; than the sense powers,emotion is higher; than emotion, understanding is higher; but higher thanunderstanding is He. III:42.”Thus Oriental psychology deals with the cause, with the creator, with the self,whether that self [28] is the human divine self, functioning in its own littleworld of mental, emotional and physical activities, or the great Self, in whomall lesser selves live and move and have their being. It claims its greatDemonstrators, and has produced those claiming to know the Self, and throughthat knowledge to be in touch with the subjective Self, with the Over Soul.These claims, they state, can be substantiated and proven by any who will studytheir methods and submit to their special training. In the sphere of theenergising Self, of the spirit behind and beyond, their position is as clear asthat of the Western psychologist in the realm of the energised form.The defects of the two systems are plain and produce deplorable results in eachcase. The West emphasises the mechanism, and its tendency is towards the denialof the soul and of a motivating intelligent power. For it, man is but dust ofthe ground and into his nostrils was never breathed the spirit of God. The Eastrecognises the physical but scorns it, and, in so doing, becomes responsible forthe miserable physical conditions of the Orient. Serious as these defects are,is it not true in this field also that in union there is strength?If the Self exists—and this must be demonstrated—and is the conscious divineSoul, can it not be aware of the physical plane as well as of its divineaffiliations? If it is the dominant energy, producing all manifestation—and thistoo must be proved—cannot that energy be adapted to the [29] structure which ituses in such a wise and significant manner that the best results may beachieved? Cannot the scientific knowledge of the West about the form, and theaccumulated and inherited wisdom of the East about the nature of the Soul bebrought together intelligently so that a perfect expression of the Soul may beproduced through the medium of the mechanism? Cannot matter reach upwardstowards mind and Soul and Spirit—call it what you will—and cannot Spirit,assisting that urge upward, perfect the vehicle through which it demonstrates,and thus shine more radiantly?It is in this hope that I write—the hope of combining the materialistic andintrospective psychologies, and of harmonising the West and the East, and soindicate that in their union lies strength and reality."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II — THE GLANDS AND HUMAN BEHAVIOUR[30] The study of the glands is in its infancy. Throughout the literature onthis subject, one finds statements to the effect that little is known, and thatthe inner essence—technically called “hormones”—of any particular glandularsecretion has not yet been discovered, and that mystery veils the subject. It istrue that the secretions of certain glands have been discovered, and that evenin common parlance one hears of the thyroid gland and of the administration ofthyroid extract in certain cases, but the secretions of most glands are unknownor have only partly been isolated.Under these circumstances, an intelligent layman, even if not scientificallytrained in medicine or in academic psychology, but armed with patience and astout dictionary, need not hesitate to venture upon the subject of glands andtheir secretions and effects, and, after diligent study of the availablematerial, to survey the field and report on it. Such a survey, in fact, may beof real value to the general public by supplying it with a ready summary of animportant branch of inquiry. It may also be of substantial help even to thetrained exponent, not merely enabling him to ascertain [31] the impression whichthe technical literature makes on others, but especially because a fresh mind,unhampered with scientific data, frequently gains a better perspective of thewhole field. This would be particularly so if the one, so surveying andreporting, has long been versed in the race-old beliefs and age-long convictionsof the East on the general subject of psychology.In considering the endocrine system, it is not my intention to describe it inits ordinary physiological terms and effects, such as its relation to the growthof the body, to the hair, heart, blood and organs of generation. All this can begathered out of any medical book, even those published in the last century.Rather is it my intention to ascertain what advanced and modern investigators,medical men and psychologists, infer from a study of the glands, and what theyjudge their effects to be on human behaviour, and to check the claims, so oftenmade, that the mysterious internal secretions are responsible for man’s actions,emotions and mentality—in short, for the man himself. Understand the glands,they say, and behold the man.In considering glands in this sense, I shall quote largely from the availablebooks, not merely because one is then more likely to speak as having authority,but also because one thus reflects the given view more freshly and vividly. Apartial bibliography will be found at the close of this book.[32] These books, and the trained investigators as a whole, use a terminologythat staggers the general reader. The secretion of the thyroid gland, forexample, has been labelled as “tri-iodo-tri-hydro-exygindole-propionic acid!” Asfar as possible, I shall avoid such playful expressions.Before considering the glands themselves, it is well to decide what weunderstand by “psychology.” In the West at least, it has abandoned itsderivative meaning, already given, of the logos or law, of the psyche or soul. Arecent and clear definition is given by Dr. Leary:“The science of human behavior in the largest sense of the word behavior, thesense which includes all that human beings do, all that human beings have. Inthis sense of behavior it is the behavior of the whole, integrated personalitywhich is under investigation.“Psychology deals with the organism as a whole, as an integrated and orientatedindividual in contact with other individuals in a complex external environment,partly physical and partly social, in short, as a personality.“The behavior of human beings, psychologically speaking, ... reduces tophysiological facts and findings, in turn to those of the field of biology, thento those of bio-chemistry, then to chemistry in general and then, inevitably, tophysics as the science of matter in motion.” (Daniel H. Leary, Ph.D., ModernPsychology: Normal and Abnormal, pp. 10, 14, 18)Psychology, therefore, is the science of the activity of man, as a livingorganism, in the environment [33] in which he finds himself—the science of theinterplay between man and that environment. It is the science of human conduct,but not in the ethical sense of right or wrong conduct. It is the science ofhuman behaviour, of personality. But what is there behind this behaviour?Hocking says, “The self is indeed a system of behavior. But it is a system ofpurposive behavior emerging from a persistent hope. The kernel of the self isits hope.” ( Wm. E. Hocking, Self, Its Body and Freedom, p. 46)This hope that life may be made something that is greater than it has everhitherto been, is indeed a persistent hope—we know, however, that if it is to berealised, we ourselves must help to bring about that realisation. Hence thepurposive behaviour of which Hocking speaks.In this field of human behaviour and personality, there are three main factors.There is, first, the environment. This is much more than a mere present fact, orset of facts, or a mere passive stage upon which the drama is played. It hasbeen defined as “all that is not the organism, whether cultural, social,physical, or what-not, present in fact or in record.” (Daniel H. Leary, Ph.D.,Modern Psychology: Normal and Abnormal, pp. 10, 14, 18) There is, secondly, thehuman apparatus, especially the response apparatus which we shall presentlydiscuss in greater detail. There is, finally, conduct, or the result of theinterrelation between the environment and the response apparatus, and, given acertain environment and [34] a certain response apparatus, certain lines ofconduct, it is claimed, are inevitable—the interplay of these three results inhuman behaviour.Our concern here is naturally with the second main factor, the responseapparatus.In that apparatus, certain aspects of the mechanism warrant closer attentionthan others, namely the nervous system, and the system of ductless glands, whichtwo systems are found functioning in close coordination in the human frame.It is through the nervous system, perhaps the most intricate and wonderful partof the human structure, that we contact our environment, the external world, andare adapted to function in it. Through this system we become aware of thetangible, and through the network of nerves, plus the spinal cord and brain, webecome aware of information ceaselessly conveyed to us. Messages are carriedalong the millions of telegraph lines of our nerves to the central power houseof our brain, and are then transformed in some mysterious way into information.To that information we respond: a reverse activity is instituted and we aregalvanised into action.Along with this display of incoming and outgoing nervous energy there areparallel activities in the system of ductless glands (and the muscular system)and the interlocking of activity is so great that, unless the ductless glandsare functioning normally, there will be no adequate response [35] to theinformation telegraphed and no transformation of one type of energy intoanother.The whole response apparatus, and the mechanics of the case, have been summed upin the following terms:“An organism is a transforming device which changes the incoming energy of theenvironment, received through the receptors, into outgoing energy in the form ofthe work of the muscles and glands and, at the same time, as transformingdevice, also transforms itself in terms of these and other, inwardly originatingstimuli, both sets of stimuli and both outputs of energy co-operating in thecomplete act or behavior of the organism.” (Daniel H. Leary, Ph.D., ModernPsychology: Normal and Abnormal, p. 33.)The nervous system and muscles may be loosely described as the physical responseapparatus, and the means by which physical response to the environment is made,but the nervous system and the ductless glands as the intelligent and emotionalresponse apparatus, and the means by which actual response is made.It is claimed that this latter interaction between the apparatus and theenvironment produces conduct and behaviour, that feeling and thought activityhave their seat in the endocrine system, and that even the nature of man is thusaccounted for!“It is probably true,” continues Dr. Leary, “that, in the long run, when presentspeculation has been replaced by more adequate and better [36] groundedknowledge, we will find the seat of temperament in, or in connection with, theductless glands.” (Daniel H. Leary, Ph.D., Modern Psychology: Normal andAbnormal, p. 189.)Dr. Rubin says “we are now rapidly coming to believe that all we are and all wemay ever hope to be, depends very largely upon whether or not we have been bornwith normal ductless glands.” (Rubin, H. H., Your Mysterious Glands, p. 10) AndDr. Leary says, “The emotions are more nearly concerned with interoceptors andunstriped muscles and ductless glands” than instincts are. (Daniel H. Leary,Ph.D., Modern Psychology: Normal and Abnormal, p. 61.) Dr. Cobb tells us:“... only three and a half grains of the thyroid secretion stands betweenintelligence and idiocy. It is a gruesome thought to realize that the absence ofone chemical can result in a failure of development of the mind and body of anindividual.” ( I. G. Cobb, M.D., The Glands of Destiny, p. 5.)Dr. Cobb also tells us in his Introduction that:“The action of the glands in determining the bodily build is indisputable; andthe mental outlook—the ‘behavior complexes’—of the individual appears to dependon the physical well-being; and the physical well-being undoubtedly depends uponthe successful action and interaction of the various glandular secretions....“Although we are as yet only on the fringe of the subject, we have advancedsufficiently to realize that, just as certain patterns are formed in the body bya [37] particular arrangement of the ductless glands, so does the mind receiveits quota from the same source.” (I. G. Cobb, M.D., The Glands of Destiny, pp.3, 6.)Professor J.S. Huxley in a recent lecture says, “It seems clear thattemperament, even more important than pure intellect in achieving success, islargely an affair of the balance of the various glands of internalsecretion—thyroid, pituitary, and the rest. It may well be that the appliedphysiology of the future will discover how to modify temperament.” (I. G. Cobb,M.D., The Glands of Destiny, pp. 11, 12.)In regard to this matter of temperament, Dr. Hocking remarks:“There is not the slightest reason to doubt the broad fact of the profoundeffect on temperament exercised by the glands of internal secretion, such as thethyroid or the interstitial glands or the adrenals. The stimulation of certainof these glands, or the injection of their products, or feeding therewith, mayproduce changes which would once have been thought miraculous. By administeringthyroxin a cretin may be brought to something resembling normality; if thedosage is stopped he returns to his original condition. If the dosage isincreased, unfortunately, neither he nor anyone is raised from normality togenius; we only produce another form of abnormality. And so far, no chemicaldiscoveries justify any bright hopes of improving the human normal. There are,indeed, certain drugs which make an individual feel like a genius, but unlessthe results are judged under the same influence they are strangelydisappointing. We must, therefore, not build at once too high hopes for [38] thefuture of mankind on these discoveries. But there is a genuine sense in whichthe soul has its chemistry, and ‘a deficiency of iodine will turn a clever maninto an idiot.’” (W. E. Hocking, Self, Its Body and Freedom, pp. 58, 59.)The consideration, therefore, of the ductless glands and of their effect notonly on physical structure, but on conduct as well, is of vital importance. Whatthen are the glands? And, especially, what are the ductless glands oftenmentioned? Dr. Cobb tells us:“Glands may be divided into two main groups, those which are concerned with thedrainage system—the lymphatic glands—and those which secrete products for use inthe bodily work. The lymphatic glands do not concern us here. The second group,whose duty is to contribute fluids which, acting in concert with each other,control and regulate the bodily processes, consist of two subdivisions.“The first of these contain glands with ducts, down which they discharge theircontents. The second possess no ducts, and their secretions are absorbeddirectly into the blood stream. These are known as the ductless glands, or‘endocrine organs’ and their products have been called internal secretions. Theterm ‘endocrinology’ has been applied to the study of the glands of internalsecretion.” (I. G. Cobb, M.D., The Glands of Destiny, p. 1.)The word “endocrine” it may be noted is from the Greek word “krinein,” meaning“to separate.”Dr. Rubin says: [39]“These ductless glands or organs of secretion are often referred to as the‘endocrine glands.’ Their secretions are absorbed directly into the blood, andinto the streams of nutrient lymph—the body, it would appear, thereby dispensingits own drugs.“These secretions contain the ‘hormones’ or chemical messengers of the organismwhich excite some of the most marvellous reactions known in physiology. In fact,it has been stated that hormones are to physiology what radium is to chemistry.”(H. H. Rubin, Your Mysterious Glands, pp. 8, 9.)This system of endocrine glands forms a unit functionally, working in the utmostcooperation and interdependence. Dr. Berman tells us, “The body mind is aperfect corporation. Of this corporation the glands of internal secretion arethe directors.... Behind the body, and behind the mind is this board ofgovernors.” (Louis Berman, M.D., The Glands Regulating Personality, pp. 96, 97.)All the glands, in fact, work in unison. They are known to correlate theiractivity, to balance each other, and through their united effect, it is claimed,to make a man what he is.They form, in fact, a close interlocking system with functions and organismsclearly distinct from those of other systems within the mechanism of the humanframe. The blood system and the nervous system pursue their own activities, butare closely linked to the endocrine system. The blood acts mysteriously as thecarrier of the peculiar hormones of the different glands, and the nervous system[40] seems more specifically related to the psychical development incident tothe normal, or abnormal, functioning of the endocrine glands.From this discussion of the endocrine system we come naturally to the question:What, then, are the ductless glands, one by one?Beginning with the head, and working downwards, there are seven glands ofspecial importance to be listed. These are:Name Location Secretion 1. Pineal gland Head Unknown 2. Pituitary— Head anteriorUnknown posterior Pituitrin 3. Thyroid Throat Thyroxin 4. Thymus Upper ChestUnknown 5. Pancreas Solar Plexus region Insulin 6. Adrenals— Behind the kidneyscortex Unknown medulla Adrenalin 7. Gonads Lower Abdomen Of the testes andovaries(Publisher’s Note: Since this chapter was written, experiments with the ductlessglands have continued. Details given here are not final or conclusive but thebasic postulates of the Author remain untouched. F.B.)Thus we have distributed over the head and torso a network of important glands,which, it is claimed, physiologically govern the structure, growth and chemicalchanges of the body, and, psychologically, are responsible for the emotionalreactions and the thought processes of the human being. Hence, they would be theproducers of his [41] qualities, good and bad, of his behaviour and conduct ofaffairs, and of his very character.We shall now consider the seven glands mentioned, but confining our discussionto their mental and psychic effects.1. The pineal gland—location, head—secretion, unknown.The pineal gland is cone-shaped, about the size of a pea, and is in the centreof the brain in a tiny cave behind and above the pituitary gland which lies alittle behind the root of the nose. The pineal gland is attached to the thirdventricle of the brain. It contains a pigment similar to that in the retina ofthe eye, and also collections of what have been called “brain sand particles.”Dr. Tilney says:“Numerous attempts have been made to determine what function, if any, the pinealbody possesses. Is it indispensable to life, or does it play some role importantto a particular phase of metabolic activity? We may perhaps concede that thisorgan does possess a function in man and in most mammals. It is not improbablethat this function is particularly determined by an internal secretion, asecretion, however, which is certainly not indispensable to life. The exactinfluence of the pineal secretion is still obscure.” (Frederick Tilney, M. D.,The Pineal Gland, pp. 537, 542)It has also been suggested that this gland regulates our susceptibility tolight, that it has a definite effect upon the sex nature, that it is related tobrain growth and that its active functioning [42] causes intellectual precocityas is clearly indicated in the historic case discussed below. This gland hasalso been called the third eye, and the eye of the Cyclops. Beyond these factsor conjectures, investigators frankly say they know nothing, and experimentshave produced little information. In the experiment of feeding pineal glandextract to children and to defectives the response was nothing when the subjectwas over fifteen years of age, and contradictory in all other cases, sodeduction was impossible.Until a few decades ago scant attention was paid to the pineal gland. Then camethe case, noted by Dr. Berman, in which a child was brought to a German clinicsuffering from eye trouble and headaches. He was five years old and very mature,and apparently had reached the age of adolescence. He was abnormally brightmentally, discussing metaphysical and spiritual subjects. He was stronglygroup-conscious and only happy when sharing what he had with others. After hisarrival at the clinic, he rapidly grew worse and died in a month. An autopsyshowed a tumour of the pineal gland. (Louis Berman, M.D., The Glands RegulatingPersonlaity, p. 89)As will be seen later, this historic case has a special interest in view of theconclusions of Oriental philosophers.Most of the books note that the pineal gland is stated by ancient philosophersto be the seat of the soul, and Descartes is frequently quoted as [43] saying,“In man, soul and body touch each other only at a single point, the pineal glandin the head.”In the ancient belief that the pineal gland is the seat of the soul and in thefact apparently established that the pineal gland is a distinctive gland ofchildhood and atrophies later, is there not, perhaps, some real connection, someindication of hidden truth? Children have a ready belief in God and recognitionof Him. Christ said, “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you” and “Except ye becomeas little children ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.”One is mindful too, of Wordsworth’s “Ode on Intimations of Immortality fromRecollections of Early Childhood.”“Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;The soul that rises with us, our life’s star,Hath had elsewhere its settingAnd cometh from afar;Not in entire forgetfulness,And not in utter nakedness,But trailing clouds of glory do we comeFrom God who is our home:Heaven lies about us in our infancy!Shades of the prison-house begin to closeUpon the growing Boy,But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,He sees it in his joy.The youth, who daily farther from the EastMust travel, still is Nature’s priest,And by the vision splendidIs on his way attended; [44]At length the Man perceives it die away,And fade into the light of common day.”Oriental philosophy confirms this possible connection between the pineal glandand the soul.2. Pituitary—location head—secretion of anterior gland unknown, secretion ofposterior, pituitrin.Interest in the pituitary gland has been evidenced for centuries but until thelate eighties so little was known about it that it was regarded as an organ ofexternal secretion. It is really two glands in one. It is about the size of apea and lies at the base of the brain a short distance behind the root of thenose.This gland has been called “nature’s darling treasure,” being cradled in aniche, like a “skull within a skull.” As most of the glands do, in some form orother, it has a close relation to sex, and is also related to such periodicphenomena as sleep and sex epochs. We are told that it is a gland of continuedeffort, of energy consumption, and is essential to life. It is believed tostimulate the brain cells and to have a “direct and important bearing upon thepersonality.” We are also informed that insufficient pituitary developmentcauses, or at least accompanies conspicuous moral and intellectual inferiority,and lack of self-control; but that with a good pituitary development there willalso be pronounced mental activity and endurance. It seems to have a very closeconnection with our emotional and mental qualities.[45] The pituitary, as we have said, is really two glands in one. The secretionof the post-pituitary is pituitrin.“The post-pituitary governs the maternal-sexual instincts and theirsublimations, the social and creative instincts.... It might be said to energizedeeply the tender emotions.... For all the basic sentiments (as opposed to theintellectualized self-protective sentimentalism), tender-heartedness, sympathyand suggestibility, are interlocked with its functions.”The secretion of the ante-pituitary is unknown.“The ante-pituitary has been depicted as the gland of intellectuality.... Byintellectuality we mean the capacity of the mind to control its environment byconcepts and abstract ideas.” (Louis Berman, M.D., The Glands RegulatingPersonality, p.178)Dr. Berman also adds, “Mental activity is accompanied by increased function ofthe ante-pituitary, if intellectual, or of the post-pituitary, if emotional.” (Louis Berman, M.D., The Glands Regulating Personality, p.236)From a study of these comments, it becomes apparent that the personalityqualities—emotions, whether we mean maternal instincts shared with all animals,love of one’s fellowmen, or love of God—are regarded as largely dependent uponthe condition of the pituitary gland, as is also the ability to intellectualise.Approaching the problem from a different angle, the student of the Easternwisdom proves the relative correctness of all these inferences. [46]3. Thyroid—location, throat—secretion, thyroxin.Of the thyroid gland, more is known than of the pineal gland or the pituitarybody, and from the standpoint of Eastern wisdom, this was to be expected. Thisgland is found astride the neck, above the wind-pipe, close to the larynx, andis a very large gland. It was once a sex gland, is frequently called the “thirdovary,” is always involved in ovarian cases. In the lower vertebrates it isclearly connected with the ducts of the sexual organs, but in the march ofevolution upwards, “that relationship is lost, the thyroid migrates more andmore to the head region, to become the great link between sex and brain.” (LouisBerman, M.D., The Glands Regulating Personality, p.46) We are told also that itis the great differentiator of tissues, and has anti-toxic power, preventingpoisoning and increasing resistance to poison.Above everything else, however, the thyroid gland is the controller of themetabolism of energy. It has been called the efficient lubricator of energytransformation, and is the great catalyst of energy in the body. It controls thespeed of living and is the keystone of the endocrine system. It is indispensableto life.Through the work done with subnormal people, deficients and idiots,investigators have come to the conclusion that, in the words of Dr. Berman:“Without thyroid there can be no complexity of thought, no learning, noeducation, no habit-formation, [47] no responsive energy for situations, as wellas no physical unfolding of faculty and function and no reproduction of kind,with no sign of adolescence at the expected age, and no exhibition of sextendencies thereafter.” (Louis Berman, M.D., The Glands Regulating Personality,p. 55)We are also told that“Sensitivity, the ability to discriminate between grades of sensation oracuteness of perception is another thyroid quality. Just as the thyroid plus ismore energetic, so is he more sensitive. He feels things more, he feels painmore readily, because he arrives more quickly at the stage when the stimulusdamages his nerve apparatus.” (Louis Berman, M.D., The Glands RegulatingPersonality, p. 180)The thyroid, like the pituitary, has also close connection with the memory.“... the pituitary seems to be related to preservation of the memory deposit....The thyroid memory applies particularly to perception and precepts, thepituitary to conception (reading, studying, thinking) and concepts.”(LouisBerman, M.D., The Glands Regulating Personality, p. 182)4. Thymus—location, upper chest—secretion, unknown.Of the thymus gland, we know practically nothing, and it is one of the mostmysterious of all. Like the pineal gland, it is regarded as a gland ofchildhood, but both as yet baffle investigation.The thymus gland is situated in the chest, covers the upper portion of theheart, and, perhaps, has relation to nutrition and growth. It seems to be [48]connected with the irresponsible nature of children, and, when over-functioningin adult years, produces the irresponsible man or woman, and the amoral people.5. Pancreas—location, solar plexus region—secretion, insulin.Most of the information given in connection with the pancreas is strictlyphysiological, and, therefore, out of place here. Suffice it to say, however,that it lies in the abdomen and is close to the solar plexus (which is the brainof the instinctual animal nature) and is closely concerned with the“mobilization of energy for physical and mental purposes. It has two secretions,both insulin, one concerned with the digestive processes and the other known tobe vital to the metabolism of sugar. Without sufficient sugar for the cells, nomuscle work or nerve work—essentials in the struggle for existence—arepossible.” (Louis Berman, M.D., The Glands Regulating Personality, p. 55)6. Adrenals—location behind the kidneys—secretion of the cortex adrenalsunknown, of the medulla adrenals adrenalin.The adrenal glands are each of them dual and are situated on both sides of theabdomen, astride and back of the kidneys. They are concerned with generalgrowth, and the growth of the brain cells. The adrenal cortex secretion (towhich no name has been given) is one source of the internal secretions producingmaturity.[49] The adrenal glands, however, are primarily the glands of combat. Theyproduce that immediate and active response which men exhibit in times of dangeror anger, and their secretion is stimulated in times of emergency. Pain, rageand fear have a definite effect upon the discharge, and we are told, “all theevidence points to its medulla as the secretor of the substance which makes forthe phenomena of fear, and to its cortex as dominant in the reactions of anger.”(Louis Berman, M.D., The Glands Regulating Personality, p. 76)Also:“Courage is so closely related to fear and anger that all are always associatedin any discussion. Courage is commonly thought of as the emotion that is theopposite of fear. It would follow that courage meant simply inhibition of theadrenal medulla. As a matter of fact the mechanism of courage is more complex.One must distinguish animal courage and deliberate courage. Animal courage isliterally the courage of the beast. As noted, animals with the largest amountsof adrenal cortex are the pugnacious, aggressive, charging kings of the fieldsand forests. The emotion experienced by them is probably anger with a sort ofblood-lust, and no consideration of the consequences. The object attacked actedlike a red rag waved at a bull—it had stimulated a flow of the secretion of theadrenal cortex, and the instinct of anger became sparked, as it were, by the newcondition of the blood. In courage, deliberate courage, there is more thaninstinct. There is an act of volition, a display of will. Admitting that withoutthe adrenal cortex such courage would be impossible, the chief credit forcourage [50] must be ascribed to the ante-pituitary. It is the properconjunction of its secretion and that of the adrenal cortex that makes for truecourage. So it is we find that acts of courage have been recorded most often ofindividuals of the ante-pituitary type.” (Louis Berman, M.D., The GlandsRegulating Personality, p. 177)Gonads—location, lower abdomen—secretion, that of male testes and femaleovaries.The gonads or interstitial glands are the sex glands of external secretion, butare known to have an internal secretion also. Their gross secretion is themedium for reproduction. It is unnecessary to dwell at length upon the effectsof the gonads on personality. The sex impulse and its various subsidiaryeffects, both physical and psychical, are well recognised and much studied, andthis study, largely of perversions and inhibitions, has proved of paramountimportance to the understanding of humanity. Some psychologists relate all humanreactions—physical, emotional and mental—to sex and sex alone, and, back ofevery extreme position, we know there lies a substratum of truth. Others regardsex as playing an important part, but not as responsible for the entire story.The Eastern wisdom offers an interpretation which warrants consideration andwhich will appear when we consider the force centres and their relation to theglands.Of all the foregoing, and of many books and articles on the subject, thefollowing may be given as a brief summary.[51] The whole subject is in an experimental stage, and much remains to be done.Clearly, however, there is a close relationship between the glands and asimilarity of function, and most of them have to do with the metabolism of thebody and with growth, and all of them seem closely related to sex life. Finally,they determine, apparently, the type and temperament of the personality.Experimental as the science is, man seems to have been psycho-analysed andunderstood at last. Those elusive and intangible processes, called emotions andmental concepts, are accounted for in terms of matter. To the glands and to thenervous system, and to the poor or good development and functioning of man’sapparatus of contact and response, is ascribed all that he is. A saint can bemade into a sinner and the sinner into a saint, and this merely by increasing ordecreasing certain internal secretions. Thus a man is no better, no worse, thanthe equipment with which he comes into the world and his mechanism is the sumtotal of him. He can improve it or misuse it, but the apparatus is thedetermining factor. Free-will is eliminated and immortality denied. The best aman can do is so to act that he is happy and, also, to shoulder theresponsibility of building better bodies in order that the next generation canmanifest better psychically.Whether we agree with those conclusions or disagree, we must at least admitthat, with the mechanism the object of all study, it should eventually [52] bepossible to ascertain the laws and methods by which perfect bodies may beconstructed which, in turn, can be the instruments through which a perfectpsychic nature can function.But are all these conclusions as to the endocrine glands, in fact correct? Hasman, in outline, been classified and labelled, and does there remain only thefilling of blanks in the general outline? Who can say? But to my mind the answerlies in two questions or groups of questions, the one primarily a matter of theindividual, and the second all-embracing.As for the individual, are glands and glandular functions primary causes, or arethey merely effects or instrumentalities? Is there not, in truth, somethinggreater which lies beyond? Is there not in each of us a soul which functionsthrough the whole physical and psychic mechanism? Was not St. Paul, in short,right in saying that man has a natural body and a spiritual body, and inimplying that the glory of the natural is one, and the glory of the spiritualanother?And as for the second and broader question, is a mere mechanism the be-all andend-all of existence, and our only guiding star the perfecting of thatmechanism? Then, indeed, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” Is it notthat there is not only a finer self in us—call it spirit, soul, or what youwill—but does it not, itself form a part of a transcendent whole—call it God asreligion does, or Oversoul as Emerson does, or by any other [53] name—but in anycase a transcendent whole, the glory and radiance of which surpass allunderstanding? Shall we never be at-one with That, and meanwhile the longing forthat at-one-ment lead us onward? Shall this corruptible never put onincorruption, or this mortal never put on immortality? Shall death never beswallowed up in victory?For answers to these questions, let us turn to the Wisdom of the East."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III — THE THEORY OF THE ETHERIC BODY[54] The Oriental psychologist starts with that which the Occidental regards ashypothetical. He lays the emphasis upon the spiritual nature of man, andbelieves that the physical nature itself is the result of spiritual activity. Heasserts that all that is objectively seen is but the outward manifestation ofinner subjective energies. He regards the entire mechanics of the cosmos and ofman as effects, and believes the scientist is dealing only with effects. Hisposition may be summed up as follows:First: There is nothing but energy, and it functions through a substance whichinterpenetrates and actuates all forms, and which is analogous to the ether ofthe modern world. Matter is energy or spirit in its densest form, and spirit ismatter in its most sublimated aspect.Second: As all forms are interpenetrated by this ether, every form has anetheric form or etheric body.Third: As the tiny atom has a positive nucleus, or positive nuclei, as well asnegative aspects, so in every etheric body there are positive centres of forcein the midst of negative substance. The human being too has an etheric bodywhich is positive to the negative physical body, which galvanises it [55] intoactivity, and which acts as its coherent force, holding it in being.Fourth: The etheric body of man has seven main nuclei of energy through whichvarious types of energy flow, producing his psychical activity. These nuclei arerelated to the cerebro-spinal system, and the base of this psychical activity,or the seat of the soul nature, is situated in the head. The governing principletherefore is in the head and from this centre the entire mechanism should bedirected, and energised through the medium of the other six force centres.Fifth: Only certain centres are now functioning in man and the rest arequiescent. In a perfect human being all the centres will function fully andproduce perfect psychical unfoldment and a perfect mechanism.This Oriental emphasis upon spiritual energy and the Occidental emphasis uponthe structure or mechanism, it will be seen, accounts fully for the psychicalnature of man, both in its higher and in its lower aspects.To unite the Eastern or vitalistic conception, and the Western or mechanisticconception, and so bridge the gap between them, it is necessary to establish thefact of the existence of the etheric body.The Oriental system is abstruse and intricate, and defies summarisation. Still,some brief introduction must be made and the following outline is thereforegiven. It is incomplete, but if it gives an [56] intelligible survey of thefield, however brief, it will serve its purpose.In giving this outline, we shall make positive statements instead of continuallyrepeating that “the Eastern psychologist believes” or “the Orientalist states”or similar expressions. It is enough to recognise once and fully that to theWestern mind it must be presented as an hypothesis, to be submitted to test, tostand proved or fall disproved.With this introduction we proceed to outline the Eastern theory.There is a universal substance, the source of all, but so sublimated, so subtlethat it is truly beyond the real grasp of human intelligence. In comparison withit, the most delicate fragrance, the dancing radiance of sunbeams, the crimsonglory of the sunset, are gross and earthly. It is “a web of light,” foreverinvisible to human eye.The key word “substance” with its suggestion of materiality is a misnomer. It ishelpful however, to reduce this word to its Latin roots: “sub” under and “sto”to stand. So, substance is that which stands underneath, or underlies. Thespelling, or misspelling “sub-stans” is more indicative and suggestive.Subtle and fugitive as this universal substance is, yet in another sense it isdenser even than matter. If we could conceive of an agent outside of universalsubstance—an hypothesis contrary to all fact and possibility—and if such anexternal agent attempted to compress universal substance, or in some [57] otherway affect it from without, then substance would be found denser than any knownmaterial.Inherent in substance, and a perpetual counterpart of it, is life, incessantlife. Life and substance are one and the same, one and forever inseparable, butdifferent aspects however, of the one reality. Life is as positive electricity,substance negative. Life is dynamic, substance static. Life is activity orspirit, and substance form or matter. Life is the father and begets, substanceis the mother and conceives.In addition to these two aspects of life and substance, there is still a third.Life is theoretical or potential activity, and needs a field of operation.Substance furnishes this and in the union of life and substance, there flamesforth active energy.Thus we have a single reality, universal substance—but at the same time aco-existent duality—life and substance; and at the same time, a coexistenttrinity, life, substance, and the resultant interaction which we callconsciousness or soul.The entire manifested world arises from energy (and the co-factors substance andconsciousness). All that is seen, from the tiniest grain of sand to the widestsweep of starry heaven, from an African savage to a Buddha or a Christ, all areoutgrowths of energy. Matter is energy in its densest or lowest form; spirit isthis same Energy in highest or most subtle form. So matter is spirit descendingand debased; spirit, conversely, is matter ascending and glorified.[58] In taking on density, energy takes on, or descends into, seven degrees orplanes. Man exemplifies three. He has his physical body, his emotional mechanismand his mind-body, and consequently functions on three planes, or is awake onthree, the physical, the emotional and the mental. He is on the threshold of therecognition of a fourth and higher factor, the Soul, the Self, and will nextawaken to that realisation. The three higher planes require no comment in thiselementary discussion.In addition to seven planes, each plane has seven subplanes. We shall discussonly the seven subplanes of the lowest or physical plane.Three subplanes of the physical are known to every school-boy—the solid, liquidand gaseous, for example, ice, water and steam. In addition there are foursubtler planes, or rather four different types of ether. These four areco-existent with each of the three well known subplanes, and interpenetratethem.The physical body of man is no exception. It, too, has its etheric counterpart,its etheric body. This is positive, while the dense physical body is negative.The etheric body is the cohesive factor, and maintains the physical body in lifeand being.The etheric counterpart, whether of man or of any physical thing, is of theuniversal substance, of universal life, and of universal energy. It partakes ofall of these. But it is not self-sufficient or independently existing. It drawsupon the reservoir [59] of universal energy, and in it the etheric counterpartlives and moves and has its being. Energy is thus functioning through theetheric.This is true of man also. The universal energy functions through his ethericbody. And as man exists on seven planes, so the etheric body has seven points ofcontact with energy—but as only three planes are active, and four dormant, soonly three force centres are fully developed and four as yet undeveloped. Ofthis, more later.In harmonising the two schools, the question naturally arises, does WesternScience corroborate the Eastern theory?No less a scientist than Sir Isaac Newton accepts the universal medium of etherwithout question. In the last paragraph of his Principia, he says:“And now we might add something concerning a certain most subtle spirit whichpervades and lies hid in all gross bodies; by the force and action of whichspirit the particles of bodies mutually attract one another at near distances,and cohere if contiguous; and electric bodies operate to greater distances, aswell repelling as attracting the neighbouring corpuscles; and light is emitted,reflected, refracted, inflected, and heats bodies; and all sensation is excited,and the members of animal bodies move at the command of the will, namely by thevibrations of this spirit, mutually propagated along the solid firmaments of thenerves, from the outward organs of sense to the brain, and from the brain intothe muscles. But these are things that cannot be explained in few words, nor arewe furnished with that sufficiency of experiments which is required to anaccurate determination and [60] demonstration of the laws by which this electricand elastic spirit operates.” (Edwin Arthur Burtt, Ph.D., MetaphysicalFoundations of Modern Physical Science, p. 275)Thus it can be argued from the above that Newton recognised the facts of theetheric body, underlying all forms, including the human.As Newton is not of this century or the last, let us turn to a recent edition(1926) of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The following discussion is given underthe heading of “ether.”“Whether space is a mere geometrical abstraction, or whether it has definitephysical properties which can be investigated, is a question which in one formor another has often been debated. As to the parts which are occupied by matter,that is by a substance which appeals to the senses, there has never been anydoubt; and the whole of science may be said to be an investigation of theproperties of matter. But from time to time attention has been directed to theintervening portions of space from which sensible matter is absent; and thisalso has physical properties, of which the complete investigation has hardlybegun.“These physical properties do not appeal directly to the senses, and aretherefore comparatively obscure; but there is now no doubt of their existence;even among those who still prefer to use the term space. But a space endowedwith physical properties is more than a geometrical abstraction, and is mostconveniently thought of as a substantial reality, to which therefore some othername is appropriate. The term used is unimportant, but long ago the term ETHERwas invented; it was adopted by Isaac Newton, and is good enough for us. Theterm ether therefore [61] connotes a genuine entity filling all space, withoutany break or cavity anywhere, the one omnipresent physical reality, of whichthere is a growing tendency to perceive that everything in the material universeconsists; matter itself being in all probability one of its modifications....“Thus an ether is necessary for the purpose of transmitting what is calledgravitational force between one piece of matter and another, and for the stillmore important and universal purpose of transmitting waves of radiation betweenone piece of matter and another however small and distant they be....“The properties of the ether are not likely to be expressible in terms ofmatter; but, as we have no better clue, we must proceed by analogy, and we mayapologetically speak of the elasticity and density of the ether as representingthings which, if it were matter, would be called by those names. What theseterms really express we have not yet fathomed; but if, as is now regarded asvery probable, atomic matter is a structure in ether, there is every reason forsaying that the ether must in some sense be far denser than any known materialsubstance....“Matter therefore is comparatively a gossamer structure, subsisting in a verysubstantial medium....” (Encyclopedia Britannica, 13th Edition: Article: Ether)These views are amplified by other scientists of note.Writing in the 17th century, Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist as quoted byDr. Burtt said:“Whence, I ask if it be unworthy of a philosopher to inquire of a philosopher ifthere be not in nature an incorporeal substance, which, while it can impress onany body all the qualities of body, or at least most [62] of them, such asmotion, figure, position of parts, etc., ... would be further able, since it isalmost certain that this substance removes and stops bodies, to add whatever isinvolved in such motion, that is, it can unite, divide, scatter, bind, form thesmall parts, order the forms, set in circular motion those which are disposedfor it, or move them in any way whatever, arrest their circular motion, and dosuch similar further things with them as are necessary to produce according toyour principles light, colours, and the other objects of the senses.... Finally,incorporeal substance having the marvellous power of cohering and dissipatingmatter, of combining it, dividing it, thrusting it forth and at the same timeretaining control of it, by mere application of itself without bonds, withouthooks, without projections or other instruments; does it not appear probablethat it can enter once more in itself, since there is no impenetrability tofrustrate it, and expand itself again, and the like.”In discussing Henry More, Dr. Burtt goes on to say:“In this passage More extends his reasoning from the conclusion of anincorporeal substance in human beings to the assumption of a similar and greaterincorporeal substance in nature as a whole, for he was convinced that the factsof science showed nature to be no more a simple machine than is a humanbeing.”(Edwin Arthur Burtt, Ph.D., Metaphysical Foundations of Modern PhysicalScience, pp. 131-132)Also writing in the 17th century, Robert Boyle brought forward the samehypothesis and ascribed two functions to ether, to propagate motion bysuccessive impacts and to be a medium through which [63] curious phenomenamanifested, such as magnetism, Boyle said:“That there may be such a substance in the universe, the asserters of it willprobably bring for proofs several of the phenomena I am about to relate; butwhether there be or be not in the world any matter that exactly answers to thedescriptions they make of their first and second elements I shall not herediscuss, though divers experiments seem to argue that there is an etherealsubstance, very subtle and not a little diffused.” (Edwin Arthur Burtt, Ph.D.,Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science, pp. 182, 183)Coming again to modern times Sir William Barrett said:“The universe presents us with an assemblage of phenomena—physical, vital, andintellectual—the connecting link between the worlds of intellect and matterbeing that of organized vitality, occupying the whole domain of animal andvegetable life, throughout which, in some way inscrutable to us, movements amongthe molecules of matter are originated of such a character as apparently tobring them under the control of an agency other than physical, superseding theordinary laws which regulate the movements of inanimate matter, or in otherwords, giving rise to movements which would not result from the action of thoselaws uninterfered with; and therefore implying, on the very same principle, theorigination of force.” (Sir William Barrett, On the Threshold of the Unseen, p.274)The Eastern teaching regards the vital body as the intermediary between thephysical and the intellectual: it acts as the agency of the mind in a humanbeing and of the Universal Mind in a solar [64] system, and it is interesting tonote in this connection Sir William Barrett’s threefold enumeration of“physical, vital and intellectual.”Sir Oliver Lodge, though often criticised for his views as to communicationbetween the living and the dead, is, in matters of pure science, in the frontrank of this age. He says:“What about the Ether which holds the atoms together, the welding ether which isessential to the characteristic configuration of a body—which is as essential asthe matter itself?“We do not usually attend to the ether aspect of a body; we have no sense organfor its appreciation, we only directly apprehend matter. Matter we apprehendclearly when young children, but as we grow up we infer the Ether, too, or someof us do. We know that a body of characteristic shape, or indeed of any definiteshape, cannot exist without the forces of cohesion—cannot exist thereforewithout the Ether—meaning by the Ether now, not the whole, but theunmaterialized part of it, the part which is the region of strain, thereceptacle of potential energy, the substance in which the atoms of matter areembedded. Not only is there a matter body, there is also an ether body: the twoare coexistent.” (Sir Oliver Lodge, Ether and Reality, pp. 161, 162)He takes up the same subject again in an article which appeared in The HibbertJournal and presents some most interesting and suggestive conclusions, asfollows:“Light is an affection of the ether. Light is to ether as sound is to matter....Subject to all the laws of [65] time and space, fully amenable to the laws ofenergy, largely the source of terrestrial energy, governing all themanifestations of physical forces, at the root of elasticity and tenacity andevery other static property of matter, the ether is just beginning to take itsrightful place in the scheme of physics....“Electric charges, composed of modified ether, are likely to prove to be thecosmic building material.... There is the great bulk of undifferentiated ether,the entity which fills all space and in which everything material occurs. Aduality runs through the scheme of physics—matter and ether.“All kinetic energy belongs to what we call matter, whether in the atomic or thecorpuscular form; movement or locomotion is its characteristic. All staticenergy belongs to the ether, the unmodified and universal ether; itscharacteristics are strain and stress. Energy is always passing to and fro fromone to the other—from ether to matter or vice versa—and in this passage is allwork done.“Now, the probability is that every sensible object has both a material and anetherial counterpart. One side only are we sensibly aware of, the other we haveto infer. But the difficulty of perceiving this other side—the necessity forindirect inference—depends essentially and entirely on the nature of our senseorgans, which tell us of matter and do not tell us of ether. Yet one is as realand substantial as the other, and their fundamental joint quality is coexistenceand interaction. Not interaction everywhere and always, for there are plenty ofregions without matter—though there is no region without ether; but thepotentiality of interaction, and often the conspicuous reality of it, everywhereprevails and constitutes the whole of our purely mundane experience.”[66] In a supplementary note to the article, he says:“Ether belongs to the physical frame of things, no one supposes it be a psychicentity; but it probably subserves psychical purposes, just as matter does.Professors Tait and Balfour Stewart surmised a psychic significance for theether of space so long ago as 1875, and treated it from a religious point ofview in that much criticized book The Unseen Universe. And that greatmathematical physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, concluded his article “Ether” inthe ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica with an expression of faith,not indeed in this speculation, about which he evinced great caution, but in thereal existence of a supersensuous universal connecting medium, and in theprobability of its having many unsuspected functions.” (Sir Oliver Lodge, Matterand Soul, Hibbert Journal, January, 1919)Dr. Sajous, Professor of Endocrinology in Pennsylvania University asserts hisbelief in this universal medium in the following terms:“It seems plain that the need of a primary intelligent and coordinative creativemedium such as the ether asserts itself on all sides....“The ether, as interpreted by scientists, meets all these conditions and is theonly medium known to science that is capable of doing so. It is invisible,permeates all matter and pervades all space by wave motion, without limit in theuniverse. It offers practically no resistance to radiant energy, even to lightfrom the sun and the most distant stars discovered. It is the medium whichtransmits ‘radio’ waves, wireless telegraphy waves, Becquerel rays, X- orRoentgen rays, etc. [67]“The ether is endowed with creative power in space and on earth.... The ether ofspace, therefore, builds solar systems as it does matter, with co-ordination andintelligence, and endows all chemical elements it forms with the properties theyare known to possess....” (Chas. E. de M. Sajous, M.D., ScD., LLD., Strength ofReligion as Shown by Science, pp. 152,153)Dr. Joad of Oxford University pictures for us the activity of this vital force,of the ‘livingness’ animating matter and shows the relationship between life andform. He comes close indeed, to the Eastern theory of the etheric counterpartand the energy functioning through it.“The Life Force. Let us suppose that in the first instance the universe waspurely material. It was chaos, deadness and blankness, without energy orpurpose, and devoid of life. Into this inorganic universe there is introduced atsome stage or other, and from some source unexplained, a principle of life, andby life I mean a something which is not expressible in terms of matter. At firstblind and stumbling, a purely instinctive thrust or pulse, it seeks to expressitself by struggling to achieve an ever higher degree of consciousness. We mayconceive the ultimate purpose of the life force to be the achievement ofcomplete and universal consciousness, a result which can only be secured by thepermeation of the whole universe with life and energy, so that beginning as aworld of ‘matter’ it may end as a world of ‘mind,’ or ‘spirit.’ With this objectit works in and through matter, infusing and permeating matter with its ownprinciple of energy and life. To matter so infused we give the name of a livingorganism. Living organisms are to be regarded [68] in the light of the tools orweapons which the life force creates to assist it in the accomplishment of itspurpose. Like the universe itself, each living organism is formed of asubstratum of matter which has been animated by life, much as a length of wiremay be charged with an electric current. It is a current of life which has beeninsulated in a piece of matter.“The life force is far from being all-powerful. It is limited by the matterwhich it seeks to overcome, and its methods are experimental, varying accordingto the stage of evolution which, in the persons of the organisms created by it,it has succeeded in reaching. Different types of beings best serve its purposeat different stages.” (C. E. M. Joad, B.A., Mind and Matter, pp. 178, 179)Will Durant, doubtless the most widely read and popular author on philosophicalsubjects, says:“The more we study matter the less we see it as fundamental, the more weperceive it as merely the externality of energy, as our flesh is the outwardsign of life and mind.... In the heart of matter, giving it form and power, issomething not material, possessed of its own spontaneity and life; and thissubtle, hidden and yet always revealed vitality is the final essence ofeverything that we know.... Life is first, and within; matter, coeval with it intime and inextricable from it in space, is second to it in essence, in logic,and in significance; matter is the form and visibility of life....“The life is not a function of the form, the form is a product of the life; theweight and solidity of matter are the result and expression of intra-atomicenergy, and every muscle or nerve in the body is the moulded instrument ofdesire.” (Will Durant, Mansions of Philosophy, pp. 66,67, 80, 81)[69] These books and scientists show that the Eastern doctrine of an ethericbody, the medium of a vital force, of energy or life, is not the vague dream ofa mystically inclined people, but is regarded as a fact in nature by manypractical minded Occidental investigators.In summarising our ideas we might formulate them as follows:Behind the objective body lies a subjective form constituted of etheric matterand acting as a conductor of the life principle of energy, or prana. This lifeprinciple is the force aspect of the soul, and through the medium of the ethericbody the soul animates the form, gives it its peculiar qualities and attributes,impresses upon it its desires and, eventually directs it through the activity ofthe mind. Through the medium of the brain the soul galvanises the body intoconscious activity and through the medium of the heart all parts of the body arepervaded by life.This theory has a close correspondence to the animistic theory of the West andwill be defined later. The term animism has sufficed up to the present, but islikely to be superseded by that of “dynamism,” owing to the developments takingplace within the human consciousness itself. Man, being now a fullyself-conscious entity and the personality being now integrated and functioning,the time has come when he can, for the first time, demonstrate conscious purposeand directive will.The three states of man’s nature, referred to [70] earlier in thischapter—physical, sentient and mental—form a coordinated unity for the firsttime in the history of the race. The directing self, therefore, can now takecontrol, and, through the mind, acting on the vital or etheric body and havingits point of contact in the brain, drive its instrument into fully controlledexpression, and subsequent creative activity. Thus will emerge what Keyserlingcalls the “deeper Being.” He says:“The next question is whether and how it is possible to develop deeper Being.When we speak of the Being of a man in contradistinction to his ability, we meanhis vital soul; and when we say that this Being decides, we mean that all hisutterances are penetrated with individual life, that every single expressionradiates personality, and that this personality is ultimately responsible. Nowsuch a penetration can actually be achieved where it does not already exist. Itis possible, thanks for the fact that man as a being possessing a mind and asoul represents a Sense connection within which his consciousness moves freely.He is free to lay the emphasis wherever he pleases; according to the ‘place’thus stressed the psychic organism actually shifts its centre, and thus actuallyobtains a new centre of Being. Therefore, if theoretical inquiry shows that itdepends upon the centring of consciousness, whether the centre of a man lies inhis Being or at the surface, then it must be practically possible to induce thenecessary process of shifting. Hence in principle everybody can succeed inraising his Being; to this end he need only persistently lay the emphasis on hisessential Being, persistently demand of himself that he should never utteranything but what is really consistent with his inner Being. Surely the task isa [71] hard one. Its solution is not only a very slow process; it necessitates aspecific technique of training.” (Count Hermann Keyserling, CreativeUnderstanding, pp. 180, 181)The possibility of man functioning as a soul, as a synthesis of mechanism, lifeand purpose, will, I believe, be greatly hastened when the Eastern and Westernpsychologies are merged and the relationship of the Glands to the vital body,with its centres of force, studied and understood. Hocking, in this connection,comes to this conclusion:“There seems reason to hope for a better physical future of the race by the aidof a sound mental hygiene. After the era of the charlatans has gone by, and tosome extent by their aid, there appears a possibility of steadily enlargingself-mastery, as the spiritual sense of such discipline as the Yoga joins withthe sober elements of Western psychology and a sane system of ethics. No one ofthese is worth much without the others.” ( Wm. E. Hocking, Self, Its Body andFreedom)Two points merit discussion, before we pass on to a detailed account of theEastern teaching as to the force centres. One is a consideration as to thenature of the soul, and the other is an attempt to consider the testimony of thecenturies as to the probable location of the soul consciousness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV — THE NATURE OF THE SOUL AND ITS LOCATION[72] Throughout the ages the soul has been the subject of discussion, ofargument, and of attempted definition. It has been, and still is, the paramountintellectual interest of the ages, and the outstanding theme of all religionsand philosophies. From this alone, we may perhaps deduce that the soul ispossibly a fact in nature, for the testimony of millennia must have some basisin reality. After the elimination of all conclusions founded on the visions andexperiences of hysterics, of neurotics, and of pathological cases, there remainsa residue of testimony and a structure of deduction, emanating from sane andreputable thinkers, philosophers and scientists, which evades negation andwarrants recognition by humanity.Dr. Richard Müller-Freienfels says, “To write the history of man’s belief in thesoul one would have at the same time to write the history of the whole humanrace.” (Richard Müller-Freienfels, Mysteries of the Soul, p. 24)The problem has been well summarized for us by Professor Ames:“On the one side was this self or soul, with its thinking; on the other, all theworld of objects, other persons [73] and God. The efforts of wise men forcenturies have been to find a way to span the chasm between the self and otherobjects. But with ideas as events in the head, and things existing outside,there was no sure bridge upon which to make the passage that alone couldguarantee that the representations in the head were true to the objects in theouter realm. Upon the two sides of this gulf have been arrayed the armies ofphilosophers: the idealists upon the side of the self, vainly trying to stretchthemselves to reach the reality they have posited as separated from their grasp;and on the opposite side the materialists, striving to ignore the self or toregard it as a phantom, or epiphenomenon, a breath or mist, exuding from thephysical world itself. Some, called dualists, assumed the reality of both thepsychical and the physical, but allowed each its place and never succeeded in anadequate answer to the question as to how the mind goes out of itself to sodifferent an object, or how the object could be itself and yet be known.”(Edward Scribner Ames, Prof. of Philosophy, Universtity of Chicago, Religion,pp. 127-128)Some definitions of the soul might here have place. They have been gathered outof a vast number. It is noticeable that there is a very remarkable uniformity indefinition and exegesis. Webster defines the soul in most interesting terms, andfrom the standpoint of the Eastern wisdom, with great exactitude.“An entity, conceived as the essence, substance, or actuating cause ofindividual life, especially of life manifested in psychical activities; thevehicle of individual existence, separate in nature from the body and usuallyheld to be separable in existence.”[74] As one investigates the different interpretations as to the nature of thesoul, three points of view emerge and these have been well summarised for us inWebster’s Dictionary:“First, the soul has been treated as an entity or subject, manifested especiallyin man’s volitional thinking activities; it is the subject of the experiencemeditated by the body; it is not the mind, but that which thinks and wills.“Second, the soul is identified with the mind or with conscious experience; thisis the usual sense of the word in psychology, and is the general conception ofidealists.“Third, the soul is treated as a function or the sum of the functions of thebrain; thus Pierre J. G. Cabanis (1757-1808) taught that the brain secretesthought as the stomach digests food.”Webster adds the following comment which is appropriate in its application tothe present trend of world thought:“Some conceptions, such as that of Fechner, that the soul is the whole unitary,spiritual process in conjunction with the whole unitary bodily process, appearto stand mid-way between the idealistic and materialistic views.” (Webster’sDictionary, Edition of 1923)Perhaps, after all, the “noble middle path” which the Buddhist emphasises, holdsfor the coming generation a way of escape from these extreme positions.The Egyptians held the soul was a divine ray, [75] acting through a peculiar,fluid-like compound, whilst the Jews regarded it as the vital principle. TheHindus teach that the human soul is a portion of an immutable Principle, theSoul of the World, the Anima Mundi, the all-pervading Ether (Akasa) of space.This Ether is simply the conductor of certain types of energy and serves as theinterrelating medium between essential spirit and tangible matter.Pythagoras, who did so much in his day to link the Eastern and Westernphilosophies, gave the same teaching. In China, Lao-tse taught that thespiritual soul is united to the semi- material vital soul, and between them theyanimate the physical body. The Greeks, in their turn, held that the soul (withall the mental faculties) was separable from the body, whilst the Romansregarded the soul as a triplicity—a spiritual soul, an intellectual soul or themind, and a vital body. Many, such as Theophrastus, regarded it as “the realprinciple of passion” and“The Stoics gave currency to a new designation of the animating principle ortheory of the vital processes, namely pneuma.... With the introduction of thepneuma began that trichotomy of human personality into body, soul and spirit,which has figured prominently in the speculations of theologians. The conceptionof the soul or psyche ... became differentiated into two conceptions ... namely,on the one hand, the vital force of the physiologists, and on the other hand thespirit or immaterial soul of man.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D., In Search of theSoul, Vol. I, pp. 53-54.[76] The Stoics therefore emphasised a teaching which is entirely in line withthe Oriental philosophy. They bridged the gap therefore between the twohemispheres.Plato expounded the doctrine of the soul in the following manner:“He believed the soul to have three parts. One, an immortal or rational part,coming from God; another a mortal, animal or sensitive part, the seat ofappetite and sensation, belonging to the body; and a third, lying between theseand making their interaction possible—will or spirit—by means of which reasonconquered desire. Plants have the lowest part; animals the two lower; but therational part is exclusively human.“This rational soul he regarded as immaterial and metaphysical in nature,incapable of being perceived by the senses, and only to be grasped by theintellect. The union with the mortal, material and physical body was only aminor incident of its long career.... Plato thus drew a fundamental distinctionbetween soul and body.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D., In Search of the Soul, Vol. I,p. 35).Aristotle regarded the soul as the sum of the vital principles and as being tothe body what vision is to the eye. The soul was to him the true Being in thebody, and with him Plotinus was in agreement. He regarded the soul as the livingsentiency of the body, belonging to a higher degree of being than matter.Tertullian divided the soul into two parts, a vital and a rational principle, asdid St. Gregory. Most of the Oriental schools regard [77] the soul as the self,the individual, and Christian mysticism is concerned with the elaboration of theteaching of St. Paul, that there dwells in each human being a potentiality whichis called by him “Christ in you,” and which, through its presence, enables everyman eventually to attain the status of the Christ. A close comparison of theChristian and Oriental teachings leads to the conclusion that the terms: Self,Soul, Christ, connote the same state of being or consciousness, and indicate thesubjective reality in every man.The early Christian Fathers were tremendously influenced by Greek ideas as tothe Soul, and their teaching was later coloured by Gnosticism and Manicheanism.By them the soul was regarded as light and the body as darkness; light mustirradiate the body and eventually be liberated from the body. St. Gregory in the4th century emphasised the triplicate of body, soul and spirit as did St. Paul.He summed up in his teaching the point of view of the best thinkers of his time,and (quoting Dr. Hollander) taught that:“... the Soul has no parts, yet Gregory distinguished nutritive, sensitive, andrational faculties, corresponding to the body, soul and spirit. The rationalnature is not equally present in all parts of the body. The higher nature usesthe lower as its vehicle. In matter resides the vital power; in the vital dwellssensitive power, and to the sensitive power is united the rational. Thesensitive soul is thus a medium, purer than flesh and grosser than the rationalsoul. The soul thus [78] united with the body is the real source of allactivities.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D., In Search of the Soul, Vol. I, p. 88)From the 5th century on to the 17th we have the ideas of various schools; ofScholastics, of Arabian philosophers, of Kabbalists, also the philosophers ofthe Middle Ages, and that notable group of men who brought about the Reformationand Renaissance. They discussed the various theories accounting for the soul,but not much progress was made, for all was gradually tending towards theemergence of modern science, the establishment of modern medicine, and therevelations of the age of electricity. Gradually the form aspect of nature andthe laws governing natural phenomena engrossed attention, until speculations asto the soul and its nature were increasingly relegated to the theologians.In the 17th century, Stahl wrote fully upon the subject of the soul andsummarised a great deal of the teaching extant in his time. This has been termedthe Theory of Animism. It is the doctrine that the soul is the vital principle,and responsible for all organic development. We speak of the animism of thelittle evolved races, who personified and worshipped the forces of nature; werecognise the animism outlined by Stahl in the later cycles of our own time ashaving been always present; we study the modern scientists’ teaching as toforce, as to energy, as to the atom, and we find that we are [79] confronted bya world of energies which cannot be negated. We live in a universe animated byforces. Speed, activity, vitality, transportation, the transmission of sound,electrical energy, and many such phrases are the catch-words of today. We speakand think in terms of force.Stahl summed up the teaching in the following terms:“The body is made for the soul; the soul is not made for, and is not the productof, the body.... The source of all vital movement is the soul, which builds upthe machine of the body, and maintains it for a time against externalinfluences.... The immediate cause of death is not disease, but the directaction of the soul, which leaves the bodily machine, either because it hasbecome unworkable through some serious lesion or because it does not choose towork it any longer.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D., In Search of the Soul, Vol. I,p.169.)Berkeley’s definition of the soul is interesting, for he defines it as a simple,active being, revealed to us through experience.The modern materialistic psychology which regards the soul as the product ofbrain activity is perhaps not entirely wrong but is dealing with a secondarydemonstration of the vital soul.Dr. Müller-Freienfels says:“... we must not regard the body as an atomistic mechanism but rather as thevehicle of a comprehensive vital energy; whereupon the ‘body’ ceases to bemerely matter and is conceived of as being ‘animated’.”[80] He goes on to say also:“And now at last we see a possibility of arriving at a conception of the soul!Let us remember how mankind came to form this conception. Not in order toexplain the ‘consciousness’ (for the ‘soul’ can exist without consciousness),but in order to make comprehensible that complex continuity of activities whichwe call life, mankind created the conception of the soul. We have alreadystressed the fact that in all primitive cultures the ‘soul’ is by no meansidentical with the consciousness, and that this equivalence is a latephilosophical reservation. As a matter of fact, what primitive man understandsby ‘soul’ is what we today call ‘life.’ ‘Animated’ and ‘alive’ are, asconceptions, completely identical, just as the conceptions ‘inanimate’ and‘dead’ are identical. The Greek word psyche does not by any means signify merelyconsciousness, but can usually be translated simply by ‘life,’ and similarly, inmany cases the German words Leben and Seele , as the English words ‘life’ and‘soul,’ are interchangeable....“In this, however, we are at one with both the main tendencies of recentphilosophy. Even the later materialists had come to admit that the soul is not asubstance, but that the psychical processes occur in substance, and theytherefore regarded it as equivalent to ‘motion.’ On the other hand, theconscientialists also regarded psychical processes as ‘events’ which they hadsomehow to bring into relation with physical movements.“We accept both these notions. What we call ‘soul’ is neither an extended‘substance’ nor a thinking ‘substance’; it is not a ‘substance’ at all, but ahighly complicated event, a continuity of effects, which reveals itself on theone hand in the building up of the body, and on the other in the consciousness.[81]“Nevertheless, this doctrine of ours, which does not divide the universe intosubstance and consciousness, but places a connecting-link between the two, whichon the one hand reveals itself materially, but is also the hypothesis of theconsciousness, differs from both materialism and conscientialism in this, thatit does not conceive of the soul as existing in substance alone nor yet inconsciousness alone. On the contrary, both consciousness and body appear to usonly as effect of a third thing which comprehends them both, producing theconsciousness and also giving form to the raw material. We have already seenthat the consciousness must necessarily demand such a profounder ‘being,’whereas the materialistic theory demands a formative ‘power,’ which forms thebody and with it the soul. One might call this theory ‘monistic,’ though itavoids one-sidedness just as it avoids dualism, only that the conception hasbeen overworked, and both the consciential theory and the materialistic theoryare—though, after all, incorrectly—described as monistic. We call the theorytowards which we are working the dynamistic theory, because it represents thenature of the soul as directed force; and we may also call it vitalistic,because this force, which gives the body form and engenders the consciousness,proves to be identical with life.” (Richard Müller-Freienfels, Mysteries of theSoul, pp. 40, 41, 42.)We get a hint of the relation between these three, spirit, soul and body, in thewords of The Secret Doctrine.“Life we look upon as the One Form of Existence, manifesting in what is calledMatter; or what, incorrectly separating them, we name Spirit, Soul and Matter inman. Matter is the Vehicle for the manifestation [82] of Soul on this plane ofexistence, and Soul is the Vehicle on a higher plane for the manifestation ofSpirit, and these three are a Trinity synthesized by Life, which pervades themall.” (H.P. Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine, Vol. I, pp. 79, 80.)The soul, the self are synonymous terms in Oriental literature. The maintreatise upon the Soul, its nature, purpose and mode of existence, is that mostfamous of all the Eastern Scriptures, the Bhagavad Gita . Deussen summarises theteaching as to the Atma, the self or soul, as follows:“If for our present purpose we hold fast to this distinction of the Brahman asthe cosmical principle of the universe, the atman as the psychical, thefundamental thought of the entire Upanishad philosophy may be expressed by thesimple equation:Brahman = AtmanThis is to say—the Brahman, the power which presents itself to us materializedin all existing things, which creates, sustains, preserves, and receives backinto itself again all worlds, this eternal infinite divine power is identicalwith the atman, with that which, after stripping off everything external, wediscover in ourselves as our real most essential being, our individual self, thesoul. This identity of the Brahman and the atman, of God and the soul, is thefundamental thought of the entire doctrine of the Upanishads....“The atman is, as has often already been pointed out, an idea capable of verydifferent interpretations. The word signifies no more than ‘the self,’ and thequestion then arises what we regard as our self. Three positions are herepossible, according as by the atman is [83] understood (1) the corporeal self,the body; (2) the individual soul, free from the body, which as knowing subjectis contrasted with and distinct from the object; or (3) the supreme soul, inwhich subject and object are no longer distinguished from one another, or which,according to the Indian conception, is the objectless knowing subject.” (PaulDeussen, M.D., The Religion and Philosophy of India. pp. 39, 94.)An Oriental writer comments as follows:“All organic beings have a principle of self-determination, to which the name of‘soul’ is generally given. In the strict sense of the word, ‘soul’ belongs toevery being that has life in it, and the different souls are fundamentallyidentical in nature. The differences are due to the physical organizations thatobscure and thwart the life of the soul. The nature of the bodies in which thesouls are incorporated accounts for their various degrees of obscuration.“Each buddhi, with its grasp of senses and the like, is an isolated organismdetermined by its past karma, and has its own peculiarly associated ignorance(avidya). The ego is the psychological unity of that stream of consciousexperiencing which constitutes what we know as the inner life of an empiricalself.“The Empirical Self is the mixture of free spirit and mechanism, of purusa andprakriti.... Every ego possesses within the gross material body, which suffersdissolution at death, a subtle body, formed of the psychical apparatus,including the senses.” (S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy, Vol. II, pp. 279,283, 284, 285.)An Indian scripture sums up this teaching as follows: [84]“So there are four Atmas—the life, the mind, the soul, the spirit. The ultimateforce which lies at the root of macrocosmic power of the manifestations of soul,mind, and the life-principle, is the spirit.” (Rama Prasad, Nature's FinerForces, p. 121. [Quoted from the Prashnopanishad.])All, therefore, appears to be an expression of the life force, and we begin toapproach the truth as formulated in the East, that matter is spirit or energy inits lowest manifestation, and spirit is matter in its highest expression. Inbetween these two extremes, and thus manifesting in time and space, come thosediversities of the manifested life-consciousness which engross the interest ofthe religious man, the psychologist, the scientist, and the philosopher,according to their peculiar predilections and tendencies. All are studying thevarying aspect of the one animating life.The differentiations, the terminologies, and the tabulations in connection withthese various approaches to truth are the cause of much of the confusion. We areengaged in separating a unified Reality into parts, and in so doing we lose oursense of proportion and over-emphasise that particular part which we happentemporarily to be dissecting. But the whole remains intact, and our realisationof this Reality grows as we become inclusive in our consciousness andparticipate in a veritable experience.The testimony to this experience can be traced from the very night of time. Fromthe emergence [85] of the human family in the unfolding evolutionary developmentof the world plan there has been a paralleling progressive development of theGod idea to account for nature and the soul idea to account for man. Ananthology of the soul remains as yet to be compiled, the very magnitude of thetask probably serving as a deterrent.Speculation has always been rife as to where the soul was to be found, andwhere, within the human form, it might be located. A few of the theoriespropounded might be touched upon here.Plato held that the vital principle was in the brain and that brain and spinalcord were coordinators of vital force, whilstStrato placed it in the forepart of the brain, between the eyebrows.Hippocrates placed the consciousness or soul in the brain andHerophilus made the calamus scriptorius the chief seat of the soul.Erasistratos located the soul in the cerebellum, or the little brain, and statedthat it was concerned in the coordination of movement.Galen , the great forerunner of modern medical methods, argued for the fourthventricle of the brain as the home of the soul in man.Hippolytus (3rd century A.D.) says: “The membranes in the head are gently movedby the spirit which advances toward the pineal gland. Near this is situated theentrance to the cerebellum which admits the current of spirit and distributes[86] it into the spinal column. This cerebellum by an ineffable and inscrutableprocess attracts through the pineal gland the spiritual and life givingsubstance.”St. Augustine regarded the soul as located in the middle ventricle.The Arabian philosophers , who so strongly moulded thought in the Middle Ages,identified the ventricles of the brain as the seat of the soul or consciouslife.Dr. Hollander tells us that:“The reason why the ancient philosophers, from whom the Arabs adopted thislocalization, placed the faculties in certain cells, meaning cavities orventricles, probably was to give more room for the pneuma, the gaseoussubstance, to expand.... Some distinguished four regions, as follows: The firstor anterior ventricle of the brain, which was supposed to look towards thefront, was the ventricle of common sense; because from it the nerves of the fiveouter senses were presumed to branch off, and into it, by the aid of thesenerves, all sensations were brought together. The second ventricle, connected bya minute opening with the first, was fixed upon as the seat of the imaginativefaculty, because the impressions from the five outer senses are transmitted fromthe first ventricle into it, as a second stage in their progress through thebrain. The third ventricle was the seat of the understanding; and the fourth wassacred to memory, because it was commodiously situated as a storehouse intowhich the conceptions of the mind, digested in the second ventricle, might betransmitted for attention and accumulation. As a matter of fact, the so-calledanterior ventricle consists of two ventricles: the right and left lateral [87]ventricles, which communicate with one another and are continuous with the thirdventricle—called in ancient times the middle ventricle—by the Foramen of Monro;and the third ventricle communicates with the fourth ventricle—called by theancients the posterior ventricle—by the Aqueduct of Sylvius.“The lateral ventricles are roofed over by the corpus callosum; the third iscovered by the optic thalamus; and the fourth is situated between cerebellum andpons.... If the sense of sight and sense of hearing are stimulated at the sametime, their effects somehow cohere in consciousness, and the knowledge of thisfact inspired the hypothesis of a sensory centre to which the term sensoriumcommune or common sense was applied. By some this was regarded as the seat ofthe soul. As parts of the brain are double, the localities to be selected werevery limited, and only structures in the middle line could be chosen; as, forexample, the pineal gland by Descartes and, as late as the nineteenth century,the optic thalamus by W.B. Carpenter, and the pons cerebri by Herbert Spencer.”(Bernard Hollander, M.D., In Search of the Soul, Vol. I, p. 97.)Roger Bacon regarded the centre of the brain as the place where the soul couldbe found.Ludovico Vives “regarded the soul as the principle, not only of conscious life,but of life in general; the heart is the centre of its vital or vegetativeactivity, the brain of its intellectual activity.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D., InSearch of the Soul, Vol. I, p. 119)Mundinus , a famous anatomist of the Middle Ages, believed firmly in “animalspirits.” He taught that these animal spirits passed into the third ventricle bya narrow passage. He also [88] taught that the cellules of the brain are theseat of the intellect.Vesalius , the first to discern the difference between the grey and white matterof the brain and to describe the five ventricles, “distinguished three souls ...and he assigned to the brain the chief soul, the sum of the animal spirits,whose functions were distinctly mental.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D., In Search ofthe Soul, Vol. I, p. 186.)Servetus located the soul in the Aqueduct of Sylvius, the channel connecting thethird and fourth ventricle of the brain.Telesio in De Rerum Natura “taught that the soul was the subtlest form ofmatter, a very delicate substance, enclosed within the nervous system andtherefore eluding our senses. Its seat is chiefly the brain, but it extends alsoto the spinal cord, the nerves, arteries, veins, and the covering membranes ofthe internal organs.... Recognizing that the nervous system is in closeconnection with soul-life, he acknowledged that the soul in man differs only indegree from the soul in animals. He assumed beside the material soul in man, adivine non-corporeal soul directly implanted by God, which united with thematerial soul.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D., In Search of the Soul, Vol. I, p.132.)Willis ascribed the various faculties of the soul, such as mentality, vitality,memory, etc., to different parts of the brain.Vieussens located the soul in the centrum ovale.Swedenborg says: “The royal road of the sensations [89] of the body to the soul... is through the corpora striata.... All determinations of the will alsodescend by that road.... It is the Mercury of Olympus; it announces to the soulwhat is happening to the body, and it bears the mandates of the soul to thebody.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D., In Search of the Soul, Vol. I, p. 186.)The corpora striata are a pair of large ganglia of the brain immediately underthe anterior and superior region of the brain.Hollis concluded that “both sensation and movement have their power in themedulla of the brain. This therefore is the seat of the soul,” andCharles Bonnet said: “The different senses ... with which we are endowed ...have, somewhere, in the brain, secret communications by means of which they mayact on one another. The part where the communications take place is that whichmust be regarded as the seat of the soul.... It is by this part that the soulacts on the body, and by the body on so many different beings. Now the soul actsonly by the agency of the nerves.” (Bernard Hollander, M.D. In Search of theSoul, Vol. I, p. 190.)von Sommering localized the seat of the soul in the fluid of the cerebralventricles, whilstW. B. Carpenter , the physiologist, regarded the optic thalamus as the seat ofthe soul life. (The speculations of these various writers have been taken fromDr. Hollander's work quoted above.)However, from the time of Francis Joseph Gall, the great animist and physicianand the founder of the Science of Phrenology, emphasis is no longer [90] laid onthe probable location of the soul. The mind has emerged into the limelight;character, ethics and what has been called the Science of Ethology has come intobeing. The relation of psychical qualities to the brain has become the subjectof consideration, and today we have included the glands in our speculation andso carried the idea forward. The modern mechanistic teachings of psychology havetemporarily taken the place of the older vitalistic, animistic, and mysticalideas. The materialistic approach, however, has been of profound value. It hasbrought about two things among many others: It has preserved the balance, firstof all, and produced a structure of knowledge, based on natural facts, which hasoff-set the errors and deductions of the visionary mystic and the superstitionsof the religious theologians. Secondly, by means of the conclusions arrived atthrough the work of the modern psychologists, through the study of the mind, andof its power, and through the influence of such organisations as ChristianScience and New Thought, a bridge has been constructed between the East and theWest. It is now possible for the Oriental teaching as to the triplicity of soul,mind and brain, to be appreciated and understood. After eliminating certainundesirable features (and there are several) and in collaboration with Westernscience, light again may stream forth from the East and point the way forhumanity into a new state of being, into a fuller realisation of power, and intoa truer appreciation [91] of the nature of the human soul. Then perhaps we shallappreciate the truth of Browning’s conception of this integrated human being:“Three souls which make up one soul; first, to wit,A soul of each and all the bodily parts,Seated therein, which works, and is what Does,And has the use of earth, and ends the manDownward: but, tending upward for advice,Grows into, and again is grown intoBy the next soul, which, seated in the brain,Useth the first with its collected use,And feeleth, thinketh, willeth—is what Knows:Which, duly tending upward in its turn,Grows into, and again is grown intoBy the last soul, that uses both the first,Subsisting whether they assist or no,And, constituting man’s self, is what Is—And leans upon the former, makes it play,As that played off the first; and, tending up,Holds, is upheld by, God, and ends the manUpward in that dread point of intercourse,Nor needs a place, for it returns to Him.What Does, what Knows, what Is; three souls, one man.”(Robert Browning, A Death in the Desert.)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V — ORIENTAL TEACHING AS TO THE SOUL, ETHER AND ENERGY“As from its fineness, the all-pervading ether is not touched, so the soul,located in every body, is not touched.“As the one Sun illumines all this world so He that abideth in the body lightsup the whole field.“They, who with the eye of Wisdom perceive the distinction between the field andthe Knower of the field, and the liberation of being from nature, go to theSupreme.” (Bhagavad Gita, XIII, pp. 32, 33, 34.)[92] The literature of the East dealing with the soul and its expression, theetheric or vital body, on the physical plane is immense as a study of the veryincomplete bibliography will show. Scattered throughout the Upanishads and thePuranas are thousands of passages dealing with this teaching. Two of the mostimportant sources of information are the Shiv-Samhita and the ShatchakraNirupanam .Sir John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon) has done much, through his books, to bring aknowledge of this Eastern teaching and of this technique of soul development tothe West; he has, through the form in which he has presented it, safeguarded thepublic also from a too quick comprehension of a most [93] dangerous science. Alittle book by a Hindu physician, well grounded in Western medicine and science,entitled The Mysterious Kundalini (Vasant G. Rele) is of real value also.The danger of this science is well recognised by those who know anything aboutit. It lies in the fact that through a knowledge of a certain technical methodit becomes possible for a man to work actively with the forces of his ownnature, as they function through the medium of the vital body. Modern physiciansare recognising increasingly the energy factor in connection with man. Theelectrical nature of the human unit is a natural out-growth of a necessaryrecognition that the physical body is formed of atoms, as are all forms in thenatural world.The Occidental scientist recognises ether and motion. The Oriental teacherspeaks of the akasha and of prana. Both are dealing with the vital livingnesswhich permeates all forms, and is the cause of their coherency, sentiency, andterms of existence. The following passage from the Kenopanishad willsubstantiate this.“Unmanifested, formless, the one giver of light, is the Great Power; from thatappeared the sonoriferous ether (Akasha); from that had birth the tangiferousether.“From the tangiferous ether, the luminiferous ether, and from this thegustiferous ether; thence was the birth of the odoriferous ether. These are thefive ethers and they have fivefold extension. [94]“From these the universe came forth; by these it continues; into these itdisappears; among these also it shows itself again.” (Kenopanishad—Quoted byRama Prasad in Nature's Finer Forces, pp. 187-188.)A resemblance between the luminiferous ether of the ancient Indian scriptures,and the light waves of the modern scientist is obvious. Rama Prasad in anamazingly interesting book called Nature’s Finer Forces lists four states ofsubtle matter:1. Prana or life matter2. Psychic matter3. Mental matter4. Spiritual matterand it becomes apparent that these four are qualities of the energies which usethe Akasha as their medium of expression. A study of the Oriental books gives usa picture of a material world which is brought into being and animated by asubjective world of forces, which use the ether (Akasha) as their playground,and are responsible for all forms, qualities and differentiations in thephenomenal world.The following extracts from The Serpent Power give the Oriental teaching aboutmatter and ether.“Recent scientific research has shown that this original substance cannot bescientific ‘matter’—that is, that which has mass, weight, and inertia. Matterhas been dematerialised and reduced, according to current hypotheses, [95] tosomething which differs profoundly from ‘matter’ as known by the senses. Thisultimate substance is stated to be Ether in a state of motion. The presentscientific hypothesis would appear to be as follows. There is no such thing asscientific ‘Matter.’ If there seems to be such, this is due to the action ofShakti as Maya. The ultimate and simplest physical factor from which theuniverse has arisen is motion of and in a substance, called ‘ether,’ which isnot scientific ‘matter.’ The motions of this substance give rise from therealistic point of view to the notion of ‘matter.’ Matter is thus at base one,notwithstanding the diversity of its forms. Its ultimate element is on the finalanalysis of one kind, and the differences in the various kinds of matter dependon the various movements of the ultimate particle and its succeedingcombinations. Given such unity of base, it is possible that one form of mattermay pass into another.” (Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), The Serpent Power,p. 89.)In another book Arthur Avalon says:“In the first place, it is now admitted that ‘matter,’ even with the addition ofall possible forces, is insufficient to explain many phenomena, such as those oflight; and it has, accordingly, come to be an article of scientific faith thatthere is a substance called ‘Ether’; a medium which, filling the universe,transports by its vibrations the radiations of light, heat, electricity, andperhaps action from a distance, such as the attraction exercised betweenheavenly bodies. It is said, however, that this Ether is not ‘matter,’ butdiffers profoundly from it, and that it is only our infirmity of knowledge whichobliges us, in our attempted description of it, to borrow comparisons from‘matter’ in its ordinary physical sense, which alone is known by our senses. Butif we assume the existence of Ether, we know that [96] ‘material’ bodiesimmersed in it can change their places therein. In fact, to use an Indianexpression, the characteristic property of the vibrations of the Akasha Tattvais to make the space in which the other Tattvas and their derivatives exist.With ‘Matter’ and Ether as its materials, Western purely ‘scientific’ theorieshave sought to construct the world.” (Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), Shaktiand Shakta, p. 167.)“Many people were wont, as some still are, to laugh at the idea of Maya. Was notmatter solid, permanent and real enough? But according to science what are we(as physical beings) at base? The answer is, infinitely tenuous formless energywhich materialises into relatively stable, yet essentially transitory, forms....The process by which the subtle becomes gradually more and more gross continuesuntil it develops into what a friend of mine calls the ‘crust’ of solid matter(Parthivabhuta ). This whilst it lasts is tangible enough. But it will not lastfor ever and in some radio-active substances dissociates before our eyes.”(Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe) Shakti and Shakta, p. 170.)Vivekananda, who did so much to reveal the soul of India to the West, says:“According to the philosophers of India, the whole universe is composed of twomaterials, one of which they call Akasa . It is the omnipresent all penetratingexistence. Everything that has form, everything that is the result of thecompounds, is evolved out of this Akasa . It is the Akasa that becomes the air,that becomes the liquids, that becomes the solids; it is the Akasa that becomesthe sun, the earth, the moon, the stars, the comets; it is the Akasa thatbecomes the body, the animal body, the planets, every form that we see,everything that can be sensed, everything that exists. It itself cannot beperceived; it is so subtle that [97] it is beyond all ordinary perception; itcan only be seen when it has become gross, has taken form. At the beginning ofcreation there is only this Akasa ; at the end of the cycle the solids, theliquids, and the gases all melt into the Akasa again, and the next creationsimilarly proceeds out of this Akasa .“By what power is this Akasa manufactured into this universe? By the power ofPrana. Just as Akasa is the infinite omnipresent material of this universe, sois this Prana the infinite omnipresent manifesting power of this universe. Atthe beginning and at the end of a cycle everything becomes Akasa , and all theforces that are in the universe resolve back into the Prana ; in the next cycle,out of this Prana , is evolved everything that we call energy, everything thatwe call force. It is the Prana that is manifesting as motion; it is the Pranathat is manifesting as gravitation, as magnetism. It is the Prana that ismanifesting as the actions of the body, as the nerve currents, as thought force.From thought, down to the lowest physical force, everything is but themanifestation of Prana . The sum-total of all force in the universe, mental orphysical, when resolved back to its original state, is called Prana ...” (SwamiVivekananda, Raja Yoga, pp. 29, 30.)A more modern writer, Ramacharaka, says:“In order to avoid misconceptions arising from the various theories regardingthis great principle, which theories are usually attached to some name given theprinciple, we, in this work, will speak of the principle as ‘Prana,’ this wordbeing the Sanscrit term meaning ‘Absolute Energy.’ Many occult authorities teachthat the principle which the Hindus term ‘Prana’ is the universal principle ofenergy or force, and that all energy or force is derived from that principle,or, rather, [98] is a particular form of manifestation of that principle.... Wemay consider it as the active principle of life—Vital Force, if you please. Itis found in all forms of life, from the amoeba to man—from the most elementaryform of plant life to the highest form of animal life. ‘Prana’ is all pervading.It is found in all things having life, and as the occult philosophy teaches thatlife is in all things—in every Atom—the apparent lifelessness of some thingsbeing only a lesser degree of manifestation, we may understand their teachingsthat ‘Prana’ is everywhere, in everything. ‘Prana’ must not be confounded withthe Ego—that bit of Divine Spirit in every soul, around which clusters matterand energy. ‘Prana’ is merely a form of energy used by the Ego in its materialmanifestation. When the Ego leaves the body, the ‘Prana,’ being no longer underits control, responds only to the order of the individual atoms, or groups ofatoms, forming the body, and as the body disintegrates and is resolved to itsoriginal elements, each atom takes with it sufficient ‘Prana’ to enable it toform new combinations, the unused ‘Prana’ returning to the great universalstorehouse from which it came. With the Ego in control, cohesion exists and theatoms are held together by the Will of the Ego.“‘Prana’ is the name by which we designate a universal principle, whichprinciple is the essence of all motion, force or energy, whether manifested ingravitation, electricity, the revolution of the planets, and all forms of life,from the highest to the lowest. It may be called the soul of Force and Energy inall their forms, and that principle which, operating in a certain way, causesthat form of activity which accompanies life.” (Yogi Ramacharaka, The Hindu-YogiScience of Breath, pp. 16, 17.)This prana is therefore the universal life principle in all forms, and theso-called energies or [99] life of the human body are the differentiated quotaof that universal principle which any particular human soul has appropriated.The energies which utilise the akasha (ether) in the universe are divided intothree main divisions according to the Ageless Wisdom.1. Fohat, is analogous to what the Christian regards as the spirit; it is thewill-to-exist, the determining life principle of God, Who, we can predicate, isthe sum total of all forms, and of all states of consciousness; it is divinePurpose, actively functioning.2. Prana, is analogous to the activity of the consciousness principle, the Soulof the Christian. This prana is an effect of the union of spirit or life, andmatter or substance, and demonstrates as the energy of the form, as it producescohesion, animation and sensitivity, carrying out divine purpose.3. Kundalini , as it is called in connection with the human form, is the forcelatent in matter itself; it is the integral life of the atom, apart from anyform in which that atom may participate in its tiny cycle of experience.Shakti is power or energy. Arthur Avalon defines it as follows:“What then is Shakti and how does it come about that there is some principle ofunconsciousness in things; a fact which cannot be denied. Shakti comes from theroot ‘shak’ ‘to be able,’ ‘to have power.’ It [100] may be applied to any formof activity. The power to burn is Shakti of fire and so forth. These are allforms of activity which are ultimately reducible to the Primordial Shakti (AdyaShakti) whence every other form of Power proceeds.” (Sir John Woodroffe (ArthurAvalon), Shakti and Shakta, p. 207.)These three types of energy are therefore aspects of the one universal life, asit expresses itself through a solar system, utilising the ether as its medium orfield of activity, and producing therefrom all the objective forms. The processrepeats itself in man, according to the Hindu philosophy.The physical body is the expression in its component parts or atoms of the thirdtype of energy, and the sum-total of that atomic energy is called Kundalini:“The centre where all residual sensations are, as it were, stored up is calledMul-adhara chakra, and the coiled up energy of action is Kundalini, ‘the coiledup’.”“It is the individual bodily representative of the great cosmic power (Shakti)which created and sustains the universe.” (Vasant G. Rele, The MysteriousKundalini, p. 40.)The physical body itself is often regarded as an atom in the body of the humankingdom, and in this case the Kundalini energy, localised as it is supposed tobe in a centre at the base of the spine, would be a positive nucleus, with theother atoms of the body regarded as electronic in nature.The vital body, or body of ether, is the medium [101] for the expression of thelife soul, that sentient vivifying duality which we call prana. This dual energyhas two positive centres in the vital body and consequently in the physical—onein the heart, where feeling and sentiency are claimed to be centred, and anotherin the head where the mind and the spiritual consciousness find expression.Dr. Rele says that “Prana proper is located between the larynx and the base ofthe heart.”“The heart more than the head occupies the attention of the thinkers of theUpanishads. It is there that the vital breaths reside. Not only the five pranas,but also eye, ear, speech, and manas originate from the heart. The heart and notthe head is the home of manas; and the former therefore is the centre also ofconscious life. In sleep the organs of the soul remain in the heart, and therealso they gather at death; ‘through the heart we recognize forms,’ through theheart we recognize faith, beget children, know the truth, on it speech also isbased, while the further question on what the heart is based is angrilyrejected. Not the organs however alone, but all beings are based upon andsupported by the heart; and even setting aside the actual definition of theheart as Brahman, it is yet the empirical home of the soul, and therefore ofBrahman—’here within the heart is a cavity, wherein he resides, the lord of theuniverse, the ruler of the universe, the chief of the universe.’ The heart iscalled hridayam, because ‘it is he’ who dwells ‘in the heart’ (hridi ayam,Chand. 8.3.3.), small as a grain of rice or barley; an inch in height thepurusha dwells in the midst of the body, as the self of created things in theheart.” (Dr. Paul Deussen, The Philosophy of the Upanishads, pp. 286, 287.)[102]“Similarly numerous passages in the later Upanishads celebrate Brahman as‘implanted in the cavity of the heart.’ The identity of the atman in us with theatman of the universe is expressed by the tat tvam asi of Chand. 6.8-16, andalso by the etad vai tad , ‘in truth this is that,’ of Brih. 5.4, which isprobably an imitation of the other. The same formula is found twelve times inKath. 4.3-6.1, in a prose passage appended to the verses. The highest bliss,according to Kath. 5.14, consists in the consciousness of this thought. We quotein this connection only Kath. 4.12-13:“An inch in height, here in the bodyThe purusha dwells,Lord of the past and the future;He who knows him frets no more—In truth, this is that.~“Like flame without smoke, an inch in heightThe purusha is in size,Lord of the past and the future;It is he to-day and also to-morrow—In truth, this is that.”(Dr. Paul Deussen, The Philosophy of the Upanishads, p. 170. 287.)As here the purusha is compared to a smokeless flame, so in imitation of thispassage, in S’vet. 6.19, it is likened to a fire whose fuel is consumed; whilein S’vet. 5.9, the contrast between the atman within us and the atman in theuniverse is pushed to an extreme:“Split a hundred times the tip of a hair,And take a hundredth part thereof;That I judge to be the size of the soul,Yet it goes to immortality.”[103] The description of the atman as a smokeless flame in the heart has beendeveloped in the Yogi Upanishads into the picture of the tongue of flame in theheart, the earliest occurrence of which is perhaps Mahan. 11.6-12.” (Dr. PaulDeussen, The Philosophy of the Upanishads, p. 171. 287.)The Scriptures are full of references to the fact that Atman, the self, is foundin the heart, from whence it expresses itself as the life principle through themedium of the blood. The soul nature, or the rational mind and theself-conscious individual, expresses itself in the head and from that positiongoverns the nervous system:“It has now been proved, that the highest centres are located in the cortex ofthe brain, where knowledge of action and sensation is manifested. These centresare both receiving i.e. sensory; and directing i.e. motor, and have theirsubsidiary centres in the two large swellings called the basal-ganglia in eachhemisphere of the brain. They are known as thalamus and corpus striatum. Thefirst one is auxiliary to the chief sensory centre and the second one auxiliaryto the chief motor centre in the cortex of the brain. Normally, the auxiliarymotor centres are more or less under the control of the will.... The Yogi isconcerned with the subsidiary nerve centres in the thalamus. The normal functionof the thalamus is to receive sensations from all parts of the body, which arerelayed to it through the spinal cord, before they reach the chief centre.As this is the highest reflex centre in the brain and as all impressions ascendto it, it is called the Udana-prana. The last relay in the cord, from which itreceives impulses, is from that portion of the cord, [104] called the Bulb,which is on a level with the root of the nose. Udana-prana is, therefore, saidto rule the portion of the head above this point.The Yogi, by a conscious control over the Udana-prana, suppresses all incomingand outgoing sensations into it, and this is necessary to prevent thedistraction of the mind which he is anxious to control.” (Vasant G. Rele, TheMysterious Kundalini, p. 70.s, p. 171. 287.)Srinivasa Iyengar makes the following postulates and states that all the schoolsof thought, except the school of crude Nihilism, accept them.1. Man is a complex of consciousness, mind and body.2. The Atma (self) is of the nature of the consciousness and is immutable.3. Mind, though an inner organ, is material, and is other than the atman.4. All energy in the universe is personal, i.e., bound up with consciousness.5. This energy is prana, which is intermediate between mind and matter.“Hindu philosophy regards Prana and not motion as the fundamental energy of thecosmos. Prana is conceived as a power coming from or started by the Purusha(Spirit aspect—A.A.B.) and acting on matter.”“All the energy of animals is nervous energy till it leaves the muscles and actson outside objects. This nervous energy is called Prana. Western Science has fora hundred years unsuccessfully tried to explain nervous energy as a form ofmechanical motion; Eastern Philosophy reverses the process and derivesmechanical [105] motion from Prana, or energy accompanied by consciousness.“Prana corresponds to the Psychikon pneuma, animal spirits, of Greek philosophy,a category which is intermediate between spirit and matter, and brings them intorelation with each other.” (P.T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Outlines of IndianPhilosophy, pp. 58. 59.)Arthur Avalon says:“Various people have in antiquity assigned to various parts of the body the‘seat of the soul’ or life, such as the blood, the heart, and the breath.Generally the brain was not so regarded. The Vaidik system posits the heart asthe chief centre of Consciousness—a relic of which notion we also still preservein such phrases as ‘take it to heart’ and to ‘learn by heart.’ Sadhaka, which isone of the five functions of Pitta, and which is situated in the heart,indirectly assists in the performance of cognitive functions by keeping up therhythmic cardiac contractions, and it has been suggested that it was perhapsthis view of the heart’s construction which predisposed Indian physiologists tohold it to be the seat of cognition. According to the Tantras, however, thechief centres of consciousness are to be found in the Chakras of thecerebro-spinal system and in the upper brain (Sahasrara), which they describe,though the heart is also recognized as a seat of the Jivatma, or embodiedspirit, in its aspect as Prana.” (Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), TheSerpent Power, p. 3)These two points of view account probably for the phenomenon of the human being.As evolution proceeds it may be found and demonstrated that the positive centreor nucleus for the life of [106] the material form is located at the base of thespine, that the positive centre for the life of the sentient conscious man is inthe heart, whilst the positive centre for the mind and the spiritual lifeprinciples is in the head.The whole scheme and technique of the Oriental teaching as to the centres in manhave in view the increasing display of prana or life-soul energy. Through anunderstanding of this a man can demonstrate (through the automaton of thephysical body) those soul powers and spiritual qualities which are theinheritance of the spiritual man, the Soul.The object, therefore, of all methods and practices is to bring about consciousunion with the soul, and produce the subordination of the two lower energies,those of matter and those of the sentient mental nature, to the highest of thethree energies, the spiritual life. When this is accomplished, the spirituallife principle animates a soul which knows no barriers and limitations becauseit has brought its mechanism to the highest state of perfection. Matter has beenraised into heaven, and hence the Hindu teaching that the Kundalini fire, theenergy of matter (sometimes called the mother) has eventually to be raised fromits position at the base of the spine up into the head. This is a correspondenceto the Roman Catholic teaching as to the Assumption of the Virgin-Mother intoHeaven to take her place by the side of her Son, the Christ, the Soul. This hasto be brought about [107] consciously by the soul or self, seated in the mindand brain consciousness, and from there assuming control of the energies of theentire natural man. This is Yoga or union, which is not only a mysticalexperience, but a vital or physical one also. This is the at-one-ment of theChristian. It is an integration of the entire man, physical, sentient, andmental, and then a conscious unification with the universal soul. Dr. Rele says:“The word ‘Yoga’ is derived from the root ‘Yuga’ to join or to weld together.Just as in welding, two pieces of the same metal are made to become one by theprocess of heating and hammering, so also in the Yoga of Indian Philosophy, theembodied spirit ‘Jivatma,’ which is a part of the universal spirit ‘Paramatma,’is made to become one with the Universal Spirit by certain physical and mentalexercises.“Yoga is the science which raises the capacity of the human mind to respond tohigher vibrations, and to perceive, catch, and assimilate the infinite consciousmovements going on around us in the universe.” (Rele Vasant G., The MysteriousKundalini, pp. 13, 14.)René Guénon sums up the result of this union in the following terms:“Deliverance or Union, which is one and the same thing, involves, as we havealready stated, ‘over and above,’ the possession of all states, since it is theperfect realization (sadhana ) and totalization of the being; it is moreover oflittle import whether these states are or are not actually manifested, since itis only as permanent and immutable possibilities that they are to bemetaphysically considered. ‘Lord of many states by [108] the simple effect ofhis will, the Yogi only concerns himself with one, leaving the others void ofthe animating breath (prana ), as so many unused instruments, he can animatemore than one form in the same way that a single lamp may supply more than onewick.’ ‘The Yogi ,’ says Aniruddha, ‘is in direct connexion with the primordialprinciple of the Universe, and in consequence (secondarily) with the whole ofspace, of time and of things,’ that is to say, with manifestation, and, moreparticularly, with the human state in all its modifications.” (Réné Guénon, Manand His Becoming, p. 238.)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI — SEVEN CENTRES OF FORCE[109] In the previous chapter we have seen that, according to the Easternteaching, the vital or etheric body is constituted of ether and acts as theconductor of prana which is the life principle and energises matter and producesform. The vital body also embodies that sentient principle in nature called thesoul, or rather the vital body is the expression and vehicle of the soul.The main characteristic of the soul is consciousness. The soul as life is“seated in the heart,” and as rational spiritual consciousness is “seated on thethrone between the eyebrows.” René Guénon expresses this as follows:“Thus, what dwells in the vital centre, from the physical point of view, isether; from the psychic point of view, it is the ‘living soul,’ and so far weare not transcending the realm of individual possibilities; but also, and aboveall, from the metaphysical point of view, it is the principal and unconditioned‘Self.’ It is, therefore, truly the ‘Universal Spirit’ (Atma ), which is, inreality, Brahma Itself, the ‘Supreme Ruler’; and thus the designation of thiscentre as Brahma-pura is found to be fully justified. But Brahma , considered inthis manner as within man (and one might consider it in like manner in relationto every state of being) is called Purusha , because It rests or dwells in theindividuality [110] ... as in a town (puri-shaya ) for pura , in its proper andliteral sense, signifies town’.” (Réné Guénon, Man and His Becoming, pp. 44,45.)The life force has seven main points of contact with the physical body, calledthe seven centres.These seven force centres transmit the life force, and are the agents of thesoul. They maintain bodily existence and produce its activity.The Dreamer in his book, says:“What then are the centres of man? They are the reflections in the respectivenuclei of the upadhi of the one Self. If we study the workings of theimpregnation of matter by Divine Energy, sometimes spoken of as the life waves,we shall see how, from the projection of the Self into the limits of objectivitycalled matter, certain qualities are imparted to matter developing into what arecalled tattvas. Each tattva has got for its ensouled life a tanmatra, or amodification of the Divine consciousness. In each tattva, therefore, we have theDivine consciousness as the central life, while the idea of resistance forms theouter wall.”“We have seen that the Self, in virtue of its power of manifestation, reflectsitself in the various upadhis, developing in them artificial centres which form,so to say, at one and the same time the nucleus of the upadhis as well as therepresentatives of the Self in the respective planes.” (The Dreamer, Studies inthe Bhagavad Gita, pp. 37, 40, 107.)The Indian name of a force centre is “chakra.” The location of the seven centresof force (with their complete Indian names) are as follows, from the headdownwards: [111]1. Head centre — sahasrara chakra2. Centre between eyebrows — ajna chakra3. Throat centre — vishuddha chakra4. Heart or cardiac centre — anahata chakra5. Solar plexus centre — manipura chakra6. Sacral or sexual centre — svadhisthana chakra7. Centre at base of spine — muladhara chakraIt will be noted that there are four centres above the diaphragm and threebelow.Much has been written and more could be said, about these force centres orchakras, but the following will serve as an introductory summary.The force centres carry pranic energy for every part of the body and are inclose relation to the nervous system in its three divisions, namely: thecerebro-spinal, sympathetic and peripheral.From the force centres the vital or pranic energy is distributed along subtlelines of direction. These lines are called “nadis” and are closely related tothe nerves and at the same time to the arteries; they apparently underlie thecorporeal nervous system. In Man and His Becoming we read:“As regards the nadis or arteries of the subtle form, they must not beconfounded with the corporeal arteries through which the circulation of theblood is effected, and, physiologically, they correspond rather to theramifications of the nervous system, for they are [112] expressly described asluminous; but as fire is in some sort polarized into heat and light, the subtlestate is linked to the corporeal state in two different and complementary ways,by the blood as to the caloric quality, and by the nervous system as to theluminous quality. However, it must be clearly understood that, between the nadisand the nerves, there is still only a simple correspondence and not anidentification, since the former are not corporeal, and that we are dealing inreality with two different realms in the integral individuality. Similarly, whena relation is affirmed between the function of these nadis and respiration,because this is essential to the maintenance of life and corresponds truly withthe principal vital activity, it must by no means be concluded on this accountthat they can be conceived as a kind of channel in which the air circulates;this would be to confuse the ‘vital breath’ (prana ), which properly belongs tothe subtle manifestation, with a corporeal element.It is stated that the total number of nadis is seventy-two thousand; accordingto other texts, however, it should be seven hundred and twenty millions; but thedifference here is more apparent than real, since, as always holds good in suchcases, these numbers must be taken symbolically, not literally.” (René Guénon,Man and His Becoming, pp. 136, 137.)Rama Prasad, who uses the Indian word lotus for chakra or force centre, makes aninteresting comment in this connection:“The nervous plexuses of the modern anatomists coincide with these centres. Fromwhat has been said above it will appear that the centres are constituted bybloodvessels. But the only difference between the nerves and the bloodvessels isthe difference between [113] the vehicles of the positive and negative Pranas.The nerves are the positive, the bloodvessels the negative system of the body.Wherever there are nerves there are corresponding bloodvessels. Both of them areindiscriminately called Nadis. One set has for its centre the lotus of theHeart, the other the thousand-petalled lotus of the brain. The system ofbloodvessels is an exact picture of the nervous system, is, in fact, only itsshadow. Like the heart, the brain has its upper and lower divisions—the cerebrumand the cerebellum—and, as well, its right and left divisions.” (Rama Prasad,Nature's Finer Forces, pp. 45-46)The force centres are situated up the spinal column and in the head. ArthurAvalon says:“A description of the Chakras involves, in the first place, an account of theWestern anatomy and physiology of the central and sympathetic nervous systems;secondly, an account of the Tantrik nervous system and Chakras; and, lastly, thecorrelation, so far as that is possible, of the two systems on the anatomicaland physiological side, for the rest is in general peculiar to TantrikOccultism.The Tantrik theory regarding the Chakras and Sahasrara is concerned on thephysiological side ... with the central spinal system, comprising the brain orencephalon, contained within the skull, and the spinal cord, contained withinthe vertebral column (Merudanda). It is to be noted that, just as there are fivecentres (Chakras) hereinafter described, the vertebral column itself is dividedinto five regions, which, commencing from the lowest, are the coccygeal,consisting of four imperfect vertebrae, often united together into one bonecalled the coccyx; the sacral region, consisting of five vertebrae unitedtogether to form a single [114] bone, the sacrum; the lumbar region, or regionof the loins, consisting of five vertebrae; the dorsal region, or region of theback, consisting of twelve vertebrae; and the cervical region, or region of theneck, consisting of seven vertebrae. As exhibited by segments, the cord showsdifferent characteristics in different regions. Roughly speaking thesecorrespond to the regions which are assigned to the governing control of theMuladhara, Svadhishthana, Manipura, Anahata, and Vishuddha centres, or Chakras.(These regions are the base of the spine, sacral centre, solar plexus centre,heart centre and throat centre.) The central system has relation with theperiphery through the thirty-one spinal and twelve cranial nerves, which areboth afferent and efferent or sensory and motor, arousing sensation orstimulating action. Of the cranial nerves, the last six arise from the spinalbulb (medulla), and the other six, except the olfactory and optic nerves, fromthe parts of the brain just in front of the bulb. Writers of the Yoga and Tantraschools use the term Nadi, by preference, for nerves. They also, it has beensaid, mean cranial nerves when they speak of Shiras, never using the latter forarteries, as is done in the medical literature. It must, however, be noted thatthe Yoga Nadis are not the ordinary material nerves, but subtler lines ofdirection along which the vital forces go. The spinal nerves, after their exitfrom the inter-vertebral foramina, enter into communication with the gangliatedcords of the sympathetic nervous system which lie on each side of the vertebralcolumn. The spinal cord extends in the case of man from the upper border of theatlas, below the cerebellum, passing into the medulla, and finally opening intothe fourth ventricle of the brain, and descends to the second lumbar vertebra,where it tapers to a point, called the filum terminale.” (Arthur Avalon, TheSerpent Power, pp. 123-125.)[115] As the foregoing quotation refers to the Tantrik system, it should benoted that reference is made to an Indian system of energy control safe only forthose of the highest moral character and purity of life and thought. Certaindegraded practices and schools, occurring both in the East and the West,teaching so-called Tantrik practices cannot be too severely condemned.These force centres are not merely situated up the spinal column and in the headas we have just shown, but they are related to one another through the medium ofthe spinal column—a relationship too intricate to be detailed here.Of the seven centres, two are in the head and five in the spinal column. The twocentres in the head have a direct relation to the faculties of mind and motion.The sahasrara centre (head centre) called usually the thousand-petalled lotus,is the embodiment of spiritual energy, demonstrating as Will, as the abstract orspiritual mind, and as the intuition. The ajna centre, or the centre between theeyebrows, concerns the lower mind and psychic nature of that integrated organismwe call man, the personality.The five centres in the spinal column concern the varying activities of theorganism as the man demonstrates his animal instinct, his emotional reactionsand his life intention. They are largely directed by the force pouring into andissuing from the head centres.In The Serpent Power it is stated that: [116]“The centres influence not only the muscular combinations concerned involitional movements, but also the functions of vascular innervation, secretion,and the like, which have their proximate centres in the spinal cord. Thecerebral centres are said, however, to control these functions only in relationwith the manifestations of volition, feeling, and emotion; whereas the spinalcentres with the subordinate sympathetic system are said to constitute themechanism of unconscious adaptation, in accordance with the varying conditionsof stimuli which are essential to the continued existence of the organism. TheMedulla, again, is also both a path of communication between the higher centresand the periphery and an independent centre regulating functions of the greatestimportance in the system. It is to be noted that the nerve fibres which carrymotor impulses descending from the brain to the spinal cord cross over rathersuddenly from one side to the other on their way through the spinal bulb(medulla), a fact which has been noted in the Tantras in the description of theMukta Triveni. The latter is connected by numerous afferent and efferent tractswith the cerebellum and cerebral ganglia. Above the cerebellum is the cerebrum,the activity of which is ordinarily associated with conscious volition andideation and the origination of voluntary movements. The notion ofConsciousness, which is the introspective subject-matter of psychology, mustnot, however, be confused with that of physiological function. There istherefore no organ of consciousness, simply because ‘Consciousness’ is not anorganic conception, and has nothing to do with the physiological conception ofenergy, whose inner introspective side it presents. Consciousness in itself isthe Atma. Both mind and body, of which latter the brain is a part, are imperfector veiled expressions of Consciousness, which in the case of body is so veiled[117] that it has the appearance of unconsciousness. The living brain isconstituted of gross sensible matter (Mahabhuta) infused by Prana. Its materialhas been worked up so as to constitute a suitable vehicle for the expression ofconsciousness in the form of mind (Antahkarana). As consciousness is not aproperty of the body, neither is it a mere function of the brain. The fact thatmental consciousness is affected or disappears with disorder of the brain provesthe necessity of the latter for the expression of such consciousness, and notthat consciousness is inherent alone in brain or that it is the property of thesame. On each side of the vertebral column there is a chain of ganglia connectedwith nerve fibre, called the sympathetic cord (Ida and Pingala), extending allthe way from the base of the skull to the coccyx. This is in communication withthe spinal cord. It is noteworthy that there is in the thoracic and lumbarregions a ganglion of each chain corresponding with great regularity to eachspinal nerve, though in the cervical region many of them appear to be missing;and that extra large clusters of nervous structure are to be found in the regionof the heart, stomach, and lungs, the regions governed by the Anahata, Manipura,and Vishuddha, respectively, the three upper of the five Chakras hereinafterdescribed. From the sympathetic chain on each side nerve fibres pass to theviscera of the abdomen and thorax. From these, nerves are also given off whichpass back into the spinal nerves, and others which pass into some of the cranialnerves; these are thus distributed to the blood vessels of the limbs, trunk, andother parts to which the spinal or cranial nerves go. The sympathetic nerveschiefly carry impulses which govern the muscular tissue of the viscera and themuscular coat of the small arteries of the various tissues. It is through thesympathetic that the tone of the [118] bloodvessels is kept up by the action ofthe vaso-motor centre in the spinal bulb. The sympathetic, however, derives theimpulses which it distributes from the central nervous system; these do notarise in the sympathetic self. The impulses issue from the spinal cord by theanterior roots of the spinal nerves, and pass through short branches into thesympathetic chains. The work of the sympathetic systems controls and influencesthe circulation, digestion, and respiration.The anatomical arrangement of the central nervous system is excessivelyintricate, and the events which take place in that tangle of fibre, cell andfibril, are, on the other hand, even now almost unknown. And so it has beenadmitted that in the description of the physiology of the central nervous systemwe can as yet do little more than trace the paths by which impulses may passbetween one portion of the system and another, and from the anatomicalconnections deduce, with more or less probability, the nature of thephysiological nexus which its parts form with each other and the rest of thebody. In a general way, however, there may (it is said) be reasons to supposethat there are nervous centres in the central system related in a special way tospecial mechanisms, sensory, secretory, or motor, and that centres, such as thealleged genito-spinal centre, for a given physiological action exist in adefinite portion of the spinal cord. It is the subtle aspect of such centres asexpressions of consciousness (Chaitanya) embodied in various forms of MayaShakti which is here called Chakra. These are related through intermediateconductors with the gross organs of generation, micturition, digestion, cardiacaction, and respiration in ultimate relation with the Muladhara, Svadhishthana,Manipura, Anahata, and Vishuddha Chakras respectively, just as tracts have beenassigned in special, even if not exclusive, relation with [119] variousperceptive, volitional, and ideative processes.” (Arthur Avalon, The Serpentpower, pp. 126-129)These centres vary in activity according to the evolutionary status of theindividual. In some people certain centres are “awake” and in others the samecentres may be relatively quiescent. In certain types, the solar plexus centrewill be active or dominant, in others the heart, in still others the throat. Invery few as yet, is the head centre active. Speaking largely, in savage peopleand the little evolved, the three centres below the diaphragm—the centre at thebase of the spine, the sacral centre and the solar plexus centre—are alive anddominant, but the centres above the diaphragm are “asleep.” In average humanitythe throat centre is beginning to make itself felt with the head and heartcentres still asleep. In the highly evolved human being, the race leader, theintuitive philosopher and the scientist, and in the great saints, both the headand heart centres are making their vibrations felt, priority between head andheart being determined by type, and the quality of the emotional and mentalconsciousness.According, then, to the development of the man these force centres become aliveand dominant, and according to their aliveness various types of activity maketheir presence felt. The centres below the diaphragm govern the physical life ofthe material form and the animal psychic life, found both [120] in man and inthe animal. Those above the diaphragm concern the intellectual and spirituallife and bring about those activities in which man demonstrates that his statusis different to, and higher than that of the animal, and that he is climbingupward on the ladder of evolution.Such in brief is the teaching of the East with regard to the seven centres offorce or chakras.When we compare the Eastern Doctrine of the seven centres with the Westerndoctrine of glands, we find first of all a striking fact with regard tolocality. The seven centres of force are to be found in the same region wherethe glands are located, and each centre of force might well be (and according toIndian teaching is) the source of power and of life for the corresponding gland.The following comparative table shows this identity of location.CENTRES GLANDS Head centre Pineal gland Centre between eyebrows Pituitary bodyThroat centre Thyroid gland Heart centre Thymus gland Solar plexus centrePancreas Sacral centre The gonads Centre at base of spine Adrenal glandsA second fact, even more striking than the first, is that the force centreswhich are awake conform to the glands whose functions are known and of [121]which most of the secretions or hormones, have been discovered. The centres thatare asleep or awakening in advanced members of the race, conform to the glandswhose functions are relatively unknown and whose secretions in the main have notbeen isolated. It will be noted for example that Dr. Berman states that thesecretion of the pineal gland, one of the two in the pituitary body and thethymus gland, are listed as unknown, as is the secretion of the cortex adrenalgland. These conform to the sleeping or awakening heart centre, throat centre,centre in the head, and at the base of the spine.Is this an interesting coincidence? Or are we faced with the fact that in eachcase these glands with the undiscovered hormones, are allied to a centre whichis asleep, not yet awakened in average humanity?I believe it will eventually be established that the glands have been broughtinto being through the energy of the centres, for those centres which, inaverage humanity, are awake and functioning seem to be related to glands, whosepeculiar secretion has been isolated, and its action in relation to thebloodstream known, whilst those centres which are as yet asleep and undevelopedseem to be allied to glands whose secretion is only partially known or totallyunknown. It is in any case worthy of consideration.The Occidental psychologists are consequently right when they state that a manis what his glands [122] make him, and that we are no better or worse than ourpeculiar endocrine system. But the reason for this may lie in the correctness ofthe Oriental theory as to the force centres. The condition of the glands andtheir super-activity or sub-normality, and their right or wrong functioning maybe determined by the state of those centres. The glands are only outer symbols,the visible, material aspect of a far greater and more intricate system. Theyare determined by the character of the soul life which plays through them, andthe soul which controls and dominates all.The state of the centres, then, is dependent upon the type and quality of soulforce vibrating through them. In the undeveloped person it is simply the lifeforce, prana, which is active and registers. This nurtures the animal life andbrings the lower centres (the centre at the base of the spine and the sacralcentre) into activity. Later, as man develops, the consciousness, soul-aspect,gradually makes its presence felt and brings the solar plexus centre intoactivity. This centre is the seat of the lower psychic sentient life both in manand in the animal, and is often referred to as the instinctual brain. BhagavanDas teaches us that:“It is worth noting that in Sanskrit literature the navel is often treated asmore central and almost more essential to the organism than the heart.Indications of the importance of the heart are not wanting, it is true, ... butit is probable that physiologically the ‘navel’ was the more vital organ in theearlier stages [123] of evolution, and is even at the present stage moreessentially connected with desire proper than the heart which may perhaps beregarded as connected with the actional sub-division of desire.” (Bhagavan Das,The Science of the Sacred word, Vol. I, p. 82)He quotes Mrs. Besant also in the following paragraph:“The ‘navel’ represents the solar plexus, perhaps the most important plexus ofthe sympathetic system; it controls the digestive tract, and sends its branchesto liver, spleen, stomach, as well as to the alimentary canal and generativeorgans. Nor is it unconnected with the lungs and heart. It may he regarded asthe brain of the sympathetic system, and responds with dangerous facility tothought; concentration on it, often rashly undertaken, is apt to result in apeculiarly intractable form of nervous disease. Emotions set up in it violentdisturbances, and the feeling of a nausea, which often follows an emotionalshock, is due to its excited action.” (Bhagavan Das, The Science of the Sacredword, Vol. I, p. 83)Man functions today through the medium of these three centres for the most part.The forces of the body serve to feed and stimulate the sex life through thegonads, they create the urge to combat and to evolve through the adrenal glands,the glands of combat, and of struggle; they govern the psychic instinctual lifethrough the solar plexus. Thus the personal man is mobilised and becomes aconscious sentient human being. As his evolution proceeds, the self or soulbecomes more and more [124] active and dominant in man and in his corporealexistence, and little by little all parts of the etheric structure becomevitally awake. Gradually the higher centres come into increased activity, andthe emphasis of the force pouring through the body shifts to the centres abovethe diaphragm. The throat centre awakens and becomes the organ of creative work;the heart centre is vivified and the man becomes aware of his soulrelationships, his group responsibilities and the inclusiveness of thelife-soul. Finally the head centres awaken and another range of perceptionsenters into his consciousness. He becomes aware of himself as a soul, integratedas a personality, and later still he becomes aware of the world of spirit, ofdivine life, of the unseen world of spirits, and of that “cloud of witnesses”who testify to the reality of the soul life.One of the objectives of human evolution is to accomplish this. The centre atthe base of the spine, the heart and head centres, must come into fullfunctioning activity and thus, through a blending of the energy latent in matteritself and stored up in the centre at the base of the spine, of the energy ofthe soul, which has its seat in the heart, and of the energy of the spirit,centred in the head, bring the human being to the highest point of perfection.Through this fusion of energies he becomes an active expression of God—spirit,soul, body, blended and united so that the body is indeed the vehicle for thesoul, and that soul is indeed the expression of the will and purpose of thespirit.[125] What did Christ say when on earth? “He that hath seen me hath seen theFather.” (John XIV: 9) . He said also, “He that believeth on Me, the works thatI do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I gounto My Father” (John XIV: 12) . He was the Soul incarnate in the body,revealing the Father, the Spirit, and through the mechanism of the body,demonstrating the powers of the soul, which, the Hindus claim, follow upon theawakening of the centres, and which they list as follows:1. Anima . . . the power to penetrate all bodies, and to bring the dead to life.Christ could pass unseen into rooms, and could raise the dead. (See Luke 24:36,Mark 16:14, John 20:19, John 11.)2. Mahima . . . the power to include or make oneself large or to comprehend theuniverse. Christ knew all things. (Matt. 12:25, John 2:24, John 6:64.)3. Laghima . . . the power to make oneself light so that one could float in theair or walk on the water. Christ walked on the water. (Matt. 14:25, 26, Mark6:48.)4. Garima . . . the power to make oneself heavy. There is no record in theChristian Scripture of Christ exercising this power.5. Prapti . . . the predicting of events (Christ foretold his crucifixion Matt.26:2, Luke 24:7) and of the power to cure diseases (Christ healed hundreds,Matt. 12:15, 14:15), and of clairvoyance [126] and clairaudience. (Christ wasboth clairvoyant, John 1:48, and clairaudient, John 12:29.)6. Prakamega . . . the power to preserve the body. Christ reappeared to Hisdisciples after death with the same body, apparently, that they knew. (John20:20-27.)7. Visitvan . . . the power of self control, the power to control animals, andpeople. All these Christ demonstrated, even to the control of thedemon-possessed persons, and of the hogs who ran down a steep place into thesea. (Matt. 8, Mark 5, Mark 9.)8. Ishatvan . . . the power of universal dominion. This is everywhere claimedfor Christ, and is indicated by his being seated on the right hand of God.And is the possession of these powers and the fulfilment of Christ’s prophecythat we shall do these greater things, so contrary to what the West calls commonsense? In the radio, we broadcast waves of sound and we time and amplify them,but after all we merely re-enforce the sound waves which in their originalsubtle form, are pouring in upon us. What more natural than this, that man, whohas constructed mechanical re-enforcements, should himself become so sensitiveas to pick up the sound waves unaided, and thus be termed clairaudient? And isnot thought transference (which even the most sceptical must recognise) noneother than a special kind of broadcasting? And so with other “miracles,” is notthe material world controlled [127] by subtler forces and powers, and may notman learn in time to operate in the subtler field and thereby acquire dominanceover the merely physical and material?Such is the age-long belief of India—that through the development of the souland spirit, through the awakening of all the centres, man comes to his maturityand his glory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII — CONCLUSION[128] In this book we have considered the two systems of psychology, the Easternand the Western. Taken together we have a complete picture of man as a livingsoul, functioning through a certain mechanism. Part of this, the etheric bodywith its centres, is subtle, unseen and beyond the reach of our five senses, andanother part is in the dense physical realm, namely the endocrine glands and thenervous system, which control the rest of the dense physical manifestation.These two parts, we believe, form one whole.The soul is always the great reality, the expression of the one life, which ismade up of the etheric and dense bodies. It is the soul force playing upon andfunctioning through the etheric body which evolves the specialised centres inthat body, and which in turn acts upon the dense physical.The question which appeals most strongly to the Western mind is how to achievegreater efficiency in operation. Man, the soul, is limited in his operatingefficiency by the condition of his instrument. If the glands, nervous system andthe etheric body with its centres are out of adjustment and not functioningproperly, man, the soul, must repair or heal them. It is only because man isessentially [129] a living soul that we can even conceive of his glands as notfunctioning properly, much less proceed to study, correct and perfect them.Work directly upon the glands and the nerve centres through the use of medicinesand by other means is essentially repair work, and is limited to the higheststate of those particular glands and nerve centres originally created by theparticular man in question. The same is equally, and if anything, moreemphatically true of the centres in the etheric body which can be affected bycertain Oriental practices of breathing, mantras and posture. Such practices aremost dangerous, often, indeed, leading to insanity. Eventually, it is to behoped, we shall have sufficient knowledge and experience to work withintelligence directly upon the centres and thus he able to control moreeffectively the neuroses and glands of the physical body.Three theories apparently emerge as the result of our investigation, and form atriple hypothesis to account for man as an organism, demonstrating life,self-consciousness and intelligent purpose.The first is: As a man’s glands and nervous system, so is he . His temperament,natural qualities and intelligent handling of his life experiences and of hisenvironment are determined by his endocrine system. So says the West.The second is: As a man’s centres, so is he . The quiescence or the activity ofcertain focal points of energy in the human, etheric body, determine hischaracter, his method of expression, his type and [130] also the tenure of hisbody. His activities on the physical plane are entirely dependent upon thequalities of force flowing through his centres. So says the East.The third is: The glands and neuroses as well as the centres are conditioned bythe control or lack of control exerted by the soul.It might be argued that we have only succeeded in pushing the whole matter backinto the realms of the unseen and the unprovable. But is this really so? Havenot many factors now accepted as realities emerged from the speculations andvague hypotheses of the past ages? Has not what was regarded as unprovable inthe past been proved and demonstrated in the present age? Might it not bepossible to apply a technique and employ a method which may in time suffice,through the mass of direct available evidence, to give us a clearer perceptionof the factors which are at present so obscure to us?The West comes forward as we have seen with its facts concerning the structure.Man’s mechanism is determined by his endocrine system plus the nervous system,the response apparatus. Can we approach the subject from this standpoint and bya treatment of the human glands produce perfection of the human body and thuseventually lead man out into the full light of the soul? Can divinity beunfolded through physical means? Or, accepting the Eastern position that thecentres are the mediums of expression for the soul, and responsible [131] forthe building and control of the body, through the nervous system and the glands,can we investigate and apply a recognisably dangerous method and work directlyon or through the centres?Is there a third way by means of which we can avoid the purely physical approachand also the danger of awakening the centres prematurely? May it not be possibleto arrive at a solution and a method which will give the soul the full use ofits instrument, and produce that perfect interplay between soul and body which aright activity of the centres is claimed to bring about?There is a way whereby man can ascertain that he is really a soul, and thereforeis able to control his instrument of expression, the threefold lower nature, thesum total of psychical and mental states. Through this method it is possible tobring about a union of the wisdom of the East and the knowledge of the West, sothat the best aspects of each system can be available to mankind as a whole.In considering the possibility of man discovering his soul, there must be, tostart with, a willingness to accept an hypothesis, for hypotheses have alwaysbeen the starting point for knowledge. We assume then, as a working hypothesisthat man is a soul and possesses a body, and that there is a unifying mediumlinking these two in the form of an energy body.[132] Those who have sought to ascertain the fact of the existence of the souland of its vitalising apparatus hitherto can be divided into two groups. Thereare the mystics who have employed aspiration and emotion, plus physical means,and there are those who are more purely mental in calibre, and who have utilisedthe intellect and the mind, in order to arrive at spiritual knowledge. This longline of knowers of God have used different terminologies, but it is immaterialfor our purpose whether they call the soul the self, the Beloved, the One, orGod, or Christ. The mystic flagellated and misused his body through fasting andover-discipline. He thus reduced the claims of the fleshly appetites. To this headded an intense devotion for the Beloved and a longing for the Vision. At theclose of years of strenuous exercise he found that which he sought, and wasunited with that Beloved.The second group employed the reason and practised mind control, plus sternemotional and physical control. Through the one-pointedness of their searchthey, too, found reality and came into a wide consciousness of the eternal plan,arriving at union with the Universal Soul.Both groups bear testimony to the truth of the existence of the Soul, but,limited by their peculiar bent and method, their testimony is one-sided. One istoo visionary, mystical and emotional; the other too academic, intellectual andform-building. Now, through the wide dissemination of human [133] knowledge andthe close intercourse existing between minds through the medium of literature,the spoken word and travel, the time has come when a fusion is, for the firsttime, generally possible, and, from the past conclusions of the philosophers andsaints of both hemispheres, we should be able to work out a system and a methodwhich will be for our day and generation the mode of spiritual achievement.It becomes therefore practical for certain initial steps to be taken and thesemight be summarised as follows:(a) A sane treatment of the physical body, utilising the knowledge of the West,particularly with reference to preventive medicine and the general health of theendocrine system.(b) An intellectual understanding and application of the basic facts of modernpsychology and a sane psycho-analysis, thus arriving at a knowledge of themechanism, mental, emotional and physical, through which the soul seeksexpression.(c) A recognition of the fact that, as the physical body is an automaton,responsive to and controlled by the desires and the emotional nature, so theseemotional states of consciousness (extending all the way from love of food tolove of God) may be controlled by the reasoning mind.(d) Growing out of all this will come a study of the laws of mind, and thus therelationship between the mind and the brain may be understood and utilised.[134] When these four points are grasped and their effect is felt in man’spersonality, we shall have the integrated and coordinated organism; thestructure can then be regarded as ready for direction by the soul. The abovestages must be understood, not as proceeding sequentially, but as going forwardsimultaneously. It is also apparent that perfect intellectual knowledge of thesoul and of the world which that soul reveals is only possible to the man whohas this outlined equipment. A sense of God, an appreciation of the true andbeautiful, and a contact with the mystical vision is at all times possible tothose whose heart centre is awake and functioning. Such Lovers of God haveexisted through the ages; they feel, sense, love and adore, but the link betweensoul, mind and brain is lacking. When to this mystical equipment there is addedthe intellectual, then the head centre is awakened, the pineal gland is nolonger in an atrophied condition, but is known to be the seat of the soul and ofthe directing spiritual will. When both these centres are awakened we have thegreat outstanding spiritual personalities who work with consecrated heart andbrain and set their seal on world thought. Hitherto the way of the mystic hasbeen the way of the majority, and the way of the intellect has been for the few.But the race is now at the stage where, basing its hypothesis upon the mysticalexperiences of the many, it can go forward from feeling and adoration toknowledge, and from love of God into knowledge of God.[135] This will be the case when the wisdom of the East is added to theknowledge of the West and the technique of the science of the soul is imposedupon our Western intellectual types. It is impossible to enlarge at length uponthis technique. It might, however, be briefly described as being divided intoeight stages which can be listed as follows:1. Control of our relations to others, summed up under the word harmlessnesswhich is defined in the East by the Five Commandments. These are: Harmlessness,truth to all beings, abstention from theft, from incontinence and from avarice.(Alice A. Bailey, The light of the Soul, p. 184)2. Purity of life as outlined in the Five Rules: Internal and externalpurification, contentment, fiery aspiration, spiritual reading and devotion toIshvara (the divine Self). (Alice A. Bailey, The light of the Soul, p. 187)3. Poise.4. Right control of the life force and hence direct action by the soul upon theetheric body. This control of energy and therefore of the centres and of thephysical body is only possible after a man has achieved purity and poise. He isnot permitted knowledge of the laws governing energy until such time as he haslearned, through discipline, the control of the animal nature, and has reached apoint where he is no longer swayed by moods and selfishness.5. Abstraction. A term which covers the power to centre one’s consciousness inthe head and there [136] to function as a soul, or to withdraw the outgoingconsciousness front things objective and tangible, and so turn it within.6. Attention or concentration. This is one-pointed living, and involves also thebringing the mind into activity in the place of the emotions. Thus the emotionaland physical man are controlled by the focussed mind.7. Meditation is prolonged attention or concentration and gives the power tofocus the mind upon the soul and its concerns. This produces radical changes inthe organism and substantiates the truth of the statement that, “as a manthinketh, so is he.”8. Contemplation is the act of the soul in its own realm as it looks out overthe forms and contacts the energies found in the fifth or spiritual kingdom innature. This act is followed by the pouring down into the brain (by way of thecontrolled mind) of soul knowledge and energy. This activity of the soulproduces what has been called illumination: it brings about the energising ofthe entire man and awakens the centres in proper rhythm and progression.This consciously directed spiritual energy playing through the vital body andthe centres should, it is claimed, bring physical man and the endocrine systemeventually into such a condition that we should have perfect health andtherefore a perfect apparatus for soul expression. In this way we are taughtthat man can arrive at a definite knowledge of the soul, and can know himself tobe “the deeper [137] Being,” able to use his mechanism with definite purpose,and thus function as a soul.A study of the lives of the great mystics, saints and adepts of both hemisphereswill give much information about the phenomenal effects resulting from followingthe above method, even after we have eliminated much that savours ofhallucination and psychopathic conditions. Forms of clairvoyance, of previsionand of telepathic communication, clairaudient faculties and the peculiar powerto psychometrise are frequently seen. It should be remembered, however, that allthese powers have their spiritual manifestations and also their lower. A. E.Powell says:“There are, roughly, two main kinds of clairvoyance, the lower and the higher.The lower variety appears sporadically in undeveloped people, such as thesavages of Central Africa, and is a sort of massive sensation vaguely belongingto the whole etheric body, rather than an exact and definite sense-perceptioncommunicated through a specialized organ. It is practically beyond man’scontrol. The Etheric Double being in exceedingly close relationship with thenervous system, any action on one of them reacts speedily on the other. In thelower clairvoyance the corresponding nervous disturbance is almost entirely inthe sympathetic system.In more developed races the vague sensitiveness usually disappears as the mentalfaculties are developed. Later on, when the spiritual man begins to unfold, heregains clairvoyant power. This time, however, the faculty is precise and exact,under the control of the will, and exercised through a sense-organ. Any [138]nervous action set up is almost exclusively in the cerebro-spinal system.The lower forms of psychism are most frequent in animals and very unintelligenthuman beings. Hysterical and ill-regulated psychism is due to the smalldevelopment of the brain and the dominance of the sympathetic system, the largenucleated ganglionic cells in this system containing a very large proportion ofetheric matter, and thus being easily affected by the coarser astralvibrations.” (A.E. Powell, The Etheric Double, pp. 102, 103)It has been frequently noticed that cats and dogs and low-grade human beings canfrequently see and hear that which the normal and more intelligent person failsto register. This faculty is, however, unconscious, and the man is frequently anhallucinated victim. The saint and seer likewise see and hear, but their powersare utilised at will and are entirely under their control. A large field forinvestigation in these matters lies open to all psychical investigators, andwhen the hypothesis of the vital body and the centres is admitted, much realknowledge may come.It is claimed by the teachers of the Eastern science of the soul that theawakening of the various centres reveals states of subtler matter than thephysical. It is mainly, however, with the centres above the diaphragm that thespiritual man concerns himself, conferring, as they do, such powers as spiritualperception, correct understanding and interpretation of one’s fellowmen, sothat, like Christ, we know what is in man, and can grasp why [139] a man is whathe is, and acts as he does. The force of inspiration, the highest power of themall, works out as the inspiring of creative work through the medium of thethroat centre, and of humanitarian enterprises through the medium of the heartcentre.The second effect claimed by this group is the transference of the force belowthe diaphragm to the centres above. Through evolution and the effect ofmeditation work a man is able to function consciously through his three majorcentres, (head, heart and throat) leaving the three lower centres, (the base ofthe spine, sacral centre and solar plexus) to carry on their normal function ofenergising the body automatically, so that the digestive apparatus and thereproductive system and certain aspects of the nervous mechanism can carryforward their work. According to this theory, the majority of people live “belowthe diaphragm” and the life force is centred in the purely animal and sensorylife; the sex life and the emotional life are dominant, and all the forceflowing into and through the sacral centre and the solar plexus go to thestimulation of certain physiological and lower psychical processes. As manevolves, however, the direction of the force changes. We have seen that theforce is dual, being partially life force and partially soul force, oneexpressing itself through the blood and the other through the nervous system.The life force aspect continues to carry forward its function of vitalising andempowering all [140] the organs and structures of the body, but the soul force,hitherto relatively quiescent, begins to turn upwards. The soul force in thecentre at the base of the spine is carried to the head via the spinal canal,passing through each centre in turn, gathering increasing soul energy at eachpoint.The psychological effects of this transfer of consciousness are interesting.When the soul is “enthroned” (as the scientific Oriental books put it) in thehead, it attracts upward to itself, through the power of its magnetism, theforce latent at the base of the spine. Thus is produced the complete blending ofspiritual energy and the force in matter itself through the attractive energy ofthe soul. This is what is meant by the arousing of the Kundalini power and itshould be done by the magnetism of the dominant soul, and not by meditation onany specific centre or by conscious action on the force of matter.The soul energy of the sacral centre must be carried to the highest creativecentre, the throat. The emphasis will then be laid on creative work carriedforward for the sake of the group and not on the active sex life of the manconcerned.The energy of the solar plexus centre has, equally, to be transferred andcarried to the heart, and the consciousness then is no longer self-centred andpurely selfish, but the man becomes group-conscious and inclusive in hisattitude to people and to life. He is no longer antagonistic and exclusive. Heknows and understands. He pities, [141] loves and serves. There is a wide fieldfor research once this relationship between centre and centre, and betweencentre and glands, is grasped; the effects, physiological as well as psychical,will warrant close study.It is interesting also to note another claim made by students of the AgelessWisdom. When man has reached a fairly high state of evolution the throat centreis functioning and he is beginning to take his place in the work of the world;he has a definite output in some field of world activity. His personality thenmay be regarded as organised, and he can be deemed to have reached his maturity.The psychologists tell us that the pituitary body is the seat of the emotionaland mental characteristics. In one lobe the reasoning mind has its seat, whilstthe other is responsible for the imaginative emotional faculties, and the powerto visualise. In man, with creative power, and, therefore, with a developedpersonality, the two lobes of the pituitary body are equal to the demand, andfrom them can be deduced the status of the material aspect, the mechanismthrough which the soul moves and expresses itself. This gland is concerned withthe centre between the eyebrows. This centre is negative to the centre in thehead which is responsive to the energy of the Soul. When through conformity tothe outlined technique, the soul assumes control, energises the head centre andbrings the pineal gland from an atrophied to a functioning condition as in thedays of childhood, the positive aspect [142] begins to play its part. Arelationship is set up between the negative centre and its counterpart, thepituitary body, and the positive centre and its counterpart, the pineal gland.As time proceeds, it is claimed, a magnetic field is set up, soul and body meet,the father and mother come into relationship and the soul is brought to thebirth in the consciousness of man. This is the birth of the Christ in the Houseof God, and the coming into being of the true man; of this the sex organs andtheir reproductive activities on the physical plane are the outer concretisedsymbol. The perversions of sex magic so widely prevalent are a distortion ofthis true spiritual union or fusion between the two centres of energy in thehead, which are, in their turn, figurative of the relation between soul andbody. Sex magic relegates the process to the centre below the diaphragm and to arelation between two persons on the physical plane. The true process is carriedforward within a man’s own nature, centred in the head and the relation isbetween the soul and the body, instead of between man and woman.Another effect claimed for this relationship between the two head centres andtheir corresponding glands is that the interplay between the two produces theshining forth of a light. There is much corroborative evidence in thisconnection in the Scriptures of the world, including Christ’s injunction to Hisfollowers to “let their light shine.” There is cumulative evidence also in thelives of [143] the mystics, who again and again in their writings bear testimonyto a light that has been seen. I sent out a letter to a group of students (whohave been studying meditation for several years) asking if they were aware ofany phenomena of interest as the result of their work. The letter was not sentto neurotics and visionary types, but to men and women of good standing in thebusiness, artistic and literary fields, and with accomplishment to their credit.Seventy-five per cent testified to seeing a light in the head. Were theyhallucinated? Were they the victims of their imaginations? What was it they saw?and constantly see?An interesting field for investigation lies here also, and the results may havea basis in the fact, now recognised by science, that light is matter, and matteris light. When the soul is functioning and the man has achieved conscious unionwith that soul, he may then, through the extra stimulation involved, becomeaware of the light of the etheric body at its main point of junction with thephysical body at the most important centre in the body, the head centre.Professor Bazzoni says:“We have seen that all forms of matter on the earth are made up of 92 differentkinds of atoms grouped into molecules which, taken together in countlessmillions, form all of the bodies which we see about us and indeed for thatmatter, our own bodies. Now, any one of these 92 kinds of atoms when stimulatedin certain ways well known to science can be made to give off light—generallycoloured light—and the nature of [144] this light is peculiar and characteristicfor each of the 92 atoms.” (C. B. Bazzoni, Kernels of the Universe, P. 31) 4Does this throw any light on our problem, provided the hypothesis of an ethericbody is admitted? Is the halo around the heads of saints and of deity in all theancient pictures of both hemispheres an indication that the artists knew theywere painting illuminated men in the physical as well as in the spiritual sense?These things should be investigated, and either proved or disproved.The possibility of unifying the two great schools of thought which seek toaccount for the unit man in terms of Western achievement and of Easternphilosophy based on a technique of soul control is therefore in the nature of anexperiment. Given the willingness to accept what the Western student regards ashypothetical and given an open mind, what can be done of specific and practicalimport to demonstrate as truth or to reject as false the arguments put forwardin this book?Maeterlinck quotes Herbert Spencer to the effect that:“Perpetually to construct ideas requiring the utmost stretch of our facultiesand perpetually to find that such ideas must be abandoned as futileimaginations, may realize to us more fully than any other course the greatnessof that which we vainly strive to grasp.... By continually seeking to know andbeing continually thrown back with a deepened conviction of the impossibility ofknowing, we may keep alive the consciousness [145] that it is alike our highestwisdom and our highest duty to regard that through which all things exist as theUnknowable.” Maurice Maeterlinck, The Light beyond p. 95)But may it not be possible, however, to clear our vision somewhat and “deepeningour conviction,” arrive at a better understanding of the forms and aspects whichveil that unknowable Essential Reality in whose Body we “live and move and haveour being?”Granted that it is the phenomenal world, whether it is the human family we areconsidering, or the forms visioned and contacted in the Kingdom of the Soul, itmay be eventually proved true that, progressively, the forms (as they mount inthe scale of being) may reveal to us expanding truths about that Essential Life.As the mechanism develops and improves so may our concepts of Divinity. EdwardCarpenter expresses this idea in the following words:“Dr. Frazer, in the conclusion of his great work, The Golden Bough , bidsfarewell to his readers with the following words: ‘The laws of Nature are merelyhypotheses devised to explain that ever-shifting phantasmagoria of thought whichwe dignify with the high-sounding names of the World and the Universe. In thelast analysis magic, religion and science are nothing but theories (of thought);and as science has supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter itself besuperseded by some more perfect hypothesis, perhaps by some perfectly differentway of looking at phenomena, of registering the shadows on the screen—of [146]which we in this generation can form no idea.’ I imagine Dr. Frazer is right inthinking that ‘a way of looking at phenomena’ different from the way of science,may some day prevail. But I think this change will come, not so much by thegrowth of Science itself or the extension of its ‘hypotheses,’ as by a growthand expansion of the human heart and a change in its psychology and powers ofperception.” (Edward Carpenter, Pagan and Chrisitan Creeds; Their Origin andMeaning, p. 278)Maeterlinck sums this up very succinctly when he says: “It behooves us thereforeto clear away conceptions that emanate only from our body, even as the miststhat veil the daylight from our sight emanate only from the lowlands. Pascal hassaid, once and for all: ‘The narrow limits of our being conceal infinity fromour view.’” (Maurice Maeterlinck, The Light beyond p. 73)Practical suggestions must be made in the attempt to disprove the supernatural(if it might be so expressed) and prove that the subjective states to which themystic and seer testify are simply demonstrations of natural forces and powers.These powers man has failed as yet to recognise and control, just as he failedcenturies ago to cognise those forces which he is now able, to some extent atleast, to understand and use, and which are the glory of our presentcivilisation. Let us prove one of these soul powers to be a fact in nature andthe portals of a new world will open before humanity. Dr. Leary appreciates thiswhen he says: [147]“It is somehow felt that there are some qualities, some traits at least of somepersonalities, which cannot be accounted for in terms of the activity of anyphysical structure. Nor is this an unimportant point which can be summarilydismissed as mere superstition; it is too widespread, too highly charged withemotion, too much shared in even by some psychologists to be ignored. And it isworth while once more mentioning, if there be any such traits, spiritual or whatnot, which by definition or assumption are not based on structure, the admissionof even the smallest and seemingly most unimportant of these will inevitably andcompletely negative the whole field of science, for determinism to be truedeterminism must be completely so.” (Daniel H Leary, Ph.D., Modern Psychology:Normal and Abnormal, pp. 191, 192.)First it should be possible to found a laboratory where the claims of thestudent of the Oriental philosophy in connection with the vitalising soul can besubstantiated or proved false. The phenomena of death can be studied from theangle of the withdrawal of the soul. The radiations from the human body have, ofcourse, received attention, but specific investigation of the spine and itsrelation to the centres is as yet a new field of study, though Dr. Baraduc ofthe Sorbonne, Paris, did some interesting work in this connection forty-fiveyears ago. His book, L’Ame Vitale , is suggestive, though conjectural, and hiscontentions need substantiating.The whole subject of the vital body and its effects on the nervous system andthe glands open up an immense field for study; whilst the relationship [148] ofthe ether-body of man not only to his nerve apparatus but to the planetaryetheric body or the ether in which he, as an organism, has his place, is yet anuntouched field.Secondly it should be possible to gather testimony as to the fact and nature ofthe light in the head to which so many testify.The recent spectacular experiments into the nature of telepathy are tending inthe right direction, but this technique of telepathy is as yet in its infancy;much will be revealed when a distinction is made between communication from mindto mind, which is mental telepathy, and that much rarer form of communicationbetween soul and soul and between soul and brain. This latter form has beencalled inspiration and has brought into being the Scriptures and the so-called“inspired” writings of the world, and has guided the mental processes of thegreat inventors and scientists, poets and artists.Telepathy and inspiration are as dependent upon the individual human ethericbody and its relation to the universal ether as is light itself or the radio.They bear witness to this subtler world of spirit and of soul.Pupin in the epilogue to The New Reformation says:“The creative power of the soul is the only guide in our attempts to decipherthe meaning of this ultra-material substance. It furnishes the most reliablestandard of comparing the soul of one man with the soul of another man and withthat of lower animals. [149] This comparison, resembling, to some extent, thescientific methods of quantitative measurement, has been going on ever sincecivilization began. The procedure of this inquiry is in many ways equivalent tothe scientific method of inquiry by observation, experiment and calculation;what it lacks in precision it makes up by its vast number of trials and errorsextending over many centuries of qualitative measurements by careful comparison.It resulted in the universal verdict, that not only is the soul of man farsuperior to the animal soul, but that this difference is immeasurably greaterthan the difference in their bodily structures. The comparison revealed also anelement in this difference which towers high above all the other differentiatingelements; it is the spiritual element. The creative power of the human soul hascreated a new world in human consciousness; it is the spiritual world.” (MichaelPupin, The New Reformation, pp. 264, 265.)Among other possible avenues of research is the carrying forward of the work ofDr. Kilner with the human aura, which he has embodied in his book, The HumanAtmosphere . Still further lines of investigation into the supernormal powershave been well summed up for us in a recent statement from an Australianperiodical called The Federal Independent , and from which two paragraphs arehere quoted:“New light on Christ’s walking on the waters was thrown recently by a scientistwho has been making a special study of Einstein’s newest theory of relativity.As a result of his investigations Professor H.H. Sheldon says that he may findit possible to assert that the Biblical narrative at which the sceptics have solong [150] mocked is a fact explicable by scientific laws. ‘The miracle can beaccepted by the most sceptical minds as soon as they recognize the fact that thebasic laws of relativistic mechanics and of electricity can be reduced to oneformula, and that the power of electromagnetism can influence and completelycontrol gravitation,’ said Professor Sheldon. According to Einstein’s latestmathematical theory there is only one substance and one universal law containingelectric and gravitational components, both of which are united into a singleformula, and each of which influences the other. Dr. Sheldon now believes thatas a result of this discovery such things as keeping aeroplanes aloft withoutengines or material support, and stepping out of a window into the air withoutfear of falling, are avenues of investigation easily suggested. ‘If this theorystands up as a proof that electricity and gravitation are virtually the same, wecan actually isolate ourselves from the force of gravitation,’ he declared. Inactual proof of these seemingly incredible possibilities, Dr. Sheldon showed howa bar of permalloy, which is usually sensitive to magnetism, will remainsuspended seemingly by air alone, if a magnet is placed underneath it.In the light of Einstein’s new theory, therefore, it may be that Christ’sfreedom from the accepted laws of gravitation, which would have forced Him tosink as soon as His feet touched the surface of the sea, was due to a prodigiousamount of electro-magnetism in His own body, and from a force springing from thestrength of His personality and vitality. In all the paintings of Christ He isshown with a halo about His head. Once this halo was regarded as the product ofHis disciples’ overwrought imaginations. But during the last few years science,along with many students of psychic phenomena, has shown by means of actualexperiments that every human being has an aura which [151] strongly resemblesthat refulgence emanating from any powerful electric machine.Such a statement is a further proof that science is rapidly crossing theborder-line separating things material from things spiritual. Once we realizethat the knowledge of higher laws can overcome the resistance of lower laws,then we shall enter our true spiritual heritage.”We stand expectantly awaiting the dawn of that day when religion will stand upona scientific basis and the truths to which the ages bear witness will besubstantiated and proven, for, as Dr. Pupin further tells us:“Yes, God’s spiritual realities are invisible, but they are illustrated and madeintelligible by the physical realities revealed in the physical things which aremade. According to this interpretation of the Apostle’s words the physical andthe spiritual realities supplement each other. They are the two terminals of thesame realities, one terminal residing in the human soul, and the other in thethings of the external world. Here is one of the fundamental reasons why Scienceand Religion supplement each other. They are the two pillars of the portalthrough which the human soul enters the world where the divinity resides.”(Michael Pupin, The New Reformation, p. 272.)Then there will emerge a new race, with new capacities, new ideals, new conceptsabout God and matter, about life and spirit. Through that race and through thehumanity of the future there will be seen not only a mechanism and a structure,but a soul, an entity, who, using the mechanism, will [152] manifest its ownnature, which is love, wisdom and intelligence.Science has even recognised this ultimate possibility and noted that the trendof the evolutionary process is towards a more perfect adaptation between theform and the life. Everywhere throughout creation a purpose is working out, awill towards perfection is manifesting. That purpose and that will arecontrolled by love and wisdom and those two types of energy—the purpose ofspirit and the attractive force of the soul—are intelligently applied to theperfecting of the matter aspect. Spirit, soul and body—a divinetriplicity—manifest in the world and will carry all forward towards aconsummation that is pictured for us in the Scriptures of the world in a wealthof imagery, of colour and of form. Browning’s vision of this truth and hisexpression of it will sum up for us the results of our study and will be afitting close for this essay:“—and God renewsHis ancient rapture. Thus He dwells in all,From life’s minute beginnings, up at lastTo man—the consummation of this schemeOf being, the completion of this sphereOf life; whose attributes had here and thereBeen scattered o’er the visible world before,Asking to be combined, dim fragments meantTo be united in some wondrous whole,Imperfect qualities throughout creation,Suggesting some one creature yet to make,Some point where all these scattered rays should meet [153]Convergent in the faculties of man. . . .When all the race is perfected alikeAs man, that is; all tended to mankind,And, man produced, all has its end thus far;But in completed man begins anewA tendency to God. Prognostics toldMan’s near approach; so in man’s self ariseAugust anticipations, symbols, typesOf a dim splendour ever on beforeIn that eternal circle life pursues.For men begin to pass their nature’s bound,And find new hopes and cares which fast supplantTheir proper joys and griefs; they grow too greatFor narrow creeds of right and wrong, which fadeBefore the unmeasured thirst for good; while peaceRises within them ever more and more.Such men are even now upon the earth,Serene amid the half-formed creatures round.”(Robert Browning, Paracelsus)"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXNOTE I (ON CHAPTER IV)[154] The following extract from a recent publication puts the question of thesoul in another way, and perhaps, will give us some idea of the trend of modernWestern thought regarding it.The phrase religious insight is in itself vague. Is it not possible to give thephrase a definite content without departing from the critical attitude? One maybe helped to such a definition by asking oneself what element has tended to fallout of the life of the modern man with the decline of the traditionaldisciplines. According to Mr. Walter Lippmann, the conviction the modern man haslost is that “there is an immortal essence presiding like a king over hisappetites.” But why abandon the affirmation of such an “essence” or higher will,to the mere traditionalist? Why not affirm it first of all as a psychologicalfact, one of the immediate data of consciousness, a perception so primordialthat, compared with it, the deterministic denials of man’s moral freedom areonly a metaphysical dream? One would thus be in a position to perform a swiftflanking movement on the behaviourists and other naturalistic psychologists whoare to be regarded at present as among the chief enemies of human nature. Onemight at the same time be in a fair way to escape from the modernist dilemma andbecome a thorough-going and complete modern. [155]The philosophers have often debated the question of the priority of will orintellect in man. The quality of will that I am discussing and that rightlydeserves to be accounted super-rational, has, however, been associated intraditional Christianity not primarily with man’s will, but with God’s will inthe form of grace. The theologians have indulged in many unprofitable subtletiesapropos of grace. One cannot afford, however, as has been the modern tendency,to discard the psychological truth of the doctrine a long with these subtleties.The higher will must simply be accepted as a mystery that may be studied in itspractical effects, but that, in its ultimate nature, is incapable offormulation. Herein the higher will is not peculiar. “All things,” according tothe scholastic maxim, “end in a mystery.” The man of science is increasinglywilling to grant that the reality behind the phenomena he is studying not onlyeludes him, but must in the nature of the case ever elude him. He no longerholds, for example, as his more dogmatic forbears of the nineteenth centuryincline to do, that the mechanistic hypothesis, valuable as it has proved itselfto be as a laboratory technique, is absolutely true; its truth is, he admits,relative and provisional.The person who declines to turn the higher will to account until he is sure hehas grasped its ultimate nature is very much on a level with the man who shouldrefuse to make practical use of electrical energy until he is certain he has animpeccable theory of electricity. Negatively one may say of the higher will,without overstepping the critical attitude, that it is not the absolute, noragain the categorical imperative; not the organic and still less the mechanical;finally, not the “ideal” in the current sense of that term. Positively one maydefine it as the higher immediacy that is known in its relation to the lowerimmediacy—the merely temperamental [156] man with his impressions and emotionsand expansive desires—as a power of vital control. Failure to exercise thiscontrol is the spiritual indolence that is for both Christian and Buddhist achief source, if not the chief source, of evil. Though Aristotle, after theGreek fashion, gives the primacy not to will but to mind, the power of which Ihave been speaking is surely related to his “energy of soul,” the form ofactivity distinct from a mere outer working, deemed by him appropriate for thelife of leisure that he proposes as the goal of a liberal education.... Theenergy of soul that has served on the humanistic level for mediation appears onthe religious level in the form of meditation. Religion may of course mean agreat deal more than meditation. At the same time humanistic mediation that hasthe support of meditation may correctly be said to have a religious background.Mediation and meditation are after all only different stages in the sameascending “path” and should not be arbitrarily separated.(Article: Humanism: An Essay on Definition by Irving Babbitt, pp. 39-41. FromHumanism and America: Essays on the Outlook of Modern Civilization, edited byNorman Foerster.)NOTE II (ON CHAPTER VII)[157] It has been interesting to note the spread of hyperthyroidism at thistime, and various troubles connected with the thyroid gland. May not theseconditions be a substantiation of the Oriental theory? Many people from force ofcircumstances and strained economic conditions are leading an abnormal sex life,and are celibate. Others, from what may be a mistaken idea of spiritual demands,reject the normal marriage state, and pledge themselves to a life of celibacy.Owing to these conditions the force is raised to the centre which is its goal,and reaches the throat. The whole condition being abnormal and the man or womanbeing as yet emotionally centred, and the mental equipment (so necessary in truecreative work) being relatively mediocre, there is no ability to use thiscreative power, and there ensues an over-stimulation of the thyroid gland.Several such cases have been noted by us and seem to substantiate this position.This is one direction in which investigation and use of the scientific method ofmassing evidence to prove or disprove an hypothesis would appear to be capableof application. In the aggregate of cases and of testimony, light on this mattermay appear. When the transfer is normal and not premature the outcome is alongthe line of recognised creative work, literature, the drama, music and the artsin general.
