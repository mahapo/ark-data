I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity–not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

BAILEY“Before the soul can see, the harmony within must be attained, and fleshly eyesbe rendered blind to all illusion.Before the soul can hear, the image (Man) has to become as deaf to roarings asto whispers, to cries of bellowing elephants as to the silvery buzzing of thegolden fire-fly.Before the soul can comprehend and may remember, she must unto the silentspeaker be united, just as the form to which the clay is modelled is firstunited with the potter's mind.For then the soul will hear, and will remember.And then to the inner ear will speak the voice of the silence.”From THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTORY REMARKS[ix] The Science of Raja Yoga, or the “Kingly Science of the Soul,” as laid downby its main exponent, Patanjali, will eventually find its greatest demonstrationin the West. This is owing to the fact that—under cyclic law—the fifth root race(in its fifth subrace) must inevitably touch its highest point. That point, inthe economy of the races, is seen exemplified in the right use of the mind andits utilisation by the soul for the achievement of group objectives and thedevelopment of group consciousness upon the physical plane.Hitherto the mind has either been prostituted to material ends or has beendeified. Through the science of Raja Yoga, the mind will be known as theinstrument of the soul and the means whereby the brain of the aspirant becomesilluminated and knowledge gained of those matters which concern the realm of thesoul.Under the law of evolution likewise, the mind, being the fifth principle, thefifth root race must be intimately concerned with it, and its correspondingfifth subrace more intimately than any other. Students would do well to bear inmind the following correspondences:1. The fifth root race Aryan. 2. The fifth subrace Anglo-Saxon. 3. The fifthprinciple manas, or mind. 4. The fifth plane the mental. 5. The fifth rayconcrete knowledge[x] All the various Yogas have had their place in the unfoldment of the humanbeing. In the first purely physical race, which is called the Lemurian, the Yogaat that time imposed upon infant humanity was Hatha Yoga, the Yoga of thephysical body, that Yoga which brings into conscious use and manipulation thevarious organs, muscles and parts of the physical frame. The problem before theadepts of that time was to teach human beings, who were then little more thananimals, the purpose, significance and use of their various organs, so that theycould consciously control them, and the meaning of the symbol of the humanfigure. Therefore, in those early days, through the practice of Hatha Yoga, thehuman being reached the portal of initiation. At that time the attainment of thethird initiation, resulting in the transfiguration of the personality, was thehighest initiation that man was capable of achieving.In Atlantean days, the progress of the sons of men was procured through theimposition of two Yogas. First, the Yoga which is called by the name of LayaYoga, the Yoga of the centres which produced a stabilizing of the etheric bodyand of the centres in man and the development of the astral and psychic nature.Later on, Bhakti Yoga, growing out of the development of the emotional or astralbody, was incorporated with Laya Yoga and the foundation of that mysticism anddevotion, which has been the underlying incentive during our particular Aryanroot race, was laid. The fourth initiation was at that time the objective. [xi]The subject of these great initiations has been discussed more at length in myprevious volume, “Initiation, Human and Solar.”Now, in the Aryan race, the subjugation of the mental body and the control ofthe mind is brought about through the practice of Raja Yoga, and the fifthinitiation, that of adept, is the goal for evolving humanity. Thus, all theYogas have had their place and served a useful purpose and it will becomeapparent that any return to Hatha Yoga practices or those practices which dealspecifically with the development of the centres, brought about through varioustypes of meditation practices and breathing exercises, is, from a certainaspect, a retrogression. It will be found that through the practice of RajaYoga, and through assuming that point of directional control which is to befound by the man who centers his consciousness in the soul, the other forms ofYoga are unnecessary, for the greater Yoga automatically includes all the lesserin its results, though not in its practices.When these are studied, it will become apparent why the day of opportunity hasonly just arrived. The East has preserved rules for us since time immemorial.Here and there orientals (with a few Western adepts) have availed themselves ofthose rules and have submitted to the discipline of this exacting science. Thushas been preserved for the race the continuity of the Secret Doctrine, of theAgeless Wisdom, and thus has been gathered together the personnel of theHierarchy of our planet. In the time of the Buddha and [xii] through thestimulation He produced there was a great gathering in of Arhats. These were menwho had achieved liberation through self-initiated effort. This period, in ourAryan race, marked a climax for the East. Since then the tide of spiritual lifehas steadily flowed westward, and we may now look for a corresponding climax inthe West, which will reach its zenith between the years 1965 and 2025. Towardsthis end the adepts of the East and of the West are unitedly working, for theyfollow always the Law.This coming impulse is (as was that in the time of the Buddha) a second Rayimpulse, and has no relation to any first Ray impulse, such as that whichbrought forth H. P. Blavatsky. First Ray impulses rise in the first quarter ofeach century and reach their climax on the physical plane during the lastquarter. The interest now shown in Raja Yoga and the study of this science andthe rules it provides for man's unfoldment, is indicative of the general trendof this rising second Ray impulse. This interest will be increasingly shown.Thus comes the day of opportunity.There are three books which should be in the hands of every student, theBhagavad Gita, the New Testament, and the Yoga Sutras, for in these three iscontained a complete picture of the soul and its unfoldment.In the Gita we have given us (in its eighteen chapters) a description of thesoul, of Krishna, the second aspect, in his true nature as God in manifestation,culminating in that marvellous chapter where he reveals himself to Arjuna, theaspirant, [xiii] as the soul of all things, and the point of glory behind theveil of every form.In the New Testament there is depicted for us the life of a Son of God in fullmanifestation, wherein, freed from every veil, the soul in its true nature walksthe earth. It becomes apparent to us, as we study the life of Christ, what itmeans to develop the powers of the soul, to attain liberation, and become, infull glory, a God walking on earth.In the Yoga Sutras there are embodied for us the laws of that becoming, and therules, methods, and means which—when followed—make a man “perfect even as yourFather in Heaven is perfect.” Step by step there is unfolded for us a gradedsystem of development, leading a man from the stage of average good man, throughthose of aspirant, initiate and master on to that exalted point in evolution atwhich the Christ now stands. John, the beloved disciple, has said that “we shallbe like him, for we shall see him as he is” and the revelation of the soul toman in physical plane incarnation works ever the great transformation. Christhimself has said that “Greater works than I do shall ye do,” holding out to usthe promise of the “kingdom, the power and the glory” provided our aspirationand endurance suffice to carry us along the thorny way of the Cross, and enableus to tread that path which “leads up hill all the way” to the summit of theMount of Transfiguration.How is this great change brought about? How does man, the victim of his desiresand lower [xiv] nature become man, the victor, triumph over the world, the fleshand the devil? It is brought about when the physical brain of the incarnated manbecomes aware of the self, the soul, and this conscious awareness only becomespossible when the true self can “reflect itself in the mind stuff.” The soul isinherently freed from objects and stands ever in the state of isolated unity.Man, however, in incarnation has to arrive, in his physical brain consciousness,at a realization of these two states of being; he has consciously to freehimself from all objects of desire and stand as a unified whole, detached andliberated from all veils, from all forms in the three worlds. When the state ofconscious being, as known by the spiritual man, becomes also the condition ofawareness of the man in physical incarnation then the goal has been reached. Theman is no longer what his physical body makes him, when identified with it, thevictim of the world . He walks free, with shining face (I. Cor. 3) and the lightof his countenance is shed abroad upon all he meets. No longer do his desiresswing the flesh into activity, and no longer does his astral body subjugate himand overcome him.Through dispassion and the balancing of the pairs of opposites he has freedhimself from the moods, feelings, longings, desires, and emotional reactionswhich characterise the life of the average man and has arrived at the point ofpeace. The devil of pride, the personification of the misused mental nature andthe distorted perceptions of the mind, are overcome and he stands liberated [xv]from the three worlds. The nature of the soul, the qualities and activitiesinherent in the love nature of the Son of God, and the wisdom which demonstrateswhen love and activity (the second and third aspects) are brought together,characterise his life on earth, and he can say as did the Christ, “It isfinished.”The date of the birth of Patanjali is unknown and there is a good deal ofcontroversy upon this matter. Most of the occidental authorities ascribe a datebetween the years 820 B. C. to 300 B. C., though one or two place him afterChrist. The Hindu authorities themselves, however, who may be supposed to knowsomething about the matter, ascribe a very much earlier date, even as far backas 10,000 B. C. Patanjali was a compiler of teaching which, up to the time ofhis advent, had been given orally for many centuries. He was the first to reducethe teaching to writing for the use of students and hence he is regarded as thefounder of the Raja Yoga School. The system, however, has been in use since thevery beginning of the Aryan race. The Yoga Sutras are the basic teaching of theTrans-Himalayan School to which many of the Masters of the Wisdom belong, andmany students hold that the Essenes and other schools of mystical training andthought, closely connected with the founder of Christianity and the earlyChristians, are based upon the same system and that their teachers were trainedin the great Trans-Himalayan School.It should be stated here that the Sutras have [xvi] been dictated andparaphrased by the Tibetan Brother and the commentary upon them has been writtenby myself, and subjected to revision and comment by the Tibetan. It should benoted that the translation is not literal, and is not an exact definition ofeach original Sanskrit term. It is an attempt to put into clear andunderstandable English the exact meaning, insofar as it is possible to do sothrough the medium of that non-elastic and unimaginative tongue. The student mayfind it of use in the study of these sutras to compare the rendition here given,with the various other procurable translationsALICE A.

This Union (or Yoga) is achieved through the subjugation of the psychicnature, and the restraint of the chitta (or mind).3. When this has been accomplished, the Yogi knows himself as he is in reality.4. Up till now the inner man has identified himself with his forms and withtheir active modifications.5. The mind states are five, and are subject to pleasure or pain; they arepainful or not painful.6. These modifications (activities) are correct knowledge, incorrect knowledge,fancy, passivity (sleep) and memory.7. The basis of correct knowledge is correct perception, correct deduction, andcorrect witness (or accurate evidence).8. Incorrect knowledge is based upon perception of the form and not upon thestate of being.9. Fancy rests upon images which have no real existence.10. Passivity (sleep) is based upon the quiescent state of the vrittis (or uponthe non-perception of the senses.)11. Memory is the holding on to that which has been known.12. The control of these modifications of the internal organ, the mind, is to bebrought about through tireless endeavour and through non-attachment. [4]13. Tireless endeavour is the constant effort to restrain the modifications ofthe mind.14. When the object to be gained is sufficiently valued, and the efforts towardsits attainment are persistently followed without intermission, then thesteadiness of the mind (restraint of the vrittis) is secured.15. Non-attachment is freedom from longing for all objects of desire, eitherearthly or traditional, either here or hereafter.16. The consummation of this non-attachment results in an exact knowledge of thespiritual man when liberated from the qualities or gunas.17. The consciousness of an object is attained by concentration upon itsfourfold nature: the form, through examination; the quality (or guna), throughdiscriminative participation; the purpose, through inspiration (or bliss); andthe soul, through identification.18. A further stage of samadhi is achieved when, through one pointed thought,the outer activity is quieted. In this stage, the chitta is responsive only tosubjective impressions.19. The samadhi just described passes not beyond the bound of the phenomenalworld; it passes not beyond the Gods, and those concerned with the concreteworld.20. Other yogins achieve samadhi and arrive at a discrimination of pure Spiritthrough belief, followed by energy, memory, meditation and right perception.21. The attainment of this state (spiritual consciousness) is rapid for thosewhose will is intensely alive.22. Those who employ the will likewise differ, for its use may be intense,moderate, or gentle. In respect to the attainment of true spiritualconsciousness there is yet another way.23. By intense devotion to Ishvara, knowledge of Ishvara is gained.24. This Ishvara is the soul, untouched by limitation, free from karma, anddesire.25. In Ishvara, the Gurudeva, the germ of all knowledge expands into infinity.[5]26. Ishvara, the Gurudeva, being unlimited by time conditions, is the teacher ofthe primeval Lords.27. The Word of Ishvara is AUM (or OM). This is the Pranava.28. Through the sounding of the Word and through reflection upon its meaning,the Way is found.29. From this comes the realisation of the Self (the soul) and the removal ofall obstacles.30. The obstacles to soul cognition are bodily disability, mental inertia, wrongquestioning, carelessness, laziness, lack of dispassion, erroneous perception,inability to achieve concentration, failure to hold the meditative attitude whenachieved.31. Pain, despair, misplaced bodily activity and wrong direction (or control) ofthe life currents are the results of the obstacles in the lower psychic nature.32. To overcome the obstacles and their accompaniments, the intense applicationof the will to some one truth (or principle) is required.33. The peace of the chitta (or mind stuff) can be brought about through thepractice of sympathy, tenderness, steadiness of purpose, and dispassion inregard to pleasure or pain, or towards all forms of good or evil.34. The peace of the chitta is also brought about by the regulation of the pranaor life breath.35. The mind can be trained to steadiness through those forms of concentrationwhich have relation to the sense perceptions.36. By meditation upon Light and upon Radiance, knowledge of the Spirit can bereached and thus peace can be achieved.37. The chitta is stabilized and rendered free from illusion as the lower natureis purified and no longer indulged.38. Peace (steadiness of the chitta) can be reached through meditation on theknowledge which dreams give.39. Peace can also be reached through concentration upon that which is dearestto the heart. [6]40. Thus his realization extends from the infinitely small to the infinitelygreat, and from annu (the atom or speck) to atma (or spirit) his knowledge isperfected.41. To him whose vrittis (modifications of the substance of the mind) areentirely controlled, there eventuates a state of identity with, and similarityto that which is realized. The knower, knowledge and the field of knowledgebecome one, just as the crystal takes to itself the colours of that which isreflected in it.42. When the perceiver blends the word, the idea (or meaning) and the object,this is called the mental condition of judicial reasoning.43. Perception without judicial reasoning is arrived at when the memory nolonger holds control, the word and the object are transcended and only the ideais present.44. The same two processes of concentration, with and without judicial action ofthe mind, can be applied also to things subtle.45. The gross leads into the subtle and the subtle leads in progressive stagesto that state of pure spiritual being called Pradhana.46. All this constitutes meditation with seed.47. When this super-contemplative state is reached, the Yogi acquires purespiritual realisation through the balanced quiet of the chitta (or mind stuff).48. His perception is now unfailingly exact (or his mind reveals only theTruth).49. This particular perception is unique and reveals that which the rationalmind (using testimony, inference and deduction) cannot reveal.50. It is hostile to, or supersedes all other impressions.51. When this state of perception is itself also restrained (or superseded),then is pure Samadhi achieved.THE SCIENCE OF UNION - THE HIGHER AND LOWER NATURES DEFINED[7] 1. AUM. (OM) The following instruction concerns the Science of Union.AUM. is the Word of Glory; it signifies the Word made flesh and themanifestation upon the plane of matter of the second aspect of divinity. Thisblazing forth of the sons of righteousness before the world is achieved byfollowing the rules herein contained. When all the sons of men have demonstratedthat they are also Sons of God, the cosmic Son of God will likewise shine forthwith increased intensity of glory. The great initiate, Paul, had a vision ofthis when he said that “the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain . . .waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God.” (Rom. VIII.)Raja Yoga, or the science of Union, gives the rules and the means whereby:1. Conscious contact can be made with the soul, the second aspect, the Christwithin,2. Knowledge of the self can be achieved and its control over the not-selfmaintained, [8]3. The power of the ego or soul can be felt in the daily life and soul powersmanifested,4. The lower psychic nature can be subdued, and the higher psychic facultiesdemonstrated,5. The brain can be brought en rapport with the soul and its messages received,6. The “light in the head” can be increased, so that a man becomes a livingFlame,7. The Path can be found and man himself become that Path.The following triplicities may be found of value to the student, especially ifhe remembers that it is the central column which contains the terms applicableto the soul or second aspect. The union to be achieved is that of the third andsecond aspects. This is consummated at the third initiation (in Christianterminology, the Transfiguration). A later synthesis is then effected betweenthe united third and second aspects and the first:1st Aspect 2nd Aspect 3rd Aspect Spirit Soul Body Father Son (Christ) Holy GhostMonad Ego Personality Divine self Higher self Lower self Life Consciousness FormEnergy Force Matter The Presence The Angel of the Presence The human beingA clear distinction should be made between the Christ Principle as indicatedabove, which is a high spiritual aspect to which each member of humanity mustattain, and the same term applied to a personage of exalted rank representingthat [9] Principle, whether in the historical reference to the Man of Nazarethor otherwise.2. This Union (or Yoga) is achieved through the subjugation of the psychicnature and the restraint of the chitta (or mind).The follower after union has two things to do:1. To gain control of the “versatile psychic nature,”2. To prevent the mind from assuming the many forms it so easily does. These arefrequently called “modifications of the thinking principle.”These two produce control of the emotional body and therefore of desire, andcontrol of the mental body, and therefore of lower manas or mind. The studentshould remember that uncontrolled desire and an unregulated mind shut off thelight of the soul and negate spiritual consciousness. Union is impossible aslong as the barriers exist, and the Master therefore directs the attention ofthe student (at the beginning of his instruction) to the practical work to bedone in liberating this light so that it may “shine forth in a dark place;” i.e., on the physical plane. It should be borne in mind that, occultly speaking,when the lower nature is controlled it can manifest the higher. When the secondaspect of the lower personal self, the emotional body, is subjugated ortransmuted then the Christ light (the second aspect egoic) can be seen. Later,in its light, the Monad, the Father, the One, will stand [10] revealed. Equally,when the first aspect of the lower personal self, the mental body, isrestrained, then the Will aspect of the ego can be known, and through itsactivities, the purpose of the Logos Himself will be cognized.There are certain lines of least resistance in the spiritual life and along themcertain forces or energies are released.a. Emotional intuitional or buddhic monadic to the heart of the aspirant. b.Mental spiritual or atmic logoic to the head of the aspirant.The student is therefore given the WORD of restraint or control as a key to allhis endeavors.The chitta is the mind, or mind-stuff, the mental body, the faculty of thoughtand of thought-form making, the sum total of the mental processes; it is thematerial governed by the ego or soul out of which thought forms are made.The “psychic nature” is kama-manas (desire-mind), the emotional or astral body,tinged faintly with mind, and is the material clothing all our desires andfeelings. Thereby they are expressed.These two types of substance have their own line of evolution to follow and theydo so. Under the logoic plan, the spirits or divine sparks are imprisoned bythem, being first attracted to them through the mutual interplay of spirit andmatter. By the control of these substances and the restraint of theirinstinctual activities, these spirits gain experience and eventually liberation.Thus union with the soul is brought about. It is [11] a union known andexperienced in the physical body upon the plane of densest manifestation throughthe conscious intelligent control of the lower nature.3. When this has been accomplished, the Yogi knows himself as he is in reality.This might be described in the following way: The man who knows the conditionsand has fulfilled them as indicated in the preceding sutra,1. Sees the self,2. Realises the true nature of the soul,3. Identifies himself with the inner Reality, and no longer with the concealingforms,4. Dwells in the centre and no longer upon the periphery,5. Achieves spiritual consciousness,6. Awakes to recognition of the God within. In these three verses, the methodand the goal are described in clear and certain terms and the way prepared forthe more detailed instruction to follow. The aspirant faces his problem, theclue to its solution is given to him, and the reward—union with the soul—is heldbefore his seeking eye.The past is briefly covered in the next verse.4. Up till now the inner man has identified himself with his forms and withtheir active modifications.These forms are the modifications mentioned in the various translations,conveying the subtle [12] truth concerning the infinite divisibility of theatom; these are the veiling sheaths and rapidly changing transformations whichprevent the true nature of the soul becoming manifest. These are theexternalities which hinder the light of the inner God from shining forth, andwhich are occultly spoken of as “casting a shadow before the face of the sun.”The inherent nature of the lives which constitute these active versatile formshas hitherto proved too strong for the soul (the Christ within, as the Christianputs it) and the soul-powers have been prevented full expression. Theinstinctual powers of the “animal soul,” or the capacities of the aggregate oflives which form the sheaths or bodies, imprison the real man and limit hispowers. These lives are intelligent units on the involutionary arc of evolution,working towards self-expression. Their objective is, however, different fromthat of the Inner Man and they hinder his progress and self-realization. Hebecomes “enmeshed in their activities” and must free himself before he comesinto his heritage of power and peace and bliss. He cannot attain “unto themeasure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ” (Eph. 4:13) until thereare no modifications to be felt, until the forms are transformed, theiractivities quieted, and their restlessness stilled.The student is urged to bear in mind the nature of this aspect of evolutionwhich is proceeding concurrently with his own. In his right apprehension of thisproblem comes realization of [13] the practical work to be done, and the embryoyogi can begin his work.The lower forms are constantly and ceaselessly active, endlessly assuming theforms of impulsive desires or dynamic mental thought forms, and it is only asthis “form-taking” is controlled and the tumult of the lower nature stilled thatit becomes possible for the inner ruling entity to liberate himself fromthraldom and impose his vibration upon the lower modifications.This is achieved through concentration—the concentrated effort of the soul tohold steadily the position of observer, or perceiver and of seer. When he can dothis the lower “spectacle” of the rapidly changing forms of thought and desirefades away, and the realm of the soul, the true field of soul knowledge, can beseen and contacted.5. The mind states are five, and are subject to pleasure or pain; they arepainful or not painful.In the original the word “pleasure” does not occur; the thought conveyed is moretechnical, and is usually translated as “not painful.” Nevertheless, theunderlying thought is the hindrance to realization caused by the pairs ofopposites. The student must remember that in this sutra it is the chitta ormind-stuff which is under consideration, with the modifications it undergoes aslong as its versatility and activity are controlling factors. He must not losesight of the fact that we are [14] dealing with the lower psychic nature, whichis the term occultly applied to the lower mind processes as well as to theastral or emotional reactions. All activity in the lower nature is the result ofkama-manas, or of mind tinged with feeling, of the desire-will of the lower man.The goal of the Raja Yoga system is that these impulses should be replaced bythe considered intelligent action of the soul or spiritual man, whose nature islove, whose acts are wise (occultly understood) and whose motive is groupdevelopment. Therefore that reaction called pain must be transcended andlikewise that termed pleasure, for both of these are dependent uponidentification with form. Non-attachment must supersede them.It is interesting to note that the modifications of the internal organ, themind, are five in number. Manas, or mind, the actuating principle of the chitta,or mind-stuff, is the fifth principle, and like all else in nature, manifests asa duality. This duality is:1. Lower concrete mind, demonstrating as the activity of the mental body.2. Abstract mind, demonstrating as the lowest aspect of the ego.In the microcosm, man, this duality becomes a triple modification upon themental plane, and in these three we have in miniature a picture of themacrocosmic manifestation. These three are:1. The mental permanent atom, the lowest aspect of the spiritual Triad or of thesoul,2. The egoic body, the causal body, or the karana sarira, [15]3. The mental body, the highest aspect of the lower personal self.The mental body itself has five modifications or activities, and thus is areflection, or correspondence of the fifth principle, as it manifests upon thefifth plane, the mental. The modifications are the lower shadow of manas (ormind in the microcosmic manifestation), and this mind is a reflection of mahat(the universal mind), or mind manifesting in the macrocosm. This is a greatmystery but will reveal itself to the man who overcomes the five modificationsof the lower mind, who through non-attachment to the lower, identifies himselfwith the higher, and who thus solves the mystery of the “Makara” and treads theWay of the Kumaras. Herein lies a hint to the more advanced students of thisscience as to the esoteric problem of the Makara, hinted at in the “SecretDoctrine” by H. P. Blavatsky.6. These modifications (activities) are correct knowledge, incorrect knowledge,fancy, passivity (sleep) and memory.There exists a vast field of knowledge which the seer must cognise at some timeor another. It is generally conceded among occult psychologists, that there arethree modes of apprehension:1. Direct cognition through the avenue of the senses, each sense, when in use,putting its user into contact with a distinct range of vibrations, demonstratingas form manifestations.2. Deduction or inference , the use by the cogniser of the reasoning powers ofthe mind in relation [16] to that not directly perceived. This is, for theoccult student, the use of the Law of Correspondences or of Analogy.3. The direct cognition of the yogi or seer, centered in the consciousness ofthe self, the ego on its own plane. This is achieved through the right use ofthe mind as an organ of vision and transmission. Patanjali says:“The seer is pure knowledge (gnosis). Though pure he looks upon the presentedidea through the medium of the mind.” Book II. Sutra 20.Deduction is not a sure method of ascertaining knowledge and the othermodifications refer primarily to the wrong use of the image making faculty(imagination), to the self-induced passivity of the mind, a condition ofsemi-trance, and to the retention of thought forms within the mental aura,through the use of the memory. Each of these is now dealt with in a separatesutra by Patanjali.7. The basis of correct knowledge is correct perception, correct deduction andcorrect witness (or accurate evidence).One of the most revolutionary realizations to which the occult student has toadjust himself is the appreciation that the mind is a means whereby knowledge isto be gained. In the west the idea has mostly been held that the mind is thatpart of the human mechanism which utilizes knowledge. The “process of turningthings over in the mind,” of striving to solve problems by hard mental labor hasno part ultimately in the [17] unfoldment of the soul. It is only a preliminarystage and has to be superseded by a different method.The student of Raja Yoga has to realise that the mind is intended to be an organof perception; only thus will he arrive at a right understanding of thisscience. The process to be followed in relation to the mind might be describedsomewhat as follows:1. Right control of the modifications (or activities) of the thinking principle.2. Stabilization of the mind and its subsequent use by the soul as an organ ofvision, a sixth sense, and the synthesis of all the five other senses.Result: Correct knowledge.3. Right use of the perceiving faculty, so that the new field of knowledge whichis now contacted is seen as it is.4. That which is perceived is rightly interpreted through the subsequent assentof the intuition and the reason.5. Right transmission to the physical brain of that which has been perceived;the testimony of the sixth sense is correctly interpreted, and the evidence istransmitted with occult accuracy.Result: Correct reaction of the physical brain to the transmitted knowledge.When the process is studied and followed, the man on the physical plane becomesincreasingly aware of the things of the soul, and the mysteries of the soulrealm—or the “Kingdom of God.” All group concerns and the nature of groupconsciousness are revealed to him. It will be noted [18] that these rules areeven now regarded somewhat as essential premises where all accurate testimony isunder consideration in world affairs. When these same rules are carried forwardinto the world of psychic endeavor (both lower and higher) then we shall have asimplification of the present confusion. In an old book written for disciples ofa certain degree these words occur and are of value to all probationary andaccepted disciples. The translation gives the sense, and is not literal.“Let the one who looks out take care that the window through which he gazestransmits the light of the sun. If he use it in the early dawn (of his endeavor- A.A.B.) let him remember that the orb is not yet risen. The clear cut outlinescannot be perceived, and wraiths and shadows, gloomy spaces and areas full ofdarkness as yet confuse his vision.”At the close of this sentence is found a curious symbol, which conveys to thedisciple’s mind the thought of “Keep silent and reserve your opinion.”8. Incorrect knowledge is based upon perception of the form and not upon thestate of being.This sutra is somewhat difficult to paraphrase. Its significance consists inthis: Knowledge, deduction and a decision which is based upon externals, andupon the form through which any life in any kingdom of nature is expressingitself, is (to the occultist) false and untrue knowledge. [19] At this stage inthe evolutionary process no form of any kind measures up to, or is an adequateexpression of, the indwelling life. No true adept judges any expression ofdivinity through its third aspect. Raja Yoga trains a man to function in hissecond aspect and through that second aspect to put himself en rapport with the“true nature” latent in any form. It is the “being” that is the essentialreality, and all beings are struggling toward true expression. All knowledgetherefore which is acquired through the medium of the lower faculties and whichis based upon the form aspect is incorrect knowledge.The soul alone perceives correctly; the soul alone has the power to contact thegerm or the principle of Buddhi (in the Christian phraseology, the Christprinciple) to be found at the heart of every atom, whether it is the atom ofmatter as studied in the laboratory of the scientist, whether it is the humanatom in the crucible of daily experience, whether it is the planetary atom,within whose ring-pass-not all our kingdoms of nature are found, or the solaratom, God in manifestation through the medium of a solar system. Christ “knewwhat was in man” and therefore could be a Saviour.9. Fancy rests upon images which have no real existence.This means that these images have no real existence in so far as they areconjured up by men themselves, constructed within their own mental auras,energized by their will or desire [20] and are consequently dissipated whenattention is directed elsewhere.“Energy follows thought” is a basic tenet of the Raja Yoga system and is trueeven where these images of fancy are concerned. These fancied images fallprimarily into three groups, which the student would do well to consider.1. Those thought forms which he constructs himself, which have an evanescentlife and which are dependent upon the quality of his desires; being thereforeneither good nor evil, low nor high, can be vitalized by low tendencies oridealistic aspirations, with all the intermediate stages to be found betweenthese extremes. The aspirant has to guard himself in order that he may notmistake these for reality. An illustration might well be given here, in respectto the facility with which people judge they have seen one of the Brothers (orMasters of the Wisdom), whereas all they have perceived is a thought form of oneof Them; the wish being father to the thought they are the victim of that formof incorrect perception called by Patanjali, fancy.2. Those thought forms which are created by the race, the nation, the group orthe organization. Group thought forms of any kind (from the planetary form tothat constructed by any band of thinkers) form the sum total of the “greatillusion.” Herein lies a hint to the earnest aspirant.3. That thought form created by a man since his first appearance in physicalform, and called the “Dweller on the Threshold.” Being created [21] by the lowerpersonal self and not by the soul, it is impermanent and is simply held togetherby the man’s lower energy. When the man begins to function as the soul this“image” he has created, through his “fancy” or his reaction to delusion, isdissipated by a supreme exertion. It has no real existence once there is nothingin the aspirant to feed it, and the realization of this enables him to freehimself from its thraldom.This is one of the sutras which, though apparently short and simple, is of themost profound significance; it is studied by high initiates who are learning thenature of the creative process of the planet, and who are concerned with thedissipation of planetary maya.10. Passivity (sleep) is based upon the quiescent state of the vrittis (or uponthe non-perception of the senses).Some explanation as to the nature of the vrittis is perhaps necessary here. Thevrittis are those activities of the mind which eventuate in the consciousrelation between the sense employed and that which is sensed. Apart from acertain modification of the mental process or an assertion of the I-am-Irealization, the senses might be active yet the man be unaware of them. The manis aware that he sees, tastes or hears; he says, “I see, I taste, I hear,” andit is the activity of the vrittis (or those mental perceptions which haverelation to the five senses) which enables him to recognize the fact. Bywithdrawing himself from active sense perception, by no longer [22] utilisingthe “outward-going” consciousness, and by abstracting that consciousness fromthe periphery to the centre, he can bring on a condition of passivity,—a lack ofawareness, which is not the samadhi of the yogi, nor the achievement ofone-pointedness such as the student of yoga aspires to, but which is a form oftrance. This self-imposed quieting is not only a detriment to the achievement ofthe highest yoga but is excessively dangerous in many cases.Students will do well to remember that right activity of the mind and itscorrect use is the goal of yoga, and that the state called “a blank mind” and acondition of passive receptivity, with the sense relations cut off or atrophied,is not part of the process. The sleep here referred to is not the passing of thebody into the state of slumber, but the putting to sleep of the vrittis. It isthe negation of the contacts of the senses without the sixth sense, the mind,superseding their activities. In this condition of sleep, a man is open tohallucination, to delusion, to wrong impressions and to obsessions.Sleep is of several kinds, and only a short tabulation is possible in such acommentary as this is.1. The ordinary sleep of the physical body, where the brain does not respond toany sense contacts;2. Sleep of the vrittis, or of those modifications of the mental processes whichcorrelate the man with his environment, through the medium of the senses and themind; [23]3. The sleep of the soul, which, occultly speaking, covers that part of humanexperience which dates from a man’s first human incarnation until he “awakens”to a knowledge of the plan, and endeavors to bring the lower man into line withthe nature and will of the inner spiritual man;4. The sleep of the ordinary medium, wherein the etheric body is partiallyextruded from the physical body, and is likewise separated from the astral body,bringing in a condition of very real danger;5. Samadhi, or the sleep of the yogi, the result of the conscious scientificwithdrawal of the real man from his lower threefold sheath in order to work onhigh levels, preparatory to some active service upon the lower;6. The sleep of the Nirmanakayas, which is a condition of such intense spiritualconcentration and focussing in the spiritual or atmic body that the outwardgoing consciousness is withdrawn not only from the three planes of humanendeavor but likewise from the two lower expressions of the spiritual Triad. Forpurposes of his peculiar and specific work the Nirmanakaya “sleeps” to allstates save that of the third, or atmic plane.11. Memory is the holding on to that which has been known.This memory concerns several groups of realizations, either active or latent; itdeals with certain congeries of known factors, and these might be enumerated asfollows:1. The thought images of that which is tangible, [24] objective and which hasbeen known by the thinker upon the physical plane.2. Kama-manasic (or desire-lower mind) images of past desires and theirgratification. The “picture making faculty” of the average man is based upon hisdesires (high or low desires, aspirational or degrading, in its sense of pullingdown) and their known gratification. This remains equally true of the memory ofa gluttonous man, for instance, and his latent image of a satisfactory dinner,and the memory of the orthodox saint, based upon his picture making of a joyousheaven.3. That memory activity which is the result of mental training, the accumulationof acquired facts, the consequence of reading or of teaching, and which is notpurely based upon desire, but which has its basis in intellectual interest.4. All the various contacts which the memory holds and recognises as emanatingfrom the five lower sense perceptions.5. Those mental images, latent in the memory making faculty, which are the totalof the knowledge contacted and the realisations evoked by the right use of themind as a sixth sense.All these forms of the memory faculty have to be dropped and no longer held;they must be recognised as modifications of the mind, of the thinking principle,and therefore as part of that versatile psychic nature which has to be dominatedbefore the yogi can hope to attain liberation from limitation and from all loweractivity. This is the goal. [25]6. Finally (for it is not necessary to enumerate more intricate subdivisions)memory includes also the accumulated experiences gained by the soul through themany incarnations, and stored up in the true consciousness of the soul.12. The control of these modifications of the internal organ, the mind, is to bebrought about through tireless endeavour and through non-attachment.A few brief explanations are all that is necessary with a sutra as easy toapprehend as this one; intellectually its meaning is clear; in practice,however, it is difficult to carry out.1. The internal organ is of course the mind. Occidental thinkers should rememberthat the Eastern occultist does not consider the organs to be the physicalorgans. The reason for this is that the physical body in its dense or concreteform is not regarded as a principle, but simply as the tangible outcome of theactivity of the real principles. The organs, occultly speaking, are such centresof activity as the mind, the various permanent atoms, and the centres of forcein the various sheaths. These all have their objective “shadows” or results, andthese resultant emanations are the external physical organs. The brain, forinstance, is the “shadow” or the external organ of the mind, and it will befound by the investigator that the contents of the brain cavity have acorrespondence to the aspects of the human mechanism found upon the mentalplane. This latter sentence should be emphasised; [26] it conveys a hint tothose capable of taking advantage of it.2. Tireless endeavour means literally constant practice, ceaseless repetitionand the reiterated effort to impose the new rhythm upon the old, and to effacedeep seated habits and modifications by the institution of soul impression. Theyogi or Master is the result of patient endurance; his achievement is the fruitof a steady effort which is based upon intelligent appreciation of the work tobe done and the goal to be reached, and not upon spasmodic enthusiasm.3. Non-attachment is the one thing that eventually brings all sense perceptionsto perform their legitimate functions. Through non-attachment to those forms ofknowledge with which the senses put a man in contact, they continuously losetheir hold over him; the time eventually comes when he is liberated, and is themaster of his senses and of all sense contacts. This does not involve a statewherein they are atrophied and useless, but is one in which they are useful tothe yogi when and as he chooses and in so far as he chooses; they are utilizedby him in increasing his efficiency in group service and in group endeavour.13. Tireless endeavour is the constant effort to restrain the modifications ofthe mind.This is one of the most difficult sutras to translate so as to give its realsignificance. The idea involved is that of the constant effort made by thespiritual man to restrain the modifications or [27] the fluctuations of the mindand to control the lower psychic versatile nature in order fully to express hisown spiritual nature. Thus, and only thus, can the spiritual man live the lifeof the soul each day upon the physical plane. Charles Johnston in histranslation seeks to give this meaning in the words “the right use of the willis the steady effort to stand in spiritual being.”The idea involved is that of applying to the mind (regarded as a sixth sense)the same restraint that the five lower senses are subjected to: their outwardgoing activities are stopped and they are held from responding to the pull orattraction of their particular field of knowledge.14. When the object to be gained is sufficiently valued, and the efforts towardsits attainment are persistently followed without intermission, then thesteadiness of the mind (restraint of the vrittis) is secured.All followers of Raja Yoga must first be devotees. Only intense love of the souland of all that knowledge of the soul entails will carry the aspirant withsufficient steadiness toward his goal. The objective in view—union with thesoul, and consequently with the Oversoul and with all souls—must be justlyappraised; the reasons for its achievement correctly judged, and the results tobe gained most earnestly desired (or loved) before the aspirant will make thatsufficiently strong effort which will give him his hold upon the modificationsof the mind and consequently upon his [28] entire lower nature. When thisappreciation is true enough and his ability to go forward with the work ofsubjugation and control is without intermission, then the time will come whenthe student will know consciously and increasingly what is the meaning ofrestraint of the modifications.15. Non-attachment is freedom from longing for all objects of desire, eitherearthly or traditional, either here or hereafter.Non-attachment can also be described as thirstlessness. This is the most correctoccult term to use as it involves the dual idea of water, the symbol of materialexistence, and desire, the quality of the astral plane, whose symbol is alsowater. The idea of man being the “fish” is curiously complete here. This symbol(as is the case with all symbols) has seven meanings; two are of use in thisplace:1. The fish is the symbol of the Vishnu aspect, the Christ principle, the secondaspect of divinity, the Christ in incarnation, whether it is the cosmic Christ(expressing Himself through a solar system) or the individual Christ thepotential saviour within each human being. This is the “Christ in you, the hopeof glory.” (Col. I:27) If the student will also study the fish Avatar of Vishnuhe will learn still more.2. The fish swimming in the waters of matter, an extension of the same idea onlycarried down to its more obvious present expression, man as the personality.[29] Where there is no longing for any object whatsoever, and where there is nodesire for rebirth (ever the outcome of longing for “form-expression” ormaterial manifestation) then the true thirstlessness is attained, and theliberated man turns his back upon all the forms in the lower three worlds andbecomes a true saviour.In the Bhagavad Gita the following illuminating words are found:—“For the possessors of wisdom, united in soul-vision, giving up the fruit ofworks, freed from the bondage of rebirth, reach the home where no sorrow dwells.“When thy soul shall pass beyond the forest of delusion, thou shalt no moreregard what shall be taught or what has been taught.“When withdrawn from traditional teaching, thy soul shall stand steadfast, firmin soul-vision, then shalt thou gain union with the Soul.” (Gita II, 51, 52 and53.)J. H. Woods makes this clear in his translation of the comment by Veda Vyasawhich is here appended:“Passionless is the consciousness of being Master on the part of one who has ridhimself of thirst for either seen or revealed objects.”“The mind stuff (chitta)—if it be rid of thirst for objects that are seen, suchas women, or food or drink or power, if it be rid of thirst for the objectrevealed (in the Vedas) such as the attainment of Heaven or of the discarnatestate or of resolution into primary matter—if even when in contact with objectseither supernormal or not, it be, by virtue of elevation, aware of theinadequateness of objects—will have a consciousness of being Master...”[30] The word “traditional” carries the student’s thought away from that whichis usually regarded as the object of sensuous perception into the world ofthought forms, into that “forest of delusion” which is constructed of men’sideas about God, heaven or hell. The sublimation of all this and its highestexpression in the three worlds is that “devachan” which is the goal of themajority of the sons of men. Devachanic experience must, however, be transformedeventually into nirvanic realization. It may be of value to the student toremember that heaven, the object of aspirational desire, which is the outcome oftraditional teaching, and of all formulations of doctrinal faiths has severalmeanings to the occultist. For the purpose of a clearer understanding thefollowing may be found to be of use:1. Heaven , that state of consciousness upon the astral plane which is theconcretion of the longing and desire of the aspirant for rest, peace andhappiness. It is based upon the “forms of joy.” It is a condition of sensuousenjoyment, and being constructed for himself by each individual is as varied asthere are people participating in it. Non-attachment has to be achieved withrespect to heaven. It is realized as enjoyed by the lower self, and by the manwhen bereft only of his physical body, prior to passing out of the astral bodyon to the mental plane.2. Devachan , that state of consciousness upon the mental plane into which thesoul passes when deprived of its astral body and functioning in, or limited by,its mental body. It is of a higher [31] order than the ordinary heaven and thebliss enjoyed is more mental than we ordinarily understand by the word, yetnevertheless it is still within the lower world of form and will be transcendedwhen non-attachment is known.3. Nirvana , that condition into which the adept passes when the three lowerworlds are no longer “attached” to him through his inclinations or karma, andwhich he experiences after he has:a. Taken certain initiations,b. Freed himself from the three worlds,c. Organized his Christ body.Strictly speaking those adepts who have achieved non-attachment but who havechosen to sacrifice themselves and abide with the sons of men in order to serveand help them are not technically Nirvanis. They are Lords of Compassion pledgedto “suffer” with, and to be governed by, certain conditions analogous to (thoughnot identical with) the conditions governing men who are still attached to theworld of form.16. The consummation of this non-attachment results in an exact knowledge of thespiritual man when liberated from the qualities or gunas.Certain points should be remembered by the student when considering this sutra:1. That the spiritual man is the monad,2. That the evolutionary process when carried to its climax produces not onlythe freeing of the soul from the limitations of the three worlds, but thefreeing of the spiritual man from [32 ] all limitations, even that of the soulitself. The goal is formlessness or freedom from objective and tangiblemanifestation, and the true significance of this becomes apparent as the studentremembers the oneness of spirit and matter when in manifestation; i.e. our sevenplanes are the seven subplanes of the lowest cosmic plane, the physical.Consequently only “the time of the end” and the dissolution of a solar systemwill reveal the true meaning of formlessness.3. The gunas are the three qualities of matter, the three effects produced whenmacrocosmic energy, the life of God which persists independently of form-taking,actuates or energizes substance. The three gunas are:1. Sattva Energy of Spirit Monad Father rhythm or harmonious vibration 2. RajasEnergy of Soul Ego Son mobility or activity 3. Tamas Energy of MatterPersonality Holy Ghost inertia.These three correspond to the quality of each of the three aspects which expressthe one Life.In such a brief commentary as this perforce must be it is not possible toenlarge to any extent upon this subject, but some idea can be gained as to whatis meant by the consummation of non-attachment when applied to the macrocosm orthe microcosm. The three gunas have all been used, full experience through theuse of form has been acquired, consciousness, perception or awareness throughattachment to an object or to a form has been developed, all resources have beenutilised, [33] and the spiritual man (logoic or human) has no further use orneed for them. He is therefore freed from the gunas, released from form takingas the result of attachment, and enters into a new state of consciousness uponwhich it is useless for us to speculate.17. The consciousness of an object is attained by concentration on its fourfoldnature: the form, through examination; the quality (or guna), throughdiscriminative participation; the purpose, through inspiration (or bliss) andthe soul, through identification.It will be apparent therefore that the statement “as a man thinketh so is he”(Prov. 23:7) is based on occult facts. Every form of any kind has a soul, andthat soul or conscious principle is identical with that in the human form;identical in its nature though not in its scope of development, or its degree.This is equally true of the great Lives or superhuman Existences in which manhimself “lives and moves and has his being” (Acts 17:28) and to Whose state ofdevelopment he aspires.As the aspirant chooses with care the “objects” upon which he will meditate, hethrough these objects, builds himself a ladder by means of which he arriveseventually at the objectless. As his mind assumes increasingly the meditativeattitude of the soul, the brain becomes also increasingly subjugated to the mindas the mind is to the soul. Thus is the lower man gradually identified with thespiritual man who is omniscient [34] and omnipresent. This meditative attitudeis assumed through a fourfold process:—1. Meditation on the nature of a particular form, realising, as the form ispondered upon, that it is but a symbol of an inner reality, our whole tangibleobjective world being built up of form, of some kind (human, subhuman andsuperhuman), which expresses the life of hosts of sentient beings.2. Meditation upon the quality of any particular form, so that an appreciationof its subjective energy may be gained. It should be borne in mind that theenergy of an object may be regarded as the colour of that object, and hence thewords of Patanjali IV, 17 become illuminating in this connection and serve as acommentary upon this second point. This is called “discriminativeparticipation,” and through it the student arrives at that knowledge of energyin himself which is one with the object of his meditation.3. Meditation upon the purpose of any particular form. This involvesconsideration of the idea back of or underlying any form manifestation and itsdisplay of energy. This realisation carries the aspirant onward to a knowledgeof that part in the plan or purpose of the All which is the motivating factor inthe form’s activity. Thus through the part, the Whole is contacted and anexpansion of consciousness takes place, involving bliss or joy. Beatitude alwaysfollows upon realisation of the unity of the part with the Whole. Frommeditation upon the tattvas, the energies or principles, or upon the tanmatrasor [35] elements composing spirit-matter, a knowledge of the purpose or plan forthe microcosmic or macrocosmic manifestations eventuates and with this knowledgecomes bliss.In these three are to be found correspondences to the three aspects, spirit,soul and body, and an illuminating study for the earnest student.4. Meditation upon the soul, upon the One who uses the form, who energises itinto activity and who is working in line with the plan. This soul, being onewith all souls and with the Oversoul subserves the one plan and isgroup-conscious.Thus through these four stages of meditation upon an object, the aspirantarrives at his goal, knowledge of the soul, and of the soul powers. He becomesconsciously identified with the one reality, and this in his physical brain. Hefinds that truth which is himself and which is the truth hidden in every formand in every kingdom of nature. Thus he will eventually arrive (when knowledgeof the soul itself is gained) at a knowledge of the All-Soul and become one withit.18. A further stage of samadhi is achieved when through one-pointed thought, theouter activity is quieted. In this stage the chitta is responsive only tosubjective impressions.The word “samadhi” is subject to various interpretations, and is applied todifferent stages of yogi achievement. This makes it somewhat difficult for theaverage student when studying the various commentaries. Perhaps one of theeasiest ways to realise its meaning is to remember that [36] the word “Sama” hasreference to the faculty of the mind-stuff (or chitta) to take form or to modifyitself according to the external impressions. These external impressions reachthe mind via the senses. When the aspirant to yoga can control his organs ofsense-perception so that they no longer telegraph to the mind their reactions tothat which is perceived, two things are brought about:a. The physical brain becomes quiet and still,b. The mind stuff or the mental body, the chitta, ceases to assume the variousmodifications and becomes equally still.This is one of the early stages of samadhi but is not the samadhi of the adept.It is a condition of intense internal activity instead of external; it is anattitude of one-pointed concentration. The aspirant is, however, responsive toimpressions from the subtler realms and to modifications arising from thoseperceptions which are still more subjective. He becomes aware of a new field ofknowledge, though as yet he knows not what it is. He ascertains that there is aworld which cannot be known through the medium of the five senses but which theright use of the organ of the mind will reveal. He gets a perception of what maylie back of the words found in a later sutra as translated by Charles Johnston,which expresses this thought in particularly clear terms:“The seer is pure vision . . . he looks out through the vesture of the mind.”(Book II. Sutra 20.)The preceding sutra dealt with what may be [37] called meditation with seed orwith an object; this sutra suggests the next stage, meditation without seed orwithout that which the physical brain would recognise as an object.It might be of value here if the six stages of meditation dealt with byPatanjali are mentioned as they give a clue to the entire process of unfoldmentdealt with in this book:1. Aspiration,2. Concentration,3. Meditation,4. Contemplation,5. Illumination,6. Inspiration.It is of value here to note that the student begins by aspiring to that whichlies beyond his ken and ends by being inspired by that which he has sought toknow. Concentration (or intense focussing) results in meditation and meditationflowers forth as contemplation.19. The samadhi just described passes not beyond the bounds of the phenomenalworld; it passes not beyond the Gods and those concerned with the concreteworld.It should be noted here that the results achieved in the processes dealt with insutras seventeen and eighteen only carry the aspirant to the edge of the realmof the soul, to the new field of knowledge of which he has become aware. He isstill confined to the three worlds. All that he has succeeded in doing isstilling the modifications of [38] the mental body so that for the first timethe man (on the physical plane and in his physical brain) becomes cognisant ofwhat lies beyond those three worlds—that is, the soul, its range of vision andits knowledge. He has yet to strengthen his link with the soul (dealt with insutras twenty-three to twenty-eight) and then having transferred hisconsciousness into that of the real or spiritual man, he must begin working fromthat new stand-point or vantage point.The idea has been expressed by some translators as the condition in which theaspirant becomes aware “of the rain cloud of knowable things.” The raincloud hasnot precipitated sufficiently for the rain to fall from heavenly heights ontothe physical plane or for the “knowable things” to become known to the physicalbrain. The cloud is perceived as the result of intense concentration and thestilling of the lower modifications, but until the soul or Master has assumedcontrol the knowledge of the soul cannot be poured into the physical brain viathe sixth sense, the mind.The science of yoga is a real science and only as students approach it by thecorrect stages and employ the scientific methods, will the true samadhi orrealization be achieved.20. Other yogins achieve samadhi and arrive at a discrimination of pure spiritthrough belief, followed by energy, memory, meditation and right perception.In the previous groups of yogins dealt with, perception was limited to thephenomenal world, [39] though we must understand by that only the three worldsof mental perception, astral perception and of the physical senses. The energiesproducing concretion and the motive power of thought as it produces effects onthe physical plane are contacted and known. Here however the yogin translateshimself into more spiritual and subtler realms and becomes aware of that whichthe self (in its true nature) perceives and knows. He enters into the world ofcauses. The first group might be regarded as comprising all who are treading thepath of discipleship, and covers the time from their entrance upon theProbationary Path until they have taken the second Initiation. The second groupis comprised of those higher disciples who—having controlled and transmuted theentire lower nature—make a contact with their monad, spirit or “Father inHeaven” and discern what that monad perceives.The first form of realisation comes to those who are in process of synthesisingthe six lower centres into the head centre, through the transmutation of thelower four into the higher three, and then of the heart and throat into thehead. The second group—through a knowledge of the law—works with all thetransmuted and purified centres. They know how to achieve the real samadhi orstate of occult abstraction through their ability to withdraw the energies intothe thousand petalled lotus of the head, and from thence to abstract themthrough the other two subtler bodies until all is centred and focussed in thecausal vehicle, the karana sarira, the egoic lotus. We are told by [40]Patanjali that this is produced by the following five stages. Students shouldbear in mind that these stages relate to soul activities, to egoic realisationand not to the reactions of the lower man and the physical brain.1. Belief . On his own plane the soul rehearses a condition analogous to thebelief of the aspirant in the soul or Christ aspect, only in this case theobjective is the realisation of that which the Christ or soul is seeking toreveal, the spirit or Father in Heaven. First the disciple arrives at arealisation of the angel of His Presence, the solar angel, ego or soul. This isthe achievement of the previous group. Then the Presence itself is latercontacted and that Presence is pure spirit, the absolute, the Father of Being.The self and the not-self have been known by this group of initiates. Now thevision of the not-self dims and passes away and only spirit is known. Beliefmust ever be the first stage. First the theory, then the experiment, and lastlyrealisation.2. Energy . When the theory is grasped, when the goal is perceived, thenactivity ensues—that right activity and that correct use of force which willbring the goal nearer and make theory fact.3. Memory , or right mindfulness. This is an interesting factor in the processas it involves right forgetfulness, or the elimination out of the consciousnessof the ego of all those forms which have hitherto veiled the Real. These formsare either self-chosen or self-created. This leads to a condition of trueapprehension or the ability to register correctly that which the soul hasperceived, [41] and the power to transfer that correct perception to the brainof the physical man. This is the memory referred to here. It does not refer sospecifically to recollection of the things of the past, but covers the point ofrealisation and the transference of that realisation to the brain where it mustbe registered and eventually recollected at will.4. Meditation . That which has been seen and registered in the brain and whichhas emanated from the soul must be meditated upon and thus woven into the fabricof the life. It is through this meditation that the soul-perceptions become realto the man upon the physical plane. This meditation therefore is of a very highorder as it follows upon the contemplative stage and is soul-meditation with theobject of illuminating the vehicle upon the physical plane.5. Right perception. The experience of the soul, and the knowledge of the spiritor Father aspect begins to form part of the brain content of the Adept orMaster. He knows the plan as it is to be found on the highest levels and is intouch with the Archetype. It is, if I might illustrate in this way, that thisclass of yogins have reached the point where they can perceive the plan as itexists in the mind of the “Grand Architect of the Universe.” They are now enrapport with Him. In the other class of Yogins, the point reached is that inwhich they are able to study the blue-prints of the great plan and thus canintelligently co-operate in the building of the Temple of the Lord. Theperception referred to here is of such a high [42] order as to be almostinconceivable to any but advanced disciples, but in an appreciation of thestages and grades there comes to the aspirant, not only an understanding of whatis his immediate problem and of where he stands, but also an appreciation of thebeauty of the entire scheme.21. The attainment of this stage (spiritual consciousness) is rapid for thosewhose will is intensely alive.This would naturally be so. As the will, reflected in the mind, becomes dominantin the disciple, he has awakened that aspect of himself which is en rapport withthe will aspect of the Logos, the first or Father aspect. The lines of contactare as follows:1. Monad or the Father in Heaven, the will aspect,2. Atma or spiritual will, the highest aspect of the soul,3. The mental body or intelligent Will, the highest aspect of the personality,4. The head centre.This is the line followed by the raja-yogins and it brings them to a realisationof the spirit and to adeptship. There is yet another line:1. Monad,2. The Son or Christ aspect,3. The love aspect, or wisdom aspect,4. Buddhi or spiritual love, the second aspect of the soul,5. The emotional body, the second aspect of the personality, [43]6. The heart centre.This is the line followed by the bhakti, the devotee and the saint and bringshim to a knowledge of the soul and of sainthood. The former line is that to befollowed by our Aryan race. This second line was the path of attainment for theAtlanteans.If students would follow these tabulations with care much light would come. Thenecessity for a strong energetic will becomes apparent if the path of Initiationis studied. Only an iron will, and a steady, strong, unswerving endurance willcarry the aspirant along this path and out into the clear light of day.22. Those who employ the will likewise differ, for its use may be intense,moderate or gentle. In respect to the attainment of true spiritual consciousnessthere is yet another way.It would be wise here to make clear the two ways whereby men reach thegoal,—knowledge of the spiritual life, and emancipation. There is the way ofYoga as outlined by Patanjali whereby, through the use of the will,discrimination between the self and the not-self is achieved and pure spirit isarrived at. This is the way for the fifth or Aryan race, for those whosefunction it is to develop the fifth principle or mind and thus become true sonsof mind. It is their part to become the five-pointed star, the star of theperfected man, in all his glory. Through following this way the five planes ofhuman and superhuman evolution are dominated and atma (or the [44] will of God,the Father aspect) stands revealed through the medium of buddhi (or the Christconsciousness), having for its vehicle, manas or higher mind.The other way is the way of pure devotion. Through intense adoration and entireconsecration the aspirant arrives at a knowledge of the reality of spirit. Thisis the way of least resistance for many; it was the method of attainment for therace preceding the Aryan. It largely ignores the fifth principle and is thesublimation of sensuous perception, being the way of intense feeling. Throughfollowing this method the four planes are dominated and buddhi (or the Christ)stands revealed. Students should differentiate clearly between these two ways,remembering that the white occultist blends the two and if in this life hefollows the way of Raja Yoga with fervour and love it will be because in otherlives he set his foot upon the way of devotion and found the Christ, the Buddhiwithin. In this life he will recapitulate his experience, plus the intenseexercise of the will and control of the mind which will eventually reveal to himhis Father in Heaven, the point of pure spirit.Commentators upon this sutra point out that those who follow the method of RajaYoga and use the will are divided into three main groups. These cancorrespondingly be divided into nine. There are those who use the will with suchintensity that exceedingly rapid results are achieved, attended however withcertain dangers and risks. There is the risk of uneven development, [45] of anegation of the heart side of nature, and of certain destructions which willlater have to be remedied. Then there are those aspirants whose progress is lessrapid, and who are exponents of the middle path. They proceed steadily andmoderately and are called the “discriminative adepts” as they permit no excessesof any kind. Their method is to be recommended to men in this particular cycle.Again there are those gentle souls whose will may be regarded as characterisedby an imperturbable pertinacity and who go steadily, undeviatingly forward,eventually arriving at their goal. They are distinguished by intense tenacity.Their progress is slow. They are the “tortoises” of the Path just as the firstgroup are the “hares.”In some of the old books there are detailed accounts of these three groups ofaspirants and they are portrayed under three symbols:1. The intense group are depicted as goats , and aspirants of this type arefrequently found in incarnation under the sign Capricorn,2. The moderate group are depicted by a fish , and many born under the signPisces are found in this category,3. The gentle or slow group are pictured as crabs and often come intoincarnation under the sign Cancer.In these three groups are to be found various subdivisions and it is interestingto note that in the archives of the Lords of Karma, the majority of these threegroups pass into the sign of Libra (or the balances) towards the close of theirendeavour. [46] When in incarnation under this sign they balance the pairs ofopposites with care, they equalise their one-sided development, modifying theunevenness of their efforts hitherto, and begin to “set an even pace.” Theyfrequently then enter the sign of Aquarius and become bearers of water, havingto carry “on their heads the bowl of living water.” Thus the rapidity of theirclimb up the mount of initiation has to be modified, or “the water will be spiltand the bowl be shattered.” Because the water is intended to slake the thirst ofthe masses, they must hasten their progress for the need is great. Thus the“first shall be last and the last shall be first” and the hare and the tortoisemeet at the goal.23. By intense devotion to Ishvara, knowledge of Ishvara is gained.Ishvara is the son in manifestation through the sun. This is the macrocosmicaspect. Ishvara is the son of God, the cosmic Christ, resplendent in the heartof each of us. The word “heart” is here used in its occult connotation. Thefollowing correspondences may be found illuminating and should be studied withcare.Aspect Quality Centre Macrocosm Spirit Father Monad Will Head Central spiritualsun. Soul Son Ego Love Heart Heart of the sun. Body Holy Spirit PersonalityActive Intelligence Throat Physical sun.Ishvara is the second aspect, and therefore the [47] real meaning of this sutrais that through intense devotion to, and love of Ishvara, the Christ inmanifestation, that Christ or soul may be contacted or known. Ishvara is God inthe heart of every child of God; He is to be found in the cave of the heart; Heis to be reached through pure love and devoted service, and when reached He willbe seen seated upon the twelve petalled lotus of the heart, holding in his handsthe “jewel in the lotus.” Thus the devotee finds Ishvara. When the devoteebecomes the raja yogin then Ishvara will reveal to him the secret of the jewel.When Christ is known as king upon the throne of the heart, then He will revealthe Father to His devotee. But the devotee has to tread the Path of Raja Yoga,and combine intellectual knowledge, mental control and discipline before therevelation can be truly made. The mystic must eventually become the occultist:the head qualities and the heart qualities must be equally developed, for bothare equally divine.24. This Ishvara is the Soul, untouched by limitation, free from karma anddesire.Here we have the picture of the spiritual man as he is in reality. His relationto the three worlds is shown. This is the state of the master or the adept, ofthe soul who has come into its birthright, and is no longer under control of theforces and energies of the lower nature. There is given in this and thefollowing three sutras, a picture of the liberated man who has passed throughthe cycle of incarnation and through [48] struggle and experience has found thetrue self. Here is depicted the nature of the solar angel, the son of God, theego or the higher self. He is stated to be1. Untouched by limitation. He is no longer “cribbed, cabined and confined” bythe lower quaternary. He is no longer crucified upon the cross of matter. Thefour lower sheaths—dense, etheric, emotional and mental—are no longer hisprison. They are but instruments which he can use or vacate at will. His willfunctions freely and if he stays within the realm of the three worlds, it is ofhis own choice, and his self-imposed limitation can be terminated at will. He ismaster in the three worlds, a son of God dominating and controlling the lowercreations.2. Free from Karma. Through knowledge of the law he has adjusted all his karma,paid all his debts, cancelled all his obligations, settled all claims againsthim, and through his subjective realisation has entered consciously into theworld of causes. The world of effects is left behind, in so far as the threeworlds are concerned. Thus he no longer (blindly and through ignorance) sets inmotion conditions which must produce evil effects. He works ever with the lawand every demonstration of energy (the spoken word and the initiated action) isundertaken with a full knowledge of the result to be attained. Thus nothing hedoes produces evil results and no karma is thereby entailed. Average men dealwith effects and blindly work their way through them. The Master deals withcauses, and the effects He [49] produces, through the wielding of the law, donot limit or hold him.3. Free from desire. No longer do the things of sensuous perception on any ofthe three planes attract or allure Him. His consciousness is inward and upward.It is no longer downward and outgoing. He is at the centre and the periphery nolonger attracts him. The longing for experience, the craving for physical planeexistence, and the desire for the form aspect in its many variations has for himno appeal. He has experienced, He knows, He has suffered, and He has been forcedinto incarnation through His longing for the not-self. Now all that is ended andHe is the freed soul.25. In Ishvara, the Gurudeva, the germ of all knowledge expands into infinity.In the macrocosmic sense God is the Master of all and He is the sum total ofomniscience, being (as is easily seen) the sum total of all states ofconsciousness. He is the soul of all things, and the soul of the atom of matteras well as the souls of men are a part of His infinite realisation. The soul ofthe human being is potentially the same, and as soon as the consciousness ceasesto identify itself with its vehicles or organs, the germ of all knowledge beginsto expand. In the disciple, the adept, Master or Mahatma, in the Christ, theBuddha, and in the Lord of the World, Who is mentioned in the Bible as theAncient of Days, this “germ of all knowledge” can be seen at differing stages ofunfoldment. God consciousness [50] is theirs, and they pass from one initiationto another. At each stage a man is a master but ever beyond the point attainedanother possible expansion becomes apparent and ever the process is the same.This process may be summed up in the following statements:1. An urge, or determination to achieve the new knowledge,2. The holding of the consciousness already unfolded and its utilisation, andfrom the point achieved working forward towards further realisation,3. The overcoming of the difficulties incident to the limitations of thevehicles of consciousness and to karma,4. The occult tests which are imposed upon the pupil when he shows ability,5. The triumph of the pupil,6. The recognition of his triumph and attainment by the guides of the race, theplanetary Hierarchy,7. The vision of what lies ahead.Thus does the unfoldment proceed and in each cycle of endeavor the evolving sonof God comes into his birthright and takes the position of a knower, “One whohas heard the tradition, experienced the dissolution of that hitherto held, seenthat which is hidden from those who abide by the tradition, substituted thatwhich is newly seen, donated the acquired possession to those who hold out emptyhands, and passed on to inner halls of learning.” Students would do well instudying these few [51] sutras relating to Ishvara to bear in mind that theyhave reference to the son of God, the second person of the Trinity as Hemanifests through the medium of the solar system, to the macrocosmic soul. Thesecondary meaning has reference also to the divine son of God, the second aspectmonadic, as He manifests through the medium of a human being. This is themicrocosmic soul. The following synonyms of the Ishvara aspect may be found ofvalue.The MacrocosmIshvara, the second aspect Whose nature is love. The Son of God The revealer ofthe Father. The cosmic Christ God in incarnation. Vishnu Second person of theHindu Trimurti. The soul of all things Atoms and souls are synonymous terms. TheAll-Self The sum total of all selves. I am That Group consciousness. AUM Word ofRevelation. The Word God in the Flesh. The Gurudeva The Master of all. The lightof the world Shining in darkness.The MicrocosmThe second aspect Love wisdom. The son of the Father The revealer of the Monad.The Christ Christ in you, the hope of glory. The Soul Consciousness. The higherSelf The Lord of the bodies. The Ego The Self-realizing Identity. The Word Godin incarnation. AUM The Word of revelation. The Master The self on the throne.The radiant Augoeidas The light within. The spiritual Man Utilizing the lowerman.[52] 26. Ishvara (the Gurudeva), being unlimited by time condition, is theteacher of the primeval Lords.Since the conditions of time and space existed there have been those who haveachieved omniscience, those whose germ of knowledge has been subjected to properculture and thus developed, until it flowered forth into the full glory of theliberated soul. This condition became possible through certain factors:1. The identity of each individual soul with the Oversoul.2. The attractive force of that Oversoul as it drew the separated soul of allthings gradually back into Itself. This is the force of evolution itself, thegreat attractive agent which recalls the outgoing points of divine Life, theunits of consciousness, back to their source. It involves the response of theindividual soul to cosmic soul force.3. The intensive training given towards the climax by the occult Hierarchywhereby souls receive a stimulation and vitalisation which enables them to makemore rapid progress.The occult student must remember that this process has gone on in the wheels andcycles preceding our planet Earth. The primeval Lords, or Sages, are those greatAdepts Who—having “tasted experience” under the Law of Rebirth, were initiatedinto the mysteries by the one Initiator, the representative in our planet of the[53] Oversoul. They in their turn became teachers and initiators into themysteries.The one Master is found within; it is the soul, the inner ruler, the thinker onhis own plane. This one Master is a corporate part of the Whole, of theAll-Soul. Each expansion of consciousness which a man undergoes fits him to be aMaster to those who have not taken a similar expansion. Therefore—mastery beingachieved—there is nothing (speaking in terms of the human kingdom) to be foundexcept Masters who are likewise disciples. All are learners and all areteachers, differing only in degree of realisation. For instance:a. Aspirants to the Path are disciples of lesser disciples,b. Probationers on the Path are disciples of higher ones,c. Accepted disciples are the disciples of an adept and of a Master,d. An adept is the disciple of a Master,e. A Master is the disciple of a Mahatma,f. The Mahatmas are the disciples of still higher initiates,g. These in turn are the disciples of the Christ or of that official who is atthe head of the teaching department,h. The head of the teaching department is a disciple of the Lord of the World,i. The Lord of the World is the disciple of one of the three planetary spiritswho represent the three major aspects, [54]j. These are again disciples of the solar Logos.It will be apparent therefore to the careful student how interdependent all areand how the achievement of one will profoundly affect the entire body.Discipleship can be regarded as a generic term covering all those states orconditions of being in the fourth and fifth kingdoms (human and spiritual)wherein certain expansions of consciousness are brought about through specifictraining.27. The Word of Ishvara is AUM (or OM). This is the Pranava. (See Book I. Sutra1.)Students should remember that there are three basic Words or sounds inmanifestation. This is the case as far as the human kingdom is concerned. Theyare:I. The Word, or note of Nature. This is the Word or the sound of all formsexisting in physical plane substance, and as is usually known, it is sounded onthe fundamental note “FA.” It is a note with which the white occultist hasnothing to do, for his work is concerned not with the increase of tangibilitybut with the demonstration of the subjective or the intangible. This is the Wordof the third aspect, the Brahma or Holy Ghost aspect.II. The Sacred Word. This is the Word of Glory, the AUM. This is the Pranava,the sound of conscious Life itself as It is breathed forth into all forms. It isthe Word of the second aspect, and just as the Word of Nature when rightly [55]emanated provides the forms which are intended to reveal the soul or secondaspect, so the Pranava, when rightly expressed, demonstrates the Father orSpirit through the medium of the soul. It is the Word of the incarnated sons ofGod. In such a short commentary as this, it is not possible to write a treatiseon this secret of secrets, and this great mystery of the ages. All that can bedone is to collate certain facts about the AUM, and leave the student to extendthe concept and grasp the significance of the brief statements made according tothe state of his intuition.III. The Lost Word. The idea of this Lost Word has been preserved for us inMasonry. It is the Word of the first aspect, the spirit aspect, and only theinitiate of the third degree can truly begin the search for this word for onlythe freed soul can find it. This word concerns the highest initiations and it isprofitless for us further to consider it.The following statements about the Sacred Word can therefore be made and shouldbe studied with care:1. The AUM is the Word of glory, and is the Christ in us, the hope of glory.2. The Word when rightly apprehended causes the second, or Christ aspect ofdivinity to shine forth resplendently.3. It is the sound which brings into manifestation the incarnated soul(macrocosmic or microcosmic), the ego, the Christ, and causes the “radiantAugoeides” to be seen on earth. [56]4. It is the Word which is the releaser of consciousness and when correctlyunderstood and used, releases the soul from the limitations of form in the threeworlds.5. The AUM is the synthesiser of the three aspects and therefore is primarilythe Word of the human kingdom in which the three lines of divine lifemeet—spirit, soul and body.6. It is also the Word of the fifth, the Aryan race, in a special sense. Thework of that race is to reveal in a newer and fuller way the nature of the innerIdentity, of the soul within the form, the son of mind, the solar angel, thefifth principle.7. The significance of the Word only becomes apparent after the “light within”is realised. By its use the “spark” becomes a radiant light, the light becomes aflame, and the flame eventually becomes a sun. By its use the “sun ofrighteousness arises” in the life of every man.8. Each of the three letters has relation to the three aspects, and each can beapplied to any of the known triplicities.9. The Master, the God within, is indeed the Word, the AUM, and of this Master(found at the heart of all beings) it is true that “in the beginning was theWord, and the Word was with God (thus duality) and the Word was God.” Throughits use man arrives at a realisation of:a. His own essential divinity,b. The purpose of the form-taking process, [57]c. The constitution and nature of those forms,d. The reality of consciousness, or the relation of the divine self or spirit tothe form, its polar opposite.This relation, in its evolutionary working out, we call consciousness and theessential characteristic of this consciousness is love.10. The Guru or Master who leads a pupil up to the door of initiation and whowatches over him in all the initial and subsequent tests and processes likewiserepresents the Word, and through the scientific use of this great sound Heproduces a certain stimulation and vitalisation in the centres of the disciple,thus rendering certain developments possible.More about the Sacred Word is not advisable to add here. Enough has been givento indicate to the aspirant its purpose and potency. There will have to becommunicated in other ways and at other times further information as thestudent—through study and self initiated effort—arrives at just conclusions. Itmight be added, that this great Word, when meditated upon, gives the clue to thetrue esoteric meaning of the words in the Secret Doctrine by H. P. Blavatsky:“Life we look upon as the One Form of Existence, manifesting in what we callMatter; or what, incorrectly separating them, we name Spirit, Soul and Matter inman. Matter is the vehicle for the manifestation of Soul on this plane ofexistence, and Soul is the vehicle on a higher plane for the [58] manifestationof Spirit, and these three are a Trinity synthesized by Life, which pervadesthem all.”28. Through the sounding of the Word and through reflection upon its meaning,the Way is found.This is a very general paraphrase but conveys nevertheless the correctsignificance of the terms used in the Sanskrit. Only Vivekananda, among the manytranslators, gives this interpretation, putting it as follows:“The repetition of the OM and meditating upon its meaning (is the Way).”The other translators omit the final three words, though the inference is clear.The expression “the sounding of the Word” must not be too literally interpreted;the esoteric “sounding forth” is based upon a study of the Law of Vibration, andthe gradual tuning of the lower vibrations of the sheaths or vestures ofconsciousness so that they synchronise with the note or sound of the consciousindweller. Speaking correctly, the Word is to be sounded by the soul or the egoon its own plane, and the vibration will subsequently affect the various bodiesor vehicles which house that soul. The process is therefore a mental one and canonly really be done by those who—through meditation and discipline, coupled withservice—have made a conscious at-one-ment with the soul. Aspirants to thiscondition have to [59] utilise the potent factors of the imagination,visualisation and perseverance in meditation to reach this initial stage. Itshould be noted that this stage has to be reached, even if only in a relativelysmall degree, before the aspirant can become an accepted disciple.The process of sounding the Word is dual, as is emphasized here.There is, first of all, the act of the ego, solar angel, higher self or soul, ashe sounds out the Word from his own place, on the abstract levels of the mentalplane. He directs that sound, via the sutratma and the vestures of consciousnessto the physical brain of the man in incarnation, the shadow or reflection. This“sounding forth” has to be constantly repeated. The Sutratma is that magneticlink, spoken of in the Christian Bible as the “silver cord,” that thread ofliving light which connects the Monad, the Spirit in man, with the physicalbrain.Secondly, there is the earnest reflection of the man in his physical brain uponthat sound as he recognizes it. The two poles of being are hinted at here: thesoul and the man in incarnation, and between these two is found the thread,along which the Pranava (or word) vibrates. Students of the esoteric sciencehave to recognize the technique of the processes outlined. In the case of thesounding forth of the Word we have the following factors:1. The soul who sends, or breathes it forth,2. The sutratma or thread along which the sound vibrates, is carried ortransmitted, [60]3. The vestures of consciousness, mental, emotional and etheric which vibrate inresponse to the vibration or breath and are stimulated thereby,4. The brain which can be trained to recognize that sound and vibrate in unisonwith the breath,5. The subsequent act of the man in meditation. He hears the sound (calledsometimes the “still small Voice,” or the “Voice of the Silence”), he recognizesit for what it is and in deep reflection he assimilates the results of hissoul’s activity.Later when the aspirant has passed on into the mysteries and has learnt how tounify the soul and the lower man so that they function as a coordinated unit onearth, the man learns to sound the Word on the physical plane with the object ofawakening the forces which are latent within him and thereby arouse the centres.Thus he participates increasingly in the creative, magical and psychical work ofmanifestation, with the object ever in view of benefiting his fellow men andthus furthering the plans of the planetary hierarchy.29. From this comes the realization of the Self (the Soul) and the removal ofall obstacles.When the Master within is known, the assertion of his power becomes increasinglyfelt, and the aspirant submits his entire lower nature to the control of thatnew ruler.It should be noted here that the eventual complete [61] removal of all obstaclestranspires after the initial flash of realization. The sequence of happenings isas follows:1. Aspiration after knowledge of the soul,2. Realization of the obstacles, or an understanding of the things which preventtrue knowledge.3. Intellectual comprehension as to the nature of those obstacles,4. Determination to eliminate them,5. A sudden flash or vision of the soul Reality,6. Fresh aspiration and a strong determination to make that fleeting vision apermanent reality in the lower plane experience,7. The battle of Kurukshetra, with Krishna, the soul, heartening Arjuna, theaspirant, on to steady and continuous effort. The same thought is to be found inthe Old Testament, in the case of Joshua before the walls of Jericho.It might be well here to conclude this comment with Sutras 31, 32, 33 and 34, ofBook IV:31. When, through the removal of the hindrances and the purification of all thesheaths, the totality of knowledge becomes available, naught further remains forthe man to do.32. The modifications of the mind-stuff (or qualities of matter) through theinherent nature of the three gunas come to an end, for they have served theirpurpose.33. Time, which is the sequence of the modifications of the mind, likewiseterminates, giving place to the Eternal Now.34. The state of isolated Unity becomes possible when the three qualities ofmatter (the three gunas or potencies of Nature - A.A.B.) no longer exercise anyhold over the Self. The pure Spiritual Consciousness withdraws into the One.[62]THE OBSTACLES TO SOUL COGNITION AND THEIR REMOVAL30. The obstacles to soul cognition are bodily disability, mental inertia, wrongquestioning, carelessness, laziness, lack of dispassion, erroneous perception,inability to achieve concentration, failure to hold the meditative attitude whenachieved.Obstacle I. Bodily disability.It is interesting to note that the first obstacle has relation to the physicalbody. Aspirants would do well to remember this and should seek to adjust thephysical vehicle to the demands later to be made upon it. These adjustments willbe great and they fall into four groups:1. The rendering of the body immune to the attacks of disease or indisposition.This is in itself a triple process involving:a. The eradication of present disease,b. The refining and the purifying of the body so as to rebuild it eventually,c. The protection of the body from future attack and its utilization as avehicle of the soul.2. The strengthening and refining of the etheric body in order that it may befinally tuned up so that the work of force direction may be safely undertaken.The disciple has to pass the forces used in his work through his body.3. The unfoldment and awakening of the centres in the etheric body, thecentralization of the fires of the body and their just progression up the [63]spine, in order to make union with the fire of the soul.4. The coordination of the physical body in its two divisions and its subsequentalignment with the soul via the sutratma or the thread, which is the magneticlink.The third adjustment spoken of can only safely be undertaken after the firstthree means of yoga have been used and developed. These are:1. The five commandments, (See: Book II. Sutras 28 and 29.)2. The five rules, (See: Book II. Sutras 32 to 46.)3. Right poise. (See: Book II. Sutras 46 to 48.)This is a point often forgotten by aspirants to yoga, and hence the disastersand trouble so often seen amongst those who prematurely occupy themselves withthe awakening of the centres and the arousing of the serpent fire. Only when theentire relation of the aspirant to the social economy (as dealt with in thecommandments), only when the task of purifying and regulating the threefoldlower nature has been worked at (as outlined in the rules), and only as abalanced and controlled condition of the emotional nature has been brought aboutand right poise achieved, can the aspirant to Raja Yoga safely proceed to themore esoteric and occult work connected with the fires of his little system.This point cannot be too strongly emphasized. Only at a very advanced stage ofdiscipleship will it be safe for the man to deal consciously with the vitalfires and direct [64] their right progression up the spine. Few there are as yetwho have “kept the law and the commandments.”Obstacle II. Mental inertia.The next great basic obstacle (for these obstacles are given in the order oftheir relative power over average man) is inability to think clearly about theproblem of attainment. Unless clear thinking precedes action, insufficientmomentum will be found coupled with failure to appreciate the magnitude of theproblem. Mental inertia is due to the lethargic condition of the “vesture ofconsciousness” which we call the mental body and to the heavy rate of rhythmfound in most people. That is the reason why Raja Yoga necessarily makes agreater appeal to mental types than to pure devotees, and it accounts for thefact that those whose mental bodies are well equipped and actively used can morequickly be trained in this sacred science. For the majority of people, theawakening of the mental body, the development of an intellectual interest, andthe substitution of mind control in place of control by the emotions has toprecede any later realisation of the need of soul culture. The apparatus ofthought must be contacted and used before the nature of the thinker can beintelligently appreciated.When this is realised, the contribution to human development by the greatschools of thought we call Mental Science, Christian Science, New Thought andother groups which lay the emphasis upon the mental states will be more justlyappraised. [65] The human family is only now becoming aware of the “vesture ofconsciousness” which we call the mental body.The majority of men have as yet to build that vesture which occult students callthe mental body. From among those who are so doing, the true raja yogins will begathered.Obstacle Ill. Wrong questioning.This is the next stage and is also dependent upon a certain amount of mentaldevelopment. Some translators call this ‘doubt.’ This wrong questioning is thatwhich is based upon lower perception and the identification of the real man withthat illusory instrument, his mental body. This leads him to question theeternal verities, to doubt the existence of the fundamental realities and toseek for the solution of his problems in that which is ephemeral and transitory,and in the things of the senses.There is a questioning which is right and proper. It is that “asking ofquestions” spoken of by the Christ in the words “Ask and ye shall receive.” Thisfaculty of enquiry is deliberately cultivated in their disciples by all trueMasters in the Orient. They are taught to formulate questions about the innerrealities and then to find the answer for themselves through a search for thatsource of all knowledge, latent at the heart of all beings. To ask intelligentlyand to find the answer, they must first free themselves from all outer imposedauthority and from all tradition and from the imposition of every theological[66] dogma, whether religious or scientific. Only thus can the reality be foundand the truth be seen.“When thy Soul shall pass beyond the forest of delusion, thou shalt no moreregard what shall be taught, or what has been taught.When withdrawn from traditional teaching thy Soul shall stand steadfast, firm insoul-vision, then thou shalt gain union with the Soul.” Gita II.51.52.Obstacle IV. Carelessness.The attitude of mind dealt with here has been translated by some as“light-mindedness.” It is really that versatile mental attitude which makesone-pointedness and attention so difficult to achieve. It is literally thethought-form-making tendency of the mind stuff which has also been described asthe “mind’s tendency to flit from one object to another.” See Book III, Sutra11.Obstacle V. Laziness.All the commentators agree as to this translation, employing the terms, sloth,languor or laziness. This refers not so much to mental inertia (for it mayaccompany acute mental perception) as to that slothfulness of the entire lowerman which prevents him from measuring up to the intellectual recognition and theinner aspiration. The aspirant has been told what he has to do, the “means ofyoga” have been clear to him. He has glimpsed the ideal and is aware of theobstacles; he knows theoretically just what steps he has to take but there is nocorrespondence between his activity and his knowledge. There is a gap betweenhis aspiration and his performance. [67] Though he longs to achieve and to know,it is too hard work to fulfill the conditions. His will is not yet strong enoughto force him forwards. He permits time to slip by and does nothing.Obstacle VI. Lack of dispassion.This has been well translated by some as “addiction to objects.” This is thedesire for material and sensuous things. It is love of sense perceptions andattraction for all that brings a man back again and again into the condition ofphysical plane existence. The disciple has to cultivate “dispassion” or thatattitude which never identifies itself with forms of any kind, but which is everdetached and aloof, freed from limitations imposed by possessions andbelongings. This is covered in many places in the various sutras and need not beenlarged upon here.Obstacle VII. Erroneous perception.This inability to perceive correctly and to vision things as they really are, isthe natural outcome of the six previous obstacles. As long as the thinkeridentifies himself with form, as long as the lesser lives of the lower vesturesof consciousness can hold him in thrall, and as long as he refuses to separatehimself from the material aspect, just so long will his perceptions remainerroneous. Vision is of various kinds and these might be enumerated as follows:1. Physical vision reveals the nature of the physical plane, and is achievedthrough the medium of the eyes, photographing through the lens of the eye, theaspect of the tangible form, upon [68] the wonderful film which every manpossesses. It is circumscribed and limited.2. Etheric vision. This is a rapidly developing faculty of the human eye whichultimately will reveal the health aura of all forms in the four kingdoms ofnature, which will bring about recognition of the vital pranic emanations of allliving centres and will make manifest the conditions of the centres.3. Clairvoyance . This is the faculty of sight upon the astral plane and is oneof the lower “siddhis” or psychic powers. It is achieved through a surfacesensibility of the entire “body of feeling,” the emotional sheath, and issensuous perception carried to a very advanced condition. It is misleading and,apart from its higher correspondence, which is spiritual perception, is the veryapotheosis of maya or illusion.4. Symbolic vision. This is a faculty of the mental body and the factor whichproduces the seeing of colours, of geometrical symbols, fourth dimensionalsight, and those dreams and visions which are the result of mental activity, andnot of astral sight. Frequently these visions have a quality of prevision.These four types of vision are the cause of wrong perception and will onlyproduce illusion and error until that time when the higher forms of vision,enumerated below, supersede them. These higher forms of sight include theothers.5. Pure vision. This is spoken of by Patanjali in the words:“The seer is pure Knowledge (gnosis). Though [69] pure, he looks upon thepresented idea through the medium of the mind.” (Book II, Sutra 20.)The words “pure knowledge” have been translated “pure vision.” This vision isthe faculty of the soul which is pure knowledge, and is manifest when the souluses the mind as its instrument of vision. Charles Johnston translates the sameSutra as follows: “The seer is pure vision . . . . He looks out through thevesture of the mind.”It is that clear apprehension of knowledge and a perfect comprehension of thethings of the soul which is characteristic of the man who—through concentrationand meditation—has achieved mind control. The mind then becomes the window ofthe soul, and through it the spiritual man can look out onto a new and higherrealm of knowledge. Simultaneously with the development of this type of vision,the pineal gland becomes active, and the third eye (in etheric matter) developswith a paralleling activity.6. Spiritual vision or true perception. This type of vision opens up the worldof the intuitional or buddhic plane, and takes its possessor beyond the abstractlevels of the mental plane. The things of pure spirit, and the basic purposesunderlying all manifestation are thus realised, just as pure vision permittedits owner to tap the resources of pure wisdom. With the development of thisvision the alta major centre becomes active, and the thousand-petalled lotusunfolded.7. Cosmic sight. This is of a nature inconceivable to man and characterises therealisation of those Existences Who manifest through the [70] medium of aplanetary scheme in a solar system just as a man manifests through his bodies.By the study of these types of perception, the student will arrive at a justappreciation of the work he has to do. He is thus aided to place himself wherehe at present stands, and consequently to prepare intelligently for the nextstep forward.Obstacle VIII. Inability to achieve concentration.The two last obstacles indicate the way whereby “old things can pass away” andthe new man come into his heritage. The method of the disciple must not onlyinclude self-discipline or the subjugation of the vestures or sheaths, nor mustit only include service or identification with group consciousness, but it mustalso include the two stages of concentration, focussing or control of the mind,and meditation, the steady process of pondering upon what the soul has contactedand knows. These two will later be dealt with and will not be further touchedupon here.Obstacle IX. Failure to hold the meditative attitude.It will be apparent therefore that the first six obstacles deal with wrongconditions and the last three with the results of those conditions. They containa hint as to the method whereby liberation from the wrong states ofconsciousness can be effected.The next sutra is most interesting as it deals with the effects produced in eachof the four bodies [71] of the lower nature, in the case of the man who has notovercome the obstacles.31. Pain, despair, misplaced bodily activity and wrong direction (or control) ofthe life currents are the results of the obstacles in the lower psychic nature.Each of these four results expresses the condition of the lower man; they dealwith the effects of wrong centralisation or identification.1. Pain is the effect produced when the astral or emotional body is wronglypolarised. Pain is the outcome of failure to balance correctly the pairs ofopposites. It indicates lack of equilibrium.2. Despair is an effect of remorse, produced in the mental body and is itself acharacteristic of what may be called “the unregenerated mental” nature. Theaspirant has a perception of what might be, though the obstacles as yet overcomehim; he is ceaselessly conscious of failure, and this engenders in him acondition of remorse, of disgust, despair and of despondency.3. Misplaced bodily activity. The inner condition works out on the physicalplane as an intense activity, a violent seeking for solution or for solace, aconstant running hither and thither in search of peace. It is the maincharacteristic at this time of our mental Aryan race and is the cause of theaggressive intensity of endeavour found in all walks of life. To this theeducational processes (as they speed up the mental body) have been largelycontributory factors. The [72] great contribution of education (in schools,colleges, universities and other allied activities) has been to stimulate themental bodies of men. It is all part of the great plan, working ever towards theone objective—soul unfoldment.4. Wrong directions of the life currents. This is the effect produced in theetheric body by the inner turmoil. These life currents (for the student ofoccultism) are two in number:a. The life breath or prana,b. The life force or the fires of the body.It is the misuse of the life breath or wrong utilisation of prana that is thecause of eighty per cent of the present physical diseases. The other twenty percent is produced through ill directed life force through the centres, andattacks primarily the twenty per cent of humanity which can be called mentallypolarised. The clue for the student of occultism who aspires to liberation isnot to be found in breathing exercises, however, nor in any work with the sevencentres in the body. It will be found in an intense inner concentration uponrhythmic living and in the careful organisation of the life. As he does this,coordination of the subtler bodies with the physical body on the one hand, andwith the soul on the other, will eventuate in the automatic subsequentadjustment of pranic and vital energies.32. To overcome the obstacles and their accompaniments, the intense applicationof the will to some one truth (or principle) is required.It would be wise here, if the aspirant to yoga [73] would note that there areseven ways whereby peace may be achieved, and thus the goal be reached. Theseseven are next dealt with, and each has a distinct relation to the sevenobstacles earlier considered.Obstacle Remedy 1. Bodily disability Wholesome, sane living. (1.33.) 2. Mentalinertia Control of the life force. (1.34.) 3. Wrong questioning One pointedthought. (1.35.) 4. Carelessness Meditation. (1.36.) 5. Laziness Selfdiscipline. (1.37.) 6. Lack of dispassion Correct analysis. (1.38.) 7. Erroneousperception Illumination. (1.39.)These corrections of wrong conditions are of profound importance in the earlystages of yoga and hence their emphasis in Book I.But a theoretical understanding of the obstacles and their cure is of smallavail as long as the intense application of the will is omitted. Only theconstant, steady, enduring effort of the will, functioning through the mind,will suffice to bring the aspirant out of darkness into light and to lead himfrom the condition of death into immortality.Once the principle is understood, then the disciple can work intelligently andhence the necessity of a right understanding of the principles or qualitieswhere the truth regarding reality or God can be known.All forms exist in order to express truth. By the steady application of God’swill in the Whole is truth revealed through the medium of matter. When the truthor basic principle is known spirit will then stand revealed. When the disciplerealises [74] what principle his various forms, sheaths, or bodies are intendedto express, then he will know how to direct his will with exactitude so as tobring about the desired conditions. The sheaths and vehicles are simply hisbodies of manifestation on the various planes of the system, and those sheathsmust express the principle which is the characteristic or quality underlyingeach plane. For instance, the seven principles with which man is concerned are:1. Prana vital energy etheric body physical plane. 2. Kama desire, feelingastral body astral plane. 3. Lower Manas concrete mind mental body mental plane.4. Higher Manas abstract mind egoic body mental plane. 5. Buddhi Intuitionbuddhic body buddhic plane. 6. Atma spiritual will atmic body atmic plane.And that which corresponds to the “boundless immutable principle” in themacrocosm, the Monad (on its own plane) constitutes the seventh principle. Thereare other ways of enumerating the principles, for Subba Rao is correct in onerespect when he says there are only five principles. The two highest, atma andthe life monadic, are not principles at all.Through the conscious utilisation of the will on each plane, the vehicle isdirected constantly into an increasingly accurate expression of the one truth.This is the true significance of the sutra under consideration and the clue towhy the adepts are as yet still studying this treatise on yoga. Theirunderstanding of truth in its entirety [75] is not yet complete on all planesand the basic rules hold good throughout, though they are variously applied.Principles are applicable to all differentiations and to all states of being.As a man studies the spheres in which his consciousness is functioning, as hecomes to an understanding of the vehicles he must use in any particular sphere,as he awakens to a knowledge of the specific divine quality which the body isintended to express as a part or aspect of the one truth or reality, he becomesaware of the inadequacies present, of the obstacles which hinder and of thedifficulties which must be surmounted. Then comes the application of the willand its concentration upon the principle, or upon the quality seekingexpression. Thus the lower manifestation is brought into line with the higherfor “as a man thinketh so is he.”33. The peace of the chitta (or mind stuff) can be brought about through thepractice of sympathy, tenderness, steadiness of purpose, and dispassion inregard to pleasure or pain, or towards all forms of good or evil.In this sutra we are dealing with the physical body, which undergoes experienceson the physical plane and which utilises the brain consciousness. The tendencyof that body is towards all other objective forms, and it is apt (in itsunregenerate state) to gravitate with facility towards material objects. Thenature of those objects will be dependent upon the point in evolution of theexperiencing ego. This must be carefully remembered [76] when studying thissutra, otherwise there will be a misapprehension of the final clause.Discriminative action must ever be taken with reference to all demonstrations ofgood and evil force, and the law works in this connection, but emancipation fromall the physical forms which that energy may take, eventuates when dispassiontowards these objective forms is practiced. It might be useful if we note thatthe sympathy dealt with concerns our relation to all other pilgrims, or towardsthe fourth kingdom in nature; tenderness covers our relation to the animal orthird kingdom; steadiness of purpose deals with our relation to the Hierarchy ofthe planet, and dispassion concerns our attitude to all the reactions of thelower personal self. The comprehensiveness of this sutra is therefore apparentand concerns all the brain vibrations of the disciple.The physical body is consequently looked upon as a vehicle for the expressionof:a. Helpfulness to our fellow men,b. Tender handling of the animal kingdom,c. Service on the physical plane in cooperation with the Hierarchy,d. Discipline of the physical appetites and dispassion in regard to all formswhich appeal to the appetites and to the senses, whether called harmful or not.All alike must be transcended.Thus peace is achieved, peace of the chitta or mind stuff, peace of the brainreactions and eventually complete quiet and calm. The idea is well covered byCharles Johnston in the words of his translation of this sutra, “The psychicnature [77] moves to gracious peace,” and the man expresses wholesomeness, arounded out nature, and complete sanity of thought and act. All bodilydisability is in this way overcome, and wholeness expresses the nature of themanifestation.34. The peace of the chitta is also brought about by the regulation of the pranaor life breath.Students will do well to note that Patanjali includes Pranayama (or the scienceof the breath or of pranic energy) among other methods for arriving at the“peace of the chitta.” He does not however lay any special emphasis upon it. Ashas been earlier pointed out, pranayama is a term which can be used to coverthree processes, all interrelated and allied.1. The science of rhythmic living, or the regulation of the acts of daily lifethrough the organisation of time and the wise utilisation of space. Through thisthe man becomes adept, a creator on the physical plane and a cooperator in theplans of the hierarchy as they demonstrate in cyclic evolution.2. The science of the breath, or the vitalisation of the lower man throughinhalation and exhalation. Man knows himself occultly to be a “living soul,” andutilizes the factor of the breath. Through this he becomes aware of the unity oflife and the relationship existing between all forms wherein the life of God isfound. He becomes a brother as well as an adept and knows [78] that brotherhoodis a fact in nature and not a sublime theory.3. The science of the centres, or laya yoga; this is the application of the lawto the forces of nature and the scientific utilisation of those forces by theman. It involves the passing of certain septenates of energy through the centresup the spine and into the head by a certain specified geometrical progression.This makes a man a master psychic, and unfolds in him certain latent powerswhich—when unfolded—put him in touch with the soul of all things and with thesubjective side of nature.It is significant to note that this mode of arriving at peace follows upon themethod of sane wholesome living and its consequent result—a sound physical body.Later on, when Patanjali again refers to the regulation of the breath and of theenergy currents, he places it as the fourth means of yoga and states that onlywhen right poise has been achieved (the third Means) as a result of keeping theCommandments and the Rules (Means one and two) is this regulation to beattempted. Students would do well to study these means and note how interest inthe centres is only permissible after a man has so balanced his life andpurified his nature that danger is no longer possible.35. The mind can be trained to steadiness through those forms of concentrationwhich have relation to the sense perceptions.We are dealing with those forms of unfoldment [79] and of control whicheventuate in what has been called “gracious peace.” We have seen that correctgroup relations and rhythmic living will produce that condition whereinstillness of the vehicles or of the sheaths is attained, and the lower man canthen adequately reflect the higher or spiritual man. Now we touch upon certainaspects of the Raja Yoga philosophy and the key to the understanding of thissutra is found in the word detachment . The aspirant (as he makes his sensecontacts and through the medium of the five senses comes into touch with thephenomenal world) will gradually assume more and more the position of onlooker.His consciousness therefore shifts slowly out of the realm of the sense vehiclesinto that of the “dweller in the body.”It is interesting to note here, the Hindu teaching upon the uses of the tongueand the entire region of the nose and the palate. The orthodox oriental teachinggives the following suggestions:Method Sense Result 1. Concentration upon the tip of the nose smell perfumes. 2.Concentration upon the root of the tongue hearing sounds. 3. Concentration uponthe tip of the tongue taste flames. 4. Concentration upon the middle of thetongue touch vibration. 5. Concentration upon the palate sight pictures,visions.The aspirant must not literalise these things nor seek blindly to meditate, forinstance, upon [80] the tip of the tongue. The lesson to be learnt, under thelaw of analogy, is that the tongue typifies the creative faculty, the thirdaspect in its five fold nature. The relation of the five senses (as synthesisedhere in the region of the mouth) to the five rays forming the synthesis governedby the Mahachohan (director of the third ray aspect upon our planet), will befound illuminating. Students would find it valuable to work out the analogybetween these five rays and the five senses and the mouth as the organ ofspeech. As the study is carried forward it will be seen that two other physicalorgans, the pituitary body and the pineal gland, correspond to the remaining twoaspects, love wisdom and organising power, will or purpose. These seven pointsin the head (and all are found within a comparatively small area) are thesymbols in physical matter of the three great aspects manifesting as the seven.As the aspirant therefore assumes the position of the ruler of the senses and asthe analyser of all his sense perceptions, he gradually becomes more mentallyconcentrated, and the advanced yogi can identify himself at any moment with anyone of the ray energies to the exclusion—where desired—of the others.The student is warned not to imagine that this “gracious peace” can be achievedthrough definite meditation upon any specific sense. Through an understanding ofthe laws of creation and of sound, through a consideration of the sounding boardof the mouth and the method whereby speech becomes possible, a knowledge of theworld [81] creative processes can be arrived at, and the man can achieve anunderstanding of the laws whereby all forms come into being. The senses of allyogis are naturally abnormally acute and this fact should be remembered.36. By meditation upon Light and upon Radiance, knowledge of the Spirit can bereached and thus peace can be achieved.The student should here note that each of the methods outlined above concernscertain centres. There are seven methods of attainment mentioned and thereforewe can infer that the seven centres are involved.Method I. Sutra 33. Solar plexus centre.The peace of the chitta (or mind stuff) can be brought about through thepractice of sympathy, tenderness, steadiness of purpose, and dispassion inregard to pleasure or pain, or towards all forms of good or evil.Method II. Sutra 34. Centre at the base of the spine.The peace of the chitta is also brought about by the regulation of the prana.Method III. Sutra 35. Centre between the eyebrows.The mind can be trained to steadiness through those forms of concentration whichhave relation to the sense perceptions.Method IV. Sutra 36. Head centre.By meditation upon Light and upon Radiance, knowledge of the Spirit can bereached and thus peace can be achieved. [82]Method V. Sutra 37. Sacral centre.The chitta is stabilized and rendered free from illusion as the lower nature ispurified and no longer indulged.Method VI. Sutra 38. Throat centre.Peace (steadiness of the chitta) can be reached through meditation on theknowledge which dreams give.Method VII. Sutra 39. Heart centre.Peace can also be reached through concentration upon that which is dearest tothe heart.These should be carefully considered, even if no details of procedure can herebe given. Only the principle and the law involved can be considered by thestudent. It should be remembered also that all these centres have theircorrespondences in the etheric matter found in the region of the head and thatit is when these seven head centres are awakened that their counterparts arealso safely awakened. These seven head centres correspond in the microcosm tothe seven Rishis of the Great Bear, the prototypes of the seven Heavenly Men,and the centres above enumerated relate to the energy of the seven Heavenly MenThemselves.It is not necessary to enlarge here upon these centres beyond indicating thefollowing:1. The aspirant may regard each centre symbolically as a lotus.2. This lotus is formed of energy units moving or vibrating in a specific mannerand these vibration-waves assume the forms we call the petals of the lotus. [83]3. Each lotus consists of:a. A certain number of petals,b. A pericarp or supporting calyx,c. A centre of pure white light called the “jewel.”4. Each centre corresponds to a sacred planet, the body of manifestation of oneof the seven Heavenly Men.5. Every centre has to be developed through the use of the Word. This word isAUM and it must appear in the vibrant centre eventually. When it shines forthperfectly within the wheel then that centre has perfectly awakened.6. Certain of the qualities of the sun are the qualities of the centres.a. Quality of the solar plexus warmth. b. Quality of centre at base of spinekundalini fire. c. Quality of the ajna centre between the eyebrows illuminatinglight. d. Quality of the head centre cold light. e. Quality of the sacral centremoisture. f. Quality of the throat centre red light. g. Quality of the heartcentre radiant or magnetic light.In this sutra meditation upon light and radiance is enjoined and we learn thatthrough this light and the ability to use it, knowledge of the spirit can bearrived at. At the centre of the “heart chakra” dwells Brahma, says the oldScripture and He reveals Himself in the light. The aspirant has therefore tobecome aware of the “point of light within the wheel with twelve [84] spokes”and as that point of light is dwelt upon, it reveals a road which must betravelled should the aspirant seek to arrive at his goal. The first thing whichis revealed is darkness. This should be remembered. In terms of occidentalmysticism this brings about the “dark night of the soul.” We will not, however,dwell upon the mystical aspect as it is necessary for us to keep our conclusionsas much as possible along the occult line. The truth, as expressed in terms ofChristian mysticism, has been frequently and adequately covered.37. The chitta is stabilised and rendered free from illusion as the lower natureis purified and no longer indulged.This translation is a particularly free one, as the words used in the Sanskritare somewhat difficult of exact interpretation. The thought conveyed is that asthe organs of perception and as the sense contacts are continually negated bythe real man (who no longer seeks to identify himself with them), then hebecomes “free from passion.” Heat, or desire for all objects, is overcome. Hestands then free from his lower sense nature. This results in a correspondingmental stability and in an ability to concentrate, for the mind stuff is nolonger subject to the modifications produced by sense reactions of any kind,either those we call good or those we call bad.This has been strongly advocated in many of the systems and one of the methodssuggested [85] is constant meditation upon such great identities as Krishna, theBuddha and the Christ, who have freed Themselves from all sense reactions. Thisthought is brought out in some of the translations, but though indicated fromone point of view, does not seem to be the main idea intended. Freedom fromattachment is brought about as the fires of desire are overcome, and though thesacral centre is depicted as having specific relation to the sex nature, yetthat sex nature (as it expresses itself on the physical plane) is symbolic ofany attachment between the soul and any object of desire other than the spirit.38. Peace (steadiness of the chitta) can be reached through meditation on theknowledge which dreams give.The significant words in Sutra 38 are the phrase “the knowledge which dreamsgive” and in this connection the commentary on Sutra 10 is of interest. Theoriental occultist uses the word “dream” in a much more technical sense thandoes the westerner and this must be fully grasped by the aspirant. To theoriental, the deepest dream condition is that in which the real man is sunk whenin physical incarnation. This corresponds to that dream state which we recognizeas caused by the vibration of the cells of the physical brain. Chaos, lack ofcontinuity and ill regulated eventualities are present, coupled with aninability to recollect truly and accurately when awake. This condition isphysical plane dreaming. [86] Then there is the dream condition in which the manparticipates when immersed in sensuous perception of one kind or another, eitherof pleasure or of pain. This is experienced in the astral or emotional body. Theknowledge given by the physical plane condition is largely instinctual; thatachieved through the astral dream condition is largely sensuous. One is racialand group realisation, the other is relative to the not-self and to man’srelation to the not-self.There comes in again a higher state of dream consciousness in which a faculty ofanother kind comes into play, and this might be called the imagination, bringingits own form of knowledge. Imagination involves certain mental states such as:a. Memory of things as they have been known, as states of consciousness,b. Anticipation of things as they may be known or of states of consciousness,c. Visualisation of the imaginary conditions and then the utilisation of theinvoked image as a form, through which a new realm of realisation may becontacted, once the dreamer can identify himself with that which he hasimagined.In these three dream states we have the condition of the thinker in the threeplanes in the three worlds, from the state of ignorant savagery to that of theaverage enlightened man. It leads on then to a much higher state of dreamconsciousness.The true use of the imagination necessitates a high degree of control and ofmental power and [87] where this is present leads eventually to what is calledthe “state of samadhi.” This is that condition wherein the adept can put theentire lower man to sleep, and himself pass into that realm wherein the “dreamsof God” Himself are known, and in which knowledge of the “images” which theDeity has created can be contacted and seen. Thus the adept can intelligentlyparticipate in the great plan of evolution.Beyond this state of samadhi lies the dream state of the Nirmanakayas and of theBuddhas, and so on up the scale of hierarchical life till that great Dreamer isknown, who is the One, the only Narayana, the Lord of the World Himself, theAncient of Days, our Planetary Logos. The student can only arrive at a very dimunderstanding of the nature of these dream states as he studies the ideaconveyed in the earlier statement to the effect that, to the occultist, life onthe physical plane is but a dream condition.39. Peace can also be reached through concentration upon that which is dearestto the heart.Sutra 39 in its very simplicity carries with it, its own powerful appeal. In itcan be traced the various stages of acquirement—desire, longing, concentrateddetermination to possess, the negation of all that does not meet thatrequirement, the emptying of the hands so as to be free for new possession, thenpossession itself, satisfaction, peace. But with all things pertaining to [88]the lower desires, the peace is but temporary, a new desire awakes and thatwhich has been held so joyously is relinquished. Only that which is the fruitionof the ages, only that which is the regaining of an old possession fullysatisfies. Let the student therefore study and ascertain whether that which isdearest to his heart is temporal, transitory and ephemeral, or whether it is, asthe great Lord has said, “treasure laid up in heaven.”We now come to the most comprehensive sutra in the book: (40). It might bepointed out here that these “seven ways to psychic peace,” as they have beencalled, cover the seven methods of the seven rays in connection with the controlof the psychic nature. It is important to emphasise this. These seven ways havea direct relation to the four initiations of the threshold, for there is nomajor initiation for any son of God who has not achieved a measure of psychicpeace. Students will find it of interest to work out these seven ways to peacein relation to one or other of the seven rays, assigning the way to the raywherever it seems to them appropriate.A SUMMATION OF THE RAJA YOGA SYSTEM40. Thus his realisation extends from the infinitely small to the infinitelygreat, and from annu (the atom or speck) to atma (or spirit) his knowledge isperfected.This translation does not adhere to the exact Sanskrit terms. It conveysnevertheless the exact meaning of the original which is the one thing [89] ofvital importance. An old verse from one of the hidden scriptures runs as followsand serves to elucidate the idea of this sutra:“Within the speck God can be seen. Within the man God can reign. Within Brahmaboth are found; yet all is one. The atom is as God, God as the atom.”It is an occult truism that; as a man arrives at a knowledge of himself, underthe great law of analogy he arrives at the knowledge of God. This knowledgecovers five great aspects:1. Forms,2. The constituents of form,3. Forces,4. Groups,5. Energy.Man must understand the nature of his body and of all his sheaths. This concernshis knowledge of form. He discovers that forms are made of atoms or “points ofenergy” and that all forms are alike in this respect. This knowledge concernsthe constituents of form. He arrives next at an understanding of the aggregateof the energy of the atoms which constitute his forms, or, in other words, at aknowledge of the varying forces; the nature of these forces is determined by therhythm, the activity and the quality of the atoms which form the sheath orsheaths. This knowledge concerns forces. Later he discovers analogous forms withanalogous vibration and force demonstration, and this knowledge concerns groups.Consequently he finds his place and knows his work. Finally he arrives at aknowledge [90] of that which concerns all forms, controls all forces and is themotive power of all groups. This knowledge concerns energy; it has to do withthe nature of spirit. Through the medium of these five realisations man arrivesat mastery, for realisation entails certain factors which might be enumerated asfollows:1. Aspiration,2. Study and investigation,3. Experiment,4. Discovery,5. Identification,6. Realisation.The adept can identify himself with or enter into the consciousness of theinfinitesimally small. He can identify himself with the atom of substance and heknows what is as yet unknown to modern scientists. He realizes also that as thehuman kingdom (composed of human atoms) is the midway point or station on theladder of evolution, therefore the infinitely small is as far away from himrelatively as the infinitely great. It is as far a road to travel to embrace theconsciousness of the minutest of all God’s manifestations as it is to embracethe greatest, a solar system. Nevertheless, in all these ranges ofconsciousness, the method of mastery is the same—perfectly concentratedmeditation, leading to perfected power over the mind. The mind is so constitutedthat it serves the purpose of both a telescope, bringing the seer into touchwith the macrocosm, and a microscope bringing him into touch also with theminutest atom. [91]41. To him whose vrittis (modifications of the substance of the mind) areentirely controlled there eventuates a state of identity with, and similarityto, that which is realised. The knower, knowledge and the field of knowledgebecome one, just as the crystal takes to itself the colours of that which isreflected in it.This sutra grows naturally out of the previous one. The perfected seer in hisconsciousness embraces the entire field of knowledge, from the standpoint ofonlooker or perceiver and from the standpoint of identification. He is one withthe atom of substance, he is able to cognize the minutest universe; he is onewith the solar system, the vastest universe he is permitted to cognize in thisgreater cycle. His soul and their soul are seen to be identical—potentiality isseen in one, and (from the human standpoint) incomprehensible order leading toultimate perfection is seen in the other. The activity which holds the electronsgathered around their centre is recognized as identical in nature with thatwhich holds the planets in their orbits around the sun, and between these twodivine manifestations the whole range of form is found.The occult student has to realise that forms are diverse and many, but that allsouls are identical with the Oversoul. The complete knowledge of the nature,quality, key and note of one soul (whether of a chemical atom, a rose, a pearl,a man or an angel) would reveal all souls upon the ladder of evolution. And theprocess is the same [92] for all: Recognition , the use of the sense organs,including the sixth sense, the mind, in appreciation of the form and itsconstituents; Concentration , an act of the will whereby the form is negated bythe senses and the knower passes behind it to that which vibrates in tune withhis own soul. Thus knowledge is arrived at,—knowledge of that which the form (orfield of knowledge) is seeking to express,—its soul, key or quality.Then follows Contemplation , the identification of the knower with that withinhimself which is identical with the soul within the form. The two are then oneand complete realisation is the case. This can be cultivated in a most practicalway between human beings. There must be recognition of the contact that comesbetween two men who can see, hear and touch each other. A superficialform-recognition is the result. But another stage is possible wherein a man canpass behind the form and arrive at that which is the quality of his brother; hecan touch that aspect of the consciousness which is analogous to his own. Hebecomes aware of the quality of his brother’s life, of the nature of his plans,aspirations, hopes and purposes. He knows his brother, and the better he knowshimself and his own soul, the deeper will be his knowledge of his brother.Finally, he can identify himself with his brother and become as he is, knowingand feeling as his brother’s soul knows and feels. This is the meaning behindthe occult words of St. John’s Epistle “We shall be like Him for we shall seeHim as He is.”[93] It may be of value here if certain synonyms are again enumerated, whichwill, if borne in mind, clarify much of the teaching of the sutras, and enablethe student to apply these thoughts in practical fashion to his own life.Spirit Soul Body. Monad Ego Personality. Divine Self Higher Self Lower Self.Perceiver Perception That which is perceived. Knower Knowledge The field ofknowledge. Thinker Thought The mind (this is the crystal, reflecting the thoughtof the thinker).It aids also to remember:1. That on the physical plane the perceiver uses the five senses in order toarrive at the field of knowledge.2. That all our three planes in the three worlds constitute the dense physicalbody of that One in Whom “we live and move and have our being.”3. That on the astral or emotional plane, the lower powers of clairvoyance andclairaudience are used by the perceiver and when misused reveal the serpent inthe garden.4. That on the mental plane psychometry and symbology (including numerology andgeometry) are used by the perceiver to arrive at an understanding of the lowermental levels.5. That only when these three are seen as lower and as constituting the formaspect does the perceiver arrive at a condition where he can begin to understandthe nature of the soul and [94] comprehend the true significance of Sutras 40and 41.6. That, having reached that point, he begins to discriminate and to use themind as the sixth sense, arriving thereby at that subjective quality or lifewhich lies back of the field of knowledge (or form). This constitutes the natureof the soul within the form, and is, potentially and in fact, omniscient andomnipresent.7. Having reached the soul in any form and contacted it through the medium ofhis own soul, he finds that all souls are one and can put himself with ease inthe soul of an atom or of a humming bird, or he can expand his realisation inanother direction and know himself one with God and with all superhumanexistences.42. When the perceiver blends the words, the idea (or meaning) and the object,this is called the mental condition of judicial reasoning.In this sutra and the following one, Patanjali is enlarging upon an earlierformulation of the truth. (See Sutra 7.) He teaches that meditation is of twokinds:1. With an object or seed, and therefore employing the rationalising judicialmind, the mental body with its concretising faculty, and its ability to createthought forms,2. Without an object or seedless, and therefore employing a different faculty,and one which is only possible when the concrete mind is understood, andutilised with correctness. This correct [95] use involves the ability to “stillthe modifications of the mind,” reduce the “chitta” or mind stuff to quietude sothat it can take on the colouring of the higher knowledge and reflect the higherrealities.The perceiver has to arrive at a knowledge of subliminal things by the process,first of all, of awareness of the external form, then a passing beyond theexternal form to the internal state of that form, to that which producesexternality (being force of some kind), until he arrives at that which is thecause of both. These three are called in this sutra:The idea The cause back of the objective form. The word The sound which producesform. The object The form produced by the sound to express the idea.Students should realise that this covers the earlier meditative state and,because the lower mind is utilised in the process, is the separative method.Things become separated into their component parts and are found to be—as allelse in nature—triple. Once this is grasped the occult significance andimportance of all meditation becomes apparent and the method whereby occultistsare made becomes clear. Always in the process of arriving at an understanding ofnature, the occultist works inwards from the external form in order to discoverthe sound which created it, or the aggregate of forces which produced theexternal shape; every aggregate of forces has [96] its own sound, produced bytheir interplay. Having discovered that, he penetrates still further inwardstill he touches the cause, idea or divine thought (emanating from the Logos,planetary or solar), which gave rise to the sound, thus producing the form.In creative work, the adept starts on the inside and—knowing the idea which heseeks to embody in form—he utters certain words or sounds and thus calls incertain forces which produce (through their interplay) a form of some kind. Thehigher the level on which the adept works the more elevated the ideas touchedand the simpler or more synthetic the sounds uttered.Students of Raja Yoga have, however, to grasp the elementary facts concerningall forms and to familiarize themselves in their meditation with the work ofseparating the triplicities, so as to be able eventually to contact any of thecomponent aspects as they will. In this way the nature of consciousness isunderstood, for the perceiver (who is trained in these differentiations) canenter into the consciousness of the atoms composing any tangible form, and canadvance further and enter into the consciousness of the energies who produce theobjective body. These are literally what has been called the “Army of theVoice.” He can also contact eventually the consciousness of that Great Life whois responsible for the initial word. These are the great landmarks, but inbetween are many grades of lives responsible for the intermediate sounds andthese can therefore be contacted and known. [97]43. Perception without judicial reasoning is arrived at when the memory nolonger holds control, the word and the object are transcended and only the ideais present.This condition is the state of “meditation without seed,” free from the rationaluse of the mind, and its faculty to concretise. The object (which is broughtinto the mind consciousness through recollection or memory) is no longerconsidered, and the word which designates it and expresses its power is nolonger heard. Only the idea of which the other two are expressions is realized,and the perceiver enters into the realm of ideas and of causes. This is purecontemplation, free from forms and thought. In it the perceiver looks out uponthe world of causes; he sees with clear vision the divine impulses; then havingthus contemplated the inner workings of the kingdom of God, he reflects backinto the quiescent mental body or mind that which he has seen, and that mentalbody throws down the knowledge gained into the physical brain.44. The same two processes of concentration, with and without judicial action ofthe mind can be applied also to things subtle.This sutra is clear without much explanation. The word “subtle” has a widemeaning, but (from the standpoint of Patanjali) is most frequently applied tothe essential something which we become aware of after we have employed the five[98] senses; i.e. , the rose is the objective tangible form; its scent is the“thing subtle” back of the form. This expresses its quality to the occultist andis the result of the subtler elements producing its manifestation. The grosserelements produce the form; but within that gross form is a subtler one which wecan only contact through acute perception or clarified sense. In the commentaryfound in Woods’ translation the following words may serve to elucidate, and, ifmeditated upon by the more advanced students, will be found to be of profoundoccult significance:“... the atom of earth is produced by the five fire elements, among which thefire element of odour predominates. Likewise the atom of water is produced fromthe four fire elements among which the fire element of taste predominates.Likewise the atom of fire is produced from the three fire elements, excludingthe fire element of odour and of taste, and among which the fire element ofcolour predominates. Likewise the atom of wind is produced from the two fireelements beginning with odour and of which two the fire element of touchpredominates. Likewise the atom of air from the fire element sound alone.”If this idea is extended to the macrocosm, we will find that we can meditateupon the external form of God in Nature both with and without judicial action ofthe mind. Then, experience in meditation having been gained, and by an act ofthe will, the student can meditate on the subtle subjective nature of God asmanifested under the great Law of Attraction, to which the Christian [99] referswhen he says “God is Love.” The nature of God, the great “love” or attractiveforce, is responsible for the “things subtle” which are veiled by the thingsexternal.45. The gross leads into the subtle and the subtle leads in progressive stagesto that state of pure spiritual being called Pradhana.Let the student remember here the following degrees or stages through which hemust pass as he penetrates into the heart of the innermost:These can be applied to all the planes of the three worlds with which man isconcerned, and have a close relation to the pairs of opposites which he has tobalance on the emotional plane. Behind all these is found that balanced state,called Pradhana, which is the cause of what is contacted physically and sensedsubtly. This balanced state can well be called unresolvable primary substance,matter united with spirit, undifferentiated yet without form or distinguishingmark. Behind these three again is found the Absolute Principle but these threeare all that man can know whilst in manifestation. Vivekananda in his commentarysays as follows:1. The gross form, bhutas, rational tangible sheaths. 2. The subtle the natureor qualities, the tanmatras, the indryas, or the senses, the sense organs andthat which is sensed.“The grosser objects are only the elements and everything manufactured out ofthem. The five [100] objects begin with Tanmatras or five particles. The organs,the mind (the aggregate of all senses) egoism, the mind stuff (the cause of allmanifestation) the equilibrium state of sattva, rajas and tamas (the threequalities of matter. A. B.),—called Pradhana (Chief) Prakriti (nature) orAvyakta (unmanifest) are all included in the category of five objects. ThePurusa (the soul) alone is excepted from this definition.).”Vivekananda apparently here translates purusa as soul, but it is usuallytranslated spirit and refers to the first aspect.46. All this constitutes meditation with seed.The last four sutras have dealt with those forms of concentration which havebeen built up around an object. That object may concern that which is subtle andintangible from the physical plane standpoint, nevertheless (from the standpointof the real or spiritual man) the fact of the not-self is involved. He isconcerned with that which (in any of its aspects) may lead him into realms whichare not primarily those of pure spirit. We need, however, to remember here thatall these four stages are necessary and must precede any more spiritualrealization. The mind of man is not in itself so constituted that it canapprehend the things of spirit. As he passes from one stage of “seeded”meditation to another, he ever approaches nearer to the seat of all knowledge,and will eventually contact that upon which [101] he is meditating. Then thenature of the thinker himself, as pure spirit, will be apprehended, and thesteps, stages, objects, seeds, organs, forms (subtle or gross) will all be lostsight of and only spirit be known. Both feeling and mind will then betranscended and only God Himself be seen; the lower vibrations will no longer besensed; colour will no longer be seen; only light will be known; vision will belost sight of, and the sound or word will alone be heard. The “eye of Shiva”will be left and with that the seer will identify himself.In the above fourfold elimination, the stages of realization are hinted at—thosestages which lead a man out of the world of form into the realm of the formless.Students will find it interesting to compare the four stages whereby “seededmeditation” progresses, with the four above. It might be pointed out also thatin any meditation wherein consciousness is recognized, then an object ispresent; in any meditation wherein the perceiver is aware of that which is to beseen, then there is as yet a condition of form perception. Only when all formsand the field of knowledge itself are lost sight of, and the knower recognizeshimself for what he essentially is (being lost in contemplation of his own purespiritual nature), can ideal, formless, seedless, objectless meditation bearrived at. It is here that the language of the occultist and mystic both fail,for language deals with objectivity and its relation to spirit. Therefore thishigher condition of meditation is likened to a sleep or trance condition, [102]but is the antithesis of physical sleep or the trance of the medium, for in itthe spiritual man is fully awake on those planes which transcend definition. Heis aware, in a full sense, of his direct Spiritual Identity.47. When this super-contemplative state is reached, the Yogi acquires purespiritual realisation through the balanced quiet of the Chitta (or mind stuff).The Sanskrit words employed in this sutra can only be adequately translated intoclear terms by the use of certain phrases which make the English versionclearer. Literally, the sutra might be stated to run as follows “Clearperspicuity follows through the quiet chitta.” It should be remembered here thatthe idea involved is that of purity in its true sense, meaning “freedom fromlimitation,” and therefore signifying the attainment of pure spiritualrealization. Contact by the soul with the monad or spirit is the result, andknowledge of this contact is transmitted to the physical brain.This is only possible at a very advanced stage of yoga practice, and when themind stuff is utterly still. The Father in Heaven is known, as revealed by theSon to the Mother. Sattva (or rhythm) alone becomes manifest, rajas (activity)and tamas (inertia) being dominated and controlled. We should remember here thatsattva has reference to the rhythm of the forms in which the yogi isfunctioning, and only as they express [103] the highest of the three gunas (orqualities of matter) is the highest or spiritual aspect known. Only as rajascontrols is the second aspect known; only as tamas holds sway is the lowestaspect known. There is an interesting analogy between the inertia (or tamas)aspect of matter and the condition of the bodies of the yogi when in the highestsamadhi. Then the sattvic or rhythmic motion is so complete that to the eye ofthe average man a condition of quiescence is achieved which is the sublimationof the tamasic or inert condition of the densest substance.The following words from the commentary dealt with in Woods’ translation of thesutras will be found helpful:“When freed from obscuration by impurity, the sattva of the thinking-substance,the essence of which is light, has pellucid steady flow not overwhelmed by therajas and the tamas. This is the clearness. When this clearness arises in thesuper reflective balanced-state then the yogin gains the internal undisturbedcalm (that is to say), the vision of the flash (sputa) of insight which does notpass successively through the serial order (of the usual processes ofexperience) and which has as its intended object the thing as it really is . . .Impurity is an accretion of rajas and tamas. And it is the defilement which hasthe distinguishing characteristic of obscuration. Clearness is freed from this.”(P. 93.)The man has succeeded (through discipline, through following the means of yoga,and through perseverance in meditation) in dissociating himself [104] from allforms, and in identifying himself with the formless.He has arrived at the point at the heart of his being. From that point of purespiritual realisation, he can increasingly work in the future. Through practice,he strengthens that realisation, and all life, work and circumstances are viewedas a passing pageant with which he is not concerned. Upon them, however, he canturn the searchlight of pure spirit; he himself is light and knows himself aspart of the “Light of the World,” and “in that light shall he see light.” Heknows things as they are and realizes that all which he has hitherto regarded asreality is but illusion. He has pierced the great Maya and passed behind it intothe light which produces it and for him mistake is in the future impossible; hissense of values is correct; his sense of proportion is exact. He no longer issubject to deception but stands freed from delusion. When this point isrealized, pain and pleasure no longer affect him; he is lost in the bliss ofSelf-Realization.48. His perception is now unfailingly exact, (or, his mind reveals only theTruth).Both translations are here given, as they seem to give together a truer ideathan either does alone. The word “exact” is used in its occult sense and dealswith the outlook of the Perceiver upon all phenomena. The world of illusion, orthe world of form must be “exactly known.” This means, literally, that therelation of every form to [105] its name or originating word must be appreciatedas it is. At the summation of the evolutionary process every form of divinemanifestation must respond exactly to its name, or to the word which set up theoriginal impulse and so brought a life into being. Therefore the firsttranslation emphasises this idea and the three factors are hinted at.1. The idea,2. The word,3. The resultant form.They also inevitably bring with them another triplicity,1. Time which connects the three,2. Space which produces the three,3. Evolution, the process of production.One result of this is the demonstration of the law and the exact fulfilling ofthe purpose of God. This is realized by the yogi who has succeeded ineliminating all forms from his consciousness and has become aware of that whichlies back of all forms. How he does this is revealed by the second translation.The mind stuff, being now perfectly still and the man being polarized in thatfactor which is not the mind nor any of the sheaths, can transmit to thephysical brain unerringly, accurately and without mistake, that which isperceived in the Light of the Shekinah which streams from the Holy of Holiesinto which the man has succeeded in entering. The truth is known and the causeof every form in all the kingdoms of nature stands revealed. This is therevelation of [106] the true magic and the key to the great magical work inwhich all true yogis and adepts participate.49. This particular perception is unique and reveals that which the rationalmind (using testimony, inference and deduction) cannot reveal.The meaning here might be stated to be that the mind of man in its variousaspects and uses can reveal those things which concern objectivity, but onlyidentification with the spirit can reveal the nature and world of the spirit.“No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom ofthe Father, he hath revealed him.” Until a man knows himself as a Son of God,until the Christ in each man is manifesting and the Christ-life has fullexpression, and until the man is one with that internal spiritual reality whichis his true self, the particular knowledge dealt with here (knowledge of God andof spirit, independent of matter or form) is impossible. The testimony of theages points to a spiritual force or life in the world; the inference to begarnered from the life experience of millions is that spirit exists; thededuction to be gathered from the consideration of the world or of the greatmaya is that a Cause, self-persisting and self-existing, must be back of thatmaya. Only the man, however, who can pass behind all forms and can transcend allthe limitations in the three worlds (mind, emotion and the things of sense, orthe [107] “world, the flesh and the devil”) can know , past all controversy andargument, that God is , and that he himself is God. Then he knows the truth, andthat truth makes him free.The field of knowledge, the instruments of knowledge and knowledge itself aretranscended and the yogi comes to the great recognition that there is nothingexcept God; that His life is one and is to be found pulsating in the microscopicatom and in the macrocosmic atom also. With that life he identifies himself. Hefinds it at the heart of his own being and can there merge himself with the lifeof God as it is found in the ultimate primordial atom, or expand his realizationuntil he knows himself as the life of the solar system.50. It is hostile to, or supersedes all other impressions.Previous to attaining this true perception, the onlooker has been dependent uponthree other methods of ascertaining truth, all of them limited and imperfect.They are:1. Sense perceptions . In this method the dweller in the body ascertains thenature of the objective world through the medium of his five senses. Objectivityor tangibility becomes known to him and he hears, sees, touches, tastes andsmells the things of the physical world. He deals, however, with the effectsproduced by the subjective life, but has no clue to the causes or to thesubjective energies of which they are the product. His interpretation of them isconsequently false, [108] leading to wrong identification and an erroneous setof values.2. Mental perception. Through the use of the mind the onlooker becomes aware ofanother grade of phenomena and is put en rapport with the thought world, or withthat condition of substance in which is registered the thought impulses of ourplanet and its inhabitants, and with forms created by those vibratory impulseswhich express certain ideas and desires,—primarily at present the latter. Owingto the erroneous perception brought about through the use of the senses and thewrong interpretation of the things sensed, these thought forms are in themselvesdistortions of the reality, and express only those lower impulses and reactionswhich emanate from the lower kingdoms in nature. Students should remember thatit is only when man is really beginning to use his mental body (and is not usedby it) that he contacts the thought forms created by the guides of the race andjustly perceives them.3. The super contemplative state. In this condition perception is unfailinglyaccurate and the other modes of vision are seen in their right proportions. Thesenses are no longer required by the onlooker except in so far as he utilizesthem for purposes of constructive work on their respective planes. He is now inpossession of a faculty which safeguards him from error and of a sense whichonly reveals to him things as they are. The conditions governing this stagemight be enumerated as follows: [109]1. The man is polarized in his spiritual nature,2. He recognizes himself and functions as the soul, the Christ,3. He has the chitta or mind stuff in a state of quiescence,4. The sutratma or thread is functioning adequately and the lower bodies arealigned upon it, producing a direct channel of communication with the physicalbrain,5. The brain is trained to serve only as a delicate receiver of truthimpressions,6. The third eye is in process of unfoldment. Later, as the centres are awakenedand brought into conscious control, they place the man en rapport with thevarious energy septenates in the seven planes of the system, and because thetruth-perceiving faculty is developed, the man is thereby safeguarded from errorand from danger.This has been very clearly and ably stated by Charles Johnston in his commentaryon this sutra as follows:“Each state or field of the mind, each field of knowledge, so to speak, which isreached by mental and emotional energies, is a psychical state, just as the mindpicture of a stage with the actors on it, is a psychical state or field. Whenthe pure vision, as of the poet, the philosopher, the saint, fills the wholefield, all lesser views and visions are crowded out. This high consciousnessdisplaces all lesser consciousness. Yet, in a certain sense, that which isviewed as part, even by the vision of a sage, has still an element of illusion,a thin psychical veil, however pure and luminous that [110] veil may be. It isthe last and highest psychic state.”51. When this state of perception is itself also restrained (or superseded),then is pure samadhi achieved.The great teacher Patanjali, having led us through the various stages of theexpanding consciousness, from “seeded” meditation to that in which the sensesand the mind are superseded, carries us into a state for which we have noadequate terminology. The yogi of the East applies the word Samadhi to thatstate of consciousness wherein the world in which the spiritual man functionsand the formless levels or planes of our solar system are contacted, seen andknown. The field of knowledge of the three worlds, the realm of maya and ofillusion, can be contacted at will by the seer using the instrument provided forhim, but a new world opens up in which he sees his consciousness as one with allother energies, or conscious expressions of divine life. The last veil ofillusion is withdrawn, the great heresy of separateness is seen in its truenature, and the seer can say with Christ:“Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on methrough their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and Iin thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thouhast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest [111] me I have given them; thatthey may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may bemade perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, andhast loved them, as thou hast loved me.” (John XVII. 20-23.)"},{"pageContent":"BOOK II - THE STEPS TO UNION...TOPIC: THE MEANS OF ATTAINMENT.[115] 1. The Yoga of action, leading to union with the soul is fiery aspiration,spiritual reading and devotion to Ishvara.2. The aim of these three is to bring about soul vision and to eliminateobstructions.3. These are the difficulty producing hindrances: avidya (ignorance) the senseof personality, desire, hate and the sense of attachment.4. Avidya (ignorance) is the cause of all the other obstructions whether they belatent, in process of elimination, overcome, or in full operation.5. Avidya is the condition of confusing the permanent, pure, blissful and theSelf with that which is impermanent, impure, painful and the not-self.6. The sense of personality is due to the identification of the knower with theinstruments of knowledge.7. Desire is attachment to objects of pleasure.8. Hate is aversion for any object of the senses.9. Intense desire for sentient existence is attachment. This is inherent inevery form, is self-perpetuating, and known even to the very wise.10. These five hindrances, when subtly known, can be overcome by an opposingmental attitude.11. Their activities are to be done away with, through the meditation process.12. Karma itself has its root in these five hindrances and must come to fruitionin this life or in some later life. [116]13. So long as the roots (or samskaras) exist, their fruition will be birth,life, and experiences resulting in pleasure or pain.14. These seeds (or samskaras) produce pleasure or pain according as theiroriginating cause was good or evil.15. To the illuminated man all existence (in the three worlds) is consideredpain owing to the activities of the gunas. These activities are threefold,producing consequences, anxieties and subliminal impressions.16. Pain which is yet to come may be warded off.17. The illusion that the Perceiver and that which is perceived are one and thesame is the cause (of the pain- producing effects) which must be warded off.18. That which is perceived has three qualities, sattva, rajas and tamas(rhythm, mobility and inertia); it consists of the elements and the senseorgans. The use of these produces experience and eventual liberation.19. The divisions of the gunas (or qualities of matter) are fourfold; thespecific, the non-specific, the indicated and the untouchable.20. The seer is pure knowledge (gnosis). Though pure, he looks upon thepresented idea through the medium of the mind.21. All that is exists for the sake of the soul.22. In the case of the man who has achieved yoga (or union) the objectiveuniverse has ceased to be. Yet it existeth still for those who are not yet free.23. The association of the soul with the mind and thus with that which the mindperceives, produces an understanding of the nature of that which is perceivedand likewise of the Perceiver.24. The cause of this association is ignorance or avidya. This has to beovercome.25. When ignorance is brought to an end through non-association with the thingsperceived, this is the great liberation.26. The state of bondage is overcome through perfectly maintaineddiscrimination. [117]27. The knowledge (or illumination) achieved is seven-fold and is attainedprogressively.28. When the means to yoga have been steadily practised, and when impurity hasbeen overcome, enlightenment takes place, leading up to full illumination.29. The eight means of yoga are, the Commandments or Yama, the Rules or Nijama,posture or Asana, right control of life-force or Pranayama, abstraction orPratyahara, attention or Dharana, Meditation or Dhyana, Contemplation orSamadhi.30. Harmlessness, truth to all beings, abstention from theft, from incontinenceand from avarice, constitute yama or the five commandments.81. Yama (or the five commandments) constitutes the universal duty and isirrespective of race, place, time or emergency.32. Internal and external purification, contentment, fiery aspiration, spiritualreading and devotion to Ishvara constitutes nijama (or the five rules).33. When thoughts which are contrary to yoga are present there should be thecultivation of their opposite.34. Thoughts contrary to yoga are harmfulness, falsehood, theft, incontinence,and avarice, whether committed personally, caused to be committed or approvedof, whether arising from avarice, anger or delusion (ignorance); whether slightin the doing, middling or great. These result always in excessive pain andignorance. For this reason, the contrary thoughts must be cultivated.35. In the presence of him who has perfected harmlessness, all enmity ceases.36. When truth to all beings is perfected, the effectiveness of his words andacts is immediately to be seen.37. When abstention from theft is perfected, the yogi can have whatever hedesires.38. By abstention from incontinence, energy is acquired.39. When abstention from avarice is perfected, there comes an understanding ofthe law of rebirth. [118]40. Internal and external purification produces aversion for form, both one’sown and all forms.41. Through purification comes also a quiet spirit, concentration, conquest ofthe organs, and ability to see the Self.42. As a result of contentment bliss is achieved.43. Through fiery aspiration and through the removal of all impurity, comes theperfecting of the bodily powers and of the senses.44. Spiritual reading results in a contact with the soul (or divine One).45. Through devotion to Ishvara the goal of meditation (or samadhi) is reached.46. The posture assumed must be steady and easy.47. Steadiness and ease of posture is to be achieved through persistent slighteffort and through the concentration of the mind upon the infinite.48. When this is attained, the pairs of opposites no longer limit.49. When right posture (asana) has been attained there follows right control ofprana and proper inspiration and expiration of the breath.50. Right control of prana (or the life currents) is external, internal ormotionless; it is subject to place, time and number and is also protracted orbrief.51. There is a fourth stage which transcends those dealing with the internal andexternal phases.52. Through this, that which obscures the light is gradually removed.53. And the mind is prepared for concentrated meditation.54. Abstraction (or Pratyahara) is the subjugation of the senses by the thinkingprinciple and their withdrawal from that which has hitherto been their object.55. As a result of these means there follows the complete subjugation of thesense organs. [119]THE FIVE HINDRANCES AND THEIR REMOVAL1. The yoga of action, leading to union with the soul is fiery aspiration,spiritual reading and devotion to Ishvara.We must here bear in mind that we are beginning the book which outlines thepractical part of the work, which gives the rules which must be followed if theaspirant hopes to achieve, and which indicates those methods which will bringabout the realization of spiritual consciousness. The objective has been dealtwith in Book I. The aspirant naturally says on concluding Book I, “how desirableand how right, but how shall this be? What must I do? Where shall I begin?”Patanjali starts at the very beginning and in this second book he indicates:1. The basic personality requirements,2. The hindrances which can then be noted by the earnest disciple,3. The eight “means of yoga” or the eight kinds of activity which will bringabout the needed results. [120]The very simplicity of this outline makes its value exceedingly great; there isno confusion, no complex dissertations, but just a clear simple statement of therequirements.It might be of value here if we dealt with the various “yogas” so as to give tothe student a clear concept as to their distinctions and thus cultivate hisdiscrimination. The principal yogas are three in number, the various otherso-called “yogas” finding their place in one of these three groups:1. Raja Yoga the yoga of the mind or will, 2. Bhakti Yoga the yoga of the heartor the devotee, 3. Karma Yoga the yoga of action.Raja Yoga stands by itself and is the king science of them all; it is thesummation of all the others, it is the climax and that which completes the workof development in the human kingdom. It is the science of the mind and of thepurposeful will, and brings the higher of man’s sheaths in the three worldsunder the subjection of the Inner Ruler. This science coordinates the entirelower threefold man, forcing him into a position where he is nothing but thevehicle for the soul, or God within. It includes the other yogas and profits bytheir achievements. It synthesises the work of evolution and crowns man as king.Bhakti Yoga is the yoga of the heart; it is the bringing into submission of allthe feelings, desires [121] and emotions, to the one beloved, seen and known inthe heart. It is the sublimation of all the lower loves and the bringing captiveof all longings and desire, to the one longing to know the God of love and thelove of God.It was the “kingly” or crowning science of the last rootrace, the Atlantean,just as the science of Raja Yoga is the great science of our Aryan civilization.Bhakti Yoga made its exponent an arhat or led him to the fourth initiation. RajaYoga makes him an adept and leads him to the portal of the fifth initiation.Both lead to liberation, for the arhat is released from the cycle of rebirth butRaja Yoga liberates him to complete service and freedom to work as a WhiteMagician. Bhakti Yoga is the yoga of the heart, of the astral body.Karma Yoga has a specific relation to physical plane activity, and to theworking out into objective manifestation of all the inner impulses. In itsancient and simplest form it was the yoga of the third or Lemurian root race andits two best known expressions are:a. Hatha Yoga,b. Laya Yoga.The former has specifically to do with the physical body, its conscious (notsubconscious and automatic) functioning and all the various practices which giveman control over the different organs and the entire mechanical apparatus of thephysical body. The latter has to do with the etheric body, with the forcecenters or chakras [122] found in that body and with the distribution of forcecurrents and the awakening of the serpent fire.It might be pointed out that if we divide the human torso into three departmentsit might be stated that:1. Karma Yoga resulted in the awakening of the four centres below the diaphragm,2. Bhakti Yoga resulted in their transmutation and transference into the twocentres above the diaphragm, yet in the torso, the heart and the throat.3. Raja Yoga synthesises all the forces of the body in the head and from theredistributes and controls them.Raja Yoga, which Patanjali primarily deals with, includes the effects of all theothers. It is only possible when the others have been worked with, but not inthe sense of working with them in this life. Evolution has brought all the sonsof men (who are ready to be chelas or disciples), through the various races, andwhilst in the Lemurian race (or else on the preceding chain or greater cycle)they were all hatha and laya yogins. This resulted in the development andcontrol of the dual physical body, dense and etheric.Whilst in the Atlantean race the desire or astral body was developed, and theflower of that race were true sons of bhakti yoga and true devotees. Now thehighest of the three bodies must be brought to its fullest development and thisRaja Yoga is intended to do and this is the object of Patanjali’s work. TheAryan race will [123] contribute this fuller development to the general economy,and the entire human family (with the exception of a percentage which enteredthe race too late to permit of the full flowering of the soul) will manifest asSons of God with all the powers of the God unfolded and consciously used on thephysical plane and in the physical body. Patanjali says that three things willbring this about, coupled with the following of certain methods and rules, andthese three are:1. Fiery aspiration, the domination of the physical man so that every atom ofhis body is afire with zeal and endeavor,2. Spiritual reading, which has reference to the capacity of the mental body tosee back of a symbol or to touch the subject lying back of the object,3. Devotion to Ishvara, which relates to the astral or emotional body , thewhole heart poured out in love to God—God in his own heart, God in the heart ofhis brother, and God as seen in every form.Fiery aspiration is the sublimation of karma yoga. Devotion to Ishvara is thesublimation of bhakti yoga, whilst spiritual reading is the first step to RajaYoga.“Devotion to Ishvara” is a large and general term covering the relation of thepersonal self to the higher self, the Ishvara or Christ principle in the heart.It covers also the relation of the individual Ishvara to the universal or cosmicIshvara; it deals with the realization of the soul in man that it is an integralpart of the Oversoul. This [124] results in group consciousness which is theobjective of the kingly science.Devotion involves certain factors which it is valuable for the devotee torealize.1. A capacity to decentralize oneself, to change one’s attitude fromself-centredness and selfishness to one of outgoing to the loved one. All thingsare counted as loss provided the object of one’s devotion is attained.2. Obedience to the beloved object once that beloved is known. This has beencalled in some translations “complete obedience to the Master” and this is thetrue and accurate translation but in view of the fact that the word Masterconnotes (to the occult student) one of the adepts, we have chosen to translatethe word as “Ishvara,” the one God in the heart of man, the divine Jiva or“point of divine life” at the centre of man’s being. This is the same in allmen, whether savage or adept; the difference only lies in degree ofmanifestation and of control. Complete obedience to any guru or mahatma in thesense of complete subjugation of the will is never taught in the true science ofyoga. Subjugation of the lower man to the will of the inner God is taught andall the methods and rules of yoga are to this specific end. This should becarefully borne in mind. “Spiritual reading” is the most significant and occultpreliminary thereto.Every form is the result of thought and of sound. Every form veils or concealsan idea or concept. Every form, therefore, is but the symbol or attemptedrepresentation of an idea and [125] this is true without exception on all theplanes of our solar system, wherein forms are found whether created by God, manor deva.One object of a disciple’s training is to enable him to ascertain that whichlies back of any form in any kingdom of nature and thus ascertain the nature ofthe spiritual energy which brought it into being. The vastness of this cosmicsymbolism will be apparent to even the most superficial thinker and the beginnerupon the path of chelaship has to learn to separate the many forms into certainspecific groups standing for certain basic ideas. He has to interpret the ideaslying back of specific symbols, and he has to look for the specific impulselatent in every form. He can begin practically to do this in the environment andin the place where he is. He can look for the idea which his brother’s formveils; he can search for God behind the body of any and every man.Thus the sutra under consideration takes the aspirant into the most practicalpart of life; it brings him face to face with three basic enquiries and as heseeks to answer them aright, he will inevitably equip himself to tread the path.These three enquiries are:1. Towards what objective do all the longings and aspirations of my soul trend,towards God, or to things material?2. Am I bringing my entire lower nature under the control of Ishvara or the truespiritual man?3. Do I see God back of every form and circumstance in my daily contacts? [126]2. The aim of these three is to bring about soul vision and to eliminateobstructions.It is interesting to note here that the words “soul vision” precede the thoughtof the eliminated hindrances or obstructions, showing that the vision ispossible even to those who have not yet perfected themselves. The vision comesin those moments of exaltation and high aspiration to which most of the sons ofmen are susceptible and provides the incentive needed to produce thatdetermination and perseverance which the elimination of the obstructionnecessitates. The words “elimination of the obstructions” or the “alteration ofthe hindrances” (as it is sometimes translated), is a large and genericexpression and Hindu commentators point out that it involves even theeradication of the seeds of those hindrances, and their total destruction as byfire; that just as a burnt, dried up seed is no longer capable of propagationand becomes unfertile, producing no growth, so the seeds of the obstructions tothe life of the Spirit are similarly rendered unfertile. These seeds are foundin three groups, each producing a large crop of hindrances or obstructions onthe three planes of man’s evolution—the seeds latent in the physical body, thoseproducing the obstructions of the astral body, and the seeds latent in themental body. They are of three kinds in each case, making literally nine typesor kinds of seeds:1. Seeds brought over from previous lives,2. Seeds sown in this life, [127]3. Seeds brought into the field of one’s life from the family or race with whichone is allied.It is these seeds which produce the obstructions or hindrances to soul visionand the free play of spiritual energy and Patanjali says they are of five kindsand proceeds to deal with them specifically. By some commentators the word istranslated distractions, and all three terms are equally correct and any of themcan be used. It may perhaps be pointed out that:1. The word “obstruction” is more technically correct when applied to thephysical plane,2. The word “hindrance” is more illuminating when applied to those things which,through the medium of the astral body, prevent soul vision,3. The word “distraction” has more specific reference to the difficulties whichassail the man who seeks to quiet the mind and so achieve soul vision.3. These are the difficulty producing hindrances: avidya (ignorance), and thesense of personality, desire, hate and the sense of attachment.These are the five wrong ideas or concepts which for aeons of time andthroughout many lives, prevent the sons of men from realizing that they are sonsof God. It is these concepts which lead men to identify themselves with thatwhich is lower and material, and to forget the divine realities. It is thesemisconceptions which make a prodigal son of the divine Monad, and which send[128] him forth into the far country to eat of the husks of mortal existence. Itis these which must be overcome and eliminated before a man can “lift up hiseyes” and see again the vision of the Father and the Father’s Home and so beenabled to tread consciously the Path of return.It might be pointed out that two of the hindrances, avidya and sense ofpersonality, relate to man, the synthesis upon the physical plane, that desirehas relation to his astral body or vehicle of feeling, and that hate and a senseof attachment are products of the sense of egoism (the ahamkara principle) whichanimate the mental body. Thus the threefold personality is the field for theseeds and in the soil of the personal life in the three worlds do these seedspropagate and flourish and grow up to obstruct and hinder the real man. Theseseeds must be destroyed, and in their destruction three things eventuate:1. Karma is worked off,2. Liberation is achieved,3. The vision of the soul is perfected.4. Avidya (ignorance) is the cause of all the other obstructions, whether theybe latent, in process of elimination, overcome, or in full operation.The comprehensiveness of this sutra is the first thing which attracts one’sattention. It carries one in thought to the root cause of all evil and in itsreference to the obstructions covers all possible conditions of their being.This verse sums [129] up the condition of every man from the savage stage upthrough all intervening conditions to the state of arhatship, in which the finalfetters of ignorance are cast off. It states that the reason evil exists, thereason selfishness and personal desires of any kind are evident, is found in thegreat basic condition which is the limitation of form itself, avidya orignorance.The aspirant is reminded right at the beginning of his investigations into thelaws of spiritual unfoldment, that two factors must be taken into account whichare based on the fact of manifestation itself:1. The fact of the not-self towards which the divine points of spiritual lifeare attracted, and which in the period of evolution absorbs them,2. The fact of the limitations which form-taking necessitates.The above two factors must be recognized as true of the solar Logos, theplanetary Logos, a man or an atom. Every form of divine life (theinfinitesimally small and the infinitely great) veils or hides a fraction ofspiritual energy. The result to the point of spiritual existence is necessarilya shutting in, a cutting off, and a circumscribing of itself, and only thecontacts of existence itself and the struggle of the spiritual unit within theform can bring about, eventual release.For the time being and during the process of incarnation, the veiled point oflife remains in ignorance of that which lies outside of itself and progressivelyhas to fight its way out to ever increasing freedom and liberty. [130]First the sphere of its own form is the sole thing it is aware of and it remainsin ignorance of all outside of itself. The contacts, brought about by desire,are the factors whereby ignorance works out into knowledge, and the man (for wewill only consider the human unit in this connection, though the basic laws holdgood for all forms of divine life) gradually becomes aware of himself as he isand conscious of his environment. As this environment is triple (physical,astral and mental) and as he has three vehicles whereby he can contact the threeworlds, the period covered in this awakening is immense. The old commentary saysin this connection:“In the Hall of Ignorance the triple sheaths are known. The solar life at itsdensest point is contacted and man emerges fully human.”Then the man becomes aware of something else, the group to which he belongs, andhe does this through a finding of his own inner reality as latent in hispersonality. He learns that he, the human atom is a part of a group or centre inthe body of a heavenly Man, a planetary Logos and that he must develop awarenessof:a. His group vibration,b. His group purpose,c. His group centre.This is the stage of the probationary path or the Path of Discipleship up to thethird initiation, and the old commentary proceeds:“Within the Hall of Learning, the central mystery is contacted. The method ofrelease is seen, the law is well fulfilled, and man emerges well-nigh adept.”[131]Finally, the man enters the Hall of Wisdom to which he was admitted occasionally(and with increasing frequency) after the first great initiation, and learns ofthe place his group holds in the planetary plan, catching a glimpse also of thecosmic scheme. Ignorance (as we understand the term) is, of course, negated, butit cannot be too frequently emphasized that there remains much unknown even tothe adept, and that the Christ Himself, the great World Teacher, knows not allthat is the content of the awareness of the King of the World. The Yoga Sutrasof Patanjali only deal, however, with the overcoming of the ignorance whichholds a man upon the wheel of rebirth and which prevents him unfolding the truepowers of the soul. The old commentary says in connection with this final stage:“Within the Hall of Wisdom, light fully shines upon the adept’s ways. He knowsand sees the seventh part and visions all the rest. He is himself a septenateand from this Hall emerges God.”5. Avidya is the condition of confusing the permanent, pure, blissful and theSelf, with that which is impermanent, impure, painful and the not-self.This condition of ignorance, or the “state of avidya” is characteristic of allthose who as yet do not discriminate between the real and unreal, between deathand immortality, and between light and darkness. It governs, therefore, life inthe three worlds, for the correspondence between [132] avidya on the physicalplane as experienced by man in incarnation is to be found on all planes. It is alimitation of Spirit itself and a necessary corollary of form-taking. Thespiritual unit is born blind and senseless. It comes into form at the beginningof the ages and cycles of rebirth in a state of total unawareness. It has tobecome aware of that which is around it; to do this it has first to develop thesenses whereby contact and awareness become possible. The method and processthrough which the human being has evolved five senses or avenues of approach tothe not-self are well known and any standard physiological text book can supplythe needed information. Three factors must be borne in mind in connection withthe spiritual unit:1. The senses have to be evolved,2. Their recognition and use must follow,3. A period succeeds wherein the spiritual man utilizes the senses in thefulfillment of his desire, and in so doing identifies himself with his apparatusof manifestation.He is doubly blind, for he is not only born blind and senseless but he ismentally blinded also, and does not see himself or things as they are but makesthe mistake of regarding himself as the material form, and this he does for manycycles. He has no sense of values or of proportion but looks upon the transient,suffering, unclean, material, lower man (his three sheaths in their totality) ashimself, the reality, He cannot dissociate himself from his forms. The sensesare part of the forms; they are not the spiritual man, the [133] dweller in theform. They are part of the not-self and the medium of its contact with theplanetary not-self.Through discrimination and dispassion the self, who is permanent, pure, andblissful, can eventually dissociate itself from the not-self which isimpermanent, impure, and full of pain. When this is not realized, the man is ina condition of avidya. When it is in process of accomplishment, the man is afollower of vidya or knowledge, a fourfold path. When the soul is known as it isand the not-self is relegated to its rightful place as a sheath, vehicle orimplement, then knowledge itself is transcended and the knower stands alone.This is liberation and the goal.6. The sense of personality is due to the identification of the knower with theinstruments of knowledge.This verse is the commentary upon the previous one. The student should rememberthat the knower, the spiritual man, has various instruments for contacting hisenvironment and thus becoming increasingly aware:1. His three sheaths or bodies which are his medium of contact on three planes:a. The physical body,b. The emotional or astral body,c. The mental body.2. On the physical plane he has his five senses, hearing, touch, sight, tasteand smell. [134]3. The mind, the great sixth sense which has a triple use. As yet for themajority of men it has but one use:Its first and commonest use is a gathering of the realized contacts together andtheir transmission as information to the ego or knower, much in the same way asthe nervous system telegraphs to the brain the external contacts it makes. It isthis use of the mind which produces primarily the sense of personality whichbegins to fade out as the other uses become possible.A second use of the mind is the one which the first five means of yoga bringabout—the power to transmit to the brain the thoughts, wishes and will of theego or soul. This brings into the personal self on the physical plane arecognition of the reality and the sense of identification with the not-selfbecomes steadily less.The third use of the mind is its use by the soul as an organ of vision wherebythe realm of the soul itself is contacted and known. The final three means ofyoga bring this about.It should be emphasized that this is a most important fact to note. If theaspirant will regard the development and full use of the sixth sense as hisimmediate objective, and will bear in mind the three purposes for which it isintended, he will make rapid progress, the sense of personality will fade awayand identification with the soul will ensue. This is one of the greatest of thefetters which hold the sons of men captive. It is here that the axe must be laidto the root of the tree. [135]7. Desire is attachment to objects of pleasure.This is not a literal translation by any means but gives the basic idea soclearly that it is best to translate the sutra as above.These objects of pleasure cover all the attachments which a man forms from thesavage state of infant humanity up to advanced degrees of discipleship; theycover desire for gross objects on the physical plane as well as attachment tothose things, occupations and reactions which the emotions or intellectualpursuits will offer; they cover the whole gamut or range of sensuous experiencefrom the response of the savage to warmth and a good meal to the rapture of themystic. Desire is a generic term covering the outgoing tendency of spirittowards form life. It may mean the delight of a cannibal for that which he eats,the love of a man for his family, the appreciation of the artist for a beautifulpainting, or the adoration of the devotee for Christ or his guru. It is allattachment in some degree or another, and the progress of the soul seems to bein this dispensation from one object of sense to another until that time comeswhen he is thrown back alone upon himself. He has exhausted all objects ofattachment, and even his guru seems to have left him alone. Only one reality isleft, that spiritual reality which is himself, and his desire then turns inward.It is no longer outgoing but he finds the kingdom of God within. All desire thenleaves him. He makes contacts, and continues to manifest [136] and work upon theplanes of illusion but he works from the centre where dwells his divine self,the sum total of all desire, and there is nothing to lure him forth into thebyways of pleasure or of pain.8. Hate is aversion for any object of the senses.This sutra is the reverse of the preceding one. The true yogi neither feelsaversion or desire. He is balanced between these pairs of opposites. Hate causesseparation, whereas love reveals the unity underlying all forms. Hate is theresult of concentration upon form and of a forgetfulness of that which everyform (in more or less degree) reveals; hate is the feeling of repulsion andleads to a withdrawal of the man from the object hated; hate is the reverse ofbrotherhood and therefore is the breaking of one of the basic laws of the solarsystem. Hate negates unity, causes barriers to be built and produces thosecauses which lead to crystallization, destruction and death. It is energy usedto repudiate instead of to synthesize and therefore runs counter to the law ofevolution.Hate is really the result of the sense of personality and of ignorance plusmisapplied desire. It is almost the culmination of the other three. It was thesense of personality and of extreme ignorance coupled with desire for personalgain which produced hatred of Abel in the heart of Cain and caused the firstmurder, or the destruction of a brother’s form. This should be carefullyconsidered, [137] for hate in some degree, aversion to some extent, is presentin every human heart. Only, however, when it is entirely overcome by love or thesense of unity will death, danger and fear pass out of the ken of the humanfamily.9. Intense desire for sentient existence is attachment. This is inherent inevery form, is self-perpetuating, and known even to the very wise.This form of attachment is the basic cause of all manifestation. It is inherentin the relationship of the two great opposites, spirit and matter; it is thegoverning factor in logoic manifestation and this is the reason why even “thevery wise” are subject to it. This form of attachment is an automaticself-reproducing, self-perpetuating faculty, and it should be remembered thatthe overcoming of this tendency, even when carried to its highest stage by theadept, is but a relative overcoming. As long as the Logos of our solar system,or the Absolute Spirit, incarnates through the medium of a solar system, thistendency will be present in the highest planetary Spirit and the most elevatedspiritual existence. All that is possible in overcoming attachment, or killingout desire, is to develop the power to balance the pairs of opposites on anyparticular plane so that one is no longer held by the forms of that plane andwithdrawal becomes possible. Very secondary meanings are given by the ordinarystudent to the words attachment, desire, and their killing out. They areinterpreted in terms of the student’s [138] small advancement. They are butEnglish words which most inadequately and only symbolically seek to express anoccult work. They can only be truly understood in terms of the law of Attractionand Repulsion and through an understanding of the system of occult vibrations.The will to live or to manifest is part of the divine Life impulse, andtherefore is right. The will to be or to manifest upon any specific plane orthrough any specific group of forms is not right when that sphere ofmanifestation is out-grown, and when any peculiar set of forms have served theirpurpose of providing media for experience-contacts and can teach no furtherlessons, evil enters in, for a tendency to evil is but a tendency to revert tothe use of forms and practices which the Indweller has outgrown. For thisreason, the gross animal sins are universally regarded as evil because it isgenerally recognized that the dweller in the form of man has outgrown the thirdor animal kingdom.An adept, therefore, has transcended attachment to forms on three planes(physical, astral and mental) and has killed out all longing for the forms ofthose planes. When the life or Spirit withdraws itself, the form dies, occultly.When the thought of the ego or higher self is occupied with its own plane, thereis no energy outgoing towards the matter of the three worlds and so noform-building and form-attachment is there possible. This is in line with theoccult truism that “energy follows thought,” and in line too with the teachingthat the body of the Christ principle, [139] (the buddhic vehicle) only beginsto coordinate as the lower impulses fade out. It is consistent also with thefact that the causal vehicle, the body of the higher self on the abstract levelsof the mental plane gains in beauty, size and activity with greater rapidityduring the stages of discipleship than was previously possible in the entirecycle of previous incarnations. Egoic energy is not strictly outgoing, but isdirected more literally to its own self-development. Attachment to form or theattraction of form for Spirit is the great involutionary impulse. Repulsion ofform and consequent form disintegration is the great evolutionary urge.10. These five hindrances, when subtly known, can be overcome by an opposingmental attitude.The words “subtly known” could be paraphrased as “when realized by the innerman,” and the thought back of the words has been well explained by Dvivedi inhis Comment as follows:“Having described the nature of ‘distractions,’ the author points out the way tosuppress them. They are divided into two kinds, subtle and gross. The first arethose which exist in a dormant condition in the form of impressions, whereas thesecond are those that are concretely affecting the mind. The first can becompletely suppressed only by gaining mastery over the whole of their support,viz. the thinking principle.” [140]This is the first work of the aspirant to yoga. He must realize the nature ofthe obstacles and then set in to overcome them, doing the work from the mentalplane. He has to gain control of the apparatus of thought; then he has to learnhow to use that apparatus, and when this has been accomplished, he begins tooffset the hindrances by counter currents. The hindrances themselves are theresult of wrong habits of thought and the misuse of the thinking principle. Whenthey are subtly known as the seeds which produce the “obstacle-producing forms,”then they can be exterminated in the latent stages by right habits of thoughtresulting in the setting up of the liberty-producing means.Ignorance (avidya) must be supplanted by the true vidya or knowledge, and as iswell-known, in this fourth race on this fourth globe and in the fourth round,the four vidyas and the four noble truths and the four basic elements form thesum total of this knowledge.The four vidyas of the Hindu philosophy might be enumerated as follows:1. Yajna Vidya.—The performance of religious rites in order to produce certainresults. Ceremonial magic. Is concerned with sound, therefore with the Akasa orthe ether of space. The “Yajna” is the invisible deity who pervades space.2. Mahavidya.—The great magic knowledge. It has degenerated into Tantrikaworship. Deals with the feminine aspect, or the matter (mother) aspect. Thebasis of black magic. True maha-yoga [141] has to do with the form (2nd aspect)and its adaptation to Spirit and its needs.3. Guhya vidya.—The science of mantrams. The secret knowledge of mysticmantrams. The occult potency of sound, of the Word.4. Atman vidya.—True spiritual wisdom.The four noble truths have been stated for us in the words of the Buddha in thefollowing terms:“Now the Exalted One thus addressed the brethren:‘Through not understanding, through not penetrating the Four Aryan Truths,brethren, we have run on and wandered round this long, long journey (orrebirth), both you and I. What are those four?The Aryan Truth of Ill: the Aryan Truth of the Arising of Ill: the Aryan Truthof the Ceasing of Ill: the Aryan Truth of the Way leading to the Ceasing of Ill.But, brethren, when these Four Aryan Truths are understood and penetrated, thenis uprooted the craving for existence, cut off is the thread that leadeth torebirth, then is there no more coming to be.’Thus spake the Exalted One. When the Happy One had thus spoken, the Master addedthis further:Blind to the Fourfold Aryan Truths of things,And blind to see things as they really are,Long was our journeying thro’ divers births.Gone is the cord of life when these are seen.No more becoming when Ill’s root is cut.”The four elements have been stated for us in the following extract from theSecret Doctrine (I. 95):“The Golden Egg was surrounded by seven natural Elements, four ready (ether,fire, air, water), three secret.” [142]11. Their activities are to be done away with through the meditation process.The “opposing mental attitude” referred to in the previous sutra has distinctreference to the seeds or the latent tendencies as they subsist in the mentalbody and in the body of desire. This mental attitude has to become one of activemental meditation and one-pointed thought if the activities of the physical bodyare to be subjected to a like control. Much that we do is automatic and theresult of long continued emotional and mental habits. Instinctively, fromancient practice and through subjection to a world of tangible forms, ourphysical plane activities are governed by the five hindrances. These have to besuppressed and the work of dealing with the latent seeds and with suppressingthe external activities must proceed simultaneously. The steady opposition ofthe mental attitude deals with one; meditation which brings in the three factorsof the thinker, the mind and the physical brain will take care of the other, andthis must not be forgotten, otherwise theory will not become intelligentpractice. This meditation process is dealt with in Book III and need not beenlarged upon here.12. Karma itself has its root in these five hindrances and must come to fruitionin this life or in some later life.Just as long as man on the physical plane is subject to, or governed by thesehindrances, just [143] so long will he initiate those activities which willproduce inevitable effects, and just so long will he be tied to the wheel ofrebirth and be condemned to form-taking. The student should carefully note thatthese five hindrances are the cause of all the activities of the lowerpersonality or the lower man. Everything he does is based on one or other ofthem and there is no action of the average man in the three worlds which is notthe outcome of ignorance and its accompanying erroneous identifications andreactions.As the hindrances are overcome and ignorance, the field of them all, issuperseded by divine wisdom, there are fewer and fewer effects to work out onthe physical plane, and the chains which link a man to the great wheel ofphysical manifestation are severed one by one. These chains are triple just asthe field of ignorance is triple, being the three great planes of consciousnesswhich are the field of human evolution. When the field of ignorance becomes thefield of conscious experience and when the chains are felt to be fetters andlimitations, the would be chela has made a tremendous step forward in theliberating process. When he can carry the struggle inward into what GanganathaJha calls “the unmanifested life” and which we frequently call “the subtlerplanes” he is entering the Hall of Learning and is severing those fetters whichkama (or desire) and the wrong use of the mind have so subtly forged. Later hewill enter the Hall of Wisdom and be taught certain esoteric and occult methodsof hastening the liberating process. [144]13. So long as the roots (or samkaras) exist, their fruition will be birth,life, and experiences resulting in pleasure or pain.The predominant work of the occult student is the manipulation of force, and theentering of that world wherein forces are actively set in motion which result inphenomenal effects. He has to study and comprehend practically and intelligentlythe working of the law of Cause and Effect, and he leaves off dealing witheffects and centres his attention on their producing causes. In relation tohimself, he comes to realise that the primary cause of the phenomenon of hisobjective existence in the three worlds is the ego itself, and that thesecondary causes are the aggregate of those fundamental egoic impulses whichhave led to the development of response to sense contacts on the three planes.These impulses have produced effects which (being under the law) must work outinto objectivity on the physical plane. Therefore there is much importanceattached to the necessity for establishing direct egoic contact, via the threador sutratma, for only in this way can the aspirant ascertain the causes lyingback of the present manifestations of his life, or begin to deal with thesamkaras or seeds of his future activities. These seeds are kama-manasic (orpartially emotional and partially mental) in nature, for desire is potent in itseffects and produces the physical vehicle in its two aspects.a. Lower manas, or concrete mind is the basic factor in the production of theetheric body. [145]b. Kama, or desire is the prime factor in calling the dense physical vehicleinto being.The two together are responsible for manifested existence.It is well known that the tree of life is depicted with the roots above and theflowering leaves downwards. In the tiny tree of life of the ego the samesymbolic presentation holds true. The roots are found on the mental plane. Theflowering forth into objectivity and fruition is to be seen on the physicalplane. Therefore it is necessary for the aspirant to lay the axe to the root ofthe tree, or to deal with the thoughts and desires which produce the physicalbody. He must enter the subjective realm if he wants to deal with that whichwill continue to keep him on the wheel of rebirth. When the seeds areeradicated, fruition is not possible. When the root is separated from itsexternalities on any of the three planes, then the life-energy no longer flowsdownwards. The three words birth, life and experience sum up human existence,its object, method and goal and with them we need not deal. The whole subject ofkarma (or the law of Cause and Effect) is dealt with in this sutra, and is oftoo vast a subject to be enlarged upon here. Suffice it to say that, from thestandpoint of the Yoga Sutras, karma is of three kinds:1. Latent Karma. Those seeds and causes which are yet undeveloped and inactiveand must work out to fruition in some part of the present or subsequent lives.2. Active Karma . Those seeds or causes [146] which are in process of fruitionand for which the present life is intended to provide the needed soil for theflowering forth.3. New Karma . Those seeds or causes which are being produced in this life, andwhich must inevitably govern the circumstances of some future life.The beginner in this science of yoga can begin dealing with his active karma,interpreting each life-event and every circumstance as providing conditionswherein he can work off a certain specified series of effects. He can endeavorso to watch his thoughts that new seeds are not sown so that no future karma canbe brought to fruition in some later life.The seeds of latent karma are more difficult for the neophyte to work with andit is here that his Master can help him—manipulating his circumstances anddealing with his surroundings in the three worlds in order that this type ofkarma may more quickly work out and be done with.14. These seeds (or samskaras) produce pleasure or pain according as theiroriginating cause was good or evil.It might be noted that good is that which relates to the one principle, to thereality indwelling all forms, to the Spirit of man as it reveals itself throughthe soul, and to the Father as He manifests through the Son. Evil relates to theform, to the vehicle, and to matter and really concerns the relation of the Sonto his body of manifestation. If the Son of God (cosmic or human) is [147]limited, and imprisoned and blinded by his form, that is the power of evil overhim. If he is aware of his own self, unfettered by forms, and free from thethralldom of matter that is the power of good. Complete freedom from mattercauses bliss or pleasure—the joy of realisation. Evil causes pain, for just inso far as the Inner Ruler is limited by his body of manifestation just so fardoes he suffer.15. To the illuminated man all existence (in the three worlds) is consideredpain owing to the activities of the gunas. These activities are threefold,producing consequences, anxieties and subliminal impressions.The three “gunas” are the three qualities of matter itself, sattva, raja andtamas, or rhythm, activity and inertia, and are inherent in all forms. Thestudent needs to remember that every form on every plane is thus characterised,and this is true of the highest form as of the lowest, the manifestation ofthese qualities only differing in degree.To the man who is achieving perfection it becomes increasingly apparent howevery form through which he, the divine spiritual man is manifesting, causeslimitation and difficulty. The physical vehicle of the adept, though constructedof substance predominatingly sattvic in nature, equilibrised and rhythmic, yetserves to confine him to the world of physical endeavor and limits the powers ofthe true man. Speaking generally it might be said that: [148]1. The attribute of inertia (or tamas) characterises the lower personal self,the sheaths of the threefold lower man.2. The attribute of activity is the prime characteristic of the soul, and it isthis quality which causes the intense activity and constant labor of the man ashe seeks experience and later, as he seeks to serve.3. The attribute of rhythm, or balance, is the quality of the spirit or monadand it is this tendency to perfection which is the cause of man’s evolution intime and space and the factor which carries all life through all forms to theconsummation. Let us bear in mind here, however, that these three qualities arethe qualities of the substance through which the triple spirit is manifesting inthis solar system. The nature of spirit itself we know not as yet, for we cannotthink except in terms of form, however, transcendental those forms may be. Onlythose souls who have attained the highest initiation and can pass beyond oursolar ring-pass-not know somewhat of the essential nature of that which we callspirit.Coming to the practical manifestation of the gunas in the three worlds (inrelation to man) it can be noted that:1. The attribute of balance or rhythm distinguishes the mental vehicle. When themental body is organized and man is being directed by his mind, his life becomesstabilised and organized also and the direction of his affairs proceeds in abalanced manner.2. The quality of activity or mobility is the [149] characteristic of theemotional or astral nature and, when this is dominant the life is chaotic,violent, emotional and subjected to every mood and feeling. It is primarily thequality of the desire life.3. Inertia is the quality dominating the physical body and the whole objectiveof the ego is to break down that inertia and drive its lowest vehicle into anactivity which will bring about the desired ends. Hence the use and necessityfor the guna of mobility and the full play of the emotional or desire nature inthe earlier stages of endeavor.Pain is the product of these form activities, for pain is the result of theinherent difference between the pairs of opposites, spirit and matter. Both thefactors are “at peace” essentially until brought into conjunction and bothresist each other and produce friction and suffering when united in time andspace.Patanjali points out that this pain is comprehensive, covering past, present andfuture.1. Consequences . Pain is brought about through the activity of the past and theworking out of karma as it is expressed in the adjusting of mistakes, the payingof the price of error. The settling of past obligations and debts is ever asorrowful process. Certain past eventualities necesitate present conditions bothof heredity, environment and type of body, and the form, both of vehicle andgroup relations, is painful to the soul, who is confined thereby.2. Anxieties . This concerns the present and [150] is sometimestranslated—apprehensions. If the student will study this term he will note thatit covers not only the fear of evil in suffering, but also the fear of failurein the spiritual body in service. These equally cause pain and distress andparallel the awakening of the real man to a realisation of his heritage.3. Subliminal impressions, has relation to the future and concerns thoseforebodings as to death, suffering and need which dominate so many of the sonsof men. It is the unknown and its possibilities that we fear both for ourselvesand others, and this in its turn produces pain.16. Pain which is yet to come may be warded off.The Sanskrit words here give a twofold idea. They infer first of all thatcertain types of coming “misery” (as some translations give it) may be avoidedby a right adjustment of a man’s energies so that through his changed attitudeof mind, painful reactions are no longer possible, and through the transmutationof his desires old “pains” are impossible. It infers secondly that life will beso lived in the present that no causes will be set in motion along the line ofpain-producing effects. This dual inference will cause in the life of the yogi adual discipline involving a set determination to practise non-attachment, and asteady discipline of the lower nature. This will bring about a mental activityof such a nature that old tendencies, longings and desires no longer [151]attract, and no activities are indulged in which can produce later karma, orresults.That which is past can only now be worked out, and that type of karma, bringingpain, sorrow and misery in its train must be allowed to follow out its course.Present karma, or that precipitation of effects which the ego plans to dispersein the present life-cycle must equally play its part in the emancipation of thesoul. It is, however, possible for the spiritual man so to govern the lower manthat the happenings of karma (or the effects as they work out into the physicalobjective world) may cause no pain or distress, as they will be seen and met bythe non-attached yogi. Nor will further pain-producing causes be allowed to beset in motion.17. The illusion that the Perceiver and that which is perceived are one and thesame, is the cause (of the pain-producing effects) which must be warded off.This sutra brings us right back to the great basic duality of manifestation, theunion of spirit and matter. It is their interplay which produces all theform-producing modifications or activities on the various planes and which isthe cause of the limitations which pure consciousness has imposed upon itself.In a small commentary such as this it is impossible to enter with any fullnessinto this subject. All that it is possible to do is to touch upon the subject asit affects man himself. It might be summed up as follows:—All pain and [152]sorrow is caused by the spiritual man identifying himself with his objectiveforms in the three worlds and with the realm of phenomena in which those formshave their activities. When he can detach himself from the kingdom of the sensesand know himself as the “one who is not that which is seen and touched andheard” then he can free himself from all form-limitations and stand apart as thedivine perceiver and actor. He will use forms as he desires in order to attaincertain specific ends but is not deluded into regarding them as himself.Students would do well to learn to hold the consciousness that in the threeworlds (which is all that concerns the aspirant at this stage) he is the highestfactor in the well-known triplicities:The Perceiver Perception That which is perceived, The Thinker Thought Thoughtforms, The Knower Knowledge The field of knowledge, The Seer Sight That which isseen, The Observer Observation That which is observed, The Spectator Vision TheSpectacle,and many others equally well known.The great objective of Raja Yoga is to free the thinker from the modificationsof the thinking principle so that he no longer merges himself in the great worldof thought illusions nor identifies himself with that which is purelyphenomenal. He stands free and detached and uses the world of the senses as thefield of his intelligent activities and no longer as the field of hisexperiments and experience-gaining endeavours. [153]It must be remembered that the means of perception are the six senses; i.e. ,hearing, touch, sight, taste, smell and the mind, and that these six must betranscended and known for what they are. The means of perception reveal thegreat maya or world of illusion which is composed of forms of every kind, builtof substance which must be studied as to its atomic and molecular constructionand as to the basic elements which give to that substance its specificdifferentiations and qualities. For purposes of study the student will do wellto remember that he must investigate the nature of the following factors in thepolar opposite to spirit which we call matter:1. Atoms,2. Molecular matter,3. The elements,4. The three gunas or qualities,5. The tattvas or force differentiations in their seven forms.Through an understanding of the nature and distinctions of matter he will cometo a comprehension of the world of form which has held his spirit a prisoner forso long. This Patanjali points out in the next sutra.18. That which is perceived has three qualities, sattva, rajas and tamas(rhythm, mobility and inertia); it consists of the elements and the senseorgans. The use of these produces experience and eventual liberation.This is one of the most important sutras in the book for in a few concise wordswe have summed [154] up for us the nature of substance, its constitution, itspurpose and reason. Much time might be given to a consideration of eachsentence, and the words, “the qualities,” “the elements,” “the senses,”“evolution” and “liberation” express the sum total of the factors concerned inthe growth of man. These five are that with which the human unit is the mostconcerned and cover his career from the moment when he first took incarnationand throughout the long cycle of lives until he passes through the various gatesof initiation out into the larger life of the cosmos.First inertia distinguishes him, and his forms are of so heavy and gross anature that many and violent contacts are needed before he becomes aware of hissurroundings and later intelligently appreciates them. The great elements ofearth, water, fire and air play their part in the building of his forms and areincorporated into his very being. His various sense organs slowly become active;first, the five senses and then when the second quality of rajas or activity isfirmly established, the sixth sense or the mind begins to develop also. Later hebegins to perceive in all around him in the phenomenal world, the same qualitiesand elements as in himself, and his knowledge rapidly grows. From that he passesto a distinction between himself as the Perceiver and that which he perceives ashis forms and their world of being. The sixth sense becomes increasinglydominant and is eventually controlled by the true man who passes then into thesattvic state where he is harmonised in himself and consequently [155] with allaround him. His manifestation is rhythmic and in tune with the great whole. Helooks on at the spectacle and sees to it that those forms through which he isactive in the world of phenomena are duly controlled and that all his activitiesare in harmony with the great plan.When this is so, he is part of the whole yet freed and liberated from thecontrol of the world of form, of the elements and of the senses. He uses them;they no longer use him.19. The divisions of the gunas (or qualities of matter) are fourfold; thespecific, the non-specific, the indicated and the untouchable.It is interesting to note here that the gunas or qualities (the sum total of theattributes or aspects of the substance of our solar system) are fourfold. Inthis septenary division we have an analogy to the septenates found throughoutour manifested universe. First we have the major three aspects ofthought-substance:1. Sattvic substance rhythm, equilibrium, harmony, 2. Rajasic substancemobility, activity, 3. Tamasic substance inertia, stability. These three aredivided into: 1. The specific manifested elements, form, 2. The unspecific thesenses, force reactions, the tanmatras, 3. The indicated primary substance...thetattvas, atomic matter, 4. The untouchable the great Existence who is the sumtotal of all these.[156] This sutra is intended to cover the technicalities of the form aspect ofmanifestation whether referring to the manifestation of a human atom or of asolar deity, and simply indicates the natural triplicity of substance, itsseptenary nature, and its various mutations. It expresses the nature of thataspect of divine life which is called Brahma by the Hindu, and the Holy Spiritby the Christian. This is the third aspect of the Trimurti or Trinity, theaspect of active intelligent matter, out of which the body of Vishnu or of thecosmic Christ is to be built in order that Shiva, the Father or the spirit mayhave a medium of revelation. It might therefore be of use if the nature of thefour divisions of the three gunas were indicated, after giving the synonyms forthese gunas.The three gunas:1. The qualities of matter,2. The aspects of thinking substance, or of the universal mind,3. The attributes of force-matter,4. The three potencies.These triplicities should be carefully studied as it is through them thatconsciousness in its various degrees becomes possible. We are here dealing withthe great illusion of forms with which the Real Man identifies himself to hissorrow and pain throughout the long cycle of manifestation and from which hemust eventually be liberated. [157] A still vaster thought is also involved: theimprisoning of the life of a solar Logos in the form of a solar system, itsevolutionary development through the medium of that form and the eventualperfection and release of that life from the form at the conclusion of a greatsolar cycle. The lesser cycle of man is involved in the greater and hisattainment and the nature of his liberation is only relative to the greaterwhole.1. The specific division of the gunas.This specific or particularised division of the gunas is divided into sixteenparts which deal primarily with man’s reaction to the tangible objective world.a. The five elements: ether, air, fire, water and earth. These are the directlyinvolved effects of the unspecific or subjective sound or word.b. The five sense organs: the ear, the skin, the eye, the tongue and thenostrils, those physical organs or channels through which identification withthe tangible world becomes possible.c. The five organs of action: voice, hands, feet, the excretory organs and theorgans of generation.d. The mind. This is the sixth sense, the organ which synthesises all the othersense organs and eventually will make their use a thing of the past.These sixteen means of perception and activity in the phenomenal world arechannels for the real thinking man; they demonstrate his active reality and arethe sum total of the physical facts relating to every incarnated son of God.Similarly [158] in their cosmic connotation, they are the sum total of the factsdemonstrating the reality of a cosmic incarnation. “The Word is made flesh” bothindividually and in a cosmic sense.2. The unspecific division of the gunas.These are six in number and concern that which lies back of the specific; theydeal with that which is subjective and intangible, and with the force displaywhich produces the specific forms.Technically these are called in the Hindu books the tanmatras. They have to dowith consciousness more than form and are the “special modifications of buddhior consciousness” (Ganganatha Jha). They are:1. The element of hearing, or that which produces the ear,—the rudiment ofhearing,2. The element of touch or that which produces the mechanism of touch, the skin,etc.,—the rudiment of touch,3. The element of sight, or that which produces the eye,4. The element of taste, or that which produces the mechanism of taste.5. The element of smell, or that which produces the mechanism of smell.Back of these five lies the sixth tanmatra or modification of the consciousnessprinciple, the “feeling of personality” as it has been called, the “I am I”consciousnes, the ahamkara principle. It is this which produces the sense ofpersonal reality and of one’s being a separated unit of consciousness. It is thebasis of the great “heresy of [159] separateness” and the cause of the real orspiritual man being lured into the great illusion. It is this which forces manfor long aeons to identify himself with the things of the senses and it is thistoo which eventually brings him to the position where he seeks liberation.3. The indicated.Back of the sixteen specialized divisions and back of the six unspecialized,lies that which is the cause of them all, which is called in the Hindu booksBuddhi, or pure reason, the intellect apart from the lower mind, sometimescalled the intuition, whose nature is love-wisdom. This is the Christ-life orprinciple, which in the process of taking incarnation or form, as we know it,manifests forth as the specific and the unspecific. It is as yet for themajority only “indicated.” We surmise it is there. The work of Raja Yoga is tobring forth into full knowledge this vague surmise so that theory becomes factand that which is latent and believed to exist may be recognized and known forwhat it is.4. The untouchable.Finally we come to the fourth division of the gunas or aspects, that “in whichwe live and move and have our being,” the untouchable or unknown God. This isthe great form of existence in which our little forms are found. This is the sumtotal of the thinking substance of which our little minds are part; this is thewhole manifestation of God through the medium of the cosmic Christ of which eachlittle Son of God is a [160] part. Of this untouchable and unknown the mind ofman cannot as yet conceive.20. The seer is pure knowledge (gnosis). Though pure, he looks upon thepresented idea through the medium of the mind.Reference has already been made to the excellent translation of this sutra asgiven by Johnston which runs as follows: “The seer is pure vision. Though pure,he looks out through the vesture of the mind.” Ganganatha Jha throws stillfurther light upon it in the words “The spectator is absolute sentience, andthough pure, still beholds intellected ideas.” The thought conveyed is that thetrue man, the spectator, perceiver or thinker is the sum total of allperception, be it through the avenues of the senses or of the lower mind; he isin himself knowledge, clear vision or true perception. All that exists in thethree worlds exists because of and for him; he is the cause of its being andwhen he no longer seeks it or endeavours to vision it, for him it exists not.This sutra is one of the key verses in the book, and gives the clue to theentire science of yoga. Certain thoughts lie hid in its formulation which coverthe whole ground of this science and students would do well to give muchattention to this. It has a mantric effect and if stated as an affirmation andused constantly by the aspirant will eventually demonstrate to him the truth ofthe statement that “as a man thinketh, so is he.”“I am pure knowledge. Though pure, I look [161] upon presented ideas through themedium of the mind.”We have here:1. The seer or the one who looks on and considers (from his divine standpoint)this world of effects, this great maya of illusion,2. The presented idea. The thought conveyed here is that every form which passesbefore the spectator in the great panorama of life in the three worlds is a“presented-idea,” and that these presented ideas are therefore embodied thoughtsof some kind and must be regarded as such. The task of the occultist is to workwith the force which lies back of every form and not so much with the form whichis but the effect of some cause. This method of endeavour can only be developedgradually. The spectator passes gradually from the forms and their truesignificance in his own immediate environment and in his own tiny world, throughthe various forms of the world process until the world of causes stands revealedto him, and the world of effects assumes a secondary position.He perceives first the forms in the three worlds. Gradually then he becomesaware of that which caused them and of the type of force which brought them intobeing. Later he discovers the idea which they embody and, tracing themprogressively onward or back to their originating source, he comes into touchwith the great lives which are the cause of manifestation. He thus passes out ofthe realm of objectivity, out of the mental, emotional and physical worlds intothe [162] realm of the soul or of the subjective cause of this triplemanifestation. This is the world of ideas and therefore of pure knowledge, purereason and divine mind. Later, at a very advanced stage he touches the one Lifewhich synthesises the many lives, the one Purpose which blends the many ideasinto one homogeneous plan.3. The mind. This is the instrument which the seer employs in order to perceivepresented ideas or thought forms. For purposes of clarification it might benoted that the presented ideas fall into five groups of thought forms:a. The tangible objective forms in the physical world of every day. With thesethe seer has for long identified himself in the earlier and more savage stagesof human existence.b. The moods, feelings and desires, which all have form in the astral world, theworld of the emotions.c. The thought forms in their myriad distinctions which crowd the mental world.Through these “presented ideas,” the seer achieves knowledge of the not-self.d. The thought forms which he can create himself after he has learned to controlhis instrument the mind and can discriminate between the illusory world ofpresent ideas and those realities which constitute the world of spirit.Through this process he arrives at a knowledge of himself. Throughout the greatexperience of knowing the not-self and knowing himself, he uses the mind as hismedium of search, of explanation and of interpretation, for the senses and [163]all his channels of contact, telegraph constant information and reactions to themind via the lower instrument of the brain. Having reached this stage the seeris then able to use the mind in a reverse manner. Instead of turning hisattention to the not-self or the illusory world of effects and instead ofstudying his own lower nature, he can now, owing to the mental control achieved,arrive at the fifth stage:e. The ideas presented by the world of spiritual life, the realm of spiritualknowledge, and the kingdom of God in the truest sense.Through this, the seer arrives at a knowledge of God as He is and comes to anunderstanding of the nature of spirit. The mind then serves a triple purpose:a. Through it, the seer looks out upon the realm of causes, the spiritual realm.b. By its means, the world of causes can be interpreted in terms of theintellect.c. By using it correctly, the seer can transmit to the physical brain of thelower personal self (the reflection in the world of effects of the true man)that which the soul sees and knows. This triangle is then formed and comes intoworking activity: The seer or spiritual man, the mind, his medium ofinvestigation, or the window through which he looks out (whether upon the worldof effects, upon himself, or upon the world of cause) and the brain, which isthe receiving plate upon which the seer can impress his “pure knowledge” usingthe mind as an interpreter and transmitting agency. [164]21. All that is exists for the sake of the soul.Man in his arrogance should not take this sutra to mean that all that is createdexists for him. The sense is much wider than this. The soul referred to is thatof the Supreme Being of which the soul of man is but an infinitesimal part.Man’s tiny world, his small environment and contacts, exist for the sake of theexperience they bring him and the final liberation they bring about; he is thecause of their manifestation and they are the result of his own thought power.But around him and through him is to be found that greater whole of which he isa part, and the entire vast universe, planetary and solar, exists for the sakeof the vaster Life in whose body he is but an atom. The whole world of forms isthe result of the thought activity of some life; the whole universe of matter isthe field for the experience of some existence.22. In the case of the man who has achieved yoga (or union) the objectiveuniverse has ceased to be. Yet it existeth still for those who are not yet free.This sutra holds the germ of the entire science of thought. Its premise is basedupon the realisation that all that we behold are modifications of thoughtsubstance, that the thinker creates his own world, whether he be God or man.When a man through the science of yoga (that science which deals with the“suppression of the activities [165] of the thinking principle” or with mindcontrol), has achieved full power over the mind and over mental substance orthought matter, he is freed from the control of those forms which hold themajority of men captive in the three worlds.He stands then apart from the great illusion; the bodies which have hithertoheld him no longer do so; the great currents of ideas and thoughts and desireswhich have their origin through the “modifications of the thinking principle” ofmen imprisoned in the three worlds no longer sway or affect him; and the myriadthought forms which are the result of these currents in the mental, astral andphysical worlds no longer shut him away from the realities or from the truesubjective world of causes, and of force emanations. He is no longer deceivedand can discriminate between the real and the unreal, between the true and thefalse, and between the life of the spirit and the world of phenomena. He becomessubject then to the currents of thought, and the world of ideas emanating fromgreat spiritual entities, from spiritual lives, and the great plan of theArchitect of the Universe can unroll itself before him. He is liberated and freeand subject only to the new conditions of the life of the man who has made thegreat at-one-ment. The laws of the three worlds are not superseded but aretranscended, for the greater always includes the lesser and though—for purposesof service—he may choose to limit himself to a seemingly three dimensional life,yet he goes forth into the world of higher dimensions at his pleasure, and [166]when needed for the extension of the kingdom of God.The object of this science of yoga is to reveal to man the mode of thisliberation and how he can free himself. Hence the trend of Patanjali’s teachingup to this point has been to indicate man’s place in the scheme, to put hisfinger upon the basic cause of man’s restlessness and urge towards activity ofone kind or another; to show the reason for the existence of the great world ofeffects and to tempt the aspirant to an investigation of the world of causes;and so to demonstrate the need for further unfoldment and the nature of thehindrances to that unfoldment that the man will be ready to say: If this is allso, what are the means whereby this union with the real and this dispersal ofthe great illusion may be brought about? This second book presents the eightgreat means of yoga, giving thus a clear and concise outline of the exact stepsto be followed for the needed regulation of the physical, psychic and mentallife.23. The association of the soul with the mind and thus with that which the mindperceives, produces an understanding of the nature of that which is perceivedand likewise of the Perceiver.In this sutra the attention of the student is drawn to the primary quality whichhe must develop, that of discrimination. Its meaning is therefore very clear.The pairs of opposites, spirit and matter, purusha and prakriti. are [167]brought into close association and that union must come to be recognised by thesoul, the perceiving consciousness. Through the process of this blending of thedualities, the soul, the thinker, comes to a comprehension of the nature whichis his very own, the spiritual nature, and the nature of the phenomenal worldwhich he perceives, contacts and uses. The organ of perception is the mind andthe five senses, and from the standpoint of the soul, they form one instrument.For a long period and through many incarnations the soul or thinker identifieshimself with this organ of perception and in the earlier stages with that alsowhich he perceives through its use. He regards the phenomenal body he uses, thephysical body, as himself, as witness the expression: “I am tired” or “I amhungry.” He identifies himself with his body of feeling or desire, and says “Iam cross,” or “I want money.” He identifies himself with the mental vehicle andregards himself as thinking thus and so. It is this identification which resultsin the theological differences, and the doctrinal and sectarian diversitieseverywhere to be found, and in this fifth root race and particularly in thisfifth subrace this identification reaches its apotheosis. It is the era of thepersonal self, not of the spiritual Self. This realisation of the lower natureis part of the great evolutionary process but must be followed by a realizationof the other polar opposite, the spiritual Self. This is brought about by thesoul beginning to practise discrimination, at first theoretically andintellectually (hence the great value [168] of the present era of criticism andpolemical discussion, as it forms part of the planetary discriminative process)and later experimentally. This discrimination leads eventually to three things:1. An understanding of the distinction between spirit and matter,2. A comprehension of the nature therefore of the soul which is the product ofthis union, and is the son, produced by the union of the father-spirit and ofthe mother-matter,3. A development whereby the soul begins to identify itself with the spiritualaspect and not with the phenomenal world of forms. This later stage is greatlyaided and hastened through the practice of Raja Yoga and hence the determinationof the Hierarchy to give this science to the critical discriminating West. Itshould be borne in mind that the soul passes through great stages in theunifying process and that the word yoga covers the evolutionary development ofthe human Monad.1. The union of the soul with the form and its identification with the matteraspect,2. The union of thinking man or the self-conscious reflection in the threeworlds with the spiritual man on its own plane,3. The union of the spiritual man or divine thinker with its Father in Heaven,the Monad or spirit aspect. Stage I covers the period from the first incarnationup to the treading of the Probationary Path. Stage II covers the period of theProbationary Path up to the third initiation [169] upon the Path ofDiscipleship. Stage III covers the final stages of the Path of Initiation.24. The cause of this association is ignorance or avidya. This has to beovercome.Ignorance of the real nature of the soul and an urge to find out its own natureand its powers is the cause of the soul’s identifying itself with the organs ofperception, and with that which they perceive or bring within the consciousnessof the soul. When through this ignorance and its consequences, the soul fails tofind what it is seeking, there comes the stage when the search takes on adifferent form and the soul itself searches for reality. It might be expressedthus.Identification with the phenomenal world and the use of the outgoing organs ofperception covers the period which the real man spends in what is called theHall of Ignorance. Satiety, restlessness and a search for the knowledge of theself or soul characterises the period spent in the Hall of Learning.Realization, expansion of consciousness and identification with the spiritualman cover the period spent in the Hall of Wisdom. The terms human life, mysticlife and occult life apply to these three stages.25. When ignorance is brought to an end through non-association with the thingsperceived, this is the great liberation.During the process of incarnation, the seer, the soul, is submerged in the greatmaya or illusion. He is imprisoned by his own thought forms and [170] thoughtcreations and in those of the three worlds also. He regards himself as part ofthe phenomenal world. When, through experience and discrimination, he candistinguish between himself and those forms, then the process of liberation canproceed and eventually culminate in the great renunciation which once and forall sets a man free from the three worlds.This process is a progressive one and cannot be effected all at once. It coverstwo stages:1. The stage of probation, or, as the Christian expresses it, the Path ofPurification,2. The stage of discipleship in two parts:a. Discipleship itself or the steadfast training and discipline administered tothe personal lower self by the soul, directed by his guru or master,b. Initiation, or the progressive expansions of consciousness through which thedisciple passes under the guidance of the master.Certain words describe this dual process:a. Aspiration,b. Discipline,c. Purification,d. The practice of the means of yoga or union,e. Initiation,f. Realisation,g. Union.26. The state of bondage is overcome through perfectly maintaineddiscrimination.A word here on discrimination will be of value as it is the first great methodof attaining liberation [171] or freedom from the three worlds. Based as it ison a realisation of the essential duality of nature, and regarding nature as aresult of the union of the two polarities of the Absolute All, spirit andmatter, discrimination is at first an attitude of mind and must be sedulouslycultivated. The premise of the duality is admitted as a logical basis forfurther work and the theory is tested out in an effort to prove the truth. Theaspirant then definitely assumes the attitude of higher polarity (that ofspirit, manifesting as the soul or inner ruler) and seeks in the affairs ofevery day to discriminate between the form and the life, between the soul andthe body, between the sum total of the lower manifestation (physical, astral andmental man) and the real self, the cause of the lower manifestation.He seeks in the affairs of every day to cultivate a consciousness of the realand a negation of the unreal and this he carries into all his relationships andinto all his affairs. He accustoms himself, through persistent unbrokenpractise, to distinguish between the self and the not-self, and to occupyhimself with the affairs of spirit and not with those of the great maya or worldof forms. This distinction is at first theoretical, then intellectual but laterassumes more reality and enters into the happenings of the emotional andphysical world. Finally the following of this method eventuates in the entranceof the aspirant into an entirely new dimension and his identification with alife and a world of being dissociated from the three worlds of human endeavour.[172]When this is so the new environment becomes familiar to him so that he knows notonly the form but the subjective Reality which produces or causes the existenceof the forms.Then he passes on to the cultivation of the next great quality which isdispassion or desirelessness. A man may be able to distinguish between the realand the true, between the substance and the Life which animates it and yetdesire or “go out” towards the form existence. This too must be overcome beforeperfect liberation, emancipation or freedom is attained. In one of the oldcommentaries in the archives of the Lodge of Masters, the following words arefound:“It suffices not to know the way nor to feel the force which serveth to extractthe life from out of the forms of maya. A moment of great portent must takeplace wherein the chela breaketh by one act and through a word of Power theillusory sutratma which bindeth him to form. Like the spider which gathereth upthe thread again within himself whereby he ventured forth into unknown realms,so the chela withdraweth himself from all the forms in the three realms of beingwhich have hitherto enticed.”The above merits close consideration and can be linked to the thought embodiedin the occult phrase: “Before a man can tread the Path, he must become that Pathhimself.”27. The knowledge (or illumination) achieved is sevenfold, and is attainedprogressively.The Hindu teaching holds that the states of mind-consciousness are seven innumber. The [173] sixth sense and its use bring about seven modes of thought,or—to put it more technically—there are seven major modifications of thethinking principle. These are:1. Desire for knowledge . It is this which drives forth the Prodigal Son, thesoul into the three worlds of illusion, or (to carry the metaphor further backstill) it is this which sends forth the Monad or Spirit into incarnation. Thisbasic desire is what causes all experience.2. Desire for freedom. The result of experience and of the investigations whichthe soul carries on in its manifold life-cycles is to cause a great longing fora different condition and a great desire for liberation and for freedom from thewheel of rebirth.3. Desire for happiness. This is a basic quality of all human beings, though itshows itself in many different ways. It is based upon an inherent faculty ofdiscrimination and upon a deep seated capacity to contrast the “Father’s” homeand the Prodigal’s present condition. It is this inherent capacity for “bliss”or happiness which produces that restlessness and urge to change which lies backof the evolutionary urge itself. It is the cause of activity and progress.Dissatisfaction with the present condition is based upon a dim memory of a timeof satisfaction and of bliss. This has to be regained before peace can be known.4. Desire to do one’s duty. The first three modifications of the thinkingprinciple eventually bring evolving humanity to the state where the [174] motivefor life comes to be simply the fulfillment of one’s dharma. The longing forknowledge, for freedom, and for happiness has brought the man to a state ofutter dissatisfaction. Nothing brings him any true joy or peace. He hasexhausted himself in the search for joy for himself. Now he begins to widen hishorizon and to search where (in the group and in his environment), what he seeksmay lie. He awakens to a sense of responsibility to others and begins to seekfor happiness in the fulfillment of his obligations to his dependents, hisfamily, friends and all whom he contacts. This new tendency is the beginning ofthe life of service which leads eventually to a full realization of thesignificance of group consciousness. H.P.B. has said that a sense ofresponsibility is the first indication of the awakening of the ego or the Christprinciple.5. Sorrow . The greater the refinement of the human vehicle, the greater theresponse of the nervous system to the pairs of opposites, pain and pleasure. Asa man progresses and rises on the ladder of evolution in the human family itbecomes apparent that his capacity to appreciate sorrow or joy is greatlyincreased. This becomes terribly true in the case of an aspirant and of adisciple. His sense of values becomes so acute and his physical vehicle sosensitized that he suffers more than the average man. This serves to drive himforward with increasing activity in his search. His response to outer contactsis ever more rapid and his capacity for pain, physical and emotional, becomesgreatly increased. [175] This is apparent in the fifth race and particularly inthe fifth subrace in the increasing frequency of suicide. The capacity of therace to suffer is due to the development and refinement of the physical vehicleand to the evolution of the body of feeling, the astral.6. Fear . As the mental body develops and the modifications of the thinkingprinciple become more rapid, fear and that which it produces begin todemonstrate. This is not the instinctual fear of animals and of the savageraces, which is based upon the response of the physical body to physical planeconditions, but the fears of the mind, based upon memory, imagination andanticipation, and the power to visualize. These are difficult to overcome andcan only be dominated by the ego or soul itself.7. Doubt . This is one of the most interesting of the modifications for itconcerns causes more than effects. The man who doubts can be described perhapsas doubting himself as an arbiter of his fate, his fellowmen as to their natureand reactions, God, or the first cause as witnessed by the controversies builtup around religion and its exponents, nature itself, which doubt urges him on toconstant scientific investigation and finally, the mind itself. When he beginsto question the capacity of the mind to explain, interpret and comprehend, hehas practically exhausted the sum total of his resources in the three worlds.The tendency of these seven states of mind, produced through the experience ofthe man upon the Wheel of Life is to bring him to the point [176] where he feelsthat physical plane living, sentiency and mental processes have nothing to giveand utterly fail to satisfy him. He reaches the stage which Paul refers to whenhe says “I count all things but loss that I may win Christ.”The seven stages of illumination have been described by a Hindu teacher asfollows:1. The stage wherein the chela realizes that he has run the whole gamut of lifeexperience in the three worlds and can say “I have known all that was to beknown. Nothing further remains to know.” His place on the ladder is revealed tohim. He knows what he has to do. This relates to the first modification of thethinking principle, desire for knowledge.2. The stage wherein he frees himself from every known limitation, and can say“I have freed myself from my fetters.” This stage is long but results in theattainment of freedom and relates to the second of the modifications dealt withabove.3. The stage wherein the consciousness shifts completely out of the lowerpersonality and becomes the true spiritual consciousness, centered in the realman, the ego or soul. This brings in the consciousness of the Christ naturewhich is love, peace and truth. He can say now “I have reached my goal. Nothingremains to attract me in the three worlds.” Desire for happiness is satisfied.The third modification is transcended.4. The stage wherein he can say with truth “I have fulfilled my dharma, andaccomplished my whole duty.” He has worked off karma, and [177] fulfilled thelaw. Thus he becomes a Master and a wielder of the law. This stage has relationto the fourth modification.5. The stage wherein complete control of the mind is achieved and the peer cansay “My mind is at rest.” Then and only then, when complete rest is known canthe true contemplation and samadhi of the highest kind be known. Sorrow, thefifth modification, is dispelled by the glory of the illumination received. Thepairs of opposites are no longer at war.6. The stage wherein the chela realises that matter or form have no longer anypower over him. He can then say “The gunas or qualities of matter in the threeworlds no longer attract me; they call forth no response from me.” Feartherefore is eliminated for there is nothing in the disciple which can attractto him evil, death or pain. Thus equally the sixth modification is overcome andrealisation of the true nature of divinity and utter bliss takes its place.7. Full self-realisation is the next and final stage. The initiate can now say,with full conscious knowledge, “I am that I am” and he knows himself as one withthe All-Self. Doubt no longer controls. The full light of day or completedillumination takes place and floods the whole being of the seer.These are the seven stages upon the Path, the seven stations of the cross as theChristian puts it, the seven great initiations and the seven ways to bliss. Nowthe “Path of the just shineth ever more and more until the perfect day.” [178]THE EIGHT MEANS OF YOGA DEFINED28. When the means to Yoga have been steadily practised and when impurity hasbeen overcome, enlightenment takes place leading up to full illumination.We now come to the practical part of the book, wherein instruction is given asto the method to pursue if full yoga, union, or at-one-ment is to be achieved.The work might be described as twofold:1. The practice of the right means whereby union is brought about,2. The discipline of the lower threefold man so that impurity in any of thethree bodies is eradicated.This steadfast application to the twofold work produces two correspondingresults, each dependent upon its cause:1. Discrimination becomes possible. The practice of the means, leads theaspirant to a scientific understanding of the distinction existing between theself and the not-self, between spirit and matter. This knowledge is no longertheoretical and that to which the man aspires, but is a fact in the experienceof the disciple and one upon which he bases all his subsequent activities.2. Discernment takes place. As the purificatory process is carried on, thesheaths or bodies which veil the reality become attenuated and no longer act asthick veils, hiding the soul, and the world wherein the soul normally moves. Theaspirant becomes aware of a part of himself, [179] hitherto hidden and unknown.He approaches the heart of the mystery of himself and draws closer to the “Angelof the Presence” which can only be truly seen at initiation. He discerns a newfactor and a new world and seeks to make them his own in conscious experienceupon the physical plane.It should be noted here that the two causes of revelation, the practice of theeight means to yoga and the purification of the life in the three worlds, dealwith the man from the standpoint of the three worlds and bring about (in theman’s physical brain) the power to discriminate between the real and the unrealand to discern the things of the spirit. They cause also certain changes ofconditions within the head, reorganize the vital airs and act directly upon thepineal gland and the pituitary body. When these four:1. Practise,2. Purification,3. Discrimination,4. Discernment,are part of the life of the physical plane man, then the spiritual man, the egoor thinker on his own plane attends to his part of the liberating process andthe final two stages are brought about from above downwards. This sixfoldprocess is the correspondence upon the Path of Discipleship, of theindividualizing process, wherein animal man, the lower quaternary (physical,etheric, astral and lower mental) received that twofold expression of spirit,atma-buddhi, spiritual will and spiritual love, which completed him and made him[180] truly man. The two stages of development which are brought about by theego within the purified and earnest aspirant, are:1. Enlightenment . The light in the head, which is at first but a spark, isfanned to a flame which illumines all things and is fed constantly from above.This is progressive (see previous sutra), and is dependent upon steadfastpractise, meditation and earnest service.2. Illumination. The gradually increasing downpour of fiery energy increasessteadily the “light in the head,” or the effulgence found in the brain in theneighborhood of the pineal gland. This is to the little system of the threefoldman in physical manifestation what the physical sun is to the solar system. Thislight becomes eventually a blaze of glory and the man becomes a “son of light”or a “sun of righteousness.” Such were the Buddha, the Christ, and all the greatOnes who have attained.29. The eight means of yoga are: the Commandments or Yama, the Rules or Nijama,posture or Asana, right control of life-force or Pranayama, abstraction orPratyahara, attention or Dharana, meditation or Dhyana, and contemplation orSamadhi.It will be noted that these means or practices are apparently simple, but itmust be carefully remembered that they do not refer to anything accomplished onone or other plane in some one body, but to the simultaneous activity andpractice of these methods in all three bodies at once, [181] so that the entirethreefold lower man practices the means as they refer to the physical, theastral, and the mental vehicles. This is often forgotten. Therefore, in thestudy of these various means to yoga or union, we must consider them as theyapply to the physical man, then to the emotional man and then to the mental man.The yogi, for instance, has to understand the significance of right breathing orof posture as they relate to the triple aligned and coordinated lower man,remembering that it is only as the lower man forms a coherent rhythmicinstrument that it becomes possible for the ego to enlighten and illuminate him.The practise of breathing exercises, for instance, has led the aspirantfrequently to concentrate upon the physical apparatus of breath to the exclusionof the analogous practice of rhythmic control of the emotional life.It may be of use here if (before we take up the consideration of the means, oneby one) we tabulated them carefully, giving their synonyms where possible:Means I.The Commandments. Yama. Self-control or forbearance. Restraint. Abstention fromwrong acts. These are five in number and relate to the relation of the disciple(or chela) to others and to the outside world.Means II.The Rules. Nijama. Right observances. These are likewise five in number and arefrequently [182] called the “religious observances” because they relate to theinterior life of the disciple and to that tie, the sutratma or link whichrelates him to God, or to his Father in Heaven. These two, the five Commandmentsand the five Rules are the Hindu correspondence to the ten Commandments of theBible and cover the daily life of the aspirant, as it affects those around him,and his own internal reactions.Means III.Posture . Asana. Right Poise. Correct attitude. Position. This third meansconcerns the physical attitude of the disciple when in meditation, his emotionalattitude towards his environment or his group, and his mental attitude towardsideas, thought currents and abstract concepts. Finally, the practice of thismeans coordinates and perfects the lower threefold man so that the three sheathscan form a perfect channel for the expression or manifestation of the life ofthe spirit.Means IV.Right control of the life-force. Pranayama. Suppression of the breath.Regulation of the breath. This refers to the control, regulation and suppressionof the vital airs, the breath and the forces or shaktis of the body. It leads inreality to the organization of the vital body or the etheric body so that thelife current or forces, emanating from the ego or spiritual man on his ownplane, [183] can be correctly transmitted to the physical man in objectivemanifestation.Means V.Abstraction . Pratyahara. Right withdrawal. Restraint. Withdrawal of the senses.Here we get back of the physical and the etheric bodies, to the emotional body,the seat of the desires, of sensory perception and of feeling. Here can be notedthe orderly method which is followed in the pursuit of yoga or union. Thephysical plane life, external and internal is attended to; the correct attitudeto life in its triple manifestation is cultivated. The etheric body is organizedand controlled and the astral body is re-oriented, for the desire nature issubdued and the real man withdraws himself gradually from all sense contacts.The next two means relate to the mental body and the final one to the real manor thinker.Means VI.Attention . Dharana. Concentration. Fixation of the mind. Here the instrument ofthe Thinker, the Real Man, is brought under this control. The sixth sense iscoordinated, understood, focussed and used.Means VII.Meditation . Dhyana. The capacity of the thinker to use the mind as desired andto transmit to the brain, higher thoughts, abstract ideas, and idealisticconcepts. This means concerns higher and lower mind. [184]Means VIII.Contemplation . Samadhi. This relates to the ego or real man and concerns therealm of the soul. The spiritual man contemplates, studies or meditates upon theworld of causes, upon the “things of God.” He then, utilizing his controlledinstrument, the mind (controlled through the practise of concentration andmeditation) transmits to the physical brain, via the sutratma or thread whichpasses down through the three sheaths to the brain, that which the soul knows,sees and understands. This produces full illumination.MEANS I. THE COMMANDMENTS30. Harmlessness, truth to all beings, abstention from theft, from incontinenceand from avarice, constitute yama or the five commandments.These five commandments are simple and clear and yet, if practised, would make aman perfect in his relationships to other men, to supermen and to the subhumanrealms. The very first command to be harmless is in reality a summation of theothers. These commandments are curiously complete and cover the triple nature;in studying all these means we shall note their relation to one or other part ofthe lower threefold manifestation of the ego.I. Physical Nature .1. Harmlessness. This covers a man’s physical acts as they relate to all formsof divine manifestation [185] and concerns specifically his force nature or theenergy which he expresses through his physical plane activities. He hurts noone, and injures nobody.2. Truth. This concerns primarily his use of speech and of the organs of sound,and relates to “truth in the inmost part” so that truth in externality becomespossible. This is a large subject, and deals with the formulation of a man’sbelief regarding God, people, things and forms through the medium of the tongueand voice. This is covered in the aphorism in Light on the Path. “Before thevoice can speak in the presence of the Master it must have lost the power towound.”3. Abstention from theft . The disciple is precise and accurate in all hisaffairs and appropriates nothing which is not rightly his. This is a largeconcept covering more than the fact of actual physical appropriation of others’possessions.II. Astral Nature.4. Abstention from incontinence. This is literally desirelessness and governsthe out-going tendencies to that which is not the self, which finds physicalplane expression in the relation between the sexes. It must be remembered here,however, that this expression is regarded by the occult student as only one formwhich the out-going impulses take, and a form which allies a man closely withthe animal kingdom. Any impulse which concerns the forms and the real man [186]and which tends to link him to a form and to the physical plane is regarded as aform of incontinence. There is physical plane incontinence and this should havebeen left behind by the disciple long ago. But there are also many tendenciestowards pleasure seeking with consequent satisfaction of the desire nature andthis, to the true aspirant, is likewise regarded as incontinence.III. Mental Nature.5. Abstention from avarice . This deals with the sin of covetousness which isliterally theft upon the mental plane. The sin of avarice may lead to any numberof physical plane sins and is very powerful. It concerns mental force and is ageneric term covering those potent longings which have their seat not only inthe emotional or kamic (desire) body, but in the mental body also. Thiscommandment to abstain from avarice is covered by St. Paul when he says “I havelearned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.” That state has to beattained before the mind can be so quieted that the things of the soul can findentrance.31. Yama (or the five commandments) constitutes the universal duty and isirrespective of race, place, time or emergency.This sutra makes clear the universality of certain requirements, and by a studyof these five commandments which form the basis of what the Buddhist calls“right conduct,” it will be seen [187] that they form the basis of all true lawand that their infringement constitutes lawlessness. The word translated duty orobligation, could well be expressed by that comprehensive term dharma in respectto others. Dharma means literally the proper working out of one’s obligations(or karma) in the place, surroundings and environment where fate has put one.Certain governing factors in conduct must be observed and no latitude ispermitted in these respects no matter what one’s nationality, no matter what thelocality in which one finds oneself, and no matter what age one may be or whatemergency may arise. These are the five immutable laws governing human conductand when they are followed by all the sons of men, the full significance of theterm “peace to all beings” will be comprehended.MEANS II. THE RULES32. Internal and external purification, contentment, fiery aspiration, spiritualreading and devotion to Ishvara constitutes nijama (or the five rules).As said above, these five rules govern the life of the lower personal self andform the basis of character. The yoga practices which so much interest thewestern thinker and aspirant, and which lure him on with their apparent ease ofaccomplishment and richness of reward (such as psychic unfoldment) are notpermitted by the true guru or teacher until yama or nijama have [188] beenestablished as controlling factors in the daily life of the disciple. Thecommandments and the rules must first be kept, and when his outer conduct to hisfellowmen and his inner discipline of life is brought into line with theserequirements, then he can safely proceed with the forms and rituals of practicalyoga, but not till then.It is the failure to recognize this that leads to so much of the trouble amongstudents of yoga in the west. There is no better basis for the work of Easternoccultism than strict adherence to the requirements laid down by the Master ofall the Masters in the Sermon on the Mount , and the self-disciplined Christian,pledged to purity of life and unselfish service, can take up the practise ofyoga much more safely than his more worldly and selfish yet intellectualbrother. He will not run the risks that his unprepared brother takes.The words “internal and external purity” relate to the three sheaths in whichthe self is veiled and must be interpreted in a dual sense. Every sheath has itsdensest and most tangible form and this must be kept clean, for there is a sensein which the astral and mental bodies can be kept cleansed from impuritiescoming to them from their environment, just as the physical body must be keptcleansed from similar impurities. The subtler matters of those bodies must bekept equally cleansed and this is the basis of that study of magnetic puritywhich is the cause of so many observances in the East which seem inexplicable tothe Westerner. A shadow cast upon food by [189] a foreigner produces impureconditions; this is based upon the belief that certain types of force emanationsproduce impure conditions and though the method of counteracting theseconditions may savour of dead letter ritual yet the thought back of theobservance remains still the truth. So little is as yet known about forceemanations from the human being, or acting upon the human mechanism, that whatmay be called “scientific purification” is as yet in its infancy.Contentment is productive of conditions wherein the mind is at rest; it is basedupon the recognition of the laws governing life and primarily the law of karma.It produces a state of mind wherein all conditions are regarded as correct andjust, and as those in which the aspirant can best work out his problem andachieve the goal for any specific life. This does not entail a settling down andan acquiescence producing inertia, but a recognition of present assets, anavailing oneself of one’s opportunities and letting them form a background and abasis for all future progress. When this is done rightly the three remainingrules can be more easily kept.Fiery aspiration will be dealt with more fully in the next book, but it is wellto point out here that this quality of “going forth” towards the ideal or ofstraining towards the objective must be so profound in the aspirant to yoga thatno difficulties can turn him back. Only when this quality has been developed andproved and when it is found that no problem, no darkness and no [190] timeelement can hinder, is a man permitted to become the disciple of some Master.Fiery effort, steady persistent longing and enduring faithfulness to the idealvisioned are the sine qua non of discipleship. These characteristics must befound in all three bodies, leading to the constant disciplining of the physicalvehicle, the steady orientation of the emotional nature and the mental attitudewhich enables a man to “count all things but loss” if he can only arrive at hisgoal.Spiritual reading will be found to concern the development of the sense ofsubjective realities. It is fostered by study as understood in the physicalsense, and by the endeavour to arrive at the thoughts which words convey. It isdeveloped by a close scrutiny of the causes which lie back of all desires,aspirations and feelings, and thus is related to the desire or astral plane. Itdeals with the reading of symbols or geometrical forms ensouling an idea orthought and this concerns the mental plane. This will be dealt with later inBook III.Devotion to Ishvara may be briefly stated to constitute the attitude of thelower threefold self to the service of the ego, the inner ruler, the God orChrist within. This will be triple in its manifestation, bringing that lowerpersonal self into a life of obedience to the Master within the heart;eventually bringing the aspirant into the group of some adept or spiritualteacher, and leading him also into devoted service to Ishvara or the divine Selfas found in the hearts of all men and back of all forms of divine manifestation.[191]33. When thoughts which are contrary to yoga are present there should be thecultivation of their opposite.The translation by Johnston gives the same idea in very beautiful words and themethod is adequately brought out. He says:“When transgressions hinder, the weight of the imagination should be thrown uponthe opposite side.”The entire science of the balancing of the pairs of opposites is given in thesetwo translations, neither one being fully complete without the other. It isoften difficult to translate the ancient Sanskrit terms by one word or phrase,for in that language a term will stand for an entire idea and will requireseveral phrases in order to convey the true meaning in the more limited Englishtongue.Certain basic concepts are embodied in this sutra and for the sake of claritymight be tabulated as follows:1. As a man thinketh so is he. That which works out into physical objectivity isalways a thought, and according to that thought or idea so will be the form andlife-purpose.2. Thoughts are of two kinds; those tending to form-building, to limitation, tophysical plane expression; those tending away from the lower three planes andtherefore from the form aspect as we know it in the three worlds, and leading tounion (yoga or at-one-ment) with the soul, the Christ aspect. [192]3. When it is found that the thoughts habitually cultivated are productive ofastral and physical reactions and results it must be realized that they areinimical to yoga; they hinder the at-one-ing process.4. Contrary thoughts to these must then be cultivated; these can be easilyascertained for they will be the direct opposite of the inhibiting thoughts.5. The cultivation of the thoughts which will tend to yoga and lead a man to aknowledge of his real self and consequent union with that self involves a tripleprocess:a. The new thought concept, definitely formulated and found to be contrary tothe old thought current, must be ascertained and considered.b. The use of the imagination comes next in order to bring the thought intomanifestation. This brings in the realm of desire and consequently the astral oremotional body is affected.c. Then follows definite visualization of the effect of that which has beenthought and imagined, as it will manifest in the physical plane life.This will be found to generate energy. This means consequently that the ethericbody becomes vitalized or energized by the new thought current and certaintransformations and re-organizations take place which eventually cause acomplete change in the activities of the physical plane man. The constantcultivation of this effects an entire transformation in the threefold lower man,and eventually the truth of the Christian phraseology [193] becomes apparent,“only Christ is seen and heard,” only the real or spiritual man can be seenexpressing himself through a physical medium, as Christ did through Hisinstrument and disciple, Jesus.34. Thoughts contrary to yoga are harmfulness, falsehood, theft, incontinence,and avarice, whether committed personally, caused to be committed or approvedof, whether arising from avarice, anger or delusion (ignorance); whether slightin the doing, middling or great. These result always in excessive pain andignorance. For this reason, the contrary thoughts must be cultivated.It will be noted that the five Commandments deal specifically with those“thoughts contrary to yoga” or union, and that the keeping of the Commandmentswill bring about:a. Harmlessness instead of harmfulness,b. Truth instead of falsehood,c. Abstention from theft instead of stealing,d. Self-control instead of incontinence,e. Contentment instead of avarice or covetousness.No excuse is left to the aspirant, and the truth is borne in on him thattransgression of the Commandments is equally productive of results whether theviolation is trifling or very great. A “contrary thought” must produce itseffect and the effect is dual; pain, and ignorance or delusion. There are threewords which the occult student associates ever with the three worlds: [194]1. Maya or illusion , having reference to the world of forms in which the trueself finds itself when in incarnation, and with which it ignorantly identifiesitself for long aeons;2. Delusion , the process of wrong identification, in which the self deludesitself, and says “I am the form;”3. Ignorance or avidya, the result of this wrong identification and at the sametime the cause of it.The self is clothed in form; it is deluded in the world of illusion. Every time,however, that “thoughts contrary to yoga” are knowingly entertained, the selfsubmerges itself still more in the illusory world and adds to the veil ofignorance. Every time that the “weight of the imagination” is thrown on the sideof the real nature of the self and turned away from the world of the not-self,the illusion is lessened, the delusion becomes weakened, and ignorance isgradually superseded by knowledge.35. In the presence of him who has perfected harmlessness, all enmity ceases.This sutra demonstrates to us the working out of a great law. In Book IV. Sutra17, Patanjali tells us that the perception of a characteristic, of a quality andof an objective form is dependent upon the fact that in the perceiver similarcharacteristics, qualities and objective capacity are to be found. Thissimilarity is the basis of perception. The same truth is hinted at in the first[195] Epistle of St. John where the words are found “We shall be like Him for weshall see Him as He is.” Only that can be contacted which is already present orpartially present in the perceiver’s consciousness. If enmity and hatred aretherefore to be found by the perceiver, it is because in him the seeds of enmityand hatred are present. When they are absent naught but unity and harmonyexists. This is the first stage of universal love, the practical endeavour onthe part of the aspirant to be at one with all beings. He begins with himselfand sees to it that the seeds of harmfulness in his own nature are eradicated.He deals, therefore, with the cause which produces enmity towards him andothers. The natural result is that he is at peace and others are at peace withhim. In his presence even wild beasts are rendered impotent and this by thecondition of the mind-state of the aspirant or yogin.36. When truth to all beings is perfected, the effectiveness of his words andacts is immediately to be seen.This question of truth is one of the great problems which the aspirant has tosolve, and he who attempts to speak only that which is entirely accurate willfind himself confronted by very definite difficulties. Truth is entirelyrelative whilst evolution proceeds, and is progressive in its manifestation. Itmight be defined as the demonstration on the physical plane of as much of thedivine reality as the stage in evolution and the medium [196] employed permit.Truth, therefore, involves the ability of the perceiver or aspirant to seecorrectly the amount of the divine which a form (tangible, objective, or ofwords) clothes. It involves, therefore, the capacity to penetrate to the subjectand to contact that which every form veils. It involves also the ability of theaspirant to construct a form (tangible, objective, or of words) which willconvey the truth as it is. This is in reality the first two stages of the greatcreative process:1. Correct perception,2. Accurate construction,and it leads on to the consummation dealt with in the sutra underconsideration—the effectiveness of all words and acts to convey reality or truthas it is. This sutra gives the clue to the work of the magician and is the basisfor the great science of mantras or of words of power which are the equipment ofevery adept.Through an understanding of,a. The law of vibration,b. The science of sound,c. The purpose of evolution,d. The present cyclic stage,e. The nature of form,f. The manipulation of atomic substance,the adept not only sees truth in all things but comprehends how to make truthvisible, thus aiding the evolutionary process and “casting images upon thescreen of time.” This he does through certain words and acts. For the aspirant,the development of this capacity comes through a constant [197] effort tofulfill the following requirements:1. Strict attention to every formulation of words used,2. The wise use of silence as a factor of service,3. The constant study of the causes lying back of every act so that the reasonfor the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of action is understood.4. A steady endeavour to see the reality in every form. This literally involvesa study of the law of cause and effect, or karma, the object of the karmic lawbeing to bring the opposite pole of Spirit, matter, into strict conformity withthe requirements of spirit so that matter and form can perfectly express thenature of spirit.37. When abstention from theft is perfected, the yogi can have whatever hedesires.In this is to be found the clue to the great law of supply and demand. When theaspirant has learned to “desire nothing for the separated self” he can then betrusted with the riches of the universe; when he makes no demand for the lowernature and claims nothing for the threefold physical man, then all that hedesires comes to him unasked and unclaimed. In some translations the words arefound “all jewels are his.”It must be remembered with care that the theft referred to has reference notonly to the taking of things tangible and physical, but has reference also toabstention from theft on the emotional or mental planes. The aspirant takesnothing; [198] emotional benefits, such as love and favor, dislike or hatred arenot claimed by him and absorbed when they do not belong to him; intellectualbenefits, the claiming of a reputation not warranted, the assumption of some oneelse’s duty, favour or popularity are all equally repudiated by him and headheres with strictness to that which is his own. “Let every man attend to hisown dharma” and fulfill his own role, is the Eastern injunction. “Mind your ownbusiness” is the Western attempt to teach the same truth and convey theinjunction that we each of us must not steal from another the opportunity to doright, to measure up to responsibility and to do his duty. This is the trueabstention from theft. It will lead a man perfectly to meet his own obligations,to shoulder his own responsibility and to fulfill his own duty. It will lead himto refrain from appropriating anything that belongs to his brother in the threeworlds of human endeavour.38. By abstention from incontinence, energy is acquired.Incontinence is usually regarded as the dissipation of the vitality or thevirility of the animal nature. The power to create upon the physical plane andto perpetuate the race is the highest physical act of which man is capable. Thedissipation of the vital powers through loose living and incontinence is thegreat sin against the physical body. It involves the failure to recognize theimportance of the procreative act, the inability to [199] resist the lowerdesires and pleasures, and a loss of self control. The results of this failureare apparent throughout the human family at this time in the low health average,in the full hospitals, and the diseased, enfeebled and anemic men, women andchildren everywhere to be found. There is little conservation of energy, and thevery words “dissipation” and dissipated men” carry a lesson.The first thing a disciple has to do is to learn the true nature of creation andto conserve his energy. Celibacy is not enjoined. Self-control is. In therelatively short cycle of lives, however, in which the aspirant fits himself totread the path, he may have to pass a life or maybe several in a definiteabstention from the act of procreation in order to learn complete control and todemonstrate the fact that he has completely subdued the lower sex nature. Theright use of the sex principle along with entire conformity to the law of theland is characteristic of every true aspirant.Apart from a consideration of this subject along the lines of the conservationof energy, there is another angle from which the aspirant approaches the problemand that is the transmutation of the vital principle (as manifested through thephysical organism) into the dynamic demonstration of it as manifested throughthe organ of sound, or creation, through the word, the work of the truemagician. There is as all students of occultism know, a close connection betweenthe organs of generation and the [200] third major centre, the throat centre.This is apparent physiologically in the change of voice seen during theadolescent period. Through the true conservation of energy and abstention fromincontinence, the yogi becomes a creator on the mental plane through the use ofthe word and of sounds, and the energy which can be dissipated through theactivity of the lower centre is concentrated and transmuted into the greatcreative work of the magician. This is done through continence, pure living andclean thinking, and not through any perversions of occult truth such as sexmagic and the enormities of the sex perversions of various so-called occultschools. The latter are on the black path and do not lead to the portal ofinitiation.39. When abstention from avarice is perfected, there comes an understanding ofthe law of rebirth.This sutra gives in unequivocal terms the great teaching that it is desire forform of some kind which brings the spirit into incarnation. When desirelessnessis present, then the three worlds can no longer hold the yogi. We forge our ownchains in the furnace of desire and of a various longing for things, forexperience and for form life.When contentment is cultivated and present, gradually these chains drop off andno others are forged. As we disentangle ourselves from the world of illusion,our vision becomes cleared, and [201] the laws of being and of existence becomeapparent to us and are little by little understood. The how and the why of lifeare answered. The reason for and the method of physical plane existence is nolonger a problem, and the yogi understands why the past has been and what itscharacteristics are; he understands the reason for the present life cycle andexperience and can make practical application of the law each day, and he knowswell what he has to do for the future. Thus he frees himself, desires nothing inthe three worlds and re-orients himself to the conditions in the world ofspiritual being.In these qualities we have the carrying out of the five Commandments.40. Internal and external purification produces aversion for form, both one’sown and all forms.This paraphrase of Sutra 40 does not adhere to the technical translation of theSanskrit words on account of the misunderstanding of the words used. Literallythe translation runs “internal and external purification produces hatred forone’s own body and non-intercourse with all bodies.” The tendency of students inthe West to interpret literally necessitates a somewhat freer translation. TheEastern student, more versed in the symbolic presentation of truth is not soliable to make mistakes along this line. In considering this sutra it should beremembered that purity is a quality of spirit. [202]Purification is necessarily of various kinds and relates to the four vehicles(the physical body, the etheric body, the emotional body and the mental body)through which man contacts the three worlds of his endeavor. We might,therefore, distinguish between them as follows:a. External purity physical vehicle dense body, b. Magnetic purity ethericvehicle internal purity, c. Psychic purity astral vehicle emotional purity, d.Mental purity mental vehicle purity of the concrete mindIt should be most carefully borne in mind that this purity concerns thesubstance out of which each of these vehicles is composed. It is attained inthree ways:1. Elimination of impure substance or of those atoms and molecules which limitthe free expression of spirit, and which confine it to the form so that it canhave neither free ingress nor egress;2. Assimilation of those atoms and molecules which will tend to provide a formthrough which spirit can adequately function;3. The protection of the purified form from contamination and deterioration.On the Path of Purification or of Probation, this eliminative process iscommenced; on the Path of Discipleship, the rules for the constructive orassimilative process are learnt and on the Path of Initiation (after the secondinitiation,) the protective work is begun.In the occident the rules of external purification, of sanitation and of hygieneare well known and largely practised. In the orient, the rules [203] of magneticpurification are better known and when the two systems are synthesized andmutually recognized, the physical sheath in its dual nature will eventually bebrought to a high degree of refinement.In this cycle, however, the interest of the Hierarchy is being largely centredon the question of psychic purity and this is the reason for the trend of theoccult teaching at present developing. It is away from what is commonlyunderstood by psychic development, lays no emphasis on the lower psychic powersand seeks to train the aspirant in the laws of the spiritual life. This producesa realization of the nature of the psyche or soul, and a control of the lowerpsychic nature. The great “push” of the hierarchical endeavour for this century,1926-2026, will be along these lines, combined with a dissemination of the lawsof thought. Hence the necessity for the promulgation of the teaching given inthe Yoga Sutras. They give the rules for mind control but the nature of thepsychic powers and the development of the psychic consciousness are also largelydealt with.The entire third book deals with these powers and the theme of the sutras as awhole might be briefly stated to be the development of mind control with a viewto soul-contact and the consequent control of the lower psychic powers, theirunfoldment paralleling that of the higher powers. This should be emphasized.Aversion for form or “desirelessness,” which is the generic term covering thiscondition of mind, is the great impulse [204] which eventually leads to completeliberation from form.It is not that form or form taking is in itself evil. Both forms and the processof incarnation are right and proper in their place but for the man who has nofurther use for experience in the three worlds, having learnt the needed lessonsin the school of life, form and rebirth become evil and must be relegated to aposition outside the life of the ego. That the liberated man may choose to limithimself by a form for specific purposes of service is true, but this he doesthrough an act of the will and self-abnegation; he is not impelled thereto bydesire but by love of humanity and a longing to stay with his brothers till thelast of the sons of God has reached the portal of liberation.41. Through purification comes also a quiet spirit, concentration, conquest ofthe organs, and ability to see the Self.It should be remembered that both the Commandments and the Rules (Yama andNyama) have to do with the lower fourfold self, functioning in the three worlds,and frequently called the lower quaternary. We have seen in the preceding sutrathat the purification required is fourfold and concerns four vehicles. Theresults of this purity are also fourfold and have reference equally to the foursheaths. These results are, in the order of the vehicles: [205]1. Conquest of the organs The physical body, 2. A quiet spirit The emotionalvehicle, 3. Concentration The lower mind or the mental body, 4. Ability to seethe self The synthetic result of the triple condition of the above sheaths.The “conquest of the organs” has reference specially to the senses and is theresult of magnetic purity or the refinement of the etheric body. In thisconnection students should bear in mind that the physical body is not aprinciple, but is built in exact conformity with the etheric body. This ethericbody is the magnetic vehicle on the physical plane and attracts (according toits own nature and constituents) those atoms and particles of substance out ofwhich the dense physical is constructed. When the sense perceptions are refinedand when the vibratory condition of the vital body is justly attuned, the organsof the senses are entirely dominated and controlled by the real man and put himin contact eventually with the two highest subplanes of the physical plane andnot with the lower astral as is now the case. The correct order of this controlof the organs of physical perception or of the five senses is as follows:1. Correct intellectual perception of the ideal on the mental plane.2. Pure desire, freed from love of form on the emotional or astral plane,3. Correct use and development of the five centres [206] up the spine (base ofspine, sacral centre, solar plexus, heart and throat centres), each of which isfound in the etheric body and is allied with one or other of the five senses,4. Consequent correct reaction of the sense organs to the requirements of thetrue or spiritual man.In connection with the astral body, the result of purification is a quietspirit, or the “gentle stillness” of the vehicle so that it can adequatelyreflect the Christ principle, or the buddhic nature. The relation of the astralor kamic principle (using the middle vehicle of the threefold lower man) to thebuddhic principle using the middle vehicle of the spiritual triad (oratma-buddhi-manas), should be carefully considered. Quieted emotions, and thecontrol of the desire nature ever precede the re-orientation of the lower.Before the desire of a man can be towards things spiritual he has to cease todesire the things of the world, and of the flesh. This produces an interlude ofgreat difficulty in the life of neophyte, and the process is symbolized for usin the use of the word “conversion” in orthodox Christian circles; it involves“a turning round” with its consequent temporary turmoil, but eventual quietness.In the mental body, the effect of purification is the development of thecapacity to concentrate or to be one-pointed. The mind no longer flits hitherand thither but becomes controlled and quiescent and receptive to the higherimpress. [207] As this is discussed fully in book three we need not deal furtherwith it here.When these three results of purification are making themselves felt in the lifeof the aspirant, he nears a certain climax which is a sudden perception of thenature of the soul. He gets a vision of the reality which is himself, and findsout the truth of the words of the Christ that “the pure in heart shall see God.”He beholds the soul and henceforth his desire is for ever towards reality andaway from the unreal and the world of illusion.42. As a result of contentment bliss is achieved.There is little to say in connection with this sutra except to point out thatall pain, displeasure and unhappiness are based upon rebellion, and that, fromthe point of view of the occultist, rebellion but stirs up increased trouble,and resistance only serves to feed the evil, whatever it may be. The man who haslearnt to accept his lot, wastes no time in vain regrets, and his entire energycan then be given to the perfect fulfillment of his dharma, or obligatory work.Instead of repining, and clouding the issues of life with worry, doubt anddespair, he clarifies his path by the quiet realization of life as it is and adirect appreciation of what he may make of it. Thus no strength, time oropportunity is lost, and steady progress towards the goal is made. [208]43. Through fiery aspiration and through the removal of all impurity, comes theperfecting of the bodily powers and of the senses.Though the two causes of the perfecting process are aspiration and purification,yet these two form really only one and are the two aspects of the discipline ofthe Probationary Path. The old commentary which forms the esoteric basis of theinner teaching on Raja Yoga has some sentences which will be found of value herein conveying the correct concept:“As the breath of fire streams upward through the system, as the fiery elementmakes its presence felt, that which is hindering is seen to disappear, and thatwhich was obscure becomes illuminated.The fire ascends and barriers are burned; the breath expands, and limitationsdisappear. The seven, hitherto quiescent, stir to life. The ten portals, sealedand closed or partially ajar, swing wide.The five great means of contact rush into activity. Obstacles are overcome, andbarriers no longer hinder. The purified one becomes the great receiver and theOne is known.”In these words the purification by fire and by air is dealt with and this is thepurification undergone on the path of yoga. Purification by water has beensubmitted to in the later stages of the life of the highly evolved man, prior totreading the Path of Discipleship, and is hinted at in the words “waters ofsorrow” so often used. Now the fiery ordeal is undergone and the entire lowernature is passed through the fire. This is the first meaning and the one withwhich the aspirant [209] is most concerned. It is called forth when he can, fromhis heart, send forth the call for fire, embodied in the words:“I seek the Way; I yearn to know. Visions I see, and fleeting deep impressions.Behind the Portal, on the other side, lies that which I call home, for thecircle hath been well-nigh trod, and the end approacheth the beginning.I seek the Way. All ways my feet have trod. The Way of Fire calls me with fierceappeal. Naught in me seeks the way of peace; naught in me yearns for earth.Let the fire rage, the flames devour; let all the dross be burnt; and let meenter through that Gate, and tread the Way of Fire.”The breath of God is felt as the cleansing breeze also and is the response ofthe soul to the aspiration of the disciple. The soul then “inspires” the lowerman.The secondary meaning has of course direct reference to the work of thekundalini or serpent fire at the base of the spine as it responds to the soulvibration (felt in the head, in the region of the pineal gland, and called “thelight in the head”). Mounting upward, it burns out all obstructions in thespinal etheric channel and vitalizes or electrifies the five centres up thespine and the two in the head. The vital airs within the ventricles of the headare also swept into activity and produce a cleansing, or rather eliminatingeffect therein. With this the student has as yet nothing to do, beyond seeing toit that as far as in him lies, the aspiration of his heart is of the needed“fiery” character, and that the steady purification of his physical, emotionaland mental [210] nature, proceeds as desired. When this is the case, theresponse of the soul will be effective and the consequent reactions within theetheric centres will take place safely, under law, and normally.The three verses quoted above deal with,a. The seven centres, hitherto quiescent,b. The ten closed portals, the ten orifices of the physical body,c. The five senses, through which contact with the physical plane takes place, and in these terms the entire outgoing and ingoing activities of the physicalplane man are comprehended.When these have all been brought under the direction of the soul, or innerruler, then unity with the soul is effected, and consequently identificationwith that one in whom we live and move and have our being.44. Spiritual reading results in a contact with the Soul (or divine One).This might perhaps more literally be translated as “the reading of symbolsproduces contact with the soul.” A symbol is a form of some kind which veils orhides a thought, an idea or a truth and it might be laid down therefore as ageneral axiom that every form of every kind is a symbol, or the objective veilof a thought. This when applied, will be found to refer equally to a human form,which is intended to be the symbol (or made in the image) of God; it is anobjective [211] form veiling a divine thought, idea or truth, the tangiblemanifestation of a divine concept. The goal of evolution is to bring toperfection, this objective symbolic form. When a man knows that, he ceases toidentify himself with the symbol which is his lower nature. He begins tofunction consciously as the divine inner subjective self, using the lower man toveil and hide his form, and daily dealing with that form so that it is mouldedand wrought into an adequate instrument of expression. The idea is also carriedforward into the daily life, in the attitude of the man to every form (in thethree kingdoms of nature) he contacts. He seeks to see below the surface and totouch the divine idea.This is the fourth of the Rules and concerns the man’s inner attitude to theobjective universe. It might be said therefore that the rules concern a man’sattitude towards:1. His own lower nature internal and external purification, 2. His karma or lotin life contentment, 3. His soul or ego fiery aspiration, 4. Environment andphysical plane contacts spiritual reading. 5. The one Existence, God devotion toIshvara.Thus a “right attitude” to all things covers this set of rules.45. Through devotion to Ishvara the goal of meditation (or samadhi) is reached.The goal of meditation is ability to contact the divine inner self, and throughthe contact, to come [212] to a realization of the unity of that self with allselves and the All-Self, and this, not just theoretically, but as a fact innature. This comes about when a state called “samadhi” is achieved wherein theconsciousness of the thinker is transferred out of the lower brain consciousnessinto that of the spiritual man or soul on its own plane. The stages of thistransfer might be stated to be as follows:1. Transfer of the consciousness of the body, the outgoing instinctualconsciousness of the physical man, into the head. This necessitates a consciouswithdrawal of the consciousness to a point within the brain in the neighborhoodof the pineal gland, and its conscious definite centering there.2. Transfer of the consciousness out of the head or brain into the mind ormental body. In this transfer, the brain remains keenly alert and the withdrawalis consciously undertaken via the etheric body, using the brahmarandra oropening at the top of the head. At no point is the man in trance, unconscious orasleep. He actively undertakes and carries forward this abstracting orwithdrawing process.3. Transfer of the consciousness from out of the mental body into that of theego, the soul, lodged in the causal body or egoic lotus. There is then broughtabout a condition in which the brain, the mental body and the egoic body form acoherent quiescent unit, alive, alert, positive and steady.4. The state of samadhi or spiritual contemplation [213] can then be entered,when the soul looks out upon its own world, sees the vision of things as theyare, contacts reality and “knows God.”Following upon this comes the stage in which the spiritual man transmits to thebrain via the mind that which is visioned, seen, contacted and known; and inthis way, the knowledge becomes part of the brain contents and is available foruse upon the physical plane.This is the goal of the meditation process, and the results in their manydistinctions are the subject of Book III. and are produced by conformity to theeight means of yoga dealt with in Book II. Only devotion to Ishvara or true loveof God, with its accompanying qualities of service, love of man, and patientendurance in well-doing, will carry a man along this arduous path of discipline,purification and hard work.MEANS III. POSTURE46. The posture assumed must be steady and easy.This sutra is one that has led our occidental students into a great deal oftrouble for they have interpreted it in an entirely physical sense. That it hasa physical meaning is true but taken in reference to the lower threefold natureit might be said that it refers to a steady immovable position of the physicalbody when in meditation, a firm steadfast unwavering condition of the astral oremotional body in the passage through worldly existence, and an unfluctuatingsteady mind, one [214] that is absolutely under control. Of these three, itmight be said that the physical posture is of the least importance, and that theposition in which the aspirant can the soonest forget that he possesses aphysical body is the best. It might be generally laid down that an uprightposition in a comfortable chair, with the spine erect, the feet crossednaturally, the hands folded in the lap, the eye closed, and the chin a littledropped is the best posture for the occidental aspirant. In the East there is ascience of postures and about eighty-four different positions, some of them mostintricate and painful, are listed. This science is a branch of hatha yoga and isnot to be followed by the fifth root-race; it is a remnant of that yoga whichwas necessary and sufficient for the Lemurian root-race man, who needed to learnphysical control. Bhakti yoga, or the yoga of the devotee was the yoga of theAtlantean or fourth root-race man, plus a little hatha yoga. In this fifthrootrace, the Aryan, hatha yoga should fall into desuetude altogether where thedisciple is concerned, and he should occupy himself with Raja Yoga plus bhaktiyoga—he should be a mental devotee.The Lemurian disciple learned to control the physical body and to devote it tothe service of Ishvara through hatha yoga, with aspiration towards emotionalcontrol.The Atlantean disciple learned to control the emotional body and to devote it tothe service of Ishvara through bhakti yoga, with aspiration towards mentalcontrol. [215]The Aryan disciple has to learn to control the mental body and devote it to theservice of Ishvara through Raja Yoga, with aspiration towards knowledge of theindweller, the soul. Thus in this root-race, the entire lower man, thepersonality is subjugated and the “Transfiguration” of humanity takes place.47. Steadiness and ease of posture is to be achieved through persistent slighteffort and through the concentration of the mind upon the infinite.This covers the two aspects which in meditation produce difficulty, the comfortof the body and the control of the mind. It is noteworthy that the effort toattain forgetfulness of the physical body through correct posture is broughtabout through steady gentle persistent practise, rather than through the violentforcing of the body into postures and attitudes unaccustomed and uncomfortable.When this can be done and when the mind can be so engrossed upon a considerationof the things of the soul, then steadiness and ease characterize the man on thephysical plane. He is forgetful of the physical vehicle and hence canconcentrate the mind, and his concentration of the mind is then so one-pointedthat thought of the body becomes impossible.48. When this is attained, the pairs of opposites no longer limit.The pairs of opposites concern the desire body and it is significant that in thepreceding sutra [216] only the mind and the physical body were dealt with. Inthis sutra the emotional nature, expressing itself through desire fails to beinfluenced by the pull of any attractive force. The astral body becomesquiescent and non-assertive, unresponsive to any lure from the world ofillusion.There is a great mystery concerned with the astral body of man and with theastral light, and the nature of the mystery is still only known to advancedinitiates. The astral light is thrown into objectivity by two producing factors,and the astral body of a man is responsive to two types of energy. They seemessentially in themselves to lack character or form but to be dependent formanifestation upon “that which is above and that which is below.” The desirenature of man, for instance, seems to respond to the lure of the great world ofillusion, the maya of the senses, or to the voice of the ego, using the mentalbody. Vibrations reach the astral body from the physical plane and from themental world, and according to the nature of the man and to the point inevolution which he has reached, so will be the response to the higher or thelower call.The astral body is either attentive to the egoic impression or swayed by themillion voices of earth. It apparently has no voice of its own, no character ofits own. This has been pictured for us in the Gita where Arjuna stands midwaybetween the two opposing forces of good and evil and searches for the rightattitude to both. The astral plane is the battleground of the soul, the place ofvictory or the place of defeat; it is the [217] kurukshetra, upon which thegreat choice is made.In these sutras concerning posture, the same idea lies latent. The physicalplane and the mental plane are emphasized and it is brought out that when theyare adjusted rightly, when poise on the physical plane and one pointedness onthe mental plane are attained, then the pairs of opposites no longer limit. Thepoint of balance is reached and the man is liberated. The scales of a man’s lifeare absolutely adjusted and he stands free.MEANS IV. PRANAYAMA49. When right posture (asana) has been attained there follows right control ofprana and proper inspiration and expiration of the breath.Here again we come to a sutra that has led to much misunderstanding and muchmischief. Teaching on the control of prana is prevalent and has led to thefollowing of breathing exercises and to the practices dependent for theirsuccess upon the suspension of the breathing process. Most of this has beencaused by a belief in the occidental mind that prana and breath are synonymousterms. This is by no means the case. Vivekananda points this out in hiscommentary on the sutra in the following words:“When the posture has been conquered, then this motion is to be broken andcontrolled, and thus we come to pranayama; the controlling of the vital forcesof the body. Prana is not breath, [218] though it is usually so translated. Itis the sum total of the cosmic energy. It is the energy that is in each body,and its most apparent manifestation is the motion of the lungs. This motion iscaused by prana drawing in the breath, and is what we seek to control inpranayama. We begin by controlling the breath, as the easiest way of gettingcontrol of the prana.”Prana is the sum total of the energy in the body (and this applies equally tothe planetary and the solar body). It therefore concerns the inflow of energyinto the etheric body and its outflow through the medium of the physical body.In the physical body this is symbolized for us in the necessary inspiration andexhalation of the breath. By stressing the physical act of breathing, much ofthe true sense of this sutra has been lost.Certain things should be remembered as one studies pranayama. First, that one ofthe main purposes of the etheric body is that it acts as a stimulator and theenergizer of the dense physical body. It is almost as if the dense physical bodyhad no independent existence but simply acted as it was swayed and motivated bythe etheric body. The etheric body is the force or vital body and it permeatesevery part of the dense vehicle. It is the background, the true substance of thephysical body. According to the nature of the force animating the etheric body,according to the activity of that force in the etheric body, according to thealiveness or the sluggishness of the most important parts of the etheric body(the centres up the [219] spine) so will be the corresponding activity of thephysical body. Similarly and symbolically, according to the wholeness of thebreathing apparatus, and according to the ability of that apparatus to oxygenateand render pure the blood, so will be the health or wholeness of the densephysical body.It should also be remembered that the key to the just response of the lower tothe higher, lies in rhythm, and in the ability of the physical body to respondor vibrate in rhythmic unison with the etheric body. Students have found outthat this is much facilitated by steady even breathing, and the majority of thebreathing exercises when emphasized to the exclusion of the previous three meansto yoga (the Commandments, Rules and Posture) have a definite effect upon theetheric centres and may lead to disastrous results. It is most necessary thatstudents should follow the means of yoga in the order in which they are given byPatanjali, and so see to it that the purificatory process, the discipline of theouter and inner life and one-pointedness of the mind should be aimed at, priorto attempting the regulation of the etheric vehicle through breathing, and theawakening of the centres.The work done through pranayama might briefly be stated to be the following:1. The oxygenation of the blood and hence the cleansing of the blood currentsand consequent physical health.2. The bringing of the physical body into a vibration synchronous with that ofthe etheric [220] body. This results in the complete subjugation of the densephysical body and its bringing into line with the etheric body. The two parts ofthe physical vehicle form a unit.3. The transmission of energy via the etheric body to all parts of the densephysical body. This energy may come from various sources:a. From the planetary aura. In this case it is planetary prana, and so concernsprimarily the spleen and the health of the physical body.b. From the astral world via the astral body. This will be purely kamic ordesire force and will affect primarily the centres below the diaphragm.c. From the universal mind or manasic force. This will be largely thought forceand will go to the throat centre.d. From the ego itself, stimulating primarily the head and heart centres.Most people receive force only from the physical and astral planes, butdisciples receive force also from the mental and egoic levels.50. Right control of prana (or the life currents) is external, internal ormotionless; it is subject to place, time and number and is also protracted orbrief.This is a most difficult sutra to understand and its meaning has been madepurposely abstruse, owing to the dangers incident to the control of the bodilyforces. The ideas and teaching conveyed fall into three parts:I. The external, internal or motionless control [221] of the life currents ofthe body (dense and etheric). This concerns:1. The breathing apparatus and the use of the breath.2. The vital airs and their radiation.3. The centres, and their awakening.4. The kundalini fire and its right progression up the spine.II. The astrological significance and the relation of the man to his group,planetary or otherwise. This is dealt with in the words “place, time andnumber.”III. The process of illumination and the production of response in the physicalman via the brain to the higher impressions. This ability to respond to thevoice of the ego and to become quiescent and receptive must precede the lastfour means of yoga which do not so immediately concern the dense physical planeor the etheric levels of consciousness.It will be obvious that much of the teaching conveyed in this sutra can onlysafely be given directly by the teacher to the pupil, after a proper study ofthe bodily conditions of that pupil. It is not possible nor right to give in abook intended for the general public those rules, practices and methods whichenable the trained disciple to bring his dense physical vehicle intoinstantaneous synchronization with his etheric body, to densify and irradiatehis aura so as to produce certain magnetic results in his environment, and toawaken his centres so that certain psychic powers are displayed. The methods forarousing the kundalini [222] fire and blending it with the downpouring egoicforce must also be left for direct teaching by a master in this science to hispupil. There is extreme danger attendant upon the premature awakening of thefire, and the consequent destruction of certain protective structures in theetheric body and the breaking down of the barriers between this world and theastral world, before the pupil is properly “balanced between the pairs ofopposites”. There is a menace in the premature growth of the lower psychicpowers before the higher nature is awakened, and the effect upon the brain canbe seen as insanity in some form or other, mild or the reverse. A fewexplanatory words can, however, be given which will enable the true occultstudent to gain that information which, if correctly used, acts as a key to thepossession of more. This is ever the occult method. Let us, therefore, dealbriefly with our three points.I. The external control of the prana or life currents concerns those breathingexercises and rhythmic practices which bring the physical organs, allied withthe etheric centres, into proper condition. These physical organs are themselvesnever specifically dealt with by the white magician or occultist. They are dealtwith in black magic, and consist of the brain, the lungs, the heart, the spleenand the generative organs.The black magician definitely utilizes these physical parts of the body togenerate a type of force which is a mixture of etheric force and dense physicalenergy, to enable him to do certain [223] forms of magical work and also toproduce effects on the physical bodies of animals and men. It is the knowledgeof this which is the basis of voodooism and of all those practices which causethe depletion and death of men and women who obstruct the path of the blackmagician or are regarded by him as enemies. With these the aspirant to themysteries of the Brotherhood of the great White Lodge has nothing to do. Hebrings about the merging of the two parts of the dense physical, and thesynchronization of the rhythm of the two bodies and the consequent unity of theentire lower man through attention to the etheric breath and rhythm. Thisinevitably produces the “external control of the life currents.”The internal control of the life currents is brought about in three ways:1. By an intellectual understanding of the nature of the etheric body and thelaws of its life.2. Through a consideration of the types of energy and of their apparatus, thesystem of centres, to be found in the etheric body.3. Through certain developments and knowledge which come to the aspirant when heis ready (having attended to the previous means of yoga) and which give him theability to tap certain types of forces, energies, or shaktis, to utilize themcorrectly through the medium of his own centres and to produce effects whichcome under the descriptive terms, illuminative, purificatory, magnetic, dynamic,psychic, and magic.The motionless control of the life currents is the effect of the properdevelopment of the other [224] two, external and internal control and must bepresent before the fifth means of yoga, withdrawal or abstraction becomespossible. It simply indicates perfectly balanced synchronization and thecomplete unification of the two parts of the physical body so that there is noimpediment to the outgoing or incoming forces. When motionless control isreached, the yogi can withdraw from his physical body at will or can pull inthat body and manipulate at will any of the seven great planetary forces.It should be borne in mind that the ideal condition is here dealt with and thatno aspirant can achieve this means of yoga without working simultaneously at theother means also. The study of the parallelism in nature is of value here.II. The astrological significance is also hinted at here in the three words,“place, time, and number.” In these words the universal triplicities must berecognized, and right control of the life currents must be seen to be related tokarma, opportunity and form; there are certain words which when rightlyunderstood give the key to all practical occultism and make the yogi a master oflife. They are:Sound Number Colour Form Word Life Light Bodyand these are recognized as subject to the space-idea and the time-element. Itshould be borne in mind, in this connection, that “space is the first entity”(Secret Doctrine I. 583) and that cyclic manifestation is the law of life. [225]When this is recognized, the entity, expressing itself cyclically, will make itspresence felt through differentiation, through the colour or quality of theveiling form and through the form itself. These factors make up the sum total ofthe expression of any identity, God or man, and the appearance of any man inexoteric expression on the physical plane is dependent upon the rhythmic orcyclic outgoing or indrawing energy of the great Life in whom he lives and movesand has his being. This is the basis of the science of astrology or therelationship of the planet, or planets to the human being and of their relationto the stars and the various signs of the zodiac.Some knowledge of this is essential to the right control of the life currents,so that the disciple can avail himself of the “times and seasons” whereinprogress can be expedited.III. The process of illuminating the lower man becomes possible through theright control of the pranas and this “illuminating process” is an exact sciencefor which these four means of yoga have prepared the way. The fires of the bodyare justly arranged, the “motionless” condition can be somewhat reached, thevital airs in the head are “at peace” and the entire lower man awaits one of twoprocesses:a. The withdrawal of the true or spiritual man in order to function on somehigher plane,b. Or the bringing down into the lower brain consciousness, of light,illumination and knowledge from the planes of the ego. [226]51. There is a fourth stage which transcends those dealing with the internal andexternal phases.We have seen how the control of the life currents can be either externallyactive, internally active or balanced. This triple process brings the entirelower personal man into a condition, first of rhythmic response to the innermotivating factor (in this case, the ego or spiritual man on his own plane) andthen of complete quiescence or stillness. This latter condition of receptivewaiting, if one might so call it, is succeeded by one of a form of higheractivity. This is literally the imposition of a new rate of vibration on thelower, the sounding forth of a new note, emanating from the inner spiritual manwhich produces certain definite effects in the three sheaths which constitutethe lower self and which veil the divinity which is man. These changes are dealtwith in the next two sutras.The work of the average aspirant is most frequently given to preparing thesheaths so that this fourth stage can become possible. His attention isconcentrated upon the attainment of:1. The conscious coordination of the three bodies or sheaths,2. Their due alignment,3. The regulation of the rhythm of the sheaths so that they are synchronizedwith each other and with the rate of the egoic impression,4. Their unification into one coherent whole [227] so that the man is literallythe three in one and the one in three,5. Quiescence, or the attitude of positive receptivity to the higher inspirationand downflow of egoic life and energy.It may help the student if he realizes that the right control of prana involvesthe recognition that energy is the sum total of existence and of manifestation,and that the three lower bodies are energy bodies, each forming a vehicle forthe higher type of energy and being themselves transmitters of energy. Theenergies of the lower man are energies of the third aspect, the Holy Ghost orBrahma aspect. The energy of the spiritual man is that of the second aspect, theChrist force, or buddhi. The object of evolution in the human family is to bringthis Christ force, the principle of buddhi, into full manifestation upon thephysical plane and this through the utilization of the lower triple sheath. Thistriple sheath is the Holy Grail, the cup which is the receiver and container ofthe life of God. When the lower man is brought into proper response throughattention to the four means of yoga already considered, two results begin tomanifest in him and he is ready to use the remaining four means which willreorient him and bring him eventually to liberation.52. Through this, that which obscures the light is gradually removed.The first result is the gradual wearing away, or attenuation of the materialforms which hide [228] the reality. This does not mean the wasting away of theforms but the steady refining and transmutation of the matter with which theyare constructed so that they become so purified and clarified that the “Light ofGod” which they have hitherto hidden, can shine forth in all its beauty in thethree worlds. This can be demonstrated as literally true upon the physicalplane, for through the work of purification and the control of the life currentsthe light in the head becomes so apparent that it can be seen by those who havesupernatural vision, as radiations extending all around the head, thus formingthe halo so well known in pictures of the saints. The halo is a fact in natureand not just a symbol. It is the result of the work of Raja Yoga and is thephysical demonstration of the life and light of the spiritual man. Vivekanandasays, speaking technically (and it is good for Western occult students to masterthe technique and terminology of this science of the soul which the East hasheld in trust for so long):“The chitta has, by its own nature, all knowledge. It is made of sattvaparticles, but is covered by rajas and tamas particles, and by pranayama thiscovering is removed.”53. And the mind is prepared for concentrated meditation.Johnston’s edition gives a beautiful rendering of this sutra in the words:“Thence comes the mind’s power to hold itself in the light—,” the idea beingthat once the condition of quiescence [229] has been reached, and the fourthstage of supernormal impression has been made possible, the remaining means ofyoga, abstraction, attention, meditation and contemplation can be properlyundertaken. The mind can be gripped and used and the process of transmitting theknowledge, light and wisdom from the ego or soul, to the brain via the mind canbe safely undertaken.MEANS V. ABSTRACTION54. Abstraction (or Pratyahara) is the subjugation of the senses by the thinkingprinciple and their withdrawal from that which has hitherto been their object.This sutra summarizes for us the work done in the control of the psychic nature,and gives us the result achieved when the thinker, through the medium of themind, the thinking principle, so dominates the senses that they have noindependent expression of their own.Before attention, meditation and contemplation, (the last three means of yoga)can be properly undertaken, not only must the outer conduct be corrected, notonly must inner purity be arrived at, not only must the right attitude towardsall things be cultivated and the life currents consequently controlled, but thecapacity to subjugate the outgoing tendencies of the five senses must be workedat. So the aspirant is taught the right withdrawal or abstraction of theconsciousness which is outgoing towards the world of phenomena, [230] and mustlearn to centre his consciousness in the great central station in the head fromwhence energy can be consciously distributed as he participates in the greatwork, from whence he can make a contact with the realm of the soul and in whichhe can receive the messages and impressions which emanate from that realm. Thisis a definite stage of achievement and is not simply a symbolic way ofexpressing one-pointed interest.The various avenues of sense perception are brought into a quiescent condition.The consciousness of the real man no longer surges outwards along its fiveavenues of contact. The five senses are dominated by the sixth sense, the mindand all the consciousness and the perceptive faculty of the aspirant issynthesized in the head, and turns inward and upward. The psychic nature isthereby subjugated and the mental plane becomes the field of man’s activity.This withdrawal or abstracting process proceeds in stages:1. The withdrawal of the physical consciousness, or perception through hearing,touch, sight, taste and smell. These modes of perception become temporarilydormant, and man’s perception becomes simply mental and the brain consciousnessis all that is active on the physical plane.2. The withdrawal of the consciousness into the region of the pineal gland, sothat man’s point of realization is centralized in the region between the middleof the forehead and the pineal gland.3. The next stage is that of abstracting the [231] consciousness into the headcentre, the thousand petalled lotus or sahasara, by knowingly withdrawing theconsciousness out of the head. This can be done in full waking consciousnesswhen certain rules are learned and certain work accomplished. These canobviously not be given in such a work as this. The majority of people have tomaster the first two stages and learn to control the avenues of perception, thefive senses.4. The abstracting of the consciousness into the astral body and thus freeing itfrom the physical plane.5. A still further withdrawal into the mental body or the mind so that neitherthe physical nor the astral any longer limit or confine the man.When this can be done, true meditation and contemplation becomes possible.Dvivedi says in his commentary on this sutra:“Abstraction consists in the senses becoming entirely assimilated to, orcontrolled by the mind. They must be drawn away from their objects and fixedupon the mind and assimilated to it, so that by preventing the transformation ofthe thinking principle, the sense also will follow it and be immediatelycontrolled. Not only this but they will be ever ready to contribute collectivelytoward the absorbing meditation of any given thing at any moment.”The result, therefore, of correct abstraction or withdrawal is briefly:1. The synthesis of the senses by the sixth sense, the mind. [232]2. The alignment of the threefold lower man so that the three bodies function asa coordinated unit.3. The freeing of the man from the limitations of the bodies.4. The consequent ability of the soul or ego to impress and illuminate the brainthrough the medium of the mind.55. As a result of these means there follows the complete subjugation of thesense organs.In Book I a general indication was given of the objective of Raja Yoga and ofthe hindrances to its practice coupled with an indication of the benefits. InBook II which we have just completed, the hindrances are specifically dealtwith, the method of correcting them is indicated and then the means of yoga aretaken up, five out of the eight being considered and explained. These fivemeans, when duly followed, bring a man to the point where his lower psychicnature is being controlled, the senses are being mastered and he can begin toundertake the subjugation of the sixth sense, the mind.The methods whereby the mind is controlled and the aspirant becomes completemaster of the entire lower man are taken up in the next book. The remainingthree means of yoga are explained and then the results of yoga are given indetail. Students will find it useful to note the graded and accurate methodoutlined in this marvellous treatise. It is valuable to note its brevity and yetits [233] concise and complete nature. It is the text book of an exact scienceand within its few short pages are gathered all the rules, necessary in theAryan rootrace, for the complete control of the mind, which should be thecontribution of that race to the evolutionary process."},{"pageContent":"BOOK III. - UNION ACHIEVED AND ITS RESULTS...TOPIC: THE POWERS OF THE SOUL.[237] 1. Concentration is the fixing of the chitta (mind stuff) upon aparticular object. This is dharana.2. Sustained concentration (dharana) is meditation (dhyana).3. When the chitta becomes absorbed in that which is the reality (or ideaembodied in the form), and is unaware of separateness or the personal self, thisis contemplation or samadhi.4. When concentration, meditation and contemplation form one sequential act,then is sanyama achieved.5. As a result of sanyama comes the shining forth of the light.6. This illumination is gradual; it is developed stage by stage.7. These last three means of yoga have a more intimate subjective effect thanthe previous means.8. Even these three, however, are external to the true seedless meditation (orsamadhi) which is not based on an object. It is free from the effects of thediscriminative nature of the chitta (or mind stuff).9. The sequence of mental states is as follows: the mind reacts to that which isseen; then follows the moment of mind control. Then ensues a moment wherein thechitta (mind stuff) responds to both these factors. Finally these pass away, andthe perceiving consciousness has full sway.10. Through the cultivation of this habit of mind there will eventuate asteadiness of spiritual perception. [238]11. The establishing of this habit, and the restraining of the mind from itsthought-form-making tendency, results eventually in the constant power tocontemplate.12. When mind control and the controlling factor are equally balanced, thencomes the condition of one-pointedness.13. Through this process the aspects of every object are known, theircharacteristics (or form), their symbolic nature, and their specific use intime-conditions (stage of development) are known and realised.14. The characteristics of every object are acquired, manifesting or latent.15. The stage of development is responsible for the various modifications of theversatile psychic nature and of the thinking principle.16. Through concentrated meditation upon the triple nature of every form, comesthe revelation of that which has been and of that which will be.17. The Sound (or word), that which it denotes (the object) and the embodiedspiritual essence (or idea) are usually confused in the mind of the perceiver.By concentrated meditation on these three aspects comes an (intuitive)comprehension of the sound uttered by all forms of life.18. Knowledge of previous incarnations becomes available when the power to seethought-images is acquired.19. Through concentrated meditation, the thought images in the minds of otherpeople become apparent.20. As, however, the object of those thoughts is not apparent to the perceiver,he sees only the thought and not the object. His meditation excludes thetangible.21. By concentrated meditation upon the distinction between form and body, thoseproperties of the body which make it visible to the human eye are negated (orwithdrawn) and the yogi can render himself invisible.22. Karma (or effects) are of two kinds: immediate karma or future karma. Byperfectly concentrated [239] meditation on these, the yogi knows the term of hisexperience in the three worlds. This knowledge comes also from signs.23. Union with others is to be gained through one-pointed meditation upon thethree states of feeling—compassion, tenderness and dispassion.24. Meditation, one-pointedly centered upon the power of the elephant, willawaken that force or light.25. Perfectly concentrated meditation upon the awakened light will produce theconsciousness of that which is subtle, hidden or remote.26. Through meditation, one-pointedly fixed upon the sun, will come aconsciousness (or knowledge) of the seven worlds.27. A knowledge of all lunar forms arises through one-pointed meditation uponthe moon.28. Concentration upon the Pole-Star will give knowledge of the orbits of theplanets and the stars.29. By concentrated attention upon the centre called the solar plexus, comesperfected knowledge as to the condition of the body.30. By fixing the attention upon the throat centre, the cessation of hunger andthirst will ensue.31. By fixing the attention upon the tube or nerve below the throat centre,equilibrium is achieved.32. Those who have attained self-mastery can be seen and contacted throughfocussing the light in the head. This power is developed in one-pointedmeditation.33. All things can be known in the vivid light of the intuition.34. Understanding of the mind-consciousness comes from one-pointed meditationupon the heart centre.35. Experience (of the pairs of opposites) comes from the inability of the soulto distinguish between the personal self and the purusa (or spirit). Theobjective forms exist for the use (and experience) of the spiritual man. Bymeditation upon this, arises the intuitive perception of the spiritual nature(the purusa). [240]36. As the result of this experience and meditation, the higher hearing, touch,sight, taste and smell are developed, producing intuitional knowledge.37. These powers are obstacles to the highest spiritual realisation, but serveas magical powers in the objective worlds.38. By liberation from the causes of bondage through their weakening and by anunderstanding of the mode of transference (withdrawal or entrance), the mindstuff (or chitta) can enter another body.39. By subjugation of the upward life (the udana) there is liberation fromwater, the thorny path, and mire, and the power of ascension is gained.40. Through subjugation of the samana, the spark becomes the flame.41. By the means of one-pointed meditation upon the relationship between theakasha and sound, an organ for spiritual hearing will be developed.42. By one-pointed meditation upon the relationship existing between the bodyand the akasha, ascension out of matter (the three worlds) and power to travelin space is gained.43. When that which veils the light is done away with, then comes the state ofbeing called discarnate (or disembodied), freed from the modification of thethinking principle. This is the state of illumination.44. One-pointed meditation upon the five forms which every element takes,produces mastery over every element. These five forms are the gross nature, theelemental form, the quality, the pervasiveness and the basic purpose.45. Through this mastery, minuteness and the other siddhis (or powers) areattained, likewise bodily perfection and freedom from all hindrances.46. Symmetry of form, beauty of colour, strength and the compactness of thediamond, constitute bodily perfection.47. Mastery over the senses is brought about through concentrated meditationupon their nature, peculiar attributes, egoism, pervasiveness and usefulpurpose. [241]48. As a result of this perfection, there comes rapidity of action like that ofmind, perception independent of the organs, and mastery over root substance.49. The man who can discriminate between the soul and the spirit achievessupremacy over all conditions and becomes omniscient.50. By a passionless attitude towards this attainment and towards allsoul-powers, the one who is free from the seeds of bondage, attains thecondition of isolated unity.51. There should be entire rejection of all allurements from all forms of being,even the celestial, for the recurrence of evil contacts remains possible.52. Intuitive knowledge is developed through the use of the discriminativefaculty when there is one-pointed concentration upon moments and theircontinuous succession.53. From this intuitive knowledge is born the capacity to distinguish (betweenall beings) and to cognize their genus, qualities and position in space.54. This intuitive knowledge, which is the great Deliverer, is omnipresent andomniscient and includes the past, the present and the future in the Eternal Now.55. When the objective forms and the soul have reached a condition of equalpurity, then is At-one-ment achieved and liberation results.Meditation, and its stages[243] 1. Concentration is the fixing of the chitta (mind stuff) upon aparticular object. This is dharana.We have now reached the part of the Yoga Sutras which deals specifically withmind control and with the effect of that control. The first fifteen sutras aregiven to the control of the mind and how it is to be attained and the remainingforty sutras concern the results which take place after this control has beengained. Twenty-four results are enumerated, and these are all along the line ofexpansions of consciousness and the demonstration of psychic faculties, bothlower and higher.The first step towards this unfoldment is concentration, or the ability to holdthe mind steadily and unwaveringly upon that which the aspirant chooses. Thisfirst step is one of the most difficult [244] stages in the meditation processand involves constant unremitting ability to keep bringing the mind back to that“object” upon which the aspirant has chosen to concentrate. The stages inconcentration are themselves well marked and can be stated as follows:1. The choice of some “object” upon which to concentrate,2. The withdrawing of the mind-consciousness from the periphery of the body, sothat the avenues of outer perception and contact (the five senses) are stilled,and the consciousness is no longer outgoing,3. The centering of the consciousness and its steadying within the head at apoint midway between the eyebrows,4. The application of the mind, or the paying of close attention to the objectchosen for concentration,5. The visualization of that object, imaginative perception of it and logicalreasoning about it,6. The extension of the mental concepts which have been formed from the specificand particular to the general and the universal or cosmic,7. An attempt to arrive at that which lies back of the form considered, or toreach the idea which is responsible for the form.This process gradually steps up the consciousness and enables the aspirant toarrive at the life side of manifestation instead of the form side. He beginshowever with the form or “object.” Objects upon which to concentrate are of fourkinds: [245]1. External objects , such as images of the deity, pictures or forms in nature,2. Internal objects , such as the centres in the etheric body,3. Qualities , such as the various virtues, with the intent to awaken desire forthese virtues and thus to build them into the content of the personal life,4. Mental concepts or those ideas which embody the ideals lying back of allanimated forms. These may take the form of symbols or of words.In one of the Puranas the idea embodied in concentration is expressed mostbeautifully. The aspirant is told, after he has made use of the first five meansof yoga (dealt with in Book II), that he “should make a localization of the mindstuff upon some auspicious support” and this localization is illustrated by adescription of the fixing of the attention upon a form of God.“The incarnated form of the Exalted One leaves one without desire for any othersupport. This should be understood to be fixed attention, when the mind stuff isfixed upon this form. And what is this incarnate form of Hari on which oneshould ponder, let that be heard by thee, O Ruler of Men. Fixed attention is notpossible without something on which to fix it.” (Vishnu Purana VI. 7. 75-85.)Then follows a description of the incarnated form of the Exalted One, concludingwith these words:“. . . upon Him let the yogin ponder; and lost in Him, concentrate his own minduntil, O, King, the fixed attention becomes firmly fixed upon Him only. While[246] performing this or while doing, as he wills, some other action wherein hismind does not wander, he should then deem this fixed attention to be perfected.”(Naradiya Purana LXVII. 54-62.)It is the realization of the necessity for “objects” in concentration thatoriginated the demand for images, sacred sculptures and pictures. All theseobjects entail the use of the lower concrete mind and this is the necessarypreliminary stage. Their use brings the mind into a controlled condition so thatthe aspirant can make it do just what he chooses. The four types of objectsmentioned above carry the aspirant gradually inwards and enable him to transferhis consciousness from the physical plane into the etheric realm, from thenceinto the world of desire or of the emotions, and so into the world of mentalideas and concepts. This process, which is carried on within the brain, bringsthe entire lower man into a state of one-pointed coherent attention, all partsof his nature being directed to the attainment of fixed attention or aconcentration of all the mental faculties. The mind then is no longerscattering, unsteady and outgoing, but is fully “fixed in attention.”Vivekananda translates “dharana” as “holding the mind to one thought for twelveseconds.”This clear, one-pointed, still perception of an object, without any other objector thought entering into one’s consciousness is most difficult of achievement,and when it can be done for the space of twelve seconds, true concentration isbeing achieved. [247]2. Sustained Concentration (dharana) is meditation (dhyana).Meditation is but the extension of concentration and grows out of the facility aman achieves in “fixing the mind” at will on any particular object. It fallsunder the same rules and conditions as concentration and the only distinctionbetween the two is in the time element.Having achieved the capacity to focus the mind steadily upon an object, the nextstep is developing the power to hold the mind stuff or chitta unwaveringlyoccupied with that object or thought for a prolonged period. The Purana quotedabove continues:“An uninterrupted succession of presented ideas single in intent upon His form,without desire for anything else, that, O King, is contemplation. It is broughtabout by the first six aids of yoga.”The word contemplation here is synonymous with meditation. This meditation isstill with seed or with an object.Dvivedi says in his comment on this sutra:“... Dhyana is the entire fixing of the mind on the object thought of (to theextent of making it one with it). In fact, the mind should, at the time, beconscious only of itself and the object.”The man’s attitude becomes pure fixed attention; his physical body, hisemotions, surroundings, and all sounds and sights are lost sight of and thebrain is conscious only of the object which is the topic or seed of meditation,and the thoughts which the mind is formulating in connection with that object.[248]3. When the chitta becomes absorbed in that which is the reality (or ideaembodied in the form), and is unaware of separateness or of the personal self,this is contemplation or samadhi.The simplest way in which to comprehend this sutra is to realize that every formor object is a manifested life of some kind or another. In the early stages ofthe meditation process, the student becomes aware of the nature of the form andof his relation to it. The two states in which he is conscious of himself and ofthe object of his meditation are entirely mental conditions; they exist withinhis mind.This condition is followed by one in which his realization travels inward on tothe subjective plane and he becomes aware of the nature of the life which isexpressing itself through the form. Quality and subjective relationships engrosshis attention and the form aspect is lost sight of, but still the sense ofseparateness or of duality persists. He is still aware of himself and of thatwhich is the not-self. Similarity of quality and response to analogous vibrationare his, however.In the two stages of dharana and dhyana, of concentration and of meditation, themind is the important factor and is the producer in the brain. A great Hinduteacher, Kecidhvaja , expresses this idea in the following words:“The soul has the means. Thinking is the means. It is inanimate. When thinkinghas completed its task of release, it has done what it had to do and ceases.”(From the Vishnu Parana. VI. 7:90.) [249]The truth of this makes any description or explanation of the high state ofsamadhi or contemplation exceedingly difficult, for words and phrases are butthe effort of the mind to submit to the brain of the personal self that whichwill enable it to appreciate and comprehend the process.In contemplation, the yogi loses sight of:1. His brain consciousness or the physical plane apprehensions as to time andspace.2. His emotional reactions to the subject of his meditation process.3. His mental activities, so that all the “modifications” of the thinkingprocess, all the emotional reactions of the desire-mind (kama-manas) vehicle aresubdued and the yogi is unaware of them. He is, however, intensely alive andalert, positive and awake, for the brain and the mind are held by him in asteady grip, and are used by him without any interference on their part.This literally means that the independent life of these forms through which thereal self is functioning is still, quieted and subdued, and the real orspiritual man, awake on his own plane, is able to function with full use of thebrain, sheaths and mind of the lower self, his vehicle or instrument. He is,therefore, centred in himself or in the soul aspect. All sense of separatenessor of the lower personal self are lost sight of, and he becomes identified withthe soul of that form which has been the object of his meditation.Unhindered by the mind stuff, or by the desire [250] nature he “enters into”that condition which has four outstanding characteristics:1. Absorption in the soul consciousness and therefore awareness of the soul ofall things. Form is no longer seen, and the vision of the reality, veiled by allforms, is revealed.2. Liberation from the three worlds of sense perception, so that only is knownand contacted which is free from form, from desire and from lower concretemental substance.3. Realization of oneness with all souls, subhuman, human, and superhuman. Groupconsciousness somewhat expresses the idea, just as separated consciousness, orrealization of one’s own individual identity, characterizes consciousness in thethree worlds.4. Illumination or perception of the light aspect of manifestation. Throughmeditation the yogi knows himself to be light, a point of fiery essence. Throughfacility in the meditation process he can focus that light on any object hechooses and come “en rapport” with the light which that object is hiding. Thatlight is then known to be one in essence with his own light-centre, andcomprehension, communication and identification then become possible.4. When concentration, meditation and contemplation form one sequential act,then is sanyama achieved.This is a most difficult idea to express for we have not in the English languagethe equivalent [251 ] of the Sanskrit term “sanyama.” It is the synthesis ofthe three stages of the meditation process and is only possible to that studentwho has learnt and mastered the three states of mind control. Through thatmastery he has produced certain results, which are as follows:1. He has freed himself from the three worlds of mind, emotion and physicalplane existence. They no longer attract his attention. He is not concentratedupon, or engrossed by them.2. He can focus his attention at will and can hold his mind steady indefinitely,whilst working intensively in the mental world, should he so choose.3. He can polarize or centre himself in the consciousness of the ego, soul orspiritual man, and knows himself as separate from the mind, the emotions,desires, feelings and form which constitute the lower man.4. He has learnt to recognize that lower man (the sum total of mental states, ofemotions and physical atoms) as simply his instrument for communicating at willwith the three lower planes.5. He has acquired the faculty of contemplation or the attitude of the realIdentity towards the realm of the soul and can look out on the soul-realm in asense corresponding to the way a man can use his eyes to see on the physicalplane.6. He can transmit to the brain, via the controlled mind, that which he sees,and can thus impart knowledge of the self and of its kingdom to the man on thephysical plane.This is perfectly concentrated meditation and [252] the power so to meditate iscalled sanyama in this sutra. It is the attainment of the power of meditationwhich is the objective of the Raja Yoga system. Through this achievement, theyogi has learnt to differentiate between the object and that which the objectveils or hides. He has learnt to pierce through all veils and contact thereality behind. He has achieved a working knowledge of duality.There is yet a higher consciousness than this, that realization which is coveredby the term unity, but as yet it is not his. This is, however, a very high stageand produces in the physical man astounding effects and introduces him tovarious forms of phenomena.5. As a result of sanyama comes the shining forth of the light.There are several terms used here by various commentators and translators and itmight be of interest to consider some of them, for in the variousinterpretations will come a full understanding of the Sanskrit terms.Briefly, the idea involves the conception that the nature of the soul is light,and that light is the great revealer. The yogi, through steady practise inmeditation, has reached the point where he can at will, turn the light whichradiates from his very being, in any direction, and can illumine any subject.Nothing can therefore be hid from him and all knowledge is at his disposal. Thispower is therefore described as: [253]1. Illumination of perception. The light of the soul pours forth and the man onthe physical plane, in his brain consciousness, is thereby enabled to perceivethat which before was dark and hidden from him. The process may technically bedescribed in the following concise terms:a. Meditation,b. Polarization in the soul or egoic consciousness,c. Contemplation, or the turning of the soul-light upon that which is to beknown or investigated,d. The subsequent pouring down of the knowledge ascertained, in a “stream ofillumination” into the brain, via the sutratma, the thread-soul, silver cord, ormagnetic link. This thread passes through the mind and illumines it. Thethoughts engendered in the automatic response of the chitta (or mind stuff) tothe knowledge conveyed, are then impressed upon the brain and the man, in hisphysical consciousness, becomes cognizant of what the soul knows. He becomesillumined.As this process becomes more frequent and steady, a change takes place in thephysical man. He becomes more and more synchronized with the soul. The timeelement in transmission recedes into the background and the illumination of thefield of knowledge by the light of the soul and the illumining of the physicalbrain, becomes an instantaneous happening.The light in the head increases in a corresponding degree and the third eyedevelops and functions. On the astral and mental plane a corresponding [254]“eye” develops, and thus the ego or soul can illumine all the three planes inthe three worlds as well as the soul realm.2. Lucidity of consciousness. A man becomes lucid and clear sighted. He isconscious of a growing power in himself which will enable him to explain andsolve all problems, and not only this, but “lucidly to speak” and thus becomeone of the teaching forces of the world. All knowledge, consciously acquired byself illumination must be shared, and clearly imparted to others. It is thecorollary of illumination.3. The shining forth of insight. This gives a new angle on the subject and amost important one. It is the definition of the capacity to “see into” a form,to arrive at that subjective reality which has made the objective sheath what itis. This insight is more than understanding, sympathy or comprehension. They arebut the effects of it. It is the capacity to pierce through all forms and arriveat that which they veil, because that reality is identical with the reality inoneself.4. The illumining of the intellect. Unless the mind or intellect can grasp andtransmit that which the soul knows, the mysteries remain unexplained to thephysical brain and the knowledge possessed by the soul must remain nothing morethan a beautiful and unattainable vision. But once the intellect is illumined,it can transmit to and impress upon the brain those hidden things which only thesons of God on their own plane know. Hence the need for Raja Yoga or the [255]science of union through mind control and development.6. This illumination is gradual; it is developed stage by stage.The evolutionary nature of all growth and unfoldment is dealt with here and theaspirant is reminded that nothing is accomplished at once but only as the resultof long and steady effort.One thing that every aspirant to the mysteries should remember is that growththat is gradual, and relatively slow, is the method of every natural process andthis soul unfoldment is, after all, but one of the great processes of nature.All that the aspirant has to do is to provide the right conditions. The growththen will take care of itself normally. Steady perseverance, patient endurance,the achievement of a little every day, are of more value to the aspirant thanthe violent rushing forward and the enthusiastic endeavour of the emotional andtemperamental person. The undue forcing of one’s development carries with itcertain most definite and specific dangers. These are avoided when the studentrealizes that the path is long and that an intelligent understanding of eachstage of the path is of more value to him than the results achieved through thepremature awakening of the psychic nature. The injunction to grow as the flowergrows, carries with it a tremendous occult truth. There is an injunction in Ecc.VII. 16, which carries this thought, “Be not righteous over much, . . . whyshouldest thou die?” [256]7. These last three means of yoga have a more intimate subjective effect thanthe previous means.The first five means of yoga have for their primary objective the preparation ofthe would-be yogi. Through keeping the Commandments and the Rules, through theachievements of poise and rhythmic control of the energies of the body, andthrough the power to withdraw his consciousness and centre it in the head, theaspirant is enabled to take full advantage of, and safely to cultivate thepowers of concentration, meditation and contemplation.Having contacted the subjective in himself and become aware of that which isinterior, he can begin to work with the interior, internal and intimate means.The entire eight means of yoga themselves only prepare a man for that state ofspiritual consciousness which transcends thought, which is apart from any of theseeds of thought, which is formless, and which can only be described (and theninadequately) by such terms as unification, realization, identification,nirvanic consciousness, etc.It is useless for the neophyte to attempt to comprehend until he has developedthe internal instrument for comprehension; it is fruitless for the man of theworld to question and seek to be shown unless at the same time he is willing (asin the acquirement of any science) to learn the A.B.C. and graduate in thetechnique.[257]Johnston in his commentary says:“. . . The means of growth previously described were concerned with theextrication of the spiritual man from psychic bondages and veils; while thisthreefold power is to be exercised by the spiritual man thus extricated andstanding on his feet, viewing life with his open eyes.”8. Even these three, however, are external to the true seedless meditation (orsamadhi) which is not based on an object. It is free from the effects of thediscriminative nature of the chitta (or mind stuff).In all the previous stages the thinker has been aware of both himself, theknower, and of the field of knowledge. In the earliest stages he was aware oftriplicity, for the instrument of knowledge was likewise recognised, later to betranscended and forgotten. Now comes the final stage, the object of all yogapractices, where unity is known and even duality is seen to be a limitation.Naught remains but awareness of the self, of that omniscient, omnipotent knowerwho is one with the All, and whose very nature is awareness and energy. As hasbeen well said:“There are therefore these two types of perception: That of living things andthat of the Life; that of the soul’s works and that of the soul itself.”The expounder of yoga is now desirous of describing the results of meditation(some along the line of the higher psychism and some along the line of thelower); the next seven sutras, therefore, [258] deal with the nature of theobjects seen and the control of the mind as the real man seeks to focus theilluminating ray of his mind upon them.In studying these results of meditation in the psychic realm, it should be bornein mind that the eight means of yoga do produce definite effects in the lowernature and that this causes certain unfoldments and experiences to take place;these put the aspirant more consciously en rapport with the interior planes inthe three worlds. This is a safe and necessary process provided it is theoutcome of the awakening of the man on his own plane, and the turning of the eyeof the soul, via the mind and the third eye, upon these planes. The presence ofthe lower psychic power may, however, mean that the soul is (from the physicalplane standpoint) asleep and unable to use its instrument, and that theseexperiences are therefore only the result of the activity of the solar plexusproducing awareness of the astral plane. This type of psychism is a reversion tothe animal state and to the child stage of the human race. It is undesirable anddangerous.9. The sequence of mental states is as follows: the mind reacts to that which isseen; then follows the moment of mind control. Then ensues a moment wherein thechitta (mind stuff) responds to both these factors. Finally these pass away, andthe perceiving consciousness has full sway.If the student will look at any of the translations of the sutras he will findthat this one is [259] variously translated and most of the translations areexceedingly ambiguous. This can be illustrated by giving the translation ofTatya:“Out of the two trains of self-reproductive thought resulting from the Vyutthanaand the Nirodha (respectively), when the former is subdued and the latter ismanifested, and, at the moment of manifestation the internal organ (Chitta) isconcerned in both of the trains, then such modifications of the internal organis the modification in the shape of Nirodha.”The others are still more vague, with the exception of Johnston’s translation.He gives us the following which throws much light upon the thought involved:“Out of the ascending degrees is the development of control. First there is theovercoming of the mind-impress of excitation. Then comes the manifestation ofthe mind-impress of control. Then the perceiving consciousness follows after themoment of control. This is the development of control.”Perhaps the simplest way to understand this thought is to realize that the manin his physical brain is aware of three factors as he attempts to meditate:1. He is aware of the object of his meditation. This excites or impresses hismind, and throws into activity the “modifications of the thinking principle,” orstimulates the tendency of the mind to create thought-forms, and throws thechitta or mind stuff into shapes corresponding to the object seen. [260]2. He then becomes aware of the necessity to subdue this tendency and so bringsin the action of the will and steadies and controls the mind stuff so that itceases to modify itself and take on shape.By dint of steady persevering endeavour the sequential nature of these twostates of consciousness are gradually offset, and in time they becomesimultaneous. Recognition of an object and the immediate control of theresponsive chitta occur like a flash of lightning. This is the state technicallycalled “nirodha.” It must be remembered that (as Vivekananda says):“If there is a modification which impels the mind to rush out through the sensesand the yogi tries to control it, that very control itself will be amodification.”The impress of the will upon the mind will naturally lead to the mind assumingthe shape that controls it and it will be thrown into a modification, dependentlargely upon the point in evolution the aspirant has reached, the trend of hisdaily thought, and the extent of his egoic contact. This is not the true andhighest form of contemplation. It is but one of the earlier stages, but it ismuch higher than concentration and meditation with seed as usually understood,for it is inevitably succeeded by the third stage which is one of greatinterest.3. He then slips suddenly out of the lower state of consciousness and realizeshis identity with the perceiver, with the thinker on his own plane, and becausethe mind is controlled and the [261] object seen excites no response, the trueidentity is able to perceive that which has hitherto been veiled.It should be made clear, however, that the perceiver on his own plane has alwaysbeen aware of that which is now recognized. The difference lies in the fact thatthe instrument, the mind, is now in a state of control, it is therefore possiblefor the thinker to impress the brain, via the controlled mind, with that whichis perceived. Man on the physical plane simultaneously also perceives, and truemeditation and contemplation for the first time become possible. At first thiswill only be for a brief second. A flash of intuitive perception, a moment ofvision and of illumination and all has gone. The mind begins again to modifyitself and is thrown into activity, the vision is lost sight of, the high momenthas passed, and the door into the soul-realm seems suddenly to shut. Butassurance has been gained; a glimpse of reality has been registered on the brainand the guarantee of future achievement is recognized.10. Through the cultivation of this habit of mind there will eventuate asteadiness of spiritual perception.The point of balance between excitation of the mind and control can be achievedwith greater frequency by constant repetition, until the habit of stabilizingthe mind is acquired. When this is accomplished two things occur: [262]1. An instantaneous control of mind at will, producinga. A still mind, free from thought forms,b. A quiescent responsive brain.2. A downflow into the physical brain of the consciousness of the perceiver, thesoul.This becomes increasingly clearer, more informative and less interrupted as timeelapses, until a rhythmic response is set up between the soul and the physicalplane man. The mind and brain are completely subdued by the soul.It should be remembered here that this condition of the mind and brain is apositive one , not a negative state.11. The establishing of this habit, and the restraining of the mind from itsthought-form-making tendency, results eventually in the constant power tocontemplate.Little need be said in explanation of this sutra owing to its clarity. It is inthe nature of a summation of the previous sutras.The idea conveyed is that of the achievement of a constant state of meditation.Though periods in which definite work is done at certain specific and statedhours are of exceeding value, particularly in the early stages of soulunfoldment, yet the ideal condition is that of being in a state of realizationall day every day. The ability at will to draw upon the resources of the ego,the constant recognition that one is a Son of God incarnate [263] upon thephysical plane, and the ability to draw down, when needed, the power and theforce of the soul, is one which will be eventually achieved by every aspirant!But first, however, the habit of recollection has to be instituted and theinstantaneous ability to restrain the modifications of the thinking principlehas to precede this desirable state of being.12. When mind control and the controlling factor are equally balanced, thencomes the condition of one-pointedness.The Sanskrit term used is difficult to explain clearly. Such terms asone-pointed, single in intent, fixed, synthesized, perfected concentration, allgive some idea of the mind condition under consideration.The aspirant is now deliberately unconscious of all states of mind relating tothe three worlds. His attention is focussed upon a specific object, andprimarily upon the reality or subjective life, veiled by the form of the object.He is likewise unconscious of himself, the thinker or knower, and only thatwhich is contemplated is realized in the true sense of the term. This is thenegative aspect.It should be remembered, however, that this is a very active mental state, forthe perceiving consciousness is aware of the object in a most comprehensivemanner. The sum of its qualities, aspects and vibration is revealed to him, aswell as the essential central energy which has called that [264] particularobject into manifestation. This is revealed by the illuminating light of themind being steadily directed upon that object. The perceiving consciousness isalso aware of its identification with the reality behind the form. This is thetrue occult realization, but it is not the realization of the object so much asa realization of unity with, or identification with the life it veils.This is in itself a dual condition but not in the ordinarily accepted sense.There is, however, a still higher state of consciousness when the unity of thelife in all forms is realized, and not simply unity with the life in onespecific object.13. Through this process the aspects of every object are known, theircharacteristics (or form) their symbolic nature, and their specific use intime-conditions (stage of development) are known and realised.It should here be borne in mind that every form of divine manifestation hasthree aspects and hence is made truly in the image of God with all divinepotentialities. In the human kingdom this is recognised. It is equally true ofall forms. This triple nature is grasped by the truly concentrated yogi and thethree are seen as they exist and yet are recognised as constituting one whole.In his commentary, Johnston gives us a picture of the ideas involved, in thefollowing words:“. . . we get a twofold view of this object, seeing at once all its individualcharacteristics, [265] its essential character, species and genus; we see it inrelation to itself and in relation to the Eternal.”In a curious way these three aspects cover the three aspects of the timeequation or of the relationship of the object to its environment.1. Characteristics of the form. In this phrase the tangible outward aspects ofthe form are seen. The matter-side of the manifesting idea is dealt with, andthat which can be contacted through the medium of the senses is first consideredand dismissed. This form is the result of the past, and the limitations due tothe point in evolution are recognised. Every form carries in itself the evidenceof the previous cycles and this can be seen in:a. Its rate of vibration,b. The nature of its rhythm,c. The amount of light which it permits to manifest,d. Its occult colour.2. Symbolic nature. Every object is but the symbol of a reality. The differencein the development of the forms which symbolize or embody that reality is theguarantee that at some future date all the symbols will achieve the fruition oftheir mission. A symbol is an embodied idea, the working out in objectiveexistence of some life. This is the consciousness aspect and two greatrevelations are latent in every symbol or form. [266]a. The revelation of full consciousness, or the streaming forth of that responseto contact which is potential or differing as yet in all forms but which can andwill be carried forward to the full flood-tide of awareness.b. The revelation of that which the consciousness aspect (the second aspect) isin its turn veiling. The unveiling of the soul leads to the manifestation of theone life. The manifestation of the Son of God leads to a knowledge of theFather. The shining forth of the higher self, through the medium of the lowerself, produces the revelation of the divine or spiritual self. The matrix holdsthe diamond and when the matrix reveals its hidden gem, and the work of cuttingand polishing is accomplished, the glory of the jewel will be seen. When thelotus plant has grown to maturity, the flower comes to fruition and in thecentre of its petals the “Jewel in the Lotus” (Om mani padme hum) can be seen.This symbolic aspect of forms is true of all, and whether the symbol is the atomof substance, the mineral, or a tree, an animal or the “form of the Son of God”the jewel of the first aspect will be found hidden. It will make its presenceknown through the quality of consciousness in one or other of its many states.3. Specific use in time conditions . As the yogi one-pointedly concentrates onthe form, or object, meditates on its quality (the subjective aspect or symbolicnature), and contemplates the life veiled by the form but testified to by thefactor of consciousness, he becomes aware of the present stage [267] ofdevelopment, and thus the future, past and present, stand revealed to hisintuition.It will be apparent therefore to even the casual reader, that if meditation inits three above mentioned stages is carried forward correctly, all knowledgebecomes possible to the yogi, the Eternal Now is a realized fact in nature andintelligent cooperation with the evolutionary plan becomes possible. Service isthen based on complete understanding.14. The characteristics of every object are acquired, manifesting or latent.Much the same idea is covered in this sutra as in the previous one. In time andspace all characteristics have relative values. The goal is one; the origin isone, but owing to the differing rates of vibration of the seven great breaths orstreams of divine energy, every life borne forth upon them differs and isdistinctive. The stage of development of the seven Lords of the Rays is notequal. The unfoldment of the life of the various planetary Logoi, or of theseven Spirits before the Throne of God, is not uniform and the atoms in Theirbodies, or the monads who constitute Their vehicles are therefore not uniform inunfoldment.This is a vast subject and cannot be more than touched upon here. Students willfind it of interest to search for information given in the differentpresentations of the one truth anent the great Lives in whom we “live, and moveand have [268] our being.” They can be studied under the following names:1. The seven Rays,2. The seven Spirits before the Throne,3. The seven planetary Logoi,4. The seven great Lords,5. The seven Aeons,6. The seven Emanations,7. The seven Prajapatis,and other less known terms, and much light will be forthcoming.In the characteristic form (taking into consideration its specific point indevelopment, and its lack of development) is revealed to the knower:a. The sum total of acquirement. That which the past has given. This is thetotal chord which the soul of that object is as yet capable of sounding.b. The particular range of qualities out of that total acquisition which thelife is manifesting through any specific form. This is the present note in theacquired chord which the soul of the object has chosen to sound.c. That which is latent and possible. This knowledge will be dual, revealingfirst, the latent possibilities to be unfolded through the medium of the formcontemplated, and secondly, the latent possibilities capable of unfoldment inthe present world cycle through various forms. This covers future developments.This will give the yogi the completed chord when the great evolutionary cyclehas run its course. [269]15. The stage of development is responsible for the various modifications of theversatile psychic nature and of the thinking principle.This is a very general paraphrase of the idea involved and is in the nature of asumming up of the rather abstruse ideas of the text. The sutras following uponthis one deal (for the remainder of Book III) with the results of meditation.The preceding sutras have considered the hindrances and difficulties that haveto be overcome before true meditation becomes possible. The key to thatovercoming and the difference between aspirants to the path is made apparent inthis sutra. The ascertaining of one’s approximate place upon the ladder ofevolution, the summing up of one’s assets and debits is one of the most usefulactivities the would-be aspirant can undertake. An understanding of the stagereached and of the next step to be taken is essential for all true progress.Johnson translates this sutra in the words: “Difference in stage is the cause ofdifference in development,” and goes on to say: “The first stage is the sapling,the caterpillar, the animal. The second stage is the growing tree, thechrysalis, the man. The third is the splendid pine, the butterfly, the angel...”16. Through concentrated meditation upon the triple nature of every form, comesthe revelation of that which has been and of that which will be.The sutra which we are considering sums the [270] preceding ideas and it isinteresting to note how this first great result of meditation takes one rightback to the true facts anent divine manifestation and emphasizes the threeaspects through which every life (from an atom of substance to a solar Logos)expresses itself. The great Law of Cause and Effect and the entire process ofevolutionary unfoldment are recognized and that which is, is seen to be theresult of that which has been. Similarly that which will later eventuate isrecognized to be the working out of causes set in motion in the present, andthus the cycle of development is seen to be one process existing in threestages.These three stages in the three worlds of human unfoldment correspond to thethree dimensions, and students will find it interesting to work out theseanalogies of the various triplicities, remembering that the third aspect(intelligent substance), the Holy Ghost or Brahma aspects, corresponds to thepast (hence a hint as to the nature of evil). The second aspect (consciousness)or the Christ or Vishnu aspect relates to the present, whilst only the futurewill reveal the nature of spirit, the highest or Father aspect. This line ofthought, through concentrated meditation will become clear, and a sense ofproportion and a sense of just values as to the present point in time will grow.A recognition also of the relation of all lives to each other will be developedand the life of the aspirant will be stabilized and adjusted so that past karmawill be adjusted and possible future karma negated and the process of liberationwill proceed with rapidity. [271]17. The Sound (or word), that which it denotes (the object) and the embodiedspiritual essence (or idea) are usually confused in the mind of the perceiver.By concentrated meditation on these three aspects comes an (intuitive)comprehension of the sound uttered by all forms of life.This is one of the most important sutras in the book, and holds the key to theobject of the entire meditation process. This is to reveal or to unveil to theperceiver or spiritual man, the true nature of the self, the second aspect, andthe correspondence to the second aspect in all forms of subhuman life, as wellas to put him en rapport with the second aspect in all superhuman forms. Thus itconcerns the subjective side of all manifestation and deals with those forceswhich in every form constitute the consciousness aspect, which concern theChrist or buddhic principle and which are the direct cause of objectivemanifestation and the revelation of spirit through the medium of form.This is the AUM. First the breath, then the word and all that is, appeared.Just as long as the great Existence who is the sum total of all forms and of allstates of consciousness continues to sound the cosmic AUM, just so long will theobjective tangible solar system persist.The following synonyms in connection with this sutra must be borne in mind ifclarity of thought is to be achieved: [272]I. Spiritual Essence. II. The Sound or Word. III. The Object. 1. Spirit. 1. TheSoul. 1. Body. 2. Pneuma. 2. The Psyche. 2. Form. 3. The Father. Shiva. 3. TheSon. Vishnu. 3. The Holy Spirit. Brahma. 4. The Monad. The One. 4. The cosmicChrist. 4. The vehicle of life and of incarnation. 5. The eternal Will orPurpose. 5. Eternal Love-Wisdom. 5. Eternal activity and intelligence. 6. Onegreat Breath. 6. The AUM. 6. The Worlds. 7. Life. 7. Consciousness Aspect. 7.Activity Aspect. 8. Synthesising Energy. 8. Attractive Force. 8. Matter. 9.First Aspect. 9. Second Aspect. 9. Third Aspect.In the mind of man these three aspects are confused and that which is outwardand objective is usually recognized as reality. This is the great maya orillusion and can only be dissipated when the perceiver can distinguish the threegreat aspects in every form, his own included. When the second aspect, the soul,the middle or mediating principle is known, the nature of the form is alsoknown, and the essential nature of spirit can be inferred. The immediate fieldof knowledge, however, which the yogi has to master is that of the secondaspect. He must arrive at the Sound or Word which brought every form intomanifestation, and which is the result of the breath, the essence or spirit.“In the beginning was the Word and the Word [273] was with God and the Word wasGod. All things were made by Him. . . “ (John I. 1:2.)Here, in the Christian Bible, is the substance of the entire teaching, and inthe significance of the three letters of the Sacred Word, AUM, lies the clue tothe entire cosmic process. The meditation process when duly and correctlycarried out reveals therefore the second or soul aspect, and the Sound, or Word(the Voice of the Silence) can then be heard.Once heard and the work carried steadily forward, the realm of consciousness isrevealed and the yogi is en rapport with the second aspect of his own nature andwith the second aspect in every form. This is the basis of the whole science ofthe soul and leads a man to know his own soul or psyche and the psyche in everyform of divine life. It is the foundation for the entire science of psychism,both in its higher and lower aspects.When a man is a lower psychic he is aware of, and responds to the soul aspect ofthe material forms and the third or Brahma aspect (the body), dominates, forevery atom of matter has a soul. This concerns all that is subhuman.When he responds to the higher correspondence of this, to the reality of whichthe lower is but the shadow, he is in touch with the Christ consciousness, withthe soul of his being which is one with the soul in all the superhuman kingdoms.In connection with this, two things must be remembered. If he is a lower psychiche is in touch with the second aspect of the lower man, the astral body, themiddle principle in the lower [274] man, linking the mental body and theetheric. He is, therefore, en rapport with all that can be contacted on thatplane.If, however, he is a higher psychic he is en rapport with the second aspect ofdivine manifestation, the ego or soul on its own plane, mediating between andlinking the monad with the personality, spirit with the body.It is interesting here to note that a clue to the truth of this can be found inthe manifestations of lower psychism such as are seen in the average mediumisticseance and the ordinary type of spiritualism. Contact with the astral plane ismade through that great centre, the solar plexus which links the higher threecentres and the lower. It accounts also for the fact that flowers are such afeature in materializations at seances, for the vegetable kingdom is the middlekingdom of the three subhuman kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, and animal. Theexplanation as to the prevalence of Indian guides is also found here, for theyare the shells and powerful thought-forms left by the second of the threestrictly human races, Lemurian, Atlantean and Aryan. No Lemurian shells orthought-forms are left now, but many Atlantean shells are still to be foundpreserved through the use of certain forms of Atlantean magic.By concentrated meditation upon the distinction between these aspects there willeventually come a hearing of the Voice of the Silence and contact with a man’sown second aspect. He will know himself as the “Word made flesh” and willrecognize himself as the AUM. [275]When this is the case he will then hear the word in other units of the humanfamily, and will awaken to a recognition of the sound, as it is emanated by allforms in all the kingdoms of nature. The realm of the soul will stand open tohim and this, when it includes recognition of the sound in all the fourkingdoms, will lead him to know himself as Master. Soul knowledge and the powerto work with the soul of all things in the three worlds is the distinctive markof the Adept.18. Knowledge of previous incarnations becomes available when the power to seethought-images is acquired.The significance of this sutra is very great, for it gives the basis for theregaining of a knowledge of past experience. This basis is strictly mental, andonly those mentally polarised and with the mind under control can regain thisknowledge if they so wish. The power to see thought-images only comes throughmind control, and the mind can only be controlled by the real or spiritual man.Therefore only egoically centred people can truly acquire this knowledge. Itmight be asked here what therefore do those people see who are emotional and notmental, when they claim to know who they are, and to relate the past lives oftheir friends? They are reading the akashic records and because their mentalcontrol and equipment are not adequate, they cannot discriminate nor ascertainaccurately what they see.The akashic record is like an immense photographic [276] film, registering allthe desires and earth experiences of our planet. Those who perceive it will seepictured thereon:1. The life experiences of every human being since time began,2. The reactions to experience of the entire animal kingdom,3. The aggregation of the thought-forms of a kamic nature (based on desire) ofevery human unit throughout time. Herein lies the great deception of therecords. Only a trained occultist can distinguish between actual experience andthose astral pictures created by imagination and keen desire.4. The planetary “Dweller on the Threshold” with all that appertains to thatterm and all the aggregations of forms which are to be found in its environment.The trained seer has learnt to dissociate that which pertains to his own auraand the aura of the planet (which is in actuality the akashic record). He candistinguish between those records which are:a. Planetary,b. Hierarchical or pertaining to the work of the twelve Creative Hierarchies asthey bring to concretion the plan of the Logos.c. Imaginative forms, the result of the desire-thought activity of the myriadsof men, animated by desire for some form of experience or other.d. The historical record pertaining to races, nations, groups and families intheir two great divisions on the physical plane and on the astral. [277] Itshould be borne in mind that every human being belongs to a physical familywhich constitutes his link with the animal kingdom, and also belongs to anastral family. Through that affiliation on the upward are he is linked with hisegoic group and on the downward arc with the vegetable kingdom.e. The astrological record, or the forms taken on the astral plane under theinfluence of the planetary forces. These are in two great groups.1. Those forms or pictures in the akasha produced by the inflow of solar forcevia the planets.2. Those forms or pictures which are produced by the inflow of cosmic force fromone or other of the signs of the zodiac, that is, from their correspondingconstellations.These points are enumerated to show how impossible it is that the majority ofthe claims regarding past incarnations can be true. They are the result of avivid imagination and the assumption that the flashes of astral sight whichreveal glimpses of the akashic film give that which pertains to the one whosees. This is not the case any more than the people and activities seen out ofany window in a big city reveal to the onlooker his own relatives, friends andpursuits.The knowledge referred to in the sutra comes in three ways:1. Direct ability to see the records if so desired. This form of acquiringknowledge is seldom employed except by initiates and adepts in connection withtheir pledged disciples. [278]2. Through direct knowledge of the group activities and relations of a man’s ownego. This, however, only covers that cycle of time which began when a manstepped upon the probationary path. Experiences prior to that are relatively ofno more vital importance than is a second in the life of an old man as he passesin retrospect his long life. All that stands out are events and happenings andnot the individual hours and seconds.3. Through the instinctual life. This is based on memory , on acquired facultyand capacity and on the possession of those qualities which go to the equipmentof the ego. The ego knows that the possession of the power to do thus and so inthe three worlds, is the direct result of past experience, and knows too thatcertain effects are only to be achieved through certain causes. These he arrivesat through concentrated meditation.The thought images he becomes aware of are:1. Those in his aura at the time of his meditation,2. Those in his immediate environment,3. Those of his present family, group and race,4. Those of his present life cycle,5. These of his egoic group.Thus through the process of elimination he gradually works his way through gradeafter grade of thought images until he arrives at the particular layer ofthought impression which deals with the cycle about which he is concerninghimself. This is not therefore simply a perception of certain aspects of therecords, but a definitely [279] scientific process, known only to the trainedoccultist.19. Through concentrated meditation, the thought images in the minds of otherpeople become apparent.It should be remembered that the result of the eight means of yoga is to producea yogi or trained knower. He is, therefore, one who concerns himself with causesand not with effects. He perceives that which causes the tangible to appear,that is the thoughts which start into motion the forces of substance andeventually produce the concretion of that substance.The use of this power to read the minds of others is only permitted to the yogiin those cases where it is necessary for him to understand the causes , lyingback of certain events, and this only in order to work out intelligently theplans of the Hierarchy and of evolution. The power here is analogous to that oftelepathy but it is not identical. Telepathy entails the tuning in of one mindwith another, and necessitates their being en rapport. This faculty of thetrained seer is more in the nature of an act of the will and the manipulation ofcertain forces whereby he can instantly see what he wants in any aura at anytime.The subject of his investigation may be attuned to him or not; through intensemeditation and the use of the will faculty thought images stand revealed. Thispower is a dangerous one to use and is only permitted to trained disciples.[280]20. As however the object of those thoughts is not apparent to the perceiver, hesees only the thought and not the object. His meditation excludes the tangible.All that he is “awake” to in his meditation is thought substance, his own chitta(or mind-stuff) and that of others.It is the inherent activity of this chitta which is the cause of the eventualappearing of forms, tangible and objective, on the physical plane.Everything that appears is the result of a subjective happening. All that isexists in the mind of the thinker, not in the sense that is usually understoodbut in the sense that thought sets in motion certain currents of force. Thesecurrents of force gradually sweep into shape forms which correspond to thethinker’s idea and those forms persist as long as the mind of the thinker is onthem and disappear when he “takes his mind off” them.It is the nature of the thought force or current which is perceived throughconcentrated meditation. The form which will be ultimately produced does notinterest the seer. He knows from the cause what the inevitable effect will be.21. By concentrated meditation upon the distinction between form and body, thoseproperties of the body which make it visible to the human eye are negated (orwithdrawn) and the yogi can render himself invisible.This is one of the most difficult of the sutras to the western thinker for itinvolves certain recognitions [281] which are foreign to the occident. Itinvolves primarily the recognition of the etheric or vital body and itsfunctions as the attractive force holding the dense physical vehicle in shape.Through this etheric substratum the physical body is realized as a coherentwhole and its objectivity is observable. This vital body is the true form fromthe standpoint of the occultist and not the dense tangible sheath.The yogi, through concentration and meditation, has acquired the power to centerhis consciousness in the true or spiritual man and to control the thinkingprinciple. It is an occult law that “as a man thinketh, so is he” and it isequally true occultly that “where a man thinketh there is he.” At will thetrained seer can withdraw his consciousness from the physical plane and centerit on the mental. At will he can “shut off the light” and when that is the casevisibility is negated and (from the standpoint of the human eye) he disappears.He also becomes intangible from the point of view of touch, and inaudible fromthe standpoint of hearing. It is this fact that demonstrates the reality of thehypothesis that there is nothing but energy of some form or other, and that thatenergy is triple; in the East they call the nature of energy sattvic, rajasic,or tamasic. That is translated as follows:Sattva rhythm spirit life Rajas mobility soul light Tamas inertia body substanceAll are differentiations in time and space of the one eternal primordialspirit-essence. It may [282] be suggested that the modern westerncorrespondences are to be found in the terms:Energy spirit life Force soul light Matter form substanceThe outstanding characteristic of spirit (or energy) is the life-principle, thatmysterious something which causes all things to be and to persist. Theoutstanding characteristic of the soul (or of force) is light. It brings intovisibility that which exists.The outstanding characteristic of living matter is that it is that which“sub-stands” or is found back of the objective body; and provides the true form.It should be remembered here that the basis of all occult teaching and of allphenomena is to be found in the words:“Matter is the vehicle for the manifestation of soul on this plane of existence;and soul is the vehicle on a higher turn of the spiral for the manifestation ofspirit.” (Secret Doctrine I. 80.)When the soul (or force) withdraws itself out of the matter aspect (the tangibleobjective form), that form is no longer to be seen. It disappears, andtemporarily is dissipated. At present this can be adequately accomplished by theseer through a concentration of his consciousness in the ego, the spiritual manor soul, and (through the use of the thinking principle and an act of the will)his withdrawal of the etheric body from the dense physical. This is covered bythe word “abstraction” and entails: [283]1. A gathering together of the life or vital forces of the body into thephysical plane nerve centres up the spine,2. Their direction up the spine to the head,3. Their concentration there and subsequent abstraction along the thread orsutratma, via the pineal gland and the brahmarandra,4. The seer then stands in his true form, the etheric body, which is invisibleto the human eye. As etheric vision develops in the race this will necessitate afurther abstraction, then the seer will likewise withdraw the vital and luminousprinciples (the qualities of sattva and of rajas) out of the etheric body andstand in his kamic or astral body and thus be also etherically invisible.However, that time is still distant.W. Q. Judge, in his commentary, makes certain interesting remarks, as follows:“Another great difference between this philosophy and modern science is hereindicated. The schools of today lay down the rule that if there is a healthy eyein line with the rays of light reflected from an object—such as a human body—thelatter will be seen, and that no action of the mind of the person looked at caninhibit the functions of the optic nerves and retina of the onlooker. But theancient Hindus held that all things are seen by reason of that differentiationof Satwa—one of the three great qualities composing all things—which ismanifested as luminosity, operating in conjunction with the eye, which is also amanifestation of Satwa in another aspect. The two must conjoin; the absence ofluminosity [284] or its being disconnected from the seer’s eye will cause adisappearance. And as the quality of luminosity is completely under the controlof the ascetic, he can, by the process laid down, check it, and thus cut offfrom the eye of the other an essential element in the seeing of any object.”This entire process is only possible as the result of concentrated and onepointed meditation, and hence is impossible to the man who has not passedthrough the long discipline and training involved in the work of gaining controlof the thinking principle and setting up that direct alignment and functioningwhich is possible when the thinker on his own plane, the mind, and the brain,are all aligned and coordinated via the sutratma, thread or magnetic silvercord.22. Karma (or effects) are of two kinds: immediate karma or future karma. Byperfectly concentrated meditation on these, the yogi knows the term of hisexperience in the three worlds. This knowledge comes also from signs.This sutra can be somewhat elucidated if read in connection with Sutra 18 ofBook III. The karma referred to here deals primarily with the present life ofthe aspirant or seer. He knows that every event in that life is the effect of aprevious cause, initiated by himself in an early incarnation; he knows also thatevery act of the present life must produce an effect (to be worked [285] out inanother life) unless it is done in such a way that:1. The effect is immediate and culminates within the scope of the present lifetime,2. The effect involves no Karma, for the act has been done from a selflessmotive and carried out with complete detachment. He then produces the effectdesired in accordance with the law but it carries no consequences for himself.When the seer enters into incarnation in a life wherein only a few more effectsremain to be worked out, and when all that he initiates is freed from karma,then he can set a term to his life experience and he knows that the day ofliberation is at hand. Through meditation and ability to function as the ego hecan arrive at the world of causes, and he knows therefore what acts must beperformed to release the few remaining effects. Through strict attention to themotive underlying every act of the present life he obviates the necessity fortheir effects to tie him in any way to the wheel of rebirth. Thus he consciouslyand intelligently nears his goal and every deed, act and thought is governed bydirect knowledge, and in no way chains him.The signs or portents referred to, relate primarily to the mental world, wherethe real man dwells. Through an understanding of three things:a. Numbers,b. Colours,c. Vibrations,the seer becomes aware of the freedom of his [286] aura from “death producing”effects. He knows there is nothing more written, symbolically, in the recordswhich can bring him back to the three worlds, and therefore “by signs” his pathis seen to be clear.This has been expressed for us in the ancient writings found in the Masters’archives as follows:“When the star with five points shines with clarity and no forms are seen withinits points, the way is clear.When the triangle encloses naught but light, the path is freed for the passingof the pilgrim.When within the aura of the pilgrim the many forms die out and colours three areseen, then the road is freed from that which might obstruct.When thoughts call not to forms and when no shadows are reflected, the threadprovides a way direct from the circle to the center.”From that point of rest, no return is possible. The term of necessary experiencein the three worlds is at an end. No karma then can draw the freed spirit backto earth for further lessons, or the working out of prior causes. He may,however, continue or resume his work of service in the three worlds, withoutever really leaving his true home in the subtler realms and higher spheres ofconsciousness.23. Union with others is to be gained through one-pointed meditation upon thethree states of feeling—compassion, tenderness and dispassion.Some understanding of this will come if the student will compare this sutra withone in the [287] first book (Sutra 33). The union here dealt with marks a stepfurther than the previous attainment. In that, the nature of the aspirant isbeing trained to harmonious peaceful association with all around him. In this,he is taught to identify himself with all other selves through concentrationupon what are sometimes called the “three states of feeling.” These are:a. Compassion , the antithesis of passion which is selfish and grasping,b. Tenderness , the antithesis of self-centredness, which is always hard andself-absorbed,c. Dispassion , the antithesis of lust or desire.These three states of feeling when understood and entered into, put a man enrapport with the soul of all men.Through compassion, he is no longer occupied with his own selfish interests butenters into and suffers with his brother; he can adapt his vibration so that itresponds to his brother’s need; he is enabled to share in all that is takingplace in his brother’s heart. This he does through the keying up of his ownvibration to respond to the love nature of his own ego, and through thatunifying principle all hearts everywhere are open to him.Through tenderness, that compassionate understanding works out into practicalexpression. His activities are no longer in-going and self-centred but areout-going and inspired by an unselfish heartfelt desire to serve and aid. Thisstate of feeling is sometimes called mercy, and characterizes all the servers ofthe race. It involves active [288] help, unselfish intent, wise judgment andloving activity. It is free from any wish for reward or recognition. This hasbeen beautifully covered by H. P. Blavatsky in The Voice of the Silence in thefollowing words:“Let thy Soul lend its ear to every cry of pain like as the lotus bares itsheart to drink the morning sun.Let not the fierce sun dry one tear of pain before thyself hast wiped it fromthe sufferer’s eye.But let each burning human tear drop on thy heart and there remain; nor everbrush it off until the pain that caused it is removed.These tears, O thou of heart most merciful, these are the streams that irrigatethe fields of charity immortal.”Through dispassion, the aspirant and server stands free from the karmic resultsof his activity on behalf of others. It is, as we know, our own desire whichbinds us to the three worlds and to others. “Binding to” is of a differentnature to “union with.” One is full of desire and causes obligation and effects;the other is free from desire, produces “identification with” and has no bindingeffects in the three worlds. Dispassion has more of a mental quality than theother two. It might be noted that dispassion brings in the quality of lowermind, tenderness is the emotional result of dispassionate compassion andinvolves the kamic or astral principle, whilst compassion concerns also thephysical plane for it is the working out into physical manifestation of the twoother states. It is the practical ability to identify oneself with another inall the three world conditions.This union is the result of the egoic oneness [289] brought down into fullactivity in the three worlds through meditation.24. Meditation, one-pointedly centred upon the power of the elephant, willawaken that force or light.This sutra has given rise to much discussion and its usual interpretation hasgiven the idea that meditation upon the elephant will give the strength of theelephant. Many commentators infer from these words, that meditation upon otheranimals will give their characteristics.It should be remembered that this is a scientific text-book, having for itsobjective the following:1. Training the aspirant so that he can enter into subtler realms.2. Giving him power over the mind, so that it is his instrument to use as hewill as an organ of vision into the higher worlds and as a transmitter orintermediary between the soul and the brain.3. Awakening the light in the head so that the aspirant can become a radiantcentre of light and illumine all problems, and through its light see lighteverywhere.4. Arousing the fires of the body so that the centres become active, luminous,connected and coordinated.5. Producing a coordination between:a. The ego or soul on its own plane,b. The brain via the mind,c. The centres. By an act of the will they can then all be thrown into uniformactivity. [290]6. This effected, the fire at the base of the spine, dormant hitherto, will bearoused and can proceed upward with security, blending ultimately with the fireor light in the head, and so pass out, having “burned out all dross, and leftall channels clear” for the use of the ego.7. Developing thus the powers of the soul; the siddhis, higher and lower, sothat an efficient server of the race is produced.When these seven points are borne in mind, it is interesting to note that thesymbol of the centre at the base of the spine, the muladhara centre, is theelephant. It is the symbol of strength, of concentrated power, of the greatmoving force, which once aroused, carries all before it. It is for our fifthroot race, the symbol of the most powerful and mighty of the animal kingdom. Itis a picture of the transmutation or sublimation of the animal nature, for atthe base of the spine is the elephant and in the head is the thousand petalledlotus hiding Vishnu, seated in the centre. Thus is the animal nature carriedupward into heaven.By meditation upon this “elephant force,” the power of the third aspect, theenergy of matter itself and therefore of God the Holy Ghost or of Brahma, isaroused and conjoined to that of the second or consciousness aspect, to soulenergy, that of Vishnu, the second aspect, the Christ force. This produces theperfect at-one-ment, or union between soul and body, which is the true goal ofRaja Yoga.Will the students of this science remember here, [291] however, that these formsof one-pointed meditation are only permitted after the eight means of yoga(dealt with in Book II) have been followed.25. Perfectly concentrated meditation upon the awakened light will produce theconsciousness of that which is subtle, hidden or remote.Throughout all teachings of an occult or mystical nature reference is foundfrequently to what is called the “Light.” The Bible has many such passages ashave all the Scriptures of the world. Many terms are applied to this but spaceonly permits us to consider those to be found in the various translations of theYoga Sutras of Patanjali. They might be enumerated as follows:a. The awakened inner Light (Johnston),b. The Light in the head (Johnston),c. The Light of immediate cognition (intuitive knowledge) (Tatya),d. That effulgent Light (Vivekananda),e. The Light from the top of the head (Vivekananda),f. The coronal Light (Ganganatha Jha),g. The Light of the luminous disposition (Ganganatha Jha),h. The inner Light (Dvivedi),i. The mind, full of Light (Dvivedi),j. The radiance in the head (Woods),k. The luminosity of the central organ (Rama Prasad),1. The Light of the higher sense-activity (Rama Prasad).From a study of these terms it will be apparent [292] that within the physicalvehicle there is to be found a point of luminosity which (when contacted) willpour the light of the spirit upon the path of the disciple, thus illuminatingthe way, revealing the solution of all problems, and enabling him to stand as alight bearer to others.This light is in the nature of an internal radiance, its position is in thehead, in the neighborhood of the pineal gland, and it is produced by theactivity of the soul.A good deal of discussion has been aroused, by the term “central organ”associated with this light. Some commentators refer this to the heart, others tothe head. Technically neither of them are entirely right, for to the trainedadept the “central organ” is the causal vehicle, the karana sarira , the body ofthe ego, the sheath of the soul. This is the middle of the “three periodicalvehicles” which the divine Son of God discovers and utilizes in the course ofhis long pilgrimage. These find their analogies in the three temples found inthe Christian Bible:1. The transitory ephemeral tabernacle in the wilderness, typical of the soul inphysical incarnation, persisting for one life.2. The more permanent and beautiful temple of Solomon, typical of the soul bodyor causal vehicle, of longer duration and persisting for aeons, and increasinglyrevealed in its beauty upon the Path up to the third initiation.3. The, as yet, unrevealed and inconceivably beautiful, temple of Ezekiel, thesymbol of the sheath of the spirit, the home of the Father, one [293] of the“many mansions,” the “auric egg” of the occultist.In the science of yoga, which has to be wrought out and mastered in the physicalbody the term “central organ” is applied to the head or the heart, and thedistinction is one of time primarily. The heart in the earlier stages ofunfoldment upon the Path is the central organ; later it is the organ in the headwhere the true light has its abiding place.In the process of unfoldment, heart development precedes head development. Theemotional nature and the senses unfold prior to the mind, as can be seen if westudy humanity as a whole. The heart centre opens before the head centre. Lovemust ever be developed before power can be safely used. Therefore the light oflove must be functioning before the light of life can be consciously employed.As the lotus centre of the heart opens and reveals the love of God, throughmeditation a synchronous unfoldment takes place within the head. The twelvepetalled lotus in the head (which is the higher correspondence of the heartcentre, and the intermediary between the twelve petalled egoic lotus on its ownplane and the head centre) awakens. The pineal gland is gradually brought from astate of atrophy to full functioning activity and the centre of consciousness istransferred out of the emotional nature into the illuminated mind consciousness.This marks the transition which the mystic has to make onto the path of theoccultist, keeping, as he always does, his mystical [294] knowledge andawareness but adding to it the intellectual knowledge and conscious power of thetrained occultist and yogi.From the point of power in the head the yogi directs all his affairs andundertakings, throwing upon all events, circumstances and problems the “awakenedinner light.” In this he is guided by the love, insight and wisdom which is histhrough the transmutation of his love nature, the awakening of his heart centreand the transference of the fires of the solar plexus to the heart.It might be asked very pertinently here how this junction between head andheart, producing the luminosity of the central organ and the emission of theinner radiance can be brought about. Briefly stated, it is produced as follows:1. Through the subjugation of the lower nature which transfers the activity ofall the life below the solar plexus and including the solar plexus, into thethree centres above the diaphragm, the head, heart and throat. This is donethrough life, love and service, not through breathing exercise and sitting fordevelopment.2. Through the practice of love, the focussing of the attention upon the heartlife and service, and the realization that the heart centre is the reflection inman of the soul, and that this soul should guide the heart issues from thethrone or the seat between the eyebrows.3. Through a knowledge of meditation. Through meditation, which is theexemplification of the basic yoga aphorism “energy follows thought,” all theunfoldments and developments [295] which the aspirant desires are brought about.Through meditation, the heart centre, which in undeveloped man is pictured as aclosed lotus turned downwards , is reversed, turned upwards and unfolded. At itsheart is the light of love. The radiance of this light, being turned upwards,illumines the path to God, but is not the Path, except in the sense that as wetread upon that which the heart desires (in a lower sense) that path leads us onto the Path itself.Perhaps clarity will come if we realize that part of the path is withinourselves and this the heart reveals. It leads us to the head, where we find thefirst portal of the Path proper and enter upon that part of the path of lifewhich conducts us away from the body-life, to the fullest liberation fromexperience in the flesh and in the three worlds.It is all one path, but the Path of Initiation has to be trodden consciously bythe thinker functioning through the central organ in the head, and from thereintelligently traversing the Path which leads through the three worlds to therealm or kingdom of the soul. It might be stated here that the awakening of theheart centre leads a man to consciousness of the source of the heart centrewithin the head. This in turn leads a man to the twelve-petalled lotus, theegoic centre on the higher levels of the mental plane. The path from the heartcentre to the head, when followed, is the reflection in the body of the buildingof the antaskarana on the mental plane. “As above, so below.” [296]4. Through perfectly concentrated meditation in the head. This carries onautomatically the increased stimulation and awakening of the centres up thespine, five in number, arouses the sixth centre, the one between the eyebrows,and in time reveals to the aspirant, the exit at the top of the head, which canbe seen as a radiant circle of pure white light. This begins as a mere pin pointand passes through various stages of increasing glory and radiant light untilthe Portal itself stands revealed. More along this line is not permissible.This light in the head is the great revealer, the great purifier, and the mediumwhereby the disciple fulfills the command of the Christ, “Let your light shine.”It is the “path of the just which shineth ever more and more until the perfectday.” It is that which produces the halo or circle of light seen around theheads of all the sons of God who have come or are coming into their heritage.Through this light, as Patanjali here points out, we become conscious of thatwhich is subtle, or of those things which can only be known through a conscioususe of our subtle bodies. These subtle bodies are the means whereby we functionupon the inner planes, such as the emotional or astral plane and the mental. Atpresent the majority of us function on these planes unconsciously. Through thislight we also become conscious of that which is hidden or as yet unrevealed. TheMysteries are revealed to the man whose light is shining and he becomes aknower. [297] That which is remote or the future is likewise unfolded to him.26. Through meditation, one-pointedly fixed upon the sun, will come aconsciousness (or knowledge) of the seven worlds.This passage has been commented upon at length by many writers for manycenturies. Simply for the sake of clarity let us modernize the statement andreduce its terms to those of modern occultism.“By constant steady meditation upon the emanating cause of our solar system willcome a realization of the seven states of being.” The various terms used hereserve frequently to confuse the student and it might be wise if we used only twosets of terms, one conveying the orthodox oriental terminology as found in thebest commentaries, and the other the one most easily recognizable by the westerninvestigator. Using Wood’s translation we find the following:[Image00004.jpg]This differentiation of the world into seven [298] great divisions is alsointeresting in so far as it demonstrates the equal accuracy of the fivefolddivision which some of the commentators hold.These seven worlds correspond to the modern occult division of our solar systeminto seven planes embodying seven states of consciousness and enfolding sevengreat types of living beings. The analogy will be seen as follows:1. Physical Plane Bhu Earth world. Physical consciousness. 2. Astral PlaneAntariksa World of the emotions. Kamic or desire consciousness. 3. Mental PlaneMahendra World of the mind and of the soul. Mind consciousness. 4. Buddhic PlaneMahar Prajapatya Christ world. Intuitional or Christ consciousness. Groupconsciousness. 5. Atmic Plane Jana Spiritual world. Planetary consciousness.World of the third aspect. 6. Monadic Plane Tapas Divine world.God-consciousness. World of the second aspect. 7. Logoic Plane Tatya World ofthe emanating cause. Absolute consciousness. World of the first aspect.[299] It is interesting to note certain comments of Vyasa on thisdifferentiation, for they blend in with modern Theosophical thought.The earth plane is described by him as “supported respectively by solid matter,by water, by fire, by wind, by air and by darkness . . . wherein livingcreatures, having been allotted a long and grievous length-of-life, feeling themisery incurred as the result of their own karma, are born.” Comment here isneedless.In connection with the second plane, the astral, reference is made to the factthat the stars (the lives), on that plane are “driven by the wind as cows aredriven by the ploughman in a circle around the threshing floor” and that theyare “regulated by the steady impulsion of the wind.” We have here a wonderfulpicture of how all lives are driven by the force of their desires on the wheelof rebirth.Vyasa notes that the mind world is peopled by six groups of Gods (the six groupsof egos and their six rays, the six subrays of the one synthetic ray, which isapparently inferred). These are the sons of mind, the Agnishvattas (referred toat length in the Secret Doctrine and in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire ) and they areportrayed as:1. Fulfilling their desires, therefore driven by desire to incarnate,2. Endowed with atomisation and other powers, therefore able to create theirvehicles of manifestation,3. Living for a mundane period, therefore in incarnation during a world period,[300]4. Goodly to behold, for the sons of God are luminous, radiant and full ofbeauty,5. Delighting in love, for love is the characteristic of the soul, and all sonsof God, or sons of Mind reveal the love of the Father,6. Possessing bodies of their own “not caused by parents,” that body “not madeby hands, eternal in the heavens” mentioned by St. Paul.In connection with the fourth world, Vyasa notes that it is the world ofmastery, therefore the home of the Masters, and all liberated souls whose “foodis contemplation” and whose lives are “for a thousand mundane periods,”therefore who have immortality.Then he describes the three highest planes, with the great existences who arethe lives of those planes and in whom we “live and move and have our being.”These correspond to the three planes of the Trinity and of these existences intheir various groups, the following comments by Vyasa are illuminating. Hestates:1. “Their lives are chaste,” i.e. , free from impurity, or the limitations ofthe lower forms.2. “Upwards there is no impediment to their thinking and in regions below thereis no object obscure to their thought.” They know all things within the solarsystem.3. “By them no laying down of foundations for a dwelling is made,” thereforethey have no dense bodies.4. “They are grounded in themselves . . . and live as long as there arecreations.” They are the great lives back of all sentient existence. [301]5. They delight in contemplation of varying kinds. Our worlds are but thereflection of God’s thought; and they are the sum total of the mind of God.The ancient commentator sums up by making two basic statements which should benoted by the student. He says:“This whole well-founded configuration stretches out in the midmost part of the(World) Egg. And the Egg is a minute fragment of the primary cause, like afirefly in the sky.”This means that our solar system is but a cosmic atom and is itself only a partof a still greater spheroidal whole. Then he states:“By performing constraint upon the door of the sun, the yogin should directlyperceive all this.” Constraint is a term frequently used in translating phraseswhich mean “the harnessing or restraining of the modifications of the thinkingprinciple;” in other words, perfect one-pointed meditation. By meditation uponthe door of the sun full knowledge can be achieved. This means very briefly thatthrough a knowledge of the sun within one’s own heart and, through the lightemanating from that sun, having found the portal of the path, one enters intorelationship with the sun which is at the heart of our solar system andeventually finds that portal which admits a man to the sevenfold cosmic path. Ofthis no more need be said, as the object of Raja Yoga is to enable a man to findthe light within himself and in that light see light. It enables him also [302]to find the door to life and subsequently to tread the path.Only one more point need be touched upon. Esoterically the sun is regarded astriple:1. The physical sun body intelligent form. 2. The heart of the sun soul love. 3.The central spiritual sun spirit life or power.In man, the microcosm, the correspondences are:1. The personal physical man body intelligent form. 2. The ego or Christ soullove. 3. The monad spirit life or power.27. A knowledge of all lunar forms arises through one-pointed meditation uponthe moon.There are two translations permissible here, the above and the following:“A knowledge of the astral world comes to him who can meditate upon the moon.”Either is correct and probably a true understanding of the Sanskrit is onlyarrived at through combining the two. It might suffice here to give a simpleEnglish paraphrase which will give the essence of the significance of thissutra:“One-pointed concentration upon the mother of forms (the moon) will reveal tothe aspirant the nature and purpose of form.”If the student will remember that the moon is the symbol of matter, whereas thesun in its aspect of light is the symbol of the soul, he will have no difficultyin ascertaining the meaning of the two sutras we have just considered. One dealswith the soul and the various states of consciousness; the other deals with thebody, the [303] vehicle of consciousness. One concerns the body incorruptible,not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. The other deals with the “lunarmansions” (as one translator calls it) and with the home of the soul in thethree worlds of human endeavour.We must be careful however to remember that the moon aspect is the governing onein all the kingdoms below the human, whilst the sun aspect should dominate inthe human.A knowledge of the lunar mansions or of forms would give an understanding of thephysical body, of the astral or desire vehicle and of the mental sheath.28. Concentration upon the Pole-Star will give knowledge of the orbits of theplanets and the stars.This sutra is of small significance to the ordinary student, but is of profounduse to the initiate or pledged disciple. Suffice it here to say that this sutraforms the background for all astrological investigation and from an appreciationof its meaning will eventuate an understanding of:1. The relation of our solar system to the other six constellations which (withours) form the seven force centres of which the seven great spiritual influencesof our system are the reflections and agents.2. The path of our sun in the Heavens and the twelve signs of the Zodiac throughwhich our sun apparently passes. Therefore it will be apparent that this sutrais the key to the purpose of the [304] seven and the twelve upon which all ourcreative processes are built.3. The meaning of the twelve labours of Hercules in their relation to man, themicrocosm.4. The purpose of our planet, gained by the adept through an understanding ofthe triplicity formed by:a. The Pole Star,b. Our Earth Planet,c. The Great Bear.Other meanings are available to those who hold the key, but the above willsuffice to show the deep, though esoteric significance attached to these briefwords.29. By concentrated attention upon the centre called the solar plexus, comesperfected knowledge as to the condition of the body.In the commentary upon Book I Sutra 36, the various centres were enumerated andtheir qualities given. In this section of the book, five of these centres arementioned and they are the five which most closely concern the aspirant, andwhich are the most dominant in the fifth or Aryan race, being awakened but notunfolded in the fourth race. These are:1. The centre at the base of the spine 4 petals, 2. The solar plexus centre 10petals, 3. The heart centre 12 petals, 4. The throat centre 16 petals, 5. Thehead centre 1000 petals.With these five, the aspirant is primarily concerned. The centre called thespleen was dominant [305] in Lemurian days but is now relegated to the domain ofthe fully functioning and therefore automatic centres, and has sunk below thethreshold of consciousness. The centre between the eyebrows is the one throughwhich the light in the head is cast upon things “subtle, obscure, hidden orremote” and is a result of the unfolding of the head and heart.The three major centres are so powerful in the most unevolved person even intheir unopened state that they have produced physical correspondences or glands.Their vibration is such that already in all men they sound , and throughsounding attract and consequently produce a form. In the disciple or initiatethese three centres not only sound but form words ; they therefore command thebuilding of vital forces and take the entire man under control.The glands corresponding to the three centres are:1. The pineal gland and pituitary body Head centre, 2. The thyroid gland Throatcentre, 3. The spleen Heart centre.“Out of the heart are the issues of life”; from it the current of the life bloodcirculates; from its development in the Atlantean race and the consequentcoordination and growth of the astral or emotional body, the heart centre hasbecome the most important in the body. Its activity and development has beenparalleled by the spleen, which is the organ of vitality, of prana or physicalsun force, in the body.[306]There are other glands having a close relation to the various centres but thesubject is too vast to be more than hinted at here. There is not, however, thesame close relation existing between the glands associated with the centresbelow the diaphragm as with those connected with the major centres, situatedabove the diaphragm.In the sutra under consideration we are dealing with one of the five mostimportant centres, and this for the reason that:1. It is situated in the centre of the trunk. It is therefore a correspondenceof the middle principle. In man in Atlantean days the three major centres forthat race were:a. The Head Father or spiritual aspect, b. The Solar Plexus The Son or soulaspect, c. The Base of the Spine The Holy Ghost or matter aspect.The soul was not then so individualized as it is now. The animal soulcontrolled, and consequently full contact with the anima mundi was the dominantfactor. As time elapsed, the soul became more individualized in each humanbeing, and more and more separative, as the mind aspect (the great dividingfactor) dominated. At the close of this race, the three main centres will be thehead, the heart, and the base of the spine. In the sixth race we shall have, thehead, the heart, and the throat.In the final race of the illuminated sons of God, the seventh, we shall have asthe centres through which they work: [307]a. The thousand petalled head center life or spiritual aspect, b. The centrebetween the eyebrows Son or consciousness aspect, c. The throat The Holy Ghostor creative aspect.Through the first, spiritual life will pour in from the monad; through thesecond, the Christ principle, the light of the world, the soul will work,pouring light and life on all things, and using it as the great organ ofawareness. Through the last, the work of creation will be carried on, and thecreative word sent forth.This general view is given so as to present to the student the vision of whatlies ahead. It is, however, of no present value; most aspirants are concernedwith the solar plexus and hence the necessity of our present consideration.2. It is the organ of the astral nature, of the emotions, moods, desires andfeelings and hence is most active in all. It is through it that the lower bodilyfunctions are aroused—desire to eat, to drink, and to procreate, and through itthe lower centres are contacted and work with them is carried forward. In thedisciple, the heart supersedes the solar plexus; in the Master, the head. Allthe centres, however, are the expression of the life and love of God, and intheir totality and perfection express the Christ life.3. It is the centre wherein is carried forward the great work of transmuting allthe lower and animal desires into the higher. Through it literally [308] must bepassed the forces of the lower nature. It gathers up the forces of the bodybelow the diaphragm and directs them upward.4. In the solar plexus, the animal soul becomes merged in the soul of man, andthe Christ consciousness is seen in germ. Taking the analogy of the antenatalstate and the germinating of the Christ in each human being, students who havetheir intuition developed will see the correspondence between the activity ofthe solar plexus and its function, and the first three and one-half months ofthe antenatal period. Then comes what is called the “quickening” and life makesitself felt. A rising up takes place, and the correspondence can then be seenbetween the natural physiological process and the birth of the Christ in thecave of the heart. Herein lies the deep mystery of initiation, and it is onlyrevealed to those who tread the Path of Discipleship to the end.We are told in this sutra that knowledge as to the condition of the body comesthrough meditation upon this centre. The reason is this: when man arrives at anunderstanding of his emotional body and of the force centre through which itfunctions upon the physical plane, he finds that all that he is (physically andetherically) is the result of desire, of kama, and that it is his desires whichchain him upon the wheel of rebirth. Hence the emphasis laid by the yogi uponthat basic discrimination through which a man develops the capacity to choosebetween the real and the unreal and which cultivates in him a just [309] senseof values. Then follows dispassion which, when developed, gives him a distastefor the life of sensuous perception.When the aspirant can grasp the place that desire plays in his life, when herealizes that it is his emotional or astral body which produces the greater partof the trouble in his lower nature, and when he can grasp the technical side ofthe process which desire-energy follows, then the work of the solar plexus isunderstood and he can begin the great dual work of transference andtransmutation. He has to transfer the energy of the centres below the diaphragminto those above, and in the process transmute and change the energy. Thecentres are to be found up the spine, but it aids the student considerably if hecan grasp the idea of the relative localities in the body which are energizedand affected by these centres. All these centres have physical plane organswhich are the result of the response of dense substance to their vibration.The Three Major Centres.1. Head centre brain, pineal gland and pituitary body, 2. Throat larynx, vocalcords and palate, thyroid gland, 3. Heart pericardium, ventricles, auricles withspleen affected.The Four Minor Centres.4. Solar plexus stomach, 5. Spleen spleen, 6. Sacral generative organs, 7. Baseof spine eliminative organs, kidneys, bladder.[310] These physical organs are results or effects; the centres are theirphysical cause and they are produced through the activity of the ethericcentres.These details have been given and the above information collated, owing to theimportance of the solar plexus in this fourth round of the fourth creativeHierarchy (the Hierarchy of human monads or spirits), the fourth centre in manwhether considered upward or downward. One more technical point might here begiven. In the process of transmutation the student should remember that:a. The energy at the base of the spine must go to the head,b. The energy of the sacral centre must go to the throat,c. The energy of the solar plexus must go to the heart. Splenic energy concernssolely the physical body. It goes to all the centres.30-31. By fixing the attention upon the throat centre, the cessation of hungerand thirst will ensue. By fixing the attention upon the tube or nerve below thethroat centre, equilibrium is achieved.It should be remembered that all the sutras which deal with psychic powers arecapable of a lower and a higher interpretation. This is nowhere more apparentthan in this sutra. Through an understanding of the nature of the throat centreand a steady meditation upon it, the yogi can arrest the pangs of hunger and ofthirst and thus [311] do without food indefinitely, whilst through directingenergy to that portion of the great nerve in the throat which lies just belowthe throat centre (found in the well or pit of the throat) he can achieveabsolute immobility and rigidity of the human form. Similarly throughconcentration upon the solar plexus he can become aware in full consciousness ofevery part of his physical body. But these concern the lower siddhis or powersand with these the student of Raja Yoga is not concerned, regarding them as thesecondary effects of soul development. He knows them to be the result of thecorrect following of the eight means of yoga, and therefore automatic andinevitable results. He knows too the danger to the physical organism when theirlower or physical aspect is emphasized.The true significance of the above sutras which are here bracketed together,grows out of an understanding of the transmutative process and the transferencewhich is effected in the solar plexus.The energy of the sacral centre which feeds the generative organs is in duecourse of time transferred into the throat centre. The creative process is thencarried on by thought, sound and the spoken Word. Hunger and thirst are the twoaspects of desire, the one, hunger, being positive, masculine and grasping; theother, thirst, being negative, feminine and receptive. Those two words are butsymbols of the two great impulses underlying the sex impulse. When theseimpulses are dominated and controlled, then the energy of the centre lyingbehind the organs concerned, can [312] be carried upward to the throat, andhunger and thirst are arrested in the esoteric sense. It should be borne in mindhere that these two words are the physical plane analogies to the great pairs ofopposites which the yogi has to balance and which he does balance when the solarplexus is performing its highest function.On the astral or desire plane, within the astral body of the aspirant, must thisbalancing process be wrought out to completion. This is the great battleground,symbolized so beautifully for us in the human body, with its three highercentres, its lower energy focal points and that great middle centre, the solarplexus, typifying the astral plane and its work. It will now be apparent why thetwo sutras are read as one, for they cover one completed work.After achieving some measure of equilibrium, the aspirant learns to perfect thatbalancing process and gains the power to stand firm and immovable, preserving anunshakable equilibrium between the pairs of opposites. The nerve, called“kurma-nadi” or the “tortoise tube” is the physical correspondence to the pointthe aspirant has reached. He stands erect and unshaken before the entrance tothe path; he is at the point in his evolution where he can “escape upward” andfunction in the head.The tortoise has from the earliest ages been the symbol of the slow creativeprocess, and of the long evolutionary road travelled by the spirit. Hence theappropriateness of this term, as applied to what is considered the lowest of thethree major [313] centres, and the one which represents the Creator or Brahmaaspect of divinity, of God, the Holy Ghost, with His function as the energizerof matter or body.32. Those who have attained self-mastery can be seen and contacted throughfocussing the light in the head. This power is developed in one-pointedmeditation.This is a paraphrase of a very general nature, but gives the exact sense of theterms employed. In the twenty-fifth sutra we considered the nature of the lightin the head. Here it might briefly be stated that when the aspirant is aware ofthe light in the head, and can utilize it at will, turning its radiance upon allthat he seeks to know, the time comes when he can not only turn it outward on tothe field of knowledge wherein he functions in the three worlds, but can turn itinward and direct it upward into those realms wherein the saints of God, thegreat “Cloud of Witnesses” walk. He can, therefore, through its medium, becomeaware of the world of the Masters, Adepts and Initiates and thus contact them infull waking consciousness, registering those contacts with his physical brainapparatus.Hence the necessity of becoming aware of one’s own light, of trimming one’s lampand of using the light that is in one, to the full. By use and care, the powerof the spiritual light grows and waxes and develops a dual function.The aspirant becomes a light or lamp set in a [314] dark place and illumines theway for others. Only thus can the light within be fanned to a flame. Thisprocess of lighting others and being a lamp must always precede that wonderfulexperience wherein the mystic turns his lamp and light into other realms andfinds the “way of escape” into those worlds where the Masters work and walk.This point needs emphasis for there is too strong an inclination among studentsto search for the Masters or some Guru or Teacher who will “give” them light.They can only be found by the one who has lit his own light, trimmed his ownlamp and thus provided himself with the means of penetrating into Their world.The more technical side of this matter has been well covered in the words of W.Q. Judge:“There are two inferences here which have nothing to correspond to them inmodern thought. One is, that there is a light in the head; and the other, thatthere are divine beings who may be seen by those who thus concentrate upon the‘light in the head.’ It is held that a certain nerve, or psychic current, calledBrahmarandhra-nadi, passes out through the brain near the top of the head. Inthis there collects more of the luminous principle in nature than elsewhere inthe body and it is called jyotis—the light in the head. And, as every result isto be brought about by the use of appropriate means, the seeing of divine beingscan be accomplished by concentration upon that part of the body more nearlyconnected with them. This point—the end of Brahmarandhra-nadi—is [315] also theplace where the connection is made between man and the solar forces.”It is this light which causes the “face to shine” and is responsible for thehalo depicted around the head of all saints and Masters and which is seen bythose with clairvoyant vision around the head of all advanced aspirants anddisciples.Dvivedi also gives the same teaching in the following words:“The light in the head is explained to be that collective flow of the light ofsattva which is seen at the Brahmarandhra which is variously supposed to besomewhere near the coronal artery, the pineal gland, or over the medullaoblongata. Just as the light of a lamp burning within the four walls of a housepresents a luminous appearance at the keyhole, so even does the light of sattvashow itself at the crown of the head. This light is very familiar to allacquainted even slightly with Yoga practices and is seen even by concentrationon the space between the eyebrows. By Samyama (meditation) on this light theclass of beings called siddhas—popularly known in theosophic circles as Mahatmasor high adepts—able to walk through space unseen, are immediately brought toview, notwithstanding obstacles of space and time.”TWENTY-THREE RESULTS OF MEDITATION33. All things can be known in the vivid light of the intuition.There are three aspects of knowledge associated with the light in the head.First, there is that knowledge which the ordinary [316] man can possess, whichperhaps is best expressed in the word theoretical . It makes a man aware ofcertain hypotheses, possibilities and explanations. It gives to him anunderstanding of ways, means and methods, and enables him to take the first steptowards correct ascertainment and achievement. This is true of that knowledgewhich Patanjali deals with. By acting upon this knowledge and by conforming tothe requirements of the intended investigation or development, the aspirantbecomes aware of the light in the head.Secondly, discriminative knowledge is the next type utilized by the aspirant.The light having been contacted, is used, and the result is that the pairs ofopposites become apparent, duality is known, and the question of choice comesin. The light of God is cast upon either side of the razor edged path theaspirant is endeavouring to tread, and at first this “noble middle” path is notso apparent as that which lies on either side. By the addition of dispassion ornon-attachment to discriminative knowledge, hindrances are worn away, the veilwhich hides the light becomes increasingly thin until eventually the third orhighest light is touched.Thirdly, the “light of the intuition” is one of the terms which can be appliedto this type of illuminative knowledge. It results from the treading of the pathand the overcoming of the pairs of opposites, and is the forerunner of completeillumination and the full light of day. Ganganatha Jha in his brief commentarytouches on all these three. He says: [317]“Intelligence is the emancipator—the forerunner of discriminative knowledge, asthe dawn is of sunrise. On the production of intuitional insight, the yogi comesto know everything.”These flashes of intuition are at first simply vivid flashes of illumination,breaking forth into the mind consciousness and disappearing almostinstantaneously. But they come with increasing frequency as the habit ofmeditation is cultivated and persist for increasingly long periods as stabilityof the mind is achieved. Gradually the light shines forth in a continuous streamuntil the aspirant walks in the full light of day. When the intuition begins tofunction, the aspirant has to learn to utilize it by turning the light which isin him upon all matters “obscure, subtle and remote,” and thus enlarging hishorizon, solving his problems, and increasing his efficiency. What he sees andcontacts through the use of this spiritual light has then to be registered,understood and adapted for use by the man upon the physical plane, through themedium of the brain. Here is where the rational mind plays its part,interpreting, formulating and transmitting to the brain that which the truespiritual man on his own plane knows, sees, and understands. Thus this knowledgebecomes available in full waking consciousness to the incarnated son of God, theman on the physical plane.Another side of this, equally true and necessary, is pictured for us by CharlesJohnston on page 123 of his edition. He says:“This divining power of intuition is the power [318] which lies above and behindthe so-called rational mind; the rational mind formulates a question and lays itbefore the intuition, which gives a real answer, often immediately distorted bythe rational mind, yet always embodying a kernel of truth. It is by thisprocess, through which the rational mind brings questions to the intuition forsolution, that the truths of science are reached, the flashes of discovery andgenius. But this higher power need not work in subordination to the so-calledrational mind, it may act directly, as full illumination, ‘the vision and thefaculty divine.’”34. Understanding of the mind-conscious comes from one-pointed meditation uponthe heart centre.The sons of men are distinguished from the animal kingdom by the possession ofintelligence, of the rational reasoning mind. Hence in the Ageless Wisdom, theSecret Doctrine of the world, human beings are frequently called “sons of mind.”It is this which gives them their sense of individuality, of their separateidentity; it is this which makes them egos.In the centre of the brain, seated in the pineal gland, we are told is the homeof the soul, an outpost of the life of God, a spark of pure spiritual fire. Thisis the lowest point which pure spiritual life, direct from the Monad, our Fatherin Heaven, contacts or reaches. It is the termination of the sutratma, or threadwhich links and connects [319] the various sheaths and passes from the monad onits own high plane, via the soul body on the higher levels of the mental planedown into the physical vehicle. This life of God is triple and combines theenergy of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and is therefore responsiblefor the full functioning of all the parts of man’s nature on all planes, and forall states of consciousness. One strand of this triple thread or path, thefirst, is the giver of life, of spirit, of energy. Another, the second, isresponsible for the consciousness or intelligence aspect, for the power ofspirit to respond to contact and to evolve response. The third concerns the lifeof the matter or body aspect.The first aspect via the monad reaches to the pineal gland—the point wherespirit resides in man. The second or consciousness aspect, via the ego, makes apoint of contact with the heart centre, whilst the third aspect or third part ofthe sutratma links up with the centre at the base of the spine, which is themain source of the personality or bodily activity.Through concentration, therefore, on the light in the head, knowledge of thespiritual worlds and of those pure spirits who work and walk in them isachieved, for Atma or spirit shines there. Similarly through concentratedmeditation upon the heart, knowledge of the second aspect, of the consciousintelligent principle which makes a man a son of God, is gained.Through the development of the head and the use of the head centre, the will isbrought into [320] functioning activity. It is the characteristic of spirit, anddemonstrates purpose and control. Through the unfolding and use of the heartcentre the love-wisdom aspect is similarly brought into use and the love of Godis seen working out in a man’s life and work. For the mind of God is love, andthe love of God is intelligence, and these two aspects of one great quality arebrought into play for the working out of His will and purpose. Of this theChrist was the outstanding example to the Occident, as Krishna was to India, andthis has to be reflected and manifested also in every man.35. Experience (of the pairs of opposites) comes from the inability of the soulto distinguish between the personal self and the purusa (or spirit). Theobjective forms exist for the use (and experience) of the spiritual man. Bymeditation upon this, arises the intuitive perception of the spiritual nature.Again we have quite a loose paraphrase of the original text, but one whichnevertheless conveys the correct interpretation.We have seen in the preceding sutras that the narrow path to be trodden betweenthe pairs of opposites (through the practice of discrimination and dispassion)is the path of equilibrium, of balance, the noble middle path. This sutra is inthe nature of a comment upon this stage of the soul’s experience and points outthe following lessons:[321] First, that the reason we are confronted by the pairs of opposites, and sofrequently choose that line of activity or attitude of mind which produces in uspleasure or pain, is because we fail to distinguish between the lower nature andthe higher, between the personal self (functioning as a physical, an emotional,and a mental unit) and the divine spirit to be found in each of us. We identifyourselves with the form aspect, and not with the spirit. We regard ourselves asthe not-self, for aeons of time and forget our sonship, our unity with thefather and the fact that we are, in reality, the indwelling self.Second, that the purpose of form is simply to enable the self to contact worldsotherwise closed to it, and to develop full awareness in all parts of theFather’s kingdom, and thus demonstrate as a fully conscious son of God. Throughthe form, experience is gained, consciousness awakened, faculty is developed andpowers are unfolded.Third, that as this fact is grasped intellectually and meditated uponinteriorly, awareness of one’s identity with the spiritual nature and one’sdistinction from the form is developed. One knows oneself in truth to be, notthe form but the indweller, not the material self but the spiritual, not thedifferentiated aspects but the One alone, and thus the great process ofliberation is carried forward. One becomes what one is, and one accomplishesthis through meditation on the intelligent soul, the middle aspect, the Christprinciple which links the Father (spirit) and the Mother (matter). [322]Thus the great triplicity is again to be seen:1. The Father, or spirit, the one who manifests, who creates, who indwells,2. The Son who reveals, meditates and links the highest aspect with the lower,3. The Holy Ghost, overshadowing the Mother, intelligent material substanceproviding the forms through which experience and development are gained.The one who experiences, who incarnates and who achieves divine expressionthrough the medium of form is the soul, the self, the spiritual conscious man,the Christ within. When through this experience he has achieved maturity, hereveals the Father or spirit and so fulfills the words of Christ, when He said(in reply to Philip’s question “Lord, show us the Father”), “He that hath seenme hath seen the Father” (John XIV.).36. As the result of this experience and meditation, the higher hearing, touch,sight, taste and smell are developed, producing intuitional knowledge.Through meditation the aspirant becomes aware of the counterparts of the fivesenses as they are found in the subtler realms, and through their awakening andconscious use he becomes able to function as freely on the inner planes as hedoes on the physical. He can then serve intelligently in those realms andcooperate with the great evolutionary scheme.The senses may be defined as those organs [323] whereby man becomes aware of hissurroundings. In the animal these five senses exist, but the thinkingcorrelating faculty is lacking. They demonstrate as group faculty, analogous toa racial instinct in the human kingdom.Each of these five senses has a definite connection with one or other of theseven planes of manifestation, and has also a correspondence on all the planes.Plane Sense 1.

These powers are obstacles to the highest spiritual realisation, but serveas magical powers in the objective worlds.One fact continuously emerges in this text book of spiritual development, andthat is, that the psychic powers, higher and lower, are hindrances to thehighest spiritual state and must be left behind by the man who can functionfreed from the three worlds altogether. This is a hard lesson for the aspirantto grasp. He is apt to think that a tendency towards clairvoyance orclairaudience is indicative of progress and a sign that his practice ofmeditation is beginning to take effect. It might prove just the opposite andinevitably [326] will, should the aspirant be attracted by, or attached to, anyof these forms of psychic faculty. An old Hindu writer says in connection withthese powers:“A mind whose mind stuff is emergent thinks highly of these perfections, just asa man born in misery considers even a small bit of wealth a pile of wealth. Buta yogin whose mind-stuff is concentrated must avoid these perfections, even whenbrought near to him. One who longs for the final goal of life, the absoluteassuagement of the threefold anguish, how could he have any affection for thoseperfections which go counter to the attainment of that goal.”Dvivedi says: “The occult powers described hitherto and to be describedhereafter . . . serve as obstacles because they become the cause of distractingthe mind by the various feelings they excite. But they are not quite uselessinasmuch as they are great powers for good in moments when samadhi issuspended.”It is of value to the aspirant to know what these powers are, how to controlthem and not be controlled by them, and how to use them in the service of hisbrother and of the Hierarchy, but they must be regarded as instruments and berelegated to the form side. It must be realised that they are the qualities orcapacities of the sheaths or the form aspect, otherwise they will assume undueimportance, engross undue attention and prove stumbling blocks to the progressof soul unfoldment. [327]38. By liberation from the causes of bondage through their weakening, and by anunderstanding of the mode of transference (withdrawal or entrance), the mindstuff (or chitta) can enter another body.This entire science of Raja Yoga is based upon an understanding of the nature,purpose and function of the mind. The basic law of this science can be summed upin the words “energy follows thought” and the sequence of activity might bestated as follows:The thinker on his own plane formulates a thought embodying some purpose or somedesire. The mind vibrates in response to this idea and simultaneously produces acorresponding reaction in the kamic, desire or emotional body. The energy body,the etheric sheath vibrates synchronously, and thereby the brain responds andenergises the nerve-system throughout the dense physical body, so that theimpulse of the thinker works out into physical plane activity.There is a close connection between the mind and the nervous system so that wehave an interesting triplicity,1. The mind,2. The brain,3. Nervous system,and this triplicity must be carefully borne in mind by the student of Raja Yogain the initial stage of his work. Later a second triplicity will engross hisattention, [328]1. The thinker,2. The mind,3. The brain,but this will be during the demonstration side of his work.It is through an understanding of the method of energising the nerves that thethinker can galvanise its instrument into activity during incarnation, andsimilarly produce trance, samadhi, or death. The same basic knowledge enablesthe adept to raise a dead body, as Christ did in Palestine, or occupy thevehicle of a disciple for purposes of service, as Christ occupied the body ofthe disciple Jesus. This knowledge and its use, we are told, is subject to thegreat law of karma, of cause and effect, and even the Christ Himself may not setthe law aside in any case unless there is adequate “weakening” of the causeproducing the bondage.39. By subjugation of the upward life (the udana) there is liberation fromwater, the thorny path, and mire, and the power of ascension is gained.Pervading the whole body is that sum total of nervous force, called by theHindu, prana. It is controlled by the mind via the brain; it is the vitalitywhich brings into activity the sense-organs and produces the outward-going lifeof the man; its medium of distribution is the nervous system through certaingreat distributing centres called plexi, or lotuses. The nerve ganglia known[329] to orthodox medicine, are the reflections or shadows of the more vitalplexi. The student will not go far astray if he regards the sum total of pranain the human body as constituting the vital or etheric body. This etheric bodyis formed entirely of energy currents, and is the substratum of living substancewhich underlies the dense physical form.One term applied to this energy is the “vital airs.” Prana is fivefold in itsmanifestation, thus corresponding to the five states of mind, the fifthprinciple and to the five modifications of the thinking principle. Prana in thesolar system works out as the five great states of energy which we call planes ,the medium of consciousness; these are:1. The atmic or spiritual plane,2. The buddhic or intuitional plane,3. The mental plane,4. The emotional, astral or kamic plane,5. The physical plane.The five differentiations of prana in the human body are:1. Prana , extending from the nose to the heart and having special relation tothe mouth and speech, the heart and lungs.2. Samana extends from the heart to the solar plexus; it concerns food and thenourishing of the body through the medium of food and drink and has a specialrelation to the stomach.3. Apana controls from the solar plexus to the soles of the feet; it concernsthe organs of elimination, of rejection and of birth, thus having special [330]relation to the organs of generation and of elimination.4. Upana is found between the nose and the top of the head; it has a specialrelation to the brain, the nose and the eyes, and when properly controlledproduces the coordination of the vital airs and their correct handling.5. Vyana is the term applied to the sum total of pranic energy as it isdistributed evenly throughout the entire body. Its instruments are the thousandsof nadis or nerves found in the body, and it has a peculiar definite connectionwith the blood channels, the veins and arteries.In this sutra we are told that by mastery of the fourth of these vital airs,certain definite results can be achieved and it will be interesting to note whatthey are. This mastery only becomes possible as the Raja Yoga system isunderstood and mastered, for it involves the capacity to function in the headand to control the entire nature from the point within the brain. When a manbecomes polarised there, then the nervous force or energy found in the top ofthe head becomes active and through its correct control and through mastery ofit, the right direction of the pranas of the body becomes possible and manreaches liberation; through it, noncontact in the three worlds is brought about.The language used is necessarily symbolic and its meaning must not be lostthrough a materializing of its real significance. Levitation, the power to walkon water, and ability to withstand the gravitational pull of the earth is itslowest and least important significance. [331]1. Freedom from water is a symbolic way of stating that the astral nature issubjugated and the great waters of illusion can no longer hold the emancipatedsoul. The energies of the solar plexus no longer dominate.2. Liberation from the thorny path refers to the path of physical life, and isnowhere more beautifully referred to than by the Christ in His parable of theSowers, where some of the seed fell among thorns. The explanation is given thatthe thorns are the cares and troubles of worldly existence which succeed inchoking the spiritual life and in veiling the true man for so long. The thornypath must lead to the northern path and that in turn to the Path of Initiation.In one of the old books in the Archives of the Lodge, are found these words:“Let the seeker after truth escape from drowning and climb the river’s bank. Lethim turn towards the northern star and on firm ground stand, his face directedtowards the light. Then let the star lead.”3. Liberation from the mire refers to that mixed nature of kama-manas, desireand lower mind, which causes the unique problem of humanity. It is a symbolicway also of referring to the great illusion which snares the pilgrim for solong. When the aspirant can walk in the light, having found the light (theShekinah) within himself in the Holy of Holies, then the illusion is dissipated.It is of value to the student to trace the analogy between the three parts ofSolomon’s Temple, and that of the “Temple of the Holy Spirit,” the human frame.[332]The outer court corresponds to those energies and their corresponding organsfound below the diaphragm. The Holy Place is the centres and organs in the upperpart of the body from the throat to the diaphragm. The Holy of Holies is thehead where is the throne of God, the Mercy Seat, and the overshadowing glory.When these three aspects of freedom have been gained and the man is no longerdominated by the water, the mire or physical plane life, then “the power ofascension” is gained and he can ascend into heaven at will. The Christ orspiritual man can stand upon the mountain of ascension, having passed throughthe four crises or points of control from the birth to the crucifixion. Thus the“udana” or upward life becomes the controlling factor and the downward life nolonger dominates.40. Through subjugation of the samana, the spark becomes the flame.This sutra is one of the most beautiful in the book and the translation byCharles Johnston should here be noted: “By mastery of the binding life comesradiance.” Another interpretation might be “through control of samana the AUM(the Word of Glory) manifests.” Out of the heart are the issues of life, and thevital energy called samana controls the heart and the life breath through thelungs. When the body is purified and its energies rightly directed, and whenrhythm is achieved, then a radiant life is seen.[333] This will work out literally and not simply metaphorically, for when thelife currents are directed by the soul upon the throne, through the nerves andthe blood channels, then only the purest atoms will be built into the body andthe result will be a shining forth of light through the entire man. Not onlywill the head be radiating light so that the clairvoyant will see a halo orcircle of brilliant colors, but all the body will be irradiated by the vibrantcentres of electrical force distributed throughout the body.41. By the means of one-pointed meditation upon the relationship between theakasha and sound, an organ for spiritual hearing will be developed.To understand this sutra, it is essential that certain relationships arecomprehended—relationships between matter, the senses and the one whoexperiences.The Christian believes that “all things were made by the word of God.” Theoriental believer holds that sound was the originating factor in the creativeprocess and both teach that this word or sound is descriptive of the secondPerson of the divine Trinity.This sound or word threw into peculiar activity the matter of the solar system,and was preceded by the breath of the Father which started the original motionor vibration.First, therefore, the breath (pneuma or spirit) impinging upon primordialsubstance and setting up a pulsation, a vibration, a rhythm. Then the [334] wordor sound, causing the pulsating vibrating substance to take form or shape, andthus bringing about the incarnation of the second Person of the cosmic Trinity,the Son of God, the Macrocosm.This process eventuated in the seven planes of manifestation, the sphereswherein seven states of consciousness are possible. All of these arecharacterized by certain qualities and differentiated from each other byspecific vibrating capacities and called by certain terms.The following tabulation may prove useful if the student will bear in mind thatthe first triplicity of planes are those of divine manifestation and the lowertriplicity constitute the reflection of that divine process and are the threeplanes of our normal experience. These two triplicities of God and man areconnected by the middle plane of at-one-ment or union whereon God and man aremade one. This is the Christ plane in Christian phraseology, the buddhic planein the eastern terminology.THE DIVINE PLANES.Plane I. Logoic or divine The Sea of Fire God the Father Will. Plane II. MonadicThe Akasha God the Son Love-Wisdom. Plane lII. Spiritual or atmic The Æther Godthe Holy Ghost. Active Intelligence.[335]THE PLANE OF UNION OR ATONEMENT.Plane IV.

Buddhic Touch Air. III. Atmic Hearing Æther. II. Monadic MindAkasha. I. Logoic Synthesis.It will be apparent, however, that one gives the microcosmic standpoint, theother gives the macrocosmic, and as the aspirant is one who seeks to function as“free in the macrocosm” and to transcend his microcosmic limitations, it is thefirst category with which we will concern ourselves.In considering this sutra and its clarification by an understanding of thenature of the planes, their symbols and substance, it becomes apparent that theman who understands the nature of the word and of the second aspect, arrives atthe realization of hearing.This might also be grasped mystically by the aspirant when he realizes that whenthe voices of desire (astral voices or vibratory response to the second aspectof the reflection, the three lower planes) are superseded by the Voice of theSilence or of the Christ within, then the word or sound is known and the secondaspect of divinity is contacted.1. The Akasha The word The sound The second aspect in manifestation. 2. TheAstral Light The voices of desire The reflection of the second aspect.[337] There are many sounds to be heard on all the planes but on the physical isthe greatest diversity. The aspirant has to develop the power to distinguishbetween:1. The voices of earth physical, 2. The voices of desire astral, 3. The speechor formulated thoughts of the mind mental, 4. The still small voice of theChrist within buddhic, 5. The sounds of the Gods The creative words atmic, 6.The word or sound The AUM monadic, 7. The breath logoic,and in these distinctions are symbolically conveyed the problem of correcthearing on the various planes and in the various states of consciousness. Onlythe true mystic and aspirant will comprehend the nature of these distinctions.Just as all the substances of our manifested solar system are differentiationsof the akasha, the first differentiation of the primordial stuff, so all thesedistinctions of sound are differentiations of the one sound; all are divine intime and space. But all have to be heard correctly and all lead eventually toand form in their totality the AUM, the Word of Glory, the Macrocosmic Word.With the student of Raja Yoga, however, there are three main voices or soundswith which he is temporarily concerned:1. The speech of the Earth, so as to rightly use it,2. The Voice of the Silence, so as to hear it. This is the voice of his owninner God, the Christ, [338]3. The AUM, the Word of the Father, expressed through the Son, which will, whenheard, put him in touch with the Word of God, incarnate in all nature.When speech is rightly used and the sounds of earth can likewise be stilled,then the Voice of the Silence can be heard. It might be noted here thatclairaudience is awareness of the voice of the great illusion and gives a manpower to hear on the astral plane. This in its right place and when controlledfrom above through knowledge, opens the ear to certain aspects of divineexpression in the three worlds. It is not the divine hearing referred to in thesutra. In Charles Johnston’s comments on this sutra, he covers the groundbeautifully as follows: “The transfer of a word by telepathy is the simplest andearliest form of the ‘divine hearing’ of the spiritual man, as that power grows,and as, through perfectly concentrated meditation, the spiritual man comes intomore complete mastery of it, he grows able to hear and clearly distinguish thespeech of the great Companions, who counsel and comfort him on his way. They mayspeak to him either in wordless thoughts, or in perfectly definite words andsentences.”42. By one-pointed meditation upon the relationship existing between the bodyand the akasha, ascension out of matter (the three worlds) and power to travelin space is gained.The akasha is everywhere. In it we live and move and have our being. All is butone substance, [339] and in the human body are found the correspondences to thevarious differentiations.When a man knows himself, and is aware of the relationship existing between theenergies working through the seven centres and the seven states of matter andconsciousness, then he is liberated and free and can contact at will and withouttime limitations all those states. There is a relation between one of the sevenstates of matter and one or other of the centres; through each one of thecentres is the door to a certain plane of the planetary spheres. When thedisciple has worked out into his life in correct realization the various meansof yoga dealt with in the previous books, certain keys and knowledge, certainwords and formulas, can be entrusted to him which will, through concentratedmeditation give him the freedom of the heavens and the right to pass throughcertain gateways into the Kingdom of God.43. When that which veils the light is done away with, then comes the state ofbeing called discarnate (or disembodied), freed from the modification of thethinking principle. This is the state of illumination.Again, we have a free, rather than a literal translation, and in this the truesense of the archaic terms used is preserved instead of academic correctness.The reason for this will be apparent if certain well-known translations aregiven. They are correct translations but demonstrate [340] the ambiguity whichis inevitable when a literal translation of the Sanskrit terms is used.“An outwardly unadjusted fluctuation is the great Discarnate; as a result ofthis the dwindling of the covering to the brightness.” Woods.“The external modification (of the internal organ) . . . thoughtless is (called)the great incorporeal (modification); therefrom (results) the destruction of theobscuration of the illumination (of intellect).” Tatya.Vivekananda expresses the sutra in the following terms:“By making sanyama on the real modifications of the mind, which are outside,called great disembodiedness, comes disappearance of the covering of light.”The great difficulties under which all translators labour is apparent from thisand hence the frank paraphrasing of this passage.There are two thoughts seeking expression in this sutra. One refers to the veilor covering which prevents the illumination of the mind, and the other to thestate of realization which is achieved when a man has freed himself from thisveil. That which covers up the light (the “bushel” referred to by the Christ inthe New Testament) is the changing, fluctuating sheaths or bodies. When they aretransmuted and transcended the light of God (the second divine aspect) can floodthe lower man and he knows himself as he is. Illumination pours in and he knowshimself as something different to the forms through which he is functioning. Heis no longer centred, no [341] longer polarized in his forms, but is actually ina condition of disembodiedness. His consciousness is that of the man out ofincarnation, of the true man on his own plane, the real discarnate thinker. St.Paul, as has been pointed out by several thinkers, had a touch of this state ofbeing. He referred to it in these words:“I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I cannottell, or whether out of the body I cannot tell; God knoweth); such an one caughtup to the third heaven. And I knew such a man . . . how that he was caught upinto paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man toutter.” (II Cor. XII)This “third heaven” can be understood in two ways: first, as standing for themental plane on which is the true home of the spiritual man, the thinker, or amore specific state to be understood as that found on the third or highest ofthe three abstract levels of the mental plane.44. One-pointed meditation upon the five forms which every element takes,produces mastery over every element. These five forms are the gross nature, theelemental form, the quality, the pervasiveness and the basic purpose.It should be remembered that this will have a dual reference, to the macrocosmand to the microcosm. It can refer to the five planes of monadic evolution, orto the five forms which every element [342] takes on each and every plane,bearing in mind that this is the case as regards the mind apprehension and themodifications of the thinking principle, for mind is the fifth principle, andman is the five pointed star and therefore can (as man) achieve only a fivefoldillumination. There are, however, two higher forms and two other modes ofperception, i. e. , the intuitional and spiritual realization. With these,however, the present sutra has not to do. The head centre is dual in itself andis composed of the centre between the eyebrows and the highest chakra, thethousand petalled lotus.The study and understanding of this sutra would result in the complete equippingof the white occultist for all forms of magical work. Students must rememberthat this does not refer to the elements as we have them, but has relation tothe elemental substance out of which all gross forms are made. According to theAgeless Wisdom there are five grades of substance having certain qualities.These five grades of substance form the five planes of monadic evolution; theycompose the five vibratory spheres in which man and superhuman man are found.These five planes have each an outstanding quality, of which the five physicalsenses are the correspondence.Plane Nature Sense Centre Earth Physical Smell Base of spine Astral EmotionalTaste Solar Plexus Manasic Mental Sight Head Buddhic Intuitional Touch HeartAtmic Spiritual Sound Throat[343] As pointed out in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , these senses and theircorrespondences are dependent upon the point in evolution of the man, just as H.P. Blavatsky stated in connection with the enumeration of the principles.The above sutra therefore can be applied to the mastery of each plane as well asto the mastery of elements composing that plane. It has reference to the masteryand utilization of all the subtler sheaths through which a man contacts a planeor peculiar rate of vibration.Ganganatha Jha in his able commentary says: “The specific qualities, sound andthe rest belonging to the earth, together with the properties of shape and therest, are named ‘gross.’ This is the first form of the elements. The second formis their respective generic characteristic: Shape for the earth, viscidity forthe water, heat for fire, velocity for air and omnipresence for the akasa. Thespecific forms for these generic ones are sound and the rest.” He gives atranslation of this forty-fourth sutra which is analogous to all the others withthe exception of Johnston’s, and which runs as follows:“Mastery over the elements, from the sanyama with the reference to grossness,character, subtlety, concomitance and usefulness.”1. Grossness, gross nature.Sound and the other senses as they show forth on the physical plane. We mustbear in mind that this plane is the gross summation of all the others. Spirit ismatter at its lowest point.2. Character, elemental form. [344]The nature of the specific characteristics of the elements.3. Subtlety, or quality.The basic atomic substance of any one element. That which produces itsphenomenal effect. It is that which lies back of all sense perception, and ofall the five senses. Another word for this “subtle” form is tanmatra.4. Concomitance, or pervasiveness.This is the all-pervasive nature of every element; its inherence. It is the sumtotal of the three gunas, tamas, rajas and sattva. Every element according toits place in the manifested scheme is characterised by inertia, activity orrhythm. It is inherent in substance. Only the rate of vibration differs. Thereis the correspondence to every element on every plane.5. Usefulness, or basic purpose.This is the right use of every element in the great work of evolution. It isliterally the power hidden in every atom of substance which drives it on(through all the kingdoms of Nature) to self expression, and enables it toperform its work in time and space and to proceed towards eventual fruition.When, through concentrated meditation upon the five distinctive forms of all theelements, the knower has arrived at a knowledge of all their qualities,characteristics and nature, he can then cooperate intelligently in the plan andbecome a white magician. For the majority it is as yet only possible for us toarrive at three of the forms, and this is touched upon in Light on the Path in[345] the words: “Inquire of the earth, the air and the water, of the secretsthey hold for you. The development of your inner sense will enable you to dothis.”45. Through this mastery, minuteness and the other siddhis (or powers) areattained, likewise bodily perfection and freedom from all hindrances.Towards the close of each of these three books on Raja Yoga, there comes a sutrasumming up results and giving a vision of that which is possible to the faithfulintelligent aspirant. They are as follows:“Thus his realization extends from the infinitely small to the infinitely great,and from annu (the atom or speck) to atma (or spirit) his knowledge isperfected.” (Book I. Sutra 40.)“As a result of these means there follows the complete subjugation of the senseorgans.” (Book II. Sutra 55.)“Through this mastery minuteness and the other siddhis (or powers) are attained,likewise bodily perfection and freedom from all hindrances.” (Book III. Sutra45.)It will be seen from this how, first there is the attaining of the vision andthe inner realization of God; then the complete subjugation of the lower natureand the control of the senses and their organs so that the realization becomesfact in physical plane experience, and there comes the manifestation of thatcontrol by the display of certain powers.[346] The entire fourth book deals with the great consummation growing out ofthe three above results, producing:1. Cessation of sorrow and toil. (Sutra 30.)2. Attainment of infinite knowledge. (Sutra 31.)3. Eternity entered. (Sutra 33.)4. Return of consciousness to its centre. (Sutra 34.)In connection with the sutra which is our present consideration, the eightsiddhis or psychic powers are frequently called the eight perfections and withthe two others make up the ten of perfection as it concerns the lower man. Thesepowers are:1. Minuteness . . . anima . This is the power which the yogi possesses to becomeas small as an atom, to identify himself with the smallest part of the universe,knowing the self in that atom to be one with himself. This is due to the factthat the anima mundi, or soul of the world, is universally spread throughout allaspects of divine life.2. Magnitude . . . mahima . This is the power to expand one’s consciousness andthus enter into the greater whole as well as into the lesser part.3. Gravity . . . garima . This concerns weight and mass and deals with the lawof gravity which is an aspect of the Law of Attraction.4. Lightness . . . Laghima . This is the power underlying the phenomenon oflevitation. It is the capacity of the adept to offset the attractive [347] forceof the planet and to leave the earth. It is the opposite to the third siddhi.5. The attainment of the objective . . . prapti. This is the capacity of theyogin to achieve his goal, to extend his realization to any locality, to reachanything or any place he desires. It will be apparent that this will have anapplication on all the planes in the three worlds, as indeed all the siddhishave.6. Irresistible will . . . prakamya. This is sometimes described as sovereignty,and it is that driving irresistible force found in every adept which bring aboutthe fruition of his plans, the attainment of his desires, and the completion ofhis impulses. It is this quality which is the distinguishing characteristic ofthe black and the white magician alike. It necessarily demonstrates withgreatest force on that plane in the three worlds which reflects the will aspectof divinity, the mental plane. All the elements obey this force of will as usedby the yogin.7. Creative power . . . isatva. This concerns the power of the adept to dealwith the elements in their five forms and produce with them objective realities,and thus to create on the physical plane.8. The power to command . . . vasitva . The magician as he controls theelemental forces of nature, utilizes this power and it is the basis of mantrayoga, the yoga of sound or of the creative word. Creative power, the seventhsiddhi, concerns the elements and their vitalizing, so that they become“effective causes;” this siddhi, the [348] eighth, concerns the power of theWord to drive the building forces of nature into coherent activity so that formsare produced.When these eight powers are functioning, then the ninth, bodily perfection,results, for the adept can construct a vehicle adapted to his need, can do withit as he will and through its medium attain his objective. Finally, the tenthpower will be seen in full manifestation and no form provides any hindrances orobstacles to the fruition of the yogin’s will. He is liberated from the form andits qualities.46. Symmetry of form, beauty of colour, strength and the compactness of thediamond, constitute bodily perfection.Though many commentators, give to this sutra a purely physical interpretation, amuch wider concept is involved. In it we have pictured for us in carefullychosen terms (of which the English is but a paraphrase, lacking the expressionfully to convey the idea) the condition of the third or form aspect throughwhich the second or Christ aspect is manifesting. This third aspect is itselftriple, yet forms one coherent whole and hence the use of four terms to expressthis lower personal self. The occultist never concerns himself with the densephysical vehicle. He considers the etheric body to be the true form and thedense as simply the material used to fill in the form. The etheric body is thetrue substantial form, the framework, the scaffolding, to which the dense [349]body necessarily conforms. This form must be symmetrical, or built trulyaccording to number and design, and its basic distinction will be thegeometrical exactness of its many units. The emotional or astral body is, as iswell known, distinguished by its colourfulness, and according to the stage ofunfoldment so will the colours be beautiful, clear and translucent, or ugly,dark and cloudy. The astral body of the adept is a thing of radiant loveliness,lacking all the colours of low vibration. Then the highest aspect of thepersonal self, the mental body will vibrate to the highest aspect of the spirit,which is will, power or strength—any of these words suffice. Strength, beautyand form, the reflections of power, love and activity, these are thecharacteristics of the body of manifestation of any son of God who has enteredinto his kingdom. Then the fourth expression conveys the idea of the unity, thecoherence of the three, so that they function as a whole and not independentlyand separately. Man is thus the Three in One and the One in Three, as is hisFather in Heaven, being “made in the image of God.”Two words are used by translators to convey this idea of compact cohering force,i.e. , the diamond, and the thunderbolt. The human being who has taken thehighest of all our planetary initiations is termed “the diamond-souled”—the manwho can perfectly transmit the pure white light and yet reflect equally all thecolours of the rainbow, the seven colours of the chromatic scale. Hispersonality is here called by the same term [350] for it has become atransmitter of the inner light or radiance.The term “thunderbolt” is equally expressive, conveying as it does the idea ofelectrical force. All that we can know of God or of man is the quality of hisenergy as it demonstrates in force and activity, hence in the Secret Doctrine ,the highest aspect of divinity is called electric fire.47. Mastery over the senses is brought about through concentrated meditationupon their nature, peculiar attributes, egoism, pervasiveness and usefulpurpose.Sutra 44, dealt very largely with objectivity and the nature of the five formswhich every element assumes. This sutra concerns itself with that which issubjective, and with the subtle apparatus through which forms are contacted andlikewise turned to specific purposes. We are dealing here with the indriyas, orsenses, which are usually divided by Hindu philosophers into ten instead offive. They divide the five senses into two groups, those which we call theorgans of sense, such as the eye, the nose, etc., and then the faculty whichmakes it possible for the eye to see and the nose to smell.In considering the senses, the student studies them, therefore, in fiveconnections and this likewise in relation to their counterparts on the astraland mental planes. The five divisions are as follows:1. Their nature. He studies each sense in its twofold condition, that of theexternal instrument [351] and the internal capacity of that instrument torespond to certain vibratory impacts. He knows why, for instance, the organ ofsense called the eye vibrates to those impacts which produce the condition ofsight, but fails to respond to those impacts which cause scent or smell. Hediscriminates therefore between the senses and learns thereby to follow avibratory impulse back to its source along one or other of the five possiblelines of approach, and this he does intelligently and not simply blindly.2. Their peculiar attributes. He studies then the quality of the senses, layingthe emphasis not so much upon the particular sense concerned (this is coveredabove) as upon the peculiar attribute of the sense and of that to which it givesthe key in the macrocosm.3. Egoism , refers to the “I” making faculty which so predominantlydistinguishes the human being and thus brings in the sixth sense, the mind, asthe interpreter and synthesizer of the other five. It is the capacity of thehuman being to say “I see,” “I smell,”—a thing the animal cannot do.4. Pervasiveness . All the senses are capable of infinite extension and everysense when consciously followed and utilized can lead a man in three maindirections:a. To the centre of all things, back to the heart of God,b. Into close communication with his fellow man, putting him en rapport withhim, when so desired,c. Into touch with all forms. [352]To the average man there is only that which he can hear, touch, see, taste andsmell, only five ways in which he can know. There are only five responsespossible to him as he contacts vibration of any kind and in our solar systemthere is naught else but vibrating energy, God in active motion. These fivemethods put him en rapport with the five elements and when this is realized, theinfinite possibilities open to the aspirant, begin to appear. Later to theadvanced man another and higher range of vibration opens up when he can use themind itself, not only as the unifier of all the five senses but as a sixth sensealso. This is the object of all Raja Yoga practice. Through the mind, the soulrealm is cognized, just as through the senses the objective world was contacted.5. Useful purpose . When the relation of the five senses to the five elements isunderstood, and the Law of Vibration is studied and mastered, the adept can thenturn to useful purposes all the powers of his nature. He not only can enter intocommunication with all parts of our planetary system but can also usediscriminatingly and wisely all those parts of his own nature which are alliedto, or correspondences of the nature of God as shown in the macrocosm.48. As a result of this perfection, there comes rapidity of action like that ofmind, perception independent of the organs, and mastery over root substance.We have been considering the many results of [353] the meditation process whencarried forward to perfection and we are now reaching a climax. The seer hasachieved the consummation of the alignment process. His triple personal self hasbeen purified, adjusted and controlled. Each of the three bodies is vibrating intune with the note of the ego or higher self, which in turn is in process ofsynchronizing with the Monad or divine self, the spirit on its own plane. Thegreat “Son of Mind,” the thinker on the higher levels of the mental plane, isthe dominating factor now, and the result of this domination is triple, eacheffect manifesting on all planes yet primarily on one or another. These resultsare:1. Rapidity of action like that of the mind. The term “swift as a thought” isfrequently used when an expression of the intensest rapidity is required. In theyogin his acts on the physical plane are so synchronized with his thoughtprocesses, his decisions are so instantaneous and his ends so swiftly achievedthat his physical plane life is characterized by a most startling activity andmost amazing results. Of him it can be said in degree as is said of the Creator:“God meditated, visualized, spoke, and the worlds were made.”2. Perception independent of organs. The adept is not dependent upon the organsof sense for the acquiring of knowledge, nor is he dependent upon the sixthsense, the mind.With him, the intuition has been developed into a usable instrument, and directapprehension of all knowledge, independently of the reasoning faculty [354] orrationalizing mind is his privilege and right. The mind need no longer be usedto apprehend reality, the senses need no longer be employed as mediums ofcontact. He will employ all six but in a different manner. The mind will beutilized as a transmitter to the brain of the wishes, and plans and purposes ofthe one Master, the Christ within; the five senses will be transmitters ofdifferent types of energy to the chosen objectives, and herein opens up a vastfield of study for the interested investigator. The eye is one of the mostpotent transmitters of energy, and it was the knowledge of this in the oldendays which gave rise to the belief anent the evil eye. There is much to bediscovered concerning sight for this study will include not only physicalvision, but the development of the third eye, clairvoyance, perfect spiritualvision and on up to that inconceivable mystery covered by the terms the“All-seeing Eye” and the “Eye of Shiva.” The hands are potent factors in all magical work of healing and utilization ofthe sense of touch is an esoteric science. The sublimation of the sense ofhearing and its utilization to hear the Voice of the Silence, or the music ofthe spheres, is a department of occult teaching of the most profound kind andthose adepts who have specialized in the science of sight, and the science ofsound are some of the most erudite and advanced in the hierarchy.The other senses are capable too of profound unfoldments, but they arepeculiarly hidden in [355] the mysteries of initiation, and more anent them isnot possible here. The three senses of hearing, touch and sight are the threecharacteristics of the three human races and the three planes in our threeworlds.1. Hearing Lemurian Physical plane Ear Response to sound. 2. Touch AtlanteanAstral plane Skin Response to touch or vibration. 3. Sight Aryan Mental body EyeResponse to vision.This third sense primarily affects our race and hence the word of the prophet“Where there is no vision the people perish.” The development of sight and theachievement of spiritual insight is the great objective of our race, and theobjective of all Raja Yoga work. This may be called “illumination” by the mysticor “pure vision” by the occultist but it is one and the same thing.The two other senses are as yet veiled ; their true significance will beunfolded in the sixth or seventh races which are to succeed ours, and their truerelation is to the buddhic or intuitional and the atmic or spiritual planes.3. Mastery over root substance . This root substance is the pradhana and issometimes called the root of all, primordial substance, and root matter. RamaPrasad in his translation and commentary has these words: “Mastery over thePradhana means the power of control over all [356] the modifications of thePrakriti. These three attainments . . . are obtained by conquering thesubstantive appearance of the five instruments of sensation.”It is interesting to note that these three attainments demonstrate:a. The inability of matter and form to hold the yogi confined,b. The powerlessness of substance to prevent the yogi cognizing any aspect ofmanifestation he desires,c. The helplessness of matter to withstand the will of the yogi.These three factors explain how it is that the adept can create at will and hisfreedom from the limitations of matter forms the basis of all white magic.It might be noted in conclusion that this capacity is in itself relative, forthe adept is freed from limitation in the three worlds of human endeavour. TheMaster has perfect freedom of action in the three worlds plus the buddhic realm,whilst the Christ and those of similar initiation have this freedom in the fiveworlds of human evolution.49. The man who can discriminate between the soul and the spirit achievessupremacy over all conditions and becomes omniscient.The condition of the man who can do this has been well described in the commentof Charles Johnston on this sutra and the beauty of his [357] thought will beseen by the study of his words as follows:“The spiritual man is enmeshed in the web of the emotions; desire, fear,ambition, passion; and impeded by the mental forms of separateness andmaterialism. When these meshes are sundered, these obstacles completelyovercome, then the spiritual man stands forth in his own wide world, strong,mighty, wise. He uses divine powers, with a divine scope and energy, workingtogether with divine Companions. To such a one it is said: ‘Thou art now adisciple, able to stand, able to hear, able to see, able to speak, thou hastconquered desire and attained to self-knowledge, thou hast seen thy soul in itsbloom and recognized it, and heard the voice of the silence.’”The wonderful synthesis of the teaching is nowhere more apparent than in thissutra, for the point reached here is of a higher order again than the onereferred to in Book II. Sutra 45, and intermediate to the condition mentionedthere and that referred to in Book IV. Sutra 30 to 34.In Book I. Sutra 4, we find the true man entangled in the meshes of the psychicnature and the light in him veiled and hidden. By learning to discriminatebetween the true self and the lower personal self he disentangles himself, thelight which is in him is seen and he is liberated. Having achieved liberation,developed the soul-powers and attained mastery, there opens up before him astill vaster and wider experience and realization. He can begin to expand hisconsciousness from the planetary to the solar, and group consciousness [358] canbe developed into God consciousness. The first step towards this is stated inthe sutra we are now considering, which is more fully dealt with and hinted atin the final book. The rules for this expansion are not given, for they concernthe development of the Master and the unfoldment of the Christ into that higherstate of being which is for Him possible, but the fourth book touches on thepreparatory stages and hints at further possibilities. Here the first basicrequirement is touched upon, discrimination between the soul, the Christ withinand the spirit or Father aspect. Intelligent activity has been demonstrated,based upon an unfoldment of the love nature. With safety now the spirit or willaspect can be developed and power delivered into the hands of the Christ.Three terms serve to throw light on this process of unfoldment.The first great realization which the aspirant has to achieve is that ofomnipresence ; he has to realize his unity with all, and the oneness of his soulwith all other souls. He has to find God in his own heart and in every form oflife. Then, as an initiate, he arrives at omniscience or all-knowledge, and theHalls of Learning and of Wisdom render up to him their secrets. He becomes aChrist, a knower of all things, knowing what is in the heart of the Father andin the hearts of men. Finally, he can eventually achieve omnipotence orall-power, when the keys of Heaven will be handed to the Son of Man and allpower will be his. [359]50. By a passionless attitude towards this attainment and towards allsoul-powers, the one who is free from the seeds of bondage, attains thecondition of isolated unity.The isolated unity referred to here is that of complete separation from all formaspects and the achievement of spiritual Oneness. It is aloofness from thematerial consciousness and a living in the spiritual consciousness. It isharmony with the spirit and disharmony with matter. It involves identificationwith the Father in Heaven, and a true understanding of the word of the Master ofall the Masters, “I and My Father are one.” A proper sense of values has been established and the powers which have beendeveloped, and the perceptions which have been gained are seen as having in themthe “seeds of bondage” and therefore with them the true yogin does not concernhimself. At will and in service he will perceive that which is needed; at willand in service he will employ the occult powers, but he himself remainsdetached, and freed from all karmic limitations.51. There should be entire rejection of all allurements from all forms of being,even the celestial, for the recurrence of evil contacts remains possible.Rama Prasad’s translation is illuminating and should be quoted here. It runs asfollows:“When the presiding deities invite, there should [360] be no attachment and nosmile of satisfaction, contact with the undesirable being again possible.”And Dvivedi’s interpretation gives still another angle:“There should be entire distinction of pleasure or pride in the invitations bythe powers of various places, for there is possibility of the repetition ofevil.”The yogin or disciple has achieved his objective. He has (through dispassion anddiscrimination) freed himself from the trammels of form and stands free andliberated. But he needs to be on his guard for “Let him that thinketh hestandeth take heed lest he fall.” Form life ever beckons, and the allurements ofthe great illusion are ever present. The emancipated soul must turn his eyesaway from the invitation of the “presiding deities” (those lives who in thethree worlds form the sum total of plane life) and fix them on those morespiritual aspects which constitute the life of God Himself.Even the realm of the soul itself, and the “Voice of the Gods,” as it is called,are seen to have latent in them the seeds of attachment; therefore, turning hisback upon all that he has gained, and putting behind him all thought of theperfections achieved and the powers developed, the Son of God, the Christ inmanifestation, again presses forward towards a higher goal. At every stage ofthe path, the injunction sounds forth: “Forgetting the things which are behind,press forward” (Phil: IV.), and every new initiation but marks [361] thecommencement of a new cycle of endeavour.Commentators upon this sutra point out that there are four classes of chelas ordisciples. These are:1. Those whom the light is just beginning to illumine. They are called“observant of practice,” and are those who are just entering the Path. These arethe probationers, the aspirants.2. Those whose intuition is awakening and who demonstrate a correspondingdevelopment of psychic power. This is a stage of great danger for such disciplesare apt to be allured by the possibilities of power which the possession ofpsychic faculty opens up. They are apt to be deluded and to consider thatpsychic power is an indication of spiritual growth and unfoldment. Such is notthe case.3. Those disciples who have overcome all sense attractions and cannot be deludedby the form aspect in the three worlds. They have conquered the senses and arevictors over the form nature.4. Those who have passed beyond all the above and who stand firm in the truespiritual consciousness. These are the illuminated ones, who have progressedthrough the seven stages of illumination. See Book II., Sutra 27.If the student will here study Book III. Sutra 26, and the commentary upon it,he will gain some idea of the nature of these worlds of form and their presidingdeities whose voices seek to lure the aspirant off the path into the realm ofillusion. He will find it also of interest to contrast and compare the firstfour classes of spirits enumerated [362] there with these four types ofdisciples. Everything in the three worlds is a reflection of that which is foundin the heavenly realms and much may be gained through a comprehension of thegreat Hermetic aphorism, “As above, so below.” That reflection is whatconstitutes evil; that reverse aspect of reality forms the great illusion, andwith these the sons of God have no concern. It is evil where they are concernedbut in no other sense. The forms of life in these worlds, and the livesanimating those forms are good and right in themselves and are pursuing theirown evolutionary path, but their immediate objective and their state ofconsciousness is not synchronized with that of the evolving disciple andtherefore with them there must be no trafficking.52. Intuitive knowledge is developed through the use of the discriminativefaculty when there is one-pointed concentration upon moments and theircontinuous succession.It has been said that a complete understanding of the Law of Cycles would bringman to a high degree of initiation. This Law of Periodicity underlies all theprocesses of nature and its study would lead a man out of the world of objectiveeffects into that of subjective causes. It has also been said that time itselfis simply a succession of states of consciousness and this is true of an atom, aman or a God. It is this truth which underlies the great systems of mentalscience and Christian Science in the occident, and many of the [363] orientalphilosophies. This sutra gives the key to the relation between matter and mind,or between substance and its informing soul, and this can be realized when thewords of a Hindu commentator are considered. He says:“As an atom is a substance in which minuteness reaches its limit, so a moment isa division of time in which minuteness reaches its limit. Or a moment is thatmuch of time which an atom takes in leaving the position in space it occupiesand reaching the next point. The succession of moments is the non-cessation ofthe glow thereof.”When we can realize that an atom and a moment are one and the same, and thatback of these lies the Realizer or Cognizer of both, we have got the clue to allstates of consciousness itself, and to the nature of energy. We shall also havereached a true understanding of the Eternal Now, and a just appreciation of thesignificance of the past, the present, and the future. This, we are told here,can be gained by concentrated meditation upon time and its units.It might be appropriate here to point out that the various kinds ofconcentration dealt with in this third book are not applicable or appropriate toall types of aspirants. Men are found to exist in seven main types, withdistinguishing characteristics and natures and with definite qualitiespredisposing them to certain definite aspects of the Path of Return. Certaintypes with mathematical bent and with a tendency to divine geometry and spaceand time concepts, will with wisdom follow the method of developing intuitive[364] knowledge, dealt with in this sutra; others will find it of greatdifficulty and would wisely turn to other forms of concentrated meditation.53. From this intuitive knowledge is born the capacity to distinguish (betweenall beings) and to cognize their genus, qualities and position in space.The difficulty of this sutra will be obviated if a free paraphrase is heregiven.“Through the development of the intuition there will arise exact knowledge ofthe sources of the manifested life, of its characteristics or qualities, and ofits location within the whole.”Right through the Yoga Sutras it has been made apparent that the divinetriplicities are everywhere to be found, and that every form ensouling a life(and there is naught else in manifestation) is to be known as:1. Life . The life of God emanates from its source in seven streams, emanationsor “breaths,” and every form in the objective world is the expression of a lifeas breathed forth on one or other of these streams. The development of theintuition enables the seer to know the nature of the life atom. This is inferredin the word “genus.” The modern occultist might prefer the word “ray,” and theChristian “pneuma” or spirit, but the thought is one.2. Consciousness or soul. All these living forms of divine life are conscious,even though all states of consciousness are not the same but range from the lifeof the atom of substance, limited [365] and circumscribed as it may be, to thatof a solar Logos. The state of the conscious response of all forms to theirenvironment, exoteric and unseen, produces the varying characteristics plus thedistinction produced by:a. Ray,b. Plane of manifestation,c. Rate of vibration,d. Point of development,and these characteristics form the quality referred to in the sutra. This is thesubjective aspect in contradistinction to the objective and the essential.3. Form or body. This is the exoteric aspect, that which emerges from thesubjective as a result of spiritual urge. The position in space is that part ofthe body of the Heavenly Man in which any atom or form has its locale. Here itshould be remembered that according to the occult student “space is an entity”(Secret Doctrine I. 583), and this entity is one and the same as the cosmicChrist, the “body of Christ,” referred to by St. Paul in I. Cor. XII.In this sutra, therefore, it is made apparent that the liberated yogi who hasdeveloped the intuition can know all things about all forms of life, and thisinvolves a knowledge of:1. Genus. 2. Quality. 3. Position in Space. Ray Character Place in body ofHeavenly Man. Spirit Soul Body. Life aspect Consciousness Form. EssenceSubjective nature Objective form.[366]Of this knower we can apply the words of the teacher whose works are found inthe archives of the Lodge:“To him, standing before the Spark, the flame and the smoke are equally to beseen.To him, the shadow veils the reflection and yet the light is seen.To him, the tangible but demonstrates the intangible, and both reveal thespirit, whilst form, color and number speak aloud the word of God.”54. This intuitive knowledge, which is the great Deliverer, is omnipresent andomniscient and includes the past, the present and the future in the Eternal Now.The only part of this sutra which is not clear even to the superficial reader isthe significance of the words Eternal Now, and these it is not possible tocomprehend until soul-consciousness is developed. To say that time is asuccession of states of consciousness and that the present is lost in the pastinstantaneously, and merged in the future as it is experienced, is of smallavail to the average student. To say that there is a time when sight is lost invision, when the sum total of life anticipations are realized in a moment ofaccomplishment and that this persists for ever, and to point to a state ofconsciousness in which there is no sequence of events and no succession ofrealizations is to speak in a language of mystery. Yet so it is and will be.When the aspirant has reached his goal he knows the true significance of hisimmortality and the true nature of his liberation. [367] Space and time becomefor him meaningless terms. The only true Reality is seen to be the great centrallife force, remaining unchanged and unmoved at the centre of the changingevanescent temporal forms.“I am,” says the human unit and regards himself as the self, and identifieshimself with the changing form. Time and space are for him the true realities.“I am That,” says the aspirant and seeks to know himself as he truly is, aliving word, part of a cosmic phrase. For him space no longer exists; he knowshimself as omnipresent. “I am That I am,” says the freed soul, the liberatedman, the Christ. Neither time nor space exist for him, and omniscience andomnipresence are his distinctive qualities.In his comment upon this sutra, Charles Johnston quotes from St. Columba andsays:“Some there are, though very few, to whom divine grace has granted this: thatthey can clearly and most distinctly see, at one and the same moment, as thoughunder one ray of the sun, even the entire circuit of the whole world with itssurroundings of ocean and sky, the innermost part of their mind beingmarvellously enlarged.”It might be helpful also if the brief comment of Dvivedi were quoted here as itis well put, and the state of consciousness arrived at concisely summed up:“In aphorism XXXIII. of this section we have already described the nature oftaroka-jnana—the knowledge that saves from the bonds of the world. Thediscriminative knowledge described [368] here results in taraka, the knowledgewhich is the end and aim of yoga. It relates to all objects from the pradhana(spirit-matter. A.B.) to the bhutas (elements. forms. A.B.), as also to allconditions of these objects. Moreover it produces knowledge of all thingssimultaneously, and is quite independent of the ordinary rules of cognition.Hence it is the highest knowledge which can be desired by the yogin, and it is asure index of Kaivalya (state of absolute oneness. A.A.B.) to be described inthe following aphorism as its result.”55. When the objective forms and the soul have reached a condition of equalpurity, then is At-one-ment achieved and liberation results.That which veils the light of the soul has been rendered pure, and thus thelight of God streams forth. That which proved a hindrance and an obstacle to thefull expression of divinity in manifestation has been so dealt with that now itserves as an adequate expression and means of service. The soul can now functionfreely and intelligently in the three worlds because complete unity has beenreached between the lower and the higher man.The soul and its vehicles form a unit and are at one; complete alignment of thebodies has been achieved and the Son of God can function freely on earth. Thushas the great objective been reached and through a following of the eight meansof yoga the soul can manifest through the [369] lower threefold man, and in itsturn form a medium of expression for the spirit. Matter has been brought into astate where its vibration can synchronise with that of the soul, and the resultis that—for the first time—spirit can make its presence felt, for “matter is thevehicle for the manifestation of soul on this plane of experience and the soulis the vehicle for the manifestation of spirit on a higher turn of the spiral.These three are a trinity synthesized by life which pervades them all.” To theman who has achieved this there is no rebirth. He is free and liberated, and cansay with full conscious realization of the significance of the words:“My life (the lower physical life) is hid with Christ (the soul life) in God(the spirit).” (Col: III. 3.)"},{"pageContent":"BOOK IV. - ILLUMINATION...TOPIC: ISOLATED UNITY.[373] 1. The higher and lower siddhis (or powers) are gained by incarnation, orby drugs, words of power, intense desire or by meditation.2. The transfer of the consciousness from a lower vehicle into a higher is partof the great creative and evolutionary process.3. The practices and methods are not the true cause of the transfer ofconsciousness but they serve to remove obstacles, just as the husbandmanprepares his ground for sowing.4. The “I am” consciousness is responsible for the creation of the organsthrough which the sense of individuality is enjoyed.5. Consciousness is one, yet produces the varied forms of the many.6. Among the forms which consciousness assumes, only that which is the result ofmeditation is free from latent karma.7. The activities of the liberated soul are free from the pairs of opposites.Those of other people are of three kinds.8. From these three kinds of karma emerge those forms which are necessary forthe fruition of the effects.9. There is identity of relation between memory and the effect-producing cause,even when separated by species, time and place.10. Desire to live being eternal, these mind-created forms are without knownbeginning. [374]11. These forms being created and held together through desire, the basic cause,personality, the effective result, mental vitality or the will to live, and thesupport of the outward going life or object, when these cease to attract thenthe forms cease likewise to be.12. The past and the present exist in reality. The form assumed in the timeconcept of the present is the result of developed characteristics and holdslatent seeds of future quality.13. The characteristics, whether latent or potent, partake of the nature of thethree gunas (qualities of matter).14. The manifestation of the objective form is due to the one-pointedness of theeffect-producing cause (the unification of the modifications of the chitta ormind stuff).15. These two, consciousness and form, are distinct and separate; though formsmay be similar, the consciousness may function on differing levels of being.16. The many modifications of the one mind produce the diverse forms, whichdepend for existence upon those many mind impulses.17. These forms are cognized or not, according to the qualities latent in theperceiving consciousness.18. The Lord of the mind, the perceiver, is ever aware of the constantly activemind stuff, the effect-producing cause.19. Because it can be seen or cognised it is apparent that the mind is not thesource of illumination.20. Neither can it know two objects simultaneously, itself and that which isexternal to itself.21. If knowledge of the mind (chitta) by a remoter mind is postulated, aninfinite number of knowers must be inferred, and the sequence of memoryreactions would tend to infinite confusion.22. When the spiritual intelligence which stands alone and freed from objects,reflects itself in the mind stuff, then comes awareness of the Self.23. Then the mind stuff, reflecting both the knower and the knowable, becomesomniscient. [375]24. The mind stuff also, reflecting as it does an infinity of mind impressions,becomes the instrument of the Self and acts as a unifying agent.25. The state of isolated unity (withdrawn into the true nature of the Self) isthe reward of the man who can discriminate between the mind stuff and the Self,or spiritual man.26. The mind then tends towards discrimination and increasing illumination as tothe true nature of the one Self.27. Through force of habit, however, the mind will reflect other mentalimpressions and perceive objects of sensuous perception.28. These reflections are of the nature of hindrances, and the method of theirovercoming is the same.29. The man who develops non-attachment even in his aspiration afterillumination and isolated unity, becomes aware, eventually, through practiseddiscrimination, of the overshadowing cloud of spiritual knowledge.30. When this stage is reached then the hindrances and karma are overcome.31. When, through the removal of the hindrances and the purification of all thesheaths, the totality of knowledge becomes available, naught further remains forthe man to do.32. The modifications of the mind stuff (or qualities of matter) through theinherent nature of the three gunas come to an end, for they have served theirpurpose.33. Time, which is the sequence of the modifications of the mind, likewiseterminates, giving place to the Eternal Now.34. The state of isolated unity becomes possible when the three qualities ofmatter (the three gunas or potencies of nature) no longer exercise any hold overthe Self. The pure spiritual consciousness withdraws into the One.CONSCIOUSNESS AND FORM.1. The higher and lower siddhis (or powers) are gained by incarnation, or bydrugs, words of power, intense desire or by meditation.We have now come to the fourth book in which the powers and the results gainedby the practice of Raja Yoga are carried forward into group realization and itis seen that they produce universal consciousness and not simplyself-consciousness. It seems the part of wisdom to protest here against the useof the words “cosmic consciousness” as untrue and misleading, for even thehighest adept (note this term with care) is only gifted with solar consciousnessand has no contact with that which is outside our solar system. The planetaryLogoi (the seven Spirits before the Throne), and the Lords of Karma (the “fourwheels” of Ezekiel) have a realization beyond that of our solar system. Lesserexistences may sense it as a possibility but it is not yet part of theirexperience. [378]The powers gained fall into two main groups called:a. Lower psychic powers, the lower siddhis.b. Spiritual powers or the higher siddhis.The lower powers are the result of the consciousness of the animal soul in manbeing en rapport with the anima mundi or the soul of the world, the subjectiveside of all forms in the three worlds, of all bodies in the four kingdoms ofnature. The higher powers are the result of the development of groupconsciousness, of the second aspect of divinity. They not only include thelesser powers but put a man en rapport with those existences and forms of lifewhich are to be found in the spiritual realms, or, as the occultist would say,on those two planes which are beyond the three worlds, and which cover theentire scale of man’s evolution, human and superhuman.The goal of the true aspirant is the unfoldment of these higher powers which canbe covered by the terms direct knowledge, intuitive perception, spiritualinsight, pure vision, the attainment of the wisdom. They are different from thelower powers, for they abrogate them. These latter are accurately described forus in Book III, Sutra 37:“These powers are obstacles to the highest spiritual realization, but serve asmagical powers in the objective worlds.”These higher powers are inclusive and are distinguished by their accuracy andinfallibility when rightly employed. Their working is as instantaneous [379] asa flash of light. The lower powers are fallible, the time element is present inits sequential sense and they are limited in their working. They form part ofthe great illusion and to the true aspirant constitute a limitation.In the sutra we are considering, five means are given whereby the psychic powersare developed and it is interesting to note that we have in these words aninstance of the fact that the Yoga Sutras can still be the study and teachingmanual of even such advanced aspirants as the Masters of the Wisdom. These fivemethods are capable of application upon all the five planes of human evolution,which include the two higher planes whereon initiates of the Mysteries function.1. Incarnation The physical plane method. 2. Drugs The release of the astralconsciousness. 3. Words of Power Creation by speech, or the method of the mentalplane. 4. Intense desire The sublimation of aspiration or the method of thebuddhic plane, the sphere of spiritual love. 5. Meditation The method of theatmic plane, the sphere of spiritual will.In this enumeration, it might be noted that just as intense desire of aspiritual kind is a sublimation of astral or emotional desire, so meditation, aspractised by the initiates, is the sublimation of all the mental processes.Therefore the two final methods given as resulting in the unfoldment of thesiddhis are the only ones that are practised by [380] initiates, being thesynthesis and sublimation of the realizations achieved on the astral and mentalplanes.It might, therefore, be observed that (for the seeker after truth) incarnation,intense desire and meditation are the three permissible methods, and the onlyones to be practised; drugs and words of power or mantric incantations are thetools of black magic and concern the lower powers.The question might here be asked, is it not true that words of power and the useof incense form part of the ceremonies of initiation and therefore are used byinitiates and aspirants. Certainly, but not in the sense understood here, or forthe purpose of developing psychic powers. The Masters and their disciples usewords of power in order to deal with the non-human existences, to invoke the aidof the angels, and to manipulate the building forces of nature, and they employherbs and incenses in order to purify conditions, eliminate undesirable entitiesand so make it possible for those higher upon the ladder of evolution to maketheir presence felt. This is, however, a very different thing to their use inorder to become psychic.It is interesting to note here that the first cause producing the unfoldment ofsoul powers, whether higher or lower, is the great wheel of rebirth. This mustever be taken into account. Everyone is not yet at the stage where it ispossible for him to unfold the powers of the soul. The soul aspect is stilldormant for many because full experience and development of the lower nature hasnot yet [381] been undergone. The forty years’ wandering in the wilderness withthe Tabernacle and the conquest of Canaan, had to precede the rule of the kingsand the building of the Temple of Solomon. Lives must be passed before the body,or the Mother aspect, is so perfected that the Christ Child can be formed withinthe prepared vessel. It should also be remembered that the possession of thelower psychic powers is in many cases a symptom of a low stage of evolution andof the close association of their owner with the animal nature. This has to beoutgrown before the higher powers can blossom forth.It is needless to point out that the use of alcohol and of drugs can and doesrelease the astral consciousness, as also the practice of sex magic, but this isastralism pure and simple and with this the true student of Raja Yoga has naughtto do. It is part of unfoldment on the left-hand Path. The gaining of the soulpowers by intense desire (or fervent aspiration) and by meditation has beencovered in the other books and need not be enlarged upon here.2. The transfer of the consciousness from a lower vehicle into a higher is partof the great creative and evolutionary process.This is a very free translation but conveys a clear interpretation of the truthto be grasped. The evolution of consciousness and the effect of that evolutionupon the vehicles in which the conscious entity functions, is the sum total ofthe [382] processes of nature and from the standpoint of the intelligent humanunit, three words cover the process and the result. These words are, transfer,transmutation, and transformation.One of the basic laws in occult development and in spiritual unfoldment is givenin the words “As a man thinketh, so is he,” and to it one can link the orientaltruism, “Energy follows thought” as an explanation. As a man changes hisdesires, so he changes himself; as he shifts his consciousness from oneobjective to another, so he alters himself, and this is true in all realms andstates, higher or lower.The effect of the transference of our conscious thinking state from a lowobjective to a high one produces a flow of energy of a vibratory qualityequivalent to the higher objective. This produces a change or a mutation in thevestures of the thinking entity, and they become transmuted and brought to acondition where they are adequate to the thought or desire of the man. Carriedto their conclusion, a transformation is produced, and the words of St. Paulbecome therefore clear: “Be ye therefore transformed by the renewing of yourmind.”Change your line of thought and you will change your nature. Desire that whichis true and right, pure and holy, and your consciousness of these things willcreate out of the old a new vehicle or new man, an “instrument meet for use.”This transfer, transmutation and eventual transformation is due to one of twomethods: [383]1. A slow method, that of repeated lives, experiences and physical incarnationuntil eventually the driving force of the evolutionary process brings a man,stage by stage, up the great ladder of evolution.2. A more rapid process, wherein through such a system as outlined by Patanjaliand as taught by all the custodians of the mysteries of religion, a mandefinitely takes himself in hand, and through conformity to the rules and thelaws laid down, brings himself, by his own effort, to a state of spiritualunfoldment. It might be noted here that these three processes bring a man tothat initiation called the Transfiguration.3. The practices and methods are not the true cause of the transfer ofconsciousness, but they serve to remove obstacles, just as the husbandmanprepares his ground for sowing.This is one of the simplest and clearest of the sutras and needs but littlecomment.The practices refer primarily to:1. The means for removing obstacles. (See Book I. Sutras 29 to 39.) This isaffected, we are told earlier, by:a. Steady application to a principle,b. Sympathy with all beings,c. Regulation of the prana or life-breath,d. Steadiness of the mind,e. Meditation upon light,f. Purification of the lower nature,g. The understanding of the dream state, [384]h. The way of devotion.2. The way of eliminating obstructions. (See Book II. Sutras 2 to 33.) Theseobstructions are eliminated by:a. An opposing mental attitude,b. Meditation,c. The cultivation of right thought.They concern more specifically the life preparation for the true training inyoga practice, and when practiced, bring the entire lower nature into such acondition that the more drastic methods can produce rapid effects.The methods refer to the eight means of yoga or union, enumerated as follows:the commandments, the rules, posture or attitude, right control of the lifeforce, abstraction, attention, meditation and contemplation. (See Book II,Sutras 29 to 54, and Book III. Sutras 1 to 12.)The Commandments, the Rules, posture or attitude, right control of the lifeforce, abstraction, attention, meditation and contemplation.It might be noted, therefore, that we could refer the practices morespecifically to that stage in the life of the aspirant in which he is upon theprobationary path, the path of purification, whilst the methods relate to thefinal stages of that path, and to the path of discipleship. When the practicesand methods are followed they bring about certain changes within the formsoccupied by the real or spiritual man, but are not the main cause of thetransfer of his consciousness to the soul aspect and away from the body aspect.That great change is the result of certain causes, extraneous [385] to thebody-nature, such as the divine origin of the man, the fact that the Christ orthe soul consciousness is found latent within those forms, and the urge of theevolutionary process which carries the life of God within all forms onward intoever fuller expression. It should be remembered that as the one Life in Whom welive and move and have our being, moves on to greater achievement, so the cellsand atoms in His body are correspondingly influenced, stimulated and developed.4. The “I am” consciousness is responsible for the creation of the organsthrough which the sense of individuality is enjoyed.Here we have the key to manifestation itself and the reason for all appearances.Just as long as the consciousness of any entity (solar, planetary or human) isoutward going towards objects of desire, towards sentient existence, towardsindividual experience, and towards the life of sensuous perception andenjoyment, just so long will the vehicles or organs be created whereby desirecan be satisfied, materialized existence can be enjoyed, and objects perceived.This is the great illusion by which consciousness is glamoured, and as long asthe glamour exerts any power, just so long will the Law of Rebirth bring theoutward-going consciousness into manifestation upon the plane of materiality. Itis the will-to-be and desire for existence that swings outward into the lightboth the cosmic Christ, functioning [386] on the material plane through themedium of the solar system, and the individual Christ, functioning through themedium of the human form.In the early stages the “I am” consciousness creates forms of matter inadequatefor the full expression of the divine powers. As evolution proceeds these formsbecome increasingly suitable until the “organs” created enable the spiritual manto enjoy the sense of individuality. When this stage is arrived at, there comesthe great realization of illusion. The consciousness awakes to the fact that inform and sense perception, and in the outward going tendency, lie no real joy orpleasure, and there starts a new effort which is characterized by a gradualwithdrawal of the outward-going tendency and an abstraction of the spirit fromout of the form.5. Consciousness is one, yet produces the varied forms of the many.Here Patanjali lays down a basic formula which serves to explain not only thepurpose and reason of manifestation itself but covers in one short phrase thestate of being of God, man and atom. Behind all forms is found the one Life;within every atom (solar, planetary, human and elemental) is found the onesentient existence; back of objective nature, the sum total of all forms in allthe kingdoms of nature is found the subjective reality which is essentially aunified whole or unity, producing the diversified many. [387] The homogeneous isthe cause of the heterogeneous, unity produces diversity, the One is responsiblefor the many. This the student can appreciate more intelligently if he followsthe golden rule which reveals the mystery of creation and studies himself. Themicrocosm reveals the nature of the macrocosm.He will find that he, the real or spiritual man, the thinker, or the one life inhis tiny system, is responsible for the creation of his mental, emotional andphysical bodies, his three lower aspects, the “shadow” of the Trinity, just ashis spirit, soul and body are the reflections of the three divine aspects,Father, Son and Holy Spirit. He will find that he is responsible for theformation of all the organs in his body, and for all the cells of which they arecomposed and as he studies his problem more closely he will become aware thathis consciousness and life pervades, and is therefore responsible for, myriadsbeyond number of tiny infinitesimal lives; that he is the cause of theiraggregation into organs and forms, and the reason those forms are held in being.Gradually there dawns on him a true understanding of the significance of thewords “made in the image of God.” His “consciousness is one and yet has producedthe varied forms of the many” within his little cosmos, and what is true of himis true of his great prototype, the Heavenly Man, the planetary Logos, and trueagain of the prototype of his prototype, the Grand Man of the Heavens, the solarLogos, God in manifestation through the solar system. [388]6. Among the forms which consciousness assumes, only that which is the result ofmeditation is free from latent karma.Forms are the result of desire. Meditation of the right kind is a purely mentalprocess and into it desire enters not. Forms are the result of an outward-goingurge or tendency. Meditation is the result of an inward-turning tendency, of thecapacity to abstract the consciousness from form and substance and to centre itwithin itself.Form is an effect produced by the love or desire nature of the conscious one;meditation is a producer of effects and relates to the will or life aspect ofthe spiritual man.Desire produces effects, and the organs of sentient consciousness then comeinevitably the law of cause and effect, of karma, which governs the relation ofform—consciousness. The meditation process, when rightly understood and carriedon, necessitates the withdrawal of the consciousness of the spiritual man fromall forms in the three worlds, and his abstraction from all sense perception andtendencies. Thus he stands at the moment of pure meditation free from thataspect of karma which deals with the producing of effects. Temporarily, he is soabstracted that his thought, perfectly concentrated and having no relation toaught in the three worlds, produces no outward-going vibration, relates to noform, affects no substance. When this concentrated meditation becomes a habitand is the normal daily attitude of his life, then the man becomes free from thelaw [389] of karma. He becomes aware then of the effects still remaining to beworked off, and learns to avoid the creation of new ones, initiating no actionswhich will “create organs” in the three worlds. He dwells on the plane of mind,persists in meditation, creates by an act of will and not through thehelplessness of desire, and is a “free soul,” a master and a liberated man.7. The activities of the liberated soul are free from the pairs of opposites.Those of other people are of three kinds.This sutra expresses the teaching in connection with the law of karma in such astrictly oriental manner as to confuse the western student considerably. Ananalysis of the significance of these words and a study of the commentary of thegreat teacher Vyasa may serve to elucidate the meaning. It should also be bornein mind that in the fourth book we are dealing with the exalted stages ofconsciousness reached by those who have followed the eight means of yoga andhave experienced the effects of meditation, detailed in Book III. The yogi isnow a liberated man, freed from form conditions and focussed in hisconsciousness outside the bounds of the three worlds of human endeavor. He hasreached the realm of pure thought and can hold his consciousness untrammelledand free from desire. Therefore, though he formulates ideas and though he cancarry on powerful meditations and though he can direct and control the“modifications of the thinking [390] principle,” he creates no conditions whichcan serve to draw him back into the vortex of lower plane existence. He is freedfrom karma and originates nothing and no effects can serve to attach him to thewheel of rebirth.Vyasa in his commentary points out that karma (or action) is of four kinds whichare expressed for us as follows:1. That type of activity which is evil, wicked and depraved. This is calledblack . This class of action is the product of the deepest ignorance, of thedensest materiality, or of deliberate choice. Where it is the result ofignorance, the development of knowledge will gradually bring about a state ofconsciousness where this type of karma is no longer known. Where densemateriality produces what we call wrong action, the gradual development of thespiritual consciousness will change darkness to light and karma again isobviated. Where, however, it is the result of deliberate choice, or ofpreference for wrong action, in spite of knowledge and in defiance of the voiceof the spiritual nature, then this type of karma leads to what the orientaloccultist called “avitchi” or the eighth sphere,—a term synonymous with theChristian idea of the condition of being a lost soul. These cases are, however,exceedingly rare, and have relation to the left hand path, and the practice ofblack magic. Though this condition involves the severing of the highestprinciple (that of pure spirit from its two expressions, the soul and the body,or from the six lower principles), yet the life itself remains, and after the[391] destruction of the soul in avitchi, a fresh cycle of becoming will againbe offered.2. That type of activity which is neither all good nor all bad, which is spokenof as the black-white. It concerns the karmic activity of the average man, whois governed by the pairs of opposites, and whose life experience ischaracterized by a swinging back and forth between that which is kindly,harmless, and the result of love, and that which is harsh, harmful, and theresult of hate. Vyasa says:“The black-white is brought about by external means, as in this, the vehicle ofactions grows by means of causing pain to, or acting kindly towards others.”It becomes apparent therefore that the growth of the human unit and his recordare dependent upon his attitude towards others and the effect he has upon them.Thus is the return to group consciousness brought about and thus is karmagenerated or offset. Thus, also, is the swing of the pendulum between thesepairs of opposites gradually adjusted until the point of equilibrium is reached,and man acts rightly because the law of love or of the soul, directs from above,and not because either good or bad desire attract him on either hand.3. That type of activity which is called white. This is the type of livingthought, and work, practised by the aspirant and the disciple. It characterizesthe stage of the Path prior to liberation. Vyasa explains it thus: [392]“The white is of those who resort to the means of improvement, of study andmeditation. This is dependent upon the mind alone. It does not depend uponexternal means, it is not, therefore, brought about by injuring others.”It will be apparent now that these three types of karma have direct referenceto:a. The plane of materiality the physical plane. b. The plane of the pairs ofopposites the astral plane. c. The plane of one-pointed though the mental plane.Those whose karma is white are those who, having made progress in balancing thepairs of opposites, are now engaged in the process of conscious intelligentemancipation of themselves from the three worlds. This they do through:a. Study , or mental development, through an appreciation of the law ofevolution and an understanding of the nature of consciousness and its relationto matter on the one hand and to spirit on the other.b. Meditation , or mind control and thus the creation of that mechanism whichrenders to the soul the control of the lower vehicles, and makes possible therevelation of the soul realm.c. Non-injury. No word, thought or deed brings harm to any form through whichthe life of God is expressing itself.4. The final type of karma is described as neither black nor white . No karma ofany kind is engendered; no effects are set up through causes initiated by theyogi that can serve to hold him to the form side of manifestation. Acting as hedoes from the standpoint of non-attachment, desiring [393] nothing for himself,his karma is nil, and his acts produce no effects upon himself.8. From these three kinds of karma emerge those forms which are necessary forthe fruition of effects.In every life, as it comes into physical manifestation, are latent those germsor seeds which must bear fruit, and it is these latent seeds which are theefficient cause of the appearance of the form. Those seeds have been sown atsome time and must come to fruition. They are the causes or skandas whichproduce those bodies in which the effects are to work themselves out. They arethe desires, impulses and obligations which keep a man upon the great wheel,which ever turning, carries a man down into physical plane existence, there tobring to fruition as many of those seeds, as under the law, he can handle ordeal with in any one life. These are the subjective germs which produce the formin which they fructify, mature and come to completion. If the karmic seeds areblack, the man will be grossly selfish, material, and inclined to the left handpath; if black-white, they will carry him into a form suitable for the workingout of his obligations, of his debts, duties and interests and the fulfilling ofhis desires; if they are white they tend to build that body which is the finalone to be destroyed, the causal body, the temple of Solomon, the karana sariraof the occultist. That body, at the final liberation, is itself destroyed and[394] naught then separates the man from his Father in Heaven, and nothing keepshim linked to the lower material plane.9. There is identity of relation between memory and effect producing cause, evenwhen separated by species, time and place.A paraphrase of the sutra might serve to elucidate, and might be expressed asfollows: No matter what the race may have been, no matter in what continent,past or present, a life may have been passed, and no matter how distant thatlife may be or how many millenia of years may have elapsed, the memory remainswith the ego or soul. In due time, under proper adjustment, every cause theninitiated must inevitably work out into effects and those effects will appear,working out in some one life. Nothing can prevent it, nothing can stop it.Charles Johnston expresses it in his commentary in the following words: “In like manner, the same over-ruling selective power, which is a ray of theHigher Self, gathers together from different births and times and places thosemind-images which are conformable, and may be grouped in the frame of a singlelife or a single event. Through this grouping, visible bodily conditions oroutward circumstances are brought about, and by these the soul is taught andtrained.Just as the dynamic mind-images of desire ripen out in bodily conditions andcircumstances, so the far more dynamic powers of aspiration, [395] wherein thesoul reaches toward the Eternal, have their fruition in a finer world, buildingthe vesture of the spiritual man.”10. Desire to live being eternal, these mind-created forms are without knownbeginning.Another term which might be used in connection with the words “desire to live”is “the will to experience.” Inherent in the informing self-conscious lives ofour system (those existences who are superhuman and human) is this desire to be,this longing to become, this urge to contact the unknown and the distant. Theexplanation of this urge, being cosmic and dependent upon the evolutionarystandpoint of that great Life in whom we live and move and have our being and inWhose body every form is but a cell or atom, is impossible for us to comprehend.All that a man can do is to build the mechanism which will make thiscomprehension possible, and to develop those powers which will enable him tocontact and thus be en rapport with that which lies both without and within him.When this becomes possible he awakes to the realization that those desires whichdrive and impel him to action, those longings which force him into variedactivities are something which are not only personal and real, but which arealso part of the activity of the whole of which he is a tiny part. He discoversthat the stream of desire-impelled mind images which occupy his attention andform the motive power of his life are formulated by himself, [396] but are alsopart of a stream of cosmic mind images arising in the Universal Mind, as theresult of the activity of that cosmic Thinker who functions as the Life of oursolar system.Thus the truth and teaching which has been formulated in the three previousbooks is lifted from the realm of the personal and the individual, and becomeswider, broader and more general. For the human unit the mind images, the resultof desire and of thought action are therefore without known beginning. Theysurround him on all sides, the stream of their activity beats upon him at alltimes and draws forth from him that response which bears witness to theexistence of desire within himself.Therefore for him there must come two new activities; first, that of transmutingand transcending those desires and longings for sensuous perception which arefound within himself, and secondly the task of insulating himself or isolatinghimself from the allure and influence of those greater streams of mind imageswhich eternally exist. Thus only can he achieve the “condition of IsolatedUnity” described in Book III. Sutra 50.11. These forms, being created and held together through desire, the basiccause, personality, the effective result, mental vitality or the will to live,and the support of the outward-going life or object, when these cease toattract, then the forms cease likewise to be.This sutra expresses a law of nature, and is so clear that but littleexplanation is needed. It [397] might be of value, however, if we analyzedbriefly the teaching given here.We learn that four factors contribute to the existence of mind-images, or theforms which come into being as the result of the desire nature.1. The basic cause desire. 2. The effect or result personality. 3. The will tolive mental vitality. 4. The outward going life the object.When the cause, desire, has produced its effect, the personality or form aspectof man, then as long as the will to live exists, so long will the form persist.It is kept in manifestation through mental vitality. This has been demonstratedtime and again in the annals of medicine, for it has been proven that as long asthe determination to live persists so will be the probable duration of thephysical plane life, but that the moment that will is withdrawn, or the interestof the dweller in the body is no longer centered upon personality manifestation,death ensues and the disintegration of that mind-image, the body, takes place.It is interesting to note the occult meaning conveyed in the words “the supportof the outward going life, or object” for it substantiates the occult teachingthat the life stream passes downward from the originating cause and finds itsobject or final manifestation in the vital or etheric body which is the truesubstance of every form, and which constitutes the support or scaffold of thedense physical vehicle.These four factors can be well divided into [398] two groups or pairs ofopposites, the cause and the effect, the will to be and the true form or object.For a long period in the evolutionary process the object or form-existence isthe sole interest of the indweller, and the outward going life becomes the solecentre of attraction.But as the wheel turns and experience after experience is entered into, thedesire nature reaches satiety and is satisfied, and little by little theformulating of mind images and the production of their effects come to an end.Form consequently ceases, objective manifestation is no longer sought after, andliberation from maya or illusion takes place.12. The past and the present exist in reality. The form assumed in the timeconcept of the present is the result of developed characteristics, and holdslatent seeds of future quality.In this sutra the three aspects of the Eternal Now are formulated for us and itis seen that what we are today is the product of the past, and that what weshall be in the future is dependent upon the seeds either latent and hidden, orsown in the present life. That which has been sown in the past exists andnothing can arrest or stop those seeds from coming to fruition. They must bearfruit in this present life or be concealed until a more favorable soil and moresuitable condition can cause them to germinate, unfold, grow and flower forthinto the clear light of day. There [399] is nothing hidden or concealed whichshall not be revealed nor anything secret which shall not be made known. Thesowing of fresh seeds, and the originating of activities which must bear fruitat a later date is, however, a different matter and one more completely underthe control of the man. By the practice of dispassion and of non-attachment, andby the strenuous control of the desire nature it becomes possible for the man tore-orient himself so that his attention is no longer attracted outward by thestream of mind-images but is withdrawn, and fixed one-pointedly upon reality.This is first attempted through the control of the vehicle of thought, the mind,and the conquest of the modifications of the thinking principle, and then thework of using that mechanism and its employment in right directions and for theachieving of knowledge of the soul-realm instead of the matter realm proceeds.Thus again liberation is brought about.13. The characteristics, whether latent or potent, partake of the nature of thethree gunas (the three qualities of matter).The characteristics are in reality the qualities, capacities and faculties whichthe man is manifesting or can manifest (given the right conditions). These are,as we have seen, the result or the effects of his entire past experience carriedover the entire cycle of lives up to date. The product of the contacts,unfoldments and developments which have governed him from the earliest [400]dawn of his individuality until the present life-cycle, produce what he is andhas, in the present. It must be borne in mind that all these factors which aresummed up under the general title of “characteristics” are concerned with theform and its responsiveness to the indwelling spiritual life.They are produced just as rapidly as the spiritual Indweller can set his impressupon the substance of those forms, bend them to his will, control and subjectthem. Form has certain vibratory activities of its own, inherent in its ownnature. By identification with the form and utilization of it, the Indwellerdevelops a dual set of characteristics. One set demonstrates in the form of thelower self and concerns the adaptability of the form to inner influence, and toouter environment. The other concerns tendencies, impulses and desires whichtend to affect permanently the body of the higher, or causal Self. Hence thesecharacteristics are in both cases concerned with the rhythm or gunas of matter.It might be said that what we are is the product of the past and shows as thecharacteristics of the form of the personality. What we shall be in the nextincarnation is decided by the ability of the true man to influence that personalself, bend it to the higher ends and raise its rate of vibration. Man is onething when he enters into incarnation; he is another when he passes out ofincarnation, for he is then the product of the past, plus the achievement of thepresent life, and that achievement under the great evolutionary urge inevitablyhas carried him forward towards [401] a sattvic or rhythmic, harmoniouscondition, and away from the tamasic condition of inertia, of immobility. Thisis achieved through the imposition of the characteristics of activity, themiddle guna, and that which predominantly controls the outward-going activityand drives the man into sensuous experience.14. The manifestation of the objective form is due to the one-pointedness of theeffect-producing cause (the unification of the modifications of the chitta ormind stuff).The urge towards involution or towards form taking is so dominant and soone-pointedly the result of the egoic thought that it makes objectivemanifestation inevitable. The chitta or mind stuff (in the great process of formappropriation) is so thoroughly unified and the desire to experience throughphysical plane contacts is so dominant, that the many modifications of the mindare all turned towards the same object.When the condition is reversed and the man on the physical plane effects his ownliberation, it is also by the same method, one-pointedness and unification. Theold commentary makes this clear in certain lines found in relation to thesymbolism of the five-pointed star. They are as follows:“The plunge is downward into matter. The point descends, darts through thewatery sphere and pierces into that which looms inert, immobile, darkling,silent and remote. The point of fire and stone unite, and harmony and union onthe downward path are reached. [402]“The flight is upward into spirit. The point ascends, lifting the two behind andreaching out the three and four towards that which lies behind the veil. Thewater fails to quench the point of fire; thus fire meets fire and blends.Harmony, union on the upward arc are reached. Thus shall the sun movenorthward.”15. These two, consciousness and form, are distinct and separate; though formsmay be similar, the consciousness may function on differing levels of being.This sutra should not be considered apart from the succeeding one, whichpredicates the fact of the one Mind, or the one Life being the potent cause ofall differentiated lesser minds and lives. This must ever be realized. Threemain thoughts therefore lie involved in this sutra.First, that there are two main lines of evolution, that which concerns matterand form, and that which concerns the soul, the consciousness aspect, thethinker in manifestation. For each of these the path of progress differs andeach pursues its course. As has been noted, for a long period of time, the soulidentifies itself with the form aspect and endeavors to follow the “Path ofDeath” for that is what the dark path is in fact to the thinker. Later, throughstrenuous effort, this identification ceases; the soul becomes aware of itself,and of its own path, or dharma, and follows then the way of light and of life.It should ever be borne in mind, however, that for the two aspects their ownpath is the right path and that the impulses which lie hidden in the physicalvehicle [403] or in the astral body are not in themselves wrong. They becamewrong from certain angles when twisted from their right use, and it was thisrealization that led the disciple in the Book of Job to cry out and say “I haveperverted that which was right.” The two lines of development are separate anddistinct, and this every aspirant has to learn.When this is grasped, he seeks to aid the evolution of his forms in two ways;first by refusing to identify himself with them, and secondly, by stimulatingthem.Through the bringing in of spiritual force, he will also realize the point inevolution at which his brothers stand, and cease to criticize them for what maybe to him wrong action, but which is for them the natural activity of the formduring the cycle wherein form and soul are identified and considered the same.The second main line of thought involved in Sutra 15 is more difficult toexpress. It lends colour and veracity to the contention of many thinkers thatthings exist and have form and activity only in so far as the mind of thethinker formulates them. In other words, that through the modifications of ourown thinking principle we build our own world, and create our own environment.The inference, therefore, is that (given the one basic substance, spirit-matter)we weave it into forms by our own thought impulses. Others perceive that whichwe see, because some of the modifications of their minds are analogous to oursand their reactions and impulses are similar [404] in some respects. Yet no twopeople see an object in exactly the same way. “Things” or forms of matter doexist; they are created or in process of creation and for them some mind orminds are responsible. It becomes then a question as to who is responsible forthe thought forms by which we are surrounded. Dvivedi’s commentary andtranslation leans more to this second line of thought than does the paraphraseof the Tibetan, and it is of profit to study it, for in the approach of manyminds to a problem, its magnitude can be appreciated, idle and light conclusionsare avoided, and approximation to truth becomes possible. The synthetic point ofview is nearer to universal truth than is the specialized. He says: “Thoughthings are similar, the cause of mind and things is distinct in consequence ofthe difference of minds.”“The preceding considerations establish, in an indirect manner, the existence ofthings as objects external to the mind. The Vijnanavadi-Buddhas who maintainthat things are but the reflections of our thinking principle, would object tosuch a position. The objection could not bear examination, for the existence ofthings apart from the thinking principle is certain. Though there is, indeed,complete similarity among objects of the same class, still the way in which theobjects affect the mind, and the way in which the mind is affected by them, areentirely distinct. Hence objects exist out of the thinking principle. Thoughobjects are similar they are not presented to different minds in the same light,which shows [405] that they are apart from the mind. Again, we often hear morethan one person saying that he has seen the same object as is seen by another.This would prove that though the object is one, the cognizers are many. Thiscircumstance proves the distinction of the object and the mind. Again the seerand the sight, i. e. , the mind and the object or the instrument of knowledgeand the object of knowledge cannot be one and the same, for then all distinctiveknowledge will be impossible, which, however, is absurd. To attempt a solutionof this difficulty by saying that eternal vasana of the form of external objectsis the cause of all our distinctive knowledge is useless, for that which hasalready spent itself cannot become the cause. Hence objective existence must begranted as independent of the subject. Nor should it be imagined how onesubstance (viz. Prakriti) could produce in this case all the multifariousdifferences of our experience, for the three gunas and their variouscombinations in different degrees are enough to account for all that. In thecase of Yogins properly enlightened it is but proper that knowledge havingproduced in them supreme Vairagya they do not care for the gunas, which alsoassume a state of equilibrium and produce no effect.”The third line of thought deals more specifically with the realization aspect,or with the condition of awareness of the indwelling thinker and is therefore ofimmediate practical value to the student of Raja Yoga. It involves certainquestions which might be expressed as follows: [406]1. On what level of being or of realization (for the thought is identical to theoccult student) do I function?2. Do I identify myself with the form or with the soul?3. Which path am I following, the high way of the soul, or the low way ofmatter?4. Am I in a transition period, wherein my realization is being transferred fromthe lower to the higher consciousness?5. Though in the body, is it just my instrument, and am I awake on another planeof awareness?These, and similar questions are of profound value to the aspirant, if askedsincerely and he builds and creates his own environment served truthfully, as inthe presence of God and of the Master.16. The many modifications of the one mind produce the diverse forms, whichdepend for existence upon those many mind impulses.In these words, the whole concept is swung out of the realm of the particularinto the kingdom of universals. We are brought face to face with cosmic andsolar impulses and the smallness and littleness of our individual problembecomes apparent. Every form in manifestation is the result of God’s thought;every objective vehicle through which the life impulses of the universe flow isproduced and kept in objective manifestation through the steady flow of thoughtcurrents emanating from one stupendous cosmic thinker. His mysterious ways, Hissecret hidden plan, the [407] great purpose towards which He is working in thissolar system, is as yet not apparent to man. However, as man’s capacity to thinkin large terms, as his power to visualize the past as a whole, and to unify whatknowledge he has of the life of God as it works through the kingdoms of nature,and as his understanding of the nature of consciousness grows, the will of God(based on loving activity) will become apparent.The clue to the how and the why lies in man’s comprehension of his own mentalactivities. An appreciation of God’s great thought form, a solar system and itsmaintenance, will grow as man comprehends his own thought forms and the way hebuilds and creates his own environment and colours his own life. He constructshis own worlds by the power of his mental processes and the modifications ofthat fragment of the universal thinking principle which he has appropriated forhis own use.The solar Logos, God, let it be remembered, is the sum total of every state ofconsciousness or awareness. Man,—humanity as a whole, or an individual unit—ispart of that total. The many minds, from the mind of the atom (recognized byscience) to the mind of God Himself, through all grades of thinkers and stagesof awareness, are responsible for every form found in our system. As we workfrom the infinitely small to the infinitely great, from the microcosm to themacrocosm, a gradually expanding state of consciousness and a steadilyincreasing condition of awareness becomes apparent. In this scale of development[408] three outstanding types of forms are found, as the result of mind;1. The form of the atom, the true microcosm.2. The form of man, the macrocosm for all the subhuman kingdom.3. The form of God, a solar system, the macrocosm for man and all the superhumanstages.All these forms, with all intermediate forms are dependent upon some life,endowed with the capacity to think, and through thought impulse to modify andinfluence sentient substance, and build it into forms.17. These forms are cognized or not, according to the qualities latent in theperceiving consciousness.This has been translated most ably by Charles Johnston in the words:“An object is perceived or it is not perceived, according as the mind is, or isnot, tinged with the colour of the object.”We see what we are ourselves; we become aware of that in other forms which isdeveloped in ourselves. We fail to see aspects of life because as yet inourselves, those aspects are undeveloped and latent. To illustrate: we fail tosee the divine in our brother because as yet the divine in ourselves isuncontacted and unknown; the form aspect and its limitations are developed in usand the soul is so hidden that we only become aware of the form of our brother,and fail to see his soul. The moment we contact our own soul and live by itslight we see the soul of our brother, [409] become aware of his light and ourentire approach to him is changed.Herein lies the clue to our limitations. Herein lies the promise of our success.Latent faculty, when developed, will reveal to us a new world. The hidden powersof the soul when brought to full expression will make us aware of a new worldand reveal to us a scheme of life and a kingdom of being hitherto negated by us,because not seen. Hence the need for every investigator of the mysteries ofexistence to bring to his search his full equipment, and hence the necessitytherefore for this process of soul unfoldment to be carried forward andpotential faculties to be developed if the truth in its fullness is ever to berealized.18. The Lord of the mind, the perceiver, is ever aware of the constantly activemind stuff, the effect-producing cause.We have in this sutra a statement which is the key to effective and safemeditation work. The one who meditates is the soul, the ego, and his work is apositive activity, not a negative state or condition. Much of the work doneunder the name of meditation is dangerous and useless, because that which seekscontrol is the man on the physical plane, and his endeavour is concentrated onthe attainment of brain stillness. He seeks to quiet the brain cells, and renderthem negative, quiescent and receptive. True meditation, however, concerns thesoul and the mind; the receptivity of the brain is an automatic reaction to thehigher condition. In Raja Yoga, therefore, contact [410] with the true man, theego, and the power to “still the modifications of the thinking principle” mustprecede all brain activity and responsiveness. The Lord of the mind is everawake, ever aware of the tendency of the mind to respond to force currents,produced by thought or desire; he therefore watches every emanation of forceissuing from him, and controls every thought and impulse so that only thosestreams of energy and those impulses originate with him which are in line withthe purpose held constantly in view, and in pursuance of the group plan.It must never be forgotten that all egos work in group formation and under thedirect control of those Thinkers who embody the divine logoic thought. The workevery aspirant, therefore, seeks to do is to bring the brain consciousness inline with that thought which reaches him via his own soul-consciousness, and inthe consummation of this, the divine plan is gradually worked out intomanifestation on the physical plane.As each son of God brings the active mind stuff for which he is responsible intosuch a condition that it becomes responsive to divine thought, then will theplan of the ages be carried to a conclusion. No man need despair because of hisseeming incompetence or apparent littleness for to each of us is entrusted somepart of the plan and we must work it out; without our cooperation there comesdelay and confusion. Sometimes there comes much trouble when a tiny part of abig mechanism refuses to function correctly. Frequently much adjustment isneeded before the complete machine [411] can go forward successfully in itswork, and in the realm of human cooperation an analogous situation is apt tooccur.The constantly active mind stuff can respond to the lower vibration, emanatingfrom the three-fold lower man and to the higher impulse, issuing from the soul,as the intermediary between spirit and matter. The soul is ever aware of thiscondition; man on the physical plane is blind to it or just awaking to the dualpossibility. The work of the aspirant to union is to swing the mind stuffgradually and increasingly under the higher impulse and away from the lowervibration, until the responsiveness to the higher becomes a stable condition andthe vibratory activity of the lower man fades and dies out.19. Because it can be seen or cognized, it is apparent that the mind is not thesource of illumination.This sutra and the two following give us a typical oriental approach to a verydifficult problem, and this method of reasoning is not an easy one for westernminds to grasp. In the six schools of Hindu philosophy this whole problem of thesource of creation and of the nature of the mind is dissected and discussed andso completely covered that practically all our modern schools can be regarded asoutgrowths or logical sequential results of the varied Hindu positions. The clueto the diversity of opinions on these two points may perhaps be found in the sixtypes into which all human beings fall, for the seventh is but the synthesis[412] of them all and inclusive, not exclusive.In the Yoga Sutras , the mind is relegated simply to the position of aninstrument, of an intermediary, of a sensitive plate, registering either thatwhich pours into it from above or that which affects it from below. It has nopersonality of its own; it has no life or light of its own, except that which isinherent in all substance and therefore to be found in the atoms whichconstitute the mind stuff. These latter, being along the same evolutionary lineas the rest of the lower nature, swell the tide of material forces which seeksto hold the soul prisoner, and constitute the great illusion.The mind, therefore, can be cognized in two directions: first, it can be known,recognized and seen by the thinker, the soul on its own plane, and secondly, itcan be seen and known as a vehicle of the man on the physical plane. For a longtime man became that with which he identified himself to the exclusion of thetrue spiritual man, who can be known, contacted and obeyed once the mind isrelegated to its rightful place as an instrument of knowledge.A physical plane analogy may help here. The eye is one of our major senses, thatwhereby we acquire knowledge, a medium through which we see. We, however, do notmake the mistake of regarding the eye itself as a source of light and as thatwhich produces revelation. We know it as an instrument which is responding tocertain light vibrations whereby certain information is conveyed anent thephysical plane to our brain, [413] that great receiving plate upon the physicalplane. To the soul, the mind acts also as an eye or a window through whichinformation comes, but is not itself the source of light or illumination.It is interesting here to note that as the brain and the mind becamecoordinated, (as was first the case in Lemurian days) the sense of sight wassimultaneously developed. As evolution proceeds, a higher coordination takesplace, and the soul and the mind become at-oned. Then, that organ of subtlevision (the third eye) begins to function, and instead of mind, brain, and twoeyes, another triplicity supersedes and we have soul, mind and the third eye.The brain, therefore, is not the source of illumination but becomes aware of thelight of the soul and of what it reveals in the realm of the soul. The third eyesimultaneously develops and admits its possessor into the secrets of the subtlerrealms in the three worlds, so that the brain receives illumination, informationand knowledge from two directions; from the soul via the mind, and from thesubtler planes in the three worlds via the third eye. It should be rememberedhere that the third eye reveals primarily the light to be found in the heart ofevery form of divine manifestation.20. Neither can it know two objects simultaneously, itself and that which isexternal to itself.None of the sheaths through which the soul functions has self-knowledge; theyare only the channels through which knowledge is gained and [414] lifeexperience undergone. The mind does not know itself, for that would predicateself-consciousness, and therefore not having individual consciousness it isunable to say “this is I, myself, and this is external to me, and consequentlythe not-self.” It is simply another sense whereby information is gained and afurther field of knowledge revealed. It is naught but an instrument, as saidbefore, capable of a dual function, registering contacts from one of twodirections and transmitting that knowledge to the brain from the soul or to thesoul from the lower man. This must be meditated upon and the whole trend ofone’s endeavor be to bring that instrument into such a condition that it can beused to the best possible advantage. This is what the three last means of yogaseek to do. As this has been covered earlier it is needless to enlarge upon thishere.21. If knowledge of the mind (chitta) by a remoter mind is postulated, aninfinite number of knowers must be inferred, and the sequence of memoryreactions would tend to infinite confusion.One of the explanations of the functions of the mind is to predicate itscapacity to detach itself from itself and view itself as a thing apart. In thisway, it becomes a confusion of detached parts, remote from each other andleading (as the idea is carried forward to a logical conclusion) to a chaoticcondition. All this has risen from the refusal of orthodox thinkers alongphilosophical and mental [415] lines to admit the possibility of there being anentity, detached and apart from the mind who simply seeks to use it as a meansto knowledge. The problem has arisen very largely from the fact that thisthinker cannot be known until the mind is developed; he can be sensed and feltby the mystic and the devotee but knowledge of him (in the usual significance ofthe term) is not available until the instrument of knowledge, the mind, has beendeveloped. Here is where Eastern knowledge comes in and clarifies the work somarvellously done by the mental and Christian scientists. They have emphasizedthe fact of mind, individual and universal, and our debt to them is great. Thenature of mind, its purpose, control, its problems and processes are subjects ofcommon discussion today whereas one hundred years ago this was not the case. Butwith it all, much confusion remains as the result of our modern tendency todeify the mind and to regard it as the one important factor. Eastern sciencecomes to our rescue and says to us that back of the mind is the thinker, back ofperception, the perceiver is to be found, and behind the object of observationlies the one who observes. This perceiver, thinker and observer is the immortalimperishable ego, the soul in contemplation.22. When the spiritual intelligence, which stands alone and freed from objects,reflects itself in the mind stuff, then comes awareness of the self.This spiritual intelligence, which is the real [416] man, the Son of God,eternal in the Heavens, is known by many and varied names, according to theschool of thought. The appended list of synonyms is of value to the student, forit gives him a broader vision and an inclusive understanding, revealing to himthe fact that the Sons of God, revealed or unrevealed, are everywhere to befound.The spiritual Intelligence. The inner Ruler. The Word made Flesh. The Soul. Thesecond aspect. The AUM. The self-conscious Entity. The second Person. TheThinker. The Christ. God in incarnation. The Observer, Perceiver. The Self. TheSon of Mind. The Form builder. The higher Self. The divine Manasaputra. Force.The Son of God. The Agnishvatta. The Dweller in the body.These and many other terms will be found scattered throughout the scriptures andliterature of the world. In no book, however, is the nature of the soul, whethermacrocosmic (the cosmic Christ), or microcosmic (the individual Christ), sowonderfully portrayed as in the Bhagavad Gita and in the three books, theBhagavad Gita , the New Testament and the Yoga Sutras is contained a completepicture of the soul and its unfoldment.23. Then the mind stuff, reflecting both the knower and the knowable, becomesomniscient.This sutra is in the nature of a summation and emphasizes the fact that themind, being stilled and quiescent through the practise of concentration [417]and meditation, becomes the reflector of “that which is above and of that whichlies below.” It is the transmitter of the knowledge of the self to the physicalbrain of the man in incarnation, and the transmitter also of all that which theself knows and perceives. The field of knowledge is seen and known. The knoweris also perceived, and the “perception of all objects” becomes possible. Itbecomes literally true, therefore, that for the yogin nothing remains hidden orunknown. Information on all subjects becomes possible to him, for he has aninstrument which he can use to ascertain that which the soul knows concerningthe Kingdom of God, the realm of spiritual truth. He can also enter intocommunication and convey to the soul that which is known to the man in physicalincarnation. Thus the knower, the field of knowledge and knowledge itself arebrought into conjunction and the medium of this union is the mind.This is one great stage upon the path of return, and though in due time theintuition will supersede the mind, and direct spiritual perception take theplace of mental perception, yet this stage is an advanced and important one, andopens the door to direct illumination. Nothing need now hinder the downflow ofspiritual force and wisdom into the brain, for the entire lower threefold manhas been purified and dominated, and the physical, emotional and mental bodiesform simply a channel for the divine light, and constitute the vehicle throughwhich the life and love of God may manifest. [418]24. The mind stuff also, reflecting as it does an infinity of mind impressions,becomes the instrument of the Self and acts as a unifying agent.Nothing remains for the spiritual man to do in connection with this purifiedlower self but to learn to use his instrument, the mind, and through it theother two bodies are directed, controlled and utilized. Through the eight meansof yoga his instrument has been discovered, developed and mastered and must nowbe brought into active use, and employed in three ways.1. As a vehicle for the life of the soul.2. In the service of the Hierarchy.3. In cooperation with the plan of evolution.In Book I. Sutra 41, we find these words: “To him whose Vrittis (modificationsof the substance of the mind) are entirely controlled there eventuates a stateof identity with, and similarity to, that which is realized. The knower,knowledge and the field of knowledge become one, just as the crystal takes toitself the colours of that which is reflected in it.” This gives us a picture ofwhat happens to the man who has mastered his instrument. He registers in hisbrain, via the mind, that which is true and real; he becomes aware of the natureof the ideal and bends every power which he possesses to the work of bringingthat ideal into objective manifestation; he sees the vision of the kingdom ofGod as it will be in the latter days, and all that he has and is he renders upin order that the vision may be seen by all; [419] he knows the plan, for it isrevealed to him in the “secret place upon the Mount of God,” and he cooperateswith it intelligently upon the physical plane; he hears the Voice of the Silenceand obeys its injunction, working steadily at the task of spiritual living in aworld consecrated to things material.All this is possible to the man who has stilled the versatile psychic nature andhas mastered the kingly science of Raja Yoga.In the hidden literature of the adepts the following stanzas sum up the state ofthe man who has achieved, who is master and not servant, conqueror and notslave:“The fivefold one hath entered into peace, yet walks our sphere. That which isdense and dark now shineth with a clear pure light, and radiance poureth fromthe seven sacred lotuses. He lighteneth the world, and irradiateth thenethermost place with fire divine.That which hath hitherto been restless, wild as the ocean, turgid as the stormysea, lies quiet and still. Limpid the waters of the lower life and fit to offerto the thirsty ones who, groping, cry of thirst.That which hath slain and veiled the Real for many lengthy aeons is itselfslain, and with its death the separated life is ended. The One is seen. TheVoice is heard. The Real is known, the Vision glimpsed. The fire of God leapsupward into a flame.The darkest place receives the light. The dawn appears on earth. The dayspringfrom on high, sheds its bright beams in hell itself, and all is light and life.”Then before the liberated yogi a choice is placed. He faces a spiritual problemand its nature has been conveyed to us in the following fragment of an oldesoteric catechism: [420]“What dost thou see, Oh! liberated one? Many who suffer, Master, who weep andcry for help.What will thou do, Oh! man of peace? Return from whence I came.Whence comest thou, Pilgrim divine? From the lowest depths of darkness, thenceupwards into light.Where goest thou, Oh! Traveller upon the upward way? Back to the depths ofdarkness, away from the light of day.Wherefore this step, Oh! Son of God? To gather those who stumble in the darknessand light their steps upon the path.When is the term of service, Oh! Saviour of men? I know not, save that whilstone suffers I stay behind and serve.”UNION OR AT-ONE-MENT25. The state of isolated unity (withdrawn into the true nature of the Self) isthe reward of the man who can discriminate between the mind stuff and the Self,or spiritual man.This state of isolated unity must be regarded as the result of the attainment ofa particular state of mind, rather than as a separative reaction.All meditation work, all moments of reflection, all affirmative exercises, allhours of recollection of one’s true nature are means employed to detach the mindfrom the lower reactions and tendencies, and build in the habit of a constantrealization of one’s true divine nature. When this realization is achieved, theneed for such exercises ceases and one enters into one’s heritage. The isolationreferred to is the detachment of the self from the field of knowledge, theinvolving of the refusal of the self to seek outward-going sensuous [421]experience and its standing firm in the state of spiritual being.The man becomes conscious of himself as the knower and is no longer primarilyconcerned with the field of knowledge, as in the early stages of his unfoldment;neither is he engaged with knowledge itself, as during the stage of mentaldevelopment either as an advanced man or as a disciple. He can discriminatebetween all three, and identifies himself henceforth neither with the field ofknowledge, life in the three worlds through the medium of his three vehicles,and the five senses plus the mind, nor with the knowledge gained nor theexperience undergone. He knows the self; he identifies himself with the trueknower, and thus sees things as they are, dissociating himself entirely from theworld of sensuous perception.He does this, however, whilst functioning as a human being on earth. Heparticipates in earth experience; he involves himself in human activities; hewalks among men, eating and sleeping, working and living. Yet all the time he“is in the world, yet not of the world,” and of him it can be said as it wassaid of the Christ, “Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to beequal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form ofa servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as aman, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of thecross.” (Phil. II. 6. 7. 8.) [422]He is at-one with the soul of all, but isolated off, separated from all thatconcerns the form or material nature. The next three sutras should be read asone, giving as they do a picture of the gradual growth of the spiritual naturein the man who has arrived at the state of discriminating detachment, andthrough utter dispassion, knows the meaning of isolated unity.26, 27, 28. The mind then tends towards discrimination and increasingillumination as to the true nature of the one Self. Through force of habit,however, the mind will reflect other mental impressions and perceive objects ofsensuous perception. These reflections are of the nature of hindrances and themethod of their overcoming is the same.The right tendencies and rhythm having been set up, it becomes simply a questionof steady perseverance, common sense and endurance. Unless the utmost vigilanceis exerted, the old habits of mind will very easily reassert themselves, andeven until the final initiation the aspirant must “watch and pray.” The rules which govern victory, the practices which bring success are the samefor the advanced expert warrior and initiate as they are for the humblestneophyte. In Book II. the methods whereby the hindrances and obstacles could beovercome and negated are most carefully given and from the moment of steppingupon the probationary path until that high moment when the [423] last greatinitiation has been experienced, and the liberated man stands forth in the fulllight of day, these methods and modes of disciplined living must be adhered tounswervingly. This involves patience, the capacity to go on after failure, topersevere when success seems far away. This was well known to the greatinitiate, Paul, and was the cause of his injunction to the disciples he soughtto help. “Stand therefore ... and having done all, stand.” James gives us thesame thought where he says “Behold we count them happy that endure.” It is the going on when the point of exhaustion has been reached, the taking ofanother step when the strength to do so seems gone, the holding steady whenthere seems nothing but defeat ahead, and the determination to endure whatevermay be coming, when endurance has been taxed to the limit, which is the hallmarkof disciples of every degree. To them goes out the clarion call of Paul:“Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on thebreastplate of righteousness;And your feet shed with the preparation of the gospel of peace;Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench allthe fiery darts of the wicked.And take the helmet of salvation, and the word of the Spirit, which is the wordof God.” (Eph. VI. 14. 15. 16. 17.)The equally clear command of Krishna to Arjuna sounds out also:“Having regard to thy duty, deign not to shrink back. For nothing is better fora warrior than a righteous [424] battle. And such a battle has come to thee ofits own accord, a very door of heaven will be opened; happy the warriors ... whofind such a fight as this.... Therefore, arise, determined to do battle. Makingequal good and ill fortune, gain and loss, victory and defeat, gird thyself forthe fight.” (Gita II. 31. 32. 38. 37.)29. The man who develops non-attachment even in his aspiration afterillumination and isolated unity becomes aware, eventually, of the overshadowingcloud of spiritual knowledge.It is difficult for the neophyte to be impersonal where his own spiritualunfoldment is concerned. Yet the very earnestness of his aspiration may serve asa hindrance, and one of the first things he has to learn is to go forward alongthe path, adhering to the rules, following the practices, employing the meansand steadily fulfilling the law and at the same time to be occupied with thevision and with service and not with himself. It is so easy to be the victim ofhigh desire and so busy with the reactions and emotions of the aspiring lowerman that rapidly one is enmeshed afresh in the toils of the versatile psychicnature.Non-attachment to all forms of sensuous perception, the high as well as the low,has to be developed.Many people, when they are transferring from the path of feeling and thedevotional heart approach (the mystic line) on to the path of intellectualcontrol,—the approach via the head, the occult method,—complain that the oldmoments of joy and bliss, experienced in meditation, [425] have gone. The systemnow followed seems arid, dry and unsatisfactory. But joy and peace areregistrations of the emotional nature and in no way affect reality. It isimmaterial from the standpoint of the soul whether its reflection, man inincarnation, is happy or not, blissful or sad, contented or in trouble. Only onething matters, the attainment of soul contact, the arriving at union (consciousand intelligent) with the One. This union may work out in the physical planeconsciousness as a sense of peace and joy; it must work out in increasedcapacity to serve the race and to serve it more efficiently. The feelings of thedisciple are of small moment; his understanding and usefulness as a channel forspiritual force are of importance. It should be remembered that on the pathneither our virtues nor our vices count (except in so far as we escape from thepairs of opposites). That alone counts which impels us forward on that pathwhich “shineth more and more until the day be with us.” When a man can detachhis eyes from all that concerns the physical, emotional and mental, and willraise his eyes and direct them away from himself, he will become aware of “theovershadowing cloud of spiritual knowledge,” or of the “raincloud of knowablethings,” as it has also been translated.Here we have, esoterically, and symbolically given, the indication that therelies before the initiate (advanced as he is) a still further progress, anotherveil to be penetrated. He has made a [426] great at-one-ment and has unifiedsoul and body. He stands (as regards the three worlds) at the stage called thatof isolated unity. But another union becomes possible, that of the soul, withthe spirit. The Master must become the Christ and to do this the raincloud ofspiritual knowledge must be reached, used and penetrated. What lies on the otherside of that veil which hides the Father it is needless for us to consider. Inour New Testament , when the Father communicated with the Christ, the voiceissued out of a cloud. (See Matt. XVII.)30. When this stage is reached then the hindrances and karma are overcome.The two verses we have just studied have carried the aspirant on from the stageof adept to that of the Christ.All that hindered, veiled or prevented the full expression of the divine lifehas been overcome; all barriers are down, all obstacles removed. The wheel ofrebirth has served its purpose and the spiritual unit which has entered intoform, carrying with it potential powers and latent possibilities, has developedthem to their full extent and unfolded the full flower of the soul. The law ofcause and effect as it functions in the three worlds no longer controls theliberated soul; his individual karma comes to an end, and though he may still besubservient to group karma (planetary or solar), he himself has nothing to work[427] out nor does he initiate anything which can serve to bind him, by thechains of desire, to the three worlds. His state is summed up for us in the nextsutra.31. When, through the removal of hindrances and the purifications of thesheaths, the totality of knowledge becomes available, naught further remains forthe man to do.The dual work is accomplished. Those hindrances which are the result ofignorance, blindness, environment and activity have been done away with; thegrossness of the sheaths has been corrected and because of this, and throughfollowing the means of yoga, all knowledge becomes available. The yogi is nowaware of his essential omnipresence or that his soul is one with all souls andpart therefore of the one essential unity, the one all-pervading life, theboundless immutable principle which is the cause of all manifestation. He islikewise omniscient, for all knowledge is his and all avenues of knowledge areopen to him. He stands free of the field of knowledge, yet can function in it;he can utilize the instrument of knowledge and ascertain all that he seeks toknow, but is himself centered in the consciousness of the knower. Neither spacenor time can hold him, nor can the material form imprison him, and there comesfor him the grand consummation given to us by Patanjali in his three concludingsutras: [428]“Sutra 32. The modifications of the mind stuff (or qualities of matter), throughthe inherent nature of the three gunas come to an end, for they have servedtheir purpose.Sutra 33. Time, which is the sequence of the modifications of the mind, likewiseterminates, giving place to the Eternal Now.Sutra 34. The state of isolated unity becomes possible when the three qualitiesof matter (the three gunas or potencies of nature) no longer exercise any holdover the Self. The pure spiritual consciousness withdraws into the One.”"},{"pageContent":"THE ARCANE SCHOOLTraining for new age discipleshipis provided by the Arcane School.The principles of the Ageless Wisdomare presented through esoteric meditation,study and service as a way of life.Contact the publishers for information."},{"pageContent":"INDEXAAbsolute principle, 99Abstraction—of spirit out of form, 386process, 282-283See also Yoga, means.Action—rapidity, 352, 353yoga of, 119-125Activity—attribute, 32, 148-149See also Gunas.Adept—creative work, 96, 196, 348distinctive mark, 275free of attachment, 138free of limitations, 356germ of all knowledge, 49physical vehicle, 147power, 196to Christ, process, 426Adoration of devotee, 135Agnishvattas, portrayal, 299-300Ahamkara principle, 128, 158-159Air, purification by, 208Ajna centre, 81, 83, 305Akasha—nature of, 338-339relation to body, 338-339relation to sound, meditation on, 333vidya concerned, 140Akashic record—description, 275-276reading, 275, 276-279Alcohol, use, 381Alignment—of bodies, 226, 232, 368of thinker, mind, and brain, 284process, consummation, 338-339, 353All—knowledge, germ, expansion, 49-51plan or purpose, knowledge of, 34that is, existence for sake of soul, 164All-self, one with, 177All-soul, knowledge and oneness with, 35Alone with himself, 135-136Alta-major centre, activation, 69Analogy, law, 89Angel—of the Presence, 40Solar, 40, 48-49Angels, aid, invocation, 380Anima mundi, 378Annu to atma, 88-89, 345Antaskarana, building, 295Anxieties, concerns, 149-150Apana, concern, 329-330Appearance, relation to subjective happening, 280Appearances, all, reason for, 385Archetype of Plan, 41Archives, Masters, quotation, 286Army of the Voice, 96Aryan—disciple, task, 215initiation, 14line of contact, 43unfoldment, 304-310Word, 56work, 56yogas, ix, 214Ascension out of matter, 338-339Aspect, second, functioning in, 19Aspiration, fiery, 119-125, 187, 189-190, 208-209Astral—body—colours, 349coordination and growth, 305mystery concerned, 216purification, results, 205, 206responsiveness to two types of energy, 216unresponsive, 216consciousness, abstracted, 231dream condition, 86light, mystery, 216nature, subjugation, 331plane—contact with, 274eye on, 253-254nature of 216powers on, 93solar plexus activity, 258Astrological—record, 277significance of right control of prana, 221, 224Atlantean Race, unfoldment, 305-306Atlanteans, path of attainment, 43Atlantis—initiation, xiii, xivyogas, xiii, 214Atma—contact with, 42definition, 319revelation, 43-44Atma-buddhi, effect, 179-180Atmic—body, 23plane, 23Atom—cosmic, 301definition, 363heart, 19of matter, 273of substance, power, 344to atma, knowledge, 88-89ultimate, primordial, 107Atoms—and molecules, assimilation, 202consciousness, 96At-one-ment achieved, 368-369Attachment—definition, 137-139freedom from, 85to objects of pleasure, 135-136Attention—concentrated on unfoldment, 304-310focus at will, 251See also Yoga, means.Augöeides, radiant, 55Aum—concern of student, 338cosmic, 271, 273in all four kingdoms, 275monadic, 337recognise oneself as, 274recognition of sound in others, 275significance, 7synthesiser of aspects, 56use, 56-57, 83word of Father, 338word of human kingdom, 56word of Ishvara, 54-58Aura—freedom from death-producing effects, 285-286reading, 279Auric egg, 292-293Avarice, abstention from, 186, 200-201Avidya—definitions, 127, 131-133prevention of soul vision, 127-134See also Ignorance.Avitchi, definition, 390-391Avyakta, definition, 100Awareness of three factors in attempt to meditate, 259-261BBalancing pairs of opposites.
