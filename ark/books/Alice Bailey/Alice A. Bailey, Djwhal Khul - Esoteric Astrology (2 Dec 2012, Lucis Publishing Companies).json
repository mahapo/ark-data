I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

BAILEY"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I - THE ZODIAC AND THE RAYS[3] What I have to say first on this subject is entirely of a preliminarynature. I seek to lay the ground for a somewhat new approach—a far more esotericapproach—to the science of astrology. Certain things I may say will probably beregarded by the academic and uninspired astrologer as revolutionary, or aserroneous, as improbable or unprovable. As yet, however, astrology has notreally proved itself to the world of thought and science, in spite of manydefinitely demonstrable successes. I would ask all of you, therefore, who readand study this section of A Treatise on the Seven Rays to bear in mind the abovecomments and to preserve a willingness to consider hypotheses and to make aneffort to weigh a theory or suggestion and to test out conclusions over thecourse of a few years. If you can do this, there may come to you an awakening ofthe intuition which will translate modern astrology into something of realmoment and significance to the world. It is intuitional astrology which musteventually supersede what is today called astrology, thus bringing about areturn to the knowledge of that ancient science which related the constellationsand our solar system, drew attention to the nature of the zodiac and informedhumanity as to the basic inter-relations [4] which govern and control thephenomenal and subjective worlds.1. THREE BASIC STATEMENTS.The statement is frequently made that astrology is an exact science but that isfar from correct in spite of the many mathematical computations. Astrology isbased, curiously enough, upon illusion for, as well you know, the zodiac isnaught but the imaginary path of the sun through the heavens, and this as itappears from the standpoint of our totally insignificant planet. The sun is not,as stated, in any sign of the zodiac. It simply appears to be so as it passesbetween our little sphere, the Earth, and the constellations at any particulartime or season.In ancient days it was believed that the earth was the centre of the solarsystem and that around it revolved the sun and all the other planets. This wasthe exoteric knowledge and position, though not the esoteric understanding.Later, when further discoveries brought more light to the human mind, our planetwas decentralised and the truth was more clearly seen, though much remains asyet to be discovered and may even be of as revolutionary a nature. From certainastrological angles, a similar process of decentralisation must take place andthe solar system must no longer be regarded as a point around which the zodiacrevolves or through which the sun passes in its great cycle of approximately25,000 years. Astrologers with insight may deny that this is the commonlyaccepted attitude. Yet—for purposes of clarity and in connection with thegeneral public—the inference is permitted and accepted by the ignorant. Uponthis theory anent the zodiac rests very largely what we call the Great Illusion,and I would have [5] you bear this in mind as you study with me the newerapproaches of this greatest and oldest of all the sciences. Astrology is ascience which must be restored to its original beauty and truth before the worldcan gain a truer perspective and a more just and accurate appreciation of thedivine Plan, as it is expressed at this time through the Wisdom of the Ages.The second statement which I would make is that astrology is essentially thepurest presentation of occult truth in the world at this time, because it is thescience which deals with those conditioning and governing energies and forceswhich play through and upon the whole field of space and all that is foundwithin that field. When this fact is grasped and the sources of those energiesare better comprehended and the nature of the field of space is correctlyunderstood, we shall then see a far wider and at the same time a more closelyrelated horizon; the relationships between individual, planetary, systemic andcosmic entities will be grasped, and we shall then begin to live scientifically.It is this scientific living which it is the immediate purpose of astrology tobring about.At present, the position of the average believer in astrology is that he is anindividual of importance (at least to himself), that he is living on thatimportant planet, the Earth (important to humanity), and that, throughastrology, he can discover his destiny and know what he ought to do. In makingthis comment, I do not refer to those few astrologers who possess real esotericknowledge. They are few in number indeed, and only a handful of them are to befound practising at this time. The modern investigator likes to believe that onhim impinge and through him flow all those energies which come from the sign inwhich the sun “finds” itself at the time of his birth. He regards himself [6]also as responsive to the forces of the various planets as they govern thehouses in his horoscope and he believes that his life trends and circumstancesare thus determined. This makes him feel himself to be a factor of isolatedimportance. Modern interpretations fail to emphasise the importance of therising sign (the ascendant) and this has been due to the fact that few have beenas yet ready to function as souls; small allowance has been made for theenergies which play upon our planet all the time from other constellations orfrom the many “hidden” planets. Of these, the Ageless Wisdom claims that thereare around seventy in our solar system.I desire to give you a truer and more accurate picture. This has now becomepossible because group awareness, group relations and group integrity are comingto the fore in the human consciousness. As this takes place, the personalitywhich is individual, separative and self-centred will recede increasingly intothe background, and the soul, non-separative, group conscious and inclusive,will come more and more to the fore. Interest, therefore, in the individualhoroscope will gradually die out, and increasingly the planetary, the systemicand the universal picture will stand out in the awareness of the individual; hewill then regard himself only as an integral part of a far more important wholeand his world group will interest him far more than himself, as an individual.I shall not, therefore, deal with the subject of esoteric astrology from thestandpoint of the horoscope at all. Universal relationships, the interplay ofenergies, the nature of what lies behind the Great Illusion, the deluding“Appearances of things as they are,” and the destiny of our planet, of thekingdoms in nature and of humanity as a whole—these will constitute the majorpart of our theme.[7] It is immaterial to me whether modern astrologers accept or reject thesepresented ideas. I will endeavour to give you certain facts as the Hierarchyrecognises them; I will indicate, if I can, the subjective realities of whichthe outer illusion is but the phenomenal appearance, conditioned by men’sthoughts throughout the ages; I will emphasise the fact of the livingness of theSources from which all the energies and forces which play upon our planet flowand emanate; I will endeavour, above all else, to demonstrate to you thatall-pervading unity and that underlying synthesis which is the basis of allreligions and of all the many transmitted forces; I will seek to remove you, asindividuals, from out of the centre of your own stage and consciousnessand—without depriving you of individuality and of self-identity—yet show you howyou are part of a greater whole of which you can become consciously aware whenyou can function as souls, but of which you are today unconscious, or at leastonly registering and sensing the inner reality in which you live and move andhave your being.This brings me to the third statement, which is so basic and fundamental that Iwould ask you to pause and contemplate it, even though you grasp not its fullimplications as yet. The Ancient Wisdom teaches that “space is an entity.” It iswith the life of this entity and with the forces and energies, the impulses andthe rhythms, the cycles and the times and seasons that esoteric astrology deals.H.P.B. stated this in The Secret Doctrine . I would remind you that there is anastrological key to The Secret Doctrine which cannot yet be given incompleteness. I can, however, give you some hints and suggest some lines ofapproach, and these, if carried in the consciousness of the illuminedastrologers, may enable one of them at a later date to discover that key andthen—turning it on behalf of humanity—[8] reveal the fourth great fundamental ofthe Ageless Wisdom of which three are already given in the proem of The SecretDoctrine .Space is an entity and the entire “vault of heaven” (as it has been poeticallycalled) is the phenomenal appearance of that entity. You will note that I didnot say the material appearance, but the phenomenal appearance. Speculationabout the nature, the history and identity of that entity is useless and of novalue. Some dim idea, providing analogy even when eluding specifications, mightbe gained if you will endeavour to think of the human family, the fourth kingdomin nature, as an entity, as constituting a single unit, expressing itselfthrough the many diversified forms of man. You, as an individual, are anintegral part of humanity, yet you lead your own life, you react to your ownimpressions, you respond to exterior influences and impacts, and in your turnyou emanate influences, send forth some form of character radiation and expresssome quality or qualities. You thereby, and in some measure, affect yourenvironment and those whom you contact. Yet all the while you remain part of aphenomenal entity to which we give the name of humanity . Now extend this ideato a greater phenomenal entity, the solar system. This entity is itself anintegral part of a still greater life which is expressing Itself through sevensolar systems, of which ours is one. If you can grasp this idea, a vague pictureof a great underlying esoteric truth will emerge into your consciousness. It isthe life and the influence, the radiations and emanations of this entity, andtheir united effect on our planetary life, the kingdoms in nature and theunfolding human civilizations, which we shall have briefly to consider.The subject is so vast that I have been faced with the problem of the bestmethod whereby to handle it. I decided [9] on brevity, the concise statement offacts (facts to those of us who are working on the inner side of life, but whichmust rightly be only hypotheses to you) and the avoidance of detail and ofdetailed discussion. We will endeavour to work from the universal to theparticular and from the general to the specific, but our emphasis will always beon the universal and the general, and not upon the particular and specific. Itwill rest with those of you who are students of astrology to make dueapplication of the truth to the specific. It is definitely in this connectionthat modern astrology has gone astray. It has reversed the true and rightprocedure and has laid the emphasis upon the specific and particular, upon thepersonal horoscope and the individual destiny, and has not laid the emphasisupon the great energies and their Source. These sources are ultimatelyresponsible for the manifestation of the specific. This position andpresentation of truth must be altered.In esoteric astrology we are, therefore, dealing with the Life and Lives whichinform the “points of light” within the universal Life. Constellations, solarsystems, planets, kingdoms in nature and microscopic man are all of them theresult of the activity and the manifestation of energy of certain Lives whosecycle of expression and whose infinite purposes lie outside the comprehension ofthe most advanced and illumined minds on our planet.The next point for each of you to grasp is the fact that the ether of space isthe field in and through which the energies from the many originating Sourcesplay. We are, therefore, concerned with the etheric body of the planet, of thesolar system, and of the seven solar systems of which our system is one, as wellas with the general and vaster etheric body of the universe in which we arelocated. I employ the word “located” here with deliberation and because [10] ofthe inferences to which it leads. This vaster field, as well as the smaller andmore localised fields, provides the medium of transmission for all the energieswhich play upon and through our solar system, our planetary spheres and allforms of life upon those spheres. It forms one unbroken field of activity inconstant ceaseless motion—an eternal medium for the exchange and transmission ofenergies.In connection with this, and in order more correctly to understand, it will beuseful to study individual man; in this way we can arrive at a faintcomprehension of the basic and underlying truth. Students should never forgetthe Law of Analogy as an interpretive agency. Esotericism teaches (and modernscience is rapidly arriving at the same conclusion) that underlying the physicalbody and its comprehensive and intricate system of nerves is a vital or ethericbody which is the counterpart and the true form of the outer and tangiblephenomenal aspect. It is likewise the medium for the transmission of force toall parts of the human frame and the agent of the indwelling life andconsciousness. It determines and conditions the physical body, for it is itselfthe repository and the transmitter of energy from the various subjective aspectsof man and also from the environment in which man (both inner and outer man)finds himself.Two other points should here be added. First: the individual etheric body is notan isolated and separated human vehicle but is, in a peculiar sense, an integralpart of the etheric body of that entity which we have called the human family;this kingdom in nature, through its etheric body, is an integral part of theplanetary etheric body; the planetary etheric body is not separated off from theetheric bodies of other planets but all of them in their totality, along withthe etheric body of the sun constitute the etheric [11] body of the solarsystem. This is related to the etheric bodies of the six solar systems which,with ours, form a cosmic unity and into these pour energies and forces fromcertain great constellations. The field of space is etheric in nature and itsvital body is composed of the totality of etheric bodies of all constellations,solar systems and planets which are found therein. Throughout this cosmic goldenweb there is a constant circulation of energies and forces and this constitutesthe scientific basis of the astrological theories. Just as the forces of theplanet and of the inner spiritual man (to mention only one factor among many)pour through the etheric body of the individual man upon the physical plane, andcondition his outer expression, activities, and qualities, so do the varyingforces of the universe pour through every part of the etheric body of thatentity we call space and condition and determine the outer expression, theactivities and qualities of every form found within the cosmic periphery.The second point I would make is that within the human etheric body there are tobe found seven major force centres which are in the nature of distributingagencies and electrical batteries, providing dynamic force and qualitativeenergy to the man; they produce definite effects upon his outer physicalmanifestation. Through their constant activity his quality appears, his raytendencies begin to emerge and his point in evolution is clearly indicated.This “control of form through a septenate of energies” (as it is defined in theOld Commentary ) is an unalterable rule in the inner government of our universeand of our particular solar system, as well as in the case of individual man.There are, for instance, in our solar system, seven sacred planets whichcorrespond to the seven individual force centres in man, the seven solarsystems, of which [12] our solar system is one, and in their turn the sevenenergy centres of the One to Whom I have referred in my other books as the OneAbout Whom Naught Can Be Said.Much has been given in the occult books of which the average astrologer remainsprofoundly unaware. It is essential that he learns to think in larger Wholes andto be more deeply concerned with the emanating Sources and with the eternalpersistent Causes than with the effects of these Sources upon that ephemeralcreation, a human being and his temporary existence upon a most unimportantplanet. As he seeks to do this, he will discover for himself the signs of theessential divinity of man—a divinity which is to be found in the infinite graspof man’s consciousness when illumined by the light of the soul and in his powerto project his thought into the consciousness of those manifold Lives Whose“energetic movements” he must perforce share because his small modicum of energyis an integral part of Theirs.There is one aspect of energy for which the modern astrologer makes very littleallowance, and yet it is of paramount importance. This is the energy whichemanates from or radiates from the Earth itself. Living as all human beings doupon the surface of the Earth and being, therefore, projected into the ethericbody of the planet (for the reason that “man stands erect”) man’s body is at alltimes bathed in the emanations and the radiations of our Earth and in theintegral quality of our planetary Logos as He sends forth and transmits energywithin His planetary environment. Astrologers have always emphasised theincoming influences and energies as they beat upon and play through our littleplanet, but they have omitted to take into adequate consideration the emanatingqualities and forces which are the contribution of our Earth’s etheric [13] bodyto the larger whole. This we will consider later, but I felt the necessity ofcalling your attention to it at this time.Another point which should here be noted is that the influence of the moon ispurely symbolic in nature and in effect and is simply the result of ancientthought and teaching (descended to us from Lemurian times) and is not based uponany true radiation or influence. In those far off times, antedating even Lemuriaand constituting in Lemurian days simply an ancient tradition, the moon appearedto be a living vital entity. But I would have you bear definitely in mind thattoday the moon is nothing more than a dead form. It has no emanation and noradiation of any kind and, therefore, has no effect of any kind. The moon, fromthe angle of the esoteric knower, is simply an obstruction in space—anundesirable form which must some day disappear. In esoteric astrology, theeffect of the moon is noted as a thought effect and as the result of a powerfuland most ancient thoughtform; nevertheless, the moon has no quality of her ownand can transmit nothing to the Earth. Let me reiterate: The moon is a deadform; it has no emanation at all. That is why the moon is spoken of in theancient teaching as “veiling either Vulcan or Uranus.” This hint or inferencehas always been here and astrologers would do well to experiment with thissuggestion I have made anent the moon and (instead of working with the moon) letthem work with Vulcan when dealing with the undeveloped or average man and withUranus when considering the highly developed man. They would find someinteresting and convincing results eventuate.Students would also do well to remember that the twelve constellations whichconstitute our particular zodiac are themselves the recipients of many streamsof energy coming to them from many sources. These blend and fuse with the [14]energy of any particular constellation and—transmuted and “occultlyrefined”—eventually find their way into our solar system.I would like to call attention, at this point, to some comments I made in ATreatise on Cosmic Fire which are apposite and helpful. I am somewhatparaphrasing:“Astrology is concerned with the effect produced in the substance of the sheathsby the influences, vibrations, etc., of the various planets. These are,esoterically, the influences of the solar centres. The forces, emanating fromthe solar centres, play upon the planetary centres.... This is hidden in thekarma of the Heavenly Man. When true esoteric astrology comes into being, moreanent this will be given. Astrological students are today only learning the ABCof this stupendous subject and are occupied with the exoteric fringes of thatgreat veil which has been thrown wisely over planetary lore.”(A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , p. 1051)The following is a list—incomplete but adequate for our purposes—of the majorinfluences which find their way from far distant Sources into our planetary lifeand produce definite effects upon individual man and humanity as a whole.I. 1. The constellation of the Great Bear. 2. The Seven Sisters of the Pleiades.3. Sirius, the Dog Star. II. 1. The seven solar systems of which ours is one. 2.The seven sacred planets of which ours is not one. 3. The five non-sacredplanets or “hidden” planets. III. 1. The seven planetary centres. 2. The sevencentres of force in the human etheric body. IV. 1. The twelve zodiacalconstellations.[15] We thus have a ninefold energy impact. This is a major chart but it shouldbe remembered that there are other impacts of relative insignificance.To these would be added other streams of energy which definitely play upon andaffect our planetary life, such as those coming from that great star,Betelgeuse, or from Antares and other stupendous suns and solar systems whichare related to the constellations of the zodiac and whose force reaches usthrough these constellations and not directly.Besides these, it should be remembered that technically we should also add theradiatory influence which comes direct to us from the planet, the Earth, uponwhich we live. Then, and only then, can you have a fairly complete analysis andpicture of the energies to which the etheric body of man (conditioning thephysical body which is pre-eminently automatic and negative in its reactions)must and does ever respond. An understanding of that response and the consciousintelligent control of individual reactions are supremely necessary to man butonly become possible at a fairly advanced stage of development and as he nearsthe Path (technically understood). Man learns first of all to control hisreactions to the planets as they rule and direct his personality affairs fromtheir different “stations” in the twelve houses of his horoscope. There are twoways in which this is done:First: By having the horoscope duly cast and then taking [16] steps to determinewhat should be done to negate the planetary influences where it is deemeddesirable to control the personality reactions. This has to be done by theapplied power of thought. This necessitates complete confidence in theunderstanding and interpretation of the astrologer and the recognition of theexact moment of birth. One wonders if these conditions of the exact moment andthe completely wise astrologer are ever to be found as yet.Second: By consciously assuming the position of the spiritual Observer, and bycultivating the power to respond to the Soul. Then, from the angle of that Soul,the man must learn to control circumstance and the attendant reactions of thepersonality.The following attitudes and positions taken by the esoteric astrologer shouldalso be noted:1. That the planetary influences indicate the trend of the outer lifecircumstances. When correctly interpreted for the average man and for theunevolved man, they can and do indicate the personality destiny and fate; theydo condition and completely control the man who has no conscious soulexperience. The moment that a man becomes aware of his own soul and isendeavouring to control his own “path in life,” the influence of the planets,per se, definitely weakens and steadily becomes less and less; his personalitychart appears inconclusive and often most inaccurate. It is the force flowingthrough the planets and not the force of the planets themselves which thengoverns and controls. The man then becomes receptive to the subtler and higherenergies of the solar system and of the twelve governing constellations.2. That the Sun sign , as it is called, indicates the nature of the man,physical, mental and spiritual. It holds the [17] secret of the personality rayand of the man’s responsiveness or lack of responsiveness to the Soul, the realman. It indicates also the integration already achieved and the present point ofunfoldment of the soul qualities, of the present available equipment, of thepresent life quality and of the immediately possible group relations. Itindicates, from the angle of the Ageless Wisdom, nothing more. This is areversal of the usual astrological position. The reason that I proffer this isthat humanity is enough evolved so that the astrology of the soul will becomepossible before long; it constitutes—from many points of view—a reversal ofnormal procedure. This is both wise and necessary, and also inevitable.Astrologers will eventually be divided into two classes: the exotericastrologers who will be occupied with the horoscope of the personality, and theesoteric astrologers who will be occupied with the purposes of the soul.3. That the rising sign indicates the remoter possibilities, and the spiritualgoal and purpose of the immediate incarnation and of the immediate succeedingincarnations. This sign concerns itself with the struggle of the spiritual man“to carry on” from the point achieved so that when the life energy istemporarily exhausted and the “death of the personality” takes place, the manfinds himself “nearer the centre of his life, closer to the centre of his groupand approaching the centre of divine life,” as the Ageless Wisdom expresses it.This particular phrase “death of the personality” has two definite connotations:a. It may mean the death of the physical body, which is inevitably followed bythe two stages of the [18] death of the emotional vehicle and the subsequentdissipation of the temporary and ever-changing form which the quota of mentalenergy has assumed during incarnation.b. The subjective and mystical “death of the personality.” This is a phraseindicating the transfer of the focus for the distribution of energy from thepersonality (a definite centre of force) to the soul (another definite centre).I realise that these concepts are not in line with the usual astrologicalpostulates. However, astrology would not be wasting time if it experimented withthese ideas for a while. Astrologers might discover some most interesting andarresting problems and perhaps arrive at an accuracy which is at presentunknown. It might be of some service if I enlarged somewhat upon this point:In connection with the sun sign, the rising sign and the effect of thethoughtform relating to the moon, the position of esoteric astrology is asfollows:1. The sun sign. —This sign indicates the present problem of the man; it setsthe pace or the established tempo of his personality life; it is related toquality, temperament and the life tendencies which are seeking expression duringthis particular incarnation, and it is suggestive of the rajasic or the activityaspect of the innate man. Fundamentally, the forces here found are indicative ofthe line of least resistance.2. The ascendant or rising sign indicates the intended life or immediate soulpurpose for this incarnation. It holds the secret of the future and presents theforce which, rightly used, will lead the man to success. It represents [19] thesattvic or harmony aspect of life and can produce right relationship betweensoul and personality in any one incarnation. It thus points the way to therecognition of the force of the soul.3. The moon .—This type of force (coming from certain planets and not from themoon) indicates that which is past . It, therefore, summarises limitation andthe present handicaps. It governs the physical body and shows where the prisonof the soul is to be found.The next statement which I would like to make, and which grows normally out ofthe above, is that the zodiacal, the systemic and the planetary energies acteither as hindering or as stimulating forces, according to the type of vehicleor body upon which they play; the nature of these vehicles and their capacity toattract, to respond, to reject, to absorb and to transmute is entirely dependentupon the point in evolution attained and also upon the general planetarycondition and psychology to be found in the human family at any given time. Aninstance of the latter can be seen today in the world where the forces, beatingin an almost violent and somewhat new measure and tempo upon our planetary life,are evoking a greatly intensified response from the world thinkers, thusstimulating them to earnest effort along ideological lines and, at the sametime, are drawing forth from the masses and the little evolved people nothingbut terror, a miserable fatalism, widespread physical depletion and many otherundesirable reactions from the form nature. An understanding of these hinderingor stimulating effects can be easily grasped by those who can comprehend thenature of the activities of the planet, Saturn. This is the planet whichconditions primarily the point in evolution where choice definitely becomespossible, [20] where rejection of opportunity or its acceptance can consciouslybe undertaken, and the shouldering of personal responsibility becomes arecognised fact in a planned and ordered life. This point in the humanevolutionary process is spoken of in the Old Commentary in the followingsymbolic phrases:“Amid the whirling forces, I stand confused. I know them not, for, during all mypast, they swept me up and down the land wherein I moved, blinded and unaware.From place to place and point to point, they drove me up and down the land andnowhere was there rest.I know them now and here I stand and will not move until I know the Law whichgoverns all this movement up and down the land. I may revolve and turning facethe many different ways; I face some wide horizons and yet today I stand.I will determine for myself the way to go. Then onward I will move. I will nottravel up and down the land nor turn in space. But onward I will move.”There is another revolutionary idea which the esoteric science of astrologybrings to its modern and exoteric aspect: In the greater cycle of man’s manyincarnations, he—as is well recognised—passes through the zodiacal circle fromPisces to Aries, thus retrograding through the signs as he follows the sweep orpath of the Sun’s retrogression. This phrase has always disturbed me, but theapparent retrogression, based upon the precession of the equinoxes, is all anintegral part of the Great Illusion. The moment a man begins to emerge out ofthat illusion and is no longer subject to the glamour and to the effect of theworld maya, that moment the motion of the great Wheel of Life [21] is reversedand he then begins (slowly and laboriously) to work in the opposite direction.He then passes through the signs from Aries to Pisces. He begins patiently andconsciously to function as a soul struggling towards the light until finally heemerges at the end of the Path in Pisces as a world Victor and a world Saviour.He then knows the significance of the triumph over death because he hassurmounted and overcome desire.This reversal of the way a man travels through the signs of the zodiac willnecessitate a readjustment of the method employed by astrologers when they arecasting a horoscope of senior aspirants, of disciples and of initiates.According, therefore, to an individual’s point of evolution upon the Path or (inother words) the individual’s place upon the wheel of life, the practisingastrologer will arrange the interpretation of the horoscope. It will require thework and the thought of the intuitive astrologer, dependent upon soul contactand much meditation, to determine the processes of astrological interpretationfor those who are active and living souls at some one or other of the finalstages upon the Path. The casting of the horoscope of the average man or theundeveloped man presents no such difficulties.It might be added in addition that the signs of the zodiac are concernedprimarily with the life expression of the Heavenly Man (as far as our planet isconcerned) and therefore with the destiny and life of the planetary Logos. Theyare also concerned with the great man of the heavens , the solar Logos. I referin this last instance to their effect as it makes itself felt in the solarsystem as a whole and with this effect there are few astrologers at this timefit to deal. I would remind you that to the lives who inform these greatconstellations and whose radiation [22] —dynamic and magnetic—reaches our Earth,this effect is incidental and unnoticed. The primary effect that they have isupon our planetary Logos and this effect reaches us through Him, pouring throughthat great planetary centre to which we have given the name of Shamballa. It is,therefore, capable of evoking the major response from the monads, and thesemonads express themselves through the kingdom of souls and through the humankingdom; it consequently expresses itself through the Hierarchy and throughhumanity as a whole. This is a point of real importance and should be noted andconnected with all the teaching you have had upon this most interesting theme ofthe three major planetary centres. It is the work of the zodiacal influences toevoke the emergence of the will aspect of the Heavenly Man and of all monads,souls and personalities who constitute the planetary body of expression. Thisstatement means but little to you today but it will mean much to those studentswho, in a few decades, will study what I am here saying. Properly understood, itaccounts for much that is happening in the world at this time.As these influences pour through our planet and thence to the centres of forceupon the planet, they produce a dual effect:1. They produce an effect upon advanced man, galvanising the centres above thediaphragm into activity and enabling him to respond to the radiation and theactivity of the Hierarchy.2. They produce an effect upon unevolved man, enabling him to function as anordinary, unenlightened human being.It should be noted here, however, that all the energies—zodiacal, systemic, andplanetary—have a definite effect [23] upon all the lives in all forms in allkingdoms of nature. Nothing can escape these radiatory and magnetic influences.The goal of evolution for humanity is to become consciously and livingly awareof the nature of these energies and begin to know them and to use them. This isthe field of occultism as the Hierarchy has always told men. It might be statedthat the disciple has to become consciously aware of the planetary influencesand begin to use them for the carrying out of soul purpose. The initiate has tobe aware of the zodiacal influences which emanate from outside of the solarsystem altogether. These can be recognised asa. A vibration, registered in one or other of the seven centres.b. A revelation of a particular type of light, conveying a specific colour tothe initiate.c. A peculiar note.d. A directional sound.The whole story of the zodiac can be picturesquely yet accurately summed up inthe following statement: There are three books which the three types of humanbeings study and from which they learn:1. The Book of Life—Initiates—the 12 constellations.2. The Book of Wisdom—Disciples—the 12 planets.3. The Book of Form or of Manifestation—Humanity—the 12 Creative Hierarchies.In summation, it might be said that:1. The zodiacal signs affect primarily the man who lives below the diaphragm.This is the ordinary average man. These signs thus condition four of thecentres: [24]a.The base of the spine.b. The sacral centre.c. The solar plexus centre.d. The spleen.2. The inner group of solar systems, working in conjunction with the zodiacalsigns, affect primarily those who live above the diaphragm. They, therefore,condition:a. The heart centre.b. The throat centre.c. The ajna centre.d. The head centre.3. Three of the energies work through the head centre but only after the thirdinitiation.There are one or two other points which might be noted here also. I note themfor your enlightenment. Out of all the many energies which impinge upon, passthrough and produce effects upon our planet, esoteric astrology emphasises thefollowing four types of force because they affect what might be called thepersonality of our Earth:1. The quality of our solar system. God is a consuming fire but God is alsolove. This is the teaching of both esoteric and exoteric truth.2. The quality of the Logos of our planet as it pours through the chains, therounds, the races, and the kingdoms of nature.3. The quality of the Earth’s complementary planet, which is the Earth’s polaropposite, esoterically considered. This planet is Venus.4. The quality of the attraction of the three planets which produce an esoterictriangle of force.[25] I have several times used the phrase “pass through” the centres and forms.This concept necessitates the idea of distributing centres to which the incomingenergies may go and from which they may pass out again as radiation. Some ideaof this might be grasped if I gave you the new proposition (new to you thoughold to esotericists) of the centres in the human etheric body. The four centresabove the diaphragm—the heart, throat, ajna and head centres—are basically andprimarily receiving centres. The centres below the diaphragm—the base of thespine, the sacral, solar plexus and spleen centres—are galvanised into activityby the four higher receiving centres. This, when accomplished, demonstrates aspersonality and physical magnetism and influence until the time comes when thereis a reversal in the way of passing—as a soul—around the zodiac. This issymbolised as the revolution of the sun around the zodiac from Aries to Piscesinstead of the reverse movement, from Aries to Taurus. This is repeated in thehuman frame and the four lower centres eventually return that which has come tothem. They thus reverse the process normally followed and the centres above thediaphragm become radio-active, dynamic and magnetic. This is an intricate occultstudy and is concerned with the response of the etheric body to the incomingenergies. It relates finally the lowest centre at the base of the spine to thehighest centre, the head centre. This is a correspondence to the relation of theEarth to the Sun. Think this out.As we work and study over these matters, let us bear in mind always the factthat we are considering the seven rays and their inter-relations in the cosmicprocess. We are concerned esoterically with:1. The seven rays and the twelve signs of the zodiac. [26]2. The seven rays and the twelve Creative Hierarchies.3. The seven rays and the planets as they govern the twelve houses ofexpression.As we ponder and think and as we correlate the various aspects of the teaching,we shall find three propositions emerging which govern the inflow of life to theplanet and to the individual man. These have been laid down earlier in ATreatise on the Seven Rays but it might profit us to state them here:Proposition One—Every ray life is an expression of a solar life and every planetis therefore:1. Linked with every other planetary life.2. Animated by energy pouring into it from the seven solar systems, of whichours is one.3. Actuated by three streams of force:a. Coming from solar systems other than our own.b. Our own solar system.c. Our own planetary life.Proposition Two—Each one of the ray lives is the recipient and the custodian ofenergies coming from1. The seven solar systems.2. The twelve constellations.Proposition Three—It is the quality of a ray life—manifesting in time andspace—which determines the phenomenal appearance.Before we penetrate further into the consideration of our theme, I would like toemphasise two points:First of all, that we are considering esoteric influences and not astrology, perse. Our subject is the seven rays and [27] their relationship to the zodiacalconstellations or—in other words—the interaction of the seven great Lives whichinform our solar system with the twelve constellations which compose our zodiac.Secondly, that we have necessarily to study these energies and their interplayfrom the angle of their effect upon the planet, and incidentally, their effectupon the forms in the various kingdoms of nature and particularly in connectionwith the fourth kingdom, the human, and with individual man—average man, thedisciple and the initiate.We shall enter into no definitions in connection with technical astrology, norshall I use the many technical terms. If, in the presentation of this vastsubject, and in the process of indicating the attitude of the Ageless Wisdom tothis new and coming (yet very ancient) “science of effective energies,” as ithas been called, I may present a new approach, or point out an unsuspectedrelation and from the standpoint of the Ageless Wisdom correct what are deemederrors by the Teachers on the inner side of life, I am hoping that someastrologers may be found who will be sensitive to that which is new. I ambelieving that there are investigators along astrological lines who will beopen-minded enough to recognise possible hypotheses and then to make fairexperiment with them. May I repeat: I am not writing a treatise upon astrology,but one upon the seven rays and their equivalent and corresponding energies,upon the effects of ray energy and the interplay of these energies with, andtheir effect upon, the various planetary forces, particularly those of theEarth. I am looking for these fair-minded astrologers to make due experimentwith the factors and suggestions which I may indicate. With this in mind, let usproceed.[28] I have pointed out that these energies fall into three groups:1. Those coming from certain great constellations which are to be found activein relation to our solar system and which, from the most ancient days, havealways been related in myth and legend to our system. To these constellations,ours is related in a peculiar way.2. Those coming from the twelve zodiacal constellations. These are recognised ashaving a definite effect upon our system and our planetary life.3. Those coming from the planets found within the periphery of the Sun’s sphereof influence.From a certain point of view, one can generalise largely and say that these arethe correspondences in the solar system to the three great centres of forcewhich produce and control manifestation and evolutionary progress in the humanbeing:1. The great exterior, yet controlling, constellations are analogous to thatcentre of force which we call the Monad and to its universal will-to-power whichis distinctive of the first divine aspect.2. The twelve constellations might be regarded as embodying the soul aspect and,for the present, their effect upon the individual must be regarded and should bestudied in terms of consciousness and of the development of the life of thesoul. This is in essence the will-to-love .3. The planets, twelve in number (seven sacred planets and five non-sacred), areeffective (using the word in a technical sense) in relation to the externallife, environment and circumstances of the individual. Their force contactsshould be interpreted largely in terms of the human [29] personality, the thirddivine aspect. They thus exemplify the will-to-know .I would have you remember that I am talking entirely in terms of consciousnessand of the responses and reactions of the individual to the forces which impingeupon him. The effect of the emanation of our planet, the Earth, is acorrespondence to the effect of that aggregate of atoms and molecules which wecall the dense physical body and of its response to the pull and the attractionof any or all of the subtler bodies.As regards the influence of the seven solar systems, I should suggest (more Icannot do) that they are linked up astrologically with the constellations, theGreat Bear, the Pleiades, and Sirius. They are intimately related to them, buttheir exact effect is a transmitted one and cannot be noted as producingnoticeable results, as yet, upon humanity and the other kingdoms in nature. Theeffect of the three great constellations also cannot be noted by individual manuntil such time as he becomes conscious of the monadic vibration, after thethird initiation. There are many potent influences playing upon our solar systemand the planet all the time but—as far as man is concerned—his responseapparatus and his mechanism of reaction remain what is called “occultlyunresponsive,” for they are not yet of a quality which will permit anynoticeable recognition, either in the dense or subtler vehicles or even by thesoul. Later in the evolutionary process, recognition and response will come, butfor all astrological purposes and recognisable produced effects, they may beregarded today as non-existent except as they react upon the fourth kingdom ofnature as it constitutes a living unit in the body of the planetary Logos. Aslittle conscious effect is produced by these forces as the effect of a [30] highmoment of contact in your morning meditation produces an effect upon the atom orcell in the little finger upon one of your hands. There may be a generalresponse and stimulation throughout the entire body, but the intelligent atommakes no conscious response. The vibration is of too high a character.Speculation along these lines is profitless. A vast system of interlockingenergies is in active and rapid circulation throughout the whole cosmic ethericbody—of which our systemic etheric body is an integral part—but speculativeresearch along the indicated lines and the following of obscure trails areutterly futile until the main highway of approach has been constructed andfollowed. The general outline of the astrological way is all that is possibletoday, until the time when man can think in larger wholes and has a moresynthetic capacity. We shall confine ourselves to the vast field of energieswhich I have outlined for your consideration and shall consider only the majorforces which are in circulation. This will suffice for our day and generation.We are concerned with energies which can and do evoke response and of which mancan be aware and, in many cases, is today aware.It might be useful here to comment in a wide and general way, and with manynecessary reservations, upon the broad sweep of some of these responses:1. Undeveloped humanity is primarily conditioned in its life and circumstancesby the influence of the lesser zodiac and thus by the position of the planets inthe twelve houses.2. Average intelligent humanity and those nearing the Path of Discipleship andupon the Probationary Path respond consciously to [31]a. The planets, affecting their personalities.b. The Sun sign, as indicating life trends which are already established andwhich constitute the line of least resistance.c. The rising sign in a small measure. This indicates the life goal for thatparticular life cycle or else over a period of seven lives. The last twoconstitute the Greater Zodiac.3. Disciples and initiates can begin consciously to respond to all the aboveinfluences, handling them constructively, plus those potent yet infinitelysubtle forces which pour into our solar system from the three majorconstellations referred to above. In the early stages, the response is in thesubtler bodies and the brain fails to register them, but after the thirdinitiation, there is a recognition of them upon the physical plane.Bringing the theme back to the subject of this treatise, which is that of theseven rays, I would point out that these rays have a close connection with theseven stars of the Great Bear (again always the four and the three as asecondary differentiation) and to the seven Sisters, the Pleiades. The firstconstellation is the agent of positive force to the planetary Logos and theother the relayer of the negative aspect. There is, therefore, a directinterchange of energies between the lives of the seven planetary Logoi and thestupendous and unfathomable Lives Who inform these major constellations. Greatinterlocking triangles of force can be found existing between the seven planetsand these two groups of seven stars each. It will eventually be discovered thatthe innermost secret of astrological deduction in the planetary sense isconnected with these “sacred triangles,” and they are—in their turn—representedby the triangles [32] (shifting and changing) which can be constructed inconnection with the seven centres.In casting the horoscope of the planet (which will some day be possible) it willbe found that the line of these forces and of our planetary response to them isof a more potent effect than is the influence of the zodiacal constellationsupon the human unit. This is due to the immeasurably advanced point in evolutionof the planetary Spirits Who have (in Their individual lives) largelytranscended the influence of the twelve constellations and are becoming rapidlyresponsive to the higher vibrations of their great Prototypes, the “threeintimate constellations,” as they have esoterically been called. This is acorrespondence in the lives of these great Entities to the manner in which anadvanced individual can offset the influence of the planets and thus so dominatehis personality life that prediction and certainty, as to activity andcircumstance, are no longer possible. The soul is dominating, and the planetscease to condition the life. So it is with the constellations and the planetaryLogoi. They can offset the lower influences as They awaken to and respond to theinfinitely higher vibrations of the three major constellations.2. THE CREATIVE HIERARCHIES.It might here be appropriate if I interpolated a chart or a tabulation which maybe found suggestive of some of these interlocking energies which play through,traverse, return, stimulate and energise every part of our solar system. Theyonly evoke conscious response where the vehicle of expression and of response isadequate to the impact, and this statement is true of the solar Logos, theplanetary Logoi, and of all forms in all the kingdoms upon our planet. [33]Unconscious reaction will of course exist, but it will be on a general or massscale, and much of it pours through to us from these distant constellations, viathe fifth Creative Hierarchy. This Hierarchy, being on the verge of liberation,is to be found on the intellectual level of consciousness and can, therefore, beused as a focal point and a transmitter of the higher energies to our solarsystem and to the planet. If you make a careful study of the chart of the twelveCreative Hierarchies, page 34, you will note that this Hierarchy is influencing,and is influenced by, the seventh Ray of Magical Order and of CeremonialOrganisation. The basic function of this ray is to relate spirit and matter andproduce the manifested form. The sign of the zodiac with which it is closelyconnected is that of Cancer, the Crab, which is a mass sign and one of the“gates” into manifested life.The following information anent the Hierarchies may prove useful. It has beengathered from various sources.I might here remind you that the seven planes of our solar system are the sevensubplanes of the cosmic physical plane. The four Creative Hierarchies which haveachieved liberation are now to be found focussed upon the cosmic astral plane;hence their potency even when out of manifestation. The fifth Creative Hierarchyexists on the highest etheric level and will join the other four Hierarchieswhen the sixth Creative Hierarchy has measured up to cosmic opportunity and isitself nearing liberation. The following is a tabulation showing some of theastrological relationships in connection with1. The constellation of the Great Bear.2. The Pleiades or the Seven Sisters.3. Sirius.4. The seven solar systems. [34][Image00004.jpg][35][Image00005.jpg][36] 1. The Hierarchy of Creative Powers is divided esoterically into seven (4and 3) within the Twelve Great Orders.2. Three Hierarchies are—in this greater cycle—of profound significance, thefourth or human Creative Hierarchy and the two deva Hierarchies, the fifth andthe sixth.3. The fourth Creative Hierarchy is in reality the ninth and that is why it iscalled the Hierarchy of Initiates. This can be seen by referring to the chart.4. We are told in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire that in the ninth, tenth andeleventh Hierarchies (counting from the bottom upwards) lies the clue to thenature of Agni, the Lord of Fire, the sum total of systemic vitality.5. Much light can come to the earnest student through a study of the numbersconnected with these Hierarchies.a. The first 5 are regarded as pure abstractions.b. Hierarchy One has the numbers—6.1.7.Hierarchy Two has the numbers—7.2.6.Hierarchy Three has the numbers—8.3.5.Hierarchy Four has the numbers—9.4.4.Hierarchy Five has the numbers—10.5.3.Hierarchy Six has the numbers—11.6.2.Hierarchy Seven has the numbers—12.7.1.It is necessary to take note of this as in The Secret Doctrine reference will befound to the Hierarchies under different numbers. This serves to conceal, but itwill also confuse the student.6. The first four Hierarchies achieved liberation in the first solar system.Their influence reached our Earth through the medium of the fifth CreativeHierarchy. [37]7. These are, therefore, related to the four rays which work as minor rays ofAttribute under the great major third Ray of Active Intelligence.8. Pisces is seen at the head of the list of zodiacal signs because it isgoverning the present great astrological world cycle of 25,000 years. It wasalso one of the dominant signs, influencing our planet at the time ofindividualisation when the human kingdom came into being. It is basicallyrelated to the first or highest Creative Hierarchy which is, in its turn,related to the third Ray of Active Intelligence. It was the product of the firstsolar system. The development of illumination through an awakened intelligenceis the first goal of humanity.9. The fifth Creative Hierarchy (also numbered 8) is on the verge of liberation.It is peculiarly connected with the tenth Creative Hierarchy, with theconstellation Capricorn and with the human personality which veils andtemporarily hides the Christ principle behind both form and mind. Eight is,under some numerical systems, regarded as the number of the Christ.10. The Greater Builders and the Lesser Builders, working on the second andthird planes of our solar system, have their activities reflected in the work ofthe Lunar Lords and the elemental lives.11. You will note that the human Hierarchy (on chart 9-IV-4) is assigned noparticular element as it has to fuse and synthesise them all. This is part ofthe great tests of initiation under Scorpio.12. This chart is drawn up in relation only to the fourth Creative Hierarchy,the human. It is not drawn in relation to the other planetary manifestations.[38] (The chart has been compiled from the very limited stock of knowledge thathas thus far been revealed on the subject, and it is as correct as possibleunder the circumstances.)Each of the seven Hierarchies of Beings, found within the Twelve, Who are theBuilders or the Attractive Agents are (in their degree) intermediaries; allembody one of the types of force emanating from the seven constellations. Theirintermediary work, therefore, is dual:1. They are the mediators between Spirit and matter.2. They are the transmitters of force from sources extraneous to the solarsystem to forms within the solar system.Each of these groups of beings is likewise septenary in nature, and theforty-nine fires of Brahma are the lowest manifestation of their fiery nature.Each group also may be regarded as “fallen” in the cosmic sense, becauseinvolved in the building process, or the occupiers of forms of some degree ofdensity or another.Hierarchy I. The first great Hierarchy is emanated from the Heart of the centralSpiritual Sun. It is the Son of God Himself, the First Born in a cosmic sense,even as the Christ was the “Eldest in a vast family of brothers,” and the “firstflower on the human plant.” The symbol of this Hierarchy is the Golden Lotuswith its twelve petals folded. The Secret Doctrine I. 233-250. III. 565.It should be remembered that this Hierarchy is literally the sixth, for fivehierarchies have passed on, being the product of the earlier system, thatwherein Intelligence or Manas was the goal. The five liberated Hierarchies arein their totality the sum total of manas. It is the Hierarchy which is the fifthin order, and which we are told is in [39] process of achieving finalliberation, or taking its fourth Initiation, which is the cause of certainphenomena upon our planet which has merited our planet being called the “Star ofSuffering.” There is a karmic link between the animal kingdom and the fifthCreative Hierarchy of the earlier system which makes itself felt in man in thenecessary crucifixion of the animal physical nature, particularly along sexlines. We must remember that the Hierarchies work under the Law of Attraction;it is the law of the Builders.This first (sixth) Hierarchy has for its type of energy the first aspect of thesixth type of cosmic electricity , and wields special power, therefore, inconjunction with the lowest fire, or “fire by friction,” as it makes itself felton the sixth plane. These lives are called “the burning Sons of Desire” and werethe Sons of Necessity. It is said of them in the Old Commentary : “They burnedto know. They rushed into the spheres. They are the longing of the Father forthe Mother. Hence do they suffer, burn, and long through the sixth sphere ofsense.”Hierarchy II. The second Hierarchy is closely allied with the Great Bear. We aretold that They entered through the second ventricle within the Sacred Heart, andare (as we are told in The Secret Doctrine ) the prototypes of the Monads. Theyare the source of monadic life, but They are not the Monads; They are farhigher.This Hierarchy, which is literally the seventh, is the influx into our system ofthose Lives who in the first solar system remained on their own plane, being toosinless and holy to find opportunity in that very material and intellectualevolution. Even in this, they will find it impossible to do more than influencethe incarnating Jivas, imparting to them ability to realise the nature of groupconsciousness, the quality of the seven Heavenly Men, but not being able toexpress [40] themselves fully. Some clues to this mystery will come if thestudent carefully bears in mind that in our solar system and our seven planes,we have only the physical body of the Logos, and that that physical body is alimitation of the expression of His threefold nature. The first (sixth)Hierarchy might be viewed as endeavouring to express the mental vibration of thesolar Logos and the second, His emotional, or cosmic astral, nature.This second (seventh) Hierarchy has for its type of force the second aspect ofthe seventh type of force from out of the many. Some idea of the relative pointin evolution of the solar Logos may be gained by study of the varying aspects offorce which He is demonstrating in this particular incarnation. It is thisenergy which drives the Monads through into physical incarnation, for it makesitself felt on the seventh plane. The energies which are functioning are thosewhich the Logos has unfolded, and are the gain of previous incarnations. Gapsnecessarily occur, and certain types of force are lacking because He has as yetmuch cosmically to gain.It is the energy of this Hierarchy which results in the manifestation of theDivine Androgyne, and in the seven centres of force which are the sevenSpiritual Energies.Hierarchy III. The third Creative Hierarchy (or the eighth) is a peculiarlyinteresting one. They are called “the Triads” for They hold in themselves thepotencies of triple evolution, mental, psychical, and spiritual. These Triads ofLife are inherently the three Persons of the Trinity and the flower of theearlier system from a certain angle. From another angle, when studied as the“flower of the earlier Eight,” They are the eightfold points awaitingopportunity to flame forth. They are the devas who are ready for service, whichis to give to another Hierarchy certain [41] qualities which are lacking. ThisHierarchy is regarded as the great donors of immortality whilst Themselves“standing aloof from incarnation.” Lords of Sacrifice and Love are They, butThey cannot pass out of the logoic etheric body into the dense physical vehicle.This third Hierarchy wields the third aspect of electric force of the first typeof cosmic energy. They stand for a recurrent cycle of that first type symbolisedby the number 8. The formulae for these electrical energies are too complicatedto be given here, but the student should bear in mind that these Hierarchiesexpress:1. Septenary cosmic energy.2. Cosmic prana.3. Solar energy or electric fire, solar fire and fire by friction.Each Hierarchy manifests a triple energy or an aspect of each of the above, andthat necessitates a ninefold differentiation, for the two first are triple, asis the third. It is the rejection of the Triadal lives by units in the fourthHierarchy, that of the human Monads, which precipitates a man eventually intothe eighth sphere. He refuses to become a Christ, a Saviour and remainsself-centred.We have dealt with the first three Hierarchies which are regarded as ever“seeing the Face of the Ruler of the Deep,” or as being so pure and holy thatTheir forces are in realised contact with Their emanating source.We now take up for brief consideration two Hierarchies which closely concernourselves, the human self-conscious entities. These two groups are literallythree, as the fifth Hierarchy is a dual one, and it is this which has led tosome confusion and is the occult significance behind the ill-omened numberthirteen. They are the “Seekers of satisfaction” and the cause of the secondfall into generation, the fact [42] behind the taking of a lower nature by theEgo. The fourth and the fifth Hierarchies are the ninth and tenth, or the“Initiates” and the “Perfect Ones.” All human beings, or “Imperishable Jivas,”are those who evolve through a graded series of initiations, either self-inducedor brought about on our planet with extraneous aid. They achieve through a“marriage” with the order next to them, the fifth. They are then completed orperfected, and it is owing to this occult fact that the fourth Hierarchy isregarded as masculine and the fifth as feminine.Hierarchy IV. The fourth Creative Hierarchy is the group wherein the highestaspect of man, his “Father in Heaven” finds place. These lives are the points offire who must become the flame; this they do through the agency of the fifthHierarchy and the four wicks, or the two dual lower hierarchies. Thus it can beseen that where man is concerned, the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventhHierarchies are, during the cycle of incarnation, his very self. They are the“Lords of Sacrifice” and “Lords of Love,” the flower of Atma-Buddhi.In studying these Hierarchies, one of the most valuable lessons to be learned isthe place and importance of man in the scheme. The Hierarchy, for instance,which is the essence of the intangible Life of Spirit, the principle of Buddhi,is the esoteric cause of the cosmic marriage of spirit and matter, based on thelove and desire of the Logos, but each Hierarchy also expresses itself throughone particular manifestation which comes to be regarded by the finite mind ofman as the Hierarchy itself. This is not so, and care must be taken todistinguish between these Hierarchies.They are latent germs of force centres and manifest subjectively; they warm andvitalise groups of forms; they [43] flower forth and express themselves throughthe medium of a form, or another Hierarchy. These Hierarchies are allinterrelated and are negative or positive to each other, as the case may be.As is stated in The Secret Doctrine , I. 238, this Hierarchy is the nursery forthe incarnating Jivas; and it carried in it the germs of the Lives whichachieved the human stage in another solar system, but were not able to proceedbeyond that owing to the coming in of pralaya, which projected them into a stateof latency. The condition of the Hierarchy is similar, only on a cosmic scale,to the condition of the seeds of human life held in a state of obscurationduring an interchain period. The three other Hierarchies dealt with (first,second and third) were those who have (in previous kalpas of logoicmanifestation) passed beyond the human stage altogether. They are, therefore,the arupa or formless groups, as the remaining are the rupa groups or thosehaving forms.The fourth Creative Hierarchy, or the ninth, must ever be regarded in this solarsystem as occupying what might be considered as the third place,First, the Lives or the three Persons of the Trinity.Second, the Prototypes of man, the seven Spirits.Third, man or the lowest manifestation of the self-conscious Spirit aspect.This needs to be carefully considered and has no reference to the form aspectbut solely to the nature of the Lives expressing themselves through other liveswho are also self-conscious , or fully intelligent. This, certain of theHierarchies are not.The four lower Hierarchies are all concerned with manifestation [44] in thethree worlds, or in the dense physical body of the solar Logos. They are Thosewho can discard or pass through the etheric body of the solar Logos and takeforms composed of either gaseous, liquid, or dense substance. The others cannot.They cannot fall into physical generation.Students must bear in mind that from the standpoint of the Logos, the solarAngels on the mental plane (the fifth subplane of the cosmic physical plane) arein physical incarnation, and what is called the “second fall” applies to this.The first fall has reference to the taking of a form of cosmic etheric matter,such as is the case with the Heavenly Men, the prototypes of the human jivas. Inthis latter case the bodies used are called “formless” from our standpoint, andare “vital bodies,” animated by cosmic prana. In the case of ourselves and theremaining groups, the forms are composed of substance of the three lower planes(that which the Logos does not regard as a principle) and, therefore, matterresponding still to the vibration of the earlier system. This means that thefour lower Hierarchies are links between the life of the past and of the future.They are the present. They had not finished their contacts with the activeintelligent principle of the preceding kalpa, and so must continue such contactsin this. They will work out of it in this system, the four will become the threeand they will then be the three higher arupa Hierarchies of the next system.Before continuing our consideration of the particular Hierarchies, it isnecessary to point out that in these Hierarchies, certain of them are termed“dominant hierarchies” and others “subsidiary hierarchies.” By this is meantthat certain of them are expressing themselves in this solar system more fullythan the others, and this necessarily entails [45] the consequence that theirvibration is more to be felt than that of the subsidiary groups. The dominantgroups are the second, fourth and fifth, and this because:a. The second is the great expression of duality, of the Son as He vitalises theSun.b. The fourth is the Hierarchy of human Monads who are the mediators or thesynthesisers; they express the gain of System 1 and the goal of System 2.c. The fifth or tenth is closely linked with the five liberated Hierarchies, andis an expression of their synthesised life. It might, therefore, be said thatthe fifth Hierarchy serves as the representative of the five liberated groups,and the fourth is the representative group in this system, whilst the secondrepresents (for man, or these two groups united) that which is the Spiritaspect, the Father, the Unknown.Hierarchy V. The fifth Creative Hierarchy is, as we know from study of TheSecret Doctrine , a most mysterious one. This mystery is incident upon therelation of the fifth Hierarchy to the five liberated groups . This relation, inconnection with our particular planet, which is not a sacred planet, can besomewhat understood if the history of the Buddha, and His work is contemplated.This is hinted at in the third volume of The Secret Doctrine .The relation of the fifth Hierarchy to a certain constellation has also abearing upon this mystery. This is hidden in the karma of the solar Logos, andconcerns His relationship to another solar Logos, and the interplay of forcebetween Them in a great mahakalpa. This is the true “secret of the Dragon,” andit was the dragon-influence or the “serpent energy” which caused the influx ofmanasic or mind energy into the solar system. Entangled closely [46] with thekarma of these two cosmic Entities, was that of the lesser cosmic Entity Who isthe Life of our planet, the planetary Logos. It was this triple karma whichbrought in the “serpent religion” and the “Serpents or Dragons of Wisdom,” inLemurian days. It had to do with solar and planetary Kundalini, or Serpent fire.A hint lies in the fact that the constellation of the Dragon has the samerelation to the ONE greater than our Logos as the centre at the base of thespine has to a human being. It concerns stimulation, and vitalisation with aconsequent co-ordination of the manifesting fires.A clue to the mystery lies also in the relation of this fifth group to the twocontracting poles. They are the five-fold Links, the “Benign Uniters” and “theProducers of the Atonement.” Esoterically, they are the “Saviours of the Race”and from Them emanates that principle which—in conjunction with the highestaspect—lifts the lower aspect up to Heaven.When these mysteries are carefully studied, and due application made to thelives of the greatest exponents of the at-one-ing principle, it will becomeapparent how great and all-important is their place in the scheme.It is for this reason that the units of the fifth Hierarchy are called “TheHearts of Fiery Love”; They save through love, and in Their turn these lives arepeculiarly close to the great Heart of Love of the solar Logos. These greatredeeming Angels, Who are the Sons of Men on their own true plane, the mental,are ever, therefore, pictured as taking the form of twelve-petalled lotuses—thissymbology linking them up with “the Son of Divine Love,” the manifested solarsystem, which is said to be a cosmic twelve-petalled lotus, and with the logoiccausal lotus, equally of a twelve-petalled nature.[47] We have, therefore, a direct stream of energy flowing through:a. The logoic twelve-petalled egoic lotus, cosmic mental plane.b. The solar twelve-petalled lotus.c. The planetary logoic heart, also a twelve-petalled lotus.d. The twelve-petalled human egoic lotus on the mental plane.e. The twelve-petalled heart centre in a human being.Or, to word it otherwise, energy flows direct from:a. The solar Logos, via three great cosmic centres:1. The central spiritual Sun.2. The heart of the Sun.3. The physical Sun.b. The heart centre of the planetary Logos, situated on the fourth cosmicetheric plane (our buddhic plane).c. The egoic lotus of a human being on the mental plane, which is literally acorrespondence to the “heart of the Sun.” The monadic point is a reflection inthe human system of the “central spiritual Sun.”d. The heart centre of a man on the etheric plane of the physical plane, whichis in its turn a correspondence to the physical Sun.Thus the tiny atom is linked with the great central Life of the solar system.This fifth Hierarchy is equally, under the law, a distributor of energy to thefifth subplane of each plane in the system, only it must be borne in mind that,in the three worlds, it is the fifth subplane counting from above downwards,whilst in the worlds of superhuman evolution, it is [48] the fifth counting frombelow upwards. This Hierarchy wields, as we know, the dual aspects of manas, onein the three worlds and one which makes itself felt in higher spheres.It is necessary to bear in mind that all these groups are (even when termed“formless”) the true forms of all that persists, for all are in the etheric bodyof the solar Logos or planetary Logos. This is a point requiring carefulemphasis; students have for too long regarded the form as being the densephysical body, whereas to the occultist the physical body is not the form, but agross maya, or illusion, and the true form is the body of vitality. Therefore,these Hierarchies are the sum total of the vital lives and the substratum or thesubstance of all that is. We might regard the subject as follows:a. The four superior groups are the Hierarchies expressing themselves throughthe three cosmic ethers, the second, third and fourth.b. The two lowest groups are the lives which are found functioning as theinvolutionary matter (organised and unorganised) of the logoic dense physicalbody, the liquid and gaseous, with the living substance of the four highersubplanes of the systemic dense physical body.c. The fifth Hierarchy has an interesting position as the “mediating” bodybetween the higher four and those which are found on the lower three subplanes.There is a vital and significant correspondence to be found between the sevenhead centres and the seven groups of egos on the mental plane, and there is anoccult analogy between the three head centres (pineal gland, pituitary body, andthe alta major centre) and the expression of these seven groups of egos in thethree worlds. This is [49] a most esoteric fact, and all students meditatingupon the laws of at-one-ment must take this analogy into consideration.It is useful to remember the place of these Hierarchies in the scheme, and torealise that upon the sum total of these vital bodies is gradually gathered thedense manifestation which we regard as the evolutionary matter. The forms arebuilt (from the form of all atoms to the body of the ego, from the form of aflower to the vast planetary or solar lotus) because the Hierarchies exist asthe aggregate of germ lives, giving the impulse, providing the model, andprocuring, through their very existence, the entire raison d’être of all that isseen on all planes.Hierarchies VI and VII. These sixth and seventh Hierarchies which provide thesubstance forms of the three worlds have a vital use and a most interestingplace. From the logoic standpoint, they are not regarded as providingprinciples, but from the standpoint of man they do provide him with His lowestprinciples. They hold the same relation to the Logos as the dense physical bodydoes to man, and all that concerns the evolution of man must (in this particularplace) be studied as going on within the physical, logoic vehicle. They dealwith the display of physical energy; with the working out in the physicalvehicle of all divine purposes, and with the physical organisation of a certaingreat cosmic Life.Particularly is this so when we view the two Hierarchies under consideration.They are the lowest residue of the previous system, and the energy of thatmatter (liquid, gaseous and dense) which the vibration of the logoic permanentatom (on the plane adi) attracts to itself in the building of the divine form.For purposes of clarification [50] and of generalisation, it might be noted thatthe seventh Hierarchy is the life or energy found at the heart of every atom,its positive aspect, and the sixth Hierarchy is the life of the forms of all theetheric bodies of every tangible object. The function of this Hierarchy is welldescribed in the words of the Old Commentary:“The devas hear the word go forth. They sacrifice themselves and out of theirown substance they build the form desired. They draw life and the material fromthemselves, and yield themselves to the divine impulse.”A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , pages 1196-1207TABULATION III[Image00006.jpg][51] Before continuing with the analysis of the tabulations and showing theinter-relations existing in this particular zodiacal cycle between the twelvesigns of the zodiac and the twelve planets, there are certain things which Iwould like to point out here in connection with these zodiacal constellations.They are in the nature of generalisations, but the specific and the particularcan be deduced from them.First of all, I would point out that the twelve planets, governing the twelvehouses, concern primarily the physical plane expression of the man; they affectpotently the personality aspect; their influence, plus inherited karmicconditions, produces those environing states and those circumstances which giveopportunity for the development and eventually the control of the form side oflife.Secondly, the twelve constellations are concerned primarily with the stimulationof the soul within the form, producing subjective activity which, in its turn,causes changes in the outer expression, through the fusion of the energy of theconstellation with the energy of the planets. The effect produced falls into twostages:1. The first stage wherein the sun sign dominates the man and he is graduallyfitted to respond to the soul. His latent possibilities for this life areunfolded. The effect of the sun sign is sometimes called “the potency of the Sunof Probability.”2. The second stage wherein there is increasing response to the energies,concealed by the rising sign. They evoke the unexpected and produce thehastening of the evolutionary process and the unfoldment of the inner life. Therising sign is termed in the language of esotericism “the Sun of Possibility.”[52] Through the effect of the energy flowing from the zodiacal signs the man isprepared for the “crisis of orientation” wherein he slowly and graduallyreverses his mode of progress upon the wheel of life and begins consciously totravel back to his source. He then goes from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus,Scorpio and Capricorn, instead of moving from Aries to Taurus via Sagittarius,Leo and Cancer. The triplicity of constellations mentioned in these two greatroutes around the zodiac have a definite and momentous effect and are called“paramount signs of influence.” During this process the mental principle, thediscriminating mind, is developed and in this specific connection (not in ageneral connection) the emphasis is laid upon the influence of Aries, Gemini andLibra. Under that influence the man learns to overcome desire through experimentwith and experience of every kind of desire and selfish impulse. Thus gradually,and with infinite pain, the human soul learns to function first as a member ofthe human family, and, secondly as a spiritual entity, the divine soul.You will see from the above that certain positions taken by the esotericastrologer reverse the position of the orthodox astrology of today. The reasonfor this is that in the descent of ideas from the plane of ideas, they become“reversed” upon the astral plane and subject to the great illusion; astrologymust eventually free itself from this reversal.A right understanding of the effect of the various energies and forces will makeit apparent that, when the conditioning planetary forces, the expanding energiesof the sun sign and the driving energy of the rising sign are all beingcontrolled and directed by the illumined spiritual man, you will then have asoul upon the very verge of liberation.Eventually the energies of the twelve constellations [53] and—at a final stageof experience and development—of the three great constellations which conditionthe solar Logos are blended with the innate energies of the seven rays or of theseven planetary Logoi. This marks a point of perfection. These extraneousenergies (I refer here to those of the major constellations) are relayed to theEarth via the seven sacred planets and the five non-sacred planets, and whenthere is the complete fusion of the related energies and, therefore, fullexpression, a great world period comes to an end. For a long time during thiscycle of reincarnations and periods of manifestation, the human being isconditioned almost entirely by the activity of the non-sacred planets. These, asyou know, are five in number:The Sun (veiling a planet)The Moon (veiling a planet)The Earth itselfMarsPlutoMan—speaking symbolically—is the “five-pointed star and, at the fiery points,the forces of the man pour out and upon each fiery point appears a centre ofreception.” This is of course pictorially expressed, but the meaning is clear.However, as man nears the Path of Discipleship the influence of the sacredplanets becomes increasingly effective, until after the final and fifthinitiation the non-sacred planets have no effect, though the initiate wieldstheir energies potently as they pour into and through his vehicles of reception,of response and of expression, for all three activities and purposes must benoted.The energies of the twelve constellations are blended with those of the twelveplanets, but their power to evoke response, and to be consciously received,recognised and [54] employed, is dependent entirely upon the type of responsemechanism of the planetary Life and of the individual man. It has been rightlysaid that consciousness is dependent upon the vehicles of consciousness, upontheir point of development and upon the ability of the individual to identifyhimself with the energies and impulses which are reaching him, and is notdependent only upon that which is already a recognised part or aspect ofhimself. It might be said that the higher response to the realities andqualities revealed and made possible by the impact of energy from the zodiacalsigns is somewhat dependent upon the waning influence of the planets to holddown the consciousness aspect of the man. Ponder upon this, for it embodies adeep esoteric truth.Thus, two potent streams of energy—cosmic and systemic—reach man via theconditioning planetary centres of force (the seven planetary schemes in thesolar system and their corresponding seven centres in the planet on which welive) and pour into the symbolic “twelve houses” through their medium. It is forthis reason that our solar system is spoken of as one of “intrinsic duality”(love-wisdom) and that the major task of man is the “regulation of the pairs ofopposites.” The theme of duality, therefore, runs through the whole story ofman’s development. Upon all the three planes of human unfoldment thereconciliation goes forward.1. Upon the physical plane we find the merging of the dense and the ethericforces. This is consummated upon the Path of Purification .2. Upon the astral plane there must come the resolution of the pairs ofopposites. This is consummated upon the Path of Discipleship . [55]3. Upon the mental plane the Angel of the Presence and the Dweller on theThreshold are brought face to face. Their synthesis is brought about upon thePath of Initiation .What is true of man in this connection is true also of humanity as a whole, ofthe planetary Logos of the Earth, as of all planetary Logoi, and of a solarLogos. The analogy between the fusion of the pairs of opposites, for instance,upon the physical plane can be seen in the conscious and directed fusion of theplanetary forces with the energy of any specific planet or group of planets. Theanalogy, involving discrimination to regulate and offset the force of the pairsof opposites upon the astral plane, can be seen when the energies of the sunsign and of the planets are perfectly directed and adjusted. The analogy canalso be carried forward onto the mental plane and when the energies of the sunsign and the rising sign are coherently blended and expressed (in the case ofboth the individual or a planetary Life) there comes a point of crisis whereinthe soul and the personality are brought face to face. The Angel of thePresence, distributing solar fire and holding focussed electric fire, and theDweller on the Threshold, expressing and utilising fire by friction, know eachother “with intimate occult knowledge.” The door then stands open wide throughwhich the life and light of the three major constellations can—after the thirdinitiation—be occultly available to the initiate, be he a liberated human beingor a planetary Logos.When astrologers understand the true significance of the constellation Gemini,the Twins, and the dual forces which pour through this sign (the “forces inconflict” as they are sometimes called or “the quarrelling brothers”) [56] andbeat upon our planetary life, then the true method of resolving the dualitieswill be known.It is interesting to note also that seven of the symbols which express thetwelve signs of the zodiac are dual in their nature, and duality can be inferredfrom them.1. The two horns of the Ram in Aries.2. The two horns of the Bull in Taurus.3. The figures of the Twins in Gemini (two lines).4. The two claws of the Crab in Cancer.5. The two scales of the Balance in Libra.6. The two Parallel Lines of force in Aquarius.7. The two Fishes in Pisces.These seven constellations are, therefore, closely related to six of the sevensacred planets and to one non-sacred planet. There are two signs which aresimple figures and have no significance of duality. They are8. The symbol for Leo, which is simply the Lion’s tail.9. The arrow in the symbol depicting Sagittarius.They embody the idea of isolated separation and one-pointed desire. Two signsare definitely triple in construction and this has a clear meaning to theesotericist.10. Virgo is a triple sign.11. Scorpio is also a triple sign, closely resembling the symbol of Virgo.These two signs are crucial in the experience of the human being, indicating asthey do the function of the triple form and the liberation of the man imprisonedin the form, through the tests in Scorpio wherein he proves to himself and tothe world the reality of that which Virgo has veiled or hidden. [57]12. The symbol for the sign Capricorn is most mysterious. It conceals themystery of the Crocodiles, or Makara. It is constructed in an inaccurate anddefinitely misleading manner and should be regarded as a mystery and thereforenot to be defined.These signs and their relationship to the sacred and non-sacred planets will beconsidered later.To sum up: Man will, therefore, have to be studied as a threefold entity, acomposite individual, expressing (in the three worlds):a. The spiritual soul, reflecting the Monad.b. The human soul, reflecting the divine soul.c. The form nature, which should be the revealer of the two higher.Three Creative Hierarchies condition the man in incarnation, the 4th (or 9th)the 5th (or 10th) and the 6th. These, in collaboration, create man and, at thesame time, constitute the field of his expression. Man is consequently a blendof electric fire, being a divine Flame, and becomes eventually responsive to thethree major controlling influences; he is also solar fire, being a solar Angelin manifestation. He then becomes increasingly responsive to the influences ofthe twelve constellations. He is likewise fire by friction and comes under theinfluence of the planets. The tabulation below may make this somewhat clearer:I. Electric Fire .—Path of Initiation—4th Hierarchy; full soul expression;monadic life.GOAL: Identification with the Monad. Produces responsiveness to the threeconstellations.II. Solar Fire .—Path of Discipleship—5th Hierarchy; full life experience; soullife. [58]GOAL: Identification with the Soul . Produces responsiveness to the twelvezodiacal constellations.III. Fire by Friction .—Path of Evolution—6th Hierarchy; life experiment; humanlife.GOAL: Identification with the Personality . Produces responsiveness to theplanetary influences.3. THE GREAT WHEEL AND SPIRITUAL UNFOLDMENT.Before I give you the remaining part of the chart which deals with theconstellations as conductors of cosmic energies or as transmitters of their ownenergy, I would like to remark that much that I shall say will be based upon:1. The wheel of life and the path of man, the human being, as he passes throughthe signs according to the mode recognised by orthodox astrology. He, as well asthe planets, apparently retrogrades through the signs and appears to passthrough the constellations from Aries to Taurus. But this is all part of theGreat Illusion.2. The wheel of life and the path of man, the divine or spiritual soul, as hepasses through the signs of the zodiac according to the mode studied by theesoteric astrologer. This is the Path of Reality as the other is the Path ofIllusion. This carries the disciple around the path from commencement in Ariesto consummation in Pisces.The present method is based upon the temporary truth that ordinary man issubject to the illusory nature of manifestation and “as he thinks, so is he.”When, however, he becomes Hercules, the Sun God (or solar Angel), he begins toreverse the process (again only apparently) and a definite reorientation takesplace. The Teachers on the [59] inner side, therefore, study the horoscope onlyin its relation to the following three entities:1. The horoscope of the planet itself as the expression of the life of theplanetary Logos. This involves the studying of the horoscope of the spirit ofthe planet as well as of the informing Life and their joint relationship andinterplay. The spirit of the Earth is to the planetary Logos of the Earth, forinstance, what the personality (or form nature) is to the soul of man. The twohoroscopes are superimposed and the “planetary pattern” then emerges.2. The horoscope of the human family , of the fourth kingdom in nature,regarding it as an entity, which it essentially is. This is in reality the studyof two horoscopes, as in the above case; the horoscope of the kingdom of souls,of the divine sons of God upon the mental plane, and the study of the entitywhich is the coherent life of the form side of the fourth kingdom in nature.This is again done by superimposing the two charts. These charts are drawn on alarge scale and on a transparent material of which humanity knows nothing. Uponthese charts are noted the pattern which emerges when “soul and personality arebrought together” and present conditions, possible developments andrelationships, and the immediate future objective appear with clarity.3. The horoscopes of disciples . The Masters do not study the charts of ordinaryundeveloped man. There is no profit in so doing. This involves again the studyof the two horoscopes of the disciple under inspection—one of the soul and theother of the personality. Again the process of superimposition is utilised. Inone horoscope, [60] the new orientation and the embryonic reorganised inner lifewill be noted and studied, and in the other the outer life and its conformity ornon-conformity to inner conditions will be the subject of attention. Thus thelife pattern will emerge, possibilities will be indicated, problems willdisappear, and the immediate next step will clearly show forth.It thus becomes apparent again to what an extent the “principle of duality”enters into everything. It is a shifting dualism, according to where theemphasis may be placed, but this dualism is present until the last and finalinitiation—present in the later stages of the evolutionary process, in theadjustment of form relations but not present in the consciousness of thedisciple of advanced degree. That is the major point to be grasped.A third point must here be made, following upon the two earlier emphasised. Agreat part of our study will be occupied with the relation of the sixconstellations in the upper half of the zodiacal wheel to the six which arefound in the lower half; we shall consider the energy which is a human being(note that phrasing) as it travels anti-clockwise from Aries to Taurus andthen—reversing the process—travels from Aries to Pisces. We will consider thedualities provided by one of these constellations and its opposite; we willstudy, therefore, the great qualities provided by a constellation and itsopposite sign. We will take up these points in the following manner:1. From the standpoint of commencement in Aries until the man—through manyturnings of the wheel of life—reaches the point of reversal and reorientation.The man progresses from the point where, in Cancer , he forms a part of the masswith the mass consciousness, [61] inchoate and unfocussed, and with norecognition of objective (except the satisfaction of instinctual desire) untilin Scorpio he becomes the triumphant disciple, having found himself in Leo .Then comes the Crisis of Reorientation which may take a long time and constitutean interlude of many lives of struggle.2. From the standpoint of the man upon the probationary path, seeking the light,struggling through the signs (as the Old Commentary expresses it whenconsidering this point):“He turns from right to left, and then again from left to right. He revolves ingiddy fashion upon an axis of desire. He knows not where to go or what to do.The sky turns black.”At this point, the sign Gemini begins potently to play its part in the life ofthe disciples, with Sagittarius gradually “piercing the heart with his arrows,and then upon the flight of the arrow, the man reaches Capricorn.” Then comesthe Crisis of Renunciation.3. From the standpoint of the pledged disciple and initiate who traverses againthe Path of the Sun and finds that that which he has discovered himself to be inLeo finds its crown in Aquarius . The separative individual consciousnessbecomes the group consciousness in Aquarius, and he begins to comprehend thesignificance of that basic combination of signs, that “triangle in theconsciousness” of humanity:Cancer . . . . . . . . . . Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Aquarius.Mass awareness . . . Individual awareness . . . . Group awareness. Instinctualconsciousness . . . . Intelligent consciousness . Intuitive consciousness.[62] Then, from the standpoint of achievement in Capricorn , he works forseveral lives around the zodiacal path, descending into the sea of the massconsciousness to become what is called in the ancient books “the Crab, whoclears the ocean of matter which flows around the soul of man,” and eventuallyto become a functioning world saviour in Pisces . He descends into the world ofmen to save mankind and to further the plan. He is then “the fish who swims freein the ocean of matter.”The initiate has always to express, in each sign of the zodiac, the consummationand the spiritual fruit of earlier life experience, world experiment and soulachievement. Selfishness has ever to be translated into living active service,and desire has to demonstrate its transmutation in the purity of spiritualaspiration for identification with the will of God.There are one or two points which must be dealt with in order to enable you tostudy with certain definite ideas clearly formulated in your minds. I havehinted at them in some of my earlier books but it will be of service to refer tothem again and to expand the ideas somewhat. I would have you carry them in yourminds as you read and study.I have frequently referred to the fact that the entire science of astrology isbased upon a non-existent condition. It has no basis in material fact and yet iseternally based on truth. The zodiac is, as you well know, the imaginary path ofthe Sun in the heavens. It is therefore largely an illusion, from the exotericpoint of view. But at the same time the constellations exist, and the streams ofenergy which pass and repass, intermingle and interlock throughout the body ofspace are by no means illusions but definitely express eternal relationships. Itis the misuse of the [63] various energies which has created the illusion. Thisillusory path is consequently as much a reality to humanity today as are thepersonality illusions of any individual. These illusions are due to thepolarisation of the individual upon the astral plane.It is interesting also to note in this connection that—due to the precession ofthe equinoxes—a fourth type of force is brought to bear upon the planet and man,but one which is seldom recognised and given due place in the horoscope. Themonth and the sign, or the place of the Sun in the heavens, do not reallycoincide. When we state, for instance, that the Sun is “in Aries” it conveys anesoteric truth but not an exoteric fact. The Sun was in Aries at the beginningof this great cycle, but it is not in exactly the same position today when it is“found” in that sign.Also it should be remembered that as it is necessary to know the moment of birthand the place of birth in casting the horoscope of the individual, so in orderto have a perfectly correct understanding and accurate deductions in connectionwith the constellation, the planets and our Earth there should be a fixed timefrom which to reckon. That fixed time is as yet unknown in exoteric astrology,though the Hierarchy possesses the needed information and it will be madeavailable when the right time comes. It is the knowledge of this innerinformation which constitutes the basis of the statements which I have made orwill make which will seem revolutionary to the orthodox investigator. There hasto be a constant rectification of the earlier conclusions of humanity and ofthis the outstanding instance is the statement in the Bible that the prime dateof creation is 4004 B.C. This is recognised as an error by modern science but isstill believed by many.I earlier gave a hint upon which definite astrological [64] computation could bebased when I gave the time of the “Great Approach” of the Hierarchy to ourplanetary manifestation when individualisation took place and the fourth kingdomin nature appeared. I placed that stupendous event as happening 21,688,345 yearsago. At that time the Sun was in Leo . The process then initiated upon thephysical plane and producing outer physical events took approximately 5,000years to mature and the Sun was in Gemini when the final crisis ofindividualisation took place and the door was then closed upon the animalkingdom.It has been stated that Sagittarius governs human evolution, as the Sun was inthat sign when the Hierarchy began its Approach in order to stimulate the formsof life upon our planet. Sagittarius, however, governed the period of thesubjective approach.The Sun was in Leo when physical plane individualisation took place as a resultof the applied stimulation.The Sun was in Gemini when this Approach was consummated by the founding of theHierarchy upon the Earth. This is one of the great secrets which the MasonicRituals typify, for the symbol of the sign, Gemini, is the source of the conceptof the two pillars, so familiar to Masons. It might therefore be stated that,symbolically speaking,1. Leo governs the E .·. A .·. degree.2. Gemini governs the F.·. C.·. degree.3. Sagittarius governs the degree of M.·.M.·. up to the episode of the raisingof the Master, and that Capricorn governs the final part of the ceremony and theH.·. R.·. A.·.It is always confusing to the beginner who has not yet a developed and trainedintuition to reconcile the seeming discrepancies and apparent contradictionswhich appear in [65] the teaching of the Ageless Wisdom. This same difficultywill be met with in the science of astrology and some reference to the matter isin order at this point. I would remind you of the occult truism which statesthat interpretation and right understanding are based upon the stage of thedevelopment of the individual. H.P.B. remarked in The Secret Doctrine that forsome people the highest principle of which they can be consciously aware mightbe a very low one for another person. The constellations and the planets whichgovern them may, and do, have one effect upon the mass and another upon theaverage individual man, and still a third effect upon the disciple or theinitiate. As the various energies and forces circulate throughout the ethericbody of our solar system, their reception and effect will depend upon the stateof the planetary centres and upon the point of unfoldment of the centres inindividual man. That is why the various charts and tabulations can differ sowidely and different planets can appear as ruling the constellations. Thereseems to be no fixed rule and the student gets bewildered. Orthodox astrologyposits one set of planetary rulers, and they are correct as far as the mass ofhumanity is concerned. But the disciple, who lives above the diaphragm, respondsto another combination and it is with these that I shall principally deal. Thatis why the three charts here given do not appear to coincide. They are drawn upto express the situation in regard to three groups:1. The mass of people who conform to orthodox and recognised astrologicalconclusions.2. Disciples and advanced individuals, conforming to the conclusions of esotericastrology.3. The Creative Hierarchies, giving the interim situation in this world cycle.[66]TABULATION IV.

Ray 6—Cancer and Sagittarius, through Neptune and Mars.In view of all the above, and starting with the basic fact of the Great Illusionit should be remembered that the [69] accuracy of astrological prediction andinterpretation will be based upon three factors:1. The potency of the thoughtforms which have been built up in connection withthe twelve signs. These thoughtforms were originally constructed or anchoredupon the mental plane by the Hierarchy in Atlantean days and they have steadilygained in power ever since. They serve as focal points for certain forces andenable the individual, for instance, to be in touch with great reservoirs ofenergy which then definitely condition him.2. The intuition of the astrologer. The casting of the horoscope serves to putthe astrologer en rapport with the individual, but this is of small service toeither party unless the intuition and sensitivity of the astrologer is activelypresent.3. The capacity of the astrologer in any specific period to respond to thechanges which are all the time taking place, such as the gradual shifting andchanging brought about by the precession of the equinoxes, or the slow shift ofthe pole of the planet. To this should be added that—as man evolves—themechanism of response or the vehicles of consciousness likewise steadilyimprove. His reactions, therefore, to the planetary influence and to the energyof the various constellations change with equal steadiness and allowance must bemade for this. It is consequently essential that the modern astrologer begin tostudy the point in evolution of the subject, prior to casting his horoscope. Hemust ascertain his approximate place upon the path of evolution. To this end,the study of the rays is most necessary through an investigation as to qualityand characteristics and life objectives.[70] Astrologers will eventually be able to cast the horoscope of the soul,which is sensitive to different combinations of forces to those controlling thepersonality life. The disciple and the initiate respond distinctively to theincoming influences and their response differs from that of the undeveloped manor the self-centred person. This will have to be recognised. Those who “livebelow the diaphragm” and who react to the incoming energies through the mediumof the lower centres will have a very different type of chart to that of thedisciple and initiate. It will require a different mode of interpretation. Ihave referred to this before and would remind you of some of the points which Imade.1. Disciples upon the Path of Discipleship are strongly influenced by Mercuryand Saturn —one bringing illumination and the other offering opportunity.2. At the various initiations, the influence of the planets affects thecandidate in a totally different manner than earlier. Cyclically the energiesfrom the constellations pour through the planetary centres.a. At the first initiation, the disciple has to contend with the crystallisingand destroying forces of Vulcan and Pluto. The influence of Vulcan reaches tothe very depths of his nature, whilst Pluto drags to the surface and destroysall that hinders in these lower regions.b. At the second initiation, the candidate comes under the influence of threeplanets—Neptune, Venus and Jupiter . The three centres—solar plexus, heart andthroat—are actively involved.c. At the third initiation, the Moon (veiling a hidden planet) and Mars bringabout a fearful conflict, [71] but at the end the man is released frompersonality control.d. At the fourth initiation, Mercury and Saturn again bring about great changesand unique revelation, but their effect is very different to the earlierexperience.e. At the fifth and final initiation, Uranus and Jupiter appear and produce a“beneficent organisation” of the totality of energies found in the initiate’sequipment. When this reorganisation is complete, the initiate can then “escapefrom off the wheel and then can truly live.”All this time the energy of the sun (veiling a sacred planet, hitherto unknown)is steadily and persistently reaching the man via the solar angel."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II - THE NATURE OF ESOTERIC ASTROLOGYINTRODUCTORY REMARKS[75] It will be apparent to you after studying the foregoing that one of theresults which should emerge under the impression of this new approach toastrological diagnosis (as far as the individual is concerned) will be the morecorrect casting of the horoscope of advanced human beings—disciples andinitiates. This has not hitherto been accurately possible. It will only comeabout, however, if there is wise and right experiment and investigation.I have posited two sets of rulers for two types of people:1. The orthodox and generally accepted series of planetary rulers for theundeveloped and average man.2. A new combination of rulers and constellations for those upon the Path.It will be necessary to remember nevertheless that there are an infinite numberof permutations possible, of complexities and relationships, due to the vastnumber of possible combinations existing in the path of life of the individualand dependent upon his stage of evolutionary unfoldment. These might be dividedinto three groups through a broad, but necessarily inadequate, generalisation:[76]1. Average and undeveloped man, living below the diaphragm and with the emphasisof the incoming energies and forces focussed either in the solar plexus or inthe sacral centre.2. A large number of people who are in an interim stage, with the energies andforces focussed mainly in the lower centre but at the same time playing quitefrequently through the throat centre and evoking a faint response from the heartand the ajna centres.3. People upon one or other of the final stages of the Path, with the emphasispassing rapidly away from the lower centres into the higher triad and with thehighest head centre in process of awakening. These people also fall into twomajor groups:a. Those who are using the solar plexus centre as a vast clearing house for theincoming energies and who are beginning to work through the throat and the heartcentres, with the goal of completely awakening the ajna centre.b. Those who are using all these centres, but in whom the heart centre is fullyawakened and the triangle of force in the head (from the ajna centre to the headcentre and from the head centre to the centre found in the medulla oblongata) isbeginning to function.When these centres are all awakening, their simplest combinations are thefollowing triangles. The Science of Triangles underlies all astrologicaldeduction as well as the centres in the human body. This you know, but the fourtriplicities of orthodox astrology are only the rudiments of this true science,which lies behind the orthodox interpretations. [77]I. ( 1. Base of the spine. ( 2. Sacral Centre. ( 3. Solar Plexus Centre. II. (1. Throat Centre. ( 2. Heart Centre. ( 3. Ajna Centre. III. ( 1. Ajna Centre. (2. Head Centre. ( 3. Centre in the medulla oblongata.Unfortunately the organising principle is not as simple as the above tabulationwould make it appear, for the emphasis, the focus and the mode of arranging andof vitalisation, and the appearance of these esoteric triangles vary with theray type. This Science of Triangles of Energy underlies the new esoteric scienceboth in astrology and in the science of laya-yoga or the science of the centres.Both this ancient yoga and the still more ancient astrological science have nowto be studied upon a higher turn of the spiral. Up till the present time, theteaching about the centres has been inherited from Atlantean times and couchedin the old forms and formulas which are basically unsuited to our presentgreatly advanced stage of development. The same can be said of orthodox orexoteric astrology. Both these sciences must be reoriented and rearranged, andastrology must be based upon a deeper understanding of the relation of theplanets—sacred and non-sacred—to the centres and to certain prominent “cycles ofpolarisation” emerging as the fore-ordained results of “periods of crisis.” Thislast sentence embodies a basic and important statement of truth. [78]1. CENTRES AND TRIANGLES OF FORCEThere are, as you well know, five non-sacred planets, and seven which areregarded as sacred. These twelve planetary lives (with their own cycles, pointsof crisis and moments of polarisation) are closely related to the seven centres.The five centres up the spine are related to the five non-sacred planets, but inunevolved or average man, are focussed almost entirely upon the astral plane andin the astral body. It should be noted that:1. Two of the non-sacred planets (the Earth itself and the Moon) are connectedwith two centres which in the highly evolved man are not of dominatingimportance:a. The spleen receiving pranic emanations from the planet on which we live andconcerned with the etheric and physical bodies and their physical relation.b. A centre in the chest related to the thymus gland. This centre becomesinactive in the advanced man but has a connection with the vagus nerve, prior tothe awakening of the heart centre.2. Two of the other non-sacred planets—Mars and Pluto—function in connectionwith the sacral centre (Mars) and the solar plexus (Pluto). This latter planetbecomes active in the life of the man who is “becoming alive in the highersense, his lower nature passes into the smoke and darkness of Pluto, who governsthe lesser burning ground, in order that the man may live in truth in the higherland of light.”3. The Sun (standing here for Vulcan, which is a sacred planet) governs a centrein the front of the throat which is related to the para-thyroids and not to thethyroid [79] gland, which is related to the throat centre. This centre in thefront of the throat falls into disuse as the creative period of throat activitybegins. It acts as a “mediator” between the higher and the lower creative organs(between the sacral and the throat centres) and leads eventually to thatcreative activity which is consciously that of the functioning soul. Vulcan wasone of the first creative workers among men. He was also related to “Cain whokilled his brother.” The symbolism underlying these ancient myths will be easilyinterpreted by the intuitive student.Some of the tasks which I propose to undertake in this section of our Treatiseon the Seven Rays are as follows:1. Consider why five of the seven rays express themselves through two sets ofplanets—sacred and non-sacred—and also which centres these two groups of raysgovern. Thus we shall relate:a. The seven centres in man's etheric body.b. The seven centres of the fourth Creative Hierarchy of which the seven racesare the expression.c. The seven planetary centres.d. The seven and the five planets which are the centres of energy in the solarsystem, responsive to the energy of the twelve zodiacal constellations.These planetary centres will be studied from two angles:a. From the orthodox angle.b. From the angle of discipleship and initiation.2. Consider the energies of the three major constellations as they each pourthrough three of the zodiacal constellations, thus forming great interlockingtriangles of [80] force. Thus nine of the zodiacal constellations are involved,and these in their turn fuse and blend their energies into three major streamsof force upon the Path of Initiation. These three streams of force pour through:a. Leo, Capricorn and Pisces.tob. Saturn, Mercury and Uranus (the Moon).toc. The head, ajna and heart centres.tod. The throat, the solar plexus and the base of the spine.It should be remembered that the sacral centre and the spleen are primarilyconnected with the planetary emanation of the Earth itself.3. Consider the three great cosmic Crosses:The Cardinal Cross The Fixed Cross The Mutable Cross a. Initiation DiscipleshipEvolution. b. The Planetary Logos Humanity Kingdoms in Nature. c. CosmicInitiation Solar Initiation Planetary Initiation. d. Spirit Soul Body. e. LifeConsciousness Form. f. Monad Ego Personality. g. Three Initiations TwoInitiations Ordinary man. (Initiates) (Disciples)and the relation of these three Crosses to the twelve planets and the generalsweep of the soul in incarnation.4. Elaborate the subject of the interplay between the three groups of rulingplanets as given in Tabulation VI. These, in the totality of their effects, arethe agencies through which the purposes of God are wrought out.[81] Before proceeding with the more technical aspects of our subject, I wouldlike to elaborate this theme of the zodiac, its story and symbolism from themore philosophical and spiritual angle, giving you the subjective picture ofman's progress as he passes on “the sweep of the sun along the path of life.”This is a technical phrase and refers to the activity of a sun, a planet, ahierarchy or a man, after there has been a “moment of crisis,” resulting in a“period of polarisation,” leading inevitably to a fresh surge and sweep onwards.These three words—crisis, polarisation and sweep—are the basis of cyclic law andgovern the evolutionary process. From the point of view of humanity, the passageof the Sun around the zodiac is apparently a slow and laborious process, takingapproximately (on the plane of time) 25,000 years. From the angle of the innervision, it is a sweep around the Path of Life, taking only a moment of time and“obliterating past, present and future in the radiant glory of the workaccomplished.”2. THE CROSSES AND THE SIGNSWe will follow man from sign to sign as he—in travail and pain—forges theequipment and develops painfully the mechanism which will enable him to arriveat a major moment of crisis in his cyclic life wherein he will begin to freehimself from the path of the great illusion along which he has travelled foraeons from Aries to Taurus, via Pisces and—reversing himself—will begin totravel the path of light from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus. This changingexperience is expressed for us most beautifully in the sixth section of the OldCommentary :“The Cross of many changes (the Mutable Cross. A.A.B.) continues with itswhirling, carrying [82] crucified thereon the form of a man in whom is found theseed of all illusion.But, from the Cross whereon he has been slain—e'en though he knew it not—the manclimbs down and feels his way (with pain and many tears) on to another Cross—aCross of blinding light, of fiery pain, of bitter woe, and yet the Cross ofliberation. It is a stationary Cross, fixed in the Heavens, and guarded by theAngel.Behind the Cross, another Cross appears, but that he may not reach (the Angelguards the way!) until the Bull has rent and torn the man, and then—the lightshines forth; until the Serpent dread has wrestled with the man and brought himto his knees, and then—the lifting up into the light; until the Lion has beentamed, the secret of the Sphinx revealed, and then—the revelation of the innerlight; until the man has lifted up his water-pot and joined the ranks of thosewho are the Water-bearers, and then the flowing of the stream of life will fillhis water-pot and drain the rancid pool and cleanse its source and thus revealthe hidden way which leads unto the innermost light, hid by the final Cross.Then, from the Cross of man, the initiate finds his way, passes the Angel andleaves behind the inner torn veil, mounts the major Cross and passes into day,the final day . The wheel for him stands still. The sun and stars, for him, fadeout. A great light is seen and...”The three crosses on Mount Golgotha were Biblical symbols of these threeastrological crosses, the Common or Mutable Cross, the Fixed Cross and theCardinal Cross.[83] I would ask you to remember that though I shall trace the progress of theman from sign to sign around the zodiacal way, yet there is not necessarily thisordered sequence of travel or the smooth passage from sign to sign as I mayportray it. All souls come into incarnation in the sign Cancer. By this I meanthat the very first human incarnation was always taken in this sign which hasbeen recognised down the ages as “the doorway into life of those who must knowdeath,” just as the constellation Capricorn is ever regarded as another door andis called esoterically the “doorway into life of those who know not death.” Asthe ages slip away, the man passes into and out of all the signs, the particularsign being determined by the nature of the personality ray which itself changes,as you know, from life to life. In those signs he learns the needed lessons,broadens his horizon, integrates his personality, begins to sense theconditioning soul, and thus discovers his essential duality. When he is upon thePath of Discipleship (and here I include the Path of Initiation) occult rumoursays that he then becomes conditioned by the tireless Watcher, the soul, and issubjected (during the final stages of the path) to exactly twelve incarnations,passing one in each of the twelve signs. In them he has to prove himself,attaining great moments of crisis in each of the constellations of the FixedCross in particular. From point to point, stage to stage, and finally Cross toCross, he fights for his spiritual life, in all the twelve houses and all thetwelve constellations, subjected to countless combinations of forces andenergies—ray, planetary, zodiacal and cosmic—until he is “made anew,” becomesthe “new man,” is sensitive to the entire range of spiritual vibrations in oursolar system and has achieved that detachment which will enable him to escapefrom the wheel of rebirth. He has accomplished [84] this by mounting the threeCrosses—the cross of the Personality or the changing form, the Cross of theDisciple or the eternal soul, and the Cross of the Spirit. This really meansthat he has passed through three momentous crises in his life cycle.I. The Crisis of Incarnation . . . . . . . . . . The Mutable Cross The Mountingof the Wheel . . . . . . . . Personality and form life The Cycle of Rebirth inForm . . . . . . ExperienceManifestation of ManhoodII. The Crisis of Reorientation . . . . . . . .

The Crisis of Initiation . . . . . . . . . . . . The Cardinal Cross TheTransfiguration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Life of the SpiritManifestation of DivinityIn our study of the interlocking system of energies, in so far as they affectand condition a human being, the theme of the Three Crosses is of profound andpractical interest, especially as they provide those points of crisis wherein aman steps off the ordinary path of evolution and treads the path of discipleshipor—after the third initiation mounts a third Cross. It will underlie our thoughtand all that I have to say. A steady recollection of the twelve basic energies[85] (five major and seven minor which are in reality, and apart from astralreversion due to the Great Illusion, seven major and five minor) will be ofvalue. These work out into human expression via the Lords of the twelve signsand the twelve planetary Rulers. These twelve basic energies emanate from theseven stars of the Great Bear (transmitted through seven stars of the LittleBear); two of them come from Sirius and three from the Pleiades. This set-up (ifI may use such an unorthodox term) will be the condition of the major solarsphere of influence at the end of the Great Age of Brahma, as it is esotericallycalled. In the “interim or interlude of evolution” (which is the inadequatetranslation of an occult phrase given to a world cycle in the Masters' Archives)these energies are stepped down into forces and are literally sixteen alltold—from the angle of manifestation, I would remind you—and make literally:7+7+2=16=7. In these numbers the mystery of our evolutionary process lies hid.Always, however, the emphasis must be laid upon the Rays of Energy and Qualityas they pour through the zodiacal constellations and the planets. The newastrology therefore is necessarily based upon an understanding of the rays. Thefollowing tabulation is fundamental in its implications in this connection andupon it all that I have to say will be based.Seven stars of the Great Bear are the originating Sources of the seven rays ofour solar system. The seven Rishis (as They are called) of the Great Bearexpress Themselves through the medium of the seven planetary Logoi Who are TheirRepresentatives and to Whom They stand in the relation of prototype. The sevenPlanetary Spirits manifest through the medium of the seven sacred planets.Each of these seven Rays, coming from the Great [86] Bear, are transmitted intoour solar system through the medium of three constellations and their rulingplanets. The following tabulation makes this clear but must be interpreted onlyin terms of this present turn of the Great Zodiacal Wheel (25,000 years):TABULATION VIIIPlanets Planets Ray Constellations (Orthodox) (Esoteric) I.

Capricorn, the Goat Saturn Saturn.It will be obvious to you how much correlating work and how much readjustment ofideas will be needed as the new astrology is worked out into practicalusefulness and eventually substituted for that now holding sway. This newastrology really embodies five sciences: [87]1. The Science of the Rays.2. The Science of Esoteric Interpretation which is carried out through3. The Science of Triangles.4. The Science of the Centres.5. The Science of Destiny.This latter science will be based upon the four previous ones and willconstitute an interpretation of the future which will be founded on a correctunderstanding of the rays—personal and egoic—of the influence of thetriangles—zodiacal, planetary, racial and human. These latter triangles arearrived at by a study of the individual human centres. When all this has beenascertained and worked out in the new style of horoscope which will be laterdeveloped, then the Science of Destiny will be applied and the futureindications discovered. Of this, the personal progressed horoscope is theembryonic seed.Some indication of relative values can be gained by a consideration of the humantriangles as given in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , which suggested the following:“It would repay the student to contemplate the interesting succession oftriangles that are to be found and the way in which they must be linked by theprogression of the fire before that fire can perfectly vivify them, and thencepass on to other transmutations. We might enumerate some of these triangles,bearing always in mind that, according to the ray, so will proceed the geometricrising of the fire, and according to the ray, so will the points be touched inordered sequence. Herein lies one of the secrets of initiation, and herein arefound some of the dangers entailed in a too quick publication of informationconcerning the rays. [88]1. The pranic triangle.a. The shoulder centre.b. The centre near the diaphragm.c. The spleen.2. Man controlled from the astral plane.a. The base of spine.b. The solar plexus.c. The heart.3. Man controlled from the mental plane.a. The base of spine.b. The heart.c. The throat.4. Man partially controlled by the Ego, advanced man.a. The heart.b. The throat.c. The head, i.e., the four lesser centres and their synthesis, the ajna centre.5. Spiritual man to the third Initiation.a. The heart.b. The throat.c. The seven head centres.6. Spiritual man to the fifth Initiation.a. The heart.b. The seven head centres.c. The two many-petalled lotuses.All these different periods show different triangular radiations. We must notinfer from this that when the fire is centred in one triangle it is notdemonstrating in others. Once the fire has free passage along any triangle itflames continuously, but always there is one triangle more radiant and luminousthan the others, and it is from these glowing triangles of light, issuing fromwheels and vortices of fire, [89] that the clairvoyant and the teachers of therace can appraise a man's position in the scheme of things, and judge of hisattainment. At the culmination of life experience, and when man has reached hisgoal, each triangle is a radiant path of fire, and each centre a wheel of livingfiery force rotating at terrific speed; the centre at this stage not onlyrotates in a specific direction, but literally turns upon itself, forming aliving flaming iridescent globe of pure fire, and holding within it a certaingeometrical shape, yet withal vibrating so rapidly that the eye can scarcelyfollow it. Above all, at the top of the head will be seen a fiery display thatseems to put all the other centres into insignificance; from the heart of thismany-petalled lotus issues a flame of fire with the basic hue of a man's ray.This flame mounts upward and seems to attract downward a sheet of electriclight, which is the downflow from the spirit on the highest plane. This marksthe blending of the fires and the deliverance of man from the trammels ofmatter.”A Treatise on Cosmic Fire (pp. 169-171)At present, charts are set up on the basis of the personality condition or ofthe personality ray, if the astrologer is fortunate enough to know or to guessit accurately; if, however, the subject is an advanced person, then the chartwill be frequently wrong as the planets which govern in the case of ordinary orundeveloped man have ceased to influence the spiritual man and the disciple.Average man is primarily conditioned in the events of his physical plane life bythe position of the planets in the twelve houses and they are, in their turn,conditioned by certain karmic influences which the advanced man has overcome, oris overcoming. The horoscope will be cast eventually on the basis of the soulray, and then the zodiacal signs which govern the activities and [90] theinfluence of the present group of planetary Rulers will be considerablylessened. New planetary potencies (conveying zodiacal energies) will control andtake precedence of the old ones, thus putting the man in touch with differentforces. Finally the time will come when he will be sensitive to the whole rangeof vibrations; charts will then be set up which will be called “charts of thecrosses” and not simply indications of planetary influences in the twelvehouses. I question whether there is any living astrologer capable of doing thisas yet. These are the kind of charts by which the Masters gauge Their disciplesand they are most interesting; I touched upon them somewhat earlier in thistreatise. These “charts of the crosses” are the ones that are prepared prior tothe third initiation, at which time the man begins his “approach” to theCardinal Cross of the heavens. I would here remind you, e'en though it is apiece of useless information, that the fifth major initiation of our planet isthe first cosmic initiation, just as the third initiation is the first systemic.The two first initiations are planetary in their implications. The abovestatement has deep and esoteric astrological significance.3. SPIRITUAL EFFECTS OF THE ZODIACAL CONSTELLATIONS.I am now going to outline to you the spiritual effect of the passage of a soularound the wheel of experience. We will attempt to consider, in the case of eachconstellation, the general effect upon a soul—undergoing the experience—from theorthodox angle as he travels from Aries to Taurus, via Pisces, and then—as thedisciple, coming under other influences—travels from Aries to Pisces, viaTaurus. Thus the usual process is reversed and the man reorients himself and“faces the East,” as it is esoterically called. He expresses [91] then in thehighest possible manner the qualities of his soul ray as, in the first case, heexpressed the quality of the personality ray.It is not possible for me to be more specific. I seek only to give certainspiritual implications and hints and to convey a general idea of the effect ofthe great illusion upon resultant conditions and, secondly, the result of thegreat tests which every disciple eventually undergoes as he reverses the wheelof life.ARIES, THE RAMStrictly speaking, what I have to say now concerns the pure first ray typebecause Aries is the zodiacal sign through which the first Ray of Will or Powerreaches our planetary life . Such pure types are rare indeed and at this periodof evolution well-nigh unknown. Most people are governed by their personalityray and as the present first ray types are expressing themselves throughpersonalities which are on all the rays, I would simply ask you to consider whatI have to say from the angle of character effects, of problems presented and ofquality unfolded. It is well nigh impossible to be more explicit until such timeas the Science of the Rays has been further developed; the astrologer mustascertain the ray type before he will be able to cast the adequate horoscope ofthe soul. My remarks are therefore general and not specific and are universaland not particular. I impose no doctrine. I indicate phases of speculation whichmight prove illuminating and fruitful.Aries is one of the constellations of the Cardinal Cross of the heavens. This isthe cross of God, the Father, and, therefore, of the incarnating monad. It isthe expression of will or power as it expresses itself through the greatcreative process. When the initiate (as we shall later [92] see) transfershimself on to the Cardinal Cross from which he descended when coming intoincarnation and mounted in its place the Common or Mutable Cross, he no longeridentifies himself with form or even with soul, but with the will of divinityand with the eternal plan and purpose. It becomes his plan and purpose. He knowsno other in a sense which is unknown even to an initiate of the third degree. Hethen enters into the council chamber of God; he becomes a part of the conclaveat Shamballa; he functions no longer simply as a member of the Hierarchy uponthe mental plane. He can now function through all the three worldcentres—Humanity, the Hierarchy and Shamballa.Aries initiates the cycle of manifestation. All souls, as individual entities,come into human incarnation for the first time in the sign of Cancer , emergingas mental entities in the sign Aries, as emotional-desire entities in the signTaurus and as vital entities in the sign Gemini, taking then physical form inCancer . This is an involutionary, subjective cycle. Thus they emerge into theocean of physical plane existence, into the world of matter. Yet the firstimpulse is awakened in Aries, for Aries is the place where the initial idea toinstitute activity takes form. It is the birthplace of ideas, and a true idea isin reality a spiritual impulse taking form—subjective and objective. Thereoriginates the response of the soul to the highest aspect or quality of deitybecause there appears the “will to incarnate.” The first ray aspect of theMonad, responding to the first aspect of deity, evokes response from the firstray aspect of the soul and the first step towards incarnation is taken on thatplane in the system which is the mental plane. Aries “awakens the will to reachthe lowest and there control, to know the uttermost and thus to face allexperience”—thus runs an ancient statement.[93] The keynotes of the sign Aries are four in number, all conveying the sameidea. They can be expressed in the following four injunctions which are given,symbolically, to the incarnating soul:1. Express the will to be and do.2. Unfold the power to manifest.3. Enter into battle for the Lord.4. Arrive at unity through effort.Creation—Being—Activity—Strife—Synthesis, these are the nature of the Lord ofthe first constellation and enable Him to influence our planet to these results.And thus the great cycle of struggle towards expression starts and thefoundational words of The Secret Doctrine , with which you are all so familiar,expresses the goal and the purpose of the first sign of the Cardinal Cross:“Matter is the vehicle for the manifestation of soul on this plane of existence,and soul is the vehicle on a higher plane for the manifestation of spirit, andthese three are a trinity synthesised by life which pervades them all.”—S.D. I.80.What appears in Aries as spiritual energy enters into the soul stage in Cancer ,in which sign the soul incarnates for the first time in form, reaches a point ofequilibrium in Libra , in which sign soul and personality achieve a balance ofcooperation and, in Capricorn , the will nature arrives at fulfilment and avisioned goal is reached. In Capricorn , the man reaches either the height ofpersonal ambition or he becomes the initiate, attaining his spiritual objective.The difference between these two goals depends upon the mode of progressionaround the wheel of life. It should be remembered—generalising again andspeaking symbolically—that the Crosses also turn, being the spokes of the great[94] wheel. The undeveloped man goes from Aries to Capricorn and to Libra andCancer, whilst the developed man reverses the process. We could, for the sake ofclarity, consider the great experience of life as taking place upon the threewheels within the wheel of Life, viewing it from three angles:I. 1. The Wheel of Incarnation. 2. The cycle of ordinary evolution. 3. Theperiod of captivity, wherein the man is bound upon the wheel. 4. The fourfoldinfluence of the Common Cross . 5. Life in the three worlds. 6. The developmentof personality. II. 1. The Wheel adjusted or reversed . 2. The cycle ofdiscipleship. 3. The period of emergence, wherein the man alters the revolutionof the wheel. 4. The fourfold influence of the Fixed Cross . 5. Life in the fiveworlds of superhuman evolution. 6. The unfoldment of soul through thepersonality. III. 1. The wheel controlled or dominated. 2. The cycle ofinitiation. 3. The period of liberation from the work of the Great Wheel. 4. Thefourfold influence of the Cardinal Cross. 5. Life in the seven worlds of ourseven planes. 6. Fusion of spirit, soul and personality.Aries, therefore, starts the process of the “most ancient initiation” which allthe human family has already undergone [95] and will undergo. The first greatcosmic initiation (as far as humanity is concerned) is initiation intoincarnation—the initiation of individualisation. This process culminates aeonslater in the reversing of the wheel and the attaining of a definite goal inCapricorn. It culminates in the achievement of transference from off the FixedCross on to the Cardinal Cross, which is, in its turn, the logical sequence ofthe transference from off the Mutable or Common Cross on to the Fixed Cross.Therefore, in its lowest manifestation, Aries is the creator of thoseactivities, conditions and processes which lead to the manifestation of soulthrough the medium of form, and later of those higher creative undertakingswhich lead in due time to the manifestation of spirit through the soul. Theseprocesses eventually demonstrate the true nature of the triplicity to which Iintroduced you in the earlier pages of this treatise: Life—Quality—Appearance.Aries is also the purveyor to our solar system of Fire (Electric Fire) and ofthe dynamic nature of God which has in it the qualities of fostering andnourishing heat and also of the fire which burns and destroys. From thestandpoint of esoteric astrology, there are three major signs in which the“three deaths” are undergone:1. Aries , which at different points along the Path of Life forces the soul onto the burning ground and subjects it to a purifying process during incarnation.Through the lesser fire of mind, the “jungles of experience are set on fire anddissolve in flames and then the Path stands clear and unobstructed vision isachieved.” — Old Commentary Through the fiery processes of war and strife, brought to the individualthrough the influence of the planetary [96] ruler, Mars, the God of War, aneeded purification takes place. The same purification, but this time throughvision, comes to the developed man through the activity of the subjective rulerof the planet, Mercury, who is the illuminating principle which releases themind, directs the way of man through life and enables him to become aware of thedivine Plan which underlies all his fiery experience.2. Scorpio , which brings about eventually the death of the personality and withwhich we shall later deal when we come to consider that sign. Esoterically aswell as exoterically, Scorpio is the sign of death and burial in the earth, ofdescent into the depths in order to be lifted again on to the heights (themountain top in Capricorn ). It is stated in some of the most ancient books that“the heat of the earth, the mother, and the sting of the scorpion are thebeneficent gifts which the turning of the wheel gives to the man at thebeginning and the end.” These gifts, when accepted and used, bring a man toliberation and eventually from the control and pain of the Fixed Cross.3. Pisces sees the relinquishing or the death of all the influences which holdthe man to the wheel of birth and his release from the control of the Common orMutable Cross.It is interesting to note that each of these three signs of death is to be foundin a different cross:1. Aries . . . . . . .The cardinal cross2. Scorpio . . . . .The fixed cross3. Pisces . . . . . .The mutable crossIt is the influence of these three which brings about the [97] “three needed anddetermined deaths” in the life of the human being. I am here referring to thesigns, independently of their planetary rulers. There is something in the energywhich pours in through these signs which pre-determines a crystallising processand the eventual destruction of some type of form control. The Old Commentaryexpresses these ideas in the following terms:“The fire blazed forth and through that fire I died to life and so was born todeath. And then again I died to form (Aries).The heat of earth, the fiery temper of the mother, destroyed the form, releasedthe soul and so the lesser self was killed (Scorpio).The waters drowned the man. The fish was made to disappear. It then appearedagain only to die or else to die and bring salvation” (Pisces).Thus there are symbolically the death through fire, the death through earth andthe death through water—burning, suffocation and drowning—but, in this worldcycle, the death through air is not either known or understood. There are nottherefore four deaths, as the goal of our system during manifestation is“initiation or release into the air,” so that the bird of life out of time andspace can fly free. The concept which the Law of Correspondence brings of thefinal death is covered by the words liberation, relinquishment and finalinitiation, and means little to humanity, for it concerns the planetary Logosand His life cycle. The three deaths which do overtake man, the individual andthe human family as a whole, release the soul into three great planetarycentres:1. The death by drowning or by water in Pisces releases man again into thatgreat centre which we call Humanity, [98] and there experience is gained. Hereinlies the mystery of the fish-goddesses of this sign “who spawn their young againand yet again.”2. The death by suffocation in Scorpio releases man into the planetary centrewhich we call the Hierarchy.3. The death by fire or burning in Aries releases man into another centre towhich we give the name Shamballa.There is much to work out, is there not, in these ideas which I offer to you assuggestive considerations and as hints related to the Science of Triangles,which is the esoteric basis of astrology, just as the doctrine of the trinity(microcosmic and macrocosmic) is the esoteric basis of occultism. Death is,therefore, of three kinds. This Science of Divine Dying underlies the well-knownphrase “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,” and when therelationship between Aries, Scorpio and Pisces is properly understood (as thelinking and merging of the three crosses) a new light will be thrown upon allsubsidiary sciences—exoteric and esoteric. The teaching in The Secret Doctrineabout the reincarnating monads who are called the divine Sacrifices, Lords ofKnowledge, Will and Sacrifice, will be clarified. These monads, who areourselves, are Lords of Persevering Ceaseless Devotion —devotion even untodeath.It is interesting here to note also that through the ruling planet, Mars, theaverage man born in this sign is related to Scorpio, and thus the Cardinal Crossis related to the Fixed Cross. Points of crisis can thus be noted when thehoroscope is considered from this angle. At the same time, Aries is related tobirth, through Mercury who rules Aries esoterically, and also Virgo, of whichMercury is the exoteric ruler. Through Uranus also, Aries is related toAquarius, [99] the sign of world service, leading to death and liberation inPisces. Uranus is the planet through which zodiacal energy flows, in connectionwith the Creative Hierarchies upon our planet, from one of the stars of theGreat Bear. It is these relationships with which esoteric astrology deals, andfrom them the universal can be grasped and the particular understood. The humanbeing in his eventual recognised group relationships is of more importance thanappears in his individual life, which the orthodox horoscope seeks to elucidate.It only determines his little destiny and unimportant fate. Esoteric astrologyindicates his group usefulness and the scope of his potential consciousness.I would remind you here that frequently when the ruler of a sign is given as theSun or the Moon I shall speak of one of the hidden planets, Uranus or Vulcan.These are interchangeable in their use and it is difficult to tell to which theesoteric planet refers unless you have been told. Hence my above reference toUranus.In connection with Aries, which expresses or is the agent primarily of the firstRay of Will or Power, the ray of the destroyer, it should be stated that firstray energy comes from the divine Prototype in the Great Bear, that it becomestransmuted into the force and activity of the planetary Logos of the first ray,and works out as His triple activity under the guidance of the three rulingplanets—Mars, Mercury and Uranus.Mars embodies sixth ray force which leads to idealism, destructive fanaticismfrequently, struggle, strife, war, effort and evolution. God's idea in Ariesbecomes the concrete plan in Capricorn whether that objective is the full flowerof the planetary life in all its forms, the ambition of a personality workingout its own ideas and ambitious worldly projects or the spiritual aspiration(worldly ambition [100] transmuted into its higher aspect) of the initiate, whoseeks to work out God's plans and make them his own. In every case, Mars leadsto the battle ground of Scorpio.Mercury , embodying the energy of the fourth ray, eventually carries the manaround the wheel of life and through the medium of conflict enables him toachieve harmony. Mercury illumines the mind and mediates between the soul andthe personality, being the Messenger of the Gods. This mediatorship, in thefirst instance, produces an inevitable opposition between the pairs of oppositesand a long drawn out conflict. This conflict finally works out into victory andthe dispelling of illusion through the illumination of the lower mind. Mercuryand the Sun are one , we are frequently told in the occult literature. The Sunis the symbol of the Son of God, Who is the mediator between Father-Spirit andMother-Matter. Mercury, therefore, leads Aries to Virgo (again speakingsymbolically) where the idea or Word of God begins to take form, andconsequently the latent life in Aries comes to the “crisis of the birth hour,”prior to the birth of the Christ, cosmically considered, though the birth of theindividual Christ takes place in Capricorn, at the close of the needed gestationperiod.Uranus embodies the energy of the seventh ray and its work is analogous to thatof Mercury, for the seventh ray is the ray which relates spirit and matter andbrings together electric fire and fire by friction, thus producingmanifestation. Uranus leads the soul to the burning ground during the finalstages of the Path, when the fire of Aries and the fires engendered through thepotency of Uranus produce the flaming heat of the final burning ground. Throughthis burning ground, the initiate has finally to pass. Uranus rules the occultWay and is, in an esoteric sense, connected with the Hierophant of the Mysteriesof Initiation.[101] Therefore, we have in relation to Aries and the life of the soul, whichthere comes into subjective manifestation, certain related signs wherein thesoul, in objective manifestation, passes through peculiar and definite crises:1. The crises of the battle field, leading to the culminating battle in Scorpioand the liberation into life in Capricorn, the place of the higher initiations,after the reversal of the wheel.2. The crisis of the birth place in Virgo, brought about through the activity ofMercury, leading through Leo to the birth of the Christ in Capricorn. Theself-conscious individual in Leo becomes the Christ-conscious Initiate inCapricorn.3. The crisis of the burning ground, which is brought about through the activityof Uranus. This is entered through the free choice of the initiate who makes hischoice in Libra, the point of balance where—usually—the moment for the reversalof the wheel takes place. There the man has to decide whether to proceed asusual and according to custom or, reversing the wheel, to pass through theburning ground to liberation. Libra is the polar opposite to Aries and thereforeclosely related.You will note that the rays which are related to or expressing themselvesthrough Aries are curiously balanced, Rays 1 and 7 are the highest and thelowest, and therefore demand a point of balance upon the wheel which is providedin Libra. Rays 6 and 4 bring to this balancing process the energy of the secondray, the major building ray which enables the man to build anew and providehimself with a spiritual body of manifestation.I would also call your attention to the fact that through Uranus, Aries isrelated to Aquarius. The vague beginnings [102] in Aries, the faint emergence ofthe latent embodied ideas have—after the turning of the wheel in twodirections—brought release in Capricorn and produced the world server inAquarius, who voluntarily stays upon the great wheel (using the Cardinal Crossas his conditioning signs) and thus staying within the sphere of influence inorder to help humanity to find liberation from the Fixed Cross.In the sweep of the zodiac there are four signs which are signs of birth, ofbeginning and of renewed cyclic realisation.1. Aries , the “birthplace of divine Ideas,” whether these ideas are soulsbrought into incarnation and controlled by Mars until they reach the point ofreorientation and become sensitive to the influence of Mercury, or whether theyare the birth of the ideas of God in the form of the hierarchical plans to whichthe initiate becomes sensitive.2. Cancer , the “birthplace into the life of form,” the door into physicalincarnation. This is the sign in which humanity, as a whole integrated unit, isborn, the scene of the emergence of the fourth kingdom in nature. Humanity has“emerged from rock and water and brings its habitation with it” (as the OldCommentary expresses it) and mass instinctual consciousness comes into being.Note that phrase.3. Leo , the “birthplace of the individual,” the coming into form of individualself-conscious man who emerges out of the mass and herd in Cancer, substituting,for instinctual consciousness, self-awareness and a sense of responsibility ofan individual kind.4. Capricorn , the “birthplace of the Christ,” the place of the “second birth”and the scene for the emergence of [103] the fifth kingdom in nature when theright time comes. In this sign, the initiate comes into a spiritual awarenesswhich demonstrates later in Aquarius and in Pisces as man, the world worker, andman, the world saviour—both of them with a universal mission.It is from hints such as these that the astrologer of the future will determinethe type of horoscope which should be cast. Two questions will then arise,requiring reasoned answers:1. Is the subject a personality , progressing around and around the wheel,perfecting self-consciousness and developing a rounded out personality throughexperience and the working of the Law of Karma, subject to the Great Illusionand arriving eventually at the height of personality ambition in Capricorn?2. Or, is this person beginning to manifest as a soul , pouring light throughdense fogs of illusion, and preparing for the major tests in Scorpio, to befollowed by initiation in Capricorn?Subsidiary questions would, for instance be: For which death is the manpreparing? Is there an imminent crisis at hand which indicates a birth into somenew state of consciousness? The crucial question, however, to be determined inevery case, is the direction in which the man is progressing around the wheel oflife. The orthodox horoscope concerns the personality life and the form is boundupon the “wheel of life as it turns from right to left” (from Aries to Taurusvia Pisces). But the soul is bound to the wheel as it turns from left to right,going from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus. It is this antagonistic movement of thewheel “turning upon itself” (as it is expressed in the Bible) [104] which leadsto the conflict carried on in the individual life, in the life of humanity andin the life of the planet. In the early stages of evolution and upon the MutableCross, the consciousness is entirely identified with life in form and with thelife of self-consciousness, self-preservation and self-enrichment. Then comes aninterlude wherein the consciousness begins to shift into that of the group andbecomes identified with the soul and with soul purpose. The experience of theFixed Cross covers this period. It might here be noted that the experience ofthe three crosses has a Masonic significance and can be connected with the BlueLodge:1. The Common Cross . . . The E .·. A .·. Degree2. The Fixed Cross . . . . . . The F .·. C .·. Degree3. The Cardinal Cross . . . . The M .·. M .·. DegreeMuch will come to light in Masonry when its astrological implications arestudied and understood. Much also will be revealed anent individual life andpurpose when the fate of certain planets (when in the various zodiacal signs) isproperly investigated and grasped and their symbolic significances interpreted.For instance, it is well known theoretically and mathematically that,1. The Sun is exalted in Aries. Here the Sun stands for the life of the spiritwhich comes to full expression as the result of the great evolutionary process,initiated in Aries. The life of God which in this sign is “swung into activity”eventually achieves consummation. Latency becomes potency and midnight mergesinto midday. God, the Father, rules.2. The power of Venus is lessened in this sign. It is a detrimental sign toVenus. The reason for this is that when the Sun is exalted and blazes forth inall its glory, [105] the other lesser luminaries fade out. Just as thepersonality is lost sight of in the light of the soul, the solar Angel, so thesoul itself disappears and its power and radiance fade out when the Presence,which it has hitherto veiled, appears and dominates the scene at the end of thegreater world cycle. We are told that the incarnating Minds, human beings, thesolar Angels, came originally from Venus, but they in turn give place to themonad, the One. Mind gives place to intuition and reason to pure perception.3. Saturn “falls” in Aries. This has two meanings, for this is a dual sign.First: Saturn is the Lord of Karma, the imposer of retribution and the one whodemands full payment of all debts and who therefore condemns us to the strugglefor existence, both from the form side and from the soul side. Saturn,therefore, “fell” when man fell into generation. He “followed the sons of mendown into their low place.” Second: Saturn's power is completely ended and hiswork accomplished when man (the spiritual man) has freed himself from Karma andfrom the power of the two Crosses—the Common and the Fixed. Esoterically, Saturncannot follow man on to the Cardinal Cross.There is much that could be elaborated along this line but the above will give ahint as to the esoteric significance of these three happenings within everysign. They can also indicate much concerning the man whose horoscope is underconsideration.The decanates can also be dealt with in two ways, according to the direction inwhich man is travelling upon the wheel and therefore entering the sign, speakingin symbols. [106] If he enters Aries when on the Common Cross he will come underthe influence of Mars, the Sun and Jupiter, according to Sepharial. This meansconflict, revelation and the successful satisfaction of desire and ambition asthe aeons pass away. When he reorients himself and mounts the Fixed Cross, hecomes under the influence of Jupiter, the Sun and Mars, for the initiate and thedisciple culminates his career in any of the signs with a final and dominantstruggle and fight. I would remark here that Alan Leo had a glimpse of the innersignificance of the decanates when he assigned Mars, the Sun and Venus to thethree decanates. He touched the truth of the inner subjective reversal upon thewheel which brings in other energies and influences when he substituted Venusfor Jupiter. Mind and heart must be coordinated and brought into play when thegreat reversal takes place.We have seen that Aries is the sign of beginnings—the beginning of the creativeprocess, the first step of the soul (the microcosm of the already initiatedMacrocosm) towards incarnation, the beginning of recurring and constant cyclesof experience, the beginning of the period wherein the soul changes itsdirection, its purpose and its method, and finally enters upon that definitelydefined process which we call spiritual regeneration and initiation. There arefour words of vital importance upon which we shall ring the changes, as we studythe path of evolution, or the progress of the soul around the great wheel, bothas a personality and as a disciple, headed towards the final liberating process.These four words express the subjective impulses and motives and, in reality,introduce four different cycles of progress upon the Path in its various stagesof individualisation to initiation. They are: [107]1. Re-creation in which the influence of Cancer, combined with that of Aries,produces the pull into incarnation upon the physical plane.2. Regeneration in which the growing influence of the Fixed Cross, playing uponthe Mutable Cross, produces those interior changes which eventually lead to3. Reorientation or the great cycle of repolarisation which takes place throughthe influence of Libra (the Cardinal Cross) and the “swerving of the Bull inmid-career,” as it is called in the ancient books. This process of reorientationleads to a passage around the wheel in which, steadily and persistently, theinner subjective man comes into outer manifested expression and the personalityrecedes into the background. Finally, there come twelve lives wherein the finalstage of4. Renunciation is experienced and the disciple or initiate renounces all forthe love of humanity and its service, and lays himself upon the altar ofsacrifice. He achieves, as a result, the final liberation.This liberation is, in reality, twelve-fold in nature, for liberation, victoryand triumph have to be experienced in every sign, just as captivity, defeat andfailure have been experienced in all the signs of the zodiac, whilst the man isfunctioning as a personality. It is these four words and their significancewhich will underlie all that I have to say to you anent the dual experience uponthe great wheel of life. I would ask you to bear this definitely in mind.Going through the great cycle from Aries to Taurus, the man reenters the signAries again under the potent impression of Taurus, which at this stage ofdevelopment feeds his ardent desire for the many material advantages of physicalincarnation and of constant worldly undertakings; thus [108] after a period ofre-creation, he passes out into incarnation in Pisces and begins again the greatround of manifested life, for Pisces is the ocean wherein he is “the fish,”controlled by the laws of substance or material existence. In the second greatstage, he passes from Aries to Taurus, because desire has at last beentransmuted into aspiration. After proving his steadfastness to the ideal of thespiritual life in the intervening signs, he passes again into Pisces, from theopposite direction to his usual procedure, having earned the right to mount theCardinal Cross of the Heavens, the power to take a final planetary initiationand the privilege of passing on to one of the seven paths to which I have madereference in my other books; these eventually give him “the freedom of the sevensolar systems,” as it is called in contradistinction to “the freedom of theseven planetary spheres,” which the experience of initiation has guaranteed him,after a process of intensive training in one or other of the planetary schools(according to his ray type) and the path of service chosen.You will see, therefore, the significance of the two keywords of the sign Aries:1. “And the Word said: Let form again be sought”The Man2. “I come forth and from the plane of mind, I rule”The InitiateExperience leads to rulership and in this sign the man who is embodied first rayforce develops the power of organisation, of control over forces, particularlyover the energy of death, over the power of destruction applied with love, ofdominance over multitudes, of cooperation with the plan and the practice of theWill in rightly and correctly guiding and directing planetary affairs.[109] Before we take up the remaining eleven signs of the zodiac, and in orderto give you a clear framework upon which to build the new astrology by means ofwhich you can grasp the dual procedure of the soul around the great wheel, Iwould point out that what I have given you on Aries will be dealt with also aswe consider the other signs. You will find that I have indicated significancesand pointed out some of the truths which can be found in connection with:1. The keynote of the signs . These express the underlying effect upon the manas he progresses in one of two directions.2. The Nature of the Cross upon which the man is crucified at any one time.3. The influence of the planetary Rulers —orthodox or esoteric.4. The Rays which primarily express themselves through a particular sign; theclue to which sign it may be is found in the orthodox planetary ruler where thepersonality ray is concerned and the esoteric planetary ruler where the soul isconcerned.5. The Qualities of the sign and of the man who has come forth in a particularsign.6. The interplay between a sign and its polar opposite.7. The planets which are exalted , in detriment , or which fall in anyparticular sign, for a study of these will indicate the three phases of thePath—with its involutionary cycle of becoming increasingly involved in matter,or life upon the Mutable Cross , the interlude of readjustment or struggle forliberation which leads to the mounting of the Fixed Cross , and the period ofliberation with the final mounting of the Cardinal Cross . [110]8. The significance of the key words for the modes of progress through thesigns.9. The underlying theme of any specific zodiacal sign, covered by the ideas ofre-creation, regeneration, reorientation and renunciation.Before taking up these matters in connection with Pisces, there are one or twopoints upon which I would like to touch. I have to take up certain problems asthey may arise in the consciousness of the enquirers and the students, becauseit is impossible to handle them all at once in the introductory remarks. Theconfusion would then be well nigh insuperable in the mind of the enquirer.Little by little, we will deal with the various debatable points, and if youwill have patience and hold back partisan conclusions, the picture of the newastrology will begin to emerge more clearly in your minds. At present, thereadjustment of your ideas leads to inevitable temporary bewilderment.One of the questions which normally arises might be expressed as follows, andwas so expressed by an interested astrological student. It involved thefollowing inquiry: Granted the inevitability of a man eventually reversing themode of his passage through the twelve signs, at what time and in which signdoes the Sun reverse? At what point in the swing of the zodiac can this reversalin the Sun itself be seen taking place?Unless you have some grasp of the nature of the great illusion of theconstitution of the Sun, it will be hard for you to understand the significanceof my reply. The sun to which you are referring is the physical Sun and itsapparent path in the heavens. This “appearance” will not outwardly changeand—here is the statement of importance—the real Sun under which our planetarylife will eventually function [111] and to which response will be made is theHeart of the Sun. When that is controlling, the spiritual man will then live adual life simultaneously (which is ever the problem of the man who is illuminedby the soul as well as by the light of day) and this dual life will consist ofour apparent experience and situations and our inner spiritual soul awareness.The personality will still respond to influences coming to it from the physicalSun but the motivated life activity and the subjective experience of the innerman will be conditioned by energies coming to him from the “Heart of the Sun.” Iwould here recall to your minds the teaching of the Ageless Wisdom as given inThe Secret Doctrine and elaborated by me in my later books, that the Sun has tobe discovered and known in its triple nature which is threefold as is theTrinity. The tabulation below may serve to make this idea somewhat clearer:1. Physical Sun . . . . . . . Form . . . . Personality. . Influencing MutableCross. 2. Heart of the Sun . . . . Soul Consciousness. . . . Influencing FixedCross. 3. Central spiritual Sun . Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Influencing Cardinal Cross.By the word “influencing” I here refer to the energies pouring from these threeaspects of the Sun through the three Crosses to our planet. Ponder on this andremember also that our Sun is travelling through space (carrying our solarsystem along in its sphere of influence) around our own central and conditioningstar which it has been rightly presumed exists in the constellation Taurus, theBull, being found in the Pleiades. At the same time it appears, from thestandpoint of our planet, to be passing through the twelve signs of the zodiac;this is a symbol macrocosmically considered, of the dramatic centralised pointof view of the individual human being, the microcosm. It is interesting to [112]compare the symbolism and the underlying truth connected with the lesser and thegreater zodiacs and with their twelve month and their 25,000 year cycles. Theybear out much that I have given you anent the soul, influenced by the esotericplanets eventually, and the personality, influenced by the orthodox planets. Thegreater zodiac is symbolic of the soul and the lesser of the personality. In thepersonality cycle, the lesser zodiac conditions the personality career and thetwelve planetary houses are of dominant importance. Later the influence of thetwelve signs supersedes the influence of the planets.I would like also to emphasise—perhaps unnecessarily—that Sirius, the Great Bearand the Pleiades work through the medium of the twelve constellations, pouringtheir influences through nine of them in particular, but that these majorconstellations are not part of the zodiac with which we are concerned. They,with the seven solar systems of which ours is one, are the ten constellationsconnected with a still greater zodiac which is not conditioned by the numericalsignificance of the number twelve. Hence ten is regarded as the number ofperfection. There is confusion in the minds of some of the less learned students(astrologically considered) on this point.It is rather difficult for you also to grasp that the involutionary process forall the kingdoms of nature is related to the passage of the soul (this time theanima mundi or world soul) from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus and not vice versa.The anima mundi on the involutionary arc proceeds this way and not as thepersonality proceeds. The anima mundi passes to Pisces at the close of everygreat cycle and not to Taurus. It emerges into outer manifestation in Cancer,the sign of mass or group life, of mass or [113] group activity; its diffusedconsciousness has not yet been individualised as has the consciousness of man.When the world soul after having progressed around the Great Wheel, reachedCancer and the time came for the fourth Creative Hierarchy to manifest throughthe fourth kingdom in nature, a reversal took place and then proceeded as now.It should be remembered with emphatic care that it is only man, individualisedman whose progress we are studying, plus his reactions to zodiacal and planetaryinfluences; we are dealing with his reactions, mental and emotional, to thegreat illusion and to spiritual reality as these two work in his life, objectiveand subjective. We have, in the larger issue, to consider the influence of thezodiac and the planets upon:1. The spirit of the Earth , the embodiment of the physical planet and the sumtotal of the form life in all the kingdoms of nature. These are the expressionof the anima mundi or of the world soul.2. Humanity , the individualised and finally initiated man. This is theembodiment of the human soul or ego, a differentiation of the world soul, whichexpresses itself as a personality (a correspondence to the spirit of the planet)and finally as a spiritual soul (a correspondence to the planetary Logos).3. The Lord of the Planet , one of the great Lives or Sons of God, at presentregarded as “an imperfect God” as far as our planet is concerned and yet, fromthe angle of humanity, perfect indeed.The above triple division expresses the three major aspects of the ancient andesoteric science of astrology and its three divisions as the Hierarchy todaystudies them. Humanity, [114] having lost the consciousness which permitscontact with the spirit of the planet (sub-human consciousness, and which wasthe basis of animism) and having not yet developed the consciousness whichpermits him to enter into the Life and Mind of the planetary Logos, has dealtonly with the second division and that in its lowest aspect.Two other points might here be touched upon, and for their understanding youwill have to accept my statements as temporary hypotheses at least, for you arein no position to know them as truth for yourselves. Exoteric astrology has saidand it is widely accepted that Vulcan, Uranus, Pluto and Neptune do not governsigns but only have affinity with them. I am touching upon this here because weare going to consider the planet Pluto in relation to Pisces. This affinity hasonly stated a partial truth and is only temporarily true from the standpoint ofthe modern astrologer. Their existence has only been inferred or discoveredwithin the last two or three centuries though it has always been known to theHierarchy. I have indicated to you the signs of which they are the rulers andthe astrology of the future will accept my statement and work with theseplanets. Much earlier in human history, they had to accept the fact of Mars andMercury as rulers of zodiacal signs in a hypothetical manner, and then start toprove the accuracy of the hypothesis. Ancient astrology was obviously incompletebut until man became patently responsive to the influences which come to himfrom Uranus or Pluto, for instance, which affect the soul life far more thanthey do the personality life, they remained undiscovered except by trainedesotericists. Today, humanity is rapidly responding to the higher spiritualinfluences and, therefore, we can look for the discovery of increasingly subtleforces.PISCES, THE FISHES[115] This sign is also dual. In Aries we have the duality which is attached tothe bringing together of spirit and matter in the great creative activity ofmanifestation at the beginning of the evolutionary cycle, whilst in Pisces wehave the fusion or blending of soul and form as far as man is concerned,producing the manifestation of the Incarnated Christ, the perfected individualsoul, the completed manifestation of the microcosm. Thus the greater and thelesser polar opposites—the human being and God, the microcosm and theMacrocosm—are brought to their destined expression and manifestation. Until manis nearing the goal, these words mean but little though a study of the signPisces in the two ways intended may reveal much that is significant andsuggestive. The goal of Deity, the emergence of God's plan and the nature of Hiseternal purpose is for us only a subject of interested speculation. There is apossibility that this plan and purpose may be vastly different to our surmisewhich is based upon our formulation of a Deity who is the product of our mentalprocesses and of devoted idealism (two of the three aspects of the personalitynature), and the attempt to interpret His infinite purposes in terms of our ownfiniteness. Let us always remember this. The mechanism for divine perception hasnot yet been developed in the human family on any large scale and is onlyachieving some measure of usefulness in the initiate of the third degree.This duality of Pisces must be studied in relation to its three keynotes whichare1. Bondage or captivity.2. Renunciation or detachment.3. Sacrifice and death.[116] In the first cycle of experience upon the wheel, the soul itself is incaptivity to substance; it has come down into the prison house of matter andlinked itself to form. Hence the symbol of Pisces, of the two fishes linkedtogether by a band. One fish stands for the soul and the other for thepersonality or form nature, and between them is to be found the “thread orsutratma,” the silver cord which keeps them bound to each other throughout thecycle of manifested life. Later on, upon the reversed wheel, the personality isbrought into captivity by the soul, but for long aeons the situation is reversedand the soul is the prisoner of the personality. This dual bondage is brought toan end by what is called the final death, when the complete release of the lifeaspect from the life of form takes place. It should be borne in mind also thatthe soul itself is of the nature of form from the standpoint of the Monad,though it is a form far subtler than any that we know in the three worlds ofhuman evolution. There is also a dual renunciation referred to in these keywords, for first of all the soul renounces the life and light of the Monad, itssource (symbolized by the words “the Father's home”), and descends into theocean of matter; then, reversing itself, the soul renounces the life of form,the personality centre. The soul detaches itself (in consciousness) from theMonad, the One, and functions from its own centre, making its own new andmaterial attachments. Then, upon the reversal of the wheel, it proceeds todetach itself from the personality and re-attach itself in consciousness to theOne Who sent it forth. Such is the climaxing story of Pisces. The Lords of Willand Sacrifice come down into manifestation, sacrificing their high position andopportunities upon the higher planes of manifestation in order to redeem matterand raise the lives by which it is informed (the lower Creative Hierarchies) tothe [117] status of Themselves in so far as They constitute the fourth CreativeHierarchy. This is the subjective purpose, underlying the sacrifice of thesedivine Lives Who are ourselves essentially, Who are qualified by knowledge, loveand will, and animated by ceaseless persevering devotion. They seek to bringabout the death of the form in its occult significance and the consequentrelease of the indwelling lives into a higher state of consciousness. Of thisprocess, all the world Saviours—past, present and to come—are the manifestedsymbols and the eternal guarantees. It is in such recognitions as these that themainspring to the life of service must be sought. People born in this sign arefrequently to be found serving the race and ministering to its needs upon somelevel of consciousness. Thus they are prepared for the final sacrifice in Pisceswhich “absorbs them back into their originating Motive,” as the Old Commentaryexpresses it. It is for this reason that the life of service and the directedintention to serve constitute a scientific mode of achieving release. InAquarius, the sign of world service, the lesson is finally learned whichproduces the world Saviour in Pisces. Hence my constant emphasis upon service.When the individual man enters upon his cycle of incarnations, and emerges inthe sign Cancer, which is found in the Cardinal Cross, he metaphorically mountsthe Mutable Cross and his long term of imprisonment in form begins and thelessons of servitude must be learned. He goes on learning until he hastransformed servitude into service. He alternates between the pairs ofopposites, both from the astral, emotional angle and from the point of view ofthe four arms of the Mutable Cross. The fluid, sensitive temperament inPisces—mediumistic and psychically polarised—must be stabilised in Virgo, inwhich sign mental [118] introspection and critical analysis become possible andserve to arrest the fluidity of Pisces. These two signs balance each other. Wemight study the dual process taking place upon the wheel through the medium ofthe Mutable Cross of which Pisces forms a part in the following manner:1. Pisces—Here the beginner upon the way of life starts with a materialreceptivity which will enable him to respond to all contacts in the cycle ofmanifestation. He is, at this stage, negative, fluid and endowed with aninstinctual consciousness which contains within itself the potentiality of theintuition. But the seed of the intuition is dormant. The mind which is theinstrument of reception from the intuition is, at this stage, unawakened.2. Sagittarius—Here the ordinary man begins to demonstrate a tendency to becomemore focussed and the fluidity and negativity of Pisces become concentrated uponthe attainment of that which is desired. The man demonstrates one-pointedselfish instincts and though he may be, for instance, friendly and kind, it isthrough a desire for popularity. This is a good expression of the individualSagittarian subject and shows also the tendency of the soul to turn all evileventually into good. The lessons of life are being learned and experiment isgoing on.3. Virgo—In Virgo, the man who was fluid in Pisces and emotionally selfish andfull of desire in Sagittarius, begins to focus still more intently and to reasonand think. The latent soul is becoming interiorly active; a germination processis proceeding; the hidden man is making his presence felt. The intellect isawakening [119] and instinct—after passing through the emotional stage—is beingtransmuted into intellect.4. Gemini—In the undeveloped man or the average man, the experiences undergoneon three arms of the Mutable Cross have brought him to the stage where the“dream of life” can be changed into the recognition of the reality, and theGreat Illusion can be seen as undesirable and untrue. The sense of duality is,at this stage, instinctual but becoming increasingly real and steadily morecomplex. The man begins to dream of stability, of ordered changes and of unionwith that which he senses to be the most real part of himself. The mysticalvision emerges into his consciousness and he becomes aware of the higher selfthrough the first faint flickerings of the intuition.The experience upon the Mutable Cross lasts a long time, and carries the manalways back again and again into the sphere of influence of Aries which, throughthe ruling activity of the first ray, both strengthens the will of the man (nomatter what his ray) and ends cycle after cycle with the “word of destruction.”Again and again, he enters into the sign Pisces and finds his way around thegreat wheel until the experience of change and of mutability and theestablishing of the transmutation process carry his consciousness from theinstinctual and intellectual stages to the faint beginnings of the intuitiveprocesses in Gemini. Then comes a great process of polarisation and a moment oftransference, after which the influence of the Fixed Cross causes reversal andthe lessons gained upon the Mutable Cross have to be worked out and the effectsdemonstrated upon the Fixed Cross. It must not be thought that, in the early[120] stages of unfoldment, experience is gained only through the Mutable Cross.The man lives in and experiences in all the signs, but the influences pouringthrough the Mutable Cross have a more potent effect upon him than those pouringin the early stages through the Fixed Cross. It is only when the soul isbecoming more alive within the form and the man is aware of his duality that theenergies of the Fixed Cross supersede in effectiveness those of the MutableCross, just as after the third initiation the energies of the Cardinal Crossbegin to control the man and are of more insistent incentive than those of theother two crosses.When the soul is, therefore, becoming more active, the effect of the Fixed Crosswill be seen working out in the four signs along with the effects of forces ofthe Mutable Cross for “that which is dominated and relinquished is held firmlyand transformed.”Gemini—The man upon the reversing wheel in Gemini becomes increasingly aware ofthe intuition and increasingly under the influence of “the Brothers who live inthe Light,” as the Twins are sometimes called. The light of the personality dimsand the light of the soul waxes. The fluidity of Pisces and the undevelopedGemini gives place to the responsiveness of the personality to soul impressionand consequent stabilising of the life on the physical plane.Virgo—The mind, under the influence of Virgo, which has been analytical andcritical, changes to that quality of mind which is best described by the words,illumination and revelation . The Christ to whom the Virgin must eventually givebirth is recognised as present in the womb, though not yet born. Life isrecognised. The process of the revelation of the Christ consciousness is [121]carried intelligently forward and the selfish aspirations and experiments of theundeveloped man give place to the selflessness of the illumined and intuitivedisciple.Sagittarius—This is now the sign of the one-pointed disciple. The life of fluidresponse to matter becomes that of the focussed response to spirit andpreparation for initiation in Capricorn. The arrow of the mind is projectedunerringly towards the goal.Pisces—Here, at the final stage, Pisces stands for the death of the personalityand the release of the soul from captivity and its return into the task of theworld Saviour. The great achievement is finished and the final death isundergone. “There is no more sea” says the ancient book, which means inevitablythe “death of the fishes” and the release of the imprisoned life into new formsor new cycles of the divine Adventure.This Mutable Cross, of which Pisces is one of the arms, is predominantly theCross of “repeated incarnations,” of varied experiments under the various signsand orthodox rulers, and of those many experiences which lead to successive andcontinuous expansions of consciousness. It is therefore the cross of the Son ofGod, the incarnating Christ, though it is, in relation to this Cross, the Crossof the planetary Christ, just as the Fixed Cross is that of the individualChrist in each human being, and the Cardinal Cross is that of the cosmic Christ.It might here be noted that the Cross with which we are here concerned is thatof the mass, and that the consciousness which it exemplifies is that of theinstinctual consciousness and its merging into the intellectual consciousness;it is the Cross of the anima mundi and of the human soul before theconsciousness of duality is clear in the mind of the man and before transfer ismade on to the [122] Fixed Cross. It is consequently more closely allied to theCardinal Cross of the Heavens, for the mass consciousness, which is thesignificant consciousness of the Mutable Cross, becomes the group consciousnessor the synthetic consciousness of divinity, after passing through the interimperiod or the “vital interlude” of the intense self-consciousness of the manupon the Fixed Cross. This human interlude is in the nature of a cross sectionin the development of consciousness, but the main emphasis is the unfoldment ofthe mass consciousness of all the kingdoms in nature into the groupconsciousness of the three highest kingdoms through the mediatorship of thehuman kingdom which, through its peculiar and specific type of awareness, canrelate the higher and the lower expressions of divinity. It is here and in thisconnection that the sign Pisces is of much importance, as it is the sign ofmediatorship. Mediumship in its true meaning is expressive of the massconsciousness—impressibility, negativity and receptivity. These points willbecome clearer as we study the signs and their many inter-relations. The thoughtI wish to convey to you here is that at this stage the influence of Pisces onthe involutionary arc, and as the Sun retrogrades through the signs, is feltlargely in the anima mundi and in the hidden, incarnated and imprisoned Christ;the germ of the Christ life is psychically impressed, becoming constantly moresensitive to these psychical impressions, swept by desire which ever changes,constantly aware of all impinging contacts, but unable as yet to interpret themcorrectly, for the mind has not been awakened adequately in Virgo. This hiddenChrist is unable to free itself from “contact with the Water.” That point iseventually reached and is being reached with great rapidity in the present humanstage where another and major change is deemed desirable and this is the resultof the many lesser [123] changes. Change is ever needed but the method changesitself from the constant variability and mutability of the Mutable Cross tocertain changes of a major kind which are brought about by a more permanent anddirected life tendency.The man at this stage has within him the potencies and the characteristics ofthe indwelling Christ, but they are not manifesting and are only latentpossibilities for he is as yet entirely controlled by his form nature (theprison) and his environment. The hidden powers of the soul are negative and thepowers of the form nature are positive and beginning to find increasingly potentexpression. The natural spiritual tendencies of man are inhibited (for Pisces isoften a sign of inhibition and hindrances) and the natural animal andpersonality powers—particularly the emotional—are the obvious and visiblequalities of the man. A good deal of symbolism connected with the latent Christand the outer expressive personality can be seen if a study is made of theBiblical story of Jonah and the whale. I have not time to enlarge upon it here,but it is a parable concerned with the Piscean stage of consciousness and theawakening of the Christ consciousness with the consequent dispute which thatentails. Jonah stands for the hidden imprisoned Christ, alive to the perils ofthe situation, and the whale of large size stands for the bondage of incarnationand for the personality.It is in this dual sign that the imprisoned soul and the personality enter uponthat process which will transmute1. The lower nature into the higher manifestation.2. The lower psychical powers into the higher spiritual faculties, i.e.a. Negativity into positive soul control. [124]b. Mediumship into mediatorship.c. Clairvoyance into spiritual perception.d. Clairaudience into mental telepathy and finally inspiration.e. Instinct into intellect.f. Selfishness into divine selflessness.g. Acquisitiveness into renunciation.h. Self-preservation into selfless world service.i. Self-pity into compassion, sympathy and divine understanding.3. Spiritual and mental inhibition into soul expression and mental sensitivity.4. Devotion to the needs of the self into developed devotion and response to theneeds of humanity.5. Attachment to environment and to personality conditions (identification withform) into detachment from form and ability to identify with the soul.The ordinary low-grade medium is the outstanding example of the worst aspects ofPisces—negativity, impressionability, animal and emotional sensitivity withcomplete undevelopment of the mental principle. It would be of interest to findout two things scientifically:1. Whether the majority of the lowest kind of medium (trance mediums inparticular) have Pisces dominant in some powerful manner in their charts.2. Whether those mediums who are becoming more positive and more self-controlled and who are beginning to get a glimpse of the higher correspondencesin their work—mediatorship and interpretive activity—have not got Virgoappearing somewhere with real potency [125] and activity. This might indicatethe awakening of the mind, in the first instance, and eventually that there wasa shift in the influence controlling them, from the orthodox planetary rulershipto that of the more esoteric planets. It might be added that spiritualism andthe work of the spiritualistic movement are under the influence of Pisces withCancer rising, or in some stages with the reverse—Cancer with Pisces rising.As regards the rays which express themselves through the planetary rulers andwhich absorb or collaborate with the influences of the sign Pisces and thusinfluence our planet and humanity, we find a most interesting situation. Twomajor rays express themselves through the rulers of Pisces, orthodox andesoteric: The first Ray of Will or Power, focussed through Pluto, and the secondRay of Love-Wisdom. It is the interplay of these dual potencies which:1. Produces the duality of this sign.2. Brings about the major problem of Pisces—psychic sensitivity.3. Causes the lure of the Path, in the first instance the path of evolution andlater the lure of the probationary path with the consequence that transferenceto the Fixed Cross (which is all that we can intelligently comprehend) beginsreally in Pisces; though impulsed (if I may use such a word) in Aries it beginsand ends in Pisces.4. Precipitates the process of transmutation and eventual escape through death.5. Unfolds the significance, activity and beauty of death and of the work of thedestroyer.[126] From this it will be apparent how important and powerful is this sign.Through its orthodox ruler, Jupiter, that force is brought to bear which “bringsall together” and— in this case—relates the two fishes and binds them togetherin a functioning relationship. It is the activity consequently of the second rayforce which relates soul and form and brings the two together, and this magneticpotency is peculiarly descriptive of the activity of Pisces. From another angleand in a dual sign, this can also be seen working out in Gemini. In Pisces,there is demonstrated the captivity angle of relationship and the two fishes areunable to escape from each other; in Gemini there is also a definiterelationship between the two brothers but there is no connecting band, and inthat relationship is latent free choice and free determination. In connectionwith a lesser duality found in every human being, that of head and heart, ofmind and love, and of will and wisdom, the work of Jupiter is to develop thesetwo qualities and bring them into synthetic interplay. Eventually there has tobe the complete fusion of love and mind before a world saviour can manifest andfunction efficiently, and this is pre-eminently the final result of the forcesof the Mutable Cross, as they work out the qualities released by the planetsactive in Pisces, Sagittarius, Virgo and Gemini. These planets are:Orthodox—Jupiter and Mercury.Esoteric—Pluto. The Earth. The Moon (hiding Vulcan) and Venus.As you know, Pluto stands for death or the region of death; the Earth stands forthe sphere of experience; the Moon or Vulcan stands for the glorification,through purification and detachment, of matter, and Venus stands for theemergence of the love principle through the directing power of the [127] mind.Students will find it interesting to work out the implications for themselves.Orthodox astrology assigns only two planets to these four signs, which in itselfindicates a definite interplay. Jupiter and its influences indicate that the wayof incarnation is the “beneficent” method of evolutionary unfoldment and thatthe way of love-wisdom (2nd ray) is the way for humanity to go. Mercuryindicates that the line of least resistance for humanity is harmony throughconflict, for Mercury expresses the fourth ray energy which is buddhic,intuitional and expressive of the Christ, as Mercury and the Sun are one. Butthe esoteric planets are more explicit in their inferences and man appears, whenready for their influence, to be responsive in a fourfold way which he is not inthe earlier stages. They embody the recognitions and the reactions whichcondition man's consciousness when he is preparing to transfer off the MutableCross and mount the Fixed Cross. He comes, therefore,1. Through Venus—under the power of mind, transmuted into wisdom through theinstrumentality of love.2. Through the Moon—under the bondage of form in order through form experienceto achieve release and the “uplift of matter” in Vulcan.3. Through the Earth—under the influence of planetary experience (which isdifferent to individual experience) in order to transmute his personalconsciousness into group awareness.4. Through Pluto—under the destroying power of death—death of desire, death ofthe personality and of all which holds him between the pairs of opposites, inorder to achieve the final liberation. Pluto or death never destroys theconsciousness aspect.[128] Six planets, therefore, govern the Mutable Cross as far as humanity isconcerned and this in itself is significant, for six is the number of the greatwork of the period of manifestation, is the number of “the Beast,” which is thelower nature as far as man is concerned, and is all that which seeks to destroythe higher life, but also that which can be controlled and directed finally bythe soul. The significance of numbers enters into this science of esotericastrology, and numerology, as it is, per se , a branch of esoteric astrology.Love—Mind—Experience—Form—Human Understanding—Death: these are the keynotes ofthe fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human kingdom and they are embodied in theplanetary influences which pour through these planets from their allied signs.Through the activity of these forces which work at this stage through theMutable Cross, man is brought to a great Crisis of Polarisation and to a pointof basic change for which all the earlier and many changes have prepared him.It is these words also which, from a different angle, govern the processesundergone upon the Path of Discipleship and of Probation. The task of thedisciple is to understand their significance in a practical and effective mannerand to deal with the energies which these planets release, subordinating them tothe energies released by the Fixed Cross upon which he stands, and thus increasetheir potency through occult combination. It is by achieving intelligent andactive response to the energies released and earlier mastered through theexperience of the Mutable Cross, and by relating them to the potencies let looseupon him whilst crucified upon the Fixed Cross, that he learns to preparehimself for the twelve great tests in all the twelve signs for which theexperience of the two Crosses prepares him.Pisces governs the feet and hence the whole thought of [129] progress, ofattaining the goal, and the treading of the Path of Return has been theunderlying spiritual revelation of the great cycle through which we are passing;also, in the Piscean Age, the lesser cycle out of which we are at this timemoving, it has been the origin of all the teaching given by the world religionsanent the various stages of the Path of Return. Some astrologers hold also thatPisces governs the generative processes. They are essentially correct becauseonce a man is nearing or upon the Path he should become increasingly creative inthe higher sense and the physical generative processes should give placeesoterically to regeneration and to creation upon the mental plane instead ofonly upon the physical plane. This higher creative functioning becomes possibleunder the influence of aspiration and intuition. This begins to take place whenthe four esoteric rulers supplement the activity of the two orthodox rulers. Itis interesting to note that the astrologer, Alan Leo, suggests Neptune as analternative to Jupiter. He sensed and touched upon a mystery of initiationthough he did not realise the magnitude of his discovery. Neptune focusses theinfluence of Pisces as it concerns humanity as a whole and not just theindividual man, but this only takes place towards the final stages of the Pathof Discipleship. Today humanity is moving rapidly towards the position of theWorld Disciple, and intuiting this, he suggests Neptune as an alternative toJupiter.Esoterically, the reason that Venus is exalted in Pisces is connected with therelation of Pisces to the sign Gemini, of which Venus is the esoteric ruler, andalso in relation to the fact that Venus is the Earth's alter ego and is closelyrelated to the human kingdom. This subject is too vast and complicated to beelaborated here, but the point should be remembered. The Fishes in Pisces arebound together, as [130] we have seen, and this is a symbol of the captivity ofthe soul in form, prior to the experience upon the Fixed Cross. The Twins inGemini are symbols of the same basic duality, but the experience of the manychanging incarnations has done its work, and the Band (uniting the two fishes)is in process of dissolution, for part of the work of Pluto is to “cut thethread which binds the two opposing lives together.” It is the task of Venus to“reunite the severed lives but with no binding thread.” Therefore, Venus isexalted in Pisces and at the end of the greater cycle, the Sons of God who arethe Sons of Mind are raised up into glory through experience and crucifixionbecause they have learned to love and truly reason. The influence of Pisces,Gemini and Virgo is eventually fused and blended (symbolically the Cross mustalways become the line and then the point). Sagittarius, which is governedesoterically by Mother Earth, produces those conditions whereby the Path itselfachieves glorification. Consequently, you have at the end of the age (I referhere to a greater round of the zodiac and to no shorter cycle), theglorification of Venus, of Virgo, the Virgin, and of Mother Earth—two planetsand one constellation—and all these are potencies which produce definite changesin the solar system. They represent the three divine potencies of matter and ofsubstance, plus the force of Sagittarius driving them on to a still greaterconsummation. There is a wide and interesting field of research to be found inthe relation of1. The planet Venus—ruler of the constellation Gemini.2. The Earth on which we live, called often “Mother Earth.”3. The Fish-goddesses of the sign Pisces.4. Virgo, the Virgin. [131]Gemini and Sagittarius are connected through their ruling planets (because theEarth is more closely related to Venus than to any other planet) and thus againyou have the six potencies which produce release from the bondage of form,entered into in Cancer as far as the mass of humanity is concerned (by this Imean the birth of the human kingdom) and in Pisces as far as the individual isconsidered.In pointing out the significance of the above facts, I am not considering theorthodox astrological reasons for the exaltation and the fall of certain planetsin certain signs, I am concerned with the effect of the waxing and the waninginfluence upon the subject, man. Bear this in mind and—at the same time—rememberthat we are occupied with the Great Illusion which it is the major task of manin this particular world cycle to master and dissipate, and so to inaugurate thereign of the Real. It is the revelation of the Real which is the task allinitiates undertake after the final experience of the twelve final tests in thetwelve signs. Therefore, when we find that the power of Mercury is lessened inPisces and that it finally “falls” in that sign, what is the esoteric andspiritual meaning? Simply, that after the stage of initiation in Capricorn, asthe result of the reversal of the wheel and the consequent experiences , andafter the triumph of Scorpio, the power of the mind lessens steadily tillfinally (like other aspects of form life in the three worlds) it comes to an endand its meaning and illuminating aspects between soul and physical brain are nolonger required. The man, coming definitely into full soul consciousness,requires now no mediator but deals directly himself with his emanating source.Mercury is then met with again under another name, this time as the Sun,mediating between the higher aspects—soul and spirit—for [132] Mercury and theSun are One. Through Mercury, the mind is illumined and relation is establishedbetween personality and the soul. As Mercury, the Sun—the mediator—shifts to astill higher plane and is no longer mediator between two different stages inconsciousness but between life and consciousness itself; this is a verydifferent matter and effects the higher understanding. This will necessarily beincomprehensible to you at present for it is not a mediatorship betweendifferences but a fusion of what is already related. Are you any the wiser forthat statement?The same symbolic mode of interpretation must govern also our understanding ofthe three decanates. Both Leo and Sepharial give a list of the decanates andbetween them there is much resemblance but there is, however, an importantdifference. Leo approaches the closer to the esoteric interpretation ofastrology whilst Sepharial is purely exoteric. According to Sepharial, the threedecanates are governed by Saturn—Jupiter—Mars, presenting opportunity to workoff karma and to be successful in so doing and indicating the method employed,that of conflict and of war. Leo gives us Jupiter, the Moon and Mars. Heindicates, therefore, the success which is incident to proved discipleship andconsequent readiness for initiation, the seeing of the vision with which Jupiterrewards the disciple, and the experience which Vulcan confers. Vulcan has beenhitherto hidden, but its influence has steadily superseded all lunar control,for the personality or form side of life is lost to sight in the radiance of theSun, the soul. The light of Vulcan and the light of the Sun are one light andthese three—Mercury, Vulcan and the Sun—stand for a synthesis and a radiancewhich eventually dims the light of Mercury and it “falls” into the backgroundand Vulcan too becomes invisible and only the Sun remains. We have consequentlya [133] vision of the Sun, the experience of the personality and effort, whichis the mode of attainment governed by Mars.The keywords of this sign are obvious in their implications. Where thepersonality is concerned and the wheel rotates in the normal manner for theordinary average or undeveloped person, the Word is “And the Word said, Go forthinto matter.” The command of the soul to its instrument during the earlierstages of evolution goes forth and the response comes immediately from the onewho “blinds the soul to truth, holding it in durance vile.” These words you areamply able to interpret for yourselves and from your own standpoint which is theonly standpoint of service to you, indicating to you what lies behind upon thepath of evolution, the point upon the Path where you now stand and the immediatestep, vision, experience and effort which lie ahead.In closing what I have to say about the constellation Pisces, I would, at thispoint, make one practical suggestion which will save students much trouble inthe long run. Gather together, as you read, the statements I make anent anyparticular sign, planet or major constellation. You will then have right underyour eye the information needed on any specific point and can study successfullythis complicated transitional astrology. And yet, is it any more complicated tothe beginner than a textbook on physics or chemistry? I think not. What doescomplicate the problem is your feeling of doubt and questioning as to the truthand the verifiability of the statements made. Yet the beginner in chemistry hasto accept the statements of the expert who has written his textbook, and does soaccept them until the time comes when he can verify them himself throughexperiment. You might in this connection retort by saying that the conclusionspresented to him have been tested again and [134] again for centuries in manycases and for decades in others, and that there is little real room forquestioning. This is equally true of the science of astrology, for itsfoundations have been tested for millenia of years and have proven correct andits experts are wiser and more synthetic and selfless in their application ofthe science than are any other group of scientists. I refer here to the trueesoteric astrologers who stand behind the astrological movement in the worldtoday. I would ask you to remember this and to regard yourselves as beginners,leaving conclusions on one side until you have grasped more of the essentialsand the theory. For this exoteric astrology may have prepared you, in somecases.AQUARIUS, THE WATER CARRIERThis constellation is one of supreme importance to our solar system at thistime, for it is the sign into which our Sun is rapidly moving and its influenceis gaining in momentum and added potency with each vanishing decade. It is,therefore, largely responsible for the changes now being effected in ourplanetary life in all the kingdoms of nature, and, because it is an air sign,its influence is all pervasive and inter-penetrating. To many types of mind,this influence is intangible and must, therefore, be unable to produce thedesired results; yet the fact is that these intangible pervasive results are offar greater potency and are far more extensive in their effects than the moreconcrete and spectacular happenings. It is not my intention here to deal withthese subjective and potent effects. I have indicated much and have hinted atmore in my other writings. I am only generalising in this delineation of thesubjective significance of the twelve signs, and seeking to give a broad and notdetailed picture [135] of what I might call the lines of the new astrology, itsmode of approach to the more esoteric aspects involved in the soul horoscope.The new astrology will deal with significances and meanings, and not so muchwith the symbols and the outer happenings such as events and mundane activities.The keynotes of this sign are three in number and very easy to understand,though when they make their note felt on the reversing wheel, most difficult todemonstrate. They are:1. The service of the personality, the lower self, which eventually transmutesitself into the service of humanity.2. Superficial and selfish activity which changes into a deep and activeintention to be active on behalf of the Hierarchy.3. Self-conscious living which changes finally into a sensitive humanitarianawareness.The quality of these keynotes changes from a petty and superficial nature to oneof deep purpose and profound conviction. The low grade and undeveloped Aquarianupon the Mutable Cross manifests through a superficial self-awareness. Thismatures in Leo and becomes a deep-seated self-consciousness and a profoundinterest in self and its need and wishes. As the interplay goes on between Leoand Aquarius (for they are polar opposites) there comes a deepening of allqualities and the superficialities disappear until—upon the reversed wheel—theintensive self-consciousness of Leo expands into the group awareness ofAquarius. The individual becomes the universal. Man, alone and separative,becomes mankind in his reactions and awareness and yet, at the same time,preserves his individuality; he is no longer just a human being, individuallyself-centred [136] and separative, but becomes humanity itself, losing hispersonal identity in the good of the whole yet retaining his spiritual Identity.From self-service, he proceeds to world service and yet is always theindividualised Son of God until after the third initiation.As one studies these twelve signs, it is interesting to trace the relation ofconsciousness to the preceding sign and to the succeeding sign. It is peculiarlyso in connection with the sign Aquarius. The material, earthly quality ofCapricorn becomes “dissolved into the air” in Aquarius. The individual “fish” ofthe other sign becomes eventually the soul, and soul quality emerges, and on thereversed wheel it demonstrates as the pervasiveness of wisdom (Pisces) and theuniversal love of the truly developed Aquarian. On the wheel as it “rolls onwardinto illusion,” the wheel of the personality, the superficiality and the airynature of the undeveloped Aquarian deepens gradually into the concrete and rockymaterial nature of the Capricornian. The average man in Aquarius puts all hiswares into the window, and often in the room behind the window there is littleto be found. Esoterically, the developed Aquarian puts all he has into his waterpot, storing it there for service and giving it freely on demand to meet a need.The sign Aquarius is also a dual sign and signifies two vibrations. It is herethat its relation to Pisces emerges, for just as Pisces on the wheel ofillusion, the Mutable Cross, stands for substance and bondage, in Aquarius,substance and the anima mundi or imprisoned soul begin to work in mutualtolerance, and in the higher Aquarian individual, soul and spirit are expressingthemselves through substance. There is consequently an astrological relationbetween the band of stars in the constellation Pisces, which unites the twofishes, and the quality and nature of Aquarius [137] which relates and bindstogether into one working and synthetic whole. The Aquarian recognises the bondwhich holds all together subjectively and in truth, whilst in Pisces the energyof relationship constitutes an imprisoning band which confines and holdscaptive. Think this out. It is an error to consider the margin of contactbetween two signs in the passage of the Sun to be in the nature of hard and fastfrontiers or set boundary lines. Such is not the case. There are no rigid linesof demarcation separating two entirely different areas of experience andconsciousness upon the solar path. It only appears to be so and this itself ispart of the Great Illusion.The rulers of Aquarius are of a peculiar interest. They constitute an effectivegroup of planets and bring in the influences of the seventh, second and fourthrays. These are pre-eminently the rays which determine the final stages of man'sprogress as well as the initial stages, being more potent at the beginning ofthe involutionary path and the end of the evolutionary path than they are in themiddle period. They determine the final stages and happenings of the Path ofInitiation. The seventh ray brings into expression upon the physical plane themajor pairs of opposites—spirit and matter—and relates them to each other,producing eventually one functioning whole. The second ray gives soul expressionand spiritual consciousness and also the power to pour out love and wisdom uponearth whilst the fourth ray indicates the field of service and the mode ofattaining the goal. This mode or method is that of conflict and struggle inorder to reach harmony and thus express all truly human characteristics, for thefourth ray and the fourth Creative Hierarchy constitute essentially oneexpression of truth.Some astrologers assign Saturn as one of the rulers. [138] Alan Leo does so, butI would point out that in this case he is dealing entirely with the progress ofthe ordinary man upon the wheel of life, and the Saturn which he senses asruling Aquarius is the Saturnian influence of Capricorn, in which sign Saturngoverns in two fields. On the reversed wheel, the Saturnian influence exhaustsitself in Capricorn and the man is then free from karma and needs nopresentation of opportunity for he stands a free initiate, a true Master Masonand can then proceed with world service undeterred and held back by no thoughtof self or selfish desire. He comes then under the influence of Uranus, thatmysterious and occult planet. His will is focussed and developed by the Uranianinfluences and he develops into a leader. He brings about desired changes andproduces those new conditions which will help the soul of humanity to expressitself more freely. Water being the symbol of substance and of materialexpression plus emotional motivation, Aquarius is consequently dual in itsactivity, and the third ray expresses itself powerfully through this sign,reaching our planet through Uranus and the Moon which hides or veils Uranussymbolically in this case. There is, therefore, to be found the double influenceof Uranus, expressing the quality and bringing in the energies of the seventhray, in one case, and the third ray in the other. The seventh ray is, in thelast analysis, the focussed differentiated energy of Ray One as it expresses thewill of the first aspect of divinity on earth through the power to relate andbring into objective manifestation—by an act of the will—both spirit and matter.This it brings about through the activity of Ray Three, expressing itselfthrough humanity and its individual units, though combining with the energy ofthe three rays which are released through the ruling planets: [139]1. Uranus—Ray Seven—The will to be and to know simultaneously on all planes ofmanifestation.2. Jupiter—Ray Two—The fusion of heart and mind, which is the subjective purposeof manifestation. This is brought about through the third and the seventh rayactivity on the exoteric wheel.3. The Moon—Ray Four—The will to be and to know plus the fusion of heart andmind is the result of the work carried forward in the fourth Creative Hierarchyunder the influence of that energy which produces harmony through conflict.I would here call your attention to the fact that in connection with the Moon,as it is related here to one of the Creative Hierarchies, you have in the Moonitself the exoteric influences of the ordinary mode of procedure upon the wheelof life, and in the planet which it veils and hides (in this case the planetUranus) you have the esoteric energy which brings this Hierarchy to subjectiverealisation.Uranus gives innate spontaneous activity and this produces evolutionarydevelopment—both natural and spiritual. It is the urge to better conditions.Jupiter gives an inherent tendency to fusion which nothing can arrest. Theachievement of ultimate synthesis is inevitable, and this Jupiter promotes.The Moon brings about the inclination to create these conditions which lead tothe great and critical transformations of instinct into intellect. This the moonbrings about, but Uranus causes the great transference in the humanconsciousness from intellectual perception to intuitive knowledge. Bear in mindthat the esoteric forces combine with the forces of the exoteric or orthodoxplanets and that they do not negate their influence. They only supplement [140]and dominate them. The man is thereby enriched and his experience is extendedand his consciousness expanded by the new energies, but all the time the effectsand conditioning achieved and attained under the old influences are not altered.They have “determined” his nature and fixed his qualities and, therefore, remainpersistent and energetic, but the new and deeper influences and potencies arethose which in the future upon the Fixed Cross will condition and motivategradually and steadily all his activities. In the future, instead of speaking ofthe orthodox planets when dealing with the planetary influences we will speak ofthe exoteric and the esoteric planets and so bring our vocabulary and definitivewords more into line with the inner teaching. In astrology, we are dealing allthe time with the energies which produce movement and subjective and outeractivity; we are concerned with the impact of many forces upon the human, theplanetary and the systemic expression of life and purpose, and with theresultant effects. When these effects and activities are purely objective (andunder that word I place all events and happenings going on in the three worldsof human experience—the physical, astral and mental planes) you have personalitydemonstration. When they are consciously related to the world of causes and arethe result of “right and conscious direction” of the emanating centre, the soul,then the personality forces become subject to the diffusion of the soul energiesand the personality or form nature becomes magnetic in a different manner, andso attracts to itself energies of a higher and more dynamic plane to the oneswith which the man has been concerned hitherto and which he has learned tocontrol and use; in other cases, the soul energies intensify certain of thepersonality forces and the effect of the exoteric planets is supplemented by anincreasingly steady inflow of the energies [141] of the esoteric planets, andthese begin to have a dominantly esoteric effect. In Capricorn, for instance,the influence of Saturn is both exoteric and esoteric; in Taurus, Vulcan hasboth an esoteric and hierarchical effect, whilst in Leo the Sun rules allthree—the exoteric, the esoteric and the hierarchical life. This we will studysomewhat later in this section and when we come to the consideration of theconstellation Leo. Planetary influences are unusually potent in Aquarius duringthis world cycle because it is, in a peculiar way, a culminating sign for themajority of people who proceed from Aries to Pisces upon the Fixed Cross. A rarefew consummate the experience of life upon the three Crosses in the sign Pisces,and so become world saviours. They know then, and only then, the highest aspectof the first ray as it expresses itself through the activity of Death. The bulk,however, of the world initiates climax their experience in Aquarius and becomeliberated world servers. They turn their backs upon all further progress forthemselves in this cycle and on all satisfaction of their own spiritualaspiration and become carriers of the water of life to humanity, joining thusthe ranks of the Hierarchy. Those who achieve in Pisces and make the higher andfurther grade in their development pass into that centre to which we have giventhe name of Shamballa, but the bulk of the initiates and disciples remainattached to the second centre, that of the Hierarchy of Service.Aquarius is pre-eminently a sign of constant movement, of changing activity andrecurrent mutations, and the symbol for the sign is expressive of this state ofactivity. It is, therefore, a sign in which the significance of cycles ismastered and understood by the initiate. The results of the valley experience(to use the well-known language of the mystics of all ages) and of the mountaintop with its vision [142] and light, are very vividly depicted by the sign. TheAquarian can experience the depths of depression and of self-depreciation or hecan know and pass through the exaltation of the soul and the sense of spiritualpower which soul control gives, and know them to be the interplay and the actionand reaction which are necessary for growth and comprehension. The law of suchaction and reaction is the law with which he works.In Leo, a man's centre and point of consciousness is himself; he turns uponhimself and revolves entirely upon his own axis and in respect and relation tohimself, and is all the time the self-centred individual, consecrating allthought, time and service to his own well being and personal interests. But inAquarius, the polar opposite of Leo and its sign of consummation, he becomesoutgoing; there is no centre or circle of circumscribed influence but only twooutgoing lines of energy, pouring from him into the world of men. Theself-conscious individual in Leo becomes the conscious server in Aquarius, andthis is well expressed for us in the symbols of these two signs. The Aquarian isconsecrated to group service and to the welfare of humanity. The averageAquarian upon the Mutable Cross will be, for instance, a faithful employee, theadherent and worker in some firm or business within whose limits all hisinterests are confined and to whose welfare all he has is consecrated. Upon theFixed Cross this consecration to others becomes world service.Aquarius, we are told, governs the blood system and its circulation. By means ofthe blood, the life force is distributed throughout the entire human body. Itis, therefore, symbolic of the task of the liberated Aquarian who dispensesspiritual life throughout the fourth kingdom in nature. The Aquarian influencesare felt also as life-giving [143] in other forms of planetary life and otherkingdoms in nature but with these we will not deal as we are confining ourattention to humanity.Aquarius, as you know, is one of the arms of the Fixed Cross. This Cross isoutstandingly the Cross of Discipleship and of the three major initiations inconnection with which it might be pointed out that:1. In Taurus—Desire is transmuted into aspiration, darkness gives place to lightand illumination, the eye of the Bull is opened which is the spiritual thirdeye, or the “single eye” of the New Testament. “If thine eye be single,” saidthe Christ, “thy whole body shall be full of light.” This single eye takes theplace of the two eyes of the personal self. The attention of the man becomesfocussed upon spiritual attainment. He treads the Path of Discipleship.2. In Leo—The self-centred man becomes eventually the soul in life expressionand focussed on the achievement of the spiritual goal of selflessness. In thissign, he undergoes preparation for the first initiation and takes it also inthis sign, or under this sign when it is the rising sign, becoming “the Lion whoseeks his prey,” that is the personality who becomes the captive of the soul.3. In Scorpio—In this sign, the disciple undergoes those tests which will enablehim to take the second initiation and demonstrate that the desire nature issubdued and conquered and that the lower nature is (by being lifted up in theair, i.e. into heaven) capable of reaching the goal for this world period, andthat from the earthy foundations of Scorpio the personality can be so testedthat it shows fitness for the world service demanded in Aquarius. This isbeautifully expressed for us in the [144] legend of Hercules, the Sun-God whoovercomes the nine-headed Hydra or serpent of desire by being forced to hisknees and from that position of humility lifts up the serpent into the air, andthen deliverance comes.4. In Aquarius—In this sign, the long effort of the soul is consummated andconcludes the experience of the disciple upon the Fixed Cross. The man thentakes the third initiation and becomes free from personality control, taking thenext two initiations upon the Cardinal Cross.I might here give you the following names for the three crosses taken from theancient archives and therefore difficult to translate:1. The Mutable Cross—The Cross of changing and absorbed Experience. This is theplace of action and of reaction, of karmic control and of response to impactsleading to the awakening of consciousness to the nature of the goal ahead.2. The Fixed Cross—The Cross of Transmutation. Desire becomes aspiration, andselfishness is transformed into selflessness.3. The Cardinal Cross—The Cross of Transcendence. Personality life and form lifeand planetary life no longer control. The man stands free.Substance, the ocean of life, water, the symbol of desire and the impulse toincarnate are transmuted into soul light and light substance and the urge totread consciously the path of return, plus the longing to serve. Desire isdeveloped and focussed in Taurus when the man is upon the Mutable Cross andprogressing around the zodiac. It is reoriented and repolarised in Taurus whenthe man has mounted the [145] Fixed Cross and is eventually relinquished in thatsign. In the polar opposite of Taurus, Scorpio, the personality is humbled andbrought to grips with the soul; in that sign the personality is “occultly killedand then resurrected into air and light,” in order to become from that momentthe servant of the soul. In Leo, the individual awakens to his own identity,concentrates his purpose, learns the lessons and uses of selfishness (for thatis one of the best ways to learn and to discover that it is contrary to the lawsof the soul) and is eventually so cornered by the life processes that he becomesaware of the futility of self- interest. In Aquarius, the man awakens to thebeauty of group life, group interest and his individual responsibility towardsthe group and begins to live his life and to spend himself in the service ofhumanity.In connection with the question of consciousness, students would find itilluminating to study the subject along the following lines:1. Subjective latent consciousness . . . . . . . . In Aries2. The consciousness of duality . . . . . . . . . In Gemini3. Mass consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In Cancer4. Individual self-consciousness . . . . . . . . . .In Leo5. Equilibrised consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . In Libra6. Group consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In AquariusThe distinction between exoteric and esoteric astrology lies in just suchrecognitions as listed above. Exoteric astrology deals with the characteristicsand qualities of the personality and of the form aspects, and also with theevents, happenings, circumstances and the conditioning environment which appearin the personal horoscope, indicative of planetary control and not of solarcontrol. Esoteric astrology concerns itself primarily with the unfoldment ofconsciousness, [146] with the impacts which awaken it to the peculiar “gifts” ofany particular sign and ray endowment and with the reaction of the man and hisconsequent enrichment through his response to the influence of a sign, workingthrough the esoteric planets from the angle of humanitarian awareness, ofdiscipleship and of initiation. This deals basically with his experiences fromthe angle of the three Crosses, which involves first, mutation, then direction,and finally initiation. Increasingly, these three Crosses will take a prominentplace in astrological delineation.We come now to a very interesting point in connection with Aquarius. There isapparently no planet which is either exalted or “falls” in this sign. The onlyplanet affected is the Sun, whose power is lessened. What is the symbolicsignificance of this? It consists in the relation of Aquarius to Capricorn andof the Fixed Cross to the Cardinal Cross and of the third initiation to thosesucceeding it, of the point of balance reached between Pisces and Capricorn,which focus in Aquarius. I am not here considering the orthodox mathematical orastronomical reasons, for they are, in reality, dependent upon the subjectiveand spiritual reasons, and it is with these that we are concerned. One of thefacts which will emerge in our consciousness as we study along these esotericlines is that all the outer indications do not indicate truth but only point theway to the subjective realities of which the outer facts are but the illusorysymbols. Ponder upon this and keep an open mind.No planet is exalted in Aquarius and no planet falls in this sign because thetrue Aquarian—after due experience upon the Mutable Cross and the FixedCross—has reached a point of balance. He is held by none of the pairs ofopposites but uses them both for spiritual ends. He is hindered neither by earthnor water (Capricorn and Pisces); [147] he has surmounted the tests of both theprocesses of incarnation and initiation and so stands free, distributing energyand life, symbolised by the two wavy lines. It is interesting to bear in mindthat in the progress of the soul, as far as humanity is concerned , one of thefour signs of each Cross is of more importance than the others. Each sign ofeach of the three Crosses is related to one of the four kingdoms in nature andthe preponderance of the ray influence pours through the sign to the kingdomunder consideration. In connection with humanity, the sign of importance on thethree Crosses is as follows:1. The Mutable Cross . . . . . . . . . . Pisces2. The Fixed Cross . . . . . . . . . . . . Scorpio3. The Cardinal Cross . . . . . . . . . . CapricornIn Aquarius, the initiate consummates all that has been achieved in Leo throughthe influence of the Sun, for in Leo there is an almost unique condition wherehumanity is concerned as the Sun governs all expressions—exoteric, esoteric andhierarchical. It rules the personality, the soul and the fourth CreativeHierarchy. Hence the Sun (the physical Sun) is lessened in its power inAquarius. The third initiation has been undergone and the light of thepersonality has been “put out” or dimmed by the light of the subjective Sun,influencing the soul. There is much to think out here but little more can bedirectly indicated, as the curious fact of this triple control by a planetconstitutes one of the mysteries of initiation. It is tied up with the relationbetween Leo and Aquarius, for Leo is unusual in having all its ruling influencesconcentrated through the medium of one planet. Leo indicates the height ofachievement of the human soul. We are apt to think that initiation andliberation are the achievement of the human kingdom [148] and the attainment ofhumanity. This is not the case. Initiation is an achievement and an attainedsuccess of the soul which has at last succeeded in dominating the personalityand in manifesting its true nature and character, in spite of the personalityand the antagonism of the human being intent upon his own purposes. It isliterally the attainment of certain desired objectives, towards which the unitsof the fifth kingdom in nature have been working for aeons, and expresses theend of the enforced task and sacrifice and planetary service. This achievementreaches its goal at the third initiation and from that time on man, liberatedand free, serves from free choice and as a soul, conscious of intent and purposeupon the physical plane.The decanates in Aquarius are governed (according to Alan Leo) by Saturn,Mercury and Venus, and the effect that they will produce upon human affairs andworld conditions is already beginning to appear. Saturn is the planet ofdiscipleship and of opportunity; it is exceedingly active today, presenting tothe world disciple those difficult situations and crises which will involve freechoice, discriminative pioneering, wise response and correct decision, thusbringing about the destruction of that which hinders without the relinquishingof any true values of which humanity may be aware. The individual disciple hasalways been faced with these conditioning and releasing circumstances, and todayhumanity itself is in the same position. We stand at the gateway of the newworld, of the new age and its new civilizations, ideals and culture.Saturn, having offered opportunity and proffered us a choice to bring about theneeded changes and to destroy that which holds back the free expression of thesoul, eventually stands aside in order to let His great Brother, Mercury, spreadthe light of the soul—intuitive and illuminating—[149] upon the situation, tointerpret for us, through our own illumined minds, the significance of eventsand to relate the old and the new, the past and the future through the light ofthe present.Hence, the subjective usefulness of the present general trend towards meditationprocesses which bring about the capacity to be “impressed from on high”(technically understood) and to be illumined by the light of the soul.When the task of Saturn and of Mercury has been accomplished, then during thethird decanate, Venus, which is the union of heart and mind, will usher in thelong hoped for era of love-wisdom, of brotherhood and of expressed brotherlyrelationships. Opportunity— Illumination—Brotherhood: these are the gifts thatShamballa is planning to confer upon mankind during the Aquarian Age, if manwill but prepare for them, accept them, and use them. Only the future will makeclear man's reaction.According to other astrologers, the three decanates are governed by Venus,Mercury and the Moon. You can here see the relation of astrology to the normalor to the reversed wheel of life. The Moon which here takes the place of Saturnhides the planet Uranus. In this case Uranus, the occult planet, stands forexoteric science which penetrates into the hidden side of form life, and thus wehave the period wherein man is not alert enough or conscious enough to seizeupon opportunity and turn it to esoteric or soul ends, but can identify himselfwith the more advanced aspects of form. The energy which produces opportunity,illumination, and brotherly love as expressed and attained upon the Fixed Cross,demonstrates upon the Mutable or Common Cross as difficulty, the versatile andvolatile mind (unstable and dark) and as sex.This appears clearly in the words spoken to the man [150] upon the Mutable Crossas he passes through an Aquarian cycle. The words are: “And the Word said, Letdesire in form be ruler,” for desire becomes gained knowledge and the knowledgeof that which is hidden at any stage upon the path of evolution relates theindividual to Uranus. When the man is upon the Fixed Cross, the words comeforth: “Water of life am I, poured forth for thirsty men.” The implications areso clear that there is no need for me to be more explicit or to elaborate thetheme.We shall next consider Capricorn at some length. These three studies of Pisces,Aquarius and Capricorn will be slightly longer than the succeeding ones as Ihave been laying the foundation of what I have to say under our fifth point: TheThree Crosses. We shall have brought out certain considerations in connectionwith them that will be of value; Pisces is part of the Mutable Cross, Aquariusof the Fixed Cross, and Capricorn of the Cardinal Cross, and there will,therefore, be no need to repeat in such detail what I have here said when we aredealing with the other signs. These three signs are beginning signs or finalsigns, according to the state of the wheel of life. They also sum up or initiatethe activities of the other nine signs which are fundamentally strictly humansigns and synthesise the results of experience upon the three Crosses.We shall be able now to cover our present thesis anent the philosophicalimplications of the Great Wheel of the Zodiac far more rapidly, as I can nowleave what else remains to be said in connection with the three Crosses until Icome to that part of our Section VI. There I shall have much of interest topoint out. I have dealt with these three Crosses at some length whilst we werecovering these first three signs of the zodiacal wheel as it revolves fromAries, through Pisces, to Taurus. Each of these three is found on [151] one ofthe Crosses and thus in themselves and in their relationship they constitute acomplete unit. It is interesting to note how these three signs are either thoseof commencement (upon the Mutable Cross) or of consummation (upon the FixedCross). In the case where they stand for beginning we have:1. Aries . . . . . 1st Aspect . . . . Movement outward into incarnation. latent.The Will to manifest. Experience upon the Cardinal Cross. 2. Pisces . . . . 2ndAspect . . . . Desire for form existence. The Love or desire latent. formaterial things. Constant mutation. Experience upon the Mutable or Common Cross.3. Aquarius . . 3rd Aspect . . . . Consecration to the service of the lowerlatent. self. Selfishness. Experience upon the Fixed Cross.When these three signs form the end of the cycle of expression upon the reversedwheel, then you have:1. Aquarius . . 3rd Aspect . . . . Consecration to the service of the Whole.expressed. The death or negation of all personality selfishness. Culmination ofexperience upon the Fixed Cross. 2. Pisces . . . . . 2nd Aspect . . . .Emergence of a world saviour. expressed. Death of all separative desire andlove, even spiritual longing and aspiration. Culmination of experience upon theMutable Cross. 3. Aries . . . . . 1st Aspect . . . . Appearance of the will tocooperate with expressed. the Plan. The death of Self-will. Culmination ofexperience upon the Cardinal Cross.The same basic mode of considering the three Crosses can be carried out withGemini, Taurus, Aries or the reverse: Aries, Taurus and Gemini, rememberingalways that the Mutable Cross governs the wheel in ordinary progress and theFixed Cross governs it on the reversed progress during discipleship. TheCardinal Cross in reality governs [152] both processes but this is onlyunderstood when initiation has taken place.1. Aries—Governs the Path of Discipleship. The Will to return to the Source.Determination to achieve liberation. The emanating cause of the changes upon theMutable and Fixed Crosses.2. Taurus—The desire to overcome desire. The longing for liberation.Transmutation of desire into Love.3. Gemini—The fusion of the opposites; the intelligent work of at-one-ment;synthesis.Upon the ordinary wheel, these signs bring about:1. Gemini—Experience of the pairs of opposites. Pronounced and separativeduality. The interplay between the Twins: Soul and form natures.2. Taurus—The refocussing of the lower desires prior to another circling of theGreat Wheel in search of personality satisfaction. The Prodigal Son journeysinto a far country.3. Aries—Again the beginning as well as the end.It should be remembered that Aries is definitely that divine manifestation towhich Christ referred when He said “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and theend.” The significance of this can, however, only be grasped when theexperiences of the Mutable Cross and of the Fixed Cross have been transcendedand the Cardinal Cross has been consciously mounted after the third initiation.This is the “wheel which turns upon itself and rolls from north to south andthen from east to west as it progresses onward and, in one moment of time, thisit does.” This is a symbolic way of expressing the united activity of all thestates of consciousness, achieved upon the first two wheels, and which [153]life experience, in many rounds of the zodiac, has brought to the initiate; itmeans likewise that type of awareness which transcends even that of the ChristHimself and for which He and the Buddha are undergoing preparation. Theexperience of the Cardinal Cross (concerning as it does cosmic unfoldment)transcends all possible awareness, gained upon the other two Crosses and forwhich they have prepared the initiate. It might be stated that1. The Mutable Cross, in due time and when its lessons are assimilated, bringsabout planetary awareness.2. The Fixed Cross brings about systemic awareness.3. The Cardinal Cross brings about cosmic awareness.CAPRICORN, THE GOATThis is one of the most difficult signs about which to write, for it, as youknow, is the most mysterious sign of all the twelve. It is the sign of the Goatwhich seeks its sustenance in the most rocky and arid of the world's places andit, therefore, relates man to the mineral kingdom; it is also the sign of theCrocodiles which live half in the water and half on dry land; it is spirituallythe sign of the Unicorn which is the “fighting and triumphant creature” of theancient myths. Under the symbolism of the above creatures, this sign gives us arather complete picture of man with his feet upon the earth, yet running freeand climbing to the heights of worldly ambition or of spiritual aspiration insearch of what he realises (at any particular time) to be his major need. As theGoat, he is man, the earthly, human, greedy seeker after the satisfaction ofdesire, or man, the equally selfish aspirant hunting for the satisfaction of hisaspiration. This sign portrays to us man, an ambitious animal in two senses ofthe word: in the early stage upon [154] the Mutable Cross, man, the blend ofdesire (water) and the animal nature (earth), and upon the reversed wheel, man,the blend of soul and form. It gives us the picture also of the triumphantinitiate, the “unicorn of God,” the symbol of the unicorn, with its one hornout-thrust like a single spear upon his brow instead of the two horns of thescavenging goat.It is interesting to study the three signs in which the animals have horns:Aries , the downturned horns of the ram, signifying the coming intomanifestation, the involutionary cycle and the experience of the Cardinal Crossas it expresses the Will-to-manifest of God. Taurus , the up-turned horns of theBull with the circle below, depicting the push of man, the Bull of God, towardsthe goal of illumination and the emergence of the soul from bondage with the twohorns (duality) protecting the “eye of light” in the centre of the Bull'sforehead; this is “the single eye” of the New Testament which makes the “wholebody to be full of light.” Then Capricorn , the Goat, related particularly andclosely to Aries, but hiding (as an esoteric blind) the symbolism of the Unicornin which the two horns and the single eye are blended and depicted by the longstraight horn of the unicorn in the centre of the forehead.Behind all the above lies the dual mystery of Leo, for Leo is—as far as humanityis concerned—the key or clue to the entire zodiac and around the constellationLeo two great mysteries are found:1. The mystery of the Sphinx , connected with the relation of Leo and Virgo, andtied up with the secret of the solar Angels. This is not the mystery of soul andform, but the mystery of the higher and the lower mind and their relation toeach other. [155]2. The Mystery of the Lion and the Unicorn . This secret is preserved for us inthe ancient nursery rhyme about the “lion and the unicorn going up to town,” andcontains in a peculiar way the secret of initiation and the “going up” of thehuman being to the portal of admittance into the Hierarchy as well as the“mystic raising” of which Masonry holds the key. This deals with the emergenceof the consciousness of the initiate (white and one-pointed) and the defeat ofthe king of beasts (the personality) leading to the triumph of group and worldconsciousness, of selflessness and illumination over self-consciousness andselfishness. In the true rendition of this ancient myth the king of beasts isblinded and killed by the piercing of his eye and heart by the long horn of theunicorn.The symbol of this sign is indecipherable and intentionally so. It is sometimescalled the “signature of God.” I must not attempt to interpret it for you,partly because it has never yet been correctly drawn and partly because itscorrect delineation and the ability of the initiate to depict it produces aninflow of force which would not be desirable, except after due preparation andunderstanding. It is far more potent than the pentagon and leaves the initiate“unprotected.”In an ancient astrological treatise which has never yet seen the light of daybut which will be some day discovered when the right time has arrived, therelation between the horned animals of the zodiac is thus described:“The Ram, the Scapegoat and the sacred Goat are Three in One and One in Three.The Ram becomes the second and the second is the third. The Ram that breeds andfertilises all; the Scapegoat, in [156] the wilderness, redeems that all; thesacred Goat that merges in the Unicorn and lifts impaled upon his golden hornthe vanquished form—in these the mystery lies hid.”It here becomes apparent that three mysteries are hidden in the three hornedsigns:1. The mystery of God the Father . . . . . . . . . .Creation2. The mystery of God the Son . . . . . . . . . . . .Redemption3. The mystery of God the Holy Spirit . . . . . .LiberationIt might also be pointed out here that it is the will of the Father aspect,manifesting through Aries, that governs Shamballa; the loving desire of the Sonwhich attracts to the Hierarchy; and the permeating, intelligent activity of theHoly Spirit which animates that centre of divine life which we call humanity.Therefore we have:Shamballa . . . . . . .Hierarchy . . . . . . . . HumanityWill . . . . . . . . . . . Love . . . . . . . . . . . .IntelligenceAries . . . . . . . . . . Taurus . . . . . . . . . . CapricornIn both their higher and their lower aspects these signs hold the secret of the“horns of strife and the horn of plenty subjected to and guarded by the horn oflife.” Again, an ancient proverb runs: “The Ram—when it has become theScapegoat, has sought illumination as the Bull of God and has climbed themountain top in the semblance of the Goat—changes its shape into the Unicorn.Great is the hidden key.” If the symbolism is carried a little further, it mightbe stated that:1. The Ram leads us into the creative life of Earth and into the darkness ofmatter. This is the blue of midnight. [157]2. The Bull leads into the places of desire in search of “wrathfulsatisfaction.” This is the red of greed and anger, changing eventually into thegolden light of illumination.3. The Goat leads us into arid ways in search of food and water. This is the“need for green,” but the Goat is equal also to climbing to the mountain top.This is the experience of the Mutable Cross in connection with these threesigns. Upon the Fixed Cross:1. Eventually the Ram becomes the Scapegoat and the will of God in love andsalvage is demonstrated.2. The Bull becomes the bestower of light, and the darkness of the earlier cycleis lightened by the Bull.3. The Goat becomes the Unicorn, and leads to victory. The Crocodile, the Goatand the Unicorn depict three stages of man's unfoldment.Aries, Taurus, and Capricorn are the great transformers under the great creativeplan. They are in the nature of catalysts. Each of them opens a door into one ofthe three divine centres of expression which are the symbols in the body of theplanetary Logos of the three higher centres in man: the head, the heart and thethroat.Aries opens the door into Shamballa, when the experience of Taurus and Capricornhas been undergone.Taurus opens the door into the Hierarchy when the significance of Gemini and Leois understood and the first two initiations can therefore he taken.Capricorn opens the door into the Hierarchy in a higher aspect when the lastthree initiations can be undergone and the significance of Scorpio and of Virgois understood. [158]In these signs and their relationship upon the Fixed Cross lies hid the mysteryof Makara and of the Crocodiles.The keynotes of this sign are all indicative of a crystallisation process. Thisconcretising faculty of Capricorn can be considered in several ways.First of all, Capricorn is an earth sign, and in it we have expressed thedensest point of concrete materialisation of which the human soul is capable.Man is then “of the earth, earthy” and is what the New Testament calls “thefirst Adam.” In this sense, Capricorn holds in itself the seeds of death andfinality—the death which takes place finally and eventually in Pisces. Ponder onthis. When crystallisation has reached a certain degree of density and so-called“hardness,” it is easily shattered and destroyed and man, born in Capricorn,then brings about his own destruction; this is due to his fundamentallymaterialistic nature, plus the “blows of fate” which are the enactments of thelaw of karma. Again and again, a certain measure of concreteness is achieved,only again to undergo destruction, prior to the release of the life and therebuilding of the form.Secondly, Capricorn is ever the sign of conclusion, and of this the mountain topis frequently (though not always) the symbol, for it marks the point beyondwhich further ascent in any particular life cycle is not possible. Capricorn is,therefore, the sign of what has been called esoterically “periodic arresting.”Progress becomes impossible under the existing forms, and there has to be thedescent into the valley of pain, despair and death before a fresh attempt toscale the heights takes place. The attempt today to climb Mount Everest isamazingly symbolic, and it is being watched with much interest by the Hierarchy,for in this effort we see the attempt of humanity to achieve the top of [159]the mountain whose height has hitherto defeated all efforts. But—and this is thematter of moment and of interest—when humanity emerges into the light andrelative glory of the new civilisation, they will at the same time conquer thislast remaining summit. That which is of the densest materiality and which is theconsummation of earthly grandeur will remain—but it will be beneath the feet ofhumanity.Thirdly, Capricorn is, as a consequence of all the above, the sign in which isinaugurated a new cycle of effort, whether this effort is in connection with theindividual man or with the initiate. Effort, strain, struggle, the fight withthe forces native to the underworld, or the strenuous conditions entailed by thetests of discipleship or initiation—these are distinctive of experience inCapricorn.In ancient days, as you may perchance have heard, there were only ten signs,and—at that time—Capricorn marked the end of the zodiacal wheel, and not Piscesas is at this time the case. The two signs of Aquarius and Pisces were notincorporated in the signs for the simple and sufficient reason that humanitycould not respond to their peculiar influences; the vehicles of contact and themechanisms for responses were not adequately developed. Originally, there wereeight signs; then there were ten and now twelve.1. In Lemurian days, during the early period of animal man and before humanityappeared on earth, in the interim period of development, eight signs influencedthe planet and the kingdoms of nature found upon it. There was no response tothe influences of Leo and Virgo . The mystery of the Sphinx did not exist andthese two signs were not then part of the zodiacal wheel. Then individualisationtook place and the seed of Christhood [160] was planted in man and these twosigns began to influence humanity, and gradually that influence was recognisedand the zodiac was then known to have ten signs. The Mutable Cross dominated,but it was then the Tau, for Pisces was lacking and only Gemini, Virgo andSagittarius were evidenced. Aries to Capricorn marked the circle of experience.2. In Atlantean days, man had become so responsive to the planetary and solarinfluence that the door of initiation into hierarchical experience was openedand two more signs were added. These two signs were the higher correspondencesof Leo and Virgo and were the polar opposites of these two: Aquarius and Pisces.Their influence became active and effective and thus they formed part of thezodiacal wheel because man began to respond to their potencies. It then becamepossible for the Fixed Cross to function esoterically in the life of humanity,and the first reversals of the wheel in the life of the advanced men of theperiod took place. It was this reversal which was the true cause of the greatcontest or battle between the Lords of the Dark Face (as they are called in TheSecret Doctrine ) and the Lords of Light—a contest which is today persisting.Certain men then reached the stage of discipleship wherein they couldconsciously mount the Fixed Cross and be prepared for a major initiation. Thisthe Forces of Materiality and of Obstruction (as they are sometimes called)fought and the battle was fought out and conditioned in the sign Scorpio.3. Today, in Aryan times, a similar conflict upon a higher turn of the spiral istaking place. The reason is that certain world disciples and initiates havereached the point in their unfoldment wherein they are ready to [161] mount theCardinal Cross and take some of the higher initiations. So the conflict is onbetween humanity (under the control of the Lords of Materiality) and theHierarchy (under the control of the Forces of Light and Love), and right beforeour eyes the battle is being waged. The influences of the twelve signs of thezodiac (particularly of seven of the signs) are being engaged, for today men ofall types and rays are responsive to their influences and are implicated in someform or another in the affair.You will note, therefore, that if the concentrated forces of the Cardinal Crossare definitely potent at this time (as they are) the battle is terrific,because,1. Humanity, as a whole, is in a state of turmoil, prior to a great step forwardin self-conscious unfoldment, and in the expression of the sense ofresponsibility which is the first flower and fruit of self-conscious awareness.This fact is responsible for sweeping into the conflict in a peculiar andpronounced manner, the forces of Cancer (involutionary in nature), of Leo(concerned with individualisation), and of Gemini (expressive of man's essentialduality). You find, therefore, today, the activity of the mass consciousness ofCancer which is indicative of the activity of the Cardinal Cross in theinvolutionary stage; the self-consciousness of man as indicated by Leo, the mosthuman sign of all, and indicative of the Fixed Cross; and Gemini, which givesthe sense of the dual nature of man —human and divine—which is the goal of theconsciousness of experience upon the Mutable Cross. You consequently have a signin each of the three Crosses particularly active today in influencing the massesof men everywhere. A little [162] study of world conditions, as far as man isconcerned, will prove this.2. The disciples of the world today and advanced humanity are equally in a stateof turmoil. They are being tested and tried, prior to taking a major stepforward—in some cases this will be the taking of the first initiation and inothers the second. This is brought about by, and brings in, the forces ofTaurus, Leo and Scorpio, plus a general pervasive influence coming from Gemini.You have here three signs found in the Fixed Cross and one in the Mutable Crossconditioning and affecting the world disciples, and all of them of terrificimportance and potency today, owing to the stage of development and thesensitivity of the disciples and world initiates.3. The initiates, in their turn, are being subjected to the impact of energiesfrom Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces—an inflow of force from each of the threeCrosses. These three forces enable the initiates to take the third initiation.It will interest you to note that average humanity is, therefore, subjected tothe influences of three major signs at this time and conditioned by potenciescoming from each of the three Crosses. These present men with the responsibilityof choice, evoking their free will, their trend towards self-determination andtheir established decision at this time of world crisis. You will note that theworld disciples are related to the mass of men through their responsiveness toinfluences emanating from Gemini, and to each other through Scorpio. Thisproduces in them the capacity to respond to test, to a sense of the vision(through the illumined eye of Taurus) and to use their power of individuality[163] through a developed personality and through the potency of Leo. Initiatesare brought into relation to the world disciples through the constellationScorpio, to the hierarchical centre through Capricorn, and to the mass throughPisces, the sign of all world saviours.Seven constellations are, therefore, predominantly brought into a closecombination at the present moment of crisis and are responsible for worldaffairs as they are found today:Cancer . . . . . . The Cardinal Cross. “Both Gates stand wide.” Capricorn . . .Taurus . . . . . . The Fixed Cross. “The Disciples dominate the world.” Leo . .. . . . . . Scorpio . . . . . Gemini . . . . . The Mutable Cross. “Worldsalvation is possible today.” Pisces . . . . . .The exoteric and the esoteric planetary rulers of Capricorn are the same, andSaturn rules the career of the man in this sign, no matter whether he is on theordinary or the reversed wheel, or whether he is on the Mutable or the FixedCross. When he has taken the third initiation and can consciously mount theCardinal Cross, he is then released from the ruling of Saturn and comes underthe influence of Venus, who is governor or ruler of the Hierarchy which is thatof the Crocodiles. A reference to the tabulation heretofore given will showthis. It is only when a man is upon the Cardinal Cross that the significance,purpose and potencies of the Creative Hierarchies become clear to [164] him andthe “doors of entrance” into all of them stand wide open. On the Mutable Crossand on the Fixed Cross we have the so-called green ray, controlling not only thedaily life of karmic liability upon the path of evolution, but also controllingthe experiences and processes of evolution. The reason for this is thatCapricorn is an earth sign and because the third and fifth rays workpre-eminently through this sign, embodying the third major aspect of divinity,active intelligence plus that of its subsidiary power, the fifth Ray of Mind.These pour through Capricorn to Saturn and to Venus and so reach our planet, theEarth. Saturn is one of the most potent of the four Lords of Karma and forcesman to face up to the past, and in the present to prepare for the future. Suchis the intention and purpose of karmic opportunity. From certain angles, Saturncan be regarded as the planetary Dweller on the Threshold, for humanity as awhole has to face that Dweller as well as the Angel of the Presence, and in sodoing discover that both the Dweller and the Angel are that complex dualitywhich is the human family. Saturn, in a peculiar relation to the sign Gemini,makes this possible. Individual man makes this discovery and faces the twoextremes whilst in the sign Capricorn; the fourth and fifth Creative Hierarchiesdo the same thing in Libra.Through Saturn and Venus, therefore, Capricorn is connected with Libra and alsowith Gemini and Taurus, and these four constellations—Taurus, Gemini, Libra andCapricorn—constitute a potent quaternary of energies and between them producethose conditions and situations which will enable the initiate to demonstratehis readiness and capacity for initiation. They are called the “Guardians of theFour Secrets.” [165]Taurus —Guards the secret of light and confers illumination upon the initiate.Gemini —Guards the mystery or secret of duality and presents the initiate with aword which leads to the fusion of the greater pairs of opposite.Libra —Guards the secret of balance, of equilibrium and finally speaks the wordwhich releases the initiate from the power of the Lords of Karma.Capricorn —Guards the secret of the soul itself and this it reveals to theinitiate at the time of the third initiation. This is sometimes called the“secret of the hidden glory.”Through certain other of the planetary rulers, through the medium of which thethird and fifth rays work, Capricorn is connected with other constellationsbesides the four above mentioned, but these four are for our purposes the mostimportant. Students can work out the remaining interlocking energies forthemselves, if they so desire, by relating the rays, planetary rulers andconstellations through reference to the tabulations already given. The subjectis, however, definitely confusing to the beginner, and it is for this reasonthat I am dealing here with the philosophy and symbolism of the signs first ofall, so as to familiarise the student with the general scheme and the universalbroad interlocking.The third and fifth rays are peculiarly active upon the Path of Discipleship,just as the sixth and fourth are dominant upon the Path of Evolution and thefirst and seventh upon the Path of Initiation. The second ray controls anddominates all the other rays, as you well know. [166].Path Rays Planets Constellations Evolution . . . . . . . 6 and 4 . . . Mars.Mercury. Aries. Gemini. Cancer. Virgo. Scorpio. Discipleship . . . . . 3 and 5 .. . Venus. Saturn. Gemini. Sagittarius. Capricorn. Initiation . . . . . . . . 1and 7 . . . Vulcan. Uranus. Taurus. Libra. Pisces. Pluto.You will notice from the above tabulation one or two interesting points. Theseshould be carefully considered by all astrologers after determining theapproximate place of the subject upon the evolutionary path in one or other ofits three divisions. First, that the constellation Gemini appears twice onaccount of its close connection with the fourth Creative Hierarchy. Second, thatduring the period of the Mutable Cross five constellations are concerned withthe experience of man upon the path of daily life, of constant rebirths and ofkarmic difficulty. Four of them lead to Scorpio, in which sign comes the pointof the reversal of the Wheel.Third, that on the Path of Discipleship three constellations control and lead upto the activity of Capricorn, at which time initiation becomes possible.Fourth, on the Path of Initiation the activity of all the three Crosses is feltsimultaneously through the medium of the “released powers” of Taurus, Libra andPisces. You will note also that the first ray influence, expressing throughPluto and Vulcan, is only felt in a positive manner upon the Path ofDiscipleship. This first ray potency has only lately been experienced byhumanity as a whole as it neared the stage of being the world disciple, and vastnumbers relatively stood upon the Path of Discipleship and Probation. Hence therecent discovery of Pluto and the sensed power of Vulcan, veiled by the potencyof Mercury and hidden behind the planet.[167] Second ray influences and potencies are abidingly present and pour intoour planetary sphere and life, via the Sun (veiling a hidden planet) andJupiter. These sweep the forces of Leo, Sagittarius, Pisces, Aquarius and Virgointo and through our entire planet and all its kingdoms in nature.From the above few points, hints can be gathered together as to the interlockingforces of all the twelve constellations, as they pour into and through all thekingdoms in nature, carrying with them also not only their own individualpotencies but also those of the seven rays, focussed through the sacred andnon-sacred planets—the discovered and undiscovered planetary Lives. It has beenoccultly said that a vision of these powers and their many weaving lines (seenas rivers and streams of light) is given to the initiate from the mountain topof Capricorn, once that summit has been reached. It is at the Transfigurationinitiation that this vision appears before the eyes of the astounded disciple.The great experiences upon the various mountain tops as related in the Biblehave all to do with Capricorn. Moses, the Lawgiver on Mount Sinai, is Saturn inCapricorn imposing the law of karma upon the people. A clue to the significanceof the Jewish people as a karmic clearing house can be found here. Ponder onthose words “a karmic clearing house.” The Mount of Transfiguration in the NewTestament is Venus in Capricorn when love and mind and will meet in the personof the Christ, and “He was transfigured” before all men. At the same time, Hereceived the vision of the Father and of what He had to do as He “went up toJerusalem,” the place of death and likewise the city of peace. This Jerusalem isPisces. In Aquarius, Christ put His disciples in touch with the “man, bearing apitcher of water,” Aquarius, and in the upper room introduced them to union andunity under the symbolism of the [168] communion feast. For that feast, humanityis today preparing, as we saw when studying the last constellation. Theastrological significance of the New Testament is as yet little understood.Christ was born in Capricorn, fulfilled the law under Saturn, initiated the eraof intelligent brotherhood under Venus and is the perfect example of theCapricornian initiate who becomes the world Server in Aquarius, and the worldSaviour in Pisces, thus completing the round of the zodiac and able to saytriumphantly in Pisces “It is finished.”The polar opposite to Capricorn is Cancer and, as you have been taught, thesetwo signs are the two great Gates of the zodiac—one opening the door intoincarnation, into mass life, and into human experience, whilst the other opensthe door into the life of the spirit, into the life of the Kingdom of God, thelife and purposes of the Hierarchy of our planet. Cancer admits the soul intothe world centre which we call Humanity. Capricorn admits the soul intoconscious participation in the life of that world centre which we call theHierarchy. Libra admits the soul into the world centre which we call Shamballa,for it is the polar opposite of Aries which is the place of beginnings. Librademonstrates the perfect balance of spirit and matter which first came togetherin Aries. This balance and this relation of the great opposites, spirit andmatter, is symbolised for us in the personality situation of balancing the pairsof opposites on the astral plane, and finding between them the “narrowrazor-edged path” which leads the man into the kingdom of the soul. As manpasses around and around the zodiac in the ordinary manner, he continually andconsciously enters into life in Cancer, the constellation under which the Law ofRebirth is applied and administered. But it is only on the reversed zodiac thatthe man learns to pass with [169] equally conscious purpose through the gate ofCapricorn. Five times he has to pass through that Gate in full wakingconsciousness and these five happenings are frequently called the five majorinitiations. Viewing the fourth Creative Hierarchy as a whole, the appearanceand experiences of the life of the planetary Logos through the medium of thefive races—two past, one present, the Aryan, and two to come—are planetarycorrespondences to the five initiations. This is peculiarly interesting to studybecause at the time that any particular race comes into being both the doors inCancer and Capricorn stand wide open, being then occultly aligned.A study of the characteristics and qualities of the man who is born in the signCapricorn will reveal a great deal anent the human family because theCapricornian can express all the worst of which a man is capable and all thebest. It is a sign of extremes, and this because at the time there were only tensigns, Capricorn was the first on the ordinary wheel and the last on thereversed wheel. This is obvious. Esoterically, all world Saviours and Sun Godsare born in Capricorn but also the very worst type of man—hard, materialistic,cruel, proud, selfishly ambitious and egoistic. The head rules the heart in suchcases, whereas in the perfect example of the influences of Capricorn, head andheart are perfectly balanced.Capricorn rules the knees and this is symbolically true, for only when theCapricornian subject learns to kneel in all humility and with his knees upon therocky mountain top to offer his heart and life to the soul and to human service,can he be permitted to pass through the door of initiation and be entrusted withthe secrets of life. Only on his knees can he go through that door. As long ashe arrogantly stands where he has not earned the right to stand, he can [170]never safely be given the information which is imparted to all true initiates.The ancient mode of pilgrimage in India, by which the devotee passed orprogressed from one holy place to another upon his knees, is indicative of thisdeep need of the Capricornian for humility. India is ruled by Capricorn andIndia knows this truth. Though India has permitted the physical act to usurp theplace of a spiritual attitude, yet the symbolic meaning is eternally true. Whenthe man born in Capricorn can kneel in spirit and in truth, he is then ready forthe initiatory process upon the mountain top.The symbolism underlying the astrological fact that Mars is exalted inCapricorn, whilst the power of the Moon is lessened in that sign, and Jupiterand Neptune both fall, is significantly beautiful and instructive. Mars is theGod of War, the Producer of conflicts, and in this earthly sign Mars triumphs inthe early stages of the evolution of the fourth Creative Hierarchy and in thelife history of the undeveloped and average man. Materialism, the fight for thesatisfaction of personal ambitions, and the conflict with higher spiritualtendencies goes steadily forward, and this most material of all the signs is thebattleground of the old established order and habits and the new and higherinclinations and tendencies. India, governed by Capricorn, has been abattlefield right down the ages; Port Said, ruled by this sign, is synonymouswith the satisfaction of all the earthly and animal desires of the baser sortand is one of the wickedest cities in the world—a meeting place for the evil ofthree continents.But as evolution proceeds, the power of the Moon, which is the symbol and rulerof form, grows less and less, and the man upon the reversed wheel is steadilyfreeing himself from the control of matter. The attractive lure of that [171]which is material wanes increasingly. Jupiter, which has been the ruler ofPisces and also of Aquarius, falls in this sign. This fall must be studied fromtwo angles, for Jupiter in its lowest aspect gives the fulfilment of desire andsatisfied demand, whilst in its highest Jupiter is the outgoing expression oflove, which attracts magnetically to itself that which is desired—this time thegood of the whole. In Capricorn, therefore, Jupiter reaches its lowest point ofexpression in the densest material aspect, and then—as love and selflessnesstriumph—this lowest aspect vanishes and disappears. It is to the “fall” of thehighest aspect that the symbolism refers, and then later to the fall ordisappearance of all that is base and low. Love is fallen and blinded whendesire is rampant; desire vanishes when love triumphs. Neptune is often spokenof as falling in this sign and for the same reasons. Neptune is the God of thewaters, and is esoterically related to Pisces. It should be noted that bothNeptune and Jupiter are exalted in Cancer, the great sign wherein the desire forincarnation finds its fulfilment; the power of both is lessened in Virgo,wherein the first signs of the Christ consciousness are felt; both fall inCapricorn, when the Christ life and consciousness come to full fruition. Thereis much, as you can see, to be worked out along these three lines and the abovesuggestions will indicate how a comparative study and a philosophical researchcan be fruitfully made.In Capricorn we have the triumph of matter; it reaches its densest and mostconcrete expression; but this triumph is followed by that of spirit. There isfull expression of the earthly nature in Capricorn but also immense spiritualpossibilities. India, for instance, expresses a widespread degradation, but atthe same time the heights of spiritual attainment; a study of India—her history,characteristics [172] and spiritual qualities—will reveal much anent theinfluences and possibilities of this sign.The triplicity into which each sign is divided and which we call the decanatesis of particular interest in the case of Capricorn. As is the case in allcorrespondence, this triplicity can be related to the three aspects of God andman—spirit, soul and body. The central decanate is therefore of peculiar momentin our world period as it is concerned with the effect of the planetaryinfluences, the solar rays and the energy of the constellations upon the soul orthe consciousness aspect. This is the case whether we are considering man on theordinary wheel or man upon the reversed wheel. From the standpoint ofastrological interpretation and in the case where the astrologer is not surewhich way the wheel is turning, it is the only decanate with its ruler of whichhe can be sure. The influence of the ruler is, therefore, inevitable. This isstrikingly the case in connection with the sign Aquarius into which sign our sunis now entering, its three decanates, Saturn, Mercury and Venus, bringinginevitably difficulty, illumination and brotherly love. On the ordinary wheel,in all outer affairs, Saturn controls, and we consequently find ourselves todayin a state of chaos and trouble, but as far as the consciousness of the race isconcerned, Mercury is becoming increasingly active. A steady illumination istaking place and light is being thrown on all problems—light on government andpolitics through experiments and the study of great and basic ideologies; lighton the material nature of the world through all the many branches of science;light on humanity itself through education, philosophy and psychology. Thislight is spreading down to the very darkest places in our planet and its manyforms of life.Two sets of rulers for the three decanates are available. [173] According toAlan Leo, we have Saturn, Venus and Mercury. According to Sepharial we haveJupiter, Mars and the Sun. Of these two, the first is the more correct and themore esoteric. The true rulers are Saturn, Venus and the Sun. I would remind youthat Mercury and the Sun are interchangeable but that in this case the Sunstands exoterically for Mercury and esoterically for a hidden planet.Saturn relates Capricorn to the previous sign Aquarius, upon the ordinary wheel,and Jupiter, exoterically understood, relates Capricorn to Sagittarius upon thereversing wheel. It will be obvious to all esotericists that the Sun is theobvious ruler of the third decanate, veiling as it does a hidden and deeplysignificant planet and being that which reveals divinity at the time of thethird initiation. You will note how, in this great sign of initiation, Saturnreveals the nature of the third aspect of divinity, the nature of intelligentsubstance; Venus reveals the nature of the second aspect, which is consciousnessor intelligent love, whilst the Sun—the physical Sun and the heart of the Suntogether—reveals the synthesis of these two.The key words upon the ordinary wheel are “And the Word said: Let ambition ruleand let the door stand wide.” Here we have the key to the evolutionary urge, tothe secret of rebirth, and of that word which reverberates from Cancer toCapricorn. The door of initiation stands ever open, but for aeons of time manprefers the open door in Cancer. Ambition urges him on from life to life untilhe has discovered the worthlessness of all earthly gratification. Gradually thenspiritual ambition and a desire for liberation take the place of worldlyambition, and become an impelling impulse, until finally the moment arrives whena true sense of reality supersedes both earthly and spiritual ambition. The mancan then say with truth “Lost am I in light supernal, [174] yet on that light Iturn my back.” For him there remains now no goal but service. He thereforepasses back through the gate of Cancer, but with his consciousness held steadilyin the sign Aquarius. From being the world initiate in Capricorn he becomes anincarnated world server in Aquarius, and later a world saviour in Pisces.SAGITTARIUS, THE ARCHERThis sign is, as you know, a peculiarly human sign and is connected in adefinite manner with the appearance of humanity upon our Earth. There are threeof the zodiacal signs which are more closely connected with man than are any ofthe others. These are: Leo, Sagittarius and Aquarius. In one peculiar (but notyet provable) manner, they are related to the three aspects of body, soul andspirit. The following tabulation or concise statement of rather momentousimplications may serve to make this clearer:Leo Sagittarius Aquarius The Lion. The Centaur. The Water-Carrier. The Man. TheArcher. The Server. Self-consciousness. Focussed consciousness. Groupconsciousness. Physical nature. Emotional nature. Lower mental nature.Integrated man. Aspiring man. Intuitive mental man. Human soul. Spiritual humansoul. Spiritual soul. Individualisation. Discipleship. Initiation. Personality.Egoic focus. Monadic focus. The Fixed Cross. The Mutable Cross. The Fixed Cross.Centralisation. Orientation. Decentralisation. Individual unity. Sensed duality.Universal unity. Fire. Fire. Air. Selfishness. Struggle. Service. Evolution. Thefinal path. Liberation.I could continue to summarise the qualities and characteristics of these threeand their peculiar inter-relation but the above will suffice amply todemonstrate the connection between them and their progressive effect upon thesubject [175] passing under their influence periodically and cyclically. Theyare frequently referred to as the signs which—when studied—will reveal divineintent in man, will mark the points of crisis in his progress and will (when thethree influences which they express have done their work) carry the man “fromdoor to door, for Leo is the next sign to Cancer, and Sagittarius is the signwhich precedes Capricorn.” I am quoting from an ancient book on the signs.Sagittarius is sometimes depicted as an archer on a white horse and a study ofthe meaning of this symbolism will reveal a great deal of inner teaching. Thisis one of the later ways of portraying this constellation. Earlier, in Atlanteandays (from which period we have inherited what we know about astrology), thesign was frequently depicted by the Centaur—the fabulous animal which was half aman and half a horse. The horse symbolism dominated Atlantean myths and symbols,just as the ram and the lamb are prominently to be found in our modernpresentations. This earlier sign of the Centaur stood for the evolution and thedevelopment of the human soul, with its human objectives, its selfishness, itsidentification with form, its desire and its aspirations. The Archer on thewhite horse, which is the more strictly Aryan symbol for this sign, signifiesthe orientation of the man towards a definite goal. The man is then not part ofthe horse but is freed from identification with it and is the controllingfactor. The definite goal of the Centaur, which is the satisfaction of desireand animal incentives, becomes in the later stages the goal of initiation, whichmeets with satisfaction in Capricorn, after the preliminary work has been donein Sagittarius. The keynote of the Centaur is ambition. The keynote of theArcher is aspiration and direction, and both are expressions of human goals butone is of the personality and the other of the soul. [176] From ambition toaspiration, from selfishness to an intense desire for selflessness, fromindividual one-pointed self-interest in Leo to the one-pointedness of thedisciple in Sagittarius and thence to initiation in Capricorn. It is interestingto note that the astrological symbol for this sign currently used is simply thearrow with a fragment of the bow depicted. The Archer as well as the Centaurhave dropped out of the picture and this is largely because the emphasis orfocus of human living today is not based upon the objective outer facts of lifeupon the physical plane but upon some form of inner focus or emphasis, whichvaries from the many stages of astral and emotional ambition to spiritualaspiration, and from the activities of the lower mind bent upon selfish interestto the illumination of the same mind through focus upon the soul. An ancientcatechism which all disciples have to master, asks the following questions andsupplies the needed answers:“Where is the animal, O Lanoo? and where the Man?Fused into one, O Master of my Life. The two are one. But both have disappearedand naught remains but the deep fire of my desire.Where is the horse, the white horse of the soul? Where is the rider of thathorse, O Lanoo?Gone towards the gate, O Master of my Life. But something speeds ahead betweenthe pillars of an open door—something that I myself have loosed.And what remains to thee, O wise Lanoo, now that the horses of two kinds haveleft thee and the rider, unattached, stands free? Now what remains? [177]Naught but my bow and arrow, O Master of my Life, but they suffice, and, whenthe right time comes, I, thy Lanoo, will follow fast upon the shaft I sent. Thehorses I will leave upon this side of the door, for them I have no further need.I enter free, regain the arrow which I sent and speed upon my way, passing fromdoor to door, and each time the arrow speeds ahead.”It is for this reason that the keynotes of Sagittarius are five in number.1. Attached or fused duality—the Centaur.Unattached duality—the Archer.Freedom or one-pointedness—the Bow and Arrow.2. Human ambition leading eventually to spiritual aspiration.3. A clear shaft of light which is the intuitive and focussed attitude of thepledged disciple.4. The “returning arrow of the intuition,” as it is sometimes called. For it isthe shaft of the arrow of aspiration which returns to the sender as the arrow ofthe intuition. Sagittarius is one of the intuitive signs, for only the intuitionwill suffice to carry a man to the foot of the mountain of initiation inCapricorn.5. Idealism which is the power to see the vision and to direct one's coursetowards it. This is the work of Mars, the expression of the sixth ray.A study of the charts of the human family at all the different stages, from thetime of the Mutable Cross experience wherein the personality is built up,constructed, developed and integrated, to the final crucifixion of thepersonality [178] upon the Fixed Cross of the Heavens, will reveal that everytime the man finds himself under the influence of Sagittarius it is with theobjective of orienting himself to some new and higher objective, with the taskof refocussing himself towards a higher goal and with the unfoldment of somebasic and directing purpose. These developing purposes may range all the wayfrom purely animal desire, through selfish human ambition, to the struggle ofthe aspiring disciple or initiate in order to achieve the needed liberationtowards which the entire evolutionary process has impelled him. It isinteresting, in this connection, to trace the unfolding of the humanconsciousness through the influence of the energies let loose through thevarious zodiacal signs:1. Instinct, governing desire—Cancer. Mass unevolved consciousness.I desire.2. Intellect, governing ambition—Leo. Individual consciousness.I know.3. Intuition, governing aspiration—Sagittarius. Soul consciousness in earlystages. Initiation 1 and 2.I vision.4. Illumination, governing intuition—Capricorn. Soul consciousness in laterstages.I realise.5. Inspiration, governing service—Aquarius. Group consciousness.I go forth. [179]6. Identification, governing liberation—Pisces. Divine consciousness.I and the Father are one.In these signs—Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces—youhave the six signs which constitute the six pointed star of the human or fourthCreative Hierarchy; Cancer and Pisces marking the two extremes. The Crabsymbolises imprisonment (the hard shell and the rocks under which the Crab evertakes shelter), and the Fish signifies freedom. In between—in Leo, Sagittarius,Capricorn and Aquarius—come the four stages of personality development, strugglewith the pairs of opposites, and finally release into full spiritual service. Inconnection with the development of the intellect into the intuition and itsconsummation as the divine aspiration of the personality (“inspired from onhigh,” as this stage is technically called), the following ideas may be founduseful; I am simply hinting at them and am leaving the student to work out thevarious implications for himself.We have seen that Cancer is the sign of instinctual life, and that in Leo theintellect or mind became part of the individual man's equipment. Thisintellectual awareness is the result of a slow evolution of the instinctualnature which, when it has reached a certain stage of development, came under thedirect influence of the Hierarchy of the planet in a new way, and then—under thestimulation of energies from the planet Venus—a fusion took place which resultedin the emergence of individual self-conscious man. Gradually, as the aeons haveslipped away, the instinctual nature has receded steadily into the background orbelow the threshold of consciousness, whilst the intellect has become more andmore dominant and an increasingly potent factor. In [180] Scorpio the mind isreleased into full governing activity. This release takes place in two stages:Stage 1—Wherein the intellect becomes dominant and powerful and controlseventually the emotional nature.Stage 2— Wherein the intellect is illumined by the light of the soul.In dealing with probationary disciples and with ordinary humanity, the serversof humanity would do well to remember these two stages and not confuse them asthey attempt to aid those who are in one or other of them. The emphasis is laidupon the struggle of the personality to release itself from the grip of lowerdesire in the first case, and in the second to release itself from surroundingworld glamour which is revealed when soul light is thrown into it, via thereflecting and illumined mind. In stage 1, the power of the trained reasoningand rationalising mind is called into activity by the soul; in the other, theillumination of the soul must pour into the mind and is then reflected, like asearchlight, onto the astral plane.This takes place upon the Probationary Path and is called the experience of thedisciple in the depths or the valleys .In Sagittarius, the intellect which has been developed, used and finallyillumined, becomes sensitive to a still higher type of mental experience and tothis we give the name of intuitive perception. There come flashes of light uponproblems; a distant yet possible vision of attainment is seen; the man begins toclimb out of the depths to which he has descended in Scorpio and sees ahead ofhim the mountain in Capricorn which he knows he must eventually climb. He walksno longer in the dark, for he sees what he has to do and he therefore makesrapid progress and travels “fast [181] upon the Way.” He “flies from point topoint, searching for the arrows which he has discharged.” He has, figurativelyspeaking, to dismount constantly from his white horse (the developed andpurified personality) and find where the arrows of intuitional aspiration willtake him; he travels upon the “wings of the soul” (note the relationship to thewinged feet of Mercury, the messenger of the Gods) and becomes, in his ownpersonality, himself the winged God: Mercury, as you know, governs Gemini, thepolar opposite of Sagittarius. This he does until he has established a balancedrelationship between the personality and the soul and can function as either atany desired moment with equal facility.This takes place upon the Path of Discipleship and is called the experience ofthe disciple upon the plains of Earth, for the path between the pairs ofopposites runs straight and level, leaving the depths of personality experienceand the heights of soul experience (at this point of development) on eitherside.In Capricorn, the initiate learns to realise the meaning of the growing lightwhich greets his progress as he climbs upward to the mountain top. The flashesof intuition with which he is becoming familiar change into the blazing andconstant light of the soul, irradiating the mind and providing that point offusion which must ever be the “fusion of the two lights, the greater and thelesser light” to which I referred in A Treatise on White Magic . The light ofthe personality and the light of the soul blend. Upon this I need not enlarge,as nothing I could say would be more than it now is—the theory of initiation.This takes place upon the Path of Initiation and is called the experience of themountain top . All are needed—the depths, the plains and the mountain top.[182] As you know, Sagittarius is one of the four arms of the Mutable Cross. Anidea of the general symbology of this Cross, from the quality angle, can begained if we give the two sets of characteristics which distinguish the man uponthis Cross—both unevolved man and the aspirant to divinity. We might list theseas follows, finding for each arm a distinctive phrase :Unevolved man Gemini—Changeableness. Instability. Interplay.Sagittarius—Ambitious desire. Direction. Orientation. Virgo—Material life. Thecherishing of an idea. Pisces—Sensation. Mediumship. Fluidity. Evolved manGemini—Recognition of soul and form. Soul interplay. Sagittarius—One-pointedspiritual aspiration. Disciples. Virgo—The mother of the Christ Child.Gestation. Pisces—The world Saviour. Mediatorship.In connection with the above, it is interesting to note that the Twins set apartand unattached in Gemini become the Centaur, the man-beast, in Sagittarius,whilst Virgo, the Virgin, becomes the Fish goddess in the polar opposite,Pisces. A treatise could be written on the subject of the relation of theopposites in the zodiacal circle for they express spirit and matter and theirinter-relation, plus the [183] play of qualitative energies; they bear witnessat the same time to the fact that these two are one and are simply theexpression of great mutable, and yet fixed and initiated spiritual Lives. It isfor this reason that the constellation Libra occupies a unique place in theGreat Wheel, for it is the energy coming from this constellation which controlswhat we might call (for lack of a more suitable word) the “hub of the wheel.”This is that point in intermediate space where the twelve zodiacal energies meetand cross. Libra, therefore, controls the “moment of reversal of the wheel” inthe life of every aspirant, for there comes a moment in the cycle of liveswherein a point of balance is reached and a relative equilibrium is attained,and over this event Libra presides. Some day it will be of interest to make ascientific research and investigation into the power of balance which Librawields and a consequent analysis of the effect of Libra in an individual life.It might then be possible to discover whether the particular life in which a mancarries forward the process of reversal may not perhaps be one in which the sunis in Leo, with Libra rising. Such statistical studies have not yet been made,but there is much to be done along these lines; I only make suggestions, but itwill, I think, be found that this is the case. A proper investigation likewiseinto the life history of spiritualism and of the mediums associated with it mayprove that the majority of the mediums in the world who are of a low grade typeor purely trance mediums—negative and usually unintelligent—are born in Cancerwith Pisces rising, or in Pisces with Cancer rising. Such studies wouldnecessarily have to deal with hundreds of cases and be carried forward over along period of time in order to prove the point which I seek to make. It wouldalso be interesting to make an analysis of those particular incarnations andtheir horoscopes wherein [184] the polar opposites both appear in relation toeach other—one as the sun sign and the other as the ascendant, for these livesusually express some degree of either equilibrium or of consummation; they willnot in any case be negative lives or lacking in direction, event or purpose.This is particularly the case upon the Fixed Cross of the Heavens.You will note that my purpose in this section of our treatise is to evokeinterest and enquiry and to incite students to scientific, statistical andanalytical investigation. Only in this way will my basic premises be proven andeventually substituted for the present unsatisfactory methods—methods which mostastrologers who have any real capacity and insight regard as deplorable andunsatisfactory.The ruler of Sagittarius from the orthodox angle is Jupiter, and from thestandpoint of the path of discipleship it is the Earth itself. Mars governs thissign from the standpoint of the Hierarchies involved. The most interesting factwhich emerges as we study the Mutable Cross as a whole is connected with therulers of all the four signs. From the point of view of orthodox astrology, onlytwo planets rule or govern all the four signs; these are Jupiter and Mercury.Mercury governs Gemini and Virgo, whilst Jupiter governs Sagittarius and Pisces.The reason for this is obvious if you study the nature of the rays which expressthemselves through these signs. Mercury is the agent or the messenger of thefourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict, whilst Jupiter is the medium forexpression of the second Ray of Love-wisdom. These two rays govern the mass ofmen upon the Mutable Cross and are closely concerned with the mass incarnationof the fourth Creative Hierarchy. Their function is to fuse and blend into onecooperative whole the great dualities expressing themselves through the fourthkingdom in nature. The significance of this will be [185] obvious. It is easilyapparent how, through the influences of Mercury and Jupiter, material desire canbe transmuted into divine love, and the conflict which is the distinguishingcharacteristic of the human family can be instrumental in resolving dissonanceinto harmony. The definite pattern and direction of this process has to takeform upon the Mutable Cross before the energies of the Fixed Cross can changethe ambitious selfish man into the selfless disciple. All this has perforce tobe initiated upon the Mutable Cross which is essentially and significantly theCross of the mutable, fluidic, restless mind and it is on this Cross that themind nature is finally developed and begins its integrating control of thepersonality. When this process is proceeding, the Mutable Cross experience isover and the Cross of Discipleship begins to play its part.The case is quite different in connection with the subjective side ofunfoldment, and esoterically the disciple who finds himself in incarnation underthe influence of the Mutable Cross in his personality life whilst he, as a soul,is upon the Fixed Cross, comes under the directed energy of four planets, threeof which are non-sacred planets. Usually these four supersede or rather begin todominate the influence of Mercury and Jupiter, giving greater facility ofexpression and exerting that influence which will bring the personality intoright relation to the soul, for that is essentially the task of the Fixed Crossand the goal of the disciple. It is in connection with the planets governingSagittarius, exoterically and esoterically, that an idea can easily be gained ofthe complexity of the forces with which every disciple has to contend and thesignificance of the ray forces which pour into and through him. Take for examplethe constellation which we are now considering, and remember that the same basicstreams of energy will have to be [186] noted in connection with every othersign in which a man may take incarnation. We find that we shall have toconsider:1. The Sun Sign.—In this case Sagittarius conditions circumstances, indicatinginheritance and forcing the environment to be declarative in connection with thesubject.2. The Rising Sign.—The ascendant can be one of the other eleven signs.3. The Mutable Cross.—The four energies which meet “at the midway point” andhave a united and definite effect upon the subject. The same statement appliesto the other two Crosses.4. The Orthodox Planets.—These condition the personality. In this case we haveMercury and Jupiter. The twelve houses governed by the planets are likewise ofprime importance from the angle of the transmitted energy.5. The Esoteric Planets.—These bring in renewed or increased planetary energyand ray energy in a more dynamic manner. In the case of Sagittarius theseenergies are Venus, the Moon, the Earth and Pluto.6. The Planetary Ruler of a Hierarchy.—In this particular case, this planet isMars, ruling the sixth Creative Hierarchy, the lunar Lords (the elementals ofthe threefold personality) who have to be brought under the control of the solarLord.A study of the above will reveal most interesting relationships and prove mypoint anent the multiplicity of energies to which the wonderful mechanism of mancan respond and [187] to which, as evolution proceeds, he can becomeincreasingly sensitive.I cannot here enter into a detailed analysis of the many energies which pourthrough the disciple as he arrives at the final stages upon the Mutable Cross,and in Sagittarius achieves the determination to “direct his steps into anotherway of life and with ardour firm to mount another Cross,” as the Old Commentaryputs it. I can only point out that the following ray forces pour onto the manthrough the medium of the following planets:Exoteric Mercury–– 4th Ray––– Harmony through Conflict. Jupiter––– 2nd Ray––Love-wisdom. Esoteric Venus–––– 5th Ray––– Concrete Science. Mind. The Moon– 4thRay––– Harmony through Conflict. The Earth– 3rd Ray––– Active Intelligence.Pluto––––– 1st Ray––– Destructive aspect. Hierarchical Mars––––– 6th Ray–––Devotion. War to the death of the personality or form.An analysis of this will show that the “forces of conflict” are powerful in thissign, primarily in the life of the disciple. Harmony through Conflict isceaselessly active and appears in both the orthodox and the esotericassignments. The destructive power of the first ray, focussed in Pluto, bringschange, darkness and death. To this intensity and potency of Pluto must be addedthe forceful and dynamic energy of the planet Mars. This brings the entire humanfamily, as well as the individual, under the law of strife, based this time uponsixth ray devotion to an ideal, high or low. All these play upon the individualborn in the sign of [188] Sagittarius, as well as upon the fourth CreativeHierarchy as a whole. This, you can see for yourself, brings in a terrificsituation, and the forces playing upon the disciple are of a momentousnature—provided that the mechanism of awareness is adequate to respond. Theseforces in all the signs are ever present, but responsiveness and sensitivity totheir impact is dependent upon the nature of the response apparatus. Ponder uponthis thought, for it is this sensitivity which marks the difference between thedisciple and the average man.These planetary influences are distinctive of the Sons of Mind , of Venusianorigin; they are characteristic of the Lords of Sacrifice and Will functioningin time and space as the fourth Creative Hierarchy. The form life is ruled bythe Moon, veiling a hidden planet; these Sons of Mind live on the Earth and thuswithin the body of the planetary Logos, and are of a definitely intelligentnature, making them Lords of Knowledge, achieving their goal through the lightof the mind and through the method of conflict, for they are also Lords ofCeaseless and Persevering Devotion. All the above names which are related to theplanets governing Sagittarius will be remembered by students of The SecretDoctrine . They are the “quality names” of the Divine Manasaputras , theAgnishvattas who are ourselves.A consideration of the above paragraph will indicate to you the importance ofthe sign Sagittarius in the life of the incarnating Sons of God.I would point out also that, through Jupiter and its influences, Sagittarius isrelated to three other great constellations:1. Pisces—Exoterically, indicating the final goal for man.2. Aquarius—Esoterically, indicating the purpose of all [189] material evolutionand the objective of all incarnating processes.3. Virgo—Hierarchically, indicating the purpose of the Cosmic Christ.Both the Earth and Saturn (one a non-sacred and one a sacred planet) areexponents or expressions of the third Ray of Active Intelligence, and this rayrelationship serves to bring the influences of Capricorn into relationship withSagittarius, thus providing a field of energy wherein the one-pointed disciplecan finally become the initiate. This is the set goal of the subject born inSagittarius—whether it is the set goal of initiation into some form of sensuousexperience or of spiritual undertaking and consciousness. The result of allexperience in any sign of the zodiac should definitely work out as an expansionof consciousness and, no matter what form this experience may take, itconsummates in an initiation of some kind or another. Students would do well toregard initiation as a determining process in life, and should endeavour thatevery life experience or cycle of life experiences should work out as aninitiation into a wider field of awareness, of expression and of resultantcontact.There is little more that I need say and little else upon which I need at thisstage of study to comment. The man who is nearing the path of discipleship orwho is already a disciple—pledged or under observation—will profit much from adeep and systematic study of this sign. I would suggest that the student bear inmind the position of this sign. Scorpio stands midway between two signs ofbalance or of equilibrium—Sagittarius and Libra. Libra marks an interlude or anotable point of balance before the strenuous testing and trial of Scorpio.Sagittarius marks another point of balance which follows after that testing, forthe [190] Archer has to acquire and hold a steady eye, hand and stance prior tofiring the arrow which, when rightly directed and correctly followed, will carryhim through the portal of initiation.In studying Sagittarius, it becomes obvious that one of the major underlyingthemes is that of Direction . The Archer is guiding his horse towards some onespecific objective; he is sending or directing his arrow towards a desiredpoint; he is aiming at some specific goal. This sense of direction or guidanceis characteristic of the enlightened man, of the aspirant and disciple, and thisis a growing recognition; when this faculty of sensitive direction is rightlydeveloped it becomes, in the early stages, an effort to identify all soul andpersonality activity with God's Plan, and this is, in the last analysis, theordered direction of God's thought. There is no true direction apart fromthought, and I would have you remember that thought is power . This is astatement upon which all disciples should ponder, for they can achieve no realcomprehension of the direction of God's Plan unless they work with a phase intheir own lives which is subject to their own mental direction. Then and onlythen, can they understand. Upon the ordinary wheel of life, the man who is bornin this sign or with this sign in the ascendant will be influenced by what theancient Hindu Scriptures call kama-manas, which is inadequately translated bythe words, desire-mind. This dual force controls and influences the life; in theearly stages of unfoldment its focus is upon desire and the satisfaction of thatdesire and, in the later stages of purely personality development, the focus isupon the control of desire by the mind; the major objective is, at this time,the intelligent use of all powers to bring about adequate satisfaction ofdesire, which is, in this case, very frequently simply ambition to [191] achievesome goal or attain some objective. This process of personality satisfactiontakes place upon the ordinary wheel. Upon the reversed wheel, the goal is theexpression of love-wisdom and this is ever selflessly developed and alwaysconsecrated to the good of the whole and not to the satisfaction of theindividual.We are told that Sagittarius governs the thighs, which are the main centre ofphysical power and protective strength, and also the sacral centre whichprovides the energy for the use of the creative powers of the physical life.This is also symbolically true. In Sagittarius, the disciple has two things todiscover within himself; these are the power to make progress upon the path andto walk the Way, and also the ability to create in the higher and spiritualsense. This concerns the relationship between the sacral and the throat centres.These powers (the higher powers) are as yet embryonic in the earlier Sagittarianexperience of the disciple, but they become more developed and potent as hecyclically returns to life experience in this sign.It is interesting to note that no planet is exalted in Sagittarius and that noplanet falls in this sign. Only one thing happens and that is that the power ofMercury is greatly lessened. For this reason Sagittarius is esotericallyregarded as a sign of balance and of no extremes; there is no great fall and noexaltation. This fact indicates that the disciple has to walk an even waybetween the pairs of opposites, uninfluenced by either the “power of exaltationor the potency of that which falls.” Neither the valley nor the heights producesany demonstrable effect.Mercury, which is the expression of the fourth ray and also the God of themental processes, has his power definitely lessened in this sign and this fortwo reasons, esoterically speaking:[192] First, the disciple has definitely to cease identifying himself witheither his own human personality and processes or with the human kingdom, priorto taking initiation. His emphasis is, for the future, to be upon the spiritualsoul and the fifth kingdom in nature; in Sagittarius he begins to express thisfirst stage. This involves a complete withdrawal, in the personality sense, fromthe form side of life. This again entails (at a certain point of crisis) a pointof balance.Secondly, the power of the mind, having been developed, tested and found true inthe sign Scorpio, begins to wane in its activity and the intuition begins totake its place. This is essential before the sign Capricorn is entered by thedisciple and preparation for initiation begins.As regards the three decanates of Sagittarius, Sepharial gives us the threegoverning planets as Mercury, the Moon and the Sun, whilst Alan Leo gives usJupiter, Mars and the Sun, emphasising as he always does the way of theesotericists. He usually tunes in on the esoteric significances but not always.Jupiter gives expansion, superseding Mercury, for the mercurial mind is ever alimitation even if only a temporary one. The Moon gives place to Mars, whichconfers the quality of devotion and the capacity to fight for an ideal. Thisidealistic concept and method of work is always the characteristic ofdiscipleship during the early stages of unfoldment upon the Path. The Sun,typifying the solar Angel remains constant both through the exoteric and theesoteric processes and therefore astrology recognises it as a constant pressureand presence. This fact in itself indicates a significant truth. The soulremains eternally present—in the past, in the present and on into the future.In closing, I will simply quote to you the two keywords [193] of this sign, bothas it proceeds upon the ordinary wheel and upon the reversed wheel. Theirmeaning and significance are so obvious that there is no need for elucidation.The injunction to the man upon the orthodox wheel is as follows:And the Word said: “Let food be sought.”To the man upon the reversed wheel the Word goes forth:“I see the goal. I reach that goal and then I see another.” May the words ofthis final injunction to the disciple carry meaning to the heart and mind.SCORPIO, THE SCORPIONWe come now to the consideration of a sign which is of paramount importance inthe life of evolving man. Certain of the signs are in very closerelation—through the inflow and the outflow of energy—with certain of the majorconstellations. These major constellations are, in a few instances, peculiarlyconnected with the signs of the zodiac. There are four of the zodiacal signswhich are mysteriously concerned with what one might call the “personalityexpression” (if such an unsuitable term can be used in default of better) of thesolar Logos Himself, or with the Divine Quaternary, the fourfold manifestationof Deity.These four signs are Aries—Leo—Scorpio—Aquarius, and they involve the expressionof the energy of one Cardinal sign and of three signs which form part of theFixed Cross of the heavens. We could express this truth in another manner: Godthe Father, the Will to manifest, initiates the creative process which is workedout through the activity of God the Son, the cosmic Christ, crucified upon theFixed Cross in the heavens. The activity of God [194] the Holy Spirit, implicitin the Mutable Cross, is closely allied to the previous solar system, and theenergy of that divine aspect is practically entirely occupied with manipulatingthe forces inherited from that system and inherent in the very nature ofsubstance itself. This divine aspect is to the whole general divinemanifestation what the lower nature (form life or personality in the threeworlds of human evolution) is to the soul where an individual human being isconcerned. As regards these three Persons of the divine Trinity, we might saythat:1. Aries is the focal point of the expression of the first aspect of divinity,the will aspect.2. Leo is the focal point for the expression of the second aspect, thelove-wisdom or consciousness aspect. This, primarily where humanity isconcerned.3. Virgo is the focal point for the expression of the third aspect, that ofactive intelligence. In that sign the highest function of matter is symbolised.The four signs—Aries, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius—are related to the followingstars which are not numbered in the twelve signs of the zodiac; they constituteanother field of relationships:Aries to one of the two stars, found in the constellation, the Great Bear, whichare called the two Pointers.Leo to Polaris, the Pole Star, found in the Little Bear.Scorpio to Sirius, the Dog Star.Aquarius to Alcyone, one of the seven Pleiades.There is little that I can tell you in connection with the energies pouring intothe four zodiacal signs from these distant though potent points of outgoingenergy; they are part of the life expression of an Identity, immeasurablysuperior [195] to and more advanced than our solar Logos. A few hints may,however, be of service to the truly esoteric astrologer who may study thesepages, particularly where Scorpio is concerned. Scorpio, at this particularstage of human evolution, governs the Path of Discipleship. You will note herealso how Leo-Scorpio-Aquarius form a peculiar triangle of force, but of this Iwill later deal in Chapter III under the heading, The Science of Triangles.Aries is, as might be expected, closely connected with the Great Bear butpeculiarly so with one of the stars called The Pointers; these point to the Polestar which is at this time a major “star of direction.” Direction, will, purposeand plan are all connected with the solar Logos and with His evolutionaryundertakings in connection with the many lives manifesting in the vehicle ofexpression which we call the solar system. All these respond to the influencesof the first ray which is, to all intents and purposes, the energy of divineembodied will, which has been esoterically described as “unavoidable directedpurpose.” Within our solar system, Vulcan and Pluto are expressions orcustodians of this first ray energy and are, as I have told you, esotericplanets. The first indication of the true spiritual will only begins to manifestupon the Path of Discipleship—hence the late discovery of these two planets(late in point of time and from the angle of human knowledge) for it is only inthis Aryan race period that humanity is to any large extent beginning tomanifest evidence (and as yet it is no more) of a reaction or a response to thespiritual will of deity as it comes to our planet and hence to us via Aries,Vulcan and Pluto. You have, therefore, the following direct line of will energy:1. The Pointer furthest from the Pole Star in the constellation of the GreatBear. This is, esoterically speaking, [196] a great reservoir or focal point fordivine energy, carrying out God's purpose. The Pointer nearest to the Pole Staris expressive of a lower aspect of the will, which—in speaking of humanity—wecall self-will.2. Aries , in which the will to create or to manifest makes its appearance andthe great divine experiment is initiated.3. Vulcan and Pluto are related to the two Pointers and are only now beginning,in any definite and clear manner, to affect human response. Their effect hasbeen planetary in its nature up to date and has not hitherto been at alleffective in either the fourth or the second kingdoms in nature.4. Shamballa , the Custodian of the Plan for our planet.Leo is the sign wherein the consciousness of individuality is developed,utilised and finally consecrated to divine purpose. It is related to Polaris,the Pole Star (found in the Little Bear) and it is also peculiarly susceptibleto the influence of that Pointer in the Great Bear which is the nearest to thePole Star. Esoterically speaking, the Pole Star is regarded as the “star ofre-orientation” whereby the art of “refacing and recovering that which is lost”is developed. This eventually brings a man back to his originating source. Itmight, therefore, be correctly inferred that this Pointer and the energyemanating from it guides humanity upon the involutionary path, and is constantlyactive in its influence upon the man who is still upon the Mutable Cross. Thenthe energy of the Pointer furthest from the Pole Star begins to make itspresence felt and a sense of right direction or guidance is registered by thedisciple upon the Path, and such guidance (when followed) leads man nearer tothe Hierarchy. It is here that the divine [197] necessity of achieving alignmentis portrayed for us in the symbolism of the sky and when it has been achievedthen there is a direct inflow of divine energy and man is linked up in a new andcreative manner to sources of divine supply. Astrologers will do well (inconnection with the horoscopes of disciples and particularly of initiates) toconsider the two Pointers and the Pole Star. They are mysteriously connectedwith the three aspects of incarnated man—Spirit, soul and body. More than thisit is not permitted to me to convey to you. I may, however, give you anotherhint. These three stars are embodiments of the three aspects of divine will. Itis the three aspects of all expressions of divinity in manifestation whichunderlie the Science of Triangles . This I will later elaborate.Another triangle of energy also appears: Aries, Leo and Polaris, and they aredoubly connected through the medium of the Pointers.Scorpio is under the influence or inflowing energy of Sirius. This is the greatstar of initiation because our Hierarchy (an expression of the second aspect ofdivinity) is under the supervision or spiritual magnetic control of theHierarchy of Sirius. These are the major controlling influences whereby thecosmic Christ works upon the Christ principle in the solar system, in theplanet, in man and in the lower forms of life expression. It is esotericallycalled the “brilliant star of sensitivity.” You have therefore:Polaris—The Star of Direction—governing Shamballa. Later, another Pole Star willtake the place of Polaris, owing to the interplay of forces in the universe andthe general shift and movement. But the name and quality of this star will onlybe revealed at initiation. [198]Sirius—The Star of Sensitivity—governing the Hierarchy.Alcyone—The Star of the Individual—governing humanity.You can see from the above how the entire plan of this Treatise is graduallyunfolding. It was necessary for me to indicate to you the nature and the purposeof the three divine centres—Shamballa, the Hierarchy, and Humanity—before Icould make this part of the teaching clear to you, or before I could point outthe nature of the energies pouring from distant constellations and zodiacalsigns into our planetary scheme.Scorpio is the great constellation which influences the turning point both inthe life of humanity and the life of the individual human being. For the firsttime in the history of both mankind and disciples the energy of Sirius, pouringinto the seven groups which form our planetary Hierarchy evokes a response. Iwould remind you of a basic fact in the evolutionary process which astrologywill eventually prove scientifically and past all controversy. This is the factthat energies and forces are pouring upon our system and our planetary livesceaselessly, potently and cyclically. Yet they are only regarded today asexisting when definite response is evoked. They come from all kinds of sources,extraneous to our system and planetary schemes, but until man responds andregisters them both scientists and astrologers fail to recognise them and theyare as if they were not. This is a point to bear in mind as I continue to teachyou, for I may indicate some sources of active energy which may as yet beunknown to you as playing upon our system and its contents. The difficulty willnot be because of my inaccuracies but will be owing to the lack of sensitivityin the mechanism of response which mankind and disciples are at presentutilising.[199] You have consequently in connection with the path of discipleship thefollowing lines of “influential energy”:1. Sirius—working in a sevenfold manner through the seven rays and their sevengroups as these constitute the active Hierarchy.2. The Fixed Cross—a fusion of four major energies, pouring into our solarsystem, on to our planet and through humanity.3. Scorpio—an aspect of the Fixed Cross, of peculiar and specialised potencyupon the Path of Discipleship and preparing, with its tests and trials:a. The process of re-orientation, whereby a man mounts the Fixed Cross andleaves the Mutable Cross.b. The disciple for the first, second and third initiations. After the thirdinitiation, its peculiar testing potency is no longer felt.4. The Hierarchy.—The distributing agency to the various kingdoms in nature.5. Mars and Saturn.—Both these planets are exceedingly potent in connection withinitiation into the life of the Hierarchy; Mars is potent in relation to Scorpioand Saturn in relation to Capricorn. This involves the intensified activity ofthe 6th and the 3rd rays and their energies, and when these are rightly employedthere comes liberation from form control and the release of the consciousindividual.Again, astrologers would do well to work with this line of fused forces,studying its implications and effects in the life of the disciple.[200] Aquarius relates humanity to the Pleiades and therefore to Taurus in anunusual manner. The key to this relation is to be found in the word desire ,leading, through the transmutative processes of life experience, to aspirationand finally the relinquishing of desire in Scorpio. Aquarius, Alcyone andHumanity constitute a most interesting triangle of force. Alcyone is one of theseven Pleiades and is called the “star of the Individual” and sometimes the“star of intelligence.” It was potently active during the previous solar systemwherein the Third Person of the Trinity was peculiarly omnipotent and active,just as today the cosmic Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, is peculiarlyactive in this solar system. The energies coming from Alcyone impregnated thesubstance of the universe with the quality of mind. As a consequence of thismost ancient activity, the same force was present at the time ofindividualisation in this solar system, for it is in this system, and primarilyupon our planet, the Earth, that the major results of that early activity havemade themselves felt. Two of our planets, the Earth (non-sacred) and Uranus(sacred), are directly the product of this third ray activity. This is of greatimportance to remember. I would also ask you to link this thought with theteaching that through the divine centre of intelligent activity which we callhumanity, the fourth kingdom in nature will eventually act as the mediatingprinciple to all the three lower kingdoms. Humanity is the divine Messenger tothe world of form; it is essentially Mercury, bringing light and life to otherdivine manifestations and of this all divine world Saviours are the eternalsymbols.This coming process of planetary service through the third divine centre is onlytruly effective when Aquarius rules and when our sun is passing through thatsign of the [201] zodiac. Hence the immense importance of the next 2000 years.Therefore, only when a man is a world server and becoming group conscious canthis desired objective of manifestation begin to demonstrate. It is beginning tohappen today for the first time in planetary history. It is one of the firstfruits of initiation and only in the next root race to our present Aryan racewill we begin really to understand the significance of the process and the truenature of the energies to be released through the medium of humanity upon theplanet. It is for this reason that Jupiter and Uranus (expressions of the secondand the seventh rays) are the exoteric and esoteric rulers of Aquarius.You have, therefore, the following line of force to study:1. Alcyone—in the Pleiades, the mothers of the seven aspects of form life andthe “wives of the seven Rishis of the Great Bear.” They are connected with theMother aspect which nurtures the infant Christ.2. Aquarius—the World Server, the transmitter of energy which evokes magneticresponse.3. Jupiter and Uranus—planets of beneficent consummation. The second ray of loveand the seventh ray which fuses spirit and matter “to the ultimate glory” of thesolar Logos are in the fullest eventual cooperation.4. Humanity—the focal point for all these energies and the divine distributor ofthem to individual man and later to the lower three kingdoms in nature.Thus you see, that from a generalisation re the exterior constellations(exterior to the zodiac and the solar system itself) we are becoming morespecific, showing how certain stars in these constellations are definitelyrelated by direct [202] lines of energy to our planet; these lines of forceusually reach us via one of the zodiacal signs and—in rare cases— directly to aplanet. The latter case is, however, exceedingly rare. We have also brought intorelation to our solar system another constellation, called the Little Bear whichis a reflection of or a corollary to the major energies of its greaterprototype, Ursa Major, the Great Bear. These facts contain a great mysteryconnected with the inter-relation of Ursa Major, Ursa Minor and the Pleiades;they constitute one of the greatest and more important of the triplicities to befound in the heavens as far as we have astronomically ascertained the nature ofour immediate universe. This is a perfectly unimportant piece of information asfar as you are concerned and is only of significance to initiates of the fourthdegree. It serves, nevertheless, to add its evidence to the essential integrityand interlocking dependencies of the universe.In order the better to understand the nature of discipleship and the processesof stabilisation and right direction, we must precede the Capricornianexperience of initiation with a careful study of the spiritual implications ofthe sign Scorpio and of its function in providing “points of crisis” and“moments of reorientation,” as this will be of the utmost value to the earneststudent. Even though I am endeavouring to lay the foundation for the newastrology and to provide some measure of technical information from the point ofview of the Hierarchy, my underlying motive is ever the same: to indicate theway of living process and to stimulate that divine curiosity and that sense ofoutgoing spiritual adventure and eager aspiration for progress which is latentin all disciples and which, when stimulated, will enable them to proceed moreserenely and sanely upon the [203] Path of Return. Otherwise the practical valueof that which I seek to impart is of no real importance at all; I shall beunderstood and the new astrology will come into being according to the esotericcapacity of those who read and ponder my words. I am exceedingly anxious that inthese days wherein the influence of Scorpio and of the planet Mars is sostrongly felt in world affairs that true insight may be cultivated, optimism andunderstanding developed and the nature of the tests to which the world disciple,humanity, is today being subjected may be estimated at their true value and thuslight be shed upon the way of man. Only through understanding will solution comeand rectification of error be achieved.The tests of Scorpio are necessarily three in nature as they concern intimatelythe readiness of the threefold personality:1. To reorient itself to the life of the soul and later2. To evidence readiness for initiation.3. To demonstrate sensitivity to the Plan thus becoming the one-pointed disciplein Sagittarius.The three major tests are again divided into three stages, and upon the Path ofDiscipleship the man may find himself passing into this sign for testing andexperience nine times. The fact of the three tests each existing in their threestages may convey a hint to esoteric astrologers as to the purpose of the threedecanates into which each sign is divided—a point upon which I shall hope totouch when we come to our study of the Science of Triangles. Each test (andtherefore each decanate) concerns the three aspects which in this Treatise onthe Seven Rays we have called: life, quality and appearance. Thus the threegreat [204] tests in Scorpio are in reality nine tests and hence the nine-headedHydra or Serpent which is ever associated with Scorpio and hence also the natureof the stupendous victory achieved by Hercules, the Sun-God, in this sign.It is interesting to note that each of the great Sons of God Whose names arepre-eminent in the minds of men—Hercules, the Buddha and the Christ—areassociated in the archives of the Great White Lodge with three special signs ofthe zodiac (which in a peculiar manner constitute the “zodiacal decanate”) ineach of which They passed from test to victory.In Scorpio—Hercules became the triumphant disciple.In Taurus—The Buddha achieved victory over desire and arrived at illumination.In Pisces—The Christ overcame death and became the world saviour.These three constellations, therefore, form a triangle of initiation of profoundimportance because it provides those conditions and that energy which will testand perfect the three aspects of the personality so that they are truereflections of the three divine aspects; they concern soul and body primarilyand therefore their expression is through the Mutable Cross and the Fixed Crossbut not the Cardinal Cross. We might add to the above the following:1. Scorpio carries the test right down into the physical plane life, and then,when it is faced and handled there, the life of the man is carried up intoheaven, and the problem which the test involved is solved by the use of thereasoning mind.2. Taurus governs desire and carries the test into the emotional [205] or astralplane, and carries desire-sensitivity up from the form side of life into thatworld of sensitive perception which we call the intuitional plane.3. Pisces carries the test into the region of the mental processes, which is thereflection of the will aspect of divinity; the problem of the initiate in thissign is voiced by Christ in the words, “Father, not my will but Thine be done.”The tests carry the self-will of the personality up into the region of thedivine will and the result is inspiration and the emergence of a world saviour.Ponder upon the above and learn the lessons of appetite, of desire and ofself-will for they are many and useful.The three tests in Scorpio also concern the three aspects of the human being asthey fuse and blend upon the physical plane. They are, first of all, the test ofappetite. This appetite is the natural predilections and tendencies which areinherent in the animal nature and these are mainly three: Sex, physical comfort,and money, as concretised energy. They are, secondly, the tests connected withdesire and the astral plane. These are subtler in nature, producing automaticeffects upon the physical plane; they are not inherent in the animal nature butare imposed by the desire nature and are again three in number: Fear, hatred andambition or desire for power. Then there are, thirdly, the tests of the lowercritical mind which are: Pride, separativeness and cruelty. Remember that theworst kind of cruelty is not of a physical nature but is more mental incharacter. Therefore, you have in the category of that which must be tested andproved to be non-existent the following categories, which I am re-enumeratingbecause of their basic importance: [206](1) 1. Sex—the relation of the pairs of opposites. These can be selfishlyutilised or divinely blended. 2. Physical comfort—life conditions, selfishlyappropriated. 3. Money—selfishly cornered (if I may use such a phrase). (2) 1.Fear—which conditions activity today. 2. Hate—which is a factor in conditioningrelationships. 3. Ambition—conditioning objectives. (3) 1. Pride—which isintellectual satisfaction, making the mind the barrier to soul control. 2.Separativeness—which is the isolated attitude and which makes the mind thebarrier to right group relations. 3. Cruelty—which is satisfaction withpersonality methods and which makes the mind the instrument of the sense ofpower.When these faults are realised and are overcome, the result is twofold: theestablishing of right relations with the soul and also with the environment.These two results are the goal of all tests in Scorpio.The keynotes of this sign are, therefore, test, trial and triumph. They can alsobe called struggle, strength and Sagittarian attitudes. Another angle of theexperience in Scorpio can be covered by two words: re-capitulation andre-orientation. In Scorpio, two most occult factors emerge from the past andbegin to engross the attention of the disciple. One is memory and the other is,as a consequence of the memory, the Dweller on the Threshold. Memory in thesense here involved is not simply just [207] a faculty of the mind, as is so oftsupposed, but it is essentially a creative power. It is basically an aspect ofthought and—coupled with imagination—is a creative agent because thoughts arethings, as well you know. From ancient recesses of the memory, from a deeplyrooted past which is definitely recalled, and from the racial and the individualsubconscious (or founded and established thought reservoirs and desires,inherited and inherent) there emerges from individual past lives and experiencethat which is the sum total of all instinctual tendencies, of all inheritedglamours and of all phases of wrong mental attitudes; to these (as theyconstitute a blended whole) we give the name of the Dweller on the Threshold.This Dweller is the sum total of all the personality characteristics which haveremained unconquered and unsubdued and which must be finally overcome beforeinitiation can be taken. Each life sees some progress made; some personalitydefects straightened out and some real advance effected. But the unconqueredresidue and the ancient liabilities are numerous and excessively potent and—whensoul contact is adequately established—there eventuates a life wherein thehighly developed and powerful personality becomes, in itself, the Dweller on theThreshold. Then the Angel of the Presence and the Dweller stand face to face andsomething must then be done. Eventually, the light of the personal self fadesout and wanes in the blaze of glory which emanates from the Angel. Then thegreater glory obliterates the lesser. This is, however, only possible when thepersonality eagerly enters into this relation with the Angel, recognises itselfas the Dweller and—as a disciple—begins the battle between the pairs ofopposites and enters into the tests of Scorpio. These tests and trials are everself-initiated; the disciple puts himself into the positive or conditioningenvironment [208] wherein the trials and the discipline are unavoidable andinevitable. When the mind has reached a relatively high stage of development,the memory aspect is evoked in a new and conscious manner and then every latentpre-disposition, every racial and national instinct, every unconquered situationand every controlling fault rises to the surface of consciousness and then—thefight is on. The keynote of Scorpio is, however, Triumph . This is its majorexpression upon the physical plane. As a result of struggle and of victory, thewhole divine man—not yet perfectly expressing himself, if I might word thesituation thus—is anchored upon the physical plane with such accuracy andclarity that there is no escape from the environing conclusions of thedisciple's family, friends and group that he is a disciple. From that angle heis meticulously watched; he learns the meaning of the word “example”; he ispilloried by those who are onlookers and the first conscious stages toward groupawareness and group response, plus group service, are now taken. Such is theoutcome and the reward of the experience in Scorpio.It is in this sign that the prodigal son comes to himself, and having eaten ofthe husks of life and having exhausted the resources of worldly desire andambition—he says: “I will arise and go to my Father.” There are two such majorcrises in the life of the aspirant:1. When the intelligent man of the world comes to himself and then re-orientshimself to the soul and its requirements. This leads to the tests in Scorpio.2. When the initiate of the third degree—upon a higher turn of thespiral—re-orients himself to the Monad and passes through most subtle tests tocertain undefinable [209] and spiritual recognitions. Upon these we need notenlarge.There is little for me to add here in connection with the fact that Scorpio isupon one of the four arms of the Fixed Cross. In the study of previous signs,much anent the Fixed Cross has already been covered and there is no need for meto repeat the information here. Desire in Taurus becomes spiritual aspiration inScorpio. The darkness of the experience in Scorpio becomes illumination inTaurus, for it must never be forgotten that where the pairs of opposites areconcerned they gain and profit from each other, for there is a direct line offorce and of contact between the two. This is a fact which is seldom recognised.We come now to a consideration of the Rulers which govern the sign, Scorpio.Their influence is potent in the lives of the average or undeveloped man whoresponds more easily to the planetary influences in the twelve houses of hispersonality horoscope than does the more advanced man who is coming under thedirect influence of the zodiacal signs. Through these Rulers, two rays arebrought into a potent controlling position in Scorpio; they are the sixth Ray ofDevotion and the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict, the latter having apeculiar relation to the mode of human development and the former to the methodsof the Piscean age which is just passing. Mars and Mercury control and Mars isparticularly active, owing to the fact that Mars is both the orthodox planetcontrolling the personality in Scorpio and also the esoteric planet conditioningthe unfoldment of the disciple. Mars is the dominating factor in the tests andtrials of the disciple, prior to the experience in Sagittarius and theinitiation in Capricorn, and this for the following reasons:[210] First, Mars is definitely the planet which rules and controls the physicalvehicle. Mars appears first of all as the orthodox ruler in Aries, the sign inwhich the first move is made towards bringing about objective manifestation, orphysical incarnation. In Scorpio, the result of all the struggles carriedforward during the seemingly endless pilgrimage around the zodiac or wheel oflife is brought to a point of climax, again through the activity of Mars whichhas not appeared actively in the intervening signs between Aries and Scorpio asfar as the reversed wheel is concerned. The disciple has now to demonstrate thestrength, character and quality which he has unfolded and developed withinhimself during his long pilgrimage. He started in Aries with Mars ruling, andthe great war between the dualities which constitute the man began. The pairs ofopposites were thus brought into relation with each other. In Scorpio, with thesame planet ruling his interior life, the war is on and in this case Mars rulesnot only the physical body but the entire form vehicle, which we call thepersonality in the three worlds. All aspects of the lower nature are involved inthis crisis, for Mars is the esoteric ruler in Scorpio and the tests appliedinvolve the form nature—gross and subtle, integrated and potent. Mars,therefore, rules Aries from the orthodox angle and Scorpio esoterically, anddoes not again appear in the life of the individual except as that individualresponds to mass vibration in Sagittarius, where Mars appears as ruling thesixth Creative Hierarchy, the lunar lords of the form nature who must eventuallybe sacrificed to the higher spiritual aspect and brought under the control ofthe solar Angel. The effect of Mars is, therefore, largely mass effect and groupresults, producing great struggles but leading finally to great revelation. InAries, it is the final revelation of the nature of knowledge and the purpose of[211] incarnation; in Scorpio, it is the revelation of the vision of liberationand service; in Sagittarius, it is the revelation of the purpose of soul controlover the lower kingdoms in nature, via the human centre of energy. It mustconsequently never be forgotten that Mars establishes relations between theopposites and is a beneficent and not a malefic factor, as is so often supposed.When we come to study the Hierarchies and their relation to the signs, certainpoints which are at present obscure will be clarified. This we shall do whendealing with our final point in this section upon astrology and the rays. Weshall then find that Scorpio rules and governs the fourth Creative Hierarchy,the human from the angle of the soul and not from the angle of the lower nature.The final struggle in Scorpio only takes place when the point of balance betweensoul and body has been reached in Libra and it is in Scorpio that thepreponderance of the spiritual energy is imposed upon the lower personal forces.Scorpio governs “the initiates,” which is the true esoteric name of man, andthrough its hierarchical planetary ruler, the Sons of Mind, the Messengers ofDeity are revealed, but it is through Mars and the Martian activity that therevelation comes about.Secondly, Mars is closely related to sex, which is an aspect of the pairs ofopposites, and its effect is also definitely to vitalise the blood stream; itvitalises, purifies and stimulates all aspects and organisms in the body, viathe blood stream. It will be obvious to you, therefore, how the tests in Scorpioand the activity of Mars are potent to arouse the entire lower nature and bringabout its final rebellion and the last stand, so to speak, of the personalityagainst the soul. It is Mars who brings the world Arjuna into the active fight.The whole man is then engaged and the “quarrel of the sexes” is resolved in itshighest aspect [212] through the battle between the highly developed personalityor form nature and the soul which seeks to be the ultimate controlling factor.The colour assigned to Mars is, as you know, red and this is a correspondence tothe colour of the blood stream and hence also the association of Mars withpassion, with anger and a sense of general opposition. The sense of duality isexceedingly powerful. Hence also the necessity for the entire life of man (forthe blood is the life in this sense) to be swung into the conflict, leaving noside of human nature uninvolved; hence again the need for the disciple to carryhis physical nature, his emotional or desire nature and his mental processes upinto heaven. This takes place as a consequence of overcoming the “serpent ofevil” (the form nature with its promptings and demands) by the means of the“serpent of wisdom,” which is the esoteric name oft given to the soul.In connection with the symbolic connection between Mars and the blood, producingthe resultant conflict between life and death (for Scorpio is one of the signsof death), it is interesting to note that Christianity is governed by Mars. Oneis apt to recognise with ease that the sixth ray, working through Mars, rulesChristianity. It is a religion of devotion, fanaticism, of high courage, ofidealism, of the spiritual emphasis upon the individual and his worth andproblem, of conflict and of death. All those characteristics are familiar to usin the presentation of Christian theology. It is however pre-eminently areligion which has waged a cruel and oft illogical war upon sex and itsimplications; it has emphasised a militant celibacy (militant where women andtheir rights and natures are concerned); it has regarded the sex relation as oneof the primary evils in the world and has laid the emphasis upon [213] theinviolable nature of the marriage bond when endorsed by the Church. This has allbeen the result of the beneficent or the malefic effect of the impact of sixthray force upon the form nature. Little emphasis has been laid nevertheless uponthe influence of Mars upon Christianity, making it a definitely militantreligion, oft cruel and sadistic (as witness the murders and tortures carriedout in the name of Christ, who was the outstanding Representative of God'slove). Throughout the teaching of Christian theology, the theme of blood runsceaselessly and the source of salvation is laid upon the blood relationship andnot upon the life aspect which the blood veils and symbolises. It is the creedof a crucified and dead Christ which rules Christianity and not that of therisen Master. One of the reasons for this travesty of the truth has been thatSt. Paul, that great initiate, prior to taking the third initiation which he didat the time he was functioning as related in The Acts of the Apostles , waspotently under Martian influence and was born in Scorpio; a study of hishoroscope would demonstrate this were you in a position to study as can we whoare connected with the Hierarchy. It was he who gave the Scorpio-Mars slant tothe interpretation and exposition of the Christian teaching and deflected itsenergy into channels of teaching which its Founder had never intended. Such isoften the undesirable effect of the activities of well-meaning disciples uponthe work which they undertake to carry on after the originator of some work forthe Hierarchy passes over to the other side through death or relinquishes histask in order to take up other duties.The blood theme and the death theme, the suffering and the dire testing of thedisciple, the value of the individual conflict and the consciousness of themisery of existence are basically due to the combined influences of Scorpio andof [214] Mars which have ruled Christianity for so long and which are only nowbeginning somewhat to lose their influence.A study of the processes of death as the sign Scorpio conditions them and theprocesses of death as we see them working out in the sign Pisces would be ofvery real value. Death through the influences of Pluto and death through theinfluences of Mars are widely different. Death in Pisces through the energy ofPluto is transformation—a transformation so vital and so basic that the“... Ancient One is no longer seen. He sinks to the depth of the ocean of life;he descends into hell, but the gates of hell hold him not. He, the new andliving One leaves below that which has held him down throughout the ages andrises from the depths unto the heights, close to the throne of God.”The connection of these words with Christ, the present world Saviour, is obviousin their implications, and yet they were written in our archives over seventhousand years ago. Death in Scorpio is of a different nature and is alsodescribed in the same ancient writing in the following words:“... Ancient One dies by drowning. Such is the test. The waters envelop him andthere is no escape. He drowns. The fires of passion are then quenched. The lifeof desire ceases its appeal and to the bottom of the lake he now descends.Later, he re-ascends to Earth where the white horse waits his coming. And thishe mounts, proceeding towards the second death” (that is, towards Pisces).The reference here to Sagittarius is clear. The disciple—after the death of thepersonality and after the killing out [215] of desire—goes on towards Pisceswhere again he dies “unto an eternal resurrection.” In Scorpio there is thedeath of the personality, with its longings, desires, ambitions and pride. InPisces there is the death of all attachments and the liberation of the soul forservice upon an universal scale. Christ, in Pisces, exemplified the substitutionof love for attachment. Christianity exemplifies the death of the personality,with individual and not universal implications; love has been conspicuouslylacking and the controlling colour of Christianity has indeed been red. It isnot Christ's expression but the Scorpio-Mars presentation of St. Paul. Mars hasruled Christianity because St. Paul misinterpreted the esoteric significances ofthe New Testament message and he misinterpreted because the truth—like alltruths as they reach humanity—had to pass through the filter of his personalitymind and brain; it was then unavoidably given a personal slant and twist andthis is responsible for the sorry historical story of Christianity and the direplight of the nations today—ostensibly Christian nations yet swept by hate,ruled by fear and at the same time by idealism, governed by a fanaticaladherence to their national destiny as they interpret it and “out for blood” asthe piling up of armaments discloses. All these are sixth ray characteristics,emphasised by Scorpio and conditioned by Mars which ever rules the path of theindividual disciple, and today the world disciple, humanity as a whole, standsat the very portal of the Path. The entire west is at this time under Martianinfluence but this will end during the next five years.Thirdly, Mars governs the senses which are five in number. These senses are thebasis of all human knowledge where that which is tangible and objective isconcerned or inferred. Mars, therefore, rules science and hence the reason inthis present era for the fundamental but not permanent [216] materiality ofscience—a materiality which is rapidly lessening as Mars nears the end of itspresent cycle of influence. Already, the trend of modern science is shiftinginto the realm of the intangible and into the world of the non-material. Hencealso the fact that the opposition to occultism is waning and its day of powerapproaching. These subtler senses will supersede the physical senses over whichMars has so long had a successful control, and hence again the growth in theworld today of the psychic senses and the appearance on every hand of thesubtler and more esoteric powers of clair-voyance and clair-audience. Thisdevelopment is inevitable as the influence of Scorpio and of Mars begins tolessen, as is the case today. The year 1945 saw this influence almost completelyvanish, particularly from the astral plane. Astrologers would do well toremember that the influence of the constellations, signs and planets, work outupon three levels of awareness—three descending levels—and are felt first of allupon the mental plane, then upon the astral plane and finally upon the physicalplane. But it is with this last plane that astrologers are primarily concerned,emphasising happenings and events and not their conditioning causes. At present,astrology deals with effects and not with that which is causing them. There ismuch confusion over this matter and the horoscopes of the three levels are oftenmuch distorted. A horoscope which could be interpreted purely upon the mentalplane is given a physical interpretation, and thus happenings which are entirelymental are portrayed as physical occurrences. A clue to this tripleinterpretation which astrology must eventually recognise can be found in therelation of the orthodox, the esoteric and the hierarchical planets and the raysof which they are the expression.You will see from this how important are the functions [217] of Scorpio and Marsupon our planet at this time, and you will note also how brief a time remains inwhich humanity can (rightly or wrongly) handle its tests. You will realise alsothe pressure under which the Hierarchy at this time struggles now that Martianenergy is expressing itself upon the astral plane. Will the world Hercules liftthis problem up into heaven and “elevate the Hydra” of passion and hate, ofgreed and aggression, and of selfishness and ambition up into the region of thesoul? Or will it carry the whole matter down on to the physical plane with theinevitable corollary of world disaster, world war and death? Such are theproblems with which the guiding Hierarchy is faced.Scorpio is also most interestingly connected with the constellation, Cancer,through the influences of the sixth ray, for it should be remembered that thatray is also expressing itself through Neptune, but in a spiritual and esotericmanner. Neptune governs Cancer esoterically. The significance is thereforeclear, for Cancer is the sign of birth; it is the door into incarnation and thesign of generation. Scorpio is the sign of sex and of regeneration, and birth isever the intended result of the sex relation. Father-spirit and Mother-matterwhen brought together produce the Son. The tests and difficulties and pains ofthis era are symptoms or indications of the “entering into manifestation” of thenew civilisation and culture. They portend the birth of the new era for whichthe entire world waits. This will happen if—speaking esoterically—the sixth rayenergy of Mars is transmuted into the sixth ray energy of Neptune, for the oneis “objective and full of blood” and the other is “subjective and full of life.”A great mystery is veiled and hidden in the above relationship, forCancer-Neptune is expressive of the seventh [218] ray which rules and controlsthe eighth Creative Hierarchy. This is one of the five Hierarchies whose namesare unknown to us and this particular one stands upon the verge of liberation.At the same time it is closely connected with the mind principle as it works outthrough the solar Angels or through the human hierarchy. It is related to thebirth of the fourth Creative Hierarchy in a sense not to be understood by anyonebelow the stage of the fourth initiation, but it is an interesting fact toremember for it is in the connection between the sixth and seventh rays thatthat potent “desire for incarnation” was aroused which resulted in the fall ofthe angels in primordial times. This sixth ray influence coming from threeangles—orthodox, esoteric and hierarchical—and hence involving both Neptune andMars—predisposes the race and individual man as well to become one-pointeddisciples in Sagittarius. This latter constellation is ruled by Mars, bringingthe man into control or closer touch with the lunar lords, the sixth CreativeHierarchy. Students should study their charts with care, remembering todifferentiate between the five Hierarchies which are the non-manifestingHierarchies, and the seven Hierarchies which are in expression now, and of whichthe sixth Creative Hierarchy is a part. This Hierarchy, from the larger angle ofthe entire twelve hierarchies and not simply the seven manifesting hierarchies,is the eleventh or the second. The sixth Ray of Devotion is consequently mostpowerful in this age or cycle and hence the expression in every land today ofits best and its worst features, of which the intense devotion to materialthings and the intense devotion to spiritual values are dramatic instances.Scorpio and Aquarius are also in a peculiar relation to each other through theplanet Mercury which governs the [219] human family (being the hierarchicalplanet in Scorpio), and through Neptune which rules Cancer, thus governingexpression upon the physical plane. In this connection the Moon is given as theorthodox ruler and the hierarchical rule of Aquarius. I would here remind youthat the Moon is usually regarded as “veiling” or “hiding” some planet and ofthese there are three which the Moon may be veiling. Here the intuition of theastrologer and of the esoteric student must be called out. These planets areVulcan, Neptune or Uranus. These three create and influence certain aspects ofthe Mother principle, which nourish and feed the life of the inner divinereality until the time comes when the Christ child is brought to the birth. Theydetermine or condition the physical, astral and mental natures, thus creatingthe personality. They form a triangle of immense creative potency, upon whichtheme I will later enlarge when dealing with the Science of Triangles. The pointwhich I am here making is that through the influence of Mercury and Neptune thegroup consciousness of the individual is developed, so that through the tests inScorpio and the experience in Aquarius the disciple emerges on the physicalplane into the position of a world server; all world servers are decentralisedworkers and are governed by the need and the reactions of the mass or group.That is one of the reasons why, when in training, disciples are absorbed into aMaster's group which is integrally a collection of individuals who are imbuedwith the group idea and are learning increasingly to react to it. In this worldperiod and in a peculiar manner, as far as the race (Aryan) to which the Westernworld belongs, Neptune is known esoterically as the Initiator. In certainancient formulas, the great Teacher of the West and the present world Initiator,Christ, [220] is spoken of as Neptune, Who rules the ocean, whose trident andastrological symbol signifies the Trinity in manifestation and Who is the rulerof the Piscean Age. The formula runs as follows, speaking esoterically: “... thefish goddesses who have leapt from earth (Virgo) to water (Pisces) unitedly givebirth to the Fish God (Christ) who introduces the water of life into the oceanof substance and thus brings light to the world. Thus does Neptune work.” Thisis, however, a great mystery, revealed only at the time of the second initiationin which the control of the fluidic astral plane is demonstrated.Cancer, being the door to incarnation, has a close relation to Scorpio throughNeptune and Mars, both of whom are expressions of the sixth ray energy. InCancer, you have the devotion of the soul, developed to such an extent that theurge to manifest overcomes all other urges, and the processes of incarnationimpose themselves upon the soul. In Scorpio, that same spirit of devotion (whichis based on the sense of duality and the need to go out towards that which isnot the Self) is turned in the reverse direction and the urge towards liberationand the desire to tread the Path of Return becomes so strong that the disciplesubmits to tests, reverses—at tremendous cost and pain—his position upon thewheel of life and assumes the attitude of the Observer in contradistinction tothat of the Experiencer. Old identifications cease; new trends toward higher,subtler and more spiritual identifications begin to appear and then Neptune andMars begin to play their part.A close study of all the above relations will reveal the fact that four signs ofthe zodiac play a dominant part, therefore, in the life of the man who isworking whilst in incarnation with his Sun in Scorpio or with Scorpio rising.These are: [221]1. Aries . . . . . . . . . Cardinal Cross . . . Initiating impulse . . . . . .Life. 2. Cancer . . . . . . . . Cardinal Cross . . . Focussed impulse . . . . .. Incarnation. 3. Scorpio . . . . . . . Fixed Cross . . . . . Reversing impulse. . . . . Return. 4. Aquarius . . . . . . Fixed Cross . . . . . Group impulse .. . . . . . . Service.These are signs 1-4-8-11. These numbers in themselves are most significant forthey are the signs of will-desire, of human expression, of the Christ principleand of initiation. There is no need for me to enlarge upon this fourfold themeand the truth of its implied teaching, for it is obvious and clear and thehistory of the soul is sealed up in these numbers.I would like to touch upon another interesting point which will serve todemonstrate the potency of Scorpio and its energies in the life of the disciple.Scorpio is one of the four arms of the Fixed Cross of the heavens, as you wellknow. Upon that Cross, the correctly poised man stands right at the centre wherethe four arms meet and, therefore, at the point where the energy of all the foursigns and of their ruling planets can pour through him and evoke the neededreactions, produce the conditions wherein test is possible and so bring aboutthe necessary reversal of the life currents in the man's nature and place himupon the reversed wheel. The planets which will rule and condition him in someaspect or other of his nature are:Planet Sign Ray School 1. Venus . . . . . . . . Taurus . . . . . . . 5th . . . .. . . Orthodox 2.

HierarchicalFrom this tabulation, it will appear that the influence of only one ray, that ofthe third Ray of Active Intelligence, [222] is missing. All the other rays pourthrough, vertically and horizontally, into the man's nature and his environment.Life, quality and appearance are all tested, but as the entire experience has tobe fought out subjectively and lifted “up into the air” finally and raised intothe world of spiritual values where all problems must be solved in the light ofthe intuition and by the soul, the stimulation of the intellect and thefocussing of the disciple's attention upon the physical plane (the world ofmaterial values) is not desirable. Therefore, the influence of the third ray isomitted or “occultly deflected,” as it is called, except in so far that thesubstance of the brain is automatically conditioned by the third ray which isthe subconscious ruler of matter. This pouring in of six potencies is that whichprovides the setting and conditions of the tests; all these ray energies expressthemselves as the active sub-rays of the ray upon which the soul of the discipleis found; hence the necessity to ascertain the ray of the soul, prior to castingthe horoscope and setting up the chart.This brings me to two points about which I would like to speak a word. Indealing with the horoscope of the personality and with the average non-aspiringman, the astrologer should endeavour to discover the personality ray from astudy of character, of the physical indications, of the emotional qualities, ofthe type of mind and the nature of the environment. He will then be able to layout a far more useful chart with the orthodox planets ruling the life. In thecase of the horoscope of a disciple, he should do the same, endeavouring todiscover the ray of the soul. The soul ray only sets its mark and emphasises itsquality and nature in the case of advanced people, and when that emergesclearly, the man is obviously a disciple and the esoteric planets will thengovern his chart. Having determined [223] the ray of the man undergoing tests inScorpio, the astrologer can then place the other rays in relation to him and hisprobable experience.The other point to which I sought to refer is the constant use of the word“relation” or “relationship” and analogous phrases. This is unavoidable for thereason that the entire Science of Astrology is, in the last analysis, theScience of Relations and there is consequently no use in avoiding the term,especially when there is no other which seems to meet the requirements asadequately. Inter-relation, inter-dependence, inter-communication,interplay—these are words governing the scientific basis of astrology, and theyare beginning to be words in general use today in connection with human affairsand human conduct. This will be increasingly the case. The preparatory stagesfor world fusion, blending and synthesis are present at this time, and in thisfact lies the hope of the world and the surety of the ultimate solution of theworld problem along right lines.In connection with the vertical and the horizontal life of the Fixed Cross, itis instructive to note that the vertical life of the man upon that Cross (nomatter in what sign his sun may temporarily find position), is everAquarius-Leo. This indicates that the self-centred individual in Leo learns thelesson of the Cross and becomes decentralised, group conscious, and given toservice. The horizontal arm is Taurus-Scorpio, indicating that desire formateriality is finally superseded by desire for the spiritual values, and thisis demonstrated through the tests in Scorpio. Earth and water (Taurus andScorpio) must be blended and related and it is this truth connected with thesetwo signs of the zodiac which lies behind all teaching upon baptism andpurification. The earthly material desires of Taurus must in [224] due time bebrought under the influence of the purifying water in Scorpio. Baptism by water(a name for the second initiation) needs a preparatory period of testing andpurification, and this the experience in Scorpio is intended to give. Likewise,fire and air (Aquarius and Leo) must also be blended and thus the four elementsas well as six out of the seven rays must all play their part in conditioningthe man in Scorpio for the final stages of the Path.The place of the planets in this sign is also most revealing, and in line alsowith the general purpose of the experience in Scorpio, as outlined above. Uranusis exalted in Scorpio; the power of Venus is lessened in this sign, whilst theMoon falls. What do these facts symbolically portray? Let me see if I can makethe beauty of these implications clear to you.Uranus is the planet whose characteristics are the scientific mind, which, atthis stage of the disciple's career, means that he can begin to live the occultlife and the way of divine knowledge can take the place of the mystic way offeeling. It means also that knowledge can be transmuted into the way of wisdomand of light. This necessarily brings in the will aspect or the influence of thefirst ray (Vulcan) blended with the seventh ray (Uranus) producing the desiredmanifestation upon the physical plane. Uranus, therefore, initiates a new orderof life and conditions and this—when developed in the life of the disciple—inits turn produces an understanding of the causes of things as they are, and thedesire to change the old order and the old orientation into the new. Thisproduces the reversal of the wheel. This can be seen happening today mostclearly in connection with humanity and with world processes. Carried forward toits logical conclusion, the influence of Uranus finally produces an unfoldedspiritual consciousness in contradistinction to [225] the human; for thisreason, Uranus is exalted in this sign and assumes a position of power and ofdirected influence.Venus , the intelligent mind, has its power lessened in this sign because theintellect—having been developed and used—must now be subordinated to a higherpower of the soul, the spiritual intuition. The Son of Mind, the solar Angel,must now manifest as a Son of God. This solar Angel, when in control, must giveplace eventually to the Presence. This it has hitherto veiled or hidden. Venusmust wane and the Sun—as a symbol of Deity—must wax in influence and finallytake its place. Such are the symbolic and esoteric significances.The Moon is here regarded as functioning in its true nature and, therefore, asexpressing symbolically that which is dead. The Moon here stands for thepersonality and, in the final victory in Scorpio, the personality is entirelyvanquished and defeated. Desire is killed, for it is through expressed desire ofsome kind that personality demonstrates life, quality, appearance. Ponder uponthis, for in Scorpio the Moon falls and its influence fades out.Extremes ever meet in the disciple who stands at this midway point or at thecentre of the Fixed Cross in Scorpio. The spiritual imagination, which is thefactor of greatest service to man, begins to take the place of the ancientglamour by means of which we have fabricated the untrue world in which we appearto live and move and have our being. The self-indulgence which was initiated inTaurus gives way in Scorpio to the selfless attitude of the disciple; ambitiongives place to the executive activity of the soul, whilst attachment topersonality desires, likes and dislikes is transmuted into the tenacity of soulpurpose. The hidden powers of the soul nature—secret and misused becausemisunderstood and misapplied and, therefore, misdirected—are [226] superseded bythe mysteries of initiation, and the practical understanding of the energiesthereby conferred upon the recipient. Such are some of the great transformationswhich take place in the life of the disciple who submits intelligently to thetests and difficulties in Scorpio.The three decanates and their rulers are given very differently by variousastrologers. One group posits Mars, the Sun and Venus as ruling the decanates ofScorpio whilst another regards Mars, Jupiter and the Moon as the three rulers.Perhaps the truth lies in both conclusions, if we view them from the esotericstandpoint or from that of the undeveloped man. This will be an interestingpoint for astrologers to investigate and study. Some day they will arrive at aclear decision as to the position of the five planets suggested as ruling thedecanates (they agree on one); I cannot indicate to you the essential truthbecause a new planet is arising in this sign and it is for man to discover andrightly place it within the circumference of the Great Wheel.The keywords of this sign are significant and illuminating. Deception andtriumph—control by Maya and control by the soul—conflict and peace—such are thehidden secrets of this sign and these are summed up for all disciples in the twokeywords. Upon the ordinary wheel, whereon the soul is found, blind andapparently helpless, the Word goes forth in the following terms: “And the Wordsaid, Let Maya flourish and let deception rule”; upon the reversed wheel, thesoul chants or sings the words: “Warrior I am and from the battle I emergetriumphant.”LIBRA, THE BALANCEThe sign Libra is one of peculiar interest, but in a most paradoxical manner,for much of its interest is based upon [227] the fact that it lacks spectacularinterest of any kind—except in the case of disciples or those nearing the Path.It is a sign of balancing, of careful weighing of values, and of achieving theright equilibrium between the pairs of opposites. It might be regarded as thesign in which the first real vision of the Path appears and of the goal towardswhich the disciple must ultimately direct his steps. This Path is the narrowrazor-edged Path which runs between the pairs of opposites and which—if it is tobe safely trodden—requires the development of a sense of values and the power toutilise rightly the balancing, analytical faculty of the mind. It is also thesign of intuitive perception and, on the ordinary way of progression around thezodiac, it comes after the normally drastic experience of the man in Scorpio;this is usually of such a nature that the instinct to self-preservation has beenaroused to such an extent that in the dire need of the man (not the disciple, atthis time) a call to the soul has gone forth and has evoked response. The firstfew faint flashes of the intuition have been sensed and vaguely recognised. Thenfollows the experience in Libra wherein a life is spent in quiet, thoughtfulreflection or in a condition of static unresponsiveness; it may be a life ofbalancing, of weighing this and that, and of determining which way the scalesshall fall so that in the next sign certain designed results will occur. Thefollowing Virgo life will be either one of a personality, materialistic nature,lived under the influence of the material aspect of Virgo, the Mother, or therewill be evidenced a slowly emerging soul vibration, indicating that hiddenspiritual life of which the Virgin Mother is the fore-ordained custodian. Asprogress is made, recurrently or cyclically, around the wheel of life, theseexperiences and vibratory activities intensify in character until the time comeswhen the reversal of the wheel [228] takes place. Then Libra leads on to Scorpioand the active soul life (active through the medium of the personality natureand not simply on its own plane) is registered, recorded and noted in Virgo, andbalanced and assessed in Libra, eventually bringing about the tests and trialsbetween the soul and the personality, which latter fights with power anddetermination to preserve the status quo of the balanced expression of these twowhere the preponderance of the personality influence is not possible.Libra can also be spoken of in terms of the meditation process as taught both inEast and West. It can, therefore, be regarded as the “interlude between twoactivities,” which is the explanation given to that stage in meditation which wecall contemplation. In the five stages of meditation (as usually taught) youhave the following: Concentration, meditation, contemplation, illumination andinspiration. These five stages are paralleled in the five strictly human signsof the zodiac:1. Leo—Concentration—Soul life focussed in form. Individualisation.Self-consciousness. Undeveloped and average man. Human experience.2. Virgo—Meditation—Soul life, as sensed in man, the gestation period. The stageof the hidden Christ. Intelligent man. Personality, as hiding the Christ life.3. Libra —Contemplation—Life of soul and form is balanced. Neither dominates.Equilibrium. An interlude wherein the soul organises itself for battle and thepersonality waits. This is the probationary path. Duality known.4. Scorpio—Illumination—The soul triumphs. Experience in Taurus consummated.Astral glamour dissipated. [229] Soul light pours in. The Path of Discipleship.The Disciple.5. Sagittarius—Inspiration—Preparation for initiation. Soul inspires personalitylife. Soul expresses itself through personality. The Initiate.I would here remind you that, though initiation is taken in Capricorn, the manis an initiate before he is initiated. This is the true secret of initiation.You have, therefore, the activity wherein the personality grows and develops,and yet at the same time it veils and hides the hidden “man of the heart,” whichis the Christ, within each human form. You have then the interlude wherein thepoint of balance is reached between these two and neither is dominant. The“scales tip back and forth” in either direction or—as it is sometimesexpressed—man swings between the pairs of opposites. Hence the importance ofthis sign in the life expression of the man and hence also its peculiardifficulty; it provides the curious see-saw experience which proves sodistressingly bewildering first to the man who seeks to be entirely human butfinds within himself impediments and urges which drive him on to something whichis higher than the human and, secondly, to the aspirant or the disciple. Hisfocus of interest and his aim is soul life, yet he finds within himself thatwhich seeks ever to draw him back to the old ways, the old habits and the olddesires.This sign is sometimes called “the place of judgment” for it is here that thedecision is made and the die is cast which separate the “sheep from the goats”or those constellations ruled by Aries (the Ram or Lamb) and those ruled byCapricorn, the Goat. It really marks the distinction between the ordinary wheelof life and the reversed [230] wheel. In the days before Leo-Virgo were dividedinto two signs, Libra was literally the midway point. The situation was then asfollows:Aries. Taurus. Gemini. Cancer. Leo-Virgo. LIBRA Scorpio. Sagittarius. Capricorn.Aquarius. Pisces.and in this round of the zodiac (as far as humanity is concerned) you havedepicted the entire history of the race. This involves its mental beginnings inAries (the will to manifest) and the start of the outgoing life; you have itsdirected desire in Taurus , producing manifestation; then emerges its dualconsciousness in Gemini or the soul-body realisation; the processes of physicalincarnation go forward in Cancer , followed by the dual development of thesoul-body, or the subjective and objective consciousness, and the God-man inLeo-Virgo . Next comes Libra , wherein the point of balance is eventuallyreached between spiritual man and personal man and the stage is laid for thefinal fivefold process which is, in reality, the subjective correspondence tothe outer externalisation upon the Path of Outgoing and which is carried forwardupon the Path of Ingoing, or the Path of Return. Then takes place the reversalof the wheel and the beginning of the new orientation and of discipleship inScorpio , the directed, controlled life of the disciple in Sagittarius ,initiation in Capricorn , followed by service in Aquarius and the work of aworld saviour in Pisces and final liberation.In this world period we have the division of the sign of the Sphinx into twosigns (the Lion and the Virgin, soul and form) because the state of humanevolution and conscious realisation is that of a recognised duality; it is onlyat what is called the “final judgment” that another fusion [231] will take placeand Virgo-Libra will form one sign, for then man's sense of antagonistic dualismwill be ended and the scales will have been turned finally in favour of thatwhich the Virgin-Mother has hidden from expression for aeons.This final judgment, as far as this planetary cycle is concerned, will takeplace in the next great world cycle and by that time two-thirds of the humanrace will have unfolded the Christ principle in one or other of the variousstages of unfoldment and be upon one of the final stages of the path ofevolution; they will be either probationary or accepted disciples or upon thePath of Initiation. Eventually, in some mysterious way, there will be only tensigns of the zodiac again; Aries and Pisces will form one sign, for “the end isas the beginning.” This dual and blended sign is called in some of the ancientbooks “the sign of the Fish with the head of the Ram.” We shall then have1. Aries-Pisces 6. Virgo-Libra 2. Taurus 7. Scorpio 3. Gemini 8. Sagittarius 4.Cancer 9. Capricorn 5. Leo 10. AquariusFire and water will then blend, veiling the past which has gone instead of thefuture as is now the case. Earth and air will then fuse and in this way the oldprophecy, repeated in the Bible, that “there shall be no more sea” will beproved correct. Air (heaven) will then have “come down to Earth” and fusion willbe established.In the cosmic sense then and not in the individual sense, the unfoldment of thecosmic Christ will be manifested for which “the whole creation waits”; thus willcome the consummation of desire as a result of dedicated aspiration. [232] Then,and only then, will the “Desire of all nations come” and He for Whom all menwait will appear.The history of desire is to be found in the four signs of Taurus, Libra, Scorpioand Pisces.1. Taurus the Bull of Desire. Material desire rules. (Life.) 2. Libra thebalancing of desire. The opposite objective to desire is the scales or balances.(Balance.) 3. Scorpio the victory of spiritual desire. The soul triumphant.(Quality.) 4. Pisces consummation of divine desire. The “Desire of all nations.”The Cosmic Christ. (Appearance.)There is therefore the individual experience in Libra of the balanced lifewherein experiment is made and the consequent tipping of the Scales in onedirection or another until either desire or spiritual aspiration weighs thebalances down sufficiently so as to indicate the way that the man must go at thetime. There is the experi ence of humanity in Libra in which the sameadjustments and experiments are being made, but this time the entire race of menis involved and not just an individual. This group experience, carried out uponthe mental plane, will only happen when all men are polarised mentally and willtake place and constitute the Judgment day, referred to above. Of this, the“point of crisis” in Libra and the present world situation and needed adjustmentis the forerunner; this time the balancing is, however, upon the astral planeand the desires [233] of men are predominantly in a position of casting thedeciding factor, whereas in the next great cycle it will be the minds of menwhich will do the deciding. Today, the foremost men of the age—disciples,aspirants and the intelligentsia—are being tested under the Scorpio experiencewhilst the masses are in the Scales; the weight of mass desire will turn themeither up towards spiritual decision or down towards material and selfish ends.It is because of this balancing quality in Libra that this constellation can beassociated more specifically with the problem of sex than can any of the others.Sex is usually connected in the mind of the average astrological student withthe signs Taurus and Scorpio. This is probably due to the fact that the Bull isso frequently regarded as the symbol of the mad urges of the uncontrolled sexprinciple and because in Scorpio fundamental tests are applied. For mostaspirants in the early stages, sex does constitute a fundamental problem.Esoterically, however, it is in Libra that the whole question comes up and willincreasingly come up for answering, and it is in Libra that the balancing of thepairs of opposites must take place and reach solution through the activity ofthe judicial mind and the establishing of a point of equilibrium between themale and the female principles. This again (for it is a piece of recurrentsymbology) is the problem existing basically between the Sheep and the Goats,between negative and positive, and between those who blindly follow eitherinstinct or custom and those who climb freely where they choose and areself-directed in conduct and attitude. This self-direction may lead them ineither direction upon the wheel of life, following either selfish desire orspiritual aspiration, but the point to have in mind is that, judicially and withintent and after due reflection and balancing of the various ways, they then[234] do as they will and as seems to them right and desirable. This is ofitself of a basic usefulness and thereby they learn; for all action producesresults and the judicial mind weighs cause and effect more correctly than anyother.It is not my intention here to indicate the solution of the problem of sex.Humanity will inevitably work it out as the aeons slip away and as the herdinstinct gives place to the premeditated and self-conscious attitudes of theaspirant and the intelligentsia. I would remind you, however, that the herdinstinct in relation to sex has its basis either in normal and natural animalinstinctual desire or in emotional attitudes, and of these the last category areby far the worst and carry with them by far the more deep-seated seeds oftrouble. They range all the way from the stage of free love and a generalpromiscuity to the orthodox narrow and bigoted Christian angle, as that isnormally understood though not in the sense in which Christ viewed life. Thisnarrow viewpoint and the normal Anglo-Saxon attitude (an outcome of the teachingof the Middle Ages) regard sex as unusually sinful, ever undesirable, and assomething to be lived down and overcome, and kept secretly in the background ofthe Christian consciousness, where it is hidden as a prurient mystery. Thisagain is due to the influence of St. Paul but not to the teaching of Christ.From these attitudes, there has been a violent reaction which is today at itsheight and this, in its turn, is both undesirable and dangerous, as are allviolent reactions, for the one is as untrue as the other; it is at the centre ofthe Scales or at the hub of the wheel that the true perspective and indicatedaction can be seen correctly. When the basic “sex” relation is finallyestablished and soul and body (negative and positive) are permanently related inthe lives of the world aspirants, then we shall see the right handling of the[235] world teaching on the subject of physical sex. This teaching will comefrom the merging and synthesis of the best views of all the spiritually mindedteachers in both hemispheres, embodying the experience of the East and of theWest, and of the mystical and the scientific approaches to a mystery which isboth physical (requiring scientific understanding) and mystical (requiringspiritual interpretation). It will involve the aid and conclusions of themedical profession in order to give the needed wise, physical instruction andthe aid also of the cultural knowledge of the yogis of India in connection withthe energy flowing through the centres—in this case the sacral centre. Finally,through the intelligent activity of the judicial and legal-minded men of theworld, the search for a balanced and desirable point of view will come to anend. Out of the many sexual experiments now going on, the coming generation willarrive at a point of balance and then, as a consequence, they will tip thescales in the desired and desirable direction. Of this there is no question ofdoubt; there is only the point in time and this will be astrologicallydetermined. Through the legal minds and through right legislation, sex will beseen eventually to be a proper and divine function and will then be safeguardedby right education of the young and the ignorant, and the right action of theyoung and highly intelligent emerging generation—the children and babies oftoday.The teaching of wrong sexual habits, the example of widespread prostitution (Iuse this word in connection with men as well as women), the growth ofhomosexuality (not in its rare physiological forms and predispositions but fromthe angle of a perverted mentality and an unwholesome imagination, which todaylie behind so much of its expression), the narrow-minded Christian inheritanceof a “guilt [236] complex” where sex is concerned, and the heritage of diseasedand over-or under-sexed physical bodies, have brought the race to its presentchaotic and unintelligent handling of the important problem. The solution willnot be found through religious pronouncements, based upon an outworn theory, orthrough physiological inhibition or legalised license; neither will it comethrough legislation, inspired by various schools of thought in any community ornation. It will be the result of the united activity of the spiritually mindedconsciousness, the judicial attitude, the intellectual perception and the steadyurge of the evolutionary process. Nothing can prevent the inevitability of thesolution and the appearance of desirable attitudes and conditions wherein sexcan find right expression.Libra, as you know, governs the legal profession and holds the balances betweenso-called right and wrong, between negative and positive and also between Eastand West. This last point of adjustment may seem to you to be a meaninglessphrase, but when the true and right relationship is established between theorient and the occident (which is not yet the case) it will come about throughthe activity of Libra and the work of the legal profession.Libra has been the “sponsor of the law.” Legislation has hitherto been engrossedwith the enforcing of those negations and those attitudes of fear which havebeen preserved for us in the Mosaic code and imposed through the medium ofpunishment for infringement. This has been a probably necessary stage for childraces and for the preservation of a “nursery regime” for men. But mankind isreaching maturity and a different interpretation of the purposes and intents ofLibra through the medium of law is now required. The law must become thecustodian of a positive righteousness and not simply the instrument ofenforcement. [237] Just as we are attempting to eliminate force out of ournational relationships, and just as it is obvious today that the process ofdrastic penalties has not succeeded in preventing crime or in deterring peoplefrom violent selfishness (for that is what all crime is), and just as the socialattitude (in contradistinction to the anti-social position of all law-breakers)is being regarded as desirable and taught in our schools, so it is beginning todawn upon the public consciousness that the inculcation of right relations andthe spread of self-control and the growth of unselfishness (and these surely arethe goal, subjective and oft unrealised, of all legal procedure) are the neededapproach to the young.The influence of Libra should be imposed in childhood along spiritual lines.Crime will be stamped out when the environing conditions in which children liveare bettered, when physical attention is given in the early formative years toglandular balance as well as to teeth and eyes and ears, to right posture andcorrect feeding, and when there is also a more proper apportionment of time;when esoteric psychology and esoteric astrology give their contribution ofknowledge to the bringing up of young people. The old methods must give way tothe new and the conservative attitude must be dropped in favour of religious,psychic and physical training and experiment, scientifically applied andmystically motivated. When I say religious, I do not refer to doctrinal ortheological teaching. I mean the cultivation of those attitudes and conditionswhich will evoke reality in man, bring the inner spiritual man to the foregroundof consciousness and thus produce the recognition of God Immanent.I must write no more along these lines. I have enlarged somewhat upon sex andthe judicial system as they are both [238] ruled and conditioned by Libra andthis will be increasingly the case. The subject is too vast and too importantfor me to do more than indicate lines of approach. A cursory handling of theproblem is of no real usefulness. In this transition period through which theworld is now passing and in this interlude between two activities—that of thePiscean Age which is passing and that of Aquarius which is coming in—Libra willeventually rule, and the end of this century will see the influence of Librasteadily coming into pronounced control and into a position of power in theplanetary horoscope. There is, therefore, no need for real anxiety.A certain relationship or configuration of stars—of which one is the starRegulus, in Leo—will bring about a situation wherein the re-orientation of theattitude of the legal profession will take place; its functions and duties willbe centralised for the purpose of world usefulness, and in this processlegislation for children will assume great importance and be the motivatingpower. This legal step will be primarily advocated by Russia and endorsed by theUnited States of America. Before 2035 A.D. such legislation will be universal inits sphere of influence and control.All this will come about because Libra rules the present interlude and might beregarded as “the master of no-man's land,” as one of the Masters of the Wisdomcalled it lately.A study of The Bhagavad Gita and of Arjuna's problem when he sat down in despairbetween the two opposing armies will be found most illuminating in connectionwith Libra. The great battle which is related in that ancient scripture of Indiareally took place in the first instance in mid-Atlantean days and in the signLibra. The major conflict of this present, Aryan period is being waged upon ahigher turn of the spiral and is under the influence of Scorpio. [239] That inthe past prepared the world probationary disciple, humanity, for the path oftrue discipleship. That in the present is preparing the world disciple to takeinitiation. During the vast interim between the Atlantean decisive happening andthe present time, a great re-orientation upon the wheel of life has taken place;since then, several million men have passed from Scorpio into Libra(symbolically speaking) and there have been “weighed in the balances” and haveafterwards refocussed their desire life towards spiritual aspiration andreinforced their determination to move forward and thus have returned intoScorpio upon the reversing wheel. Ponder upon this thought, for this constitutesthe real problem for the masses of intelligent men at this time.As you already know, Libra is one of the four arms of the Cardinal Cross. Thisaccounts for our difficulty in understanding the real nature of its influence.The significance of the energies working out into our solar system through themedium of the four arms of this Cross, or from the four constellations, Aries,Cancer, Libra and Capricorn, can be summed up in the four words: Creation,Manifestation, Legislation and Initiation . Having given you these words, theirvery scope and meaning make it hard for you to understand.Cosmically, they mean the activity of Deity when spirit and matter are broughtinto a definite relationship and, under divine purpose, produce that fusion ofliving energies which will be adequately potent in time and space to bring thatpurpose to its desired consummation. This is Creation, or Aries in activity.They mean also the objective appearing of the thoughtform which God has thuscreated and in which is embodied His desire, His will, His purpose and His plan.This is Manifestation, or Cancer in activity. They mean again the working out ofthe plan under [240] spiritual and natural law which is evolutionary inexpression; this is the goal of evolution and its expression and is steadilyrevealing the nature of God, for the laws under which this solar system of oursis governed are expressions of God's quality and character. This is Legislation,or Libra in activity. They mean, finally, the processes of initiation wherein,step by step and stage by stage, under law and through the method of gainedexperience whilst in manifestation, the creative plan is realised inconsciousness. The unfoldment of the plan is thus carried forward through aprogressed series of beginnings, of manifestations, and of consummations—allrelative in nature but leading to an absolute consummation. This is Initiation,or activity in Capricorn. All this is on a somewhat vast and incomprehensiblescale as far as the human understanding is concerned.But consciousness and understanding of the larger purpose which lies behind themore exoteric intent of the unfoldment of the consciousness in this solarsystem, in the planet and in man, has to be grasped eventually towards the finalstages of the evolutionary process. When this understanding unfolds, then manbecomes an initiate, vacates his position upon the Fixed Cross and begins therelatively slow process of mounting the Cardinal Cross. Then he becomes acooperator in the great creative process and purpose. He begins to create hisown body of expression upon the Cardinal Cross and the impulse of Aries beginsto appear to him. As yet he understands it not. He manifests consciously in theworld that which he intends to carry forward and Cancer then reveals to him itssecret. He becomes his own legislator , ruling his conduct wisely, controllinghis impulses intellectually and then Libra enables him to balance the materialand the spiritual law. When he has done all this, [241] he discovers himselfready to enter into new and deeper experiments (should I call them experiences?)and as a participator in the divine plan and as a cooperator in the divinepurpose, he then becomes his own initiator and is thus ready to take initiation.Such are the paradoxes of the spiritual life. But the secret of the CardinalCross is revealed only to the man who has mounted the Fixed Cross and gonethrough its fourfold experience. It is not possible to say more than what I havesaid.Libra is an air sign; there are three air signs in the zodiac and theirinter-relation makes a most interesting study and well worth the closeinvestigation of the student as are all these major triplicities. Each of thesesigns is to he found in one or other of the three Crosses:1. Gemini, the Twins . . . . . . . . . . Mutable Cross . . . . . . Duality. 2.Libra, the Balances . . . . . . . . . Cardinal Cross . . . . . Equilibrium. 3.Aquarius, the Water-Carrier . . . Fixed Cross . . . . . . . . Initiation.These three, therefore, stand for duality—sensed, overcome and resolved into thesynthesis of the great World Server, identified with the Heavenly Man andbringing his contribution, wrested in his experience upon the wheel of life fromthe sum total of energy, to the service of the Whole. Forget not that initiationis but another name for synthesis and fusion.From another angle, you have:1. Gemini, the Twins . . . . . . . . . . Mind . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Causeof duality. 2. Libra, the Balances . . . . . . . . . Supermind . . . . . . . . .Cause of synthesis. 3. Aquarius, the Water-Carrier . . . Universal Mind . . . .. Soul.These three signs are pre-eminently signs of the Mind of God as it expressesitself through man; the lower mind dominates at first, causing the recognitionof the Self and the Not-Self, or the essential dualism which underlies allmanifestation; the higher mind, however, steadily increases [242] its power andcontrol, producing the balancing of the pairs of opposites through theillumination which it brings to the lower mind, and then the Soul, the eternalSon of Mind, becomes the ultimate synthesis, focussing and relating theuniversal mind to the two lower aspects of the Mind of God.These hints should serve to show you one of the great inter-relations whichexist between the three Crosses, and with these we shall later deal whendiscussing them in greater detail in another part of this section on esotericastrology.It is interesting that in the note to Tabulation V both Libra and Gemini areomitted from the list. This is not an oversight but a point of true significanceand an omission warranting recognition. This omission is based on two facts:First, that there was a time, as you have heard, when there were only ten signs,and in those ancient days as in the present time, there was a divergence ofopinion among the astrological scientists; they differed as to which the tensigns might be and in this connection there were several schools of thought, butmainly two of importance. One group fused or made one sign out of Leo-Virgo andperpetuated their belief in the Sphinx; the other omitted Gemini and Libraaltogether. They were of an earlier date than the latter who in reality had azodiac of eleven signs. This is a fact of importance to you today. The otherpoint of note and of a relative importance is that Gemini and Libra are the twostrictly human signs; they are the signs of the ordinary man. Gemini upon theMutable Cross stands for man's humanity, whilst Libra upon the Cardinal Crossrules man's subjective and spiritual life. The other signs in their consummationcarry man beyond the stage of [243] ordinary humanity and produce the followingstates of consciousness:1. Aries and Virgo.—The Cosmic Christ. Universal and individual.2. Taurus and Pisces.—The world Saviours; i.e., Buddha and Christ.3. Leo and Aquarius.—The world Servers; i.e., Hercules.4. Sagittarius and Capricorn.—The world Initiates; i.e., Masters.5. Cancer and Scorpio.—The triumphant Disciples.The emphasis, however, on Gemini and Libra as far as humanity is concerned is onhuman attainment and achieving the point of balance before the other attainmentsbecome possible.It is also peculiarly instructive to study the rulers of this sign. From theangle of orthodox astrology, Venus rules Libra, whilst—esotericallyspeaking—Uranus rules. Saturn is the ruler in this sign of that stupendousCreative Hierarchy which is one of the three major groups of Builders, formingpart of the third aspect of divinity; Their goal is the giving of form to theSons of Mind and thereby offering opportunity for sacrifice and service. A studyof the relation of this Hierarchy to that of the human egos, the fourth CreativeHierarchy, will prove most illuminating and is handled somewhat in my earlierTreatise on Cosmic Fire . The nature and purpose of the three rulers will emergewith clarity if this is done.This sign is consequently closely connected with the third aspect of the Godheadand hence it is a governing sign and a major conditioning factor where Law, Sexand Money are concerned. Ponder on this. All the three divine aspects [244] inthemselves are triune and manifest in three manners or through three lesseraspects and this third aspect is no exception to this rule underlying all thetriplicities which condition the processes of evolution and manifestation. It isthrough a study of Libra that light upon the third aspect will come. The firstaspect of will or power expresses itself in this sign as Law, as legislation,legality, justice; the second aspect manifests as the relation between the pairsof opposites (of which the scales are the symbol) and upon the physical planeshows itself as Sex; the third aspect demonstrates as concretised energy andthis we call Money. It is literally gold and this is the externalised symbol ofthat which is created by the bringing together of spirit and matter upon thephysical plane. The third aspect is, as you know, the creator aspect and theenergy which produces the outer tangible plane of manifestation—the form side oflife.If students will, therefore, make a careful study of these three—law, sex andmoney—as they express themselves today and as they can express themselves in thefuture, they will have a picture of physical human achievement and of futurespiritual expression which will be instructive and most worthwhile. The wholeprocess is accounted for by the activity of the three rulers of Libra: Venus,Uranus and Saturn.Venus rules in Taurus, Libra and Capricorn, and is the source of the intelligentmind, acting either through desire (in the early stages) or love (in the laterstages). In Taurus, this means the mind expressing itself through intelligentdesire, for that is the goal of knowledge for ordinary man. In Libra, the pointof balance or equilibrium is attained between material personal desire andintelligent spiritual love, for the two qualities of cosmic desire are [245]brought to the fore in the consciousness in Libra and balanced one against theother. In Capricorn, it stands for spiritual love, expressing itself perfectlywhen the work in Taurus and Libra has been accomplished. Thus can the goldenthread of evolutionary progress be traced throughout the zodiacal path from signto sign, and thus the history of humanity can be seen and its goal visioned. Atsome later date, the same golden thread can be traced in connection with theother kingdoms in nature, but the time is not yet and such a theme would proveprofitless and unimportant. When, however, the consciousness of man is opened upin such a manner that it can register that which is proceeding and taking placein the three lower kingdoms in nature, then further light and information willbe given. This will take place in a period of human history when Libra isdominant and the three divine aspects of the third Person of the Trinity, theHoly Spirit, the Creator—law, sex and money—will give the clue to the threelower kingdoms. Law, natural law (the externalisation of the subjectivespiritual law) will give the clue to the animal kingdom; sex or theconsciousness of affinity will reveal the mystery of the vegetable kingdom;money will unveil the secret of the mineral kingdom and all this will come aboutthrough the activity of Venus and when this activity in the three signs ofTaurus, Libra and Capricorn is better understood. This I shall further elucidatewhen we come to study the Science of Triangles at a later date. Suffice it tosay here that each of these three signs is related to one of these three aspectsof divine life:1. Taurus—animal kingdom—law—natural law.2. Libra—vegetable kingdom—sex—natural affinity.3. Capricorn—mineral kingdom—money—concrete expression of the Law of Supply,[246] and all these form a triangle with Libra at the apex and dominating.Uranus is the esoteric ruler and is of supreme importance in this sign for theseventh ray works through this planet and is the embodiment of the principle ofconcretion and the materialising of that which is in need of objectivemanifestation, through the bringing together of spirit and matter. It is herethat the whole mystery of money lies hid and the creation and production ofmoney. I would like here to point out to you that it is with the third aspect ofdivinity and the third aspect alone that the creative process is concerned. Itis through the relation of the three aspects of the third divinemanifestation—law, affinity and concretised energy—that money is created.It is here that many mystics and world servers prove futile. They work from fartoo high a level and from the standpoint of spiritual incentive. They normallyand naturally (because that is where their focus of consciousness is placed)work from the standpoint of the second aspect, whereas it is the third aspect(equally divine and equally important) which must be invoked and evoked. Ponderupon these words. It is not the bringing together of spirit and matter asoccultism understands those terms but the relating of physical need and physicalsupply and the bringing together of two tangibles through the power of thecreative imagination. It is for this reason that so many schools of thoughtprove so successful in materialising that which is required and why otherschools of thought so signally fail. They work from too high a plane and havenot the ability to carry through . I have here given you hints which can befruitful of result if interpreted correctly and acted upon from right motive, ingroup formation and with selfless purpose.[247] Through this planet, Uranus, Libra is related also to Aries and Aquariusand it is through Uranus that the great pair of opposites, Aries-Libra, arebrought into touch with each other in a very deep sense. Through its activity,an intense interplay takes place, making for the attainment of equilibrium inLibra of that which had its beginning in Aries. Aries, Libra and Aquariusconstitute therefore another triangle of power which must later be considered;these triangles will, as I have earlier hinted, dominate the new astrology in amost interesting manner and condition the charts of those whose horoscopes arebeing considered.Libra is related, therefore, to five signs of the zodiac—Aries, Taurus, Gemini,Capricorn and Aquarius.1. Aries . . . . . . . . . Beginning . . . . . . . Creation . . . . . . . .Evolution. 2. Taurus . . . . . . . . Desire . . . . . . . . . . Incentive . . .. . . . . Progress. 3. Gemini . . . . . . . Duality . . . . . . . . . Condition. . . . . . . Interplay. 4. Capricorn . . . . . Synthesis . . . . . . .Initiation . . . . . . . . Attainment. 5. Aquarius . . . . . . Objective . . . .. . . Inclusion . . . . . . . . Service.This relation is established by the three rulers: Venus, Uranus and Saturn.These five, with Libra at the point of balance, create one of the six-pointedstars of evolution and also bring into relation with them three planets whichare peculiarly concerned with the expression of the Christ consciousness in theworld. These three planets are (through the rays of which they are the medium)all to be found upon the first major line of force, the line of will or powerand of purpose and visioned goal.1. Uranus.—7th Ray of Ceremonial Magic. God the Father . He who relates. TheSource of Duality. He who perceives the end from the beginning. Spiritualconsciousness.Intuition to Inspiration.[248] 2. Venus.—5th Ray of Mind. God the Son. The Son of Mind. He who includes.Egoic consciousness.Intellect to Intuition.3. Saturn.—3rd Ray of Intelligence. God the Holy Spirit . He who knows. Mind.Human Consciousness.Instinct to Intellect.It is for this basic reason—founded upon the above triple relationship—thatLibra is the “point of balance” in the zodiac. In most of the otherconstellations, at some stage or other, there comes a “point of crisis” whereinthe effect of the energy pouring through the sign (via the ruling planets) toman is at its highest point of effectiveness. This in time precipitates thecrisis which is required to release the man from the planetary influences whichcondition his personality and bring him more definitely and consciously underthe influence of the sign of the zodiac. But in Libra there is no such point ofcrisis any more than there is in Aries. There is only the interlude of balanceas a prelude to a more effective and sensitive progress upon the path. It is thesame in Aries. As it is esoterically said: “Before creation, silence and thestillness of a focussed point.” This applies to both Aries and Libra—the one ina cosmic and creative sense and the other in an individual and progressiveevolutionary sense.The following planets and their rays govern the Cardinal Cross of which Libra isone of the points:1. Mars . . . . . . . . 6th Ray . . . . . . . . . Idealism . . . Devotion . . .Struggle. 2. Mercury . . . . . 4th Ray . . . . . . . . . Harmony throughConflict. 3. Uranus . . . . . . 7th Ray . . . . . . . . . Ceremonial Order, Lawor Magic. 4. Venus . . . . . . . 5th Ray . . . . . . . . . Concrete Knowledge orScience. 5. Saturn . . . . . . . 3rd Ray . . . . . . . . . Active Intelligence.6. Neptune . . . . . 6th Ray . . . . . . . . . Idealism . . . Devotion . . .Struggle.[249] Here we have six planets and five rays of energy and the expression of thetwo lines of spiritual energy; Love-Wisdom in two of the rays and planets, andthree of the rays and planets upon the first major stream of energy, will orpower. You will note how three of these rays definitely predispose the Libransubject to concrete understanding, to intelligent will and to knowledge: thefirst ray (functioning through the 3rd and 5th rays) the fifth ray and the thirdray. Hence the effectiveness of Libra upon the physical plane and the power ofthe developed Libran to project the inner spiritual purpose or intended willinto physical expression. An instance of a person, equipped to do this, can beseen in H. P. Blavatsky.In this sign, Saturn is exalted for—at the point of balance—opportunity comesand a situation is staged which makes a choice and a determination inevitable.It is a choice which has to be made intelligently and upon the physical plane,in the waking brain consciousness. It is only now that the full purpose and thework of Saturn for humanity can reach a point of group usefulness, for it isonly now that humanity has reached a point of general and widespreadintelligence which can make any choice a definite conscious act, entailingresponsibility. Prior to the present time, only a few pioneering disciples and ahandful of intelligent people could be regarded as freely choosing at the “pointof balance” the way that they intend “to tip the scales.” Today, there arecountless numbers and hence the intense activity of Saturn as we enter into thefirst decan of Aquarius and hence the same activity because humanity itself nowstands upon the probationary path. This, Libra governs and controls, thereforethe path of choices, of deliberately applied purificatory measures and theturning point [250] before Scorpio, which governs the path of discipleship, canproperly play its part.The power of Mars is lessened in Libra; this is the sign of interlude and Marsis temporarily quiescent, prior to gathering his forces for a renewed effort inScorpio or for the “quickening” of the spiritual life in Virgo, according towhich way the wheel is turning for the man.The Sun “falls” in this sign because again neither the personality nor the souldominates in the man who is a pure Libran; a balance is achieved and thus theyesoterically “tune each other out.” Neither the voice of the personality nor ofthe soul is heard particularly but, as the Old Commentary puts it, “a gentleoscillation now proceeds. No strident note is heard; no violent colouring of thelife affects (I know not how else to translate the original phrases) and noupsetting of the chariot of the soul.” The significance of the place of theplanets in this sign will emerge clearly in your consciousness when you studythem with care and the meaning of Libra will become definitely formulated inyour mind. The characteristics of this sign are not easy to define or comprehendbecause they are in reality the synthesis of all past qualities and achievementsand any clear presentation of the pairs of opposites is difficult to get. Asregards man upon the probationary path or upon the verge of treading it, itmight be said that his characteristics and qualities in this sign are:BALANCE OF THE OPPOSITES IN LIBRAFickleness and variability . . . . . . A secure and settled position. Imbalance. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Balance. Bias. Prejudice . . . . . . . . . .. . . . Justice. Judgment. Dull stupidity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Enthusiastic wisdom. Untrue, showy outer form life . . True correct expression.Intrigue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straightforward conduct.Materialistic attitudes . . . . . . . . . Spiritual attitudes.[251] It is the balancing between the pairs of opposites which makes the man inLibra sometimes difficult to understand; he appears to vacillate but never forlong and often unnoticeably, for there is always the final balancing of thequalities with which he is equipped.The rulers of the decanates in this sign are again dual in their presentation bydifferent schools of astrologers. Sepharial gives us the Moon, Saturn andJupiter, whilst Alan Leo posits the controlling planets as Venus, Saturn andMercury. In this case, as in some others, the truth lies between the two or in acombination of both. The true rulers of the decanates in Libra are Jupiter,Saturn and Mercury. I need not enlarge upon their effect except to point outthat the result of the Jupiterian influence is to “open the door of the womb” inVirgo—a planet which we shall consider when we study that sign of the zodiac,which is our next undertaking.The words or keynotes of this sign are so clear and plain that any elucidationof mine would serve but to confuse the issue. They speak straight to the heartand without obscurity. To the average man with no developed spiritualconsciousness, the word goes forth again and again throughout the aeons: “Andthe Word said: Let choice be made.” The response eventually comes back as aresult of the evolutionary process and from the soul: “I choose the way whichleads between the two great lines of force.”VIRGO, THE VIRGINThe sign Virgo is one of the most significant in the zodiac for its symbologyconcerns the whole goal of the evolutionary process which is to shield, nurtureand finally [252] reveal the hidden spiritual reality. This every form veils,but the human form is equipped and fitted to manifest it in a manner differentto any other expression of divinity and so make tangible and objective that forwhich the whole creative process was intended. Gemini and Virgo are closelyrelated but Gemini presents the pairs of opposites—soul and body—as two separateentities whereas in Virgo, they are blended and of great and supreme importanceto each other; the mother protects the germ of the Christ life; matter guards,cherishes and nurtures the hidden soul. The keynote which embodies the truth asto the mission of Virgo most accurately is “Christ in you, the hope of glory.”There is no clearer or more adequate definition of this sign than that; I wouldhave you bear it in mind throughout our discussion upon this sixth sign of thezodiac (or the seventh if one is not considering the reversed wheel).In all the great world religions, the Virgin Mother appears and this a study ofany book upon comparative religion would prove. I cannot trace for you at lengththis universal recognition of the task of Virgo; it is needless for me to do soas it has been adequately done by many research scholars. I would, however,point out that four of the names whereby the Virgin is called are familiar toall of us, and tell us much as a whole concerning the form nature of which theVirgin is the symbol. The word Virgo itself is a descendant of and a corruptionof an ancient Atlantean root name which was applied to the mother principle inthose far off times. This Virgin was the founder of the matriarchate which thendominated civilisation and to which various myths and legends bear evidence andwhich have come down to us concerning Lilith, the last of the Virgin Goddessesof Atlantean times; the same thought is also to be found in the traditionaryaccounts of the ancient [253] Amazons, whose queen Hercules defeated, wrestingfrom her what he sought. This is an allegory, teaching the emergence of thespiritual man from the control of matter. Three of these goddesses are Eve ,Isis , and Mary . They are of peculiar and significant importance where ourcivilisation is concerned for they embody in themselves the symbology of theentire form nature, which, when integrated and functioning as a whole person, wecall the personality. This personality is (as far as humanity is concerned) thedeveloped and qualified expression of the third aspect of divinity, that of Godthe Holy Spirit, the active intelligent and nurturing principle of the universe.This aspect we shall study in Leo and see there the unfoldment of thatself-conscious entity and personality which in Virgo becomes the mother of theChrist child. Eve is the symbol of the mental nature, and of the mind of manattracted by the lure of knowledge to be gained through the experience ofincarnation. Eve , therefore, took the apple of knowledge from the serpent ofmatter and started the long human undertaking of experiment, experience andexpression which was initiated—from the mental angle—in our Aryan times. Isisstands for this same expression down on to the emotional or astral plane. Evehas no child in her arms; the germ of the Christ life is as yet too small tomake its presence felt; the involutionary process is yet too close; but in Isisthe midway point is reached; the quickening of that which is desired (the Desireof all nations, as it is called in the Bible) has taken place and Isisconsequently stands in the ancient zodiacs for fertility, for motherhood and asthe guardian of the child. Mary carries the process down to the plane or placeof incarnation, the physical plane, and there gives birth to the Christ child.In these three Virgins and these three Mothers of the Christ, you have thehistory [254] of the formation and the function of the three aspects of thepersonality through which the Christ must find expression. The sign of Virgoitself stands for a synthesis of these three feminine aspects—Eve, Isis andMary. She is the Virgin Mother, providing that which is needed for the mental,emotional and physical expression of the hidden but ever present divinity. Thesethree expressions are brought to the needed perfection in Leo, the sign of theindividual, developed self-consciousness and personality unfoldment.Virgo is, therefore, the opposite pole of spirit and stands for the relation ofthese two after they have been brought together originally in Aries and haveproduced a recognised duality in Gemini.I would here remind you of something which may at first serve to add to thepossible confusion already existing in your minds but which lies behind all thatI have given you. We have talked of the two ways of proceeding around thezodiac:—the ordinary way from Aries to Taurus, via Pisces, and the esoteric wayfrom Aries to Pisces, via Taurus. These refer to human evolution, which is theonly one which we are considering in this treatise. But in the majorinvolutionary cycle which concerns the mass movement of spirit-matter, and notthe individualised progress of man, the movement is from Aries to Pisces, viaTaurus. The secret of the original sin of man is hidden in this truth, for awrong orientation took place at one stage in human history and the human familywent—as a whole—against the normal zodiacal current, so to speak, and it is onlyupon the path of discipleship that right orientation is achieved and humanityswings into the correct rhythm of progress. I would ask you, therefore, todifferentiate between the involutionary process which affects the great CreativeHierarchies [255] and the evolutionary processes which affect the fourthCreative Hierarchy, the human. This, however, we are not really in a position tostudy, because when the evolutionary cycle is upon us, we ourselves are tooclosely identified with the process to be able to distinguish clearly betweenthe cosmic Self and Not-self; we are only as yet learning to distinguish theSelf and the Not-self on a tiny scale in connection with our own unfoldment. Itis only when we are identified with the Hierarchy of our planet and with thatcentre of spiritual force which it is the immediate objective of those upon thepath of discipleship to contact that it becomes possible for us to grasp—on theevolutionary arc—those broad outlines and those major sweeps of divine energywhich are present upon the involutionary arc. It is for this reason that a studyof the zodiac in connection with the subhuman kingdoms of nature is not as yetpossible.Virgo is, therefore, the cosmic mother because she represents cosmically thenegative pole to positive spirit; she is the receptive agent where the Fatheraspect is concerned. In a previous solar system, this matter aspect was thesupreme controlling factor, just as in this solar system it is the soul or theChrist principle which is of paramount importance. Virgo is, from certainangles, quite the oldest of all the signs, which is a statement I am quiteunable to prove to you. In that first system, the faint symptoms (if I may usesuch a word) of the duality which is a proven fact in this system are to befound, and this truth is preserved for us in the words that “the Holy Spiritovershadowed the Virgin Mary.” The life of the third divine aspect played thenupon the ocean of quiescent matter and prepared that substance (over untoldaeons) for its work in this solar system. It is in this system that the ChristChild, the expression [256] of the divine consciousness and the result of therelationship of Father-Spirit and Mother-Matter, must he brought to the birth.Another sign of the zodiac which is also closely related to the previous solarsystem is Cancer; it might be said that Cancer is an expression (in the stage ofgreat advancement) of the first half of the life cycle in solar system one,whilst Virgo is an equally advanced expression of the second half. In an effortto grasp the situation, it should he remembered that the consciousness aspect,as we understand the ability to be aware, was lacking entirely except in such anembryonic manner that the whole process resembled the stage of the embryo in thewomb, prior to the quickening at the middle point of the gestation process. Itwill, however, do none of you any harm to exert the imaginative faculty and thusget a vague and faint idea of the synthesis of the great evolutionary schemewhich, in a cosmic sense, concerns the threefold personality of Deity. With thisI attempted to deal in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire .This is the sixth sign and of it the six-pointed star is the ancient symbol,portraying as it does the process of involution, and also that of evolution,carried to the point of balance, expressed for us in the relationship of Virgoto Libra. You will note, if you consult the dictionary, that astronomicallyVirgo is regarded as occupying the place in the heavens where Libra is to befound. This is all part of the great illusion which astrology finds hard tograsp. There is a constant moving and shifting in space; the precession of theequinoxes is both a fact and an illusion. The whole process and itsinterpretation is dependent upon the intellectual point in evolution of therace; the responsiveness of man to the planetary forces and to the influence ofthe [257] zodiacal signs is dependent upon man's vehicles of response and uponthe mechanism of reception with which he enters into incarnation. The heavens,the constellations, signs and planets mean one thing to the Hierarchy andanother thing to the astronomers and still another thing to the astrologers,whilst they are simply bewildering galaxies of light to the average citizen. Ifeel the need to remind you of this and to point out to you that astronomicalfacts are only relative as regards the true and factual nature of that aboutwhich scientific pronouncement is made; they are declarative of life and potencybut not as science and the average man understand them. From the standpoint ofesoteric truth, they are simply embodied Lives and the expression of the life,the quality, the purpose and the intent of the Beings Who have brought them intomanifestation.As you well know, Virgo is one of the four arms of the Mutable Cross, and—as youalso know—the four energies which constitute this Cross (for the three Crossesare crossed streams of energy) are expressive of the whole goal of man in fourdefinite stages. This Mutable Cross is sometimes called “the Cross of Rebirth,”emphasising the constant mutation of which it is the symbol and also the “Crossof Changing Lives.” It pictorially represents the four critical points ormovements in the span of existence of the soul in manifestation:I. Gemini.1. Essential unrelated duality. The Twins.2. Sensed and recognised duality througha. Mass fusion in Cancer.b. Individual consciousness in Leo.The stage of Humanity. [258]II. Virgo.1. The period of the hidden germ of spiritual life.2. The period of the active germ of spiritual life.a. Gestation in the early stages.b. The stage of quickened life.The stage of Probation or Awakening.III. Sagittarius.1. Sense of duality ended. Fusion attained.2. The one-pointed direct life.The stage of Discipleship.IV. Pisces.1. Duality linked in synthesis. Compare symbols for Gemini and Pisces.2. The emergence of the World Saviour.The stage of Initiation.Throughout this relation and as a result of the steady unfoldment of the soulprinciple runs the theme of service. In Gemini , the relation between the greatduality of soul and body emerges in which, at this stage, the body or formserves the soul. In Virgo , matter or substance exchange or interchange theirservice and each serves the other. In Sagittarius , we find emerging the serviceof the One Life in terms of the service of the Hierarchy, the planetaryexpression of the idea of service, whilst in Pisces , there appears—as a resultof the entire evolutionary process—the dedicated, trained and tested worldServer or Saviour. It has been said that Virgo “involves the service of theimmediately present” or in other words that God immanent evokes reaction fromthe form side and is thereby served.[259] The three Crosses—cosmic, systemic and human—are profoundly interesting intheir inter-relation; this we shall discover when we come to study with caretheir significance, position and energising effect in the zodiac—both upon ourplanet and upon each other. This we shall do in a later part of this section ofthe Treatise.Virgo belongs to the earthy triplicity and an understanding of this triplicitywill also be found illuminating. The three earth signs areTaurus-Virgo-Capricorn and they are related to each other in a peculiar way inconnection with the non-sacred planet, our Earth. The relation with which we areconcerned is that of the meeting and fusion of the energies of these three signsupon the Earth and their effect upon the kingdoms in nature which our Earthmanifests. It might be said that:1. Taurus.—Incentive behind evolution (Impulse). Desire for experience, forsatisfaction.The Light of Knowledge2. Virgo.—Incentive behind discipleship (Goal). Desire for expression, spiritualdesire.The Hidden Light of God3. Capricorn.—Incentive behind initiation (Service). Desire for liberation.Service desire.The Light of LifeAll these express desire as it merges into aspiration and in the process bringslight and life to man. In Virgo, the purpose for which form life exists beginsto be realised and the desire for personality satisfaction begins to change andthe desire of man for interior recognition of the indwelling Christ begins toassume increasing control until the inner spiritual reality is eventuallyreleased from the thralldom of [260] matter and becomes manifest in its own truenature in the world. Putting the same thought in other terms, the light ofknowledge of which Taurus is the custodian gives place to the light of wisdom ofwhich Virgo is the guardian, and yields finally to the light of initiation inCapricorn. All this, however, takes place and must take place upon what isesoterically called “the radiant surface of the earth,” the plane of form; theassumption or glorification of the Virgin has not yet taken place and theraising up of substance is not yet realised. It is interesting to note thatScorpio establishes the inevitability of this final assumption of matter intoheaven in Capricorn, and this is pre-visioned for us in the story of Hercules inScorpio when he raises the Hydra high above his head into the air.Virgo symbolises depths, darkness, quiet and warmth; it is the valley of deepexperience wherein secrets are discovered and eventually “brought to light”; itis the place of slow, gentle and yet powerful crises and periodic developmentswhich take place in the dark and yet which lead to light. It is the “blindedstage” which is found in Masonic rituals and which ever precedes the gift oflight. Virgo stands for the “womb of time” wherein God's plan (the mystery andthe secret of the ages) is slowly matured and—with pain and discomfort andthrough struggle and conflict—brought into manifestation at the end of theappointed time. Today it would seem (curiously and convincingly) that we areentering into the eighth month of the gestation period; this is almost literallythe case where humanity is concerned for—counting from Virgo to Aquarius, thesign into which we are now entering—we find that there are just eight signs:Virgo, Leo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aries, Pisces and Aquarius, and this issurely the guarantee [261] that the birth of the new age, of the newconsciousness and the new civilisation and culture is inevitable and sure.I would like to pause here and make one point somewhat clearer in connectionwith the passage of human life around the zodiac. This progress or passage fallsinto three major divisions:1. The passage or progress of humanity around and around the zodiac from Ariesto Pisces, via Taurus , until in Virgo-Leo (for these two signs are regardedesoterically as inseparable) the mass movement releases the individual to a lifeof self-conscious progress and a changed mode of progression around the wheel oflife. This lies far in the past.2. The passage or progress of the individual man which runs counter to the massadvance; the individual at this stage proceeds clockwise from Aries to Taurus,via Pisces . His life is then and for long ages predominantly anti-social in thespiritual sense; he is selfish and self-centred. His efforts are for himself andfor his own satisfaction and personality enterprises, and this becomes steadilystronger and stronger. This is the present situation for the masses.3. The passage or progress of the re-oriented man from Aries to Pisces, viaTaurus . In this final stage, he returns to the same directed method, rhythm andmeasure of the earlier mass movement but this time with changed and changingattitudes of selfless service, a personality dedicated to the service ofhumanity and with a voluntary re-orientation of his energies so that they aredirected towards the production of synthesis and understanding. [262] This willbe the situation in the future for the masses.The astrologer of the future will have to bear these three modes of progressioncarefully in mind. Such is God's plan as we at present can sense it. In thisplan Virgo, the Virgin, stands for the womb of time and passes thepersonality-soul (Leo-Virgo) through the three above stages or cycles. Shestands also for the womb of form and for the nurturing mother, guarding theChrist principle within her own material substance until in “the fullness oftime” she can give birth to the Christ child. There are three principal signsconnected with the Christ principle in this world period:1. Virgo.—Gestation—governing nine signs from Virgo to Capricorn, includingVirgo.2. Capricorn.—Labour—three signs from Capricorn to Pisces, until the thirdinitiation, including Capricorn.3. Pisces.—Birth—appearance of the world Saviour.In the consideration of these points, another problem for astrology emerges uponwhich I have scarcely touched but which is determining in its results. Theremust be distinction made between the horoscope of the form and the horoscope ofthe inner, living Christ-principle. This will condition the new astrology butwill be developed as astrologers work with the hypotheses which I havepresented. Ponder on these facts connected with the Christ life; they arefamiliar to you theoretically but their implications and their esoteric meaningare abstruse and oft difficult to those who have been reared under the old orderand with the old ideas and approaches to truth. They signify far more than hashitherto been grasped.[263] The rulers of this sign are three in number:1. Mercury.—This is the orthodox ruler. It signifies the versatile energy of theSon of Mind, the soul. It is interchangeable for the Sun (Son) and stands forthe Mediator or intermediary, between the Father and the Mother, between Spiritand Matter, and yet is the result of the union of these two.2. The Moon (Vulcan).—This is the esoteric ruler. The significance of this issimilar to that of the orthodox ruler. The Moon (or fourth ray energy) is hereseen as an expression of first ray energy, manifesting through Vulcan. The Moonrules the form and it is the will of God to manifest through the medium of form.3. Jupiter.—This is the hierarchical ruler and rules the second CreativeHierarchy, that of the Divine Builders of our planetary manifestation. (See thetabulation re the Hierarchies.) This is the seventh Creative Hierarchy as wellas the second, if the five unmanifesting Hierarchies are counted; in thesignificance of two and seven much of the mystery underlying these Hierarchieswill be revealed.Through these three planetary rulers the energies of the fourth ray pour,governing the mind through Mercury and the physical form through the Moon; theenergies of the first ray, expressive of the will of God, begin their control ofthe self-conscious man (unfolded in Leo) and the energies of the second ray,embodying the love of God, pour through into manifestation. Will, love andharmony through conflict—such are the controlling forces which make man what heis and such are the governing and directing energies which use the mind(Mercury), the emotional [264] nature, love (in Jupiter) and the physical body(the Moon, or esoteric will) for purposes of divine expression andmanifestation. It will be obvious to you that the task of Mercury in connectionwith humanity has gone forward most satisfactorily and has brought humanity toits present point of evolution upon the probationary path; that the energy ofVulcan is potently making its presence felt, and hence the struggles going onupon the planet between the men of will—selfish and ambitious—and the men ofgood-will who are desirous of the good of the whole. When the human Hierarchy isfully awakened to spiritual and not simply material possibilities, then the workof Jupiter will immediately intensify and this beneficent ruler will lead thehuman family into the ways of peace and progress.Virgo is definitely related, through the medium of the various planetary rulers,to eight other signs of the zodiac and it is, therefore, with these eight signsthat we are concerned because they produce an inter-related synthesis of ninesigns (including Virgo). In this inter-related numerical synthesis and fruitfulinter-relation lies hid the entire history of human progress and the secret ofthe process of divine manifestation. It is of value here to remember certainpoints which are:1. Nine is the number of man. The fourth Creative Hierarchy is in reality theninth, if the five unmanifested Hierarchies are included in our enumeration. Thehuman Hierarchy is only the fourth among the seven which are in active ormanifested expression.2. Nine is the number of initiation as far as humanity is concerned. There are:a. Five major planetary initiations which a man can take. [265]b. Three systemic initiations of which Christ has two.c. One cosmic initiation which relates a man to Sirius.The relation of Virgo to eight signs has, therefore, a definite bearing on thesematters and the nine united potencies play their part in developing the Christlife in the individual and in the mass of men.From this group of signs and their attendant constellations, three are omitted.These are Leo, Libra and Capricorn. These three signs are all signs of crisisand indicate the progressive influence of the other nine and the situationswhich evolve out of their activity. They are the testing points in the processof the play of energies from the other nine signs as these energies affectindividual aspirants. They are:1. Leo.—The Crisis of Individualisation . This shows itself in two stages as:a. Diffused inchoate power.b. Personality integration.It signifies the emergence of personality and preparation for the Christexperience. It is self-consciousness and the lower synthesis.2. Libra.—The Crisis of Balance. The emergence of the sense of self-directionand equilibrium. It is the point of equilibrium between soul and form. Itsignifies the emergence of free choice. It is consciousness of duality and theeffort to balance the two.3. Capricorn.—The Crisis of Initiation . This exists in five stages andsignifies the emergence of the dominating Christ life. It means the highersynthesis and the control [266] of the Christ consciousness which is groupconsciousness.There are, therefore, nine signs through which potencies pour which are creativein their effect and which produce changes which are needed in the progress ofthe soul towards divine expression. You have also three signs of crisis wherebythe point in evolution is determined. In this connection it should be notedthat:1. Leo-Libra-Capricorn.—Constitute the triangle of the father or will aspect;they mark points of attainment, through crisis met and triumphant achievement.2. Cancer-Virgo-Pisces.—Constitute the triangle of the Mother or matter aspect,conditioned by intelligent activity. They indicate points of opportunity of aninner kind where consciousness is concerned, and therefore you have therecognition of mass, individual and group consciousness.A close study of the above ideas will prove fruitful in establishing methods andrelationships; they should also indicate the key which astrologers can use whenseeking to work with mass horoscopes.As we have studied these various constellations, it will have become apparent toyou that the main function of the planets is to be distributing agents for theenergies emanating from the zodiac as they converge within our solar system andbecome attracted to our planet. Students need to understand more thoroughly thanthey do that the basis of the astrological sciences is the emanation,transmission and reception of energies and their transmutation into forces bythe receiving entity . The energies of the various signs are attracted by thedifferent planets according to their stage [267] of development and by what isesoterically called “ancient relationship” between the informing entities of theplanets and of the constellations. This relation exists between beings and isfounded on a Law of Affinity. It is this law of affinity which produces themagnetic pull and the dynamic response between constellations and planets withinthe solar system and between some particular planet and the forms of life uponanother planet and the “impending energies,” as they are called, which are beingreceived from some major source. The capacity to receive and profit by theplanetary energies (themselves received as emanated from some constellation) isdependent upon the point in evolution which determines the receptivity and theresponsiveness of the mechanism of reception. This constitutes an unalterablelaw and accounts for the power of certain planets which may have hithertoremained undiscovered and which have therefore had little to do with evolutionup to the present, owing to the unresponsiveness of the forms of reception. Theplanets, the energies and forces have existed all the time but have remainedineffective and consequently undiscovered owing to the non-existence of theneeded instruments of response . They will, therefore, have no effect upon thelife and history of an individual and only become potent and “magneticallyinforming” when a man has reached a certain point of development and is becomingsensitive to higher influences and is in preparation for the treading of thepath. This readiness indicates that his response apparatus (the threefoldpersonality) is more sensitive than is the case with the average person, and canrespond to a higher range of vibrations than would otherwise be possible. Hereinalso lies the distinction between the sacred and the non-sacred planets. TheLords of the planets (the ray Lives or planetary Logoi) are also, on Their ownlevel, unequally [268] developed and some of them are further advanced upon thecosmic path of spiritual unfoldment than are others; Those Who are definitelyupon the Cosmic Path of Discipleship are regarded as informing sacred planets,whilst Those Who are upon the Cosmic Probationary Path are expressing Themselvesthrough non-sacred planets. This point I shall later elaborate when we come tothat part of this section in this treatise which is intended to deal with thismatter. The point I seek to make here is that it is all a question of developedreception and sensitivity.Upon the reversed wheel, through the medium of the planetary rulers (orthodoxand esoteric unitedly active), the man upon the path finds himself responsive toa very wide number of energies, coming to him from many angles and directions,and hence the difficulties of the man upon the Path of Discipleship. When hebecomes an initiate, this range of vibrations is rapidly increased and hebecomes receptive to those energies which we have tabulated under the termhierarchical and which have reference to the twelve Creative Hierarchies. Theforces of these Hierarchies (neither planetary nor systemic), then sweep intoand through the initiate and awaken those major group responses which eventuallygive him systemic consciousness and make him a world server in Aquarius and aworld saviour in Pisces. A hint is here conveyed to you anent the world periodinto which we are now entering and it will be increasingly apparent to you (ifyou reflect upon my words) why we are progressing into a sign wherein the ranksof initiates will be greatly augmented. In the stage of initiation, the energiesof the signs and their constellations (shall I say attendant constellations—itexpresses the situation more accurately than the usual mode of saying it) comethrough in a purer form and in a more direct line than upon [269] the Path ofDiscipleship and the earlier stages of evolutionary development. The initiate isresponsive to planetary, systemic and certain cosmic influences and becomes—if Imight so express it—a lens through which “the many lights which are energyitself” can stream and thus be focussed upon our planet. To these energies, theinitiate tunes his consciousness and thus becomes a planetary server.The other point upon which I might here touch is that certain of the raysexpress themselves through two planets. For instance, the fourth Ray of Harmonythrough Conflict reaches us both through the Moon and through Mercury, whilstthe first Ray of Will or Power reaches us through Vulcan and through Pluto. Thereal reason for this is one of the secrets of initiation and is hidden in thedestiny of the fourth Creative Hierarchy and in the will-to-manifest of the Lordof our Earth, Who is Himself upon the third Ray of Active Intelligence; of Himit is said that “when the third great energy is related to the fourth CreativeHierarchy, the mystery of the perfected Seven will be understood.” One of themore obvious of the significances of this statement is to be found in theunfoldment of intelligence and love in the initiate, at which time of manifestedexpression and at the last major initiation, he will be responsive to thesynthesis of energies which emanate from the “seven spirits before the throne ofGod.” These are the representatives of the seven Rishis of the Great Bear andTheir other pole, the seven Sisters of the Pleiades, symbolically recognised asthe seven wives of the Rishis of the Great Bear. Here again, in relation to oursolar system, do we find another great triangle of energies, of which the focalpoints on our Earth are the seven Spirits before the Throne. With this trianglewe shall later deal; I simply want to refer to it here: [270]1. The seven Spirits responsive to the seven sacred planets. They are:a. Expressions of divine life upon the Earth.b. Focal points for the Lords of the seven rays.c. Rulers of the seven planes of consciousness and manifestation.d. Representatives because responsive to2. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear Who are:a. Expressions of the life of the One About whom Naught May Be Said.b. The positive focal points for the seven major cosmic energies.c. Rulers of the seven Creative Hierarchies.d. Related as positive poles to3. The seven Sisters or the seven Pleiades who:a. Are expressions of the dualism of manifestation in their relation to theseven Rishis.b. Provide the negative pole to the positive aspect of the seven Rishis.c. Fuse with the positive energies of the Great Bear and, unitedly, work throughseven of the zodiacal signs.Here again the complexity of the forces playing upon our planet and increasingin their number and their potency as the vehicles of response upon our planetbecome more highly developed and sensitive and are, therefore, capable of atruer reaction and a more rapid response to the many forces impinging upon ourplanetary forms of life. It has been remarked by a profound astrological expertWho [271] works with the Masters of the Great White Lodge that “when humanitycomprehends the distinction between the signs and the constellations,understands the nature of the polarity of energies and responds to the threecosmic Realities, the twelve cosmic Energies and the seven planetary Impacts andthe interplay of the twelve Creative Hierarchies, then and not till then, will aradiant light be seen and the destiny of our solar Logos be finally determined.”Behind this statement are to be found three meanings: one for averageintelligent man, another for disciples, and a third one for initiates above thethird degree.As I earlier pointed out to you, the sign Virgo is related to nineconstellations and in this fact lies both prophecy and guarantee. That whichthis sign veils and hides is potentially responsive to nine streams of energywhich—playing upon the life within the form and evoking response from thesoul—produce those “points of crisis” and those “moments of demonstrateddevelopment” to which we have referred in speaking of Leo-Libra-Capricorn.Through Mercury, Virgo comes into close relation to three constellations—Aries,Gemini, and Scorpio. Here again is a triangle of energies of great importance inthe life of the Christ-child which Virgo guards and nourishes and hides withinherself. Through Aries and Scorpio, the Christ-life and manifestation isintegrated with that of the fourth Creative Hierarchy; herein lies a greatmystery which is concerned with the dual manifestation of the Christ principleboth in form and—upon its own plane—through spiritual manifestation; it is herealso that the true significance of the words found in The Bhagavad Gita appearswhen Krishna (the Christ principle) says to Arjuna (the world disciple, ordeveloped form aspect): “Having pervaded the entire universe with a fragment ofmyself, I remain.” [272] There is here an esoteric reference to the essentialidentity of Son with the Father, the “undying One,” and with the eternal Mother;that is, with spirit and matter. This is the fundamental mystery of Virgo andwill be revealed when the energies pouring into Virgo from Gemini, via theplanet Mercury, have done their destined work; for Gemini is an expression ofthe fourth unmanifested Creative Hierarchy—one of the higher group of Liveswhich stand just beyond the seven Who condition our systemic lives. These Liveshave achieved Their goal, but Their energies are still directed towards andfocussed upon our planet. They are not unmanifested in the case where suchdeveloped planets as Uranus, Jupiter or Saturn are concerned.In this triple relation of three major constellations, one clear understandingcharacteristic can be noted, and that is their essential duality—the effect ofwhich is obvious and so dramatically present in Virgo. Aries sees the beginningor initiation of the relationship between spirit and matter. Gemini isdefinitely a sign of duality and signifies the relation of these two majorenergies in the human or fourth Creative Hierarchy; this dualism is emphasisedin a still more intimate and comprehensible manner in Scorpio , in which thenote of the evolutionary cycle which it dominates is “the Word made Flesh.” Itis the sign wherein the Christ demonstrates His control over matter in the guiseof the triumphant disciple. Spirit and matter (Aries), soul and body (Gemini),the mother and the child (Virgo), the Word and the Flesh (Scorpio)—here are thefour signs of creative dualism and inter-related evolution presented anddescriptive of the potency and objectives of the fourth Creative Hierarchy. WhenMercury, the divine Messenger, the principle of illusion and the expression ofthe active higher mind, has performed his mission and “led humanity into the[273] light” and the Christ-child out of the womb of time and of the flesh intothe light of day and of manifestation, then the task of that great centre wecall humanity will be accomplished. Ponder on this for the significance ofesoteric astrology will emerge more clearly in your minds if you can understandthis fourfold activity of Mercury and the inter-relation of these four signs ofthe zodiac—connected as they are with the logoic Quaternary.It is in this sign also that the Moon in its own right of antiquity and ofancient thoughtform control, and also as veiling both Vulcan and Neptune,connects the force of Virgo with the energies of Taurus, of Cancer and ofAquarius. This is of peculiar importance for it relates the form building aspectwith the consciousness aspect which, at a high stage of development, producesthe manifestation of the Christ principle or Christ-child. It has been saidesoterically that four of the names by which the Christ Avatar is ever calledare:1. The Desire of All Nations Taurus Fixed Cross. 2. He Whom the masses sense orHe Whom they Cancer Cardinal Cross. anticipate 3. He Who is, for Her, thepurpose of existence Virgo Mutable Cross. 4. He Who shows the light and givesthe water Aquarius Fixed Cross.All these signs indicate forms of consciousness, which are conditioned andmanifested by the energies of these signs, performing cyclically and ceaselesslytheir appointed task. They, therefore, are primarily concerned with the stage ofdiscipleship and the manifestation of a solar disciple. Hence the two energieswhich come from the Fixed Cross. This is consequently one of the intermediatecrosses which relate the major three and there are many such.[274] Virgo is related to Taurus through Vulcan which brings in what might becalled the endurance aspect of the will-to-be which carries the incarnated Sonof God through the experiences of the dark time wherein the personality becomesthe Mother in the stage of gestation, through the period of infancy upon thephysical plane and through the stage of adolescence until the initiate attainsfull maturity. This necessitates persistence, endurance and continuity of effortand is one of the characteristics imparted or stimulated by energies pouringfrom Vulcan. You can realise that these are first ray attributes and are thereverse side of those usually emphasised, namely, death or the activity of theDestroyer aspect. Taurus is an expression of the third unmanifested Hierarchyand of this Hierarchy we know nothing beyond the fact that it is concerned withthe light which liberates from death. Therefore, you have:Taurus—Illumination.Vulcan—First ray or endurance.Third Creative Hierarchy—Liberating Light.Virgo—The Christ-life, latent and unexpressed (as is the 3rd CreativeHierarchy).The Moon—The form nature, the substance of the flame which lights the way.A vast field of psychological research in connection with all theconstellations, the planets and Hierarchies is indicated above, but it is of toovast a nature for me to consider in this treatise. It will constitute theastrology of the future and will begin to be understood when group awareness andcontinuity of consciousness are established among men. However, as a form ofmental gymnastics and as indicating possibilities, the concept is of use to you,for it widens your [275] horizon and indicates the marvellous scope of thedivine plan and the synthesis underlying manifestation.Neptune is as you know, the God of the waters, and the term “water” covers manyangles of the esoteric wisdom, such as:1. The whole concept of matter—universal and itemised.2. The “waters of substance.”3. The ocean of life.4. The world of astral glamour and reaction.5. The astral plane as a whole.6. The desire and the emotional nature.7. The world of focussed incarnation for the masses.8. Mass existence, as in Cancer.Of all these attributes or conditions of the feminine pole in existence (thematerial aspect), the constellation Cancer is outstandingly symbolic. Itprecedes Leo, the sign of individuality and of self-conscious effort, and isconcerned with the slow rhythm of mass life—either instinctually active or thereactions of an imposed consciousness which is a result of chosen experienceafter initiation. It connotes mass life, leading to group life after theexperience of initiation, for which its polar opposite, Capricorn, stands andwhich finds full expression in Aquarius which completes the experience of Leoand fuses it with that of Cancer and Capricorn. These six signs:Cancer . . . . . . . . . .Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . .VirgoCapricorn . . . . . . . .Aquarius . . . . . . . . Piscesform another six-pointed star of profound significance which is the subjectivecounterpart of the six-pointed star (the interlaced triangles) which we callKing Solomon's seal. This interlacing of the two above triangles constituteswhat [276] is called a triangle of humanity and—under the theories of theScience of Triangles—it concerns the relation of the individual to the mass ofhumanity and of the disciple to the group. These triangles warrant most carefulstudy. It is the planet Neptune which is predominantly active in bringing aboutsuch an activity in Cancer that adequate momentum can be set up which willproduce progress (through the intervening signs) to Aquarius.I would like here to add something more to the teaching about the wheel of lifeand its reversed motion which occurs at a particular stage of evolution. I wantto call your attention to the fact that the difficulty of the problem and theintensification of the life of conscious duality which marks the earlier stagesof the Path of Discipleship, up to and immediately preceding the thirdinitiation, is based upon the wheel of the zodiac contributing its influences tothe life of the form nature in a normal manner; the myriads of lives whichconstitute the form are conditioned by the signs of the zodiac proceeding in itsnormal manner—clockwise, due to the precession of the equinoxes, whilst the lifeof the disciple, focussed in the soul consciousness, is governed (or should Iremark, should be governed?) by the wheel, proceeding anti-clockwise. Bothmotions are in potent opposition and, symbolically speaking, produce eventuallythat “tearing asunder” which always precedes initiation and illumination andwhich is testified to by all the mystics and initiates. This is in reality thatwhich produces the destruction of the veil of illusion and is symbolicallyreferred to in The New Testament as “the veil of the temple was rent in twainfrom the top to the bottom.” This constitutes the result of the dual activity ofthe Great Wheel. It precedes the dark night of the soul wherein the man standspendant between heaven and earth and then cries: [277]“Where is the one God Who has forsaken me? He is nowhere to be seen and allother gods have gone. I stand alone, bereft yet unafraid. I see the dark ofform; I see the dark of distant spirit. And all the light of soul seems gone.”Then comes the cry triumphant: “I know I am the Light of God. There is naughtelse.”Through the Moon and also through Jupiter, Virgo is brought into relationshipwith Aquarius which means, in this case, with the seventh Creative Hierarchy, orwith the atomic substance out of which the dense body of manifestation has to beconstructed if the Christ life (which the Virgin nurtures) is to be brought tosuccessful manifestation. The cause of manifestation is, esoterically speaking,the stimulation of the “dead lives” (the so-called inorganic substance) intoactivity and into usefulness to the positive Christ life, which is the agent ofthe stimulation. Hence the Moon is the symbol of the response of the dead livesto the outer spiritual impact. The central idea of occultism that even thesmallest atom of substance has in it the germ of that which can respond tospiritual energy is preserved for us in the teaching anent the influence ofJupiter, the second ray agent of the Christ spirit.In connection with Jupiter, as might be expected from a study of the rays, Virgois related both to Sagittarius and to Pisces. This is an exoteric impact butproduces a constant stimulation of the life of the indwelling Christ.Sagittarius rules or conditions (for that is what the word means) the activityof the lunar lords who build the body of man out of their own substance. Itwill, therefore, be obvious to you why, when a man begins the one-pointedactivity of Sagittarius and becomes the earnest disciple, it [278] is possiblefor him to rule his personality and to govern it so that eventually it becomesthe vehicle of the soul. It accounts also for the reaction of the personalityagainst this control. It is because of facts such as these that astrology isbound to become one of the major sciences of the future, and when this is so thecontrol of the personality will be scientifically carried forward; full use willbe made of the planetary influences and the energies coming from the signs asthey cyclically make their appearance, and special effort will be made, forinstance, to gain certain aspects of control during the month in which the Sunis in the sign Sagittarius.The relation existing between Virgo and Pisces (between the Virgin Mother andthe Fish Goddesses) is well known, for they are polar opposites and theirfunctions are interchangeable in a peculiar manner. In the revolution of theordinary wheel, Aries and Scorpio mark the beginning and the end, and consummatein the rounded out and equipped personality. They are, exoterically, Alpha andOmega. In the life of the disciple, Virgo and Pisces stand in the same relation.Pisces consummates the work carried forward in this major world cycle. Some ideaof the creative story above indicated can be gained if the tabulation of thenine constellations with their signs is studied.1. Aries . . . . . . . . . . . . . Beginning . . . . . . . . . . .

Mutable Cross. 9. VIRGO . . . . . . . . . . . . . THE MOTHER . . . . . . . . .MUTABLE CROSS.One point of interest emerges: All the four arms of the Mutable Cross arerepresented in this interrelation, indicating [279] the completed activity ofthe Mutable Cross or of the preparatory stage of evolution which hassuccessfully prepared the man for mounting the Fixed Cross. The personality isprepared to be the mother of the Christ.If we consider the two solar systems (the past and the present) as a unity, itmight be said that:1. The Mutable Cross governed the first solar system. In that system and in thissolar system, and to humanity en masse, this Cross rules or governs the path ofprobation (which in reality is the entire life experience, prior to treading thepath of discipleship).2. The Fixed Cross governs the present solar system and corresponds to the pathof discipleship.3. The Cardinal Cross will govern and rule the next solar system and in thissystem governs the path of initiation, which is trodden by the flower of therace.The fact that all four energies of the Mutable Cross, three of the Fixed Crossand two of the Cardinal Cross pour into the sign Virgo in relative degrees andpotencies indicates the fundamental importance of this “sign of reception” as itis called. All nine energies are required to bring a man to the point where theworld and influence of the two solar systems have done their task in:1. Preparing the vehicle of reception and protection, which is the personality,the form, the self-conscious man.2. Bringing into manifestation thereby the hidden man of the heart, the Christwithin, the soul, the group conscious man.What will be the objective and the consummation of the activity of the CardinalCross during the next solar system [280] is hidden in the revelation which comesto the man who has taken the third initiation. It is connected naturally withthe Spirit or first aspect of divinity, or with the Monad and with theexpression of the divine consciousness. Until a man has, however, taken thisinitiation, he profits not from anything that I could tell him in thisconnection. For its impartation also, words are useless and in fact do notexist.As I have told you, Virgo is regarded by the esoteric teachers of the Hierarchyto be identified with the third aspect of divinity, with the mother principleand is believed to be the director of the energies, developed and recognised inthe first solar system. It is for this reason in this solar system that Virgo issubjected predominantly to the influence of the second, fourth and sixth rayenergies through Jupiter (second ray) the Moon and Mercury (fourth ray) andNeptune (sixth ray). The Moon and Mercury together indicate the activity of thehigher and lower mind and are, therefore, related to the third Ray of ActiveIntelligence which controlled the first solar system. There is consequently onlyone planet, Vulcan, which is distinctly and purely first ray energy. These arepoints which advanced astrologers will later elaborate but which at the presenttime mean little.There is another point in connection with the planetary influences which I wouldlike to mention here because it emphasises again the synthetic position of Virgoand its contribution as a major focal point for the distribution of energy tothe fourth Creative Hierarchy. Jupiter rules four signs and each of themrepresents a different element out of the four which are expressing themselvesin the three worlds of human evolution. The following tabulation will make thissomewhat clearer: [281]Virgo Pisces Sagittarius Aquarius Earth Water Fire Air Hidden Christ HiddenSaviour Hidden Master Hidden Server.Jupiter—ruler and the conveyor of EXPANSIONIn this sign, Virgo, the place and the mode of expression of the planets are ofparamount interest, though most esoteric in implication and most difficult tounderstand.Mercury is exalted in this sign because the mother is necessarily ruled by herson, the Son of Mind who is also the Son of God. Of this son, she is theprotector and is responsible for his development and slowly acquired experience.Mercury, being the Messenger of the Gods and the Agent of Their applied control,is therefore the agent of the third aspect (active intelligence) from one pointof view, and of the second aspect (love-wisdom) from another. He is regarded asembodying in himself both these aspects of the mental principle, the expressionof the concrete and the abstract mind of God. The lower concrete mind wasunfolded in the first solar system and the higher abstract intuitional mind, thepure reason, is unfolding in this system. Mercury is the synthesis ofmanas-buddhi, mind-wisdom which expresses itself through the human soul; Mercuryrules the bridge or the antahkarana. In Virgo, Mercury reaches his full power,for Virgo is intelligence and the hidden Christ is wisdom or pure reason.Venus, pure love-wisdom, falls into generation in this sign and occultly“descends to earth” and stands (as The Secret Doctrine has so carefully pointedout) for the gift of mind and of divinity, embodied in the Son of Mind and thusfor the descent of the Christ principle into generation or into matter. Virgoand Venus are together two aspects of intelligence. The symbolism of the descentof Spirit into [282] the womb of the virgin mother is preserved for us in theastrological fact that Venus falls in this sign; esoterically, she disappearsfrom view and vanishes into the darkness. Neptune, the expression of the sixthRay of Idealistic Devotion, is naturally rendered more impotent in this sign andsimultaneously his “power is lessened,” for the drive and urge of devotion anddesire give place in this powerful sign to the natural processes of formproduction and to the silent activity which is going on within the womb of timeand space.Jupiter, in spite of its latent power, is also “lessened” in influence at thistime because of the second principle or second aspect of divinity, the Son orthe germ of the Christ Who will come, the Son of Mind, descends into the depthsand is temporarily veiled or hidden. I would recommend to the astrologers of thefuture a careful investigation of the falls, exaltations and the diminution ofpower which take place within any zodiacal sign; the whole problem must beviewed in a large manner and not so specifically from the angle of personalityhoroscopes. When the planets are rightly related to the rays which they areexpressing, then the wider theme of the soul's life will emerge; these conditionthe personality but not in the same sense as material circumstance (physicalbody and material environment) condition the mass of men. Ponder on this.In connection with the decanates, I would point out that what I am in thistreatise constantly emphasising is that the astrologer needs to study thehoroscope of an individual from the angle of his place upon the wheel of thezodiac and to consider which way he is going. Is he progressing around the wheelas a personality or is he moving forward as a soul? The conflict to which alldisciples are subjected can be traced to the fact that the form life of thedisciple [283] is influenced in one way by the wheel, and the consciousnessaspect in another way or in the reverse direction. The disciple enters the signunder the influence of that decanate which is for him the first but which is thethird for the ordinary man. This is interestingly and practically instanced bythe constellation which we are now entering. The three decanates of Aquarius,from the angle of the disciple, are Saturn, Mercury and Venus. It is in thissequence that they affect him and carry him forward on his desired way, thusgiving opportunity through conflict, the illumination of the mind and eventuallythe achievement of brotherly love which is wisdom. Ordinarily speaking, the massof men would pass through the sign via Venus, Mercury and Saturn, for theundeveloped man is influenced by those qualities which can be best described asinstinctual mind or affection (Venus), which is brotherly love in embryo; by theslow unfoldment of the mind through the activity of Mercury; finally, as theresult of this unfoldment, conflict supervenes and Saturn offers opportunity tosuffer and, through suffering, to learn to choose rightly, to analyse correctlyand to decide upon the higher values. These points must be carefully consideredby the astrologer. But at this time, we are at a point of crisis and the problemtakes wider implications, for the reason that, for the first time in itshistory, humanity is beginning to mount the Fixed Cross of the disciple, thusreversing its progress upon the circle of the Zodiac. Humanity—as a whole andowing to the large proportion of aspirants and thinking idealists—is enteringAquarius, via the open door of Saturn. At the same time, a very large number ofmen are in the non-thinking instinctual stage and their consciousness ispredominantly Atlantean. These enter via Venus and hence the conflict.[284] According to Sepharial, the three decanates into which Virgo is dividedare governed by the Sun, Venus and Mercury, whilst Alan Leo gives us Mercury,Saturn and Venus. I would remind you here of a point which is oft forgotten byastrologers; this is that, in the case of the disciple, Mercury and the Sun areinterchangeable terms. When the disciple becomes aware that he is himselfMercury, the Son of Mind, and therefore one with the universal Christ, the “Sunand yet the Son of God” (as it is esoterically called), he is then an initiate.Therefore, Leo's assignment of rulers is the truly esoteric one. When thedisciple knows Saturn as the God who offers opportunity and does not only feelhim to be Deity who brings disaster, then he is on the path of discipleship intruth and in deed and not just theoretically. When Venus is the source of wisdomand the expression of the transmutation of the mind into intuition and ofintellect into wisdom, then he is ready for initiation. He is rapidly achievingliberation. The weakness of the rulers of the decanates as given by Sephariallies in the fact that as both Mercury and the Sun are one, the choice istherefore redundant; he omits Saturn and because of this omission, esotericallyspeaking, the “door is not open.”Again, the keynotes of this sign convey their meaning clearly and there is noneed for me to elucidate. On the ordinary wheel, the command goes forth in thefollowing words which institute the activity of Virgo: “And the Word said, LetMatter reign.” Later, upon the wheel of the disciple, the voice emerges from theVirgin Herself and she says: “I am the mother and the child. I, God, I, matteram.”Ponder upon the beauty of this synthesis and teaching and know that you yourselfhave said the first word as the soul, descending into the womb of time and spacein a far [285] and distant past. The time has now come when you can, if you sochoose, proclaim your identity with both divine aspects—matter and Spirit, themother and the Christ.LEO, THE LIONPassing as we are into the Aquarian Age in which the spirit of Aquarius will beexemplified in its universality and its sense of “general distribution,” it isinevitable that a point of crisis should be reached. The true Leo type mustreact in a new and unique manner to the proffered opportunity, and when I saytype, I refer to those people whose sun is in Leo or who have Leo rising. Thereason for this is that Leo is the polar opposite of Aquarius, and the interplayof energies between these two is far more potent than at any previous time inracial history. This is a fact which you are not in a position to verify, but Imake it as a statement of fact. It is because of this fact that you have theappearance of the dictators in different countries at this time, and it isbecause of this fact also that in this present cycle (the ante-chamber of theNew Age) you have the pronounced attitude of these dictators—an attitude whichis so often ignored but which has real racial value. It is the attitude whichleads to a synthesis of the national life, aims and intentions. A typicalinstance of this attitude is that of Hitler. No matter what may be our personalopinion of him, there is no question that he has unified, produced fusion andblended together the various elements in the German race. This activity isAquarian in nature but in its lowest and most undesirable aspect. It is also ofthe nature of Leo, for the people who can produce these results have necessarilyto be intensely self-aware. This is the major characteristic of the Leo person.What [286] part Leo may play in the personal horoscope of Hitler I do not know,for I have not investigated it, but it plays a very prominent part in thehoroscope of his soul.I would suggest to modern astrologers that they cast the horoscopes of thedominant world figures at this time, with the planets which I have given you asthe esoteric rulers; all advanced people and those of major importance are on ornearing the path of discipleship and the influence of the esoteric planets isbecoming, therefore, increasingly powerful. It might prove most illuminating andteach them much. The tendency to fusion, blending, amalgamation, and thespiritual counterpart of this unity is stronger today than heretofore and thetypes which produce this exoterically must have Leo somewhere in a prominentposition in their horoscopes or the Sun controlling in some important house. Ifthe horoscopes do not prove this, it is because the exact hour, moment and dayof birth has not been accurately ascertained.This sign, Leo, is the fifth sign of the zodiac which indicates that it is partof the mysterious number, ten—the number of perfection, a relative perfection,prior to entering into a new cycle of progress. This links Leo consequently withCapricorn, the tenth sign of the zodiac, for it is the processes of initiationwhich make the self-conscious person the group conscious individual. I amchoosing these words with care and fore-thought. Upon the reversed wheel, thisis the eighth sign, the sign of the Christ and of the indwelling Reality; ittherefore marks—in this manner—a new cycle. When self-consciousness is born (asat the moment of individualisation) a new cycle begins. This numericalsignificance links Leo with Scorpio (the eighth sign of the Zodiac) in aneffective manner and you have, therefore, the triangle of Leo-Scorpio-Capricorninvolving [287] humanity and indicating the three important crisis points inman's career:1. Self-consciousness or human awareness. Unity—Leo.2. Consciousness of warring dualities. Discipleship—Scorpio.3. Group consciousness as an initiate. Unity—Capricorn.This sign is a fire sign, and it is the pre-eminent fire sign at this time. TheSons of Mind, the self-conscious Sons of God, are above everything else the Sonsof Fire, for our “God is a consuming Fire.” There is in them that peculiarquality which can burn and destroy and so eradicate all that hinders theiressentially divine expression. I would have you bear in mind the purificatorynature of fire. There are two elements in nature which are connected in thepublic consciousness with the thought of purification—one is water and the otheris fire. It is in this connection that the water signs, Cancer—Scorpio—Pisces,are interesting, and the fire signs, Aries—Leo—Sagittarius, warrant study. Firealways carries forward esoterically that which water has begun.In Cancer , the purificatory waters of experience begin their beneficent work.This is begun upon the Cardinal Cross because that cross deals only with wholesand, therefore, with mass experience.In Scorpio , the purificatory waters of testing and trials are applied. Thistakes place upon the Fixed Cross and their effect is drastic in the extreme.In Pisces , the waters of purification are applied through daily life and theprocesses of incarnation; they apply to the “fish swimming in the waters ofmatter and finding there its sustenance.” This is upon the Mutable Cross of[288] ordinary material existence and experience. Thus the influence of thethree crosses is brought to bear upon the incarnated Son of God upon the wheelof ordinary life and in the usual order. Upon the wheel reversed, the fire takesthe place of water and burns away all dross. Purification of the entire natureis thus achieved gradually, and the man becomes sensitive to the influenceswhich can be brought to bear upon him when the fiery triplicity plays its partand the influence of Aries-Leo-Sagittarius begins to re-orient him towardsuniversality, self-consciousness and one-pointed attitudes. As we go on with ourstudy, the significance of this statement will increasingly appear. I am hintingat matters of spiritual and esoteric importance because this sign, Leo, is ofparamount control in the life of the aspirant. He has to know himself throughtrue self-awareness before he can know that divine spirit which is his true Selfand know also his fellowmen.Leo is a part of the Sphinx, and upon this I need not enlarge as we have touchedupon this elsewhere. This is a great mystery. Virgo and Leo together stand forthe whole man, for the God-man as well as for spirit-matter. It is important tohave this in mind, for when the nature of the world is revealed, then themystery of the Sphinx will no longer exist.The keynotes of this sign are exceedingly well known. They sound out the note ofindividuality and of true self-consciousness. Many people are convinced thatthey are self-conscious when they are only swayed by desire and are orientedtowards the satisfaction of that desire or when they recognise themselves as thedramatic centre of their universe. Yet the only truly self-conscious person isthe man who is aware of purpose, of a self-directed life and of a developed anddefinite life plan and programme. Where [289] these are present, the inferenceis that there is mental perception and some measure of integration. To bemotivated only by emotion and actuated by desire is no indication of trueself-consciousness. In the undeveloped man, it is far more instinctual than isself-awareness. In the truly developed self-conscious man not only is direction,purpose and plan present, but also a consciousness of the active agent of theplan and action. Ponder on this.There are two subsidiary yet potent keynotes of the Leo person upon which Ishould touch at this point if the nature of the influences wielded by Leo are tobe clearly perceived. These are the will-to-illumine, which constitutes thedriving urge towards self-knowledge, self-perception and intellectualpositivity, and also the will-to-rule and to dominate, which is of such acontrolling nature in this sign and such a subtle potency in the Leo type. It isthis will-to-rule which leads a person born in this sign eventually to achieveself-mastery and the control of the personality (for either a good motive or aselfish one), and it is also the same tendency which leads him finally to thecontrol by the personality, ruled by Leo, of groups and large or small bodies ofpeople. This—at an advanced stage—is an expression of the fusion of Leo energyand Aquarian potency. It is inevitable in the long run for men and races; forthis all experience in Leo is preparatory. The will-to-illumine is that whichdrives all Leo people on to experiment and so to gain knowledge; it is thiswhich links them with Taurus, which “carries the fair jewel which gives lightupon its forehead.” In the relationship of Taurus-Leo-Aquarius, you have asignificant and important zodiacal triangle as far as man is concerned and it ispeculiarly significant to the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human Hierarchy.You have, therefore: [290]1. Taurus.—The incentive towards experience in order to gain knowledge.2. Leo.—The expression of experience in order to justify knowledge.3. Aquarius.—The use of experience in order to make the gained knowledge afactor in service.This triangle expresses the life of humanity and it demonstrates finally theperfection or consummation of the human way. Another triangle is of a somewhatsimilar nature, Leo-Virgo-Pisces, but these three produce a still more subtleexpression of consciousness.1. Leo.—The self-conscious man. Personality. Lower unity.2. Virgo.—The latent Christ life or principle. Duality.3. Pisces.—The group conscious soul. The world Saviour. Unity.You will note how consistently the emphasis is laid upon consciousness and itsprogressive unfoldment, and not upon the form or the aggregate of forms whichveil the conscious entity of whatever nature or grade of being. Just as ATreatise on Cosmic Fire endeavoured to give the psychological key to The SecretDoctrine and to interpret the underlying consciousness which the Beings(considered in The Secret Doctrine ) express, so in A Treatise on the Seven Rays, I am carrying on the same idea and, at the same time, seeking to give theneeded key to modern exoteric psychology and also some indications as to theastrological key to The Secret Doctrine to which H.P.B. refers. The Entitiesdealt with in her masterpiece of esoteric truth are here revealed as cosmic,solar and planetary influences evoking—in response to Their outpoured energy orvibratory [291] activity—an awakening of consciousness in the form so that itbecomes aligned to or closely related to Their Own. All revelations appear toemerge into the consciousness of the race in their lowest or most material formbecause the “ascent of knowledge towards wisdom” is always the key to progress,and, therefore, exoteric psychology and exoteric mundane astrology had toprecede the revelation of their significance; the nature of the form had to bemade apparent and man accustomed to it before the meaning behind the form couldbe revealed.You may ask what is the reason for this mode of procedure? I can give you oneamong many which, with a little intuitive reflection, should be convincing toyou. The understanding and the reasoning powers of the soul are complete anddeveloped. But souls—oriented towards incarnation and the will-to-sacrifice—havenot, as yet, the necessary forms in the three worlds which are adequate for theexpression of the knowledge which the soul has on its own plane and level ofawareness. If the inner meanings of the outer symbolic forms of existence wereregistered by an unprepared form (the response apparatus of the soul in thethree worlds and, in the case of man, involving an unprepared and undevelopednervous system, glandular system and brain) the destruction of the form by soulenergy would naturally supervene and a shattering of the lower expression wouldtake place. It is here that the significance and purpose of time can be notedand intelligently employed, but this involves a most definite development of theesoteric sense. There are other reasons, but this one will suffice. In theevolutionary process there is, therefore, first the form, gradually prepared,adjusted, aligned and oriented during many aeons of time; behind this activeform, as it steadily improves and becomes more responsive to environment and[292] contact, stands the slowly awakening consciousness. This is the thinking,intuiting, loving soul, which tightens its hold over its response apparatus,avails itself upon every possible occasion of every advance made by the form,and employs every influence for the perfecting of the great work which itundertook under the Law of Sacrifice.It is for this reason that I have not attempted in this Treatise toprove—scientifically and in the modern exoteric sense—the natural response tothe inner psychological factors and to the esoteric astrological influences.These can be easily demonstrated and instantly made apparent once modern scienceaccepts the occult premises, even if only in an experimental and hypotheticalmanner. I am confining myself entirely to the theme of the unfoldment ofconsciousness, of meaning and of significances and of the response of thisconscious entity to the many influences and vibratory impacts to which it issubjected on account of its being an integral part of other and greater Lives.Ponder on this. This is my frequent injunction, given because the activity ofreflection is a potent means to revelation.I have sought to bring the above thoughts to your attention because the sign weare now studying is one in which the theme of self-consciousness lies open tothe investigator. Mass consciousness in Cancer gives place to individualconsciousness in Leo. Out of the mass or the herd emerges the self-sufficientunit which becomes increasingly aware of its oneness, its aloneness and itsisolated attitude as the “one in the centre” of its small cosmos. This attitudecontinues to develop and to become emphatic and dynamic (I use these words withintent), leading to the pronounced ego-centric consciousness of the selfish,intelligent man and to the ambitious display of selfish power of the man whodesires place and position. But eventually the time comes [293] when the natureof the Fixed Cross begins to dawn upon the consciousness of the man and theinfluence of Aquarius (the polar opposite of Leo) begins to balance that of Leo.Then there comes the gradual shift of the focus of attention away from the “onewho stands alone” to the environing group, and an equally important shift awayfrom selfish interests to group requirements. This gives concisely the objectivewhich is attained by the man upon the Fixed Cross; the effect of that Cross isto bring light and liberation. This can be clearly seen if we contrast theenergies of the four arms of the Cross as they are demonstrated by the man bothbefore and after the long and drastic experience upon the Cross.1. Taurus.—The Bull of Desire. The light of aspiration and knowledge.2. Leo.—The Lion of Self-assertion. The Light of the Soul.3. Scorpio.—The Agent of Deception. The Light of Liberation.4. Aquarius.—The Chalice of Self-service. The Light of the world.The Fixed Cross is the cross of light. And playing through this Cross all thetime, and emanating from Leo , are the “fires of God”—cosmic, solar andplanetary—producing purification, the intensification of the light and eventualrevelation to the purified man who stands in light. From Aries comes cosmicfire; from Sagittarius comes planetary fire; and from Leo comes solar fire; andeach of these fires “clears the way by burning” for the expression of the threedivine aspects: spirit (Aries), soul (Leo) and body (Sagittarius). Such is thescientific basis for the yoga of fire, applied by the fully self-conscious manto the reflection of [294] the three divine aspects in the three worlds; theseare the three modes of divine expression in these three worlds. Such is thesignificance of the fact that it will be found that before the Door ofInitiation lies the burning ground which all disciples and initiates must tread.The Leo subject treads this burning ground with will and self-effacement. Whenhe has reached full self-consciousness and mental integration and when he hasattained personality effectiveness, then he treads it—undeterred by pain.A little thought will make it apparent to you why the Sun is the ruler of allthe three conditions of Leo—exoteric, esoteric and hierarchical. It is a correctsurmise that the purpose of this solar system is the unfoldment ofconsciousness, and if for the strictly human being self-consciousness is thegoal, then the Sun must obviously rule, for it is the source of physicalconsciousness (exoteric and symbolic of the personality), of soul awareness(esoteric), and of spiritual life (hierarchical). I am reiterating the necessityto recognise the stimulation of consciousness as the objective of all theastrological influences because the outstanding theme of Leo is the activity ofthe self-conscious unit in relation to its environment or the development ofsensitive response to surrounding impacts by the one who stands—as the Sunstands—at the centre of its little universe. The whole story and function of Leoand its influences can be summed up in the word “sensitivity,” and thissensitivity can be studied in four stages:1. Sensitivity to conditioning impacts from the environment, i.e., to theimpacts of the world of human evolution, the three worlds or planes, through themedium of the three aspects of the response apparatus of the soul;2. Sensitivity to the will, wishes and desires of the personality, [295] theintegrated self-conscious man, the lower self;3. Sensitivity to the soul as the conditioning factor instead of sensitivity tothe environing world as the conditioning factor;4. The spiritual sensitivity of the God-Man (the soul and personality fused) tothe environment. At this stage of unfoldment, the liberated man is notconditioned by his environment but begins the arduous task of conditioning it inrelation to the divine plan and purpose and at the same time to cultivatingsensitivity to the higher impacts of those worlds which lead to the final goal.I want you to have this innate spiritual sensitivity and this outer materialsensitivity most carefully in mind if you want truly to understand theinfluences of Leo upon human beings and especially upon the person born in thissign or who has this sign rising, as well as its influences upon the planet.Throughout the universe, it is the soul which is the conscious, sensitive themeof the divine plan—the soul as the anima mundi, or the soul of the world,animating all forms of life below the animal kingdom; the soul as the animalsoul and the extension of this to the bodies of all animals, including the humanphysical body; the soul as the human soul, which is a still further expansion ofthe same sensitive factor but augmented or stimulated by the principle ofself-awareness or of focussed personal sensitivity to all sub-human soulexpression, plus awareness (conscious or unconscious) of the immortal or divinesoul; the soul as the ego or spiritual soul on its own plane—the source ofconsciousness as far as the three worlds of evolution are concerned, and thegoal of all present evolutionary processes.The three aspects of the Sun (as dealt with in The Secret [296] Doctrine ) areof importance at this point, because influences flowing through and from thembring the entire subjective and latent world consciousness to the fore andproduce eventually (at the final revelation and liberation) the full expressionof the consciousness of Deity. This can be called divine sensitivity, theuniversal mind or the divine plan or purpose. Words are inadequate to expressthat of which the highest initiate as yet knows but little. These three aspectsof the Sun are the factors which bring consciousness to the birth and make theultimate goal attainable; they make all forms of consciousness possible becausethese are rooted in the Sun (symbolically speaking) and are an inherent aspectof the greater whole.1. The physical Sun—the anima mundi; the animal soul. Multiplicity.2. The heart of the Sun—the human soul and the divine ego. Duality.3. The central, spiritual Sun—the divine consciousness. The will of the whole.The awareness of God. Unity.As you have been told, the Sun veils certain hidden planets, and in the case ofLeo, the two planets through which the Sun focusses its energy or influences(like a lens) are Neptune and Uranus. The “heart of the Sun” employs Neptune asits agent, whilst the central, spiritual Sun pours its influences throughUranus. The activity of Uranus is, however, only registered at a very advancedstage of development upon the Path and is analogous to that point in theunfoldment of consciousness wherein, by an act of the will, the conscious andillumined man (focussed in the highest head centre) arouses the centre at thebase of the spine and draws the kundalini fire upwards. Making a broad andconsequently [297] somewhat inaccurate generalisation, it might be said thatthis process is followed upon the three Crosses:1. Upon the Mutable Cross , it is the physical Sun and its influences whichaffect the man, stimulate the bodily cells and sustain the form nature,affecting the centres below the diaphragm.2. Upon the Fixed Cross , it is the “heart of the Sun” which is called intoactivity and which pours its energies through Neptune upon man. These stimulateand affect the heart, the throat and the ajna centres.3. Upon the Cardinal Cross , it is the central, spiritual Sun which is calledinto play, and Uranus is then the distributing agency and the head centrebecomes the centre in the initiate's body through which direction and controlcome.In connection with the Mutable Cross, the rays of the Sun in a threefold form(combining the lowest energies of the threefold Sun) pour into and through theman, via Jupiter. Jupiter is the agent of the second ray which the Sunexpresses—cosmically and systemically.Hence the triple relation of the Sun to Leo which is unique in our solar system,and hence the importance of the triangle which controls the man born underLeo—the Sun, Uranus and Neptune. The energy of Leo is focussed through the Sun,and is distributed to our planet via the Sun and the two planets which it veils.Neptune, being the sign of the Deity of the waters, is related to the sixth raywhich governs the astral or emotional plane of desire. When Neptune is thusactive in the advanced Leo subject, then emotion-desire have been transmutedinto love-aspiration and are dedicated to and oriented [298] to the soul; theentire emotional or sensitive nature is responsive to energies coming from “theheart of the Sun,” and when this is the case, it indicates that the disciple isnow ready for the second initiation. This orientation is brought about by whatis called “the sublimination of the influence of the Moon” which is, as youknow, the mother, symbolically speaking, of the form nature and reflects theSun, or the Father aspect. The above statement is exceedingly occult in itssignificance. Esoterically speaking, you have the emergence of an interestingtriangle of force which affects the Leo subject—the Sun, the Moon and Neptune;these are an expression of Rays 2.4.6 and, where these three are dominantlyactive, you have the establishing of that “inner alignment and attitude whichforces open the Door into the Holy Place.” I use these old phrases here becausethey express concisely what it would take many pages to elucidate and becausethey have that note of esoteric stimulation which awakens, in the disciple, thepower of abstract thought.In connection with the horoscope of the Leo subject and the theme of initiation,I would point out that when the Sun, the Moon (hiding a planet) and Saturn areall combined in a certain house in the horoscope you have what is called the“sign” of the man who is to take initiation. Leo, being the fifth sign of thezodiac, counting from Aries via Taurus, and also the eighth sign, counting fromAries via Pisces, is closely connected through numerical affinity with Mercury,who is esoterically called “the Messenger at the eighth gate”; Mercury wasactive at the time of individualisation when the “eighth gate” was opened and amajor initiation of our planetary Logos took place, producing, in the humankingdom, the process of individualisation.From another angle, as might be anticipated, Leo is related [299] to Scorpio,whose numbers upon the zodiacal wheel are the same as those of Leo, being fiveand eight. You have, therefore, the formation of the triangle to which I earlierreferred: Leo-Scorpio, leading to initiation in Capricorn.As we are upon the subject, one other point might be touched upon here. August,which is ruled by Leo, is the month of the Dog-star, or of Sirius, which thusbrings Sirius into close relation to Leo. Leo, in the cosmic sense (and apartfrom our solar system altogether) is ruled by Sirius. Sirius is the home of thatgreater Lodge to which our fifth initiation admits a man and to which it bringshim, as a humble disciple. Later, when the new world religion is founded and isworking, we shall find that the major, monthly festival in August, held at thetime of the full moon, will be dedicated to the task of making contact, via theHierarchy, with Sirian force. Each of the months of the year will later bededicated (through accurate astrological and astronomical knowledge) towhichever constellation in the heavens governs a particular month, as Siriusgoverns Leo. This I shall later elaborate in the papers to be written anent thenew “Approaches” to spiritual reality.Mercury again comes, at this point, into our discussion, and you thus have theformation of an esoteric quaternary, affecting powerfully the major quaternaryof man—spirit, soul, mind and brain. This energy brings about an inter-relationand an inner awakening which prepares the aspirant for initiation. This higherquaternary is Sirius-Leo-Mercury-Saturn. You have, therefore:Sirius Leo Mercury Saturn Spirit . . . . . . . . . Soul . . . . . . . . . . Mind. . . . . . . . . Brain. Life . . . . . . . . . . Quality . . . . . . . .Illumination . . . . Appearance. Inhalation . . . . . . Interlude . . . . . . .Exhalation . . . . . Interlude.[300] The above tabulation gives you the clue to the basic reality and necessityof meditation as practised by the disciple and the initiate. This may not beapparent to you at first sight and I may not further expand these suggestions,but the directed reflection of the illumined mind may bring insight to you intime. The influence of Sirius is not consciously felt until after the thirdinitiation when the true nature of the spirit aspect begins to dawn upon theliberated, intuitive perception of the initiate. For the advanced initiate inthis sign, and after the third initiation, Sirius becomes a major life factor.He begins to respond to its vibration because he now rules the Sun and the Moonand is controlling those two planets, for that is what the Sun and the Moon havebecome to him—simply planets to be ruled. This is a great mystery and I simplystate the fact. Sirius, Leo, the Sun, the Moon and Mercury are now theinfluences with which the initiate is concerned. The influences of Sirius, threein number, are focussed in Regulus, which is, as you know, a star of the firstmagnitude and which is frequently called “the heart of the Lion.” There is morereal occultism hidden in the names given to the various stars by astronomersdown the ages than has yet been realised, and here you have a case in point.It will be apparent to you (given a little thought) that the Sun, as it veilsNeptune, produces a potent effect upon the personality, symbolised for us hereby the astral body, whilst Uranus (which is also veiled by the Sun) symbolisesthe effect of the soul upon the personality. Hence the activity of the seventhray, which is—from one angle—the lowest aspect of the first ray. Hence you havealso the underlying idea of: [301]1. The awakening of the personality to soul control and contact, with a trueexpression eventually, in the three worlds, of soul-will, desire and intent.2. The awakening of the seventh centre, the centre at the base of the spine, bythe soul working through the first or highest head centre and producing (as aconsequence) the surging upwards of the kundalini fire. This, in its turn,produces fusion with the higher forces. When this takes place the three majorcentres in the body areThe Head The Heart The base of Spine Central spiritual Sun . . . . The heart ofthe Sun . . . . . . The physical Sun. Sirius . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Mercury . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Saturn. The Sun . . . . . . . . . . . . .. Uranus . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Neptune.As the above alignment corresponds to a very high stage of initiation, it willnot be possible to grasp all the implications, but enough may be apparent toreveal the underlying theme and purpose of the great work.Several major triangles of force were active when individualisation took placeand the “Lions, the divine and tawny orange Flames” came into being and thushumanity arrived upon the planet. I would touch here briefly upon one triangle:The Sun (second ray), Jupiter (second ray) and Venus (fifth ray). It will beapparent to you that we here have another sphere of influence of majorimportance, governed by Leo. It is a triangle to which H.P.B. refers in TheSecret Doctrine , the influence of which she was endeavouring to elucidate. Sopotent was the influence of this triangle that its effect upon the Moon was todenude her of life by drawing out all the “seeds of life,” thus destroying herinfluence, for it was undesirable where humanity was concerned.[302] Through Uranus, Leo is related to three other signs of the zodiac: Aries,Libra and Aquarius, and these three constellations, with Leo, form what has beencalled “the subjective quaternary of the reincarnating soul” because they arerelated to the permanent atoms which persist from life to life and whichform—during the cycle of reincarnation—the repositories or the storing houses ofthe experiences undergone during life in the three worlds.1. Aries —is connected with soul intention, the vibratory activity of which(under impulse from the Monad) initiates the successive involutionary periodswhich produce appearance upon the physical plane.2. Libra —is related to the mental unit and, as we saw when studying the signLibra, produces eventually a balance between the pairs of opposites. This isbrought about upon the astral plane. It is the attainment of this balance whichproduces the reversal of the mode of passing around the zodiacal wheel and ittakes place when integration has occurred, and the man is focussed upon themental plane. He can, then, through right use of the mind, discriminate betweenthe pairs of opposites and find the narrow razor-edged path which passes betweenthem and keep his balance upon it.3. Leo —is connected with the astral permanent atom, for the reason that desireor the power to go forth and occultly touch that which is desired is the basisof all sense of awareness or responsiveness and the underlying cause of progressor evolutionary movement forward; it is the keynote of the man who has achievedthat true “self-centred” attitude which makes him an individual. Later, asresponsiveness grows and the world of small affairs is converted into the worldof ever larger [303] values and reality, the desires change into aspiration andfinally into spiritual will, purpose and intent.4. Aquarius —is eventually connected with the physical permanent atom which is,as you know, upon the etheric level. It is this individual web which is themedium of relationship to the whole. The universal consciousness of Aquariusbecomes expressive just in so far as the individual etheric body is in consciousrelation with the etheric body of humanity, the solar system and—of course—theplanet.I would here point out that the term “permanent atom” is essentially symbolicand that what we call the permanent atom is in reality only a unit of energywithin the sphere of influence of the soul ray which can at any time “pick itup” (if I may use so un-euphonious a phrase). In these atoms the past memory ofthe personal self is stored; these are in the nature of “memory cells” and arethe repositories of past experience, of gained quality, and of the particularnote which the body of which it is the nucleus has achieved. They are materialin nature, are connected only with the form aspect, and are imbued with as muchof the quality of consciousness as the soul has succeeded in developing in thethree worlds. The whole subject is most abstruse and will be only understood,and the symbolism involved rightly interpreted, when clairvoyance is a normalattribute of average man. Then the focus of the substance in any form (itsgalvanising centre) can be seen. I do not here advise much reflection on thesubject, as it is an exceedingly difficult one, constituting, in itself, a veryadvanced science, and embodying the mystery of the first solar system, thepast—again the memory cells give their contribution. It is through the permanentatoms that the Forces of Materialism can [304] work; the Great White Lodge worksthrough the seven centres.Aries begins the process and is the “initiator of the process which leads toprogress” and—at the end of the age (as it is now at the final or seventhinitiation)—the Initiator of the Mysteries will work under instructions and withenergies which emanate from the Lord of the Constellation Aries. In the lastanalysis and esoterically speaking, fire is the great liberator and Aries is theleading fire sign which will eventually “fuse the beginning and the end, blendthe opposites and dispel both time and space.” At present, the Initiator of theMysteries acts under inspiration and with energies emanating from Capricorn—anearth sign—because humanity is, as yet, earth-bound. The forces of initiationproduce their major effects upon the physical plane, for it is there that theinitiate has to demonstrate his liberation, his understanding and his divinity.Because of its position upon the Fixed Cross, Leo comes under the influence,direct or indirect, of six planets: The Sun; Neptune; Uranus; Jupiter; Venus;Mars. All of these are potent in expression in this sign, achieving a determinedpoint of revelation and producing, through their united activity and interplay,the six-pointed star of humanity. They condition the man's consciousness but notevents, except in so far as his consciousness assumes control at a certain pointin his evolution. Connected with the esoteric science of astrology aresubsidiary sciences, such as the Science of Triangles, to which I havefrequently referred; there is also the Science of Relationship, which concernsthe relations between the many quaternaries which can be discovered in theplanetary interrelation, the relation between four constellations, plus manyhuman and divine quaternaries. There is again the Science of Stars of Energy,[305] such as I have here noted when referring to the six-pointed star ofhumanity, and of this Science King Solomon's Seal is the well known symbol.These stars, triangles and squares are found in all horoscopes—human, planetary,systemic and cosmic—and constitute the life pattern of the particular Beingunder investigation; they determine the time of manifestation and the nature ofthe emanations and influences.The squares or quaternaries relate to material appearance or form expression;the stars concern the states of consciousness, and the triangles are related tospirit and to synthesis. In the archives of the esoteric astrologers connectedwith the Hierarchy, charts are kept of those members of the human family whohave achieved adeptship and upwards. They are composed of superimposed squares,stars and triangles, contained within the zodiacal wheel and mounted upon thesymbol of the Cardinal Cross. The squares, having each of their four angles andpoints in one or other of four zodiacal constellations, are depicted in black;the five-pointed star is depicted yellow or golden colour and its five pointsare in contact with five of the constellations on the great wheel; the trianglesare in blue and have, above each point of the triangle, an esoteric symbol,standing for the constellations of the Great Bear, Sirius and the Pleiades.These symbols may not here be revealed but indicate the point of spiritualconsciousness achieved and the responsiveness of the initiate to these majorcosmic influences. A glance at these geometrical charts will indicate in amoment the status of the initiate, and also the point towards which he isstriving. These charts are fourth dimensional in nature and not flat surfaces asare our charts. This is an interesting piece of information but of no value,except in so far that it indicates synthesis, the fusion of spirit, soul andbody, and the point of development. It [306] proves also the fact that “Godgeometrises” where the soul is concerned. These charts are most interesting.The relation of Leo to Cancer, through Neptune, has already been touched uponabove and is, of course, easily apparent to you if you have the slightestunderstanding of the consciousness aspect of evolution. There is, first of all,the mass consciousness; then the consciousness of the dramatic, isolated self,and finally again group consciousness, which is, in reality, the highest formsof group consciousness and individual consciousness combined together in theservice of the Plan. Reflect on this definition, for it will stimulate you tounderstanding.The peculiar significance of Leo in the general evolution of consciousness,particularly in the human family, is determined by the control of those twomysterious planets, Uranus and Neptune; in the man who is ready for initiationyou have, therefore, a dual control, i.e., the Sun itself and also the Sun as itveils the influences of these two planets, or rather, as it focusses andtransmits them with intensity. This produces the following developments:1. The Sun—Full self-consciousness. This—through the influence of the physicalSun and the “heart of the Sun”—produces awareness of the relation of the higherself and the lower self. Man becomes aware of his essential duality.2. Uranus—Occult consciousness or that intelligent, fusing condition whichproduces the scientific at-one-ment of the two factors, higher and lower self,through the intelligent use of the mind.3. Neptune—Mystical consciousness or that innate sensitivity which leadsunerringly to the higher vision, to the recognition of the inter-relationinvolved in man's [307] essential duality during the process of manifestation,plus the activity of the mediator.You have, therefore, the conscious, integrated Self, functioning with fulloccult knowledge and also with mystical perception when the influences of Leo,focussed through the Sun, Uranus and Neptune, have been carried adequatelyforward in the life of the advanced disciple. This is one of the reasons why Leois a sign of such paramount importance and why the intelligent Leo subject canusually attain his goal, once he accurately perceives that objective.This sign has frequently been described as the “battlefield of the Forces ofMaterialism and the Forces of Light.” It is occultly regarded as one of the mostmaterial signs, in-as-much as selfish desire for possession of materialobjectives can be peculiarly present and the display of the possessive spiritcan violently control; yet, at the same time, the advanced Leo person canfunction as the “inspired spiritual Sacrifice.” He is then sensitive to worldconditions and freed from personal desires.Before individual man can achieve initiation, he must be fully self-conscious,mystically oriented and occultly developed. He must be aware of himself as heessentially is—a soul involved in form which is itself developed and unfoldedthrough soul activity; he must be a developed mystic, capable of pure vision,motivated by spiritual intent and able to perceive the uses of inherentsensitivity; he must also be a trained occultist, mentally polarised andprofoundly aware of the realities, forces and energies of existence and,therefore, free from the ordinary glamours and illusions which colour thereactions and life of the average man. He is then governed by the physical Sun,motivated by the energies pouring from “the heart of the Sun” (via [308]Neptune) and bringing about at-one-ment through the forces which are reachinghim (via Uranus).Beyond these two distant planets, lies another planet as yet undiscovered,though speculation is rife about it, owing to certain unexplained movements ofthe planet Neptune. It is through this planet that the Forces (as they arerelated to Leo and Aquarius) are focussed in one potent stream of force; thesepour into our planetary life during the month of August, and distributethemselves, via Uranus and Neptune. You have, therefore, in this connection:LEO AND AQUARIUSThe physical Sun Heart of the Sun Central spiritual Sun. / The undiscoveredplanet. / Uranus and Neptune. / The human Hierarchy. / The animal Kingdom.Charts of the cosmic lines of directed forces such as the above can be given forall the energies of the constellations and planetary forces, but this is theonly one I choose, at this time, to indicate, because it is of major importanceto humanity; the others might prove misleading, given man's present point ofintelligent understanding and influence.I would here call to your attention that, through these directing planets, thefollowing rays are controlling factors in the chart of the Leo subject:1. The Sun—2nd ray—love-wisdom.2. Uranus—7th ray—organisation or directed manifestation.3. Neptune—6th ray—idealistic one-pointedness. Devotion to an objective.[309] In the perfected Leo, the loving self-conscious soul (2nd ray) carries itspower of expression straight through from its own plane to the plane of exteriormanifestation, but preserves at the same time its interior control (Uranus) andfrom that point of achievement, proceeds to make its ideal objective (Neptune) afact in consciousness, through sensitivity to the higher vibration and directedintelligent service of the Plan. Ponder on this summation.When Uranus controls, the Leo person is significantly the true observer,detached from the material side of life, but utilising it as he pleases. Hisspiritual consciousness is capable of great expression and he can be (as has oftbeen pointed out by astrologers) both an electric, dynamic leader, a pioneer innew fields of endeavour and also a magnetic centre of a group whether the groupis small, as in a home, or vast as in a nation. He is then polarised above thediaphragm, for the lower more material aspects of life have really no greatappeal to him; he is then profoundly conscious of his own identity, and thismakes him dwell definitely in a state of self-awareness, with its consequentlyabstracting powers. He is instantly aware, once he is spiritually awakened, ofhis motivating impulses, and this leads him to an imposed self-discipline—thething the Leo subject sorely needs and which must always be self-imposed andself-applied for he brooks no disciplinary measures which others may seek toimpose. Discipline imposed by people upon the Leo person leads invariably torevolt and rebellion and the expression of that which the discipline is intendedto eradicate. Discipline imposed by himself leads to the perfection of which heis notably capable. It is this innate ability to control which frequently givesthe Leo subject an apparently negative attitude to life; he inevitably believesthat his destiny is determined and that all that he has to do [310] is simply tobe ; he refuses often then to change or to take action, and when this is carriedtoo far it leads to an unexpectedly futile life. The “lion must emerge from itslair,” and this injunction is badly needed by Leo aspirants. It will, whenfollowed, lead the self-centred Leo consciousness into the decentralised,selfless Aquarian awareness. It will alter the self-service of Leo into thegroup service of its polar opposite, Aquarius. It might appropriately be addedhere that the prayer or voiced aspiration of the true Leo person can beexpressed in the words of Christ, so well known to all of us: “Father, not mywill but thine be done.”I would also call your attention to another interesting fact in connection withthis sign. No planet falls in Leo and no planet is exalted in this sign, whilstthe power of both Uranus and Saturn is somewhat lessened, except in the case ofthe initiate who responds powerfully to the esoteric influence of Uranus. Thesame basic teaching is here conveyed as was taught by the Sun rulingexoterically, esoterically and hierarchically. Leo in its consciousness is thedominant self-aware agent and has therefore the control and can—because ofthis—remain uninfluenced. This fact will be increasingly understood as theadvanced Leo subject makes his appearance. He will be distinguished by hispersonal freedom from outside control. He knows innately that he is king ofhimself, the ruler of his own life and, therefore, no planet is exalted andlikewise no planet falls. The power of the mind, as symbolised by Uranus, islessened, for it is not the mind which in reality controls but the Self, orSoul, using and controlling the mind. The man is not then conditioned by hissurroundings or life events but rules them with deliberation, bringing out ofcircumstances and environment that which he requires. Saturn, therefore, theLord of Karma, has his power lessened in [311] this sign. It is for this reasonthat Sepharial is incorrect when he gives Saturn as the ruler of the firstdecanate. The three decanates are given by him as being ruled by Saturn, Jupiterand Mars. Alan Leo is, however, nearer the truth when he gives us the Sun,Jupiter and Mars.Self-rule through initial conflict, carried to a successful issue and blessed bythe beneficence of Jupiter, is the true history of the advanced Leo aspirant,and this thought and the objective result of this realisation is summed up forus in the two word mottoes of this sign:1. And the Word said: Let other forms exist. I rule because I am.2. I am That and That am I.I Am—the Word of the self-conscious, selfish, individual Leo.I Am That—the Word of the Leo subject who is rapidly gaining the higherconsciousness and preparing for fresh and universal expression in Aquarius.CANCER, THE CRABThis sign is not an easy one for the average student to understand for it is thepolar opposite—psychologically speaking—of the state of group consciousnesstowards which humanity is, at this time, tending. It is difficult for the casualstudent to distinguish accurately between mass consciousness and groupconsciousness. Human beings stand today at a midway point, generally speaking,between these two states of mind, though perhaps it might be more correct to saythat a fairly large minority are becoming group conscious, whilst the majorityare emerging out of the mass conscious stage and becoming self-consciousindividuals. [312] This accounts for much of the present world difficulty andfor the clash of idealisms. The two groups bring a different approach to theworld problems as we now find them. We have, therefore, three signs which (fromthe angle of consciousness) are closely connected yet are widely separate anddifferent in effect.1. Cancer—mass consciousness—instinctual awareness.2. Leo—self consciousness—intelligent awareness.3. Aquarius—group consciousness—intuitional awareness.With much of this we have already dealt and there is no need for repetition aswe study the polar opposites of the signs already considered. I do not intend torefer unduly and in detail to points with which you are already familiar, saveto bring to your attention the beautiful and synthetic unfolding of the divinePlan.This sign is, as you already know, one of the two gates of the zodiac becausethrough it souls pass into outer manifestation and to the appropriation of form,and subsequent identification with it for many long cycles. It is “the gatewhich stands wide open, broad and easy to pass through and yet it leads unto theplace of death and to that long imprisonment which precedes the final revolt.”It is allied with material nature, and with the mother of forms, just as theother gate, Capricorn, is allied with spirit, the father of all that IS.In this sign lies hid the whole problem of the Law of Rebirth. Reincarnation isimplicit in the manifested universe and is a basic and fundamental themeunderlying systemic pulsation. There are certain things which I would like tomake clear in connection with reincarnation.This sign, Cancer, being concerned primarily with the world of causes, has aboutits inner meaning much indefiniteness [313] and an apparently vague subtletywhich proves most elusive to the ordinary thinker. This also is true of all thesigns which go to the forming of the Cardinal Cross of the Heavens. In the lastanalysis, it is only the initiated disciple who can fathom the true meaning ofthese zodiacal influences as they pulsate throughout the manifested universe,because they are primarily the expression of spirit or life more than of soul orbody. Therefore, until after the third initiation—as you have oft beentold—there is little to be known or said about that “mysterious essence which isdivinity in motion.” When you, for instance, read that the keynotes of this signcan be expressed in the Biblical phrase “the Spirit of God moved upon the faceof the waters” does it, in reality, mean anything specific to you? You mightreply by saying that it means, God moved in substance and produced by moving theouter tangible forms. But does that truly convey to you an intelligible truth?In Cancer, God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life and man became aliving soul. In these words, you have established the relation which exists inthe mind of God between spirit (the breath of life) the soul (consciousness) andman (the form). However, does that statement convey an intelligible concept toyour mind? I think not, because the synthesis of the final relation is beyondthe average grasp and its `linking' or essential unity (lying as it does outsideof consciousness and known reality) takes place first of all in this sign—one ofthe most ancient of the signs and one of the first to be recognised andestablished as an influencing factor by ancient humanity.I state a basic truth—vaguely acknowledged by you—that in Aries the essentialsubstance of manifestation awoke to renewed activity under the impact of divinedesire, impelled by the divine Breath, by divine Life or Spirit. In [314] Cancerthis living substance assumed a triple differentiated relationship to which wegive the names of Life (Aries) of Consciousness (Taurus, the next sign to Aries)and manifested duality (Gemini, the sign preceding Cancer) and these three,blended together, came into outer manifestation in Cancer, thus completing anesoteric quaternary of great importance. Here the first major fusion, inchoateand unrealised, took place. In Libra , these reach a point of balance and of asomewhat static equilibrium (later to be disturbed in Scorpio), so that thisessential triplicity appears clearly in relation to each other. In Capricorn ,the sign of initiation, this basic triplicity begins to return to the earlierstate of the “breath of spirit” but, this time, with full awareness and properlyfulfilled organisation, so that form is a perfect expression of the soul and thesoul is sensitive and responsive to the pulsations of the One Life, as that Lifereveals, through its activity, the perfect will of the Logos.The secret (so-called) of the Cardinal Cross is the secret of Life itself, justas that of the Fixed Cross is that of the soul or the mystery of self-consciousentity, whilst the Mutable Cross holds hid the mystery of form. In these words,you have the key to the secret of manifestation as a whole and to that mysterywhich was revealed to Christ at the final crucifixion and to which He testifiedHis understanding reaction in the triumphant utterance recorded in The NewTestament : “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me.” He then left the FixedCross and the Identity which has hitherto been His and identified Himself withthat which was then revealed. To these words, thus translated somewhatinaccurately in the Christian Bible, there are three meanings or truesignificances. The translation hinted at in The Secret Doctrine (S.D. II. 613),[315] “The robe, the robe, the beautiful robe of my strength no longer serves”expresses the inner revelation of the Mutable Cross, as it was revealed to theSaviour, looking at life from the angle of the soul. In the words quoted above“My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me,” the mystery of the Fixed Cross wasshown to Him and the secret of the Cardinal Cross was, for the first time, heldbefore His eyes. The words, embodying that central mystery, have never yet beengiven out. One of the factors which distinguished the Christ from all precedingworld Saviours was the fact that He was the first of our humanity Who, havingachieved divinity (and this many have done), was permitted to see the “goldenthread of light and of living life which links the light within the centre ofall the manifested Crosses”; He was allowed to know the meaning of life as itexpressed itself in the Cosmic Crucifixion, which is an episode of cosmic lifeand not of death, as is generally supposed.Hercules comprehended the true meaning of the Mutable Cross and, with fullknowledge, mounted the Fixed Cross, with all its attendant difficulties andlabours. The Buddha comprehended, through complete illumination, the meaning ofboth the Mutable and the Fixed Crosses, for the secret of revelation in Tauruswas His, just as the secret of directed energy in Scorpio was the source of thestrength of Hercules. But the Christ, knowing both the above secrets, alsounderstood with a living comprehension, the mystery of the Cardinal Cross,because the light of the Transfiguration (undergone in Capricorn) revealed toHim the glory and transcendent mystery.There are two words also which convey the purpose and intent of expression uponthe Cardinal Cross. They give the reason why the two “Doors of the Zodiac” open[316] wide to the impulse and demand of the divine Spirit. One is the word“self-preservation” which leads to the impulse to incarnate in Cancer, which isthe Door to the physical plane expression of spirit. This impulse (when the formis the prime object of the attention of the soul and that with which itprimarily identifies itself) brings about the stage of static concretion in theearth sign Capricorn. The other word is “immortality” which is the divine aspectof self-preservation; it is the major conditioning factor in the creativeprocess and leads to the whole revelation of evolution, to the recurrentappearance of life in form, and to the revelation of life in form. In Capricorn,at the third initiation, this life aspect assumes primary importance.You will see, therefore, why the Cardinal Cross is so mysterious; also why bothCancer and Capricorn are so little understood by modern astrology and why, inthe last analysis, only the initiated Sons of God can grasp the significance ofthe four signs which comprise the Cardinal Cross, or understand the relationwhich exists between the four major divine energies which—pouring through thefour arms of this Cross—produce the vortex of force (a synthetic force) whichconstitutes that “pool of pure, fiery light” through which all those who takethe higher initiations must eventually pass. Those taking the first twoinitiations must tread the Path as it passes through the Burning Ground. Thosetaking the higher initiations have to plunge into the sea or pool of fire whichis essentially the fire of God as it has been cleansed from every aspect of thematerial form through the complete purification of desire.The entire subject of rebirth is but little understood at present. Its modernpresentation and the emphasis which has been laid so strongly on small andunimportant details have distorted and diverted the wide sweep of the subject[317] and ignored the true import of the process; the broad general lines of theincarnation process have been largely overlooked. In the debate as to the lengthof time a man is out of incarnation and in the consideration of foolish items ofunproved and unprovable information, and in the puerile reconstruction of thepast lives of theosophically inclined people (none of them based on any truth),the real truth and the real beauty of the theme have been lost to sight.Cancer is one point of the watery triplicity, and the symbolism which underliesthe three water signs is most interesting in one particular direction. You have,as you know, the Crab, the Scorpion and the Fish Goddesses of the sign Pisces.In ancient Lemuria, the symbol of Pisces was a woman with the tail of a fish,and of this symbol the legendary mermaid is the memory. It was only in lateAtlantean times (when the conscious sense of duality was becoming present in theminds of the advanced humanity of the period) that the woman part of the symbolwas dropped altogether and the two linked fishes took the place of the fishGoddesses. You have, therefore, the Crab, the Scorpion with the sting in itstail and the Fish. The slow moving Crab, identified with its dwelling place andcarrying its house upon its back, lives upon the land (physical plane life) andalso in the sea (the life of the emotions); the Scorpion is rapid in movement,deadly in its effect upon men around it and is a creature of the land; it isalso the symbol of the transformed Crab and the result of the evolutionaryprocess, and indicates the dangerous nature of the man who is not transformedand is therefore harmful and hurtful to others; the Fishes indicate the man fromwhom the symbol of materiality has been taken by the removal of half of theoriginal symbol, thus indicating freedom from matter. The three water signs giveus, therefore, a brief and symbolic [318] history of man's growth and truepersonality development. It is a picture of the law of cause and effect. Thesethoughts you can elaborate for yourself and thus arrive at the evidentimplications.There is also a significant relationship between five signs which are deeplyesoteric in their nature and their effects when swept into this particularinterplay. They are only called into activity during the return half of thewheel of life or the “wheel of living action or of conscious undertaking” as itis called in the Old Commentary . This name is given to the wheel as it turnsanti-clockwise from Aries to Pisces via Taurus. This fivefold relationship isonly established upon the Path of Discipleship and is brought about by theesoteric linking of Cancer-Virgo-Scorpio-Capricorn-Pisces. In the futurehoroscopes of disciples, this significant interplay of forces will be recognisedas dominating the chart at a particular and peculiar stage of discipleship. Inthis case, disciples will be born in one or other of these signs or with one ofother of these signs rising.You have two signs of water and earth (Cancer and Virgo) in the stage ofsub-conscious emphasis wherein everything is latent and hidden. Humanconsciousness is only embryonic in Cancer, for it is the mass mind whichdominates and not the individual mind. In Virgo, the Christ life orconsciousness is hidden and the Christ Child is as yet embryonic in the womb ofmatter and of time, and during this stage, the emphasis is upon the form whichveils and hides the reality. The human soul and the divine soul (the essentialduality) are there but their presence is not easily detected. In Scorpio comes apoint of transition, of change and of re-orientation. That which has beenhitherto hidden appears and is brought to the surface by means of theexperience, the tests, the trials and the “sting of life.” In Capricorn—[319] asa result of the effects of the influences of Cancer, Virgo and Scorpio—thedisciple begins to demonstrate the capacity to express the life of two kingdoms,at least in some measure, and is a developed human being and also a citizen ofthe kingdom of God. Therefore, for an initiate and for a period of threeincarnations, the four signs of revelation (Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio andCapricorn) intensify their effect upon him, until in the fourth incarnation hebegins to respond to the inner influence of Pisces. He thus demonstrates hisability to react to the Shamballa influence and, when this influence isestablished, he goes out to salvage and to save. He acts consciously as a worldmediator. Therefore, it might be stated that:1. In Cancer , the influence of the human Hierarchy begins to make its presencefelt and to include the dualism of man. This emerges clearly in Virgo. Soul andbody are closely related and knit together in one form. Man is a consciouspersonality, and this is a result of the Cancer experience, consummated inVirgo.Such is the way of humanity. The human centre is active.2. In Scorpio , the influence of the occult Hierarchy begins to set its seal onthe human being, and his essential duality is put to the test. This ispreparatory to a new and higher unity. He is at the miserable stage of beingneither the soul nor the form—the stage of transition.Such is the way of the disciple. The hierarchical centre is affecting himpowerfully.3. In Pisces , the influence of Shamballa claims the initiate as its field ofactivity and the dualism of soul and spirit emerges instead of that of soul andbody which has hitherto been of major importance. The power of the [320] form tohold the soul in captivity has been negated and tests and trials of the initiateup to the third initiation are directed to this end.Such is the way of the initiate.You will note the interesting fact that you have here nine signs which carry aman from the stage of imprisonment in form to the freedom of the kingdom of God,from the state of embryonic consciousness to the full flower of divineknowledge, from the condition of human awareness to the conscious wisdom of theinitiated disciple. These nine signs are strictly expressive of humanunfoldment—conscious and superconscious, though beginning with the massawareness of Cancer. There are three signs, preceding these, which provide thesubtle or subjective realities of the will-to-be (Aries), the desire-to-know(Taurus) and the establishment of relationship (Gemini), and these constitutethe triple incentive to the manifestation of man and of the human kingdom. Theycorrespond cosmically to the logoic, the monadic and spiritual planes to whichthe higher initiate has access or when dealing with the entire concept on alower turn of the spiral and in connection with ordinary man, they correspond tothe mental, the astral and the etheric vehicles of man. They are, therefore,related to the highest and the lowest expression of human life. I have in theabove ideas given you several hints of vital importance. One of the symbols ofan initiate of a certain degree is that of the five-pointed star with a trianglein the centre; this is a reference to the energy of the watery triangle withwhich we have just been concerned and to the fivefold linking which has beenestablished in the consciousness of the initiate.We come now to a consideration of the rulers of this sign and to a study of theplanets which act as focal points [321] and as distributing agents for certaincosmic energies. Much has been earlier indicated along this line, and a trueunderstanding of the nature of these impacting energies can only be grasped aswe continue with our studies and investigate these signs in the relation whichthey assume as we study them in connection with other signs, claiming the sameplanetary rulers. There is one point which I would like to make clear and thatis that in the two rulers of this sign—the Moon and Neptune—you have the symbolsof a close relationship between the Mother of all Forms and the God of theWaters, that is between the two planets. In this esoteric marriage, you havepictured for humanity a major synthesis of form and of desire-sensitivity and,consequently, a true statement of the stage of consciousness which we callAtlantean. There is much of this today and of this stage, mass sensitivity andmass identification with form and with forms is the significant indication andthe outstanding characteristic of Cancer and its subjects. The Moon, however,relates Cancer to two other signs and these form a cosmic triangle. They areCancer-Virgo-Aquarius. In this combination, you have the sign ofmass-consciousness, the sign of the Christ-consciousness and the sign ofuniversal consciousness very closely related to each other and all of themthrough the medium of the influence of Neptune, which the Moon veils.Like Leo, which is ruled in all its three expressions (orthodox, esoteric andhierarchical) by the Sun, Cancer is the only other sign which is ruled by onlyone planet, though in orthodox astrology, the Moon is substituted for Neptunebecause it is the form nature which is dominant in the longest stage of humanunfoldment, just as esoterically, it is the feeling-sensitive nature whichdominates the average man; it is with this stable tendency that the disciple hasto [322] wrestle. In the mass mind (of which Cancer is the truest expression),it is fortunate that Neptune is veiled by the Moon and that the form fails toregister or step down many of the impacts to which the true man is sensitive.Average humanity is not yet fully equipped to bear the full range of theseimpacts, to handle them constructively or to transmute them and interpret themaccurately. Upon the Path of Discipleship and along the line of esotericdevelopment, one of the major difficulties and great problems of the disciple ishis extreme sensitivity to impacts from every side and his rapid ability torespond to contacts coming from “all points of the compass, from every angle ofthe zodiacal wheel and from that which is within as well as from that which iswithout, from that which lies above, below, and upon every hand,” as the OldCommentary expresses it. It is also as difficult and hard for the averagestudent of modern times to grasp the mass-consciousness of Cancer as it is forhim to grasp the group-awareness or the universal consciousness of Aquarius andto this final development, humanity is hierarchically related by the Moon,veiling Neptune. The average human being is just beginning to grasp the stage ofthe individual Christ consciousness of Virgo to which he is related by the sameplanet.The unveiled Neptune relates Cancer to no other constellation or sign, and thisfact is of very great importance, because it indicates the fact that when a manis an initiate, he does not react to ordinary feeling, sentiment or topersonality relations as they express themselves in pleasure or pain. All theseare surmounted and eventually the watery life of emotional reaction issuperseded by the life of true and of inclusive love. Soul control esoterically“obliterates” the Moon and all traces of Neptunian life. The initiate is nolonger ruled by the Mother of Forms or by the God of [323] the Waters. When the“waters break and are carried away,” the Mother gives birth to the Son and thatindividual spiritual entity then stands free. I would ask you to ponder uponthis point.These two—the Moon and Neptune—are, therefore, the direct influences which arebrought to bear upon the Cancer subject and thus lead to the unfoldment of theform of life and of the emotional-astral body. The supreme usefulness of theseaspects will be grasped if you will intelligently realise that without the formand without the ability to bear in mind the need to respond sensitively to theenvironing conditions and circumstance, the soul would never awaken to knowledgein the three worlds and, therefore, would never know God in manifestation.Indirectly, and via the influences of the Cardinal Cross (of which Cancer is apart), the Cancerian subject is affected by or influenced by five other planets,which are Mars, Mercury, Uranus, Venus and Saturn. The Cancerian subject becomesresponsive to the uses of conflict (Mars), to the functioning of the light ofintuition (Mercury) and to the cosmic pull of Uranus, plus the intellect ofVenus and the presentation of opportunity (Saturn). These, however, playsubjectively upon the dweller in the form and are not consciously registered aspotencies by the individual for many aeons of time and not until the life of theform and the reaction to sensitive emotion-feeling has played an active and aneducational part in the awakening of the mind. Once that awakening of desire andits transmutation into the higher aspiration has taken place, then the Virgoinfluence comes in and the responsive soul—developed by the five indirectinfluences of the Cardinal Cross—begins its active conscious participation inthe drama of life. Thus the direct and the indirect influences of the sevenplanets play their [324] varied parts in man's unfoldment, and students wouldfind it of interest and of value to relate the effects of these seven planetaryforces to the unfolding seven principles of man.Let us now briefly consider for a few minutes the effect of the ray influencesas they focus through the seven planets upon the man born in the sign Cancer.It is here that there will be found certain basic indications as to the natureand the processes of the Law of Rebirth. It would appear that as yet only tworules are posited in connection with the return of an ego to physicalincarnation. The first is that if perfection has not been achieved then the soulmust return and continue the perfecting process upon the Earth. The second isthat the impulse predisposing the ego to such action is some form of unsatisfieddesire. Both these statements are true in part and generic in effect but theyare only partial truths and incident to larger truths which have not yet beensensed or noted accurately by esotericists; they are secondary in nature and areexpressed in terms of the three worlds of human evolution, of personalityintent, and of time-space concepts. Basically, it is not desire which promptsreturn but will and knowledge of the plan. It is not the need for achieving anultimate perfection which goads the ego on to experience in form, for the ego isalready perfect. The main incentive is sacrifice and service to those lesserlives that are dependent upon the higher inspiration (which the spiritual soulcan give) and the determination that they too may attain planetary statusequivalent to that of the sacrificing soul. It is in order eventually to negatethe space-time concept and to prove it an illusion that the door in Cancer opensto the sacrificing, serving soul. Bear this always in mind as you study thesubject of rebirth. In themselves, rebirth and reincarnation are misleading[325] terms and “cyclic impulsion,” “intelligent purposeful repetition” and“conscious in-breathing and out-breathing” would describe more accurately thiscosmic process. It is, however, difficult for you to grasp this idea, for itnecessitates the ability to identify oneself with the One Who thus breathes—theplanetary Logos—and the entire theme must therefore remain relatively obscureuntil initiation has been taken. Esoterically speaking, the point of greatestinterest lies in the fact that it is group rebirth which is taking place all thetime and that the incarnation of the individual is only incidental to thisgreater happening. This has been largely ignored or forgotten because of theintense and selfish interest in personal experience and living, evidenced in thespeculative details anent individual return given in the current so-calledoccult books, most of which are largely inaccurate and certainly unimportant.An intelligent understanding of the Plan is needed before the real truth anentreincarnation can emerge with clarity in the public consciousness. Groups ofsouls come into incarnation cyclically and together in order to further the Planand permit that interplay to proceed between spirit and matter which makesmanifestation possible and which extends the working out of the divine ideas asthey exist in the Mind of God. When the Plan (as the Hierarchy understands it)is more familiar in its objectives and its mode of functioning upon the outerplane of life, we shall see a complete change in the presentation of theteaching concerning the Law of Rebirth. We shall see more clearly the existentsynthesis of:1. The divine plan as it manifests in time.2. The basic relations as they manifest in space.3. The developing effects as they demonstrate in groups. [326]4. The evolving understanding as intellect merges into the intuition.5. The fivefold nature of the logoic expression as it unfolds itself through thefive kingdoms.and this, when correctly intuited, will produce a revelation, and a presentationof this abstruse theme beyond anything at this time sensed by man. It is one ofthe secrets of the first initiation and these secrets are today in process ofexternalisation.It will be found that rebirth is, in truth, a magical and magnetic interplaybetween the form side of life and life itself. This interplay is consciouslyundertaken by the soul which is the product of the two related factors. Theabove statement is, in itself, complex and difficult and far from easy to grasp;it however expresses a significant fact which the Old Commentary phrases asfollows:“Those who are demanding to be saved have cried aloud. Their voices penetrateinto the formless world and there evoke response.“Those who in distant aeons have pledged themselves to save and serve respond.Their cry too rings forth and, ringing, penetrates into the dark and distantplaces within the worlds of form.“And thus a vortex is established and kept alive by that constant dual sound.And then a touch is made and for a space and during time, the two are one—theSaving Souls and the Units to be served.“Slowly the vision of the Saving One becomes a light which guides the CryingOnes into the place of light.”I would suggest to investigators that the entire theme of “cyclic impulse” beapproached from the angle of the group , forgetting, as this is done, theglamour of the personality [327] impress. The sweep of known history will aid inthis, indicating—as it does—the possibility of clarification and the usefulnessof classifying and isolating group activity and character down the ages. Whenthe major reincarnating groups are thus distinguished and their work for thefourth kingdom along many lines is more clearly seen then the whole subject willbe better understood, evoking the play of the intuition. This demonstrates asecond fact of importance, namely that, as yet, it will only be possible totrace the progress of advanced souls in incarnation and not trace, at this time,the cyclic appearing of the unevolved. They are the “material units” which haveto be saved by the more advanced. The theme of service and sacrifice runs,unrecognised, through history. The key to the understanding of thesereincarnating, saving factors lies in a coming intuitive ability to recognisethe reincarnating groups, as groups and not individuals, through their rayqualities, and it was for this purpose that I gave in Destiny of the Nations astatement as to the rays governing certain nations. Groups are governed by theastrological signs and by the rays just as individuals are, and these raysaffect them, via the ruling planets. I have here opened up to you a very widefield of research and I have indicated a most interesting new form of historicalinvestigation and record. The history of the future will be the history of theevolving plans of God as they work out through the serving groups of egos whowill come into physical incarnation under the influence of “divine duality” tocarry forward the development of the lives which constitute the form throughwhich divinity is seeking full expression. The relation of the fourth ray to thefourth kingdom in nature (which is the fourth Creative Hierarchy) is apredetermining influence in all world conflict up to date and is the cause whichhas produced the history [328] of war and conflict down the ages. The theme ofthat ray is “Harmony through Conflict” and it is the lower aspect of the rayenergy, producing conflict which has hitherto controlled, and is climaxing nowthrough the impetus of the new incoming Shamballa force. As it exhausts itself(and this is rapidly coming about) there will be a shift of direction and forceto that major ray, the second Ray of Love-Wisdom, of which the fourth ray is anaspect. This second ray energy is very potently focussed through theconstellation Gemini via the planet, Jupiter. We shall then have theinauguration of a long cycle of beneficent development in which the conflictessential to the interplay between the dualities will be stabilised upon themental plane and—under the influence of the salvaging, serving egos of the fifthkingdom—entirely change world civilisation.It is valuable also to remember that in the studying of the ray forces and theireffects in Cancer, we must do so from the angle of the mass mind and the massreaction and not from that of the individual. This is one of the signs ofsynthesis and of a relative fusion, but it is a fusion on the lower level of thespiral and connotes the fusion of the physical body and the soul but only in theembryonic stage and with the psychic stage still unindividualised. It is thestage of mass reaction to the incoming of the Sons of Light.The entire theme of the zodiac can be approached from the angle of light and itsunfolding and increasing radiance and of the gradual demonstration in what Ihave called elsewhere, “the glory of the One.” The mode of the development ofthis inner light and of its externalisation must remain—from the standpoint ofits cosmic effects—one of the secrets of initiation and this for a long time tocome. It will, however, not be out of place if I were to give symbolicallycertain phrases and sentences which will indicate [329] (for each sign) this“growth of light in light,” as it is esoterically called, bearing in mind thatwe are attempting to express conditions connected with the soul whose essentialnature is light. This soul-light affects the form as evolution proceeds andproduces sequentially the revelation of that form, and of the nature ofspace-time as well as of the goal.1. Aries.—The Light of Life Itself . This is the dim point of light found at thecentre of the cycle of manifestation, faint and flickering. It is the“searchlight of the Logos, seeking that which can be used” for divineexpression.2. Taurus.—The penetrating Light of the Path . This is a beam of light,streaming forth from the point in Aries, and revealing the area of lightcontrol.3. Gemini.—The Light of Interplay . This is a line of light beams, revealingthat which opposes or the basic duality of manifestation, the relationship ofspirit and of form. It is the conscious light of that relationship.4. Cancer.—The Light within the form. This is the diffused light of substanceitself, the “dark light” of matter, referred to in The Secret Doctrine . It isthe light awaiting the stimulation coming from the soul light.5. Leo.—The Light of the Soul . A reflected point of light logoic, or divine.The light diffused in Cancer focusses and reveals eventually a point.6. Virgo.—The blended dual Light . Two lights are seen—bright and strong, thelight of form; one faint and dim, the light of God. This light is distinguishedby a waxing of one and the waning of the other. It differs from the light inGemini. [330]7. Libra.—The Light that moves to rest . This is the light that oscillates untila point of balance is achieved. It is the light which is distinguished by amoving up and down.8. Scorpio.—The Light of Day . This is the place where three lights meet—thelight of form, the light of soul, and the light of life. They meet; they blend;they rise.9. Sagittarius.—A beam of directed, focussed Light . In this the point of lightbecomes the beam, revealing a greater light ahead and illumining the way to thecentre of the light.10. Capricorn.—The Light of Initiation . This is the light which clears the wayto the mountain top, and produces transfiguration, thus revealing the risingsun.11. Aquarius.—The Light that shines on Earth, across the sea . This is the lightwhich ever shines within the dark and cleansing with its healing rays that whichmust be purified until the dark has gone.12. Pisces.—The Light of the World . This is the light, revealing the light oflife itself. It ends for ever the darkness of matter.A study of the above thoughts will reveal the symbolic story of the irradiationof matter, of the growth of the light body within the macrocosm and themicrocosm, and finally make clear the purpose of the Logos.It is because—speaking in parables—the light of Cancer is only diffused, vagueand inchoate that the influences of the first Ray of Focussed Intention and ofpurposeful Will and of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom (recognised duality andgained experience) are found to be missing. Their influences are not present,except in so far that love and purpose underlie all manifestation. But they arenot focussed in this [331] sign. Only five rays play through this constellationwhich even at a relatively high point of development and upon the returningwheel preserves ever the mass relationship for the benefit of the incarnatingindividual and in order to guarantee the ultimate salvation of substance itself.Human beings, without initiated vision, are apt to interpret all the signs andtheir effects in terms of individual man, whereas the purpose of theircoordinated influence is both planetary, solar and cosmic. The initiate who hastaken the three lower initiations is occupied henceforth with the effects of thecosmic influences upon the planet and incidentally upon the fourth kingdom innature and with the higher mental study of their effects as they produce basicand fundamental changes in the systemic life which, in its turn, affects ourplanet, its kingdoms in nature and incidentally human beings. You can see fromthis, therefore, that as the evolutionary changes are brought about and ashuman, planetary and solar consciousness progressively develops, the influencespouring from the constellations, via their intermediaries, the planets, willproduce very diverse changes and significant happenings to which man willconsciously or unconsciously respond according to his point of development. Theresponse of the individual Cancer subject to the incoming influences and to hisenvironment will be different to those of the disciple or initiate and theseagain will differ in every sign, thus rounding out human development. Here againis a point which astrologers will have later to take into consideration. I wouldhere like to give you a tabulation which will indicate somewhat the nature ofthe response of the man during the three stages of his development—undeveloped,advanced and upon the Path—to the various influences to which he is subjectedwhen he enters into physical plane existence through the open door of Cancer,and proceeds then through all the signs.

These relationships,it will be found, create quite definite geometrical forms just as the crosses,formed between the opposites create the three crosses of the heavens. I commendthis to your consideration. The above tabulation gives you a new and innerrelation of the signs to each other and one which only becomes definitely activeand effective after initiation. It is consequently of small use to the averagereader at this time, though it opens up, nevertheless, new astrological contactsand influences most of which are established through the ray influences andwhich require a grasp of individual evolutionary status for correctinterpretation. It is essential, for their right understanding that theastrologer knows whether the subject is relatively unevolved, whether he is anadvanced man or whether he is upon one or other stages of the Path. There is somuch to be reckoned with in the new esoteric astrology—prediction,interpretation from the standpoint of both the personality and the soul,character indications, as well as a close study of the Law of Rebirth as it canbe arrived at through an understanding of the influences of Cancer. One thingwhich will later emerge, but which is at present impossible of elucidation, isthe fact that the twelve Creative Hierarchies are all connected with one orother of the twelve signs of the zodiac and these all definitely affect thehuman family and the unit in that family also. A close study of the relationsindicated in this new tabulation and a study also of the Hierarchies and thesigns will cause a drastic revolution in modern astrology and one of most basicimportance. More [335] than this I cannot here indicate and more will not bepossible until the present astrologers have done some concentrated work alongthe lines here designated.Simple as it sounds when stated, the most fundamental point for astrologers tograsp today is the need for them to know—prior to interpretation—where, upon thepath of evolution, the subject under consideration stands. One other hint I willgive. It will be from a study of those people who are born in the Cardinal Signsthat the clearest information will emerge in this connection. It might be usefulto point out here that:1. Through a study of the Cardinal Cross—Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn—theastrologer can arrive at a clearer understanding:a. Of ordinary, individual, human beings.b. Of group beginnings.c. Of the significance of the first initiation.2. Through a study of the Fixed Cross—Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius—he willarrive at a right interpretation of the lives:a. Of initiates.b. Of group absorption into synthesis.c. Of the significance of the third initiation.3. Through a study of the Mutable Cross—Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces—hecan arrive at the significance:a. Of disciples.b. Of group activity.c. Of the second initiation.The above indications may not conform to the ideas generally held, and appear toreverse also some of the points [336] which I have earlier made, but a carefulstudy of the suggested implications may make the point clearer. Every Cross hasits exoteric significance and with this all astrologers are somewhat familiar;it has also its esoteric meaning and import and this is as yet an untried fieldof investigation; and it has its spiritual importance, and this of course isonly revealed at the major initiations. It should be remembered that these arethe threefold differentiations of the One Life and that Capricorn, for instance,marks not only the point of the deepest concretion and therefore of death butalso the point of highest initiation and of entrance into the life aspect ofdeity.I cannot too strongly reiterate the constant necessity for you to think in termsof energies and forces, of lines of force, and energy relationships; astrologersmust also think more in terms of qualities and of characteristics, as is thetrend of the more advanced astrology today. The whole story of astrology is, inreality, one of magnetic and magical interplay for the production orexternalisation of the inner reality; it is the story of the response ofform—vast as in a solar system, microcosmic as in a human being, and minute asin an atom or a cell—to the urge or pull of foci of energy and of streams offorce. These two are not identical, but must be taken into the calculations ofthe investigating astrologer and his interpretations.It is the focussed energy of Cancer which makes it a major magnetic orattractive focal point leading to the processes of incarnation. Through the doorof Cancer streams the “magnetic magical light which guides the soul into thedark place of experience.” Similarly, it is the magical pull of Capricornianenergy which upon the returning wheel (in contradistinction to the wheel ofrebirth or the outgoing wheel) of expression and of discipleship draws the [337]soul steadily away from form life and experience and constitutes that “radiantlight which leads the soul in safety to the mountain top.” In the recognition ofthis comes elucidation of the fact that in time and space the controlling factorand determining condition is the sensitivity of the incarnated soul to formlife, leading to incarnation through the door of Cancer, or to soul life,leading to initiation through the door of Capricorn. It is also in the relationof these two signs to each other that you get one of the clearest pictures ofthe interplay between the pairs of opposites as they exist in the zodiac, and itmight profit us here for a minute to study the two types of consummation whichthis interplay between opposite signs brings about. I will endeavour to putthese for you in tabular and suggestive form for your later consideration andstudy. The consummation on both the form side and the soul side might beexpressed as follows, bearing ever in mind the limitations of language:ON THE WHEEL TURNING CLOCKWISE(Aries to Taurus, via Pisces)For ordinary humanity.1. Aries-Libra.—Unstable embryonic beginnings leading to the balancing of thelower psychic nature and its expression through form. Embryonic desire forexpression consummates in the passion of satisfaction. Lower love controls.2. Taurus-Scorpio.—Powerful focussed lower desire leads to death and defeat. Thetriumph of the lower nature which eventuates in the awakening to satiety anddeath. The man is the prisoner of desire and at the moment of consummation knowshis prison. [338]3. Gemini-Sagittarius.—Fluid interplay and instability leads to personalityfocus and determination. The man is one-pointedly devoted to personalityachievement. The threefold lower nature, synthesised and directed controls allactivity.4. Cancer-Capricorn.—The urge to incarnate leads to the densest incarnation andimmersion in form. The pull of form life and the processes of concretisationcontrol. The man arrives after many incarnations at a point of crystallisation.5. Leo-Aquarius.—The individual seeks full expression and arrives finally at thepoint where he uses his environment for purely individual ends. He dominates hisfellowmen for entirely personality objectives. The isolated individual becomesthe group ruler or dictator.6. Virgo-Pisces.—Virgin matter attracts the soul and the divine Mother becomesmore important than the son. The life of the soul is hidden.ON THE WHEEL TURNING ANTI-CLOCKWISE(Aries to Pisces, via Taurus)The Disciple and Initiate.1. Libra-Aries.—The achieved equilibrium, at the point of rest, provides themental impetus for soul control. Passion is transmuted into love and the initialdesire of Aries becomes the full expression of love-wisdom. Desire to manifestbecomes the aspiration to be.2. Scorpio-Taurus.—The final victory of soul over form. Death and darknessdemonstrate as life and light as the result of this energy relationship. Thedark night of the soul becomes radiant sun. [339]3. Sagittarius-Gemini.—The result of this related pair of opposites is thatthere is one-pointed soul effort, spiritually directed activity and ademonstrated readiness for initiation. There is the waning of the power of formand the waxing of the life of the soul.4. Capricorn-Cancer.—The initiate now chooses to incarnate and passes freely andat will through both doors. The pull of matter is superseded by the free choiceof the soul. Form life becomes a conscious method of expression for service.5. Aquarius-Leo.—Personality interests as an expression of the individual aresubmerged in the good of the whole. Selfish individual man becomes the worldserver. Heights of noted service are then reached in both signs.6. Pisces-Virgo.—The form reveals and releases the indwelling soul. The Saviourof the world appears and nurtures the hidden souls in Virgo.You will, therefore, note that when the pull of the energies pouring into andthrough the signs of the zodiac is in the direction of form expression that theresult of the interplay between the opposite signs leads to some aspect ofdefinite personality manifestation, this being largely determined by the ray ofthe personality. When the life tendency is being withdrawn from form and thesoul is in process of revelation then there is soul or egoic emphasis, and thisagain is determined, as to quality, by the nature of the egoic ray. Here againwill appear the necessity for a knowledge of the point in evolution of theindividual whose horoscope is under consideration. I would indicate at thispoint that in studying any of the signs it will be wise to study at the sametime its opposite or consummating sign. Much that I could, for instance, say inconnection with the sign, Cancer, has already [340] been said in connection withits opposite, Capricorn, and the same will be true of all the signs which we arenow going to study.It will now be clear to you why the Moon and Neptune, transmitting the energiesof the psychic nature and of form, plus the tendency to achieve through themedium of conflict, rule Cancer so potently, both directly and indirectly. Theycontrol the form and the lower psychic nature and produce the battle ground(later to be transmuted into the burning ground) whereon these two “face in thefinal conflict” their higher correspondence, the soul and spirit, for matter isspirit at its lowest point and spirit is matter at its highest. In these wordsyou have the true clue to the Cancer-Capricorn relationship. When to thesepotent influences is added the force of the seventh ray (producing a synthesisof expression upon the physical plane) and of the third ray (producing intenseactivity in matter) you will note how in this sign all the energies concernedtend to bring about the incarnation of the soul in the three worlds ofexperience and human expression. The power of Venus in this sign tends to makethe mind the servant of the personality and this is aided by the forces of thethird Ray of Active Intelligence. Thus the stage is set for the appearance ofthe soul in form. You would find it an interesting study to compare the effectsof these ray potencies as they find expression in Cancer upon:1. The unevolved man as he demonstrates form control.2. The evolved man, initiate and Saviour as he demonstrates soul control. Theforces which controlled the soul whilst dominated by form become the instrumentsof world service.[341] As these results are studied, you will eventually arrive at an insightinto the relationships we touched upon earlier when we discussed the rulers ofthis sign—exoteric and esoteric—which brought the Cancer subject into contactwith Virgo, Aquarius and Scorpio. From one point of view, you have theimprisonment of the soul and the glorification of the personality demonstrated,ending with death in Scorpio; in the other you have the revelation of the Christwithin the form, the revelation of the serving individual and the revelation ofthe final victory over death. When to the above recognitions you add the placewhich the planets hold in this sign, you have a most remarkable and at the sametime rather abstruse situation indicated and—because this is the final cross ofinitiation—one which will only become really clear when the final stages of thepath are trodden. Therefore, only a few hints are possible. Two planets areexalted in this sign, Jupiter and Neptune. As this is the sign of rebirth, thesetwo planets indicate the successful development and eventual use of the formaspect and the development of psychic sensitivity both in the higher and thelower senses.These are important developments for the soul who has chosen to incarnate. Thebuilding of adequate forms and the use and control of form are essential ifthere is to be wise and right cooperation with the Plan of God. Jupiterguarantees this in Cancer from the very initial stage of birth. Love asrelationship to divinity and wisdom as relationship to form lie behind thesoul's intent. In space and time, for long aeons, form controls and hides thesoul. This is equally true in regard to the fluid psychic nature. These (theform aspect and the psychic nature) reach an eventual concrete perfection inCapricorn to become again in Cancer the perfect [342] instrument of servicewhich the initiate wields as he seeks to render mass service instead of beinginvolved and lost in the mass. The power of Saturn in this sign furthers theends and purposes of the governing energies or rays of harmony through conflicts(the Moon and Mercury) and of Neptune, for in this sign Saturn is in the home ofits detriment and thus produces those difficult conditions and situations whichwill lead to the needed struggle. This makes Cancer a place of symbolicimprisonment and emphasises the pains and penalties of wrong orientation. It isthe conflict of the soul with its environment—consciously or unconsciouslycarried on—which leads to the penalties of incarnation and which provides thoseconditions of suffering which the soul has willingly undertaken when—with openeyes and clear vision—the soul chose the path of earth life with all itsconsequent sacrifices and pains, in order to salvage the lives with which it hadan affinity.Curiously it is Sepharial who places the rulers of the decanates more accuratelythan does Leo. Usually this is reversed and Leo is the more correct of the twoastrologers. Sepharial gives us Venus, Mercury and the Moon whereas Leoapportions the Moon, Mars and Jupiter to these decanates. The mind, the uses ofconflict and form life are the contributing factors, leading the soul along theway of incarnation. The instrument of release is, in the last analysis, theright use and control of the organ of illumination which is the mind. Hence thenecessary emphasis ever laid upon meditation when the aspirant awakens tospiritual opportunity. The strength which comes through conflict and constantstruggle builds up steadily that reserve of strength and power which enables theaspirant to take the final tests of discipleship in Scorpio and to brave inCapricorn the [343] trials of initiation and the breaking of all the bonds whichthe processes of incarnation have forged.In the Words given for this sign, the Word of the soul indicates the objectiveof the Cancer experience and the purpose for which incarnation has been taken:“I build a lighted house and therein dwell.” The temporary method of thepersonality is also clearly given when we are told that the Word proclaimed bythe soul as it takes incarnation is “Let isolation be the rule and yet—the crowdexists.”This sign can carry deep meaning to all. You are in process of incarnation; youare following your chosen way. Is the house you are building yet lit? Is it alighted house, or is it a dark prison? If it is a lighted house, you willattract to its light and warmth all who are around you and the magnetic pull ofyour soul, whose nature is light and love, will save many. If you are still anisolated soul, you will have to pass through the horrors of a more completeisolation and loneliness, treading alone the dark way of the soul. Yet thisisolation, this loneliness and this separation in the dark night are all part ofthe Great Illusion. It is, however, an illusion into which the whole of humanityis now precipitated in preparation for unity, freedom and release. Some are lostin the illusion and know not what is reality and truth. Others walk free in theworld of illusion for the purposes of saving and lifting their brothers, and ifyou cannot do this, you will have to learn so to walk.GEMINI, THE TWINSIn the consideration of the remaining signs there will be relatively less to saythan before, because I have already pointed out many facts and points whendealing with their polar opposites. Much, therefore, that can be said about[344] the sign Gemini has been dealt with under Sagittarius; Virgo and Pisceshave also been considered in relation to this sign, because all these four signsform together the Mutable Cross. A certain amount of repetition is necessary andoften helpful; it serves to clarify and reinforce when one is teaching, but Iwould like now to be more general and—in dealing with these three signs whichindicate the subjective realities which incite the form-taking in Cancer—toconsider pre-disposing causes more than detailed and more easily ascertainedfacts.In this world cycle, Gemini, Taurus and Aries are three subjective energies orthe three conditioning signs which lie behind manifestation. They lie behind theform-taking experience in Cancer and they also lie behind manifestation inPisces. Pisces is the sign with which the modern world (and by that I refer toan immense long period of time) is primarily concerned, for Pisces is thestarting point on the clockwise wheel at this time for the greater zodiacalround of approximately 25,000 years—the date of which beginning is not yetrevealed to the modern astrologer or subject to revelation through his science.As we study Gemini and Taurus (Aries we have already considered) let us bear inmind their cause-initiating nature and the fact that they have a morespecifically psychic effect and subjective influence than their strictlyphenomenal and physical effects would lead one to imagine.You will find, I think, that it is these hints and suggestions which are of themost importance in launching and in utilising the new esoteric astrology.Students would do well to isolate first of all the broad general statementsanent the zodiacal signs and influence before they take up the intensive studyof the detailed and new informative suggestions which I may have given. A graspof the universals, [345] prior to a study of the particulars, is ever a wiseoccult procedure.In each of the Crosses of the Heavens there is one sign and influence which, inany world cycle, dominates the other three. Such dominating effects necessarilychange when a world cycle changes, but for the present cycle, Gemini determinesthe paramount influence within the fourfold influence of the Mutable Cross. Themain objective of these four energies is to produce that constant flux andperiodic change in time and space which will provide a field of adequateexperience for the unfoldment of the Christ life and consciousness. This is thecase cosmically speaking, and also from the standpoint of a solar system, of aplanet and of a human being. The field of development for the lower threekingdoms is dependent upon the status and energy-distributing power of humanityas a whole. We might, therefore, recognise the following facts anent the MutableCross:Gemini.—This is the force which produces the changes needed for the evolution ofthe Christ consciousness at any particular point in time and space. It is alwayscompatible to the requirement.Virgo.—This is the nurturing force of substance itself, subject to the ninecyclic changes of the cosmic gestation period; it fosters and protects theembryonic Christ life, preparing for manifestation or a divine incarnation.Sagittarius.—Is the energetic activity of the life force, demonstrating at thesixth month, when—esoterically speaking—the three aspects of the form nature andthe three aspects of the soul are integrated and functioning. It is thisintegration which sometimes makes the sixth month of physical human gestation socritical.Pisces.—This is the life expression and active appearance [346] of the Christconsciousness in form; it is also the energetic appearance (symbolicallyspeaking) of a world saviour.This Mutable Cross is, therefore, peculiarly a Christian symbol andsignificantly connected with the Christ life and with the unfoldment of a worldsaviour and is particularly potent during the anti-clockwise turning of theGreat Wheel. This fact will emerge more clearly when astrologers are able todetermine accurately the point of development and the spiritual status of thesubject whose horoscope is under consideration. The formless nature of theinfluences of Gemini is strikingly borne out if the significance of Masonry isstudied. This world-wide institution was—as I have earlier told you—organisedunder the influence and impulse of this sign and is governed by it in a mostunusual manner. The format or exoteric symbolism of Masonry has frequently beenchanged during the millenia of years through which it has been active. Itspresent Jewish colouring is relatively modern and not necessarily enduring, butits significance and its history of unfoldment are the history of the indwellingChrist consciousness and of that inner light, and this must unalterably becontinued. That which has entered through the two pillars of Hercules, thedisciples (Jachin and Boaz), and through the sign Gemini, has entered to stay.Apart from the importance of the influences of Gemini as the dominant power inthe Mutable Cross, it is one of the paramount zodiacal signs in that it is themajor symbol of duality in the zodiac. It is the constellation Gemini and itsinherent second ray influence which control every one of the pairs of oppositesin the Great Wheel. Gemini, therefore, forms with each of the pairs of oppositesin the Zodiac a third factor, powerfully influencing the other twoconstellations, [347] and thus forms, with them, certain great zodiacaltriangles. These only become of importance when considering the horoscopes ofadvanced human beings or esoteric groups, but eventually—when casting thehoroscope of a disciple or an initiate—the esoteric astrologer will have toconsider their potency. For instance, in the case of an initiate whose Sun is inLeo, the triangle of constellation energies determining the interpretation ofthe horoscope would be Leo-Aquarius-Gemini. When dealing with a subject whoseSun is in Gemini itself, the conditioning triangle would be Gemini-Sagittariusand Pisces—the latter forming a part of this triangle because it marks both theend and the beginning and is, for this great cycle of the zodiac, the Alpha andthe Omega. These points I will endeavour to elucidate in greater detail whentaking up with you the basic astrological Science of Triangles. Thegeneralisations and the hints in connection with the twelve signs of the zodiacwhich have formed the subject matter of our past instructions have beenprimarily intended to lay the ground and to prepare your minds for the latersection upon triangles; this will be far the most important aspect of theteaching on esoteric astrology and the one which will be the first to be graspedby modern astrology.This sign is sometimes called the “constellation of the resolution of dualityinto a fluid synthesis.” Governing as it does all the pairs of opposites in thezodiac, it preserves the magnetic interplay between them, keeping them fluid intheir relations, in order eventually to facilitate their transmutation intounity, for the two must finally become the One. It should be rememberedthat—from the angle of the final development of the twelve zodiacalpotencies—the twelve opposites must become the blended six, and this is broughtabout by the fusion in consciousness of the polar [348] opposites. Pause andconsider this phrasing. The opposites eternally remain from the point of view ofhuman reason, but to the initiate whose intuition is functioning they constitutebut six great potencies, because he has achieved “the freedom of the two,” as itis sometimes called. For instance, the Leo subject who has an initiatedconsciousness preserves the individuality, developed in Leo, as well as theuniversality of Aquarius; he can function, if he so chooses, as a fullyself-identified individual, yet possesses simultaneously a fully awakeneduniversal awareness; the same thing can be said of balanced activity andconsequent fusion in all the signs. This analysis constitutes in itself aninteresting and far-reaching field of speculation.Gemini is, therefore, one of the most important of the twelve signs and itsinfluence lies behind everyone of them—a fact but little realised as yet byastrologers. This will be more fully understood when the triangle of Gemini andtwo opposing signs is studied. Because the Ray of Love-Wisdom, the second ray,pours through Gemini it becomes apparent how true is the occult teaching thatlove underlies the entire universe. God is love, we are assured, and thisstatement is both an exoteric and an esoteric truth. This underlying love ofDeity reaches our solar system primarily through Gemini, which forms, with theconstellation of the Great Bear and the Pleiades, a cosmic triangle. This is thetriangle of the cosmic Christ and is the esoteric symbol lying behind the cosmicCross. There is ever the eternal triangle to be found behind the fourfoldphenomenal appearance. Speaking symbolically and in the words of the OldCommentary :“Upon the golden triangle, the cosmic Christ appeared; His head in Gemini; onefoot upon the field [349] of the Seven Fathers and the other planted in thefield of the Seven Mothers (these two constellations are sometimes called theSeven Brothers and the Seven Sisters. A.A.B.). Thus for aeons, the Great Onestood, His consciousness inturned, aware of three but not of four. Intent, withsuddenness, He heard a sound go forth.... Arousing to that cry, He stretchedHimself, reached forth both arms in understanding love, and, lo, the Cross wasformed.“He heard the cry of the Mother (Virgo), of the Seeker (Sagittarius), and of thesubmerged Fish (Pisces). Then, lo, the Cross of change appeared, though Geminiremained the head. This is the mystery.”In this occult statement is hidden one reason why Gemini is regarded as an airsign, for it is cosmically related (as are Libra and Aquarius, the other twopoints of the airy triplicity) in a most peculiar way to the Great Bear, to thePleiades and to Sirius. The relation is essentially a sixfold one, and here youwill find a hint as to the resolution of the pairs of opposites—involving asthese three constellations do the three ideas ofopposition-equilibrium-synthesis or universal fusion. It might be stated that:1. Gemini—forms a point of entrance for cosmic energy from Sirius.2. Libra—is related to and transmits the potencies of the Pleiades.3. Aquarius—expresses the universal consciousness of the Great Bear.It might be profitable to you to bear in mind at this point what I have oftentold you, that the great White Lodge on [350] Sirius is the spiritual prototypeof the great White Lodge on Earth, of which modern Masonry is the distortedreflection, just as the personality is a distorted reflection of the soul. Iwould also remind you again of the relation between Gemini and Masonry to whichreference has frequently been made.A close consideration of what I have said above will serve to emphasise in yourconsciousness the importance of this constellation, Gemini, and the innersignificance of the Mutable Cross. All the constellations on this Cross markpoints of change or are the custodians of those energies which produce theneeded periods of re-orientation, preparatory to fresh developments and newactivities. It might be of interest if I pointed out that:1. The Mutable Cross—brings about those conditions which will produce greatperiods of change in the life of the planet, of a kingdom in nature or of ahuman being. Mercury plays a part in this.2. The Fixed Cross—brings about, as a sequence, to these inner changes, certaingreat points of crisis which are unavoidable and present definite opportunity.Saturn is dominant in bringing this about.3. The Cardinal Cross—is responsible for bringing about certain great points ofsynthesis , as a consequence of both change and crisis. Jupiter is responsiblefor the focussing of energies at this point.I will enlarge upon this later, but the above will give you (even in this briefform) certain positive ideas of great importance, and will indicate certainsituations which can be looked for in the lives of those whose Sun is in one orother of these signs and on one or other of these Crosses.[351] In the expression of the activity of this sign of duality, it issubjective energy we must consider as it produces objective effects. This signcontrols esoterically the heart of our solar system and thus controls thepulsation of life which sustains all that is. Gemini is, therefore, connectedwith the heart of the Sun, just as Cancer is related to the physical Sun andAquarius to the central spiritual Sun. Here again, you have a significanttriangle of a cosmic nature, the energies of which are focussed through thethree aspects of the Sun in a most mysterious fashion:1. Cancer . . . physical Sun . . . . . . . 3rd aspect . . . intelligent activityof the Whole. 2. Gemini . . . heart of the Sun . . . . . 2nd aspect . . . loveof the Whole. 3. Aquarius . . central spiritual Sun. . 1st aspect . . . the willof the Whole.Through these signs the three major aspects of divinity are at this timefocussed. In casting the horoscope of the planet (a thing that has never yetbeen accurately done, owing to the lack of data available to the exotericastrologer) it is the influence of these three constellations which will befound of dominating importance. In Cancer , you have the intelligent syntheticconsciousness of the mass, viewing it from the consciousness of matter itselfand the awareness of all forms and atoms; in Gemini , you have an emergingrecognition of duality, leading to experience and growth in all separativeintelligent forms; in Aquarius , you have the results of the activity of Cancerand Gemini, producing a higher synthesis and a universal group awareness. Thisthe intelligent student can trace with moderate facility in relation tohumanity, but it applies equally to all forms in all kingdoms of nature and alsoto planetary and solar expression. The proved reality of this is one of thedevelopments of the initiatory process at the end of the long, long path [352]of evolution. Attraction and repulsion are therefore conditioning factors in oursolar life, and this conditioning reaches us through Gemini. It is the effect ofa cosmic energy at present unknown to humanity. The waxing and the waning lightwhich distinguishes soul experience from the first faint move towardsincarnation and Earth experience, the rise and fall of civilisations and thegrowth and unfoldment of all cyclic manifestations are produced by the“interplay between the two brothers,” as it is called. In that far-off time whenthe greater round of the zodiac was started in Gemini, as now it is in Pisces,there was a relation between the waxing and the waning moon, due to thepulsating power of Gemini. This is now greatly lessened, owing to the removal ofthe responsive life from the Moon, but the rhythm then set up still remains,producing the same basic illusion. I am talking here in terms of ancient factsand not in terms of reflection, as is now the case. I refer to realities and notto shadows.Gemini, as you may now begin to grasp, is related to the etheric body; it is thecustodian of conditioning energy and the intermediary, as far as basicessentials are concerned, between soul and body. These are the two alliedbrothers. In the average person, the etheric vehicle is the transmitter ofpsychic energy, galvanising and coordinating the dense physical body andpermitting, therefore, astral and mental control of the personality. When theman is upon the Path of Discipleship and, therefore, upon the reversed wheel,leading to initiation, the etheric body becomes the transmitter of soul energyand not of personality force; the powerful effect of the second Ray ofLove-Wisdom—working through the subjective six rays, according to raytype—begins steadily to dominate the vital body, producing consequently theshift of force and of intensity to the [353] centres above the diaphragm. Thepower of the personality lessens and wanes whilst that of the soul waxes andgrows. There is much to be learned from the study of the dual activity—higherand lower—of the etheric body and its relation to and responsiveness to theconstellation, Gemini, but it is too abstruse for the ordinary student. It isnevertheless an esoteric fact to be borne in mind and will be some day of realservice to the astrology of the future, for some day astrology will be lifted upto a higher plane. True interpretation will come and true healing in alldepartments of human living through a proper understanding of the availablepotencies and energies pouring into the planet at any particular time.We come now to a consideration of the Rulers of this sign and there is much tobe learnt from a study of them. The orthodox ruler is Mercury who, as theMessenger of the Gods or the “divine Intermediary, carries messages between thepoles with speed and light.” In this most potent and important planet the ideaof duality is again to he found, enhancing and enhanced by the influence ofGemini. Mercury is the expression of the dual aspect of the mind as it mediatesbetween the higher and the lower. This mediation again falls into two stages:the use of the concrete mind as the mediator within the personality,conditioning the personality life, analysing and distinguishing between thehuman self and the not-self and emphasising the “me and thou” consciousness aswell as that of the personality and its environment. Secondly, it carries themessages between the soul and the brain and establishes right relation betweenthe lower self and the higher self; it is, therefore, the illumined mind,relating soul and personality. This process of the higher relationship iscarried forward with rapidity upon the Path of Discipleship. There is a third[354] aspect of Mercury which begins to function when the other two areperfected or in process of rapid perfecting. Mercury, in this case, is theabstract mind—removed from all form contact as we understand it—and relates souland spirit, and this again in two stages. Mercury is the revealer of theSpiritual Triad (atma-buddhi-manas or spiritual will, spiritual love and thehigher mind) to the soul, and this carries the disciples to the stage of thethird initiation. It is then the revealer of the life aspect during theprocesses of the higher initiations, but upon these it is not necessary for usto enlarge.In a peculiar way, therefore, Mercury increases in the Gemini subject the latentsense of duality in its various stages and also the sense of distinction,leading to that mental agility and that fluidity of mind which is one of themajor assets as well as one of the major difficulties of this sign. This agilityhas, however, to be rightly understood and handled. When there is facility ofmental approach in any direction and in connection with the many opposites inmanifestation, you have the emergence of the divine Messenger in his truecharacter, able to comprehend extremes and to relate them divinely to eachother. Gemini is pre-eminently the sign of the messenger, and this sign producesmany of the messengers of God as they appear down the ages, the revealers of newdivine truths and the intermediaries between the fourth and fifth kingdoms.It is for this reason that you have the exoteric ruler given as Mercury and theesoteric ruler as Venus, for they embody between them the energies of the fourthRay of Harmony through Conflict and the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge orScience which is embryonic understanding of causes and conditions resultingtherefrom and also of the Plan.Again you find the note of duality in the relationship [355 ] (established bythe activity of these two rulers) between the third kingdom of nature, theanimal kingdom and the kingdom of God or of souls, the fifth kingdom in nature,thus producing the fourth or human kingdom. Between these two the influencesplay from Sagittarius to Gemini and vice versa. It was the activity ofVenus—under the influence of Gemini—which produced the great crisis of theindividualisation when the two kingdoms “approached” each other. Venus, Mercuryand the Earth then set up a magnetic field which made the intervention of theGreat Lodge on Sirius and the dual stimulation of Gemini effective in producingsignificant results of which the fourth kingdom in nature is the expression. Thefact that Gemini is the third sign and embodies what is called “a third potency”enabled it to reach, with its force, the third kingdom and produce that reactionwhich resulted in the individualising or the humanising of its higher forms oflife. You will note that Venus is also the hierarchical ruler of Capricorn, thusshowing the power of the mind and its place and purpose in connection with boththe major human crises: Individualisation and Initiation. It relates humanity inan unique way to Gemini. In the coming world religion this fact will be notedand in the month of June, which is essentially the month in which the influencesof Gemini are peculiarly strong, due advantage will be taken in order to bringman nearer to the spiritual realities. Just as Venus was potent in producing therelation of such pairs of opposites as the fifth kingdom of souls and the thirdkingdom (the synthesis of the sub-human kingdoms) leading to a Great Approachbetween soul and form, so in the new world religion this fact will berecognised. Appeal will be made to the Forces which can utilise this planetarypotency in order to work out the divine plan upon the Earth. It is because Venusthus [356] relates certain pairs of opposites that she has been erroneouslyconnected in the minds of men with sex and the sex life and with the relation ofthe physical opposites, male and female.It is interesting to discover that the hierarchical ruler of Gemini is the Earthitself, which is a non-sacred planet. The Earth is also the esoteric ruler ofSagittarius, the polar opposite of Gemini. These are the only two constellationsruled by the Earth, and this fact is of major significance, creating an unusualsituation in the solar system and a unique relation. The cosmic line of forcefrom Gemini to Sagittarius and the reverse is subjectively and esotericallyrelated to our Earth, thus guaranteeing its soul development, the unfoldment ofform as an expression of that soul, and leading our sorrowful humanity upon thiswoeful planet inevitably to the very gate of initiation in Capricorn.In this statement and in the fact of the pain and sorrow which aredistinguishing qualities of our planetary life lies hid a secret mystery.Through this relationship and through the medium of the potencies pouring intoour planet, a situation is set up which I might express in the words of the OldCommentary :“When the dual forces of the cosmic brothers (Gemini) become the energy of theone who rides towards the light (Sagittarius) then the fourth becomes the fifth.Humanity, the link, becomes the Hierarchy, the bestower of all good. Then allthe Sons of God rejoice.”A slight study will show you that you have in these three rulers a mostinteresting sequence of forces, for Rays 3, 4, and 5 produce a synthesis ofactivity and of [357] eager potencies which are essential for the development ofhumanity. In this world cycle and for humanity as it is now constituted youhave:1. Ray 3.—Active Intelligence, under the influence of this third sign, Gemini,slowly conditioning the etheric body.2. Ray 4.—Harmony through Conflict, under the influence of Gemini-Sagittarius,staging those situations upon the astral plane which will produce the conflictin the astral body which is essential to the final treading of the burningground and subsequent release.3. Ray 5.—Concrete Knowledge or Science, under the influence of Capricorn,focussed through Venus, which will enable the man to take initiation.These three energies, focussed through the three planets governing Gemini, areessentially dedicated to the development of the fourth kingdom in nature and arepolarised in the Earth, itself one of the rulers.Mercury, the star of conflict, is also the major planet of relationships, for itgoverns and “engineers” (if I may use such a term) the interplay between ourEarth with its conditioning constellations. In the case of Gemini, it relatesour small planet to Virgo (Mutable Cross), to Aries (Cardinal Cross) and toScorpio (Fixed Cross), and its mission, therefore, emerges as one of supremeimportance. Through the medium of this inter-relation and consequentintercourse, the three cosmic Crosses become closely related and, in Gemini,certain of the fundamental zodiacal influences—synthesised and coordinated—arefocussed upon our planet. This produces strain, action and reaction, and thatcondition of potent struggle and of difficulty which is so characteristic of ourplanetary life, but which produces eventually the awakening of humanity to fullplanetary consciousness, [358] and, in the case of the planetary Logos, to fullcosmic consciousness.This effect is most powerful in Gemini owing to the fact that the two arms ofthe Mutable Cross are thus related, and the result of the activity of Mercury asit rules Gemini is to produce a steady pull between the pairs of opposites; inVirgo it produces that interior struggle between the exoteric not-self and theesoteric self, between the form-consciousness (planetary, human and subhuman)and the soul within all forms. In considering this subject you will have toconsider the following astrological formations:1. Gemini . . . . . . . . . . . Virgo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Mercury. TheEarth 2. Gemini . . . . . . . . . . . Aries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Mercury.The Earth 3. Gemini . . . . . . . . . . . Scorpio . . . . . . . . . . . .Mercury. The EarthThe importance of these triple formations being based on the fact that they areconditioning triangles, with the energies of two constellations focussed throughMercury upon the Earth, i.e.[Image00007.jpg]The potencies of Gemini-Aries, instilled into our planetary life via Mercury,focus the energy of the conditioning will-to-be upon the Earth, producinginitial beginnings [359] as in incarnation, or initiation, or the start oforganisation as well as organisms. It should be remembered that there is thewill-to-be in form and the will-to-be free from form, but all these aspects ofwill are achieved through conflict and interplay of which energy both Gemini andMercury are the eternal symbols.Mercury, as it relates Gemini to Scorpio and to our planet, has a mass orgeneral effect, for it is the hierarchical ruler of Scorpio and its effect is ofa planetary nature far more than is usually the case, and is, therefore, farmore difficult to trace at our present point of planetary development and humanconsciousness. Its true significance will not be understood until theconsciousness of individual man is also planetary in its scope and grasp, whichis never the case until after the third initiation. I have here emphasised twoof these relationships between the constellations and the Earth even though itis not possible for you to grasp the implications. So often in our studies, oneis apt to forget that it is not possible for any unit of consciousness, withinthe planetary sphere of influence, to conceive of conditions as they exist apartfrom the Earth because that small planet is inevitably for that unit the verycentre of his known universe and—under the Great Illusion—the constellationswith their rulers and with their prototypal counterparts revolve around theEarth. When man has progressed further and his consciousness is beginning toawaken to reality, the nature of this illusion will become apparent to him, butat present this is not possible. Even theoretically it is not possible. Study,for instance, what I can still further add as to the influence of these relatedconstellations and see whether it truly conveys to you any exact knowledgebeyond a general idea of focussed energies and related forces. Let me,therefore, add:[360] The influence of Mercury, as it relates Aries and Gemini to our Earth,establishes in time and space a unique situation, for it incites to trialefforts or initiates a series of beginnings in order to relate opposing forcesand produce certain planned and definite effects upon our planet, thusinfluencing the kingdoms in nature or an individual soul-in-form. A conflict isthus initiated which leads finally to balance.This leads to an intermediate consummation in Libra.The influence of Mercury as it relates Virgo and Gemini is to condition the soulwithin the form and subject it to those influences which will lead to theintensification of the ordinary evolutionary process and the consequent waxingof the soul light and the waning of the light in matter itself. This initiatesthe struggle which, in a human being, is consciously realised as being betweensoul and personality.This leads to a final stage in Capricorn.The influence of Mercury as it relates Scorpio and Gemini is to inaugurate thatfinal stage in consciousness which will place the soul within the form surely inthe place of power, swinging the earlier achieved balance and control definitelyinto the realm of the soul. It is this which, in the Scorpio experience,produces the terrific experience of the disciple and which, at this time, is oneof the predisposing causes of the present world conflict. It is of interest tonote that the struggle is going to be conditioned primarily by decisions arrivedat in London (which is ruled by Gemini) and in the United States (which is alsogoverned by Gemini). Humanity is now upon the Path of Discipleship as I havefrequently told you and Scorpio rules that path; Gemini governs the way of manychanges which conditions the struggle which began in Aries, focussed in Cancer,is brought to [361] a crisis in Scorpio and ended in Capricorn. When Gemini,Scorpio and Mercury are correctly related we shall see the United States movingalso on to the Path of Discipleship through a release from its presentself-centred policy, its well-meaning evasion of responsibility and its innatefears and distrust. When the focus of the power in London is also rightlyoriented and is released into increased effectiveness by drastic purification ofmotive, then the united effect of both these clarifications will be humanliberation. These facts are being slowly realised in London, ahead of therealisation which is more slowly awakening in the States.These potencies, when effective, lead to true service in Aquarius.All this activity is intensified by two facts: one is that the Earth is thehierarchical ruler of Gemini and the other that Venus is the esoteric ruler.This intensifies all that goes on and leads to the unfoldment upon our planet ofthe consciousness of universality—to which the word “Hierarchy” is the key.Venus is also the Earth's alter ego, as it is called in the occult literature,and its true supplementary and complementary planet. You have thus established adouble dual relationship: that of Gemini itself, the two brothers, and that ofthe Earth and Venus. The Earth is peculiarly related to the “brother whose lightis waning,” for it is not a sacred planet, as you know, and to that aspect ofdivinity which is material or substantial; Venus is closely related to the“brother whose light grows stronger cycle by cycle” and thus to the soul whosenature is love. It is this Gemini-Venus situation which lies behind the factthat our Earth is uniquely the “planet of releasing sorrow and of purifyingpain,” the energy producing these releasing factors being focussed throughMercury and Venus upon our Earth. You will see, therefore, the significance ofthat triangle of planets [362] (at which I hinted in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire): the Earth-Venus-Mercury. From certain angles, these are related to thePersonality of our planetary Logos:1. The Earth—planetary vital body.2. Venus—planetary astral vehicle, or Kama-manas.3. Mercury—planetary mind.The Earth itself is, on a small scale, also an intermediary or a relatingplanet, because it is found ruling both Gemini and Sagittarius and is potent,therefore, only within the line of this dual relationship, existing between thisparticular pair of opposites. In the Earth a great balancing process is goingforward between two great streams of cosmic energy, emanating the one fromSagittarius and the other from Gemini. This condition, aided and influenced byMercury and Venus, produces the somewhat unusual situation in our planet.Venus also establishes an interplay between Taurus, Gemini, Libra and Capricorn,which again (because the Earth is one of the rulers of Gemini) produces the“desperate conflict of the imprisoned soul upon the astral plane” whichcharacterises our planetary life. These four-fold influences and relationshipsproduce the minor initiations of the astral plane which ever precede the majorinitiations in Capricorn, in their turn prepared for in Scorpio. Taurus poursthe energy stimulating desire, via Venus, onto our Earth; Gemini, via Venus,awakens in humanity (the focal point of our planetary effort) the sense ofduality which is the basic factor in the conflict between desire and spiritualwill; in Libra this reaches a point of balance wherein the one who strugglessees the issues clearly and achieves a desirable point of equilibrium throughthe wise use of the Mercury-Venus mind, ensuring the success of its finalefforts in Capricorn. [363] You will note, therefore, how necessary it is torealise accurately the point in evolution of the soul.The three planets ruling and conditioning Gemini (through out-drawn activity,though not through their own influence) are in this third sign effective inconstituting this dual sign a working triplicity; it is the aid they give to ourEarth which produces the appearance in form of the dual energies of soul and thesubjective psychic personality. Ponder on this. It is the energies of the fifth,fourth and third rays, pouring through Venus, Mercury and the Earth, which areproductive of the eternally recurring, divine triplicity and its work ofreleasing the soul from the influence of form.We have here considered the rays which directly affect our planet, the Earth,which are focussed through the three ruling planets and which emanate fromcertain of the constellations. In the last analysis, the planet is the result orthe effect (should I say, resultant effect) of the ray influence, just as in thehuman being the physical body is the effect of the governing rays. Through theplanets certain potencies manifest. These are three in number, and I might herepoint out that the sacred planets—so-called—are those ray potencies which areexpressive of soul and spirit, with the personality ray of the great informingLife, the planetary Logos, subordinated to the two higher rays, such as is thecase with the man after the third initiation. A non-sacred planet, such as theEarth, is still subject to the ray of the personality of the informing Life, andthe correspondence to the esoteric monadic ray is non-effective.Indirectly, Gemini is ruled by the rays transmitting those potencies which, withGemini, constitute the Mutable Cross. These are the Moon, Jupiter, Mars andPluto. They transmit energies expressive of the fourth, second, sixth and first[364] rays. Only one ray is, therefore, lacking where Gemini is concerned, andthat is the seventh Ray of Organization, Ceremonial Magic and Ritual. Thisaccounts for the instability and the fluidity of the Gemini influence, and islargely responsible for the frequent failure of the Gemini person to express thebeauty, ideals, etc., which are sensed so that they materialise upon thephysical plane. The seventh ray produces fixation upon the exoteric level ofexperience and “anchors” (if I may use such a term) the ray forces into form,producing concrete expression of the subjective realities or powers. Six forcesmeet in Gemini and, for this reason, the double triangle or King Solomon's sealis one of the subjective symbols of this sign, linking it again with the Masonictradition and indicating also again the essential dualism of this sign.All the inner potencies are, therefore, present and only the stabilising seventhray energy is omitted from the dowry of the man born in Gemini. Thus we caneasily account for the versatility of the Gemini subject. The effectiveness ofMercury is also enhanced in its interpretive aspect because the Gemini personcan always find points of contact with people on nearly every ray. This is aninteresting point to remember if you will realise that the great Masonic ritualwas inaugurated under the influence of this sign, and yet—the ray of ritual wasomitted. This is due to the fact of reaction, producing opposition and thereforeinterplay and struggle. Hence the tests and trials of the Masonic procedure.The indirect influence of the Moon as it symbolically embodies the fourth Ray ofHarmony through Conflict provides Mercury with the dual tendency to struggle,which is characteristic of this sign, and also the dual tendency to harmonywhich is the inevitable result of all spiritual conflict. [365] In connectionwith the duality of conflict, you should bear in mind that there is a conflictof the evolutionary process, leading finally to the conflict upon the Path.These are the two aspects of struggle: unconscious and under the direction ofthe form; and conscious, or under the direction of the soul. There is also theharmonising of the personality and the achieving of personality integration;this is a consequence or goal of the first conflict, and then there is theattaining of harmony between soul and form; this is arrived at by the struggleupon the final stages of the Path.Thus again the essential dualism of this sign becomes apparent. When the Jupiterinfluence becomes strong and powerful in this sign, it indicates the initiateand the rapidly attained “dualism in synthesis” of soul and spirit. Through theactivity of Mercury, the man whose Sun is in Gemini is aided to attain thesynthesis of soul and form; through the activity of Jupiter, the man whoserising sign is Gemini is enabled to attain the conscious integration of soul andspirit. Note these two points for they are of real significance. The conflictwhich produces these stages in consciousness is fostered by the indirectinfluence of the planet Mars. Mars carries the war into the very depth ofcircumstance, environment and being, and confers at the same time such devotionto the visioned objective—as seen at any particular point upon the path—thatfinal failure is rendered impossible. Towards the end of the evolutionaryprocess, the disciple begins to respond consciously to the fourth indirectinfluence—that of Pluto, producing the death of the hindering factors and of allthat prevents synthesis. Pluto, as it affects Gemini, brings about the death orthe finish of the separative, instinctual nature, for this is the factor whichlies behind all dualism; it is inherent in what The Secret Doctrine calls theprinciple of ahankara or the awareness of the [366] separative, isolated ego; itis inimical for aeons to the aspiration of the imprisoned soul, focussed withinor identified with some aspect of the personality, and, in a later stage, withthe personality itself.In this analysis of the various signs I have not given much time to theconsideration of the effect of the zodiacal signs upon the physical body. Thisis a science in itself and is closely tied up with the entire theory ofspiritual healing. I would like, however, to touch upon the relation of Geminito the physical form, for it is so truly symbolic of the processes of divineunfoldment and therefore most timely.Gemini rules the arms and the hands, indicating the service which the twobrothers must render to each other in producing the dissolution (under Pluto) ofthe separative relation which exists for so long between them. It is the healthunto life that is here to be considered, and for this reason Gemini governs alsothe oxygenation of the blood, leading as a result to life activity and to thefree interplay and circulation of the spirit-soul aspect throughout all thecomplex organisms within the corporate form. Where there is the free flow of thelife force and no impediment to the circulation of the life fluid, via theblood, there will consequently and normally be the presence of perfect health.It is the understanding of this law which produces in the initiate the conditionof controlled health and chosen immortality which is the stated objective ofmany schools of mental healing. These are as you know (without exception), sopurely mystical and unscientific that their achievements are practically nil.They uphold the ideal but fail of the consummation.Gemini also governs the nervous system and the fluid reactions of the entirenervous organism. Hence you have, in this sign and its activity, the tendency tothe eventual control [367] of the two aspects of the soul to which I have madesuch constant reference in my books: the life aspect seated in the heart andusing the blood stream as its mode of interplay and of life-giving expression,and the consciousness aspect, seated in the head and using the nervous system asits mode or condition or process of expression. To these must be added both thedirect and the indirect effect of the rays which rule the sign. It is throughthe understanding of life and consciousness, as governed by Gemini, that thefinal release can be mentally achieved. Ponder upon this statement, for inGemini, the disciple can come to some intelligent grasp of what we might callthe consciousness-mechanism and of the life processes which enable man finallyto be what he is. Gemini also rules the thymus gland which is inactive atpresent in the adult person, owing to the fact that the heart centre isunawakened in the majority. It will, however, become active when “the immortalbrother floods the mortal brother with the light and life of God.” Then theheart centre, with its correlating activity of consciousness (groupunderstanding and group love) will function freely. The mystery of the sign isin reality concerned with the secret of the response which should and eventuallywill exist between the two brothers, between the two poles—soul and form—andbetween the mortal self or personality and the immortal self or soul.Sensitivity and quick reaction are characteristic of people born with the Sun inthis sign or with Gemini rising. This leads in the earlier stages and with theundeveloped person to a fluid versatility; in the later and more advanced stagesit leads to an equally fluid but analytical understanding of men and ofcircumstances. This is brought about through the constant activity, theceaseless movement and the unending changing conditions which are inherent inthe sign itself; these “pulsate between [368] the two aspects” of this dualsign, and are enhanced by the fact that Gemini is the most important aspect ofthe Mutable Cross, setting or determining the changes and their rate ofprogression.In the polar opposite of this sign, Sagittarius, the interplay between the twobrothers or between the lower and the higher selves, is focussed or conditionedinto one united and directed effort. The versatile changeable man becomes theself-directed disciple, one-pointed in effort, yet preserving all theversatility earlier developed but controlling and governing the tendency tofluidity, to lost motion and to misdirected change. I dealt with much of thiswhen we were studying the sign Sagittarius, and it is, therefore, unnecessary torepeat it here.It is of great interest to the initiate or to the advanced disciple to realisethat in this sign no planet either falls or is exalted. The clue to this mysterylies hid in the fact that, in the intermediate stage between Gemini andSagittarius, equilibrium, balance, fusion and blending are the objectives of thestruggling and almost blinded conscious entity. He must achieve harmony with aconsequent avoidance of all extremes. The seven signs—inclusive of Gemini andSagittarius—are of extreme importance where humanity is concerned:Gemini .— Subjective in nature. Vital. Is not focussed upon the physical plane.Is focussed upon the mortal brother.Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio — Are strictly human signs with theirrecognition of duality, emphasised in the central sign Virgo.Sagittarius. — Subjective in nature. Vital. Is not focussed in consciousnessupon the physical plane. Is focussed upon the immortal brother.[369] In Sagittarius the same condition is found. No planet is exalted and noplanet falls. Mercury is, however, in detriment or its influence is lessened. InGemini, the above is true of Jupiter. Why this is so, is, esoterically speaking,one of the secrets of initiation. The clue to the mystery lies in the basic,spiritual dualism of Jupiter in contradistinction to the body-soul dualism ofGemini; in Sagittarius, the dualism of Mercury as it expresses itself in thelower-higher mind is transcended by the universal or spiritual mind. More thanthis hint is not at this time possible.In connection with the decanates and their rulers, it is interesting to findthat Sepharial and Alan Leo give entirely different ruling planets, and yet bothare right. Uniquely for him, Sepharial gives the three planets of Jupiter, Marsand the Sun, and thus indicates those which are the esoteric rulers of the signupon the wheel of discipleship. Usually his choice is exoteric and not esoteric.Leo, in this case, gives Mercury, Venus and Saturn, and these three govern thewheel of ordinary life. Between them, they cover the wheel as it turns in bothdirections. You will note how two out of the governing planets of the decanatesin the case of the ordinary wheel serve to enhance the planetary rulers of thesign, Gemini with Saturn offering at a certain fairly advanced stage theopposition needed to bring about a basic revolution. Note this phrasing. Theentire question of the revolving wheel with its dual action and its dual effectupon consciousness (and therefore the whole problem of the three decans andtheir rulers in each sign of the zodiac) must remain a difficult and abstruseproblem until [370] such time as astrologers have developed a four-dimensionalconsciousness and know the true meaning of the Biblical phrase: the “wheelturning upon itself.” In reality, the wheel does not turn like a wheel in a careither forward or the reverse. It turns every way and both ways simultaneously.This fact is, as yet, an impossible one for the human consciousness to grasp.The complexity involved in the progress through the decans—conditioning also therulers—is to be found to be based upon this multiple action of the wheel. Thewheel, therefore, moves not only clockwise, but both ways at once and also atright angles to itself.The obviousness of the meaning of the two Words for this sign requires from meno elucidation. For the ordinary man the Word goes forth “Let instability do itswork” but for the disciple the Word is uttered by the soul itself: “I recognisemy other self and in the waning of that self, I grow and glow.”Fluidity, recognition of duality, soul control! These are the keynotes of thissign, and should be the keynote of your life, for whether you are in this signin this life, it has at some time and many times conditioned your experience,and the results are marked in the life of the advanced disciple.TAURUS, THE BULLWe now arrive at the last of the twelve signs which we have been considering andthe last of those which affect humanity. It is also the second sign which—afterthe reorientation preceding discipleship—produces changes and opportunity forthe disciple. We come also to the sign which is called “the sign of the majorlife incentive,” because Taurus is the symbol of desire in all its phases.Whether the subjective man is impelled by desire, or the disciple is drivenforth upon the path of return by the urge of aspiration, [371] or whether theinitiate is controlled by the will to cooperate with the Plan, he is,nevertheless, being responsive to the most potent manifestation of a littleknown and understood aspect of divinity, to which we give the inadequate name ofthe Will of God.Will, power, desire, aspiration, ambition, motive, purpose, impulse, incentive,plan—all these are words which attempt to express one of the major underlyingattributes and fundamental causes (man scarcely knows which) of manifestation,of the evolutionary processes and of the will-to-be or the will-to-live. Thegreat triplicity of desire—aspiration—direction (will) are only three wordswhich endeavour to describe the progress and bias of man the personality, manthe soul, and man the channel for spirit or life. All three point inadequatelyto the cause of the threefold expression which underlies all events, allprogress and all happenings in time and space.It was the Buddha who clarified for man the nature of desire and its results,with the unhappy effects which desire produces when persistent andunenlightened. It was the Christ Who taught the transmutation of desire intoaspiration which, from the expression given to it in The New Testament , was theeffort of the human will (hitherto animated by, or expressed through, desire) toconform itself to the will of God—this without understanding but conformity, inperfect trust and with the inner assurance that the will of God must be all thatis good, both in the individual and in the whole.Now, as the Shamballa force is beginning to pour into the world, man is seekinganother interpretation of God's will which will not involve the hitherto blindacquiescence and unavoidable acceptance of the inscrutable dictates of a potent,inescapable Providence, but which will produce an [372] understandingcooperation with the divine Plan and an enlightened fusion of the individualwill with the great, divine will and this for the greater good of the whole. Forthis desirable attitude there is worldwide preparation going forward in a simpleand unobtrusive manner through the gradual fomentation of the will-to-goodeverywhere and the demand, so universally voiced, that human conditions may bemore truly enlightened, more acutely polarised for the benefit of the whole andmore definitely subordinated to the innate divine urge for beauty, synthesis andthe free expression of the hidden mystery which is to be found at the heart ofall forms. It is going forward also through the constant attempt to comprehendand interpret the Plan for humanity, as its broad outlines begin to becomeapparent to the developing intelligence of man.This all indicates a growing responsiveness on man's part to the incomingShamballa influences and the consequent evocation of the will aspect of man'snature. This must produce undesirable as well as desirable results on account ofman's present point of evolution and is, therefore, responsible for much that istaking place in the world today. The trembling response of humanity (through themedium of the most enlightened and sensitive people in each country) to thisinfluence and the corresponding magnetic interplay between the great centre atShamballa and the human centre is a steadily growing fact, registered and notedby the watching Hierarchy and making certain major changes inevitable andunavoidable. This augurs well for the future in spite of temporary misuse of theforces. Necessarily and simultaneously, this interplay evokes response from theunprepared and the unready and from the wrongly oriented and the selfishlypolarised person. This stimulates the will-to-power in the individual andfosters personality integration [373] of the wrong kind and its enforceddesires. Thus, through these personalities and their wrong emphasis andteachings, nations also are misled—again temporarily—and the Shamballa force iswrongly employed and directed. The result of this dual effect of the Shamballaforce at the present time is the precipitation of that cleansing but terribleprocess which we call War. This war is the consummation of the conflict betweenthe pairs of opposites and the basic duality of manifestation and is notmotivated basically as have been all previous wars. When I refer to thisconflict I would remind you that to us (the workers on the inner side) the 1914conflict and this one are two phases of one condition.The war, when held in a steady focus by the Guides of the race and when notpermitted to pursue too long and too terrible a course, can most definitelyfurther the ends of evolution by creating situations which foster mentaldevelopment under spiritual guidance, necessitating clear thought (a thing rareto find), the removal of undesirable conditions by their emergence intoprominence and by the consequent removal of their originating sources and alsoby the definite effects produced upon the emotional body of humanity bycorporate suffering and pain. This suffering, deprivation, anxiety and distresscan lead to a reversal of human orientation upon the wheel of life, just as itdoes in the case of the individual aspirant. It can lead to the focussing of allthe life tendencies upon a world of truer values and reality and thus inauguratethe new and better civilisation for which we all hope. Looking at the worldtoday if you could but see it as we the teachers on the inner side can see it,you would become aware of such a re-focussing and re-orienting on all sides.Again, however, the time element comes in (that brain-conditioned sense ofawareness) and the problem with which [374] the Hierarchy is now concerned is tosee that the present conflict does not persist unduly long , to awaken all thenations, without exception, to a sense of the dramatic import of the presenttime and of their right share and their responsibility and thus to engineer aclimax wherein the correct world lesson may be learnt; whereby the world may bepurified by the elimination of the undesirable elements which hinder the new eraand the upspringing of a more spiritual civilisation; and whereby the forces ofhate, of cruelty, of materialism and of darkness may be driven back (whereverfound) before the sweeping onslaught of the Forces of Light.It might be here pointed out that just as the Aquarian Age is coming intomanifestation for our planet as a whole, bringing in its wake universalawareness and the new modes of expressing world synthesis, human interests andthe world religion, so humanity, the world disciple, is beginning to come underthe influence of Taurus. It is this influence which will bring about at thistime the reversal of the wheel of life for those in the human family who areready (and their numbers are now very great). This is happening and the resultsare inevitable and cannot be evaded. The great question is: Will this Taurianinfluence, increased as it is by the incoming Shamballa forces, produce thefloodlight of illumination of which Taurus is the custodian, or will it simplyfoment desire, increase selfishness and bring humanity to the “fiery heights ofself-interest” instead of to the mountain of vision and initiation?This is the situation which confronts the Knowers of the race in their variousgrades of knowledge and illumination at this time. Neither of theseinfluences—the Taurian or the Aquarian—can be avoided. As you will see when westudy the analysis of this sign and come to a consideration of its rulers,Taurus forges the instruments of constructive living[375] or of destruction; it forges the chains which bind or creates the keywhich unlocks the mystery of life; it is this forging process, with itsconsequent clamour, which is going on at this time in a most potent manner.Vulcan controls the anvil-like processes of time and strikes the blow whichshapes the metal into that which is desired, and this is true today as neverbefore.He it is who is forging the way for the coming Avatar Who will—at the rightmoment—come forth, embodying in Himself the Will of God which is the divinewill-to-good, to peace through understanding, and to right relations between menand between nations.The Taurian influence must now be regarded as being of exceeding potency today,particularly from the angle of the subjective spiritual values; it is Tauruswhich is the ruler and the guiding influence of that which is occurringeverywhere.I would like here to call your attention to the fact that this sign is asynthetic sign in the sense that it brings expression of an inner urge of somedefinite nature upon the physical plane. This it does, because its basic qualitydemonstrates as desire in the mass of men and as will or directed purpose in thedisciple or the initiate. It manifests as stubbornness in the average man (andthis is literally wilful adherence to personality aims) or as intelligentlyexpressed will—actuated by the impulse of love—in the advanced man. Thisconnotes adherence to soul purpose. People who are Taurians naturally and bynatal inclination would do well to consider this statement and thus test alltheir major determining activities by the question: Is my present attitude, mywork or intention actuated by personality desire or am I working and planningdirectly under soul urge and incentive? This should give the keynote of allTaurian [376] problems. The entire secret of divine purpose and planning ishidden in this sign, owing fundamentally to the relation of the Pleiades to theconstellation, the Great Bear, and to our solar system. This constitutes one ofthe most important triangles in our entire cosmic series of relationships andthis importance is also enhanced by the fact that the “eye of the Bull” is theeye of revelation. The underlying goal of the evolutionary process—“the onwardrush of the Bull of God,” as it is esoterically called—reveals steadily andwithout cessation the stupendous and sublime plan of Deity. This is the subjectwhich light reveals.There is at this time, owing to the influx of the Shamballa force, theestablishing of a peculiar relation or alignment between the constellation,Taurus (with its own specific alignment with the Pleiades and Great Bear) theplanet, Pluto, and our Earth. This produces much of the present world difficultyand one which the modern astrologer would do well to consider. It constitutes amajor cosmic triangle at this time, conditioning much that is now happening.This Shamballa force is that which “fans or intensifies the light by the removalof obstructions and proceeds from far distant places, pouring through the eye ofillumination into those spheres of influence upon the sorrowful planet, theEarth, impelling the Bull upon its onward rush.” So speaks the Old Commentary .The import of this is that the energy of will—newly released by Sanat Kumaraupon our planet—emanates, via the head centre of the planetary Logos, from theGreat Bear; it is stepped down in vibration via one of the Pleiades (hence itsinfluence upon matter and hence also its pronounced Taurian effects uponhumanity) and so enters into the solar system. It is there absorbed by thatmajor centre of our planetary life to which we give the name, Shamballa. Itseffect is necessarily twofold. It produces in [377] certain nations, races andindividuals, a welling up of the self-will or of the will-to-power which ischaracteristic of the developed lower nature, the personality aspect ofintegrated selfhood. It produces—though less readily—a stimulation of thewill-to-serve the plan as it is grasped by the world aspirants, the worlddisciples and initiates. Thus are the purposes of Deity materialised.Owing to the world glamour, the true purpose and ideal set before our planetaryforces by the all-creating Will becomes distorted by many people. They are notpolarised in the divine will but are as yet centred in their personalities andhence only the few appreciate the beauty of the intended group life, grouppurpose and group fusion. Group living tends to the fulfilment of free will inservice and a free subordination of the lower will to the higher purpose ingroup formation. Through the glamour contacted, however, this group activity andlife becomes twisted into the imposed will and the concept of the super-state.This produces the imprisonment of the mind and the curtailment of all freedom,all free thought and free will. The man becomes the captive of the man-madestate. This gives a clue to much that is happening today and to the headstrongprogress of the glamoured peoples, to the stiffening of individuals in theirseparative, wrong idealisms and to their acceptance of the imposition of a ruleof life and an order of living which is imposed upon them by force and which isnot the free expression of a free people.The same force, secondly, brings to other peoples and individuals a measure ofillumination—an illumination which reveals the underlying synthesis, whichindicates the dualism which must finally vanish and which indicates also thesecret of right human relations. One reaction produces the onward rush of thematerialistic systems of life, thought and desire, [378] dashing blindly forwardin the force of their own momentum and producing a stage of powerful expressionand active movement; the other demonstrates in a far vision of possibility and asteady movement forward in spite of the immediate dangers and difficulties.The Bull, therefore, in expression is dual. Today we see the wilful dash of thelower nature of humanity, embodied in the forces of aggression, and thepurposeful progress of those people and peoples who seek, even if without fullunderstanding, to work out the plans of God, proceeding in spite of each other.That is as far as the evolutionary processes have yet taken humanity and hencethe critical situation now to be found. The question is: Will the Bull of desireor the Bull of divine illumined expression succeed?This sign is an earth sign and hence the working out of the Plan or thefulfilment of desire must be carried out upon the outer plane of living. Thiswill or desire must express itself in the plane of outer living and in theenvironment whether it is the environment of an individual man, of a nation orof a group of nations.As you know, astrologers have long pointed out that this sign concerns thephysical body among other factors, and the health or wholeness of the body isclosely connected with the expression of past desire or of present idealism andthis is a point to be borne in mind. Today, the cure or care of the physicalbody is of paramount importance to practically everybody and the thoughts of allpeoples without exception, whether at war or not, are turned that way. Theemphasis upon the wholeness of the individual physical life is symbolic of theouter body of humanity, viewing all human beings as a unit.Again, gold is the symbol which today governs man's desires whether national,economic or religious; it is connected [379] with this sign and this is one ofthe indications that today the conflict in the world economic situation is basedupon the upwelling of desire. In an esoteric way, therefore—quoting from a veryancient book of prophecy:“The golden eye of Taurus points the way to those who likewise see. That whichis gold will some day, too, respond, passing from East to West in that dire timewhen the urge to gather gold shall rule the lower half (i.e., the personalityaspect of men and of nations—A.A.B.). The search for gold, the search for goldenlight divine, directs the Bull of Life, the Bull of Form. These two must meet;and meeting, clash. Thus vanishes the gold....”The earthly triplicity of Capricorn, Virgo and Taurus form a triangle ofmaterial expression which is of profound interest as one studies it either fromthe angle of the ordinary round of the zodiac, followed by average andundeveloped humanity, or from the angle of the disciple wherein the path ofzodiacal progress is reversed.In the first case, Capricorn marks the point of greatest density and concreteexpression and shows the life divine as deeply imbedded in substance. This isthe true state of death as far as the life is concerned; it is captivity inform. In Virgo, however, that life makes its inner pressure felt and themovement—faint yet real—of the hidden life begins to pulsate within the concreteform, producing in Taurus that reaction to desire and that onward rush andpowerful movement which distinguishes the evolutionary progress of theindividual, working under the impulse of desire. Forget not, that the firstthrill or response of the Christ life is to the pull, urge or suggestion of theform nature wherein it finds [380] itself. Then later, when all the resources ofthe form nature (drawn out through desire), are exhausted and the Christ life isexceedingly strong and ready to reveal itself through the death of the Mother,the form, then and not till then is the progress of the wheel arrested and“revolution” takes place with the life aspect reversing itself upon the wheel.Then the disciple (an expression of the Christ life in its early manifestedstages), having transmuted desire into aspiration, begins his career—objectivelyand in full consciousness—in the sign Taurus and “on the wings of aspiration”proceeds towards Virgo and “being both the Mother and the Child enters into theHouse of Labour.” From that house, the disciple in due time arrives at Capricornwhere he finally subdues matter, form or concrete expression to divine uses andpurposes, and thus demonstrates the triumph and the potency of the Christ life.The secret of the Triangles or triplicities in their fourfold expression is asyet an unexplored aspect of astrological research and one with which we willlater concern ourselves.This sign Taurus is, therefore, the eleventh sign upon the ordinary wheel ofexoteric emphasis and life, preceding each new cycle of incarnated expression.As the individual descends into incarnation and when he takes an astral shell,he definitely comes into a Taurian cycle, for it is desire which impels torebirth and it takes the potency of Taurus to bring this about. As this subjectconcerns the astrology of the astral vehicle we will not deal with it furtherfor that is a phase of research for which humanity is not yet ready.This sign is also the second subjective sign on the reversed wheel, preparatoryto the conscious recognition of the right relation of the dualities in Gemini.Ponder on this. In this sign we have consequently the following qualities oraspects in juxtaposition: [381]1. Desire—leading to aspiration upon the reversed wheel.2. Blindness—leading eventually to sight.3. Darkness—leading finally to light.4. Death—leading at last to liberation.In the last analysis, we come back to the eternal dualities, leading as theyever do to the interplay of the polar opposites, to the cyclic ebb and flow ofthe inner life and the outer periphery of expression, and to that attraction andrepulsion which leads to a steady shift of the attracting force to an everhigher and wider appeal. It is the secret of eventual synthesis, which is thefinal illumination, seen through the eye of Taurus. It is for this reason thatthis sign is regarded as being one of universal movement, of great and constantactivity under the impulse of material desire or the urge of the divine will,when recognised and sensed. The triangle of expression is one of potentenergies:1. Desire . . . . . . . . . . . . aspiration . . . . . . . . . . . will. 2. Man. . . . . . . . . . . . . the disciple . . . . . . . . . . the initiate. 3.Materiality . . . . . . . . duality . . . . . . . . . . . . . divinity. 4. Form. . . . . . . . . . . . Soul . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Spirit. 5. Humanity .. . . . . . . . Hierarchy . . . . . . . . . . Shamballa.I ring these changes constantly as the consideration of them, intelligentlygrasped, will lead eventually and inevitably to their fusion in your individualconsciousness.It is not my intention to say much here anent the Fixed Cross of which Taurus isone of the arms. I dealt with this in several places when considering with youthe constellations Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius. I would, therefore, refer you tomy earlier comments. Scorpio is, as you will have realised, the dominant armthrough which the most effective potency flows upon the reversed wheel, whereadvanced humanity is concerned because it is the testing sign for humanity and[382] the one in which the human being reaches the depths or attains theheights. Taurus is the dominant stream of energy upon this Fixed Cross whereaverage man is concerned. The energy let loose through this Cross is stupendousin its effects, producing finally the great reversal and renunciation. In thisCross, Taurus is the Initiator for it “impulses the Will,” producing movementand momentum. You have (if I may repeat earlier implications) the followingconditions and correspondences in connection with the three Crosses:1. The Cardinal Cross . . . Spirit . . . . Will . . . . . . . . . . . Shamballa.2. The Fixed Cross . . . . . Soul . . . . . Consciousness . . . Hierarchy. 3.The Mutable Cross . . . Form . . . . Activity . . . . . . . . Humanity.The initiate is one who is in process of relating consciously and effectivelyall these three within himself. Man the essential triangle of energy, man thesquare, man upon the Cross, and finally, man the five-pointed star! In thesefour simple symbolic forms lies the whole history of the fourth kingdom innature. The triangle and the star are subjective expressions of a fixedconsciousness, focussed in reality, whilst the square and the Cross areobjective expressions of the man focussed outwardly.We come now to a brief study of the Rulers of this sign. As Taurus is so close,esoterically speaking, to the sign Aries which—in this world cycle—is the signof beginning, it constitutes, relatively speaking, a very complex aggregation offorces, being related not only to Aries with its cosmic contacts, but also tothe Pleiades and the Great Bear. Yet at the same time, it is very simple in itsexpression for it is governed by only two planets. Venus is its exoteric rulerand Vulcan its esoteric and hierarchical ruler. We touch upon one of themysteries of the Ageless Wisdom. Venus [383] holds a unique relation to theEarth, different to that of any other planet and this, therefore, brings about amuch closer relation between Taurus and the Earth than perhaps exists in anyother zodiacal relation where our planet is concerned. In saying this, I mean inthis particular world cycle and at the peculiar stage of evolutionary unfoldmentat which mankind now finds itself. All is in a state of flux and change; as manunfolds his consciousness, other constellations may come into pronouncedactivity in conjunction with the controlling sign and still others may becomemore remote in their contact and effect. Today, however, Taurus, Venus and theEarth have a very close karmic relation and a very definite dharma to work outtogether . Just what that karma and relationship may prove eventually to be liesbeyond ordinary human understanding but some idea of it may be gained byrelating in your mind the words: Will, Desire, Light and Plan. In voicing itthus, I but step down and distort the relation, but until men can think insimple symbols and without words and can interpret these hitherto unrecognisedsymbols correctly, more it is not possible to add.To understand the relation of Venus and the Earth, I would have you ponder onwhat I earlier gave in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire .The entire relationship has been summed up in the words: The planet Venus is tothe planet Earth what the higher Self is to the Personality. Remember that theplanet Venus is one of the seven sacred planets whereas the Earth is not. Thisstatement involves, as you can see, a deep mystery of relativity, of interplayand of eventual revelation. This revelation as to the relation of the Earth'salter ego to the world of human life will only be revealed at the thirdinitiation, at which time all glamour and illusion is dissipated [384] and “thelight which shines through the eye of the Bull will be unimpeded” and carrylight into the darkness.Venus connotes in our minds, even if we have only a glimmer of occult truth,that which is mental, that which concerns final sublimation, that which dealswith sex and that which must work out into symbolic expression upon the physicalplane. These are the major concepts which enter our minds when Venus and Taurusare considered in unison. These factors of expression have ever been related tothese two since the night of time, because they are essentially basic andeternally cosmic in their implications. Taurus is one of the signs which veils acertain divine mystery. For the sake of disciples in training, these fourconcepts have been briefly summed up in an archaic writing of greatsignificance. This writing states:“The holy Sons of Mind embraced the two. They saw and understood. Thus was sexborn and thus the great mistake was made. The mind was outward turned. The formappears to view and not the life.“Out of the dark, they cried aloud, the holy Sons of Mind. In pain, they criedaloud. They inward looked and knew the error they had made but knew not what todo.... The Lord replied and gave to them the sign of resurrection.”Do you grasp the significance of this statement, and its fundamental simplicity?Let me give you a hint. The earthy triplicity has been designated by astrologersas embodying the idea of plains (Taurus), of caves (Virgo) and of rock(Capricorn). It might be stated that these caves exist in the rocks, deep underthe plains. I am speaking figuratively and symbolically. Out of the rocky cave,the Christ emerged [385] and walked again upon the plains of Earth and from thattime “the woman knew Him not.” Form had no further hold upon him for He hadovercome it in the depths. Into the cave of Initiation, the light ofresurrection streams when the stone at the entrance is rolled away. From life inthe form to the death of the form—deep in the rocky place, down in the crypts ofthe Temple—the human being goes. But into that same place, the new life streams,bringing fresh life and liberation; old things pass away and the darknessbecomes light.Sex is then seen to be in truth only the relation of the lower nature to thehigher Self; it is then lifted up into the light of day in order that man mayreach complete union with divinity. Man discovers that sex (which has hithertobeen a purely physical function, carried on sometimes under the impulse of love)is elevated into its rightful plane as the divine marriage, carried out andconsummated upon the levels of soul awareness. It is this great truth which liesbeyond the sordid story of sex expression, of sex magic and the distortions ofmodern Tantric magic. Humanity has stepped down the symbolism and in itsthoughts debased sex to an animal function and failed to lift it up into therealm of symbolic mystery. Men have sought through physical expression toproduce the inner fusion and harmony which they crave and this cannot be done.Sex is but the symbol of an inner duality which must be itself transcended andwrought into a unity. It is not transcended by physical means or rituals. It isa transcendence in consciousness.The esoteric ruler of Taurus is Vulcan, the forger of metals, the one who worksin the densest, most concrete expression of the natural world (from the humanangle). He is the one who goes down into the depths to find the material uponwhich to expend his innate art and to fashion [386] that which is beautiful anduseful. Vulcan is, therefore, that which stands for the soul, the individual,inner, spiritual man; in his activity we find the key to the soul's task uponthe eternal round of the wheel of life. You will remember how Hercules upon theFixed Cross had to fashion his own weapons before he succeeded in the struggle.This is in reality a reference to the art of Vulcan who rules the inner man andguides his fashioning.Vulcan also rules nations at a certain stage of embryonic soul expression, suchas the present, and governs their activities, fashioning the instruments of warwhen war and conflict are the only means whereby liberation can come, though woebetide those through whom wars come. Vulcan then takes hold and—since the MiddleAges—has brought the mineral kingdom, “the depths from which supply must come,”under human control. In the present war, Vulcan is concerned along with Venus inthe relation of man to man, and of man to the mineral kingdom. Venus, the mentalenergy of humanity, establishes relation between man and man, between nation andnation whilst Vulcan establishes relation between the fourth kingdom in natureand the first. Vulcan, as we shall see later, is governed by the first ray, andthe first ray and the first kingdom are definitely bound together. This,therefore, brings in the Shamballa force and you consequently have an esoterictriangle of energy—will, humanity and the mineral kingdom. They have a veryclose rapport with each other, both from the angle of the Plan and from theexpression of material selfishness. Hence the great use of minerals (iron,copper, etc.) in the World War II. It is literally a war in which the mineralkingdom is used against the human. Humanity had gone down into the caves and thedepths of concretion and is ready now for an upward shift or move, this timeconsciously taken [387] and taken all together. This is a most difficultsituation for the average man to comprehend but the entire problem of theconscious use of that which exists upon the planet and also its destructiveusage is tied together into one most critical situation. Part of the solutionwill come along similar lines and of this the prophecy now coming into theracial awareness that there are those “who sleep in the caves of the earth whowill arise and bring liberation” has reference. But be not too literal ininterpretation for “that which is of the earth can also be found in the sky.”Hierarchically also the ruler is Vulcan, conditioning the planet and determiningthe fact that man is the macrocosm of the microcosm and that the fourth kingdomfashions or conditions all subhuman kingdoms.It is the subjectivity of this sign which makes the understanding of it sodifficult. It will not be until humanity has grasped the nature of the will thatthe true significance of the Taurian influence will be grasped. Both the sign,Aries, and the sign, Taurus, are concerned with the initial impact of energyupon form or of energies upon the soul. Man today is becoming slowly aware ofthe distinction to be found between the opposites and is grasping vaguely thetrue nature of desire. But he is still in the vale of illusion and—whilstthere—cannot see with clarity. One of the first opposites which the disciple hasto grasp is that of the subjective and the objective worlds.Three signs are also closely connected with initiation. The hidden secret ofAries, Taurus and Gemini is revealed at three successive initiations:1. The secret of Aries is the secret of beginnings, of cycles and of emergingopportunity. At the third initiation, the initiate begins to understand the lifeof the spirit or the [388] highest aspect; until that time, he has expressedfirst the life of the form and then the life of the soul within that form. Thisexperience is of so high a nature that only those who have passed through itcould in any way comprehend anything I might say.2. The secret of Taurus is revealed at the second initiation by the suddenremoval or disappearance of world glamour in the blinding energy of light. Thisconstitutes the final radiant activity which consummates the play of the Taurianforce upon humanity during the long and cyclic journey to which man iscommitted. The individual enacts on a tiny scale what humanity—as a whole—willenact when it takes initiation in Taurus.3. The secret of Gemini has to be grasped at the first initiation because it isthe mystery of the relation of Father, Mother and Child. The birth of theChrist-child upon the physical plane is the consummating glory of the Geminiforce.All this concerns the subjective energies which express themselves through themedium of the personality or form aspect. When, therefore, I speak of subjectiveenergies, I refer to the forces pouring from the soul (on soul levels) into theform nature upon its own level of awareness. I could illustrate this by pointingout that desire is not (from the angle of reality) a subjective quality exceptin so far as it is a distortion or a glamorous use of the energy of will. Desireis the force of the form nature; will is the energy of the soul expressingitself as direction, progress, and conformity to the Plan. This Plan, from thestandpoint of the individual, is as much of the sensed will of God as he can, atany particular stage in his experience, grasp and understand. These distinctionsalso merit consideration. The [389] average human being may consider desire assubjective because he is so completely identified with form life upon the outerplanes that the impulses and incentives coming to him along the stream ofconsciousness are viewed by him as intangible and mystical. Yet they are inreality but form radiations and reactions and are not truly and technicallysubjective at all. The high call of duty, the sense of responsibility are trulysubjective in nature for they come from the soul and are the response of thesoul to the pull of the form. Gradually, the disciple learns to distinguishbetween these distinctive aspects of energy and force which impinge ceaselesslyupon his consciousness. As time goes on, his analysis becomes ever more acuteand more discriminating until he knows finally which is an expression of force(coming from the form) and which are energy contacts (coming from the soul).This digression was necessary at this point because it is essential thatesoteric astrologers should realise that these three signs, Aries, Taurus andGemini are (from the standpoint of the disciple and initiate) purely subjectivein their effects within the life of these signs. They can only find outwardexpression in the life of the subject and be consciously directed and controlledin Cancer, thus leading to the great liberation which takes place in the polaropposite to Cancer, Capricorn and also in Aquarius and Pisces. This of courserefers to effects upon man upon the reversed wheel. In a certain sense these sixsigns constitute two major triangles of force.I have here indicated to you the higher or spiritual aspect of King Solomon'sseal. When these six types of energy are fused and blended and so form oneunity, you will then find emerging the “Star of Christ.” This is one of thesymbols of the sixth initiation and is the inner correspondence [390] of thestar with which you are familiar. In order to understand this more clearly Iwould point out to you that:1. That which is begun or “entered into” at the first initiation is consummatedand completed in Pisces.2. That which impelled to the processes of involution and evolution (the desireto incarnate) takes form at the second initiation in the will-to-liberation inTaurus and finds itself released through the will-to-serve—universally—inAquarius.3. That which is fluid and changeable in Gemini produces the great shift inconsciousness which distinguishes the initiate from the disciple. This, at thethird initiation becomes a fixed attitude in Capricorn. The concrete form lifeis transcended and the inner man reorients and assumes an unchangeabledirection.[Image00008.jpg]You might here ask why I deal here with these abstractions? I would reply, thatin your effort to understand and to grasp the truth which lies beyond yourreason (even when regarding it as a hypothesis hereto unproven) you aregradually developing an aspect of your mind which is much needed in theprocesses of realisation, and which must be called into effective service duringinitiation. Such an effort [391] is needed if true understanding is to occur;initiation is the demonstration of intuitive understanding put to practicalexpression.As we resume our initial theme, I would call your attention to the fact thatthrough the exoteric or orthodox planet, Venus, this sign Taurus is related toGemini, Libra and Capricorn. It is of interest to note that Taurus is,therefore, related to the Mutable Cross by a linking stream of energy, viaVenus, but is at the same time linked in a dual sense with two arms of theCardinal Cross, by a Venusian connection with Libra and Capricorn. There istherefore to the true Taurian who reaches illumination one link with the bodyand soul aspects of expression and two links with soul and spirit—the higheroctave of manifestation. Thus is shown the perfection of the sublimationprocess, for aspiration has entirely superseded desire as a motivating agency.The soul is linked with form but its major link is with the spirit. It is forthis reason that in Taurus, the man comes to the point wherein the real goal orthe true vision appears. Desire in its lowest expression is linked with the formin Taurus. Aspirational idealism in its highest possible expression is alsoachieved in Taurus. Aspiration is linked, however, in its lowest expression withthe soul and in its highest with spirit. Self-will relates man to form; the willof God relates the soul of the man to the spirit. It takes three initiations tomake this clear to the disciple.Looking at the matter from another angle: Venus, the mind or the soul in Librareveals to man the exoteric significance and results of desire. In Gemini, Venusreveals the desire of the pairs of opposites for each other for this is theunderlying theme of the entire creative and evolutionary process—the interplayof the opposites. In Capricorn, Venus reveals to man that desire for the whole,for the universal, [392] which is the hallmark of the initiate and the trueexpression of the spiritual life.When we come to a consideration of the esoteric ruler of Taurus, we findourselves confronted by Vulcan, one of the veiled and hidden planets and onewhich is, therefore, little known or understood. I have earlier referred toVulcan as the Fashioner of divine expression. In a peculiar sense, the energywhich streams from Vulcan is fundamentally the strength and potency which setsthe world evolutionary process in motion; it embodies also the energy of thefirst ray, that force which initiates or begins and that which also destroys,bringing about the death of the form in order that the soul may be set free.Vulcan is the ray or planet of isolation for, in a peculiar sense, it governsthe fourth initiation wherein the depths of aloneness are plumbed and the manstands completely isolated. He stands detached from “that which is above andthis which is below.” There comes a dramatic moment when all desire isrenounced; the will of God or the Plan is seen as the only desirable objectivebut as yet the man has not proved to himself, to the world of men or to hisMaster whether he has the strength to move forward along the line of service.There is revealed to him (as there was revealed to the Christ at the fourthgreat initiatory crisis in His life) some definite, active undertaking whichembodies that aspect of the will of God which it is his peculiar function toappropriate and make possible of expression. This has been called in theChristian phraseology, “the Gethsemane experience.” The Christ, kneeling besidethe rock (symbolic of the depths of the mineral kingdom and of the activity ofVulcan, the fashioner), raises His eyes upward to where the light of revelationbreaks forth and knows at [393] that moment what it is He has to do. Such is thetest of Vulcan, ruling Taurus, of the soul, ruling desire, of the Son of God,fashioning His instrument of expression in the depths, grasping the divinepurpose and so bending the will of the little self to that of the greater Self.The depths have been reached and there is no more to be done. The light from theeye of the Bull which with ever increasing radiance has guided the strugglingsoul must give place eventually to the light of the Sun, for Vulcan is asubstitute for the Sun; it is spoken of sometimes as being veiled by the Sun andat others it stands for the Sun itself. It stands between the man and the Sun,the soul. Therefore, we have in this connection three symbols of the light:1. Taurus.—The eye of illumination or light. The Bull's eye. Illumination.Exoterically—the physical Sun.2. Vulcan.—The one who reveals that which is deeply hidden and brings it up intothe light. Esoterically—the heart of the Sun.3. The Sun.—The great Illuminator. Spiritually—the central spiritual Sun.Thus from every angle, illumination remains the theme of this sign.We have somewhat considered the rays and their effect and relationship as they,through Taurus and its rulers, pour their force and energy into individual man,or into humanity as a whole. The two rays which directly affect the sign are, aswe have seen, the fifth (through Venus) and the first (through Vulcan). Thesetwo when viewed in combination with the Earth (which is an expression of thethird ray) demonstrate a most difficult combination of rays, for all are alongthe line of the first Ray of Energy: [394]Ray 1.—The ray of Will or Power.Ray 5.—The ray of Concrete Knowledge.Ray 3.—The ray of Active Intelligence.This combination tremendously increases the already difficult task of theTaurian subject. Only indirectly does the second Ray of Love-Wisdom and itssubsidiary line of energies appear and, therefore, love and wisdom are oftennoticeably lacking in the person born in this sign. Such a man will have muchself-love, self-esteem, self-respect and a good deal of selfish centralisationor personality focus. He will be intelligent but not wise; aspirational but atthe same time stubborn and set so that his aspiration does not take him very farvery rapidly. He will move spasmodically and in wild rushes; steady measuredprogress upon the Way is very hard for him. He finds it difficult to applypractically the knowledge gained. It is apt to remain a mental acquisition andnot a practical experience. He will be almost painfully conscious of dualitybut, instead of its producing a struggle for unity, it produces often a set andstatic depression. He will be destructive because “bull-headed” and because thehammer aspect of Vulcan will be dominant. Because he has a measure of light—hispower to be thus destructive will distress him.He needs to grasp the spiritual side of Venus which emphasises that the Son ofGod who is the Son of mind is the instrument of God's love; he must learn,therefore, to transmute knowledge into wisdom. He must transcend the destructiveside of Vulcan and so of the first ray and instead work as a “fashioner ofsouls,” including his own. He must aim at clear seeing, pure joyful will and thedeath of personality desire. Such is the goal of the Taurian disciple. [395]Through the three other arms of the Fixed Cross and their three streams ofdivine energy, the force of love can he brought indirectly to bear upon the manborn in Taurus. The rulers of two of these signs, Leo and Scorpio, include theSun (second ray), Mars (sixth ray) and Mercury (fourth ray). The Sun and Marsare esoteric rulers of Leo and Scorpio and Mercury is the hierarchical ruler ofScorpio. Uranus is the orthodox and Jupiter the esoteric ruler of Aquarius. TheMoon is also present but again veils Vulcan, whose influence we have alreadyconsidered. The only ray influence lacking is that of the third ray andbasically that is present also as it is the ray of Earth. Therefore, in thisimportant sign, the Taurian person is under the influence—directly orindirectly—of all the seven rays for the reason that desire, leading to finalillumination, motivates them all. Such is the amazing situation which faces theman—particularly the disciple or the initiate—who is born in this sign. Suchconstitute the difficulties with which he is confronted but such also bringabout his immense opportunity for progress.It will be apparent to you that a whole new field of study will open before theastrologers of the New Age and fresh light on this greatest of all sciences willbe available when the investigator can determine the relative age of the personor of the group whose destiny is to be determined and whose horoscope is beingcast. Each of these signs will eventually have to be considered in such casesfrom:1. The angle of the unevolved man who will be centreda. In one or other of his vehicles.b. In the integrated personality, prior to the Path experience.In these, the Mutable Cross controls. [396]2. The angle of the cycle of lives wherein the dualities are recognised and theaspirant is then “reversing himself upon the Wheel.”The Fixed Cross then controls.3. The angle of the initiate.Here the Cardinal Cross is beginning its control.These Crosses are also known as:The Cross of the hidden Christ—The Mutable CrossThe Cross of the Crucified Christ—The Fixed CrossThe Cross of the Risen Christ—The Cardinal CrossThe individual, planetary and cosmic Crosses.To determine these angles will involve among other things a close analysis ofthe qualities of the four energies which play through each arm of the Cross uponhumanity. One aspect of this will eventually determine statistically the averageof the signs governing the various types of men.It has been said that “four energies make a man; eight energies make a Master;twelve energies make a Buddha of Activity.” During this process of “fashioning,”great changes take place in consciousness and there are fundamental changeswrought through this sign which—in combination with its polar opposite,Scorpio—is one of the major conditioning signs of the zodiac. Under its energyimpact, profound disruptions and alterations in character, quality and directiontake place. It is a dangerous sign because the destructive aspects are so easilyover-emphasised and so intelligently applied to circumstance that the career ofthe Bull can be both destructive within its field of contacts and [397] at thesame time self-destroying until such time that self-will or selfish desire istempered by aspiration. Aspiration eventually gives place to intelligentactivity and the acceptance of the will emanating from the spiritual Centre oflife. This leads to cooperation with the Plan in the fullest sense and the endof individual self-centredness. Temper, which is so characteristic of the Bull,must give place to directed spiritual energy, for temper is but energy run wildin the interests of the personality; blindness (for the Bull is blind for muchof its career) must give place to vision and the right focus of the sight andthis will finally dispel the self-engendered illusions and glamours of theaspirant; self-pity, which is the effect of a constant concentration on thefrustration of desire in the personality life, must be succeeded by compassionfor all humanity, and this must be developed into the self-less service of thesalvaging initiate. The task of the Taurian is a hard one for he embodies inhimself, to a marked degree, outstanding limitations as regards the processes ofspiritual evolution; there are, however, no insuperable difficulties and theliberated Taurian is ever a constructive, planning, creative, forward-movingforce; such men are greatly needed in these serious days of re-adjustment andstrain.Taurus, as you know, rules the neck and the thyroid gland. This is essentiallythe region whence must emanate the creative activity of the man who is upon thePath. The throat is a point to which the energy of the sacral centre must belifted so that creation through love and by the will eventually will prove thesublimatory effect of the transference to higher use of the sex energy. Theright use of the organs of speech gives the clue to the processes whereby thedisciple must bring about certain basic changes. The Taurian upon the way ofliberation would do well to employ the [398] method of directed and motivatedspeech of an outgoing and explanatory nature in order to transform himself fromone who goes wilfully on his personality way into a wise cooperator with thePlan. By this I mean that, as man translates his ideals into words and acts, hebrings about transformation, transmutation and eventually translation upon themountain top of Initiation. The results of this creative work of materialisingthe vision must be carried to the point of effectual demonstration in Scorpio inwhich sign the final tests are applied to prove that the energy is flowingfreely and without impediment and obstruction between the throat and sacralcentres; to show that right direction has been achieved and that there is nolonger any fear that the Taurian subject will blunder blindly forward again inhis own self-interest but will, in the future, move intelligently upon the Wayof Liberation—the way that brings about his own release and at the same timesweeps him into those activities which bring about the release of others. InScorpio, the man who has mastered his lessons in Taurus must demonstrate thatcreativity which will work under the inspiration of aspiration and vision andconstructively attempt to express the beauty which all forms intrinsically veil,thus bringing to all revelation of that underlying purpose which motivates allevents and forms. All these aspects of basic change in purpose, interest andorientation must manifest in Scorpio, thus proving the effectiveness of theevolutionary processes undergone in the great repeated transition from Scorpioto Taurus and from Taurus to Scorpio. This cycle of moves constitutes (with thegreater cycle) a rhythm of experience of tremendous moment. These seven signsare pre-eminently life-experience signs. The preceding sign of Aries is the“sign of institution” [399] whilst the four which come after Scorpio prove to besigns of discipleship and initiation. This is on the reversed wheel and theimplications along the same line on the ordinary wheel can easily be applied byyou.It is the recognition of these goals and a grasp of the Taurian problems whichwill make clear to you the position of the planets in this sign. I would remindyou again that the exaltation of a planet in any particular sign, its fallwithin the sphere of influence of a sign as well as the lessening of aparticular planetary influence in any sign cycle (making it what has beentechnically called “in detriment”) is purely symbolic of the effects of energyas it impinges upon the form-nature, meeting resistance or non-resistance,evoking response or non-response, according to the calibre of the planetaryinstrument subjected to the impact. In this sign, the Moon is exalted.Symbolically this means that the form side of life is a powerfully controllingfactor and one with which the man must ever reckon. The Moon is the Mother ofthe form and in this case veils or hides Vulcan—which might be expected. TheMoon, therefore, stands here for the fashioner or moulder of the form, bringingin both the feminine and masculine aspects of form-building, the dual functionsof Father-Mother. This is a point for astrologers to remember. This process ofinterplay brings about two phases of the needed fashioning:1. A process wherein is created a form of great potency in which self-interestand personality aims and desires are the motives bringing about activity. TheMoon and Taurus activity.2. The processes, self-applied by the awakening Taurian, wherein the form natureis fashioned anew and motivated [400] in a different manner and so is “raised upinto Heaven” and thus irradiated and glorified. The Vulcan and Taurus activity.The exaltation of the form, ruled by the Moon, can be traced throughout theentire zodiac and provides in itself an interesting and progressive story withwhich I have not at this time the intention to deal. It is told by the variouswomen who figure in the different constellations and around them some day theastrology of the form will be built. There is Cassiopea, Venus, Coma Berenice,Andromeda and one or two others, as well as Virgo, the Virgin, the mostimportant of them all. I can only indicate here a field of thought and ofastrological investigation hitherto untouched but I have not time for theinterpretation of this vast and profitable field of knowledge. “Our Lady, theMoon” is related to all these and before the great disruption in an earliersolar system which led to the Moon becoming a dead planet, the energies of thesestars and certain of the planets which were produced through their activity,were all focussed in and transmitted by the Moon in a most mysterious yetpowerful manner. Through desire translated into terms of spiritual will, theform is esoterically “exalted” and of this fact the exaltation of the Moon inTaurus is a symbol. To this the ordinary astrological symbol of the Bull's hornstestifies. This is the crescent Moon and also the symbol of the destructivenature of the form life of the Bull. Forget not that in this connection thedestruction or death of the form and the ending of form influence thereby is thegoal of the process which changes desire into aspiration.Uranus, the planet of the hidden mystery and one of the most occult of theplanets “falls” in this sign, producing [401] the accentuation and the sharpdivision between body and soul which is so marked a characteristic of theTaurian subject. It prepares the inner man for the sharp interplay and conflictin the next sign, Gemini. The presence, therefore, of the exalted Moon and thefallen Uranus gives a marvellous picture of man's history during the stage ofpersonality development and power. The task of Uranus, hidden in the depths, isto awaken and evoke the intuitive response of Taurus to an ever-increasing lightuntil such time that full illumination is achieved and also the development ofthe spiritual consciousness—substituting these higher soul aspects for the lowerform reactions. It is interesting to note that in Scorpio, Uranus is exaltedwhich gives indication of the success of the task which the Uranian forcesundertook. Achievement is attained.Mars is in detriment in this sign. Its activity adds constantly to the naturallywarlike nature of Taurus but the potency of the Taurian struggle is so great,esoterically speaking, that the effect of Mars is lost in the larger whole. It“adds to the glamour and confusion and yet holds within itself hope for thestruggling man.”Constantly in this sign comes the emphasis upon struggle. It is a cosmic,planetary and individual struggle, for desire-will underlies the manifestedactivities of the Logos, the planetary Life and of man and also of all forms innature. It is the struggle of that which is deeply hidden in darkness to reachthe light of day; it is the struggle of the hidden soul to dominate and controlthe outer form, the struggle to transmute desire into aspiration and aspirationinto the will to achieve. It is the struggle to attain the goal which anincreasing light reveals. So potent is this struggle that on the ordinary wheelit culminates (prior to the re-entry in Aries of the soul seeking incarnation)by the fixed [402] desire, growing steadily stronger, to follow the wheel ofre-birth; on the reversed progress around the zodiac, the struggle is toovercome and destroy all that has been so laboriously achieved upon the ordinarywheel and to demonstrate in Scorpio (through the terrific tests there applied)that the form no longer controls but that the lessons learnt through the use ofthe form have been retained; the struggle is to achieve initiation in Capricornand thus release the soul from the revolving wheel and achieve final liberationfrom the thralldom of desire and from form control of any kind.This is curiously emphasised by the rulers of the decanates in this sign. Boththe astrologers, Leo and Sepharial, practically and to all intents and purposes,agree in their assignment of planets to govern the triple aspects of the sign.They only vary exoterically on one point for Sepharial gives the Moon asgoverning the second decan whilst Leo gives Venus as ruling the first decan.However, Venus and the Moon are often used interchangeably and both express oremanate the same basic energy of active intelligence in its higher and loweraspects. One expresses intelligent love and the other the intelligence ofmatter; this dual emphasis is concerned with the dominance of the form nature inthe Taurian subject and his release through the Venusian Son of Mind. The Moonor Venus, Mercury and Saturn control the decanates and our consideration ofthese planets in the other signs will have indicated to you their rightinterpretation, both here and elsewhere. Form life, intelligent activity, andintense struggle summarises the Taurian problem, whilst Mercury, the Messengerof the Gods, reminds the struggling man that he must become ever what heessentially is , thus escaping from illusion and entering into light.Keynotes of this sign are, as usual, clear in their implications. [403] Onestates the note of the form aspect, “Let struggle be undismayed.” The Word ofthe form is to take, grasp and go courageously after that which is desired. TheWord of the Soul is, “I see and when the Eye is opened, all is light.” The eyeof the cosmic Bull of God is open and from it light pours radiantly forth uponthe sons of men. The eye of vision of the individual man must likewise open inresponse to this cosmic light. Hence victory is inevitable for the potency ofcosmic energy will unfailingly and in time subdue and re-orient the energy ofhumanity.We have now considered briefly and yet I believe instructively certain of thesubjective influences and significances of the twelve signs of the zodiac. Wehave touched upon their mutual inter-relation and their planetary interplay andhave sought to portray the reactions of humanity to these multiple energies andforces. These forces, pouring out from cosmic sources, find their way into oursolar system, being attracted thereto through analogous quality or—under the Lawof Contradictions or the Law of Contraries—find their way to certain planets.Thus they affect and condition units of life upon each of these receivingplanets. We have seen man incited to progress by the nature of the forces ofdivine attraction and have noted the differing divine qualities which this playof energies evokes in humanity—as well as in all other forms of life. We haveperhaps emphasised almost to the point of bewilderment the vast aggregation ofimpelling energies which play throughout our cosmos; individual man may well bestunned by a sense of his helplessness and his unique futility. But this is onlydue to the relatively undeveloped state of his “receiving apparatus.” When thusbewildered let him remember that potentially he possesses the creative abilityto build and gradually to develop a better mechanism of reception which [404]will enable him finally to be responsive to all impacts and to every type ofdivine energy. This capacity is indestructible and is itself a divine focus ofenergy which must and will without fail carry forward the good undertaken underthe inspiration of The Great Architect of the Universe. He fashions all thingsto a divinely foreseen end and in this sign—through His agents, Venus andVulcan, typifying the form and the soul—will lead man from the unreal to thereal."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III - THE SCIENCE OF TRIANGLESINTRODUCTORY REMARKS[407] We have been working for some time now upon the third part of our study ofthe Zodiac and the Rays. This entire section deals with the nature of esotericastrology and, under our introductory remarks, we considered very briefly thesignificance of esotericism as a whole when applied to modern astrology; weconsidered the three Crosses and referred, again very briefly, to the relationof the signs to the centres; we gave most of our time, however, to an analysisof the meaning and inter-relation of the twelve signs of the zodiac to eachother, to the planets, and to the Earth. We dealt scarcely at all with theireffect upon the individual except in a general sense. Now we begin to take upthe third and most important part of this astrological study, entitled TheScience of Triangles. This study will fall into three parts as I earlierindicated:1. Triangles of Energy—constellations.2. Triangles of Force—planetary triplicities.3. The Triangles and the Centres—planetary and human.I have analysed here the point reached in our studies, as I am anxious for youto know as far as possible just where we stand in our attempt to throw the lightof esoteric understanding [408] upon the present entirely exoteric study ofastrology.Before, however, proceeding with our somewhat difficult theme there are a fewwords I would like to say in reference to our general attitude, and certainthings of which I would remind you.In no place have I attempted to give any of the mathematics connected with mystatements in this series of astrological studies. Certain basic changes in theorientation of the Earth’s axis are now taking place, and these will throw muchconfusion into the computations of astrologers. These changes are proceedingslowly and progressively and according to cosmic law. Whilst they are inprogress, accuracy of computation and deduction is unattainable. When theorientation and “pointed direction” of the Earth’s pole has again beenstabilised, the new conditioning, mathematical figures can be again ascertained.There has indeed been no true accuracy since ancient Egyptian days. Anything nowpossible along these lines can only be regarded as approximate, and, therefore,certainty in analysis, prediction and interpretation is not possible. This wholesubject is one of the greatest obscurity and quite incomprehensible to theaverage astrologer and certainly to the average student. I would remind you,however, that several times in the great life cycle of the Earth, there havebeen changing “pole-stars” and that our present pole-star has not always heldthat position. This science itself recognises.At each of the great shifts in the Earth’s axis, there has been upheaval,confusion and cataclysm, preceding reconstruction, stabilisation and relativequiet. Of these macrocosmic events there are similar microcosmic correspondencesin the lives of both humanity and individual man. Hence the present worldcrisis—though precipitated by human [409] error and sinfulness, by past Karmaand emerging idealism (responsive to the development of the intellect and theappearance of the intuition)—is basically the result of much greater and vastercombinations of force currents in macrocosmic relations.Briefly it might be said that the following cosmic and systemic causes areresponsible for the present world crisis and the present difficult worldsituation:1. A welling up of magnetic force on Sirius, which produces effects upon oursolar system and particularly upon our Earth, via the Hierarchy.2. A shift in the Earth’s polarity, due to the pull of a great cosmic centre.This powerfully affects the Earth’s orientation and is responsible for thepresent earthquakes, and for the volcanic eruptions and the many earthquakesduring the past one hundred and fifty years.3. The great sweep of the sun around the greater zodiac (a period of 250,000years, or a complete round) came to an end when the sun entered Pisces over twothousand years ago. This process of passing out of, or entering into, aparticular sign and cyclic influence covers a period of five thousand yearswhere this greater round or cycle is concerned. This period of five thousandyears covers the complete cycle of transition until complete freedom to functionunder the inspiration of the new sign is completed. We are, therefore, not yetfree from incidental turmoil.4. The passing of our Sun out of the sign Pisces into the sign Aquarius isanother of the conditions bringing about the present confusion. This confusionof forces in the solar system is notably affecting our planet. In the process ofpassing from sign to sign, as for instance [410] transitting out of Pisces intoAquarius as is now the case, the period covered is approximately five hundredyears.These are points which astrologers would do well to consider. I would remindstudents again that when speaking of signs I am referring to the influences ofthe constellations as they are represented by the signs, calling to yourattention that in the great evolutionary process and owing to certain shifts andastronomical-astrological discrepancies, the Sun is not in the constellation towhich a particular sign refers at any given moment. This I called to yourattention in an earlier part of this treatise.5. Another factor little known is that the Moon today is disintegrating withincreasing rapidity and this necessarily affects the Earth and producesterrestrial results.Students would find it of interest to make the following applications of thesegreat cyclic events to their own “appearance” and functioning processes in timeand space:1. The succession of the greater rounds of the zodiac or a period of cycles ofapproximately 250,000 years has a correspondence to the life cycle of the Monad.2. The progress of the Sun as it passes through the signs in the zodiac duringone of these 25,000 year cycles finds its analogy in the life cycle of the egoor soul.3. The lesser zodiac covered—from the angle of extreme illusion—in the course ofone year, corresponds to the life of the personality.In considering these points it should always be remembered that great shifts inconsciousness, or great expansions of awareness, are followed inevitably byupheaval in the outer forms. This is true in the life of the solar Deity, of aplanetary [411] Logos, of humanity as a whole and of a man. Hence again today’sworld problem. A major event such as a change in the axis of the Earth isrelated to an initiation of the planetary Logos. Students can here note,therefore, the relation to the individual life as it shifts its consciousnesssteadily in the vital unfolding processes of the Path of Discipleship and ofInitiation. Earlier in this treatise I referred to a fact which must always beborne in mind and that is that the great energies, playing upon our planet,exert a hindering or a stimulating effect. They are either retarding in theireffects, producing concretion, crystallisation and a holding back or on to thatwhich is old and of the past, or they stimulate and produce fluidity,enlargement and expansion. The careful student of human affairs will note thisas he studies the events which are today passing before his eyes.Speaking with a wide generalisation, it might he said that the three majorgroups of forces affecting our planet are zodiacal, systemic and planetary innature and—again generalising—it might also be said that:1. Zodiacal energies pass through Shamballa and are related to the first Ray ofWill or Power and affect the Monad.2. Systemic energies pass through the Hierarchy and are related to the secondRay of Love-Wisdom or (as it is oft called in esoteric astrology) the Ray ofAttractive Coherency and affect the soul.3. Planetary forces impinge upon and pass through humanity and are related tothe third Ray of Active Intelligence and affect the personality.To this I earlier referred, but have restated it here as I seek to have itdefinitely in your minds as we go forward [412] with our new studies. You havehere a major trinity of energies, emerging out of a vast and incomprehensibleaggregation of forces and energies which stands to them as the One Life standsto this lesser important triangle.It must also be remembered that this triple group of energies produces differingeffects according to the type of mechanism (itself dependent upon the point inevolution and the stage of development) upon which it impinges. The effect, forinstance, of zodiacal and systemic force upon a sacred or a non-sacred planet iswidely distinctive, just as the effect of these energies as they make theirimpact upon man will depend upon whether response is evoked from the monad, theego or the personality, whether they impinge upon the mass consciousness, theself-conscious unit or the illumined consciousness of humanity, or whether infact—as far as man is concerned—they play upon unevolved man, upon evolved manor upon disciples and initiates. The type of mechanism, and the quality of theconsciousness determines reception and response. This is a statement of basicimportance and until astrologers can arrive at the point of development wherethe world of true meaning is open to them and where the scope of theirconsciousness is widely inclusive, it will not be possible for them to be trulyaccurate in their interpretations of group or individual horoscopes. I ambringing this point up as the whole science of Triangles relates entirely tosubjective energies as they condition the consciousness and not to theconditioning brought about by the same energies upon the outer forms upon thephysical plane .You may here rightly remark that “as a man thinketh so is he” and that thisexpression of energy will amount to the same thing in the last analysis. Butthis is not exactly true. The response of humanity or of the individual man[413] to the inner thought life and to the subjective consciousness is notimmediate. It takes much time (especially in the early stages), for an idea towork through into the mind and from thence to the brain, conditioning theemotional nature in its progress and processes. Several lives may, therefore, begiven to the registering of the effects of these energies upon the thought lifeand the response of the physical plane life once they are comprehended. It isfor this reason that I have stated that the Science of the Triangles underliesthe whole system of astrology and is only now in process of revelation. Bear inmind that the effect of these energies which we shall be considering and oftheir triple relationship will be in the realm of ideas and in the world ofconsciousness and its expansion, and will embrace, therefore, the sentientthought life of a solar Logos, of a planetary Logos, of humanity and of man.It will not, therefore, deal with the producing of events except in so far thatall ideas work out into expression upon the plane of manifestation—such workingout being, I again repeat, dependent upon the quality and nature of theapparatus of response, be it a solar system, a planet, the fourth kingdom innature, or a human being.I would add here a sixth reason for the present strain and stress in theresponse of the human family in this world crisis because it is related to theentire question of conscious response to subjective forces, expressingthemselves as ideas and vast thought currents. This is the fact that humanity asa whole is today reversing itself upon the great zodiacal wheel just as theindividual disciple does; the point of reversal and the sign or signs in whichit takes place mark a momentous point of crisis in the life of this kingdom innature, producing upheaval, difficulty and a whole gamut of readjustments,necessitated by the re-orientation. [414] If you add this reason to the otherfive, your will not be astonished that the situation is today almost fantasticin its difficulty and the extent of the involvement.In every triplicity, there are three major qualities manifesting or three basicenergies seeking expression and influence. As he manifests in time and space,man discovers this to be true and to constitute a law in nature, and it might besaid that the task of the disciple is to become consciously aware—like adetached onlooking Observer—of these energies and their expressing qualities asthey function within himself. This he does upon the Path of Probation, the Pathof Discipleship and the Path of Initiation. He has to become aware of:1. The threefold energy which is the personality, and of which the vital body isthe synthetic expression.2. The threefold soul of which the egoic lotus is the expression.3. The triple monad of which a great diffusion in time and space in threestreams of creative energy is the expression.This last definition is somewhat meaningless to the uninitiate but must suffice.There is a manifesting aspect in all these triplicities which is the result of,and conditioned by, the interplay of the three forces. It is their fullexpression and the result of their successful activity.1. In the personality, it is the physical body.2. In the soul, it is the unfolded central bud within the egoic lotus.3. In the monad, it is the “sound which geometrically forces itself into thevision of the beholder”—a deeply esoteric mode of symbolising that which cannotbe expressed or reduced to the tangibility of form.[415] If students will bring this idea to the study and understanding of theastrological triangles and will refuse to lose sight of the related tripleenergies, they will greatly simplify their studies. The microcosm, when known,holds ever the clue to the Macrocosm. The Macrocosm eternally reflects itself inman, the microcosm, and hence man has within himself the possibility and thepotentiality of total comprehension.Therefore, in all the many triplicities which we shall study, we shall findcorrespondences to the monad, the soul and the personality in man; we shall findone line of the triangle embodying determining and dominating force and twolines which—during a particular cycle—are conditioned by it. For instance, youhave an interesting illustration of this in the nature of fire, esotericallyunderstood, in its triple expression in time and space during a cycle ofmanifestation, for—as you know—the Ageless Wisdom teaches that there is:1. Electric fire . . . . . . . will . . . . . . . . . monad . . . . . . .Initiatory fire. 2. Solar fire . . . . . . . . . love-wisdom . . soul . . . . .. . . . Qualificatory fire. 3. Fire by Friction . . . . activity . . . . . .personality . . . . Purificatory fire. Intellectual.I point out this triplicity as it is one which is familiar to you and at thesame time constitutes a good illustration of a basic law.1. TRIANGLES OF ENERGY—CONSTELLATIONS.Lying behind all the many interlocking triangles in our solar system andconditioning them to a very large extent (though today more potentially thanexpressively) are three energies coming from three major constellations. Theyare the emanations from the Great Bear, from the Pleiades and from Sirius. Itmight be pointed out that: [416]1. The energies coming from the Great Bear are related to the will or purpose ofthe solar Logos and are to this great Being what the monad is to man. This is adeep mystery and one which even the highest initiate cannot yet grasp. Itssevenfold unified energies pass through Shamballa .2. The energies coming from the sun, Sirius, are related to the love-wisdomaspect or to the attractive power of the solar Logos, to the soul of that GreatBeing. This cosmic soul energy is related to the Hierarchy. You have been toldthat the great White Lodge on Sirius finds its reflection and a mode ofspiritual service and outlet in the great White Lodge of our planet, theHierarchy .3. The energies coming from the Pleiades, an aggregation of seven energies, areconnected with the active intelligent aspect of logoic expression, and influencethe form side of all manifestation. They focus primarily through Humanity .Connected with this major triangle and affecting powerfully our entire solarsystem is a triple inter-relation of great interest, which has a special andpeculiar relation to humanity. This triangle of forces relates one of thesemajor constellations, one of the zodiacal signs and one of the sacred planetswithin our solar system.First Triangle:The Pleiades . . . . . Cancer . . . . . . . . . . . Venus.Humanity .Second Triangle:The Great Bear . . . Aries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Pluto.Shamballa .Third Triangle:Sirius . . . . . . . . . . Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Jupiter.Hierarchy .[417] I wonder if you can grasp at least partially and symbolically the factthat these triangles must not be thought of as placed , static and eternally thesame, or even as three dimensional. They must be regarded as in rapid movement,revolving eternally in space and ceaselessly moving onward and as of fourth andfifth dimensional extension. There is no way of depicting them or of bringingthem visually to your attention, for only the inner eye of vision can imaginetheir progression, position or appearance. These three major triangles are onlypartially as yet in expression as far as our solar system is concerned and onlyone point of the great triangle—as for instance one point of the GreatBear—constitutes with Aries a related line of force; only one point ofAries—within itself or within its own range of interplay with Leo and Capricorn(see Tabulation VIII) is related to Pluto. Therefore the entire cosmic web andsolar system is an intricate, constantly moving, interwoven series of triangleswherein each point of a triangle emanates three lines or streams of energy (ninein all); it is likewise responsive to and receptive of the energies—likewisetriple in nature—which lie within its periphery or sphere of influence andvibratory activity.It is useless for students to attempt to unravel this aggregation of interlacingstreams of energy. All that is now possible for man with his present equipmentis to accept hypothetically these statements anent certain major triangles whichaffect humanity and seek to prove their effect and to endeavour to arrive atsome understanding of that intricate, interwoven network which he himselfpossesses and to which [418] he gives the name “etheric body.” Thus he maysucceed in proving the accuracy of a statement by the demonstrated quality ofthe life aspect, its conditioning and results in the microcosmic life historyand events. This astrology has nought to do in connection with tangiblehappenings on the outer plane of existence; we, however, will see to it that oureffort lies along the line of psychological life history and events and notalong the line of physical occurrences . This difference is basic and must everbe borne in mind. Astrologers have begun to grasp a dim idea of the interlockingtriangles of energy as far as our Earth is concerned in the rather arbitrarydivision of the twelve constellations into four triplicities, covered by suchqualifying terms as earthy triplicity or fiery triplicity, composed each of acardinal, a fixed and a mutable sign. They thus divide up the entire zodiac intoa fourfold group of interlacing and interrelated triads, each conditioned by oneof the basic elements and thus qualified. These constitute a series of basictriangles with a definite reference to our planetary life. Owing to the constantmovement everywhere, inherent in the solar system and the zodiac—onward,interior and revolving—some idea can be grasped of the intricacy of the entirepattern. A further aid to the grasping of this essential beauty of coordinatedand organised movement and its power to qualify and condition the entireuniversal pattern can be gained by those students who have studied somewhat thevarious triangles to be found in the etheric body of man through theinter-relation of the seven centres to which I have referred elsewhere in myvarious books. These centres, when awakened and alive, are swept finally withinthe radius of each others’ sphere of action; from the point of view of livingenergy, the circumference of these wheels or vortices of force becomes soenlarged that they eventually [419] overlap and touch, presenting on a tinyscale a condition analogous to the contacting and interlocking series oftriangles such as those referred to above.Behind these concepts of the relation existing in time and space between theconstellations of the Great Bear, the Pleiades and the sun, Sirius, and oursolar system, there exists, it must be remembered, an immense series ofinterlocking triangles between the stars which compose these constellationsinteriorly and our solar system. You have, therefore, a relationship between:1. The seven stars, composing the Great Bear.2. The seven stars, composing the Pleiades, sometimes called the seven “sisters”or “wives” of the Rishis or informing Lives of the Great Bear.3. The sun, Sirius.These compose major triangles of force and all are held within the radius of theLife of that Great Being Whose expressed, manifested intention is brought intobeing through the medium of these three related groups and our solar system. Ashinted by me in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , these four groups of starsconstitute the manifested aspect or personality of a great and unknown Life.I seek in this connection to give only a general picture because, with thesecosmic triangles, I have no intention to deal. We will only consider thoseconstellations within the greater zodiac which are known by astrologers to havea definite effect upon humanity and our planetary life.Therefore, in studying these triangles, we will make (for our guidance) certainrules which, under the Law of Analogy, may facilitate our comprehension of theunderlying meaning and truths. [420]1. All triangles studied will be regarded as expressing:a. A major conditioning energy, producing manifestation.This corresponds to the Monad aspect.b. A secondary qualifying energy producing consciousness.This corresponds to the Ego or Soul aspect.c. A lesser expression of force, producing tangibility.This corresponds to the Personality aspect.2. These three energies will be related, therefore, to the three aspects ofmanifested life. These have been termed throughout this treatise: Life, Qualityand Appearance.3. These energies change within themselves and sometimes one will strike thedominating note and sometimes another; sometimes a secondary energy will becomea major conditioning force and sometimes the lesser expression will come to thetop and become, for the cycle, the outstanding characteristic of the triangle.Such cosmic events are governed by a great Law of Expediency, evoked by theevolutionary process and incident also to zodiacal movement and its own interiormathematical conditioning—a subject of such vast dimensions and mystery that noLife within our solar system has more than sensed its significance. The cyclicexpression of life is dependent upon constant mutation and infinitely changingprocesses.4. The statements made by me in this attempt—for it is little more—to indicatethe main lines of approach to the new science of esoteric astrology, may not yetbe capable of any proof. Later on such proof will be available. All that I canask of you at this time is to be [421] interested in the presentation, to striveto see the general picture I am seeking to present and to grasp somewhat therelative synthesis which underlies all manifestation. Starting from that whichis today accepted, be willing to move on from there into new fields ofpossibility and of sensed probability . Time will justify the information I askyou to accept as hypothesis.Next I will deal with an analysis of three groups of triangles which are ofmajor importance to humanity at this time and which follow upon informationearlier given. These groups of triangles emanate energies which reach throughspace to the individual man and, therefore, cannot he ignored. They are:The Great Bear The Pleiades Sirius Transmit energy via Leo . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . Capricorn . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Pisces These transmit energyvia Saturn . . . . . . . . . . . . . Mercury . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Uranus Reaching the following centres Planetary head centre. . Planetary ajnacentre . . . . . . . . Planetary heart From thence to Disciple's head centre .Disciple's ajna centre . . . . . . . Disciple's heart centre and eventuallycontrol The base of the spine. . The throat centre . . . . . . . . . . . thesolar plexusI will also take up with you some of the points and indications which are hintedat in Tabulation IX, relating to the twelve signs of the zodiac, to be found onpage 423. Certain major streams of conditioning energies will be seen related toeach other and to our Earth and these fall into two groups:1. The ray energies which we are told emanate from the Great Bear in seven greatout-raying streams of force. [422]2. The inherent energies of the twelve constellations which blend with the rayenergies, producing the essential dualism of manifested life, and incidentallyare responsible for the peculiar difficulties confronting humanity on the are ofevolutionary experience upon our planet.Again I would repeat that what I shall have to say will be related to presentworld conditions, to humanity and also—for practical teaching and application—tothe life of the individual disciple. Necessarily, these energies have a cosmic,systemic and planetary significance but these no disciple can as yet grasp;personality has to be transcended before even the earlier stages of theunderstanding of these mysteries become possible, and this transcendence issomething you have not yet accomplished but which some day inevitably you will.Once man is impersonal and free from the reactions of the lower self, and hisconsciousness is illumined by the clear light of the intuition, then his “windowof vision” becomes clarified and his sight into reality is unimpeded.Obstructions (always erected by humanity itself) are removed and he sees alllife and form in their true relation and can comprehend, and even occultly“see,” the “passage of the energies.”The relationship of certain rays and cosmic triangles may become clearer to youif the following tabulation is studied with care.NOTE: The seven stars of the Great Bear are the originating sources of the sevenrays of our solar system. The seven Rishis (as They are called) of the GreatBear express Themselves through the medium of the seven planetary Logoi Who areTheir Representatives and to Whom They stand in the relation of cosmicPrototype. The seven [423] planetary Gods manifest through the medium of theseven sacred planets. Each of these seven rays is transmitted into our solarsystem through the medium of three constellations and their ruling planets.TABULATION IX. — A COSMIC SERIES OF INTERRELATED TRIANGLES(The Rays, Constellations and Planets )Ray Planets Constellations Orthodox Esoteric I.

Ceremonial Order Aries Mars Mercury CancerThe Moon Neptune Capricorn Saturn SaturnAt this time, I purpose to trace certain major conditioning streams of energy,as they proceed forth from their emanating source—via certain constellations andplanets—to the Earth and, from within the radius of the Earth, reach theindividual disciple, again via certain major planetary [424] centres. In thisway that great Synthesis (which is qualified Life in appearance ormanifestation) can be seen in definite activity, producing solar, planetary andindividual effects and thus demonstrating that intricate relation which unitesthe human atom to the great Lives Who are the sum total of that which ismanifested.The analogy between the microcosm and macrocosm will, therefore, be helpful, andthe relation of a cell or atom in one of the abdominal organs (for instance) tothe soul on its own plane will illustrate with accuracy a still greaterrelationship and interplay. In this interplay of Lives and Their emanatingstreams of forces and energies and in the major determining life activities ofThat in which all forms—including the human—live and move and have their beingis to be found the inevitability of ultimate achievement, the unalterability oflaw and the expression finally of divine unchangeable Purpose. In theevolutionary effects of this relation of Life to Form is to be found also theundeviating way of an expanding, ever-unfolding consciousness—whether it bemacrocosmic or microcosmic. Hence, the Will of God moves the worlds and the Loveof God determines results.In this consideration of the basic Science of Triangles (I had well-nigh said“in the contemplation of the basic Science of Triangles,” for that is what itnecessarily should be if understanding is to be the real reward of our efforts)the relation of the three basic energies affecting our solar system and thepredominant effect of one of them in any cyclic expression in time and spacemust always be borne in mind. One illustration of this normally emerges in ourminds if it be remembered that in this world cycle in our systemic manifestationit is the second or consciousness aspect (that of the second Logos) which is thedominant [425] conditioning factor, which sets the note for evolutionarydevelopment and which engrosses the attention of the evolving human units. Thisis the case even when other factors are present and active. Therefore, allapproaches to truth and to knowledge must, in this cycle, be in consciousness .In another cycle such an approach may be focussed in the will or even in somealready present but unrealised divine attribute, for which we have as yet noname. All that any man can consequently bring to the comprehension of lifeexperience or to the understanding of such an occult science as the Science ofTriangles is a consciousness which is developed to a certain definite andpersonal point of perception or awareness. This point of perception is itselfdependent upon individual unfoldment and also upon the state of awareness ofhumanity as a whole. This connotes two different though inter-related conditionsof perception.Speaking technically, perception and response or the activity of the perceiving,observing consciousness—carried on through the medium of the mechanism ofresponse—is dependent upon the condition or “aliveness” of the centres or theirquiescence. This is true of a man galvanised into activity through his sevencentres, of a planetary Logos functioning through seven planetary centres, of asolar Logos functioning through still greater centres of vibratory reaction, orstill greater Lives, functioning through an aggregate of solar systems. Uponthis activity and its understanding depends the whole science of astrology; inthis statement I give you a clue which may some day revolutionise the presentapproach to astrology.The twelve signs of the zodiac fall into two groups of signs, and their relatedsynthesis has much to do with the Science of Triangles. They are: [426]1. Seven signs related to the unfoldment of planetary consciousness upon Earthand only incidentally involving the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the HumanHierarchy.2. Five signs related to the unfoldment, in time and space, of the HumanHierarchy. These five signs are of major conditioning importance and may beenumerated as follows:a. Cancerb. Leoc. Scorpiod. Capricorne. PiscesThese five signs are related in the planetary sense to the five great races ofwhich our present race, the Aryan, is the fifth. These five races, under theinfluence of the five signs, produce the externalisations which are called thefive continents—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, America. These five continentsare to the planetary Life what five major endocrine glands are to the humanbeing. They are related to five centres.All these appearances, expressions of qualities and material evidences of lifeare the symbols or outer and visible signs of inner and spiritual realities orof Life, whatever you may mean by that term. For our purposes, we could defineLife as the energy emanating from certain great Lives Who stand behind our solarsystem as its life and source, much as the Monad stands behind the appearance ofa man upon the physical plane or of the soul upon its own level. Man, it mightbe stated, is the expression of seven principles and of the life expression oractivity of five planes. In this 7 + 5 is to be found the clue to the mystery ofthe seven and the five zodiacal constellations.[427] Within this sum total of active, qualified energies, we have (working outtoday) influences and impulses from three major constellations. These pourthrough certain other related constellations and planets into the three majorplanetary centres: Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity. It is with these threecentres I would seek to deal and to them and their inter-relations continuallymake reference. I would ask you to bear in mind that these energies aretransmitted from one point to another, or pass through with transmuting effectfrom one centre to another, thus bearing their own vibratory quality butcarrying also that of the centre of transmission. In the transit of energy froma major centre to a human being and when the energy is finally grounded in thedisciple’s centre, you will notice that it is then a fusion of six energies.These three groups of energies (each of them a fusion of six) make thedominating energies, controlling the human being, to number eighteen; this holdsthe clue to the mystery of the “mark of the beast” which is 666. This is thenumber of the active intelligent man and distinguishes his form nature from hisspiritual nature which is 999. These three lines or streams of energy in man maybe listed as follows:I. Will. Purpose. 11. Love-Wisdom. III. Active Intelligence. Spirit.Consciousness. Form. 1. The Great Bear . . . . . . Sirius . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . The Pleiades. Cosmic. Cosmic. Cosmic. 2.

Personal creativity.[428] A study of this tabulation will demonstrate that there will be found astructure therein of many triangles of force; some of these are cosmic, somezodiacal, others systemic, still others planetary and their reflections in theetheric body of the disciples of the world of all grades. Through the greattriangle of Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity, cosmic, zodiacal and systemicforce is focussed and these three become, in their turn, a macrocosmic triangleof energies in relation to the individual human being upon the planet. You have,therefore, the following lines of transmission of force:Shamballa Hierarchy Humanity Head centre. Heart centre. Ajna Centre. Base of thespine. Solar plexus. Throat.One major centre is here omitted because it is primarily related to the physicalbody and its expression of life perpetuation. That is the sacral centre. Just asthe physical body is regarded by true esotericists as not a principle so thesacral centre is regarded as “a necessary evocation between that which is highand that which is low, and between that which is sounded forth from the centrein the throat and that which replies to a deeply sounded note.”In this connection there is an interesting triangle of energy formed by: [429]1. The egoic lotus.2. The throat centre.3. The sacral centre.This triangle when functioning produces a subsidiary triangle of force which isformed by:1. The throat centre.2. The sacral centre.3. The physical body—symbolised by the organs of reproduction.Let me pause a moment here to point out that in this study of the Triangles itis not possible for us to do more than study certain of the major groups oftriangles and a few of the most important triangles where humanity itself isconcerned. It is of value for human beings to realise that there are otherevolutions and other forms of logoic expression of equal importance to theirown. There is, in truth, a veritable multiplicity of triangles. For the triangleis the basic geometric form of all manifestation and it is to be seen (by thosewho have eyes to see) underlying the entire fabric of manifestation, whether itis the manifestation of a solar system, the manifestation of the zodiacal round,the cosmic triplicities or the tiny reflection of this divine triple whole whichwe call man. When the human being is manifest but is not yet truly manifested,the triangles which symbolise this manifestation are the two eyes and the thirdeye:1. The right eye—the eye of buddhi, of wisdom and of vision.2. The left eye—the eye of mind, of the commonsense and of sight. [430]3. The eye of Shiva—the all-seeing eye, the eye which directs the will andpurposes of Deity.These three are, in reality,1. The eye of the Father—carrying light from the Great Bear.2. The eye of the Son—carrying light from Sirius.3. The eye of the Mother—carrying light from the Pleiades.and it is this latter “light energy” which is necessarily peculiarity activewhen the sign of Taurus is dominant in any planetary and individual horoscope.In some unusual manner (from the human angle), all that concerns the developmentof mankind has been—down the ages—expressed by him in terms of illumination andknowledge, in terms of sight and of the entrance of light, thus leading torevelation and (incidentally) to the true theme of astrological interpretation.From this peculiar angle, therefore, we can approach the great Triangles withwhich we are today concerned and deal also with their significance in terms ofLight. This significance and approach can be summed up in the following stanzasfrom the Old Commentary which—if studied carefully—will throw much light uponthe theme of this particular subject:I.“The sevenfold light of the Father brought from chaos into the ordered day Hispurpose and His plan. The seven supreme Gods bent to this purpose and withunited will ordained the Plan.The Bear and the Lion met together and laid their plans [431] in conformity withthe plan and with the purpose of their controlling Lord. They called on FatherTime (Saturn. A.A.B.) for aid and strength and he responded to their triplecall. To this call likewise the Eternal Youth responded (Sanat Kumara, Lord ofShamballa); He set Himself anew to learn the plan, aided by Father Time yetunaffected by the Lord of Time for He Himself was timeless, though not the Liveswhich He enfolded in His thought and Plan....Then the triple light which came from the Bear in His high place, from Leo inhis lesser place and from Saturn in his little place poured into the planetaryplace of power. Shamballa was informed. The Lord of Life and of the World tookaction....The little one within the greater Whole (the individual human disciple. A.A.B.)likewise responded to the triple light but not until the cycles passed andpassed again. Late in the day of time, Shamballa sent a call, relayed from voiceto voice and rolling forward on the O.M. The disciple, hearing that sound,lifted his head; an impulse from the base mounted in time and space. Leo withinthe heart and head shouted aloud and stood whilst Saturn did his work ... andthus the twain were one.II.The central light of Sirius shone through the eye of the Son; the vision came.The light of wisdom penetrated into the waters and cast the radiance of theHeavens into the depths. At this attractive call, the goddess rose unto thesurface (the fish-goddess, the symbol of Pisces. A.A.B.) and welcomed the lightwithin the depths and grasped it as her own. She saw the Sun, having seen herSon, and from [432] that day the Sun has never left her. There is no darkness.There is always light.And then the heavens within the ring-pass-not responded to the light from Siriuswhich, passing through the sea of Pisces, lifted the fishes into the heavenlysphere (Uranus) and thus a lesser triple light appeared, the radiant sun ofsuns, the watery light of Pisces, the heavenly light of Uranus. This lightdescended on the waiting sphere and lit the galaxy of little lights upon theEarth. A Hierarchy of Light emerged from its own place; the planet was alight.III.The little one upon that little world responded slowly to that light until todaythe little world of men begins to throb in rhythmic unison. Changes are wrought.The cosmic heart, the heart systemic and the little heart of man begin to beatas one and as this beat pulsates with greater strength it blends a lower note(that of the solar plexus. A.A.B.) within itself, removes its harshness and itsnote of fear and thus it ends illusion. And then again the two are one.IV.The seven Mothers blend their light and make it six (refers to the lost Pleiad,A.A.B.) and yet the seven still are there. Their light is different from theother lights. This light evokes response from that which shouts aloud: ‘I am thedensest point of all the concrete world (Capricorn. A.A.B.). I am a tomb; I alsoam the womb. I am the rock which sinks itself into the deep of matter. I am themountain-top on which the Son is born on which the [433] Sun is seen and thatwhich catches the first rays of light.’ To me a Messenger comes forth (Mercury.A.A.B.) and says ‘the Dayspring from on high is on the way, sent by the Fatherto the Mother.’ Upon his way unto this nether star we call the Earth he stoppedat a bright sun where shines the light of love (Sirius. A.A.B.) and therereceived the accolade of love. So thus he brings bright gifts to man. For he isman himself and from these three (The Pleiades, Capricorn, Mercury. A.A.B.) Mantakes a nature which is his today. Son of the Mother, born from the tomb andshowing after birth the light which he has taken from them all.Then to the lower three he turns and to these souls in prison he in time becomesa Messenger. Thus does the Lord of Mercury repeat himself. The Son descendsagain into the place of earth and iron. Again he knows His mother.And thus the little one upon the littlest sphere becomes the greatest God. Fromthe directing centre of his life on Earth he toils and works and carries out thePlan. (The ajna centre is the directing centre. A.A.B.) He too awakens to theneed and from the chosen place (the throat centre. A.A.B.) he utters forth theSound which in time becomes the Word. And then the three are twain and these areOne.”Again and repeatedly, students must remind themselves that we are consideringthe impact of energy upon energy units (all qualified and producing appearance)and with the response of those energy units to the streams of force which reachthem from “the furthest centre.” It is in the development of response to distantpoints of contact and [434] emanating sources of energy that the neededsensitivity is produced. Sensitivity, generally speaking, is of a threefoldnature:1. Sensitivity to that which is found within oneself. This, when theconsciousness is adequately self-sufficient, opens a door for the entrance ofenergies coming from the “middle centre.” I speak in symbols and for those whoseknowledge of cosmic location and of points in time and space will enable them tocomprehend; to the uninitiate, I simply say, “Respond to soul impact.”2. Sensitivity to that which emanates from the “centres left behind” or to thosestreams of vital energy which lie active and focussed below the threshold of thewaking consciousness. They stir the threads of memory; they draw backward theglances (and there lies magic in the energy of the eye) of the onward movingPoint, the Pilgrim on his way; they condition through ancient habit theresponsiveness of the units in the form.3. A developed sensitivity which emerges from the “furthest centre” at firstunconsciously employed and later consciously directed and attuned—a fullymagnetic and attractive sensitivity. Forget not that true interplay imposes thecondition of reciprocity and that the two points or termini of a line eventuallyvibrate in unison.A consideration of a hint given earlier as to the symbolism and significance ofthe three eyes available for man’s use will be found illuminating and theirrelation to the heart and throat will prove evocative of knowledge. They relateto the three centres above referred to and in their wider connotation relate tothe three planetary centres: Humanity, Hierarchy and Shamballa; further backstill lies a relation to the cosmic centres of the Great Bear, Sirius and [435]the Pleiades. In between these planetary centres to which I have referred andtheir distant cosmic archetypes lie three systemic centres which at this timeand under cyclic law are Saturn, Uranus and Mercury. In between these again areto be found a zodiacal triangle of Leo, Pisces and Capricorn. For purposes ofour immediate consideration the following three triangles are, therefore, to befound:[Image00009.jpg]When the significance of this is grasped, the following interesting points willappear. I give them to you for what they are worth to you and that worth isdependent upon the goal ahead of you, and where you stand today in time andspace.Triangle Three depicts the interplay of three streams of force which, in thisparticular world cycle condition and basically influence ordinary humanity.Forget not that humanity itself constitutes a great centre in the life of theplanetary Logos:a. Capricorn connotes density, firm foundations, concretisation, the mountain ofkarma that holds down the [436] struggling soul or the mountain of initiationwhich must eventually be climbed and surmounted. It signifies, therefore, thegreat force of liberation which both drives into experience and bringsexperience to an end, from the angle of humanity. This is the major stream offorce in this particular triangle at this time.b. Mercury brings in that quick and intuitive mind which interprets experience,fosters the growth of the intuition and relates the inner spiritual man to theouter human being in such a way that their future unity of purpose, plan andeffort is assured. Mercury brings about those changes in mental perception whicheventually enable humanity to act as the mediating interpreter between thehigher worlds and the three lower kingdoms in nature; thus Mercury institutesthe threefold activity of this centre in the body of the Heavenly Man which westruggle to perceive and comprehend, and which we regard as forming the threephases of the mind:1. The abstract mind—pure manas.2. The Son of Mind—soul, manasaputra.3. The concrete mind—mental body.and their correspondences in substance-energy:1. The right eye.2. The left eye.3. The third eye.In this particular world cycle it is Capricorn which is producing the moment ofcrisis—a crisis of initiation plus a crisis of destruction (related primarily tothe mineral kingdom) paralleled by a crisis of mental perception, [437]precipitated by Mercury. It is this mental perception plus world participationin the “crumbling of the mountain load of karma” which heralds the vision of thenew day from the top of the mountain.Here in pictorial language I have endeavoured to indicate the three streams ofenergy which meet in the centre called Humanity, involving therefore:1. The active intelligence of man, latent in the human centre.2. The initiatory activity of Capricorn.3. The illumining radiance of Mercury.This combination of energies produces a triplicity of activity of supremeimportance today.Triangle Two has been called the “triangle of the advanced man”; it isassociated with the kingdom of souls, with the fifth kingdom in nature as it isrelated to the fourth. It is this triplicity of forces which, playing onTriangle Three, attracts out of it those units of energy which (as a result ofthe activity of Capricorn, Mercury and Humanity itself) are ready to come underhierarchical influence and to be swayed consequently by different streams offorce to those hitherto evoking response:a. Pisces is particularly potent at present in the life of Humanity owing to itsbeing the sign which is now passing out of influence as we progress upon thegreat wheel of the zodiac. It is this sign with its combination of energieswhich has produced such a potent vibratory activity in Humanity that it cansuccessfully and eventually enact the role of World Saviour. Of this salvation,Pisces is the sign. Pisces is also the sign of [438] death, as you know, and inits death aspect we see the Piscean correspondence to the first aspect, thedestroyer aspect of the Logos. This death aspect is naturally active at theclose of the Piscean age and is consequently bringing about the present death ofform in all the three worlds.b. Uranus is the planet of occultism for it veils “that which is essential; ithides that which must be discovered and, at the right moment, it transmitsknowledge of the hidden mystery.” Today, for the mass of men, occultism isnon-existent; for the aspirant and the disciple occultism is rapidly becoming asource and system of revelation as they penetrate into the wisdom of theHierarchy.The triangle of Pisces-Uranus-Hierarchy is becoming magnetically attractive tothe triangle of Humanity. Uranus and Mercury in combination are dualities whichthe disciple learns to resolve and in the process of this resolution he shiftshis focus out of the human kingdom into the fifth kingdom, the Hierarchy ofsouls. Pisces and Capricorn in unison bring about those changes which “lift thedisciple out of the waters, wherein he is rapidly drowning, on to the mountaintop from whence he can watch the recession of the waters. Thus does he knowhimself initiate.”The present world crisis should and will see a close merging of the twotriangles in a most potent manner and this partial synchronisation (for closethough it may be it will not yet be a process of general identification) willproduce the sixfold energy needed to bring in the new sixth race and the newworld period wherein fellowship and brotherhood will be manifest in all humanrelations. [439]Triangle One is produced by the inter-relation of energies from Leo, Saturn andShamballa. Its potency is naturally felt more directly in the triangle of theHierarchy than in that of Humanity. These three energies are sometimes called(in an effort to make understanding more easy and to simplify comprehension) the“triple energy of WILL”:1. The will of self-determination—Leo.2. The will of sacrifice—Pisces.3. The will to choose—Capricorn.because the Shamballa force lies behind the other two triangles and is therecipient of energy from the three above constellations, blending them into theunited expression of will, and thus proves to be the custodian of divinepurpose. The triangles of which the Hierarchy and Humanity are the expressionare becoming responsive to Shamballa—the hierarchical centre greatly so and thehuman centre gradually so. This first or fundamental triangle is occult in thetruest sense of the word to even the trained occultist and to the majority ofthe members of the Hierarchy. Therefore only a few points can be mentioned inconnection with it as there is little to be found in even the advanced disciplewith which to reach real understanding. The information must perforce remainacademic and theoretical.a. Leo, which is the will of the self-conscious Entity to manifest, holds theclue or key to the entire problem of self-conscious being, whether it is thewill-to-be of a planetary Logos, of a group or of a man. The self-consciousnessof man is inherent in the planet itself, which is the life expression of a fullyself-conscious Being. The use of the will through the Shamballa centre [440]involves the conscious use of that energy by the planetary Logos; this isevoking response today from the world of men in terms of will, both higher andlower. The wilful (self-willed) man of the world is apt to be more responsive tothis Shamballa force than is the disciple or the aspirant because they are moreattuned to the gentler vibration of the Hierarchy. I have earlier told you thatthis Leo force from Shamballa is finding direct entry into the human centreinstead of indirectly via the Hierarchy as has hitherto been the case. Theimplications of this are obvious.b. Saturn. This energy is primarily concerned with presenting opportunity to theHierarchy and its affiliated disciples. The phrase that “Saturn is the planet ofdiscipleship” is basically true because ordinary average man, except in groupformation, does not come so potently under its influence. For the Hierarchy—as agroup—is facing a great crisis of approach to Shamballa, analogous to thatconfronting Humanity today, as it seeks approach and contact with the Hierarchy.Thus there are two inter-related crises affecting both Humanity and theHierarchy, and these should produce—if correctly effected—that which is calledalignment or integration, resulting in a far freer inflow of divine energy. Boththese “approaches” (which are in the nature of magnetic attractive “pulls”) areconditioned by Saturn; in the case of Humanity this pull comes via the Hierarchyand—apart from that Hierarchy—mankind cannot today surmount or properly handlethe crisis. This should be remembered and should speed the work of the disciplesand aspirants of the world as they struggle for human liberation and to [441]bring about divine intervention. The intervention desired should come via theHierarchy, if it is not to be too destructive in its effect. The last majorintervention in Atlantean days came via Shamballa and resulted in the partialdestruction of entire continents and lands.These three triangles of energy can, therefore, be seen as basic and determiningin all planetary affairs and event-producing. I have consequently chosen toconsider them in our efforts to comprehend this basic astrological science.2. TRIANGLES OF FORCE—PLANETS.At the same time, it will be obvious to you that, in relation to these simpletriangles, certain interlocking triangles also emerge, as for instance thezodiacal triangle of Leo-Pisces-Capricorn and the allied planetary triangle ofSaturn-Uranus-Mercury . These two triangles pour their six streams of force intoour three planetary centres at this time, vitalising and stimulating theplanetary triangle of Shamballa-Hierarchy-Humanity . Behind these three stands acosmic triangle, emanating three streams of energy which pour into and throughthe three lesser triangles, thus potently affecting every kingdom in nature.This cosmic triangle is that of the Great Bear—Sirius—the Pleiades . Thisparagraph simply summarises the preceding pages and indicates the relationbetween four triangles of energy.There are one or two subsidiary points which are of interest to the esotericastrologer and these we might briefly list in connection with these effectivetriangles, using the word “effective” to imply conditioning and potent inresults. In this present world cycle all results are of unusual significance andalso unusually emphasised in human consciousness. [442]1. Saturn, through which energy flows from Leo, via Shamballa, to Humanity,governs two decanates in Capricorn. Hence its extreme potency today in thetriangle of Humanity. Saturn breaks up existing conditions by the force of itsenergy impact, thus enabling the influence of Mercury to be more fullyexpressed. The vision can then be intuitively perceived when obstructions havebeen removed.2. Leo is one of the birth signs of the zodiac; it connotes the birth ofself-consciousness, as you know. Capricorn is also a birth sign, because it isalso an aspect or one of the arms of the Cardinal Cross—the Cross of that whichinitiates or brings into being. This has a peculiar relation to Humanity. It isthe birth of the two types of consciousness—self-consciousness and Christconsciousness—which are brought to the attention of humanity by the fact of thisLeo force, pouring through Saturn to Humanity and thus bringing Shamballa andHumanity into a closer relation, via Capricorn, active through Mercury.At this point I would like to pause for a moment and interpolate a word inanswer to a perfectly normal question which is liable to arise in the minds ofthinking students and aspirants today. Of what use is all this abstruse andabstract information to a world in agony and a world distressed? The majorusefulness of this imparted information which will condition the astrology ofthe future lies far ahead in the period after the war when again the field ofworld service opens and men have time for thought and due reflection. Worldservice is going on now perhaps in greater volume than ever before but it isrestricted to the field of releasing from slavery and alleviation of pain [443]and suffering, and, therefore, to the more strictly physical forms of help. Theservice to which I here refer is that educational process which will produce thecoming civilisation and its attendant culture. This will be based on all thecultural processes of the past and of the present, but will discard all that hasproduced the disasters of today, as far as may be possible. That means a gradualfuture usefulness for the knowledge of the underlying potencies, for they canindicate the lines of least resistance to the emerging good and the developingcrises which inevitably lie ahead in the period of reconstruction. But onepotent good can emerge even at this time from a study of these matters, providedthe student of esotericism rests not content with study (using it as an escapefrom the disastrous present) but parallels his understanding of the causes andconditions by a strenuous effort to be of aid in a practical and a definitelyphysical sense.This is the dominant emerging fact to which all that I have said bearstestimony: world conditions today—precipitated as they are by human greed andignorance—are nevertheless basically conditioned by the will-to-good which isthe primary quality of the energies and forces coming forth from the great Livesin which all that exist live and move and have their being. The Law of theUniverse (and what is law but the working out of the purposes of theseall-embracing Lives, of Their impulses and Their plans?) is to all eternity thegood of the whole and naught can arrest this happening; for who can arrest theimpact of these energies which play upon and through our planet. When I saythis, I would at the same time point out that the attitude of many students,inevitably participants in world events, that “such is the Law and such is theKarma of people and nations and such is the pre-determined destiny” [444] is farfrom right. They believe—sometimes sincerely—that all that should be done issimply to wait for results to appear and for karma and destiny to fulfil itself.Then and not till then, all will be well. But they forget that karma fulfilsitself in relation to the form nature upon which it expends its energy and thatwhere there is a static condition and a quiescent attitude, the process movesbut slowly; the life then within the form fails to experience the needed,forceful awakening; inevitably then there lies ahead a repetition of the processuntil the time comes when activity and response is evoked. This then leads toresistance to the apparent karmic necessity and this brings about liberation .Only through resistance to evil (and in this world period and in this kali-yuga,as the Eastern teachers call it, it is an essential basic attitude) can karma bebrought to an end. The law of matter still governs in the three worlds of humanexperience and “fire by friction” must burn up that which veils the steadilyincreasing brilliance of solar fire. It is the recognition of “solar fire”—as itshows itself in a transcendental idealism and radiance—by the unintelligentidealist, and his simultaneous refusal to cooperate in this period of karmicnecessity, that is prolonging the difficult and cruel situation and leading himindividually to sink deep into glamour. The simplification of the world’sproblem in terms of matter comes through a recognition of the essential dualismunderlying events. I commend this thought to all students, suggesting that theybase optimism on the long range vision, endorsed by the Heavens and corroboratedby the activity of the stars, and thus feel sure of the ending of this immediatetragic situation.It is interesting to note that the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Law and Order worksthrough Uranus which is today the transmitter of Sirian force via Pisces to theHierarchy. [445] From that “middle centre” it passes to that sensitive band ofdisciples, aspirants and workers to whose hearts and hands is committed theheavy task, incident to the re-organisation and the rebuilding of the shatteredworld structure. The seventh ray has sometimes been called a peculiar name byKnowers. It is regarded as the “Ray of Ritualistic Decency.” It aids andinaugurates the appearing of a new world order, based on a spiritual drive andon aspiration, mental freedom, loving understanding and a physical plane rhythmwhich provides opportunity for full creative expression. To bring this about,energy from Shamballa (embodying the will-to-good) is fused and blended with theorganising energy of the seventh ray and then carried to humanity along thestream of love which emanates from the Hierarchy itself. Pisces governs thiseffort of the Hierarchy because the highest aspect of Pisces which humanity canat this time in any way comprehend is that of Mediatorship. This is the energyof mediation, of right relationship. Today as never before the Hierarchy standsas a “mediating transmitter” between:1. Humanity and the will of God. The revelation of the true significance andpurpose of that will as it stands behind all world events is needed now as neverbefore. This can come through a closer relation between the Hierarchy andHumanity.2. Humanity and its karma, for it is equally essential that the laws for thetransmutation of karma into active present good are clearly grasped.3. Humanity and cosmic evil, focussed for many millenia of years in what hasbeen called the Black Lodge. Speculation anent this Lodge and its activities isboth fruitless and dangerous.[446] The latter fact is responsible for the widespread attack made upon Masonryduring this century. Masonry—inadequate and corrupt as it has been and guilty ofover-emphasising certain forms of symbols—is nevertheless a germ or seed offuture hierarchical effort when that effort is—at some later date—externalisedon Earth. Masonry is governed by the seventh ray, and when certain importantchanges have been made and the spirit of Masonry is grasped instead of theletter, then we shall see a new form of hierarchical endeavour appear to aid inthe restoration of the ancient and sacred Mysteries among men.The energy of Uranus, pouring upon and into humanity, produces the urge tobetter conditions to provide better forms for the occult and esoteric life andto blend more adequately the inner and the outer man. This is one of the reasonswhy the Moon is spoken of so often as veiling Uranus. The Moon is frequentlyused as a blind when Uranus is meant. Today the Moon is a dead world and thereason is that the Uranian urge became so strong in that far distant time whenthere were living forms upon the Moon that it led to the complete and finalevacuation of the Moon and the transfer of its life to our planet. Such atransfer is not necessary today as the consciousness of humanity is such thatthe needed changes can be brought about without such a drastic procedure. It is,however, this Uranian influence which lies behind the present shift ofpopulations throughout Europe and Great Britain and which is responsible for thesteady movement of peoples from East to West, from Asia to Europe in the earlierhistory of that continent and from Europe to the Western hemisphere in moremodern times.In the study of the interlocking of these triangles, it [447] it will becomeapparent to the student that the combination of the influences of Sirius, Leoand Uranus has been much needed at this time to foster and bring about thoseconditions which will enable mankind, under the steady influence of theHierarchy, to take the first initiation and “give birth to the Christ,” thusrevealing and bringing to the light of day the inner, hidden, spiritual Man. Itis in Leo that man undergoes the preparatory stages of this first initiation. Hefinds himself and becomes self-conscious; then he arrives at the stage ofintelligent discipleship; he formulates a conscious inner programme or purposeunder the steady pressure of the life of the indwelling Christ; he begins toexhaust and deny the demands and desires of the lower nature. This cycle ofexperience is followed by a painful life of conscious re-orientation—a cyclewherein he achieves balance and begins to “stand in spiritual Being” as a resultof constant trial and testing. Finally he stands ready for the ordeal and theaccolade of fire, preceding the first initiation . At that final stage, Humanitytoday stands. When (as is now the case) the influence of Uranus is added to theother influences and the seventh ray is at the same time entering into a majorcycle of activity on the Earth, there is then present the energy needed toprecipitate the crisis of initiation and produce a great rhythmic awakening.Astrologers would find it of interest to note similar combinations in theindividual horoscope.It must not be forgotten that Leo marks the height of achievement for the humansoul, and this is today stimulated by the Shamballa force now flowing into thecentre of humanity. This inflow will continue its critical work until in theAquarian Age, so rapidly coming into expression, the one-pointed attitude of theLeo person (or shall I call it [448] the self-centredness?) becomes the expandedconsciousness and the decentralised attitude of the Aquarian man. You can,therefore, see how full of promise is the future.In the Aquarian Age, the power of the planet Venus becomes a dominant factor inthe last decanate. This I have already told you when we were studying that sign.Upon the reversed wheel in the case of the spiritually oriented man and thedisciple, it is the first decanate under whose influence he comes which isgoverned by Venus; this should be remembered. Venus was the planet which we aretold was responsible for the appearance of the individualised consciousness inman—this in combination with other influences and forces. In the Aquarian Age,Venus will again have an analogous influence only with this difference that theemergence into manifestation of an increased individualism and self-consciousrealisation will be subordinate to the appearance of the first stages of anexpanded consciousness throughout all mankind—the consciousness of groupresponsibility. It will be perhaps better expressed as a form of groupindividualism.Therefore: behind all these events, the dim outline of a lesser triangle ofenergy can be seen; this is a blend of the energy of three planets:[Image00010.jpg]These produce a combination of the energies ofRay 3.—Active intelligence.Ray 7.—Ceremonial order or magic.Ray 5.—Concrete mind.[449] It can be noted how this combination of energies when playing uponGermany’s soul Ray of Harmony through Conflict and her first ray personality, onthe Ray of Power and the Destroyer (responsive to Shamballa) is responsible formuch of the present conflict, for the reason that the reaction of that country(under the influence of its present rulers) has been in terms of the materialaspect and not of the spiritual.Students would find it useful to re-read some of the foregoing instruction anentthe signs Leo-Pisces-Capricorn, so as to familiarise themselves with the nature,quality and influences which this great triangle (see page 435) expresses andthrough which humanity is being led at this time forward along the path ofreturn. In this connection it is well also to remember that the series oftriangles with which we have been dealing refer to and produce changes in thehuman consciousness. Another series of triangles was also given (on page 416)involving the Great Bear, Sirius and the Pleiades. These triangles concern thespiritual aspect of the planetary life and of humanity, as well as of the otherkingdoms in nature. Humanity is of peculiar importance in relation to thesetriangles because it is the destiny of humanity to transmit life to the subhumankingdoms. With these triangles of supernal forces I shall not deal becauseconscious response to their influence will not be possible till the time cycleof the third initiation arrives. I simply mention this influence so that youwill realise that there is no real contradiction or discrepancy. Still anotherenumeration of the triangles of energy emanating from the three majorconstellations are given earlier by me (on page 435) and this again is correctand not a contradiction. In this group of three sets of triangles—making nineall told—with their interlocking analogies and lesser triangular relationshipsand with also their points of fusion, you have [450] held in a “mystery ofpotencies” the entire story—past, present and future—of human evolution. Itaccounts for the changing emphases of that story, its shifting kaleidoscopicpattern, its recurrent points of fusion and its steady progress, throughchanging process, towards an ultimate revelation.Very briefly I would like to touch upon the fact that, as might be expected, theinfluences of Leo-Pisces-Capricorn which dominate the present world situation,via Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity, are potent in their oft unrealisedeffect upon the individual people. They bring about changes in his life focusand in his centres just as they have wrought corresponding changes in the threeplanetary centres. In view of this certain basic ideas can here be emphasised:1. The influence of Capricorn, via Mercury, will have a dominant effect in thehuman kingdom—itself a planetary centre.2. The individual disciple will, therefore, respond to this Capricornianinfluence most easily. It will constitute a line of least resistance, offeringopportunity, as well as the chance of possible disaster if wrongly handled.Right response will lead the disciple nearer to the door of initiation; wrongresponse will take him back into the depths of crystallisation and ofconcretion.3. Disciples who respond to the influences above mentioned will necessarily belargely conditioned by their rays, egoic and personal. First ray disciples will,for instance, respond to the Shamballa influence, transmitted from Leo andSaturn, more easily than will second ray disciples. These will in their turnreact more rapidly and consistently to the Hierarchy, transmitting energies fromPisces and Uranus. [451]4. The above facts will demonstrate the nature and quality of the response ofdisciples on Rays 1. 3. 5. 7. and Rays 2. 4. 6. and this must always be borne inmind as being true of disciples, of all men and also of nations.5. According to the response so will be the evocation of the activity of thecentres, or a centre. But—and this is a point of major importance—all disciplesmust at this time seek to find their dominant reaction in a planned response tothe influence of the Hierarchy and the energies transmitted by it. As a generalrule, the impact of Shamballa force (particularly in the case of a disciple onRays 1. 3. 5. 7.) will be of a personality nature. It is the stimulation of theheart centre with a consequent control of the solar plexus centre which shouldbe the planned result. The heart must dominate the solar plexus by thewithdrawing of its energies to the heart.6. The time has not yet come when it is safe for the aspirant or the disciple torelate the head centre and the base of the spine in response to a definite andconscious appropriation of Shamballa force. Whatever may take placeautomatically, normally and naturally and through the development of thedisciple can and should be permitted to take place, provided there is noconscious intent and that there is also a close and careful scrutiny and controlof the personality life.7. The awakening of the ajna centre with the consequent and subsequent consciouscontrol of the throat centre must inevitably take place provided the disciplefulfils two conditions. He can then become consciously, safely and correctlycreative. These two conditions are:a. A conscious orientation towards the soul and towards the Hierarchy. [452]b. A deep love for humanity, present and based on mental perception andintuitive understanding and not on emotional reaction.8. Where the above conditions are fulfilled, then the impact of the inflowingenergies will produce the required stimulation and awakening.This is all that I have to say about the response of the centres in the humanbeing to the activity of the planetary centres under systemic and zodiacalstimulation. I am not here writing a treatise on the individual training of thedisciple but am attempting to demonstrate the fact of cosmic, zodiacal,systemic, planetary and human interplay which in its turn constitutes a greatand living Whole—the life expression of a Being of Whom we only know that loveand the will-to-good, expressed through the Universal Mind, are the outstandingcharacteristics and that these are steadily emerging into increasing radiance.3. THE TRIANGLES AND THE CENTRES.It is necessary to remember that all influences which impinge upon theindividual or upon humanity as a whole pass through or are transmitted by one orother of the planetary centres. I have said little about these centres save torefer to the major three centres which we call Shamballa, Hierarchy andHumanity. We recognise them as:I. Shamballa. . Power. Purpose . . Planetary head centre . . Directing Will II.Hierarchy. . Love. Wisdom . . . Planetary heart centre . . Directed Love III.Humanity. . Intelligence . . . . . Planetary ajna centre . . . Directed MindFour other centres remain to be considered: the planetary throat centre, solarplexus, sacral centre and the centre at the base of the spine.[453] In the planetary logoic life—as is the case also with individual man, themicrocosm of the Macrocosm—certain centres are more awakened than others andvibrate in unison with systemic impulse more fully than others. In the case ofthe planetary Logos of our little sphere, the head centre, the ajna centre, theheart and solar plexus centres and the throat centre are the five focal pointsof energy which are the most alive and vibrant. The sacral centre is slowlydropping below the threshold of the logoic consciousness whilst the centre atthe base of the spine is practically entirely quiescent, except in connectionwith its pranic effects upon the form life, engendering the will to live, theurge to survival and the vitalisation of forms. These facts will give you anidea of our planetary status in the great family of the central sun and indicatewhy our planet is not a sacred planet. No planet is a sacred planet unless thecentre at the base of the spine (speaking symbolically) is aroused and the greatfusion of energies resulting therefrom has been effected. I refer to thisparticular world cycle and period and to the state of affairs in this the fifthor Aryan root-race. Students of my books and of The Secret Doctrine mustremember that any contradictions which may appear are only contradictions inTime and that when this time factor is properly understood and the student knowsto what specific cycle the information should be applied, these apparentinexactitudes will disappear.What is true of humanity, for instance, during the third root-race, may not betrue in the fifth root-race. Therefore, all that can be done is to study andrelate, to reflect and to apply the Law of Analogy, knowing that when theexpanded and more inclusive consciousness of the trained initiate takes theplace of the present human awareness, [454] then these debated points will beclarified; they will assume a true consistency and the contradictions willdisappear.The planetary centre which corresponds to the one at the base of the spine inthe human being will not be awakened until the seventh root-race and that onlywhen right relationship is established between the planetary sacral centre(which is related to the third kingdom in nature, the animal kingdom) and theplanetary throat centre, functioning properly and in unison.In the first volume of this treatise, certain hints were given anent theplanetary centres and the rays of energy pouring through them. To these I wouldlike here to refer because they are related to the Science of the Triangles. Youshould note that the three lower kingdoms in nature constitute in themselves atriangle of force and are essentially a reflection of a particular planetarytriangle. It might be of service if I here briefly tabulated again for youcertain of these major inferences—for they are little more than inferences atthis time. One point is of real interest here. I have stated that Humanity isthe correspondence in the planetary Life to the ajna centre in individual man.Earlier I told you that the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge is related to theajna centre and, therefore, in this present world cycle, you have:Humanity. .planetary ajna centre. .5th Ray of Knowledge. .5th root-race.Therefore five centres in man are rapidly awakening. These relationships proveeach other but only when seen in relation to the greater cycle. Humanity was atone time the correspondence to the planetary solar plexus and some day willshift the focus of its receptivity to the planetary heart centre; when thistakes place, the Hierarchy will [455] shift its focus of receptivity into thesphere of influence of Shamballa. Of this shift, the presence of thetwelve-petalled lotus in the highest head centre (the relating point between theheart centre and the soul on its own plane) is the guarantee. The followingrelations must consequently be borne in mind:I. Head centre . . Shamballa . . 1st ray . . 1st & 7th races . .Will; the goal.Energy of Life. Synthesis.Seven centres awakened and functioning.In first root-race alive and faintly vibrating.In seventh root-race fully awakened.II. Heart centre . .Hierarchy . . 2nd ray . . 6th root-race . . Love; the goal.Energy of Identification. Achievement of fusion.Six centres functioning.The focal point of the egoic consciousness of divinity.The fifth kingdom. The Kingdom of God.III. Ajna centre . Humanity . 5th ray . 5th root-race . Intuition; the goal.The energy of Initiation. Development of inclusiveness.Five centres rapidly awakening.The focal point of personality.The human kingdom, the fourth kingdom in nature.IV. Throat centre . . Animal . . 3rd ray . 3rd root-race . Intellect; the goal.The energy of Illumination. Creating in the light.Four centres functioning.Focal point of the instinctual consciousness.The third kingdom in nature. [456]V. Solar plexus . . Vegetable . . 6th ray . 4th root-race . Instinct; the goal.The energy of Aspiration. Unfoldment of sensitivity.Three centres functioning.Focal point of psychic response.The second kingdom in nature.VI. Sacral centre .Deva evolution . .7th ray . 2nd root-race . Responsiveness;the goal.The energy of Magnetism. Power to build.Two centres functioning; heart and sacral centres.Focal point of vibratory response to the “eye of God.”VII. Base of spine . Mineral . 4th ray .7th root-race . .Synthesis; the goal.The energy of foundational Synthesis. Completion.All centres functioning as one.Focal point of evolution.The first kingdom in nature.This tabulation may serve to make a little clearer the present general plan orblueprint of the evolutionary development of consciousness. Other developmentsare proceeding simultaneously, such as the responsive unfoldment of the formaspect and the evolution of the deva, or angel, line which parallels the humanand to which I referred in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . A third great scheme ofevolution is proceeding and that can only be referred to as the unfoldment ofdivine purpose on its own plane; of this humanity has, as yet, no faintestconception because its consciousness is still held within the limitations of itsown kingdom in nature; the Hierarchy is attempting to become responsive to thisform of energy.[457] There is another point of interest to which I wish to refer and it is onewhich is little realised by the average occult student. I refer to the outletsof planetary energy through the means of which great and general effects areproduced in the external, planetary life. In this fifth root-race, there areonly five such outlets as far as effects on humanity are concerned; man’sresponsiveness to them, is demonstrated by the fact of their relative importancein conditioning world events and world affairs. Wherever one of these outletsfor spiritual force is found, there will also be found a city of spiritualimportance in the same location. These five points are:1. London.—For the British Empire.2. New York.—For the Western Hemisphere.3. Geneva.—For all of Europe, including the U.S.S.R.4. Tokyo.—For the far East.5. Darjeeling.—For all of central Asia and India.Later, two more points or outlets for energy will be added to these but the timeis not yet. Through these five places and areas in their neighbourhood, theenergy of five rays pours forth, conditioning the world of men, leading toeffects of planetary significance and determining the trend of events. A studyof history and of current affairs will produce some understanding of theirimportance in connection with four of them. The effect of the force flowingthrough the Darjeeling centre is not so immediately apparent but it is of majorimportance as a distributing agency for the Hierarchy and particularly for thoseMembers of the Hierarchy who are dealing with and influencing current humanaffairs in this time of momentous crisis.These five points of conditioning energy produce two triangles of force in theirinterrelation: [458]1. London—New York—Darjeeling.2. Tokyo—New York—Geneva.Geneva and Darjeeling are two centres through which pure spiritual energy can bedirected with more facility than through the other three and they, therefore,constitute the higher points of their respective triangles. They are moresubjective in their influence than are London, New York or Tokyo. Together, theyform five centres of ‘impelling’ energy today.It may interest you also to know the governing rays and astrological signs ofthese five places, so far as they can be given at this time and during thispresent cycle. Forget not that the personality rays change from period to periodin connection with countries and cities just as they do with individuals:RAYS City Soul Personality Sign 1. London . . . . . . . . 5th . . . . . . . . .. . . . 7th . . . . . . . . . . . Gemini. 2. New York . . . . . . 2nd . . . . .. . . . . . . . 3rd . . . . . . . . . . . Cancer. 3. Tokyo . . . . . . . . . 6th. . . . . . . . . . . . . 4th . . . . . . . . . . . Cancer. 4. Geneva . . . . .. . . 1st . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2nd . . . . . . . . . . Leo. 5. Darjeeling .. . . . . 2nd . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5th . . . . . . . . . . . Scorpio.If students will study this information in connection with that given elsewherein connection with other nations and cities, the inter-relations now emerging inworld affairs will be seen as the result of the play of these forces andenergies and, therefore, unavoidable. The use of the energy may be along wronglines, producing separation and trouble, or along right lines, leading toeventual harmony and understanding, but the energy is there and must make itseffects in any case. As in the individual life, the results of the play of thelife of the soul upon the form aspect, one or other of the rays will dominateand control. If the person or nation [459] is spiritually oriented, the resultof the energy impact will be good and will lead toward the working out of thedivine plan and thus be wholly constructive. Where personality force dominates,the effects will be destructive and hindering to the emergence of divinepurpose. Nevertheless, even destructive force can and does finally work towardsgood, for the trend of the evolutionary force is unalterable. It can be sloweddown or speeded up according to the purpose, aspiration and orientation of theentity (human or national); it can express soul purpose or personalityselfishness, but the urge towards betterment will inevitably triumph.In the study of this Science of Triangles, the student must bear in mind thatthere is always one point of the triangle which—in a particular crisis or “eventin consciousness”—is the emanating, dynamic, conditioning energy. During thecycle (great or small, major or minor) in which it thus controls, the other twopoints express receptivity and are regarded esoterically as embodying forces.Every triangle is, therefore, the expression of one fundamental energy and oftwo secondary forces. This is a basic statement of importance and theformulation of a law under which all the triplicities of energy function in timeand space. You have consequently:1. An emanating energy centre.Dynamic expression of cyclic purpose.Positive qualified out-going ray energy.Planetary, systemic, zodiacal and cosmic energy.The basis of hylozoistic (living) expression.2. A receptive force centre.An evocative expression of the initial impelling energy. [460]A synthesis of two forces, the emanating and the receptive.A qualified, conditioning secondary energy.Motivating, blended energy, neither positive nor negative.3. A responsive point of negative energy.A major centre, completing the grounding of the emanating energy.Responsive mainly to the second point of the triangle.Source of a violent interplay between the two points of the base line.[Image00011.jpg]This distributing centre can be a solar system, regarded as a cosmic centre, aplanet, which is a systemic centre, one of the planetary centres, above referredto, a nation or an individual or one of the centres in the human etheric body.A close study of these energy streams will demonstrate two major movements:I. A downflow of energy from an emanating centre. This leads to1. Its merging with the energy of a centre of reception and its consequentqualification. [461]2. Its transmission to and its evocative effect upon a second point or focalpoint of reception.Note: This leaves one side of the triangle as yet uncompleted.3. The three types of energy (or rather one energy and two forces) proceed thenwith the following activities:a. Evocative energising of a secondary triangle.b. Pouring down one side of this reflected triangle into the evoked expressionon the physical plane.c. Producing manifestation, quality and activity.d. Forming a reservoir of descending and balancing energies.Some light on this most abstruse subject can be gained if the student willattempt to realise that the above diagram and subsequent statement describes hisown involutionary and evolutionary history. It depicts the interplay of hismonadic life, soul energy and personality force, as these three focus on thephysical plane, producing manifestation and appearance.II. A return flow of this qualified energy to its emanating source or thehighest point of the major triangle. This produces:1. The completion of the two triangles—the Real and the unreal. The building ofthe antahkarana is an aspect of this completion. This concerns the finalbuilding of the later stages of the antahkarana by the initiate. [462]2. The transmission of force from the reflected or secondary triangle in thethree worlds of human endeavour (or in the five worlds in the case of theevolution of members of the Hierarchy) is into the same focal point on the baseline of the higher triangle which received the original emanating energy.3. There are consequently two points of major importance in the higher triangle:a. The emanating point of positive conditioning energy.b. The point which receives into itself both the higher energy and the lowerforces. This point is called the soul aspect of the triangle and is always theregistering agent of consciousness. It is, therefore, the producer of crises,because the point where several energies meet is the source of crisis in theouter life.c. These crises are crises of initiation and this is true of men as individuals,of nations and of humanity as a whole.d. The overshadowing triangle is the factor which produces by its flow into andout of the secondary triangle the “moments in time and the events in space whichlead to those episodes in the life of the soul wherein force becomes energy andenergy becomes life.”Such a momentous event or crisis is now taking place in the life of humanitytoday.More along this line I may not here dictate. The subject is too vast, abstruseand complicated. I have, however, [463] indicated enough to throw some lightupon this intricate science. Summarising what I have said:1. Emanating, evocative and magnetic energies are the three types of energy,flowing from the “superior triangle.”2. Receptive, distributing and critical force are the three types of energydistributed by the “inferior or reflected triangle.”3. Two points of energy are shared by both triangles along the base line. Whenthe work is completed, the base line is formed by two blended streams of energy,which embody the energies of both triangles.4. One point of energy (the magnetic point) produces involution and outgoingduring the process of forming the lower triangle. In a later stage it—as a blendof energies—induces return of all the energies to the emanating source.At the same time, students must bear in mind that—owing to the Great Illusion—itmay appear to them that the triangles are incomplete during the evolutionaryprocess. The fact, however, is that in the Eternal Now all three sides of thetriangles eternally exist and persist. The problem is found only in theconsciousness of the subject but not in the Reality.5. It must be noted by the student that:a. The masses of men express down-pouring energy from the magnetic centre .Their rightful trend is at present downward into physical manifestation andexperience. [464]b. Aspirants and probationers express responsiveness to the pull of theevocative centre . Their urge is towards the path of return.c. Accepted disciples and initiates express the interplay along the base linebetween the evocative and magnetic points.d. Higher initiates and Masters utilise and express the energy blended in themagnetic centre. They are returning or responding to the emanating centre .Thus the sixfold triangle—objective and subjective—is completed.It will be of course obvious to you that it will not be possible to deal withall the various triangles of energy which are effective on our Earth, and which,incidentally, affect humanity exhaustively. Their name is legion. But certaintriangular relationships can be tentatively considered and their place in theplanetary or in the individual horoscope can then be later worked out. In thenew astrology which will be that of the soul, the paramount consideration of thetwelve houses (which are now of such importance) will be less emphasised and theconsideration of the three Crosses will emerge in their place. These threeCrosses make together twelve arms and it is the energy flowing through thetwelve arms and their place in the soul horoscope which will assume the majorimportance. This I will enlarge upon when we take up the theme of the threeCrosses. The twelve houses concern the personality. The four arms of the threeCrosses concern the soul and it is these twelve and their appearance in thehoroscope or their failure to appear which will govern the horoscope of thesoul. All the four influences of the three [465] Crosses will be found presentin the chart of a Master. Therefore an indication of which constellations areprimarily related to the unfoldment of consciousness and to the evolution ofspiritual understanding is of significant use here.The major cosmic Triangle works primarily through six constellations at thistime and—again at this time—the cosmic constellation and the two zodiacalenergies focus through a particular planet, using it as a transmitting agency tothe Earth. You have therefore:[Image00012.jpg]These six influences aid greatly in the development of self-consciousness andlater of the spiritual consciousness in the man who has succeeded in reachingthe point of re-orientation upon the Great Wheel. I deal not here with thepersonality influences, inclinations and determinations as they appear in thechart of the ordinary man. I deal with the influences and with those determiningenergies which pour upon the man who is on the Path of Return to the centre ofhis life and, therefore, with the final three stages upon the Path of evolution.[466] We might consequently state that the forces of:1. Cancer—Capricorn—Saturn (which are an expression of Sirian energy) enable theaspirant to tread the Path of Purification, of Probation. These energies focusand qualify the energy of the Great Lodge of the Most High in that distant Sun.They pour through the Hierarchy upon the mass of men and enable the unit in thatmass to “isolate himself and turn his back upon the past and find his way on tothat section of the Path wherein he learns to feel .”2. Gemini—Sagittarius—Mercury (which are an expression of the Pleiades) enablethe Probationary Disciple to pass on to the Path of Accepted Discipleship. He isthen becoming increasingly intuitive and entirely one-pointed whilst the natureof the pairs of opposites is clearer to him. The relation of the Mother-aspect(as embodied in the Pleiades) and of the Christ-child, hidden within the form ofthe personality, is realised and the inner, spiritual man institutes the processof initial identification with the spiritual entity on its own plane; the littleself begins to react consciously and with increasing frequency to the higherSelf. The man “presses forward on that Path wherein he learns to see .”3. Aries—Libra—The Sun (which are an expression of the Great Bear) bring aboutthat focussing of energy in the life of the disciple which makes it possible forhim to function consciously and with intention upon the Path of Initiation. Heenters the realm of the formless worlds because Aries, the sign of beginningsmakes this possible; through the potency of Libra, he has succeeded in achievingthat point of balance which makes the final escape from the pairs of oppositespossible. He now [467] knows, through transcended feeling and fromidentification with the seen Vision, the true meaning of being .This threefold process can also be covered by the three words: Sensitivity,Illumination and Inspiration.Another group of energies can be touched upon though any true elucidation is notpossible. They concern the focussed energies of the seven solar systems of whichours is one. These energies (six in number) reach our solar system, via theconstellations Taurus and Scorpio and the planet Mars.[Image00013.jpg]Their peculiar nature, objective in evolution and basic purpose is only revealedto initiates above the fifth initiation. They are concerned with the problem ofdesire (which is to humanity a problem but not in its higher octaves) and withits transmutation into spiritual will and divine purpose. They are theoriginators of conflict, are closely connected with the fourth Ray of Harmonythrough Conflict and are, therefore, in a peculiar relation to the fourthCreative Hierarchy, the human, and to our Earth in this fourth round.In these eight constellations are to be found the influences which are mainlyconcerned with the evolution of the soul—in the solar system, in the planetEarth and in man. They are the “eight potencies of the Christ”; they govern thepsychic unfoldment of the life in all forms. They are of the utmost significanceto the aspirant.[468] Four constellations have been omitted from this list:Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . . Virgo . . . . . . . . . . Aquarius . . . . . . . .Pisces Self-consciousness. Christ consciousness . . . Group consciousness . . .. Universal consciousnessThey are basically concerned with the expression of consciousness on the outerexternal planes of expression or with the fusion of soul and form in order todemonstrate fully a state of awareness. These facts will become apparent if thefour esoteric planets connected with these four constellations are consideredand related:The Sun . . . . . . The Moon . . . . . Jupiter . . . . . . . . . . . . Pluto TheSoul . . . . . . The Form . . . . . Beneficent Life . . . . . DeathIt will also be apparent to the astrologer of the future along which lines thechart of the soul must be drawn; the major triangles and the three cosmicCrosses will control his deductions as to the unfoldment of consciousness. Thetriangles indicate possibility; the Crosses indicate process and points ofcrisis.There is, as I have said, no way of handling this Science of Triangles at lengthor exhaustively, for it is the science of the universal geometrical blueprintunderlying the phenomenal worlds and is also closely related to Karma. Itconcerns the first precipitation of the interaction and the effect of theduality of manifestation, of spirit-matter, as they constitute one substance.But, in its relation to esoteric astrology, it is possible to indicate certainfundamental interpretations of this relation which will enable the astrologer towork out eventually the astrology of the soul , to outline the horoscope of theego and to draw up the new types of charts which will demonstrate soul purposeon its own plane and group relations also on the physical plane and [469] so beof aid to the intelligent, dedicated personality. Ponder on this.There is one triad of cosmic energy that is of supreme importance upon ourplanet and it is the united influence of its three constellations which willeventually bring about the initiation of the planetary Logos; this will warrantany future planetary expression of His life to be termed a “sacred planet.” Atpresent our Earth is not regarded as a sacred planet. Later, when these threeenergies have produced adequate effect and the needed planetary changes havebeen produced, the term “sacred” will be deemed correct and appropriate. Thisstatement of course means little to any student at this time. When, however, heis able factually to realise two things, the case will be different. These are:First, that the threefold energies which lie back of the activity of the centreat Shamballa concern the planetary Logos; humanity is slowly becoming sensitiveto that influence, but only in mass formation and not individually. Onlytheoretically can a disciple take note of this fact.Second, these influences are playing upon that aspect of human life which wecall the Monad; they will, therefore, have a steadily increasing effect upon thePath of Initiation.These three constellations are Leo—Virgo—Pisces. They are spoken of esotericallyas “the Producers of that which knows, the Informers of that which is awakenedand the Constructors of the modes of fusing Wisdom. They produce a unity; Theyshatter that which They have produced only again to produce it in greater beautyand in wider fullness.” These words are clear. This triangle is, at this [470]time, an inverted one with the Leo energies in the closest contact with ourplanetary life. The following triangle will show this more clearly.[Image00014.jpg]These three are connected definitely and increasingly with the unfoldment ofhuman consciousness in three main aspects.There is the development of self-consciousness to be fostered and this is themajor effect—as well you know—of the force of Leo. The influence of thisconstellation aids in the manifestation of individual will, individual love, andindividual intelligence; it fosters the “ahamkara” or egoistic principle; itproduces the emphasis upon the “I am” attitude which is so necessary a stagebefore the individual can merge himself as a conscious Self-respecting unit inthe Whole. But behind this influence and pressing through into manifestation isthe force of Virgo (the mother or custodian of the Christ-consciousness) whichshatters eventually the synthesis and the lower unity already produced by theLeo energy; it stimulates the soul within the form as well as the soul withineach atom in the form, because the genius and uniqueness of Virgo is that itproduces the form as well as stimulates the life within that form and,therefore, nourishes and energises two lives simultaneously. It is a powerfuldual energy, a potent expression of the anima mundi or the soul of the world. Itwas the recognition of [471] this which made the ancient astrologers mergeVirgo-Leo into one sign. Then as the dualism of the human spirit (spirit-matter)became a fact in the consciousness of man, the sign was divided into two signsand the war of the pairs of opposites became a “war with purpose” and is,incidentally, reaching its climax today. This fact will be obvious to all trueesotericists.Another stream of energy is also pushing through and producing effects uponthose in the human family who not only respond to the Leo force and areconsequently individuals in their own consciousness but are responding also tothe steadily expanding Christ-consciousness; of this they are becomingincreasingly aware in their own individual experience. This is the higher aspectof the energy of Pisces; it is awareness of the group, of the whole and of theuniverse. It is the energy of buddhi, the higher aspect of the lower psychicnature; it is the aspect of the mediator in contradistinction to the medium. Itis intuitional control instead of the intellectual overlordship of Leo and thelimitations of Virgo.These three energies are today playing potently on humanity, producing:1. The self-consciousness of man, as he emerges out of the mass.2. The recognition of the Christ life and nature, as the aspirant for the firstinitiation emerges out of the group of world individuals.3. The awareness, universal in nature, of the initiate, as he emerges out of theranks of the world disciples.All this is, therefore, brought about at this time by the steady inflow of theenergies of Leo-Pisces-Virgo and these lie behind the very rapid unfoldment ofthe three types of [472] consciousness to be found in varying degrees inhumanity today.There are, as I pointed out earlier, seven great crises in connection with thehuman being upon the path of evolution; they cover the earlier, the later andthe final stages of his growth. These it should be borne in mind areprecipitated through the conditioning influences of seven great constellations.Let us consider them for a moment. They are:THE CRISES OF THE SOULCrisis Quality Constellation Cross 1. Crisis of Incarnation . . . . . .Individualisation . . Cancer . . . . . Cardinal 2. Crisis of Orientation . . . .. . Reversal . . . . . . . . . Aries . . . . . . . Cardinal 3. Crisis ofInitiation . . . . . . . . Expansion . . . . . . . Capricorn . . . Cardinal 4.Crisis of Renunciation . . . . .

Initiation . . . . . . . .Virgo . . . . . . Mutable 7. Crisis of Burning ground . . . Liberation . . . . .. . Leo . . . . . . . . FixedYou will note that two of the constellations which we have just beenconsidering—Leo and Virgo—are to be found in this list. Five constellations arenot so intimately concerned with the mass human crises but are more definitelyand specifically related to the unfoldment of the individual disciple. Theseare: Sagittarius, Libra, Taurus, Pisces and Aquarius. Pisces has, however, atthis time a unique relation to the seven constellations which produce the greathuman crises; it also completes the final united effort of the Triangle: Leo,Virgo, Pisces. It has been the steady impact of Piscean force which has at longlast brought humanity, the world disciple, to the very door of initiation. Forover two thousand years, Piscean influence has been playing upon mankind; it hasbrought about the demand for world adjustment; it has developed theinternational spirit and has led to the formation of groups in every department[473] of human living and so laid the foundation for the future synthesis inAquarius. The influence of this triangle finds symbolic expression in the lifeof the self-conscious individual who reaches self-awareness in Leo; in theculturing care of Virgo and the final self-release in Pisces.We might here give a little time to the practical lessons to be learnt from theseven crises through which man, the individual, and humanity, the larger whole,must pass.In considering these crises which take place in the life history of the soulfrom its first incarnation until its final release, it will be found that sevenmajor constellations and their influences, pouring through the exoteric and theesoteric planets, stage the circumstances and condition the environment of theonward-moving, spiritual man. Certain lives will occur when one or other ofthese constellations will exert a predominant influence. They will produce thatfocussing of forces which—given a man’s particular equipment at any point intime—will evoke from him the maximum of possible effort, thus enabling him tomove forward into a more enlightened state of consciousness. You will note, thatI do not say “enable him to be victorious.” A man may succeed in surmounting thetesting conditions and in emerging conqueror over circumstances upon thephysical plane and yet be defeated. The reason for this is that unless thestruggle and the emergence produce basic changes in consciousness and a greatlyextended horizon, they will prove futile to accomplish their intended task.In studying the moments of crisis, it must be remembered that they are passedthrough approximately three times from the standpoint of the major life cycleand are also recapitulated in a minor sense in some particular life or group oflives. The three cycles of major import in the consciousness of thereincarnating ego are: [474]1. The evolutionary cycle from individualisation to liberation, from the stageof primitive man to the emergence upon the stage of world affairs of a Master ofthe Wisdom, a Buddha or a Christ.2. The cycle of aspiration from the stage of intelligent integrated man to thatof the accepted disciple and from the experience of intellectual expression inthe three worlds to that of the probationer who is seeking trial upon the Pathand is beginning to take his spiritual unfoldment consciously in hand.3. The cycle of initiation from the preparatory stage of accepted disciple tothat of the Master and the still higher grades. These seven crises are eachre-enacted during the process of self-initiation into the world of meaning andof reality. They constitute the keynote or the motif of each of the seveninitiations. Each of these seven initiations permits entry into the state ofdivine consciousness on each of the seven planes of divine experience andexpression.The influences of these seven constellations is symbolised by three trianglesand a final synthesis or focal point. Esoterically, these triangles are usuallydepicted as superimposed but for the sake of clarity we separate them.[Image00015.jpg][475] We have here three triangles but, at the same time, only seven influencesfor the effects of the conditioning forces of the two triangles predominantlyactive in the first two cycles are fused and blended in the third. These blendedinfluences (with the aid of the remaining five constellations, Sagittarius,Libra, Taurus, Pisces and Aquarius) enable the disciple to escape out of thehuman kingdom into the kingdom of souls. We have therefore:1. Seven constellationsCancer, Aries, Gemini, Scorpio, Capricorn, Virgo, Leo, which bring the man fromthe stage of individualisation to the Path of Discipleship.2. Eight constellations (which include three out of the seven) which bring thedisciple from the stage of selfhood to that of the self-initiated and perfectedsoul.It is not my intention to analyse these crises. These, the student who is inearnest and who is observant can work out for himself.I would also point out that I have (again necessarily) only depicted the threetriangles in a certain order with the lower points expressing the energy ofcertain constellations. In this form they depict the final outcome and the finalresults of a particular group of three crises . It must be remembered that onlythrough much repetition and frequent focussed effort are these results attained.A crisis is brought about by a certain habit of mind, developed in the vehicle;it is surmounted in time only by a certain habit and rhythm of the spiritualcontent of the man’s nature. It is the establishing of a certain objectiverhythm which produces a crisis; it is the emergence of a particular subjectiverhythm which enables a man to surmount the crisis and to capitalise on theopportunity. Please bear this in mind.[476] These seven crises can also be related to the seven centres in the vitalor etheric body, and advanced students will later find that there is a closecyclic interrelation between:1. The seven planes of divine expression.2. The seven states of resultant consciousness.3. The seven crises, leading to the expansion of consciousness.4. The seven initiations, climaxing these expansions.5. The seven centres wherein these results are realised.Let me remind students that all the twelve constellations bring about man’sevolutionary development and eventual release from the Great Wheel of livingexistence. Seven of these are, however, primarily useful in bringing about theseven crises of the soul whilst five of them are instrumental upon the finalstages of the Way in enabling the disciple or initiate to utilise the experiencegained and the values grasped in effecting entrance into the fifth kingdom innature. You have, therefore, the 12 + 7 + 5, making 24 in all and in these areto be found the “24 episodes which mark the Cross of Life.” From the standpointof Christian symbolism (even though the interpretation is as yet inadequate)these seven crises correspond to the seven stations of the Cross which mark theway of an advancing world Saviour.In connection with the five constellations which are peculiarly active in thelife of the advanced disciple and initiate, the influences fall into twotriangles of force, because Leo—focussing the energy of the sevenconstellations—is included, thus linking the self-conscious aspect with thespirit: [477][Image00016.jpg]Shirk not these crises, hard and difficult though they may appear to be.Difficult they are. Forget not that the habit of confronting crises is along-established one within the consciousness of humanity. Man has the “habit ofcrisis,” if I may so call it. They are only the points of examination as tostrength, purpose, purity and motive and the intent of the soul. They evokeconfidence when surmounted and produce greatly expanded vision. They fostercompassion and understanding, for the pain and inner conflict they haveengendered is never forgotten, for they draw upon the resources of the heart.They release the light of wisdom within the field of knowledge and the world isthereby enriched.4. CONCLUSIONS.We have reached a point in our consideration of the Science of Triangles whereinwe can pause for a minute to consider our next approach to this subject andchoose the theme by means of which we can throw more light upon it. It should bynow be obvious to you that this Science of Triangles concerns the beneficence ofDeity and that, through the intricate combinations of cosmic, systemic andplanetary triangles, the purposes of God are working out. Those purposes aremotivated by love. It is through these relationships that love expresses itself,brings about the needed changes for that expression, and human consciousness isbrought into the required state of inclusiveness.[478] It is through the squares or the quaternial relation that the form aspectis brought into relation and adequacy to the will of Deity, expressing itselfthrough the gradually unfolding consciousness aspect. I am explaining thissituation in these simple words because it must be apparent to you that only asthe soul illumines the mind can the significance of the teaching be grasped. Itis only when the stage of initiation is reached that the true meaning willemerge. In the meantime, I have sought to awaken in your minds a reaction to theabstract truth lying behind the two following statements:1. The Science of Triangles is related to the total expression of the divinetriplicity of manifestation: will, love and intelligence or life, consciousnessand form. Until, therefore, the disciple can express in himself the integratedresemblance to these three aspects, he will not be able to grasp the meaning ofthis subjective astrological science.2. On our planet, the Science of Triangles is related to the three majoraspects, as they express themselves through Shamballa, the Hierarchy andHumanity. Again, therefore, we come up against the need for the approach of theintegrated human being to this science because only the man who is responsive tothese three focal points of energy can understand the interplay. Only, in fact,can the man apprehend the underlying truth whose two head centres and his heartcentre form a triangle of flowing energies.In this connection, I would remind you of what I said earlier in the treatisethat the Science of Triangles is related to spirit and synthesis. I would remindyou also that what I have written in this astrological section of the Treatiseon [479] the Seven Rays is intended for the instruction of disciples at theclose of this century and during the post-war period. Again I would also pointout that I stated earlier that this science must always be approached from theangle of the three basic energies: i.e., those coming from the Great Bear, fromthe Pleiades and from Sirius; because (conditioned by time and space) thesethree types of energy pour through the three major centres, Shamballa, theHierarchy and Humanity.My problem has been to choose which of the myriad interlocking triangularrelationships I would take up with you and thus present this science in such amanner that it would prove of real interest. The inner web of light which iscalled the etheric body of the planet is essentially a web of triangles and whenthe evolutionary process is completed, it will have been organised. At present apattern of squares is the major construction of the web but this is slowlychanging as the divine plan works out. The etheric webs of the sacred planetsare largely triangles whilst that of the Sun is that of interlaced circles. Theeffort on Earth today (as seen by the planetary Logos) is to bring about atransformation of the web of the planet and thus slowly change the existingsquares into triangles. This is done by the creation of division, by theapplication of the Law of Separation, but also by the recognition, inconsciousness, of duality, the application of directed motion and the appearanceof two triangles in the place of one square. When this has taken place, theperceiving consciousness recognises identity and the rule of the square isended. These words were once spoken to me by an ancient seer who bisected thesquare esoterically, thus forming two triangles and united them in a freshmanifestation to form a Star of Life. Ponder on this.[480] It is for this reason that the astrologers of the future will emphasisethe relation and the interrelation of triangles. The new astrologer will, as Ihave hinted before, lay the emphasis upon:1. The Science of Triangles, as the result of the growth of the initiateunderstanding.2. The rising sign, as it indicates the way of the soul.3. The place of the three Crosses (the Cardinal Cross, the Fixed Cross and theMutable Cross) in the life of the soul. This will eventually supersede thehouses in the horoscope and the 12 arms of the three crosses will take the placeof the 12 houses when casting the horoscope of the soul.I would reiterate again the fact that the new astrology will be occupied withthe charting of the life of the soul. The 12 constellations, as they play theirpart in the life of the disciple through the medium of their distributingagents, the ruling esoteric planets, will gradually transform the exoteric formof the chart of the individual. This will be due to the focussing of the variousenergies in man, consciously and through intent, and will not concern hisnegative reaction to the conditioning energies.I would like here to call your attention to an interesting point which has adefinite bearing upon the power of the individual to grasp the new astrology andto comprehend the Science of Triangles. The astrological symbols for Virgo andScorpio are triple in nature—the only two which are. When the disciple graspsthe meaning behind this triplicity, he will be ready to grasp the significanceof this abstruse science and to work with the new astrology. Virgo and Scorpioare two signs connected with the growth of the [481] Christ consciousness; theymark critical points in the soul’s experience—points of integration wherein thesoul is consciously at-one-ing itself with the form and at the same time withspirit. I said the soul’s experience , not the experience of the man upon thephysical plane. When the experience undergone in Virgo is consummated in Piscesand the tests of Scorpio have led to illumination in Taurus, then the effect ofthese four energies (Virgo, Pisces, Scorpio, Taurus) will be to make man thetrue triangle, expressing the three divine aspects or energies as they come fromthe three major conditioning constellations: the Great Bear, the Pleiades andSirius.I could fill many volumes with the indications of the various triangles as theyare discovered to be related in time and space. Under the will of Deity and theunalterable energy at the heart of the manifested zodiac, they produce thechanges in consciousness which make man divine at the close of the world cycle.But the theme is too vast and all I seek to do is to point the way towards a newscience and towards those esoteric combinations of energies which will, whenrecognised, enable humanity to make more rapid progress, fuse and blend theenergies of the three planetary centres and transform our Earth (through theagency of human thought, reacting to zodiacal influences ) into a sacred planet.It is, therefore, the influence and combination of energies as they affect theaspirants and disciples of the world which must suffice for any increasedunderstanding; with these I shall gradually deal and I shall also in the finalpart of this section give you an exegesis of the tabulation. In that tabulationis given the relation between the rays and the constellations and this is basicin its implications.Certain of the forces with which we are dealing govern [482] humanity in apeculiar manner and the effect of their influence is to bring about theat-one-ing of the three planetary centres.There are four constellations, as you know, which convey the required energieswhich will make humanity divine. They are Aries, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius. Ineed not enter into an analysis of them as this was covered when we studied eachof them earlier and separately. I would, however, like to point out that each ofthese constellations is closely connected, as a transmitter of energy, withcertain stars, lying outside our zodiac altogether, thus connecting our tinyplanet with certain great focal points of energy.Aries, the initiator of impulses (either the impulse to incarnate or the impulseto return to the originating source) is closely in touch with one of the starsin the Great Bear to which we give the name “Pointer” in common parlance. ThisPointer is a “major star of direction” because through it (in this world cycle)flows the will to unify and to bring about synthesis. This is the force whichbrings about the fusion or integration of the personality, the at-one-ment ofpersonality and soul, the unification of humanity or the Great Approach of theHierarchy to Humanity. It will produce also the integration of our Earth intothe body of the “sacred planets” and the consequent establishing of a triangleof force composed of the Pointer, Aries and our Earth. This triangularrelationship will have a potent effect upon the solar system as well as upon theplanet itself and is also one of the factors producing the shift in the Earth’saxis. Related to this triangle is a secondary one within our sun’s orbit,composed of Vulcan, Pluto and the Earth. In the Archives of the Great Lodge thisis referred to symbolically as: [483][Image00017.jpg]This is one of the most interesting and informing astrological symbols I havegiven you and indicates a most momentous relationship. You have here two majorand three minor energies brought into close relation; this is analogous to thetwo major rays and the three minor rays which condition a human being inmanifestation. These are the five energies which concern the informing life ofour planet. They produce, in humanity, conscious evolution, direction and thefounding of Shamballa upon the Earth. They are the five energies connected withthe will-to-be, but from the consciousness angle and not the material expressionof manifestation. Their activity and united influence in the realm ofconsciousness produced the appearance of another triangle: Leo, Polaris andanother of the Pointers and these two groups form an interlocking directorate,potently effective in the evolution of consciousness.You have, therefore, through these related triangles, the appearance ofShamballa and Humanity—the two poles of divine expression—will and activity.We come now to another triangle, the activity of which produces themanifestation of Hierarchy—the intermediary between Shamballa and Humanity:Scorpio, Sirius and Mars. These, in relation to our Earth, produce the fourstreams of energy (initiating and transmitting) which lead humanity towardsdiscipleship and initiation.When the work of all these triangles has been concluded, [484] humanity (and ina mysterious sense our Earth) will be functioning in perfect rhythm and willrespond to the energies pouring in from Alcyone.I cannot too strongly repeat that esoteric astrology is entirely concerned withthe forces and energies which affect the consciousness aspect of the humanbeing, and condition the personality life. This is the point which must beconsidered above all else. In other words, esoteric astrology is concerned withthe soul and not with the form and, therefore, all that I have to say refers toconsciousness, to its expansion, to its effect upon its vehicles, the form,and—in the last analysis (as will be later established)—with the Science ofInitiation. This I have earlier pointed out, but the idea is so new and theapproach so universal or cosmic, that it is not easy for those trained in modernexoteric astrology truly to comprehend the significance of this teaching. Inconsidering the Triangles, which I have chosen to use as the theme inelucidating this immense subject, this emphasis upon the consciousness aspectmust not be forgotten.For the remainder of this section on the Science of Triangles, I shall take upthose triangles which are at this time and in this world cycle producing effectsin the human consciousness. These effects are of two kinds: those which aregeneral, not so easily discernible and which affect the masses of men, and thosewhich are more specific in their results, more tangibly effective and whichserve to condition the consciousness of the world aspirants, disciples andinitiates. Today, this dual movement of energies is going on, producing a slow,steady awakening of the mass consciousness so that individual self-consciousnesson a large scale will be the result and the more rapid stimulation of [485] thealready awakened consciousness of advanced humanity so that initiation will beachieved.The effectiveness of this dual process can be seen if it is realised that threegreat signs—Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius—are today exceedingly active and workingin close relation with each other. They are the three signs whose energies areaffecting humanity as a whole—as a kingdom in nature. Leo: the sign of theself-conscious individual is potent in its mass effect and today, through thestress of circumstance and the dire results of certain events, thousands of menand women are stepping out of the ranks of the mass-conscious herd and out ofthe deep sleep of irresponsibility and becoming aware of themselves as detached,functioning entities. Sagittarius is powerfully affecting the world aspirantsand leading them towards those attitudes of mind which will produce anunswerving allegiance to the spiritual values and an unalterable adherence tothe good of humanity. Aquarius is—with equal potency—affecting the worlddisciples and initiates, leading them to world service on a large scale,producing group activity and that living usefulness which is the hall-mark ofthe pledged disciple. The influence of these three constellations is feltthrough their esoteric planets, and the mass movement in consciousness (forwhich Leo is responsible) can be noted as possible even by the novice when herealises that the ruling planets in Leo are, from all three angles—exoteric,esoteric and hierarchical—the Sun. The mass movement towards individualself-consciousness is today enormously intensified as is the parallelingindividual movement towards initiation.Leo appears again in another important triangle at this time: Aries, Leo,Virgo—a triangle which potently aids in inaugurating the New Age. That New Agewill be distinguished [486] by a truly self-aware humanity, conditioned by asteadily manifesting Christ consciousness. The potency of Aries, as it initiatesthose happenings which will set in motion the causes that will produce the NewAge, can be seen today in the trend of all the new movements, in the formulationof the various world orders, in the discoveries of science and in the emergenceof the new types in the different kingdoms in nature. This activity has onlybeen felt since 1835; the potency of Leo can be traced since then in the vastnumber of people who are achieving the integration of the personality andbecoming self-conscious, as well as in the emergence of thousands ofself-conscious world aspirants who are subordinating gradually their integratedpersonalities to the good of the group. The influence of Virgo appears in themany religious, spiritual and mental organisations and movements which indicateso directly the awakening of the Christ consciousness in humanity. Thesetriangles thus can be seen as vibrant living factors, producing world changesand giving a tremendous push onward to human unfoldment.It is interesting to bear in mind that just as each sign is divided into threedecanates which are ruled by specific planets, so the zodiac itself is a part ofa still greater zodiac and is also divided into three parts. The three-folddivision of the zodiac is ruled by three constellations which are to thisgreater zodiac what the planets are to the decanates. The three rulingconstellations are Scorpio (on the Fixed Cross), Taurus (also on the FixedCross), and Pisces (on the Mutable Cross). This would necessarily be so becausetesting, trial, desire, illumination, matter, form and salvation are thekeynotes of our solar system and of our Earth in particular. This solar systemis a system which is expressing the second aspect of divinity and hence the[487] emphasis upon the forces pouring through Scorpio, Taurus and Pisces.Ponder on this. A hint is there conveyed anent our zodiac which is of supremeimportance to the astrologer of the future. In the cosmic decanates to which Ihere refer, it will be found that three great sons of God have expressed for usthe quality, the keynote and the development which is expressive of eachdecanate:Hercules—Scorpio.—Strength through testing.Buddha—Taurus.—Illumination through struggle.Christ—Pisces.—Resurrection through sacrifice.In a peculiar sense, these three constitute a triangle of initiation and are ofparamount potency in the initiation process. They express strength, illuminationand love in full expression .Leo appears again in this world situation as a part of a triangle of crisis ,for the combination of the three constellations involved invariably producescrisis. These three are Leo, Libra and Capricorn. Leo, when dominating thetriangle, produced in the past the crisis of individualisation. Later in humanhistory, when the point of balance was reached, Leo was again potent. H.P.B.pointed out that there came a time when the balance was reached between spiritand matter and from that time on the tendency of humanity was towards evolutionout of matter and not involution into matter; humanity turned towards the Pathof Return and not the Path of Outgoing; this has become increasingly apparent.Today, Capricorn is producing a third crisis in the long, long history ofmankind—a crisis of initiation, and the possibility of this crisis provingeffective and producing the appearance of a new kingdom of nature on Earth issteadily becoming more and more possible. I would like here to remind you of anearlier reference [488] to still another triangle in which Leo is active and toanother of the great triangles conditioning humanity: Taurus, Leo, Aquarius.Taurus incites towards experience and towards the gaining of knowledge; Leoleads to the expression of that experience in daily life and to the effort tojustify knowledge; Aquarius takes that experience and the knowledge gainedthereby, and turns it to conscious use in the service of the group. We mightphrase it thus:Taurus—in the final stage of development demonstrates as the illuminedconsciousness.Leo—produces the truly Self-conscious man.Aquarius—is the man of spirit, of life, and of consecration to the divineexpression of service.It is here that the importance of the esoteric rulers can be seen. Thesetriangles, composed of three constellations are (according to cyclic law)dominated at any one time by one of the three, the other two being subordinated.These triangles are called in the Archives of the Lodge “Triangles inRevolution”; at one time, one of the three constellations will be thecontrolling factor; at another time another will swing into effectiveness andlater a third. Each of these in turn pours its force through its esoteric rulerand the other two energies become of secondary importance. When this informationis connected with the teaching upon the rays, it will be apparent how necessaryit is to know which of the triangles is the focal point of transmission, becausein this way it will be discovered which ray energy is in major or minorexpression.Leo, as we have seen, is for instance a most important transmitting agency inthe present world crisis. This means, therefore, that Rays I and V areexceedingly active; it means, secondly, that the Sun’s influence is potent, both[489] exoterically and esoterically. It means also that the planets which arerelated to these two rays will be very active and, therefore, that Pluto andVenus are dominant in producing world results. I cite this as an instance of theinterrelation of planets, constellations and rays; a close study of the worldcrisis will indicate the plausibility of the premise as to the activity of Leoas a major force in the triangle at present responsible for producing the worldsituation.Earlier in this treatise, I gave you the relation between the rays and theconstellations and stated that each of the seven rays expressed itself throughthe medium of three constellations or through a triangle of energies. Thisrelation is the basis of the entire Science of Triangles and, therefore, ofastrology itself; it is also related to the rays, the constellations, theirruling planets and our Earth in a great synthesis of energies; it relates oursolar system to the larger whole and our tiny non-sacred planet to the solarsystem. Let me repeat that statement and thus indicate to you some vital factsanent this world of interweaving energies. The Rays pour through, are expressedby and are transmitted through the following constellations:Ray I . . . . . . . . . . Aries . . . . . . . . . . Leo . . . . . . . . . . . .Capricorn Ray II. . . . . . . . . . Gemini . . . . . . . . Virgo . . . . . . . .. . Pisces Ray III . . . . . . . . . Cancer . . . . . . . . . Libra . . . . . .. . . . Capricorn Ray IV . . . . . . . . . Taurus . . . . . . . . . Scorpio . .. . . . . . Sagittarius Ray V . . . . . . . . . Leo . . . . . . . . . . .Sagittarius . . . . . . Aquarius Ray VI . . . . . . . . . Virgo . . . . . . . .. . Sagittarius . . . . . . Pisces Ray VII . . . . . . . . Aries . . . . . . . .. . Cancer . . . . . . . . . CapricornCertain interesting facts emerge if this tabulation is carefully studied. Let melist some of them for you, leaving you to apply the information as may seem bestto you.1. This interrelation is effective in this world cycle and will remain so untilthe end of the Aquarian Age. By [490] this I mean, that these seven triangles ofenergy are today pouring their force through one of the constellations in eachtriangle.2. Today, the following points of the triangles of energy or the followingconstellations in the triangles are the controlling factors:Ray I.—Aries: This constellation, as might be expected, is the source of theinitial energy, producing the New Age.Ray II.—Virgo: This constellation produces the increased activity of the Christprinciple in the heart of humanity.Ray III.—Cancer: The mass movement towards liberty, release and light, sodominant today, is caused by the energy of this sign.Ray IV.—Scorpio: Through this constellation comes the testing of humanity, theworld disciple.Ray V.—Leo: This sign produces the growth of individualism and ofself-consciousness, so prevalent today on a world scale.Ray VI.—Sagittarius: This sign produces the focussed one-pointed effort of theworld aspirant.Ray VII.—Capricorn: This Capricornian energy produces initiation and theovercoming of materialism.3. It will be noted in this tabulation that several of the constellations findthemselves in one or more of the triangles of energy, showing, therefore, that:a. Ray IV is relatively inactive. [491]b. Ray VII like Ray I is active through all three points, even though Aries isthe most potent and active.c. Ray VI as might be expected, is equally expressive and effective.4. Five of the constellations—Taurus, Gemini, Libra, Scorpio and Aquarius—areonly found in one of the various triangles.a. Taurus (Ray IV) is not active exoterically as the fourth ray is not inmanifestation at this time.b. Through Scorpio, Ray IV is focussing esoterically the work of the worlddisciples, preparing them for initiation.c. Gemini is only found in the triangle of Ray II and at this time, Virgo andPisces are carrying the major task of transmitting second ray energy. Today theworld is focussed (spiritually or materially) and the fluctuations of the pairsof opposites are much lessened temporarily. Gemini, therefore, is the inactivepoint of the triangle, though still potent from the esoteric angle of theindividual disciple or initiate.d. Libra is also found relatively inactive in the triangle of Ray III. Todaythere is no true balance but the opposition of spirit and matter is so violentthat the Libran force is relatively quiescent. Ray III is expressing itselfthrough Cancer, as far as the mass is concerned and through Capricorn, on a muchsmaller scale, in relation to the world disciples. Capricorn esoterically leadstowards the externalisation of the Mysteries. [492]e. Aquarius is not today the active point for the transmission of the energy ofRay V. However, shortly, as the Sun passes more fully into the sign Aquarius,the triangle will again revolve and bring the Aquarian point into a controllingposition.5. It is interesting to have in mind that Ray V governs the evolution ofconsciousness through the revolution of its triangle: Leo, Sagittarius andAquarius. This is from the angle of hierarchical effort, as I earlier pointedout. Throughout human evolution, this major triangle governs the relation ofhumanity, through the mind, to the Hierarchy and the approach of that Hierarchyto the human centre of energy. Let me recall to your attention the followingfacts in this connection:Sagittarius The Approach of the Hierarchy . . . . Lemurian in date. Proceedingsteadily always. The PAST . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Impetus thengiven still persists. Mental unfoldment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Instinct.Intellect. Intuition. The work of the Master Mason . . . . To raise humanity tothe mountain top of initiation. Leo The Work of the Hierarchy . . . . . . . . Toraise the mass consciousness. The PRESENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Tocapitalise on the original impetus of this sign. Psychic development . . . . . .. . . . . . The growth of the response apparatus and the synthesis of the innerawareness. The work of the Entered Apprentice. To learn and acquire knowledge.Aquarius The Achievement of the Hierarchy. . The self-consciousness of Leo givesplace to the group consciousness of Aquarius. The FUTURE . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . The merging of the human centre Aquarius and the Hierarchy. SoulExpansion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Recognition of relation. The work ofthe Fellow Craft . . . . . . The building and service of the temple of humanity.[493] From the standpoint of our theme (the evolution of consciousness) it mustnever be forgotten that the aim is to bring the solar Angel, the Son of Mind(called in The Secret Doctrine , the Divine Manasaputra) into the seat of power.This task is pre-eminently entrusted to the three great Lives Who functionthrough Gemini-Libra-Aquarius.A point arises here which is one of real moment or perhaps, I should say that aquestion might here be asked: How does it happen that one tiny non-sacred planetshould be considered of such importance that these great Lives should beconcerned with the unfoldment of mind in humanity? The answer is that they arenot. It is humanity which—under the urge of great inflowing and outflowingenergies—is concerned with the problem of mental development. In the lastanalysis, the problem of response to and interpretation of the environingcontacts is one which is to be found on every planet and particularly upon thenon-sacred planets. This response must be evoked, not only in the fourth kingdomin nature but in all the kingdoms. Our solar system is one in which sensitivityto contact is the dominant quality; it is in process of becoming cosmicallyaware; it is driven by need and environing cosmic circumstance to developlove-wisdom and both these words are [494] descriptive and expressive of theconsciousness aspect. Love is response to contact and this—in the humanbeing—means understanding, inclusiveness and identification. Wisdom connotesskill in action as the result of developed love and the light of understanding;it is awareness of requirements and ability to bring together into a fusedrelationship the need and that which will meet it. Service is essentially ascientific mode of expressing love-wisdom under the influence of one or other ofthe seven rays, according to the soul ray of the serving disciple. The wholeproblem is one concerning our planetary Logos. It might be said (in order tomake our theme comprehensible to you) that the evolutionary process—from thestandpoint of the ordinary human being—is to make the non-sacred planet, ourEarth, responsive to cosmic impacts thus bringing more inter-related and innerintegration into the logoic body of expression. There are other purposes but itis only after the third initiation that a man begins to comprehend them.These three constellations, cyclically and eternally, leading the “EternalPilgrim” along the path of mental unfoldment produce in him the final stage ofmental evolution upon the Path of Initiation. Illumination, the term applied tothat final stage, is a synthesis of instinct, intellect and intuition. Studentsmust bear in mind that:1. Gemini—expresses the relation of the pairs of opposites as they swing the maninto activity and evoke his mental perception. With the aid of the rulingplanets (Mercury and Venus) the mind begins to function and when the esotericplanet comes into expression and transmitting potency “the Messenger and theAngel exchange their understanding.” (Venus and the divine Manasaputras areclosely connected. A.A.B.) [495]2. Libra—expresses the point of balance achieved, prior to a secondary activityand the period of assimilation by the mind of past experience. These processes,when successfully carried forward, evoke the intuition and this brings intoactivity what is called the super-mind which is the response of the illuminedmind to the Mind of God.3. Aquarius—expresses the activity of the mind which has been initiated into thepurposes of the Universal Mind. It is the sign which brings the soul into activecooperation with the inner plan of God. This we call service.There are, therefore, great Triangles of energy which affect the mental responseapparatus of humanity and to the above triangle which concerns the unfoldment ofthe mind, two others can be added:I. 1. Taurus . . . . Desire . . . . . . . . . . . the incentive to evolutionaryunfoldment in the human kingdom. 2. Scorpio . . . Aspiration . . . . . . . thekey to the testing of the disciple. 3. Capricorn . . Illumination . . . . . .the liberation of the initiate. II. 1. Sagittarius . Direction . . . . . . . .expression of the intuition. 2. Cancer . . . . Incarnation . . . . . . .experience of realisation. 3. Leo . . . . . . . Self-consciousness . mode ofdevelopment.There are other major triangles which are called “triangles in consciousness”and, as you well know, the most important of these for mankind is the triangleof Cancer, Leo and Aquarius. They are important at this time because theinfluences pouring through these three are basically responsible for the growthof the human understanding and the unfoldment not only of man’s responseapparatus, the [496] form nature, but also of his expanding perception of thatwhich is contacted. This threefold process under these three constellationsproduces finally the identification with that which is perceived to be thedivine essence, underlying form. This identification with that which is thesubjective and real Self and the consequent withdrawing from that which is thenot-Self is the keynote of the fourth initiation.From the mass awareness in Cancer, the man becomes an individual in Leo and theslow unintelligent sub-consciousness of the herd becomes the self-awareness ofthe developed man in Leo. Instinctual reaction gives place to conscious,intellectual activity. This dual activity in turn gives place to the groupawareness which is the gift conferred by Aquarian activity; the super-consciousdivine man then transcends his limited self-consciousness and the intuitionsupersedes the intellect.At this stage in the unfoldment of the human consciousness, there is little thatI can say further anent the Science of Triangles. I have hinted at the entirestructure of living, moving, focussing and transmitting light triangles whichshould underlie (and eventually will underlie) the manifested universe. I havepointed out certain relations between the various constellations, the esotericplanets and our Earth. I have shifted the approach of the astrological studentaway from the world of tangible happenings, precipitated events, and personalcharacteristics (which are distinctive of exoteric modern astrology) into theworld of conditioning energies, controlling incentives, impulses and causes, andhave thus laid down the basis of an inner esoteric astrology which must governthis ancient science in the future. I have emphasised in your consciousness, theweb of light and energy which is the recipient of zodiacal and otherextra-systemic forces and I have pointed to the first [497] dim outline of theastrology of the soul and of the unfolding consciousness of man. I havepresented to you some esoteric facts which must for a while at least remainhypotheses and theories to the average astrologer and probably unwelcome ones atthat; I have made statements which are of necessity revolutionary in nature and,therefore, disturbing, if not apparently untrue or based on premises which denyall that the modern astrologer has worked out and hitherto held dear. In thisconnection two of these ideas are basic where the astrology of the soul isconcerned:1. The reversal of the life of the disciple upon the Wheel of Life, by means ofwhich his progress becomes anti-clockwise.2. The influence of the rising sign which is held by the esoteric astrologer toindicate soul possibility and direction, versus the personality opportunity,offered by the nature of the vehicle of response.These two ideas are obviously revolutionary and when to them you add the newsets of planetary rulers which I have given you, it is not surprising if youfeel the vastness of the astrological theme. This, however, was the firstreaction which I hoped to get from you. Astrology must now argue from theuniversal to the particular because it must in the future deal with soulunfoldment and not with the personality horoscope as hitherto.At this point, I would remind you that nothing I have said negates the chartingof the personality horoscope as at present done in the case of the average manwho is proceeding clockwise around the Wheel of Life. I have but brought intoyour field of astrological research, the astrology [498] of the humanconsciousness, of the solar angel, of the son of mind, the spiritual man.In the latter part of this century, what I have given to you will bedemonstrated to be true; this will happen where disciples, highly developedaspirants and initiates are concerned. The old exoteric astrology will stillpersist and prove its usefulness where the average man is in question, focussedin his personality life and oriented towards the material world.Much progress towards right understanding of astrology will come later whencertain new meditations on the twelve signs of the zodiac are made available.When the world again settles down to calmer living and conditions are adjustedto a more stable rhythm, these new meditations can form a potent source ofusefulness in “brightening the web of life” and in producing more effectivespiritual living among men.The problem of all disciples remains the same. This is to live simultaneouslythe acutely sensitive inner life of the Pilgrim upon the path of life, of ahuman being in the world of human events; to live the group life of the pledgeddisciple and the mass life of humanity; to fulfil his own spiritual destiny,through the medium of a controlled personality and, at the same time, toparticipate fully in the life of humanity upon Earth—this is no easy task.We have completed what I felt possible to communicate anent the Science ofTriangles—a science which concerns the entire subjective pattern ofmanifestation and the significance of which is closely inter-related with theTrinity of manifestation. Another name for this science is the Science ofEtheric Structure or Substance. That being so, that science deals with life,quality and appearance in the three worlds of divine Purpose and Will and, forthat [499] reason, all that I can do in this treatise is to convey to youcertain “seed thoughts” which—at some future date—will blossom forth as thebasic Science of Relations. This subjective relation will be both vertical andhorizontal, particular and universal, specific and general. With the presentmental equipment of humanity, all that is possible for man is to grasp certainfacts and vaguely sense certain intuitive implications and ideas. Later, he willperceive intuitively the underlying structure of ideas and sense the basicsynthesis which life itself contains. Therefore, beyond what I have given you,you cannot go today.But the aftermath of the war will change all this. Once there is a measure ofnervous release from strain and once the swing of the world movement has againstabilised, humanity will transcend itself. The spiritual values will emergemore clearly, the fact of the inner world will be no longer questioned as man’sincreased sensitivity enables him to respond to the higher impression and theinner inspiration; his ability to live the vertical life of the spirit and thehorizontal life of relationship will grow with each decade.Then the relation of life to form, of spirit to body, of the soul to thepersonality will demonstrate in the realm of quality, and the quality of theimmediate divine aspect, the Christ consciousness, will emerge in a mannerundreamt of today by any of you—even the most advanced thinkers. Speculation onyour part is useless. Time alone will serve to demonstrate the veracity of thepicture I portray and the validity of the inner spiritual structure. Thisstructure has always been present but it has been heavily overlaid by thematerial desires of mankind. A thick crust (if I may use such a word) ofthoughtforms veils and hides the inner realm of beauty and of meaning, ofquality and of spiritual consciousness. This crust is being blasted away by thepresent [500] catastrophic condition in the world. Men will feel at the close ofthis present war as if nothing had been left them and that they are destituteand denuded of all that made life worth living—so dependent have they becomeupon the so-called high scale of living. But these attitudes will serve asstepping stones to a new life and a better and more simple way of living; newvalues will be released and comprehended among men and new goals will berevealed. And the day will come, in the experience of humanity, when men willlook back at the pre-war centuries and wonder at their blindness and be shockedat their selfish and materialistic past. The future will shine with an addedglory and, though difficulties and the problems incident to world adjustment andthe new relationships between the spiritual man and his material environmentwill be found, the future will prove itself as the best yet unrolled.Difficulties will be found on all planes up until the last initiation but thedestructiveness of the life process will never again be so potent. The reasonfor this is that humanity is most definitely emerging from the thralldom ofmatter and in such cases destruction parallels the impact of the descendingspirit upon opposing matter. Ponder on this statement."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV - THE SACRED AND NON-SACRED PLANETS[503] There is, as you may imagine, little that I can say on this matter for itconcerns one of the great and major mysteries of initiation. It deals with andis related to the spiritual status of the planetary Logoi, those great Beings inWhom all forms of life on all planets live and move and have their being. It isconcerned with Their point in evolution, with Their goals and objectives uponthe cosmic Path and with the initiation for which They—in Their incomparable andincomprehensible livingness—are preparing.Basically it might be said that a planet is regarded as \"sacred\" when itsinforming spiritual Life has taken five of the major cosmic initiations and thata \"non-sacred\" planet is one whose planetary Logos has not taken theseinitiations. This is an inadequate definition and is only in any way to beunderstood if you bear in mind that initiation is a process of developinginclusiveness .a. Man is becoming inclusive in the planetary sense; the five major initiationswhich he eventually takes give to him a range of awareness which is infinitelybeyond anything of which he can conceive at present. These initiations endow himwith the \"freedom of the planet.\" He is then responsive to all states ofconsciousness within the planetary ring-pass-not, and is becoming sensitive toextra-planetary perception. [504]b. The Logos of a non-sacred planet is becoming inclusive in His consciousnessto all that is found within the solar ring-pass-not. He is establishing anesoteric \"understanding relation\" with all that lives within the body ofmanifestation of a solar Logos and is likewise registering a sensitive responseto the quality of the Life which informs the Sun, Sirius. He has taken threecosmic initiations.c. The Logos of a sacred planet transcends the knowledges, reactions andresponses which are purely those of the solar system, is conscious of or vitallyresponsive to the life of Sirius and is beginning to respond consciously to thevibratory influences of the Pleiades. You need here to bear in mind in thisconnection that the Pleiades—though they are regarded as embodying the matteraspect in manifestation—are in reality and literally the expression of thatPrinciple of Life which we call vitality, prana in its various stages ordegrees, ether or substance.The Logos of a sacred planet has taken five cosmic initiations.d. The Logos of a solar system is esoterically called the \"Sacred Triangle ofall-inclusive Force\" because this great Being includes within His focussedawareness the fields of expression of the Great Bear, the Pleiades and Sirius.They are to Him what the heart, the head and the throat centres are to thedeveloped initiate on this planet. He has taken those initiations of which thehighest initiate upon our Earth has no faintest conception. Forget not, that Ihave told you elsewhere that there are divine aspects and divine characteristicswhich are [505] as yet totally unrevealed even to the most advanced humanity. Nohuman being of a lower degree to that of the third initiation can even faintlysense and dimly react to these underlying factors in the existent divinemanifestation. Today, the significance of will and its distinction fromdetermination, strength and fixed intention is only just beginning to beunderstood. Just as a discussion of the intuition or of the nature of theeternal revelation would be utterly meaningless to the savage in the darkestpart of the undeveloped areas of the world, so would a discussion of theseunknown divine attributes be equally meaningless to you. All that you cancomprehend (and that with the utmost difficulty) is the three divineaspects—will, love and intelligence. There are others, for our Logos is asevenfold Being and four remaining aspects are as yet unrevealed to humanity,though sensed by the Hierarchy. These are \"objectives of esoteric spiritualattention\" by the Logoi within the solar ring-pass-not.You will see, therefore, that the section of our teaching upon which we are nowentering will be necessarily brief, because we shall be dealing with factorswhich must remain incomprehensible. It is consequently a waste of your time andmine to do more than touch very briefly upon such matters.Some understanding of the distinction between a sacred and a non-sacred planetwill come if you can realise that there is a paralleling correspondence betweenthe consciousness of the initiate (up to and including the third initiation) andthe consciousness of the Logos of a non-sacred planet. Soul and body,consciousness and form are blended and a [506] definite fusion is taking place.Two divine aspects are in process of intimate relation. The disciple bringsabout this relationship within his little system, and the planetary Logos on afar larger scale within His range of influence and control. In this process Hecarries with Him all the four kingdoms in nature. For both theselives—microcosmic and macrocosmic—this fusion produces Transfiguration, thethird initiation. The Logos of a sacred planet has carried the divine workfurther along and is occupied with the task of synthesising into one unit ofconscious response and activity, the higher divine aspect, that of the Monad,the will aspect. When this is accomplished, will, love and intelligence areblended and spirit, soul and body are at-one. Then the quality of the divineexpression will be divine purpose, impulsed by will, motivated by love andcarried forward with intelligence.Astrologers should here note that, in their work, they have not duly taken intoconsideration (when dealing with the twelve houses or mansions of the soul)whether the planet is sacred or not. The effect of the influences of a sacredplanet or a non-sacred one are very different, for one will affect primarily thelife in the three worlds whilst a sacred planet will aid in the processes ofaffecting the fusion of soul and body, of consciousness and form; it will alsoproduce the quickening of the intuition (the spiritual soul) which is the loweraspect of the Monad. The sacred planets are, as you know, seven in number:1. Vulcan 4. Jupiter 2. Mercury 5. Saturn 3. Venus 6. Neptune 7. Uranus[507] The non-sacred planets are only five:1. Mars 4. The Moon, veiling a hidden planet. 2. The Earth 5. The Sun, veiling aplanet. 3. PlutoIt is interesting here to note that the non-sacred planets rule the first, thefourth, the fifth and the eighth houses in the lesser zodiac. Our Earth is alsoa non-sacred planet. You have, therefore, four non-sacred planets, controllingor ruling a fifth non-sacred planet—a correspondence to the four aspects of thelower man. You have there, first the physical outer shell, the etheric or vitalbody, astral body and the mental body, plus a fusion with the fifth body, thepersonality. The task of our planetary Logos and of all advanced human beings isclearly to be seen. From a larger and more synthetic attitude, you have the fourkingdoms in nature and the veiled fifth kingdom, the kingdom of God.From still another angle you have:Aries—ruled by Mars.Cancer—ruled by the Moon, veiling a sacred planet.Leo—ruled by the Sun, veiling a sacred planet.Scorpio—ruled by Pluto.You will note that Pluto and not Mars is here mentioned by me as a non-sacredPlanet, ruling Scorpio. The reason for this is that there is a relation betweenMars and Pluto analogous to that between Venus and the Earth. Esotericallyspeaking, Mars is the alter ego of Pluto; the activity of Pluto at this time andin this lesser world cycle is very important on account of its esoteric approachto the Earth, impelled thereto by the vivification of its life by a display ofMartian energy. The Earth, Mars and Pluto [508] form an interesting trianglewith Venus behind the scene acting as the impelling soul acts towards a rapidlyintegrating personality. This triangle should not be forgotten when casting thehoroscope, because it indicates a relation and a possibility which can be(though it often is not) a major determining factor, prior to passing on to theProbationary Path. The four houses, governed by the four non-sacred planets (notcounting the Sun) are \"houses of the personality, mundanely oriented\" and thereason is not far to seek. The seven remaining houses, governed by the sevensacred planets are not so purely material nor are they so exoterically oriented,yet all the twelve indicate limitation or that which withholds the Dweller inthe mansion from expanding his consciousness, if he permits himself to beimprisoned by them. On the other hand, they offer opportunity if he is orientedtowards the higher life.I might again point out that Mars is the transmitter of sixth ray force and itis this which makes the first house of action in the physical body that of thedevotee who fights for that which he desires or for that to which he aspires.The warrior, devoted to a cause, comes into being upon the field of action, theEarth, which is itself an expression of the third Ray of Intelligent Activity.Aries, the first house, and Mars and the Earth initiate conflict, focussed in aform.Again, the Moon is the ruler of Cancer and is related to the fourth ray, andrules the fourth house. Here you have the idea of form being the custodian of aliving spiritual essence, of the home, whether the home is the fourth or lowestaspect of the personality or the fourth kingdom in nature, but all ruled by thefourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict—a harmony to be wrought out within theform on Earth.The Sun, the transmitter of the energy of the second [509] ray, rules the fifthhouse or mansion of the soul, the causal body in this case; the force of Leo isalso involved, the force of the self-conscious soul. The spiritual man, aware ofhis identity says in this house: \"I am the eternal cause of all relation. I amand I exist.\" The dualism of the second ray is first realised in the fifth houseby man, the embodied fifth principle.Pluto, transmitting first ray energy, rules Scorpio, the sign of discipleship,of the man ready for the fusion brought about through the influence of thesacred planets, and governs the house of major separations and of death. \"Thearrow of God pierces the heart and death takes place.\" But in this connection itmust be remembered that death is definitely brought about by the soul. It is thesoul which shoots the arrow of death. (The upward pointing arrow is theastrological symbol of Pluto.)It is only in the present cycle that the Sun and Moon \"veil\" certain planets andare the exoteric symbols for certain esoteric forces. As evolution proceeds, theplanets will not be veiled. Their influences will not be so remote. At presentthe mechanism of the majority of the human family is not tuned to the receptionof the rays from Vulcan, Uranus or Neptune whilst Pluto at present only evokesresponse from groups or from those disciples who are enough evolved rightly torespond. The three veiled planets—Vulcan, Uranus and Neptune are all sacredplanets, embodying first, seventh and sixth ray energies. Vulcan is never anexoteric ruler and only comes into real activity when a man is on the Path,whilst Uranus and Neptune are rulers of the eleventh and twelfth houses, andgovern Aquarius and Pisces. The implications will be clear to you.It is not my intention to deal with the houses in detail. Modern astrologershave worked this out relatively satisfactorily, [510] for the houses concern theprison of the soul and its limitations and with these there is a widespreadfamiliarity. As you know, I am concerned with the astrology of the soul and withthe influences of the esoteric planets.Three suggestions I will however make:1. If the investigating astrologer will substitute the esoteric planets for theorthodox exoteric planets (and I have indicated these in connection with thesigns of the zodiac) he will get much instructive information, and (if heperseveres) the verification of my ideas.2. If he will distinguish between the effects of the sacred planets and thenon-sacred he will find the sacred planets endeavour to fuse the personality andmake it the instrument of the soul and the non-sacred planets influence morespecifically the form nature; much light on the pull between the pairs ofopposites may then pour in.3. If he will study the \"fluid area\" where the planets, veiled by the Sun andMoon, come into play and will realise that he must decide (from a study of thechart of the subject and any knowledge he may have) what is the point inevolution reached and which of the three veiled planets is the ruler, he willget much intuitive understanding. He will find himself able to throw much lightupon the problem of the probationary disciple when considering the exotericrulers and upon the problems of disciples when dealing with the esoteric rulers.If the astrologer will consider these three points and will be willing toexperiment with them, a great stride forward into the unveiling of the astrologyof the soul will take place. He will find it useful also to work out the highercorrespondences to the material realities for which the houses stand. Forinstance, I will give you some idea of [511] these correspondences in connectionwith the first two houses:First House:Physical body or form.—The causal body of the soul.Appearance or manifestation.—The emergence of the soul.The head. Brain.—The head centre.Personal activity.—Soul expression.Mannerisms, etc.—Ray types and qualities.Second House:Finances. Monetary interchange.—Prana.Expenditures.—Use of energy.Possessions.—Control of the form.Losses.—Withdrawal from matter.Gains.—Acquisition of spiritual powers.The other ten houses you can work out for yourselves. It is interesting to note,for instance, in connection with the second house (and the same idea can beapplied to all of them) that Taurus, the mother of illumination, and Venus, theendower of mind plus the embodied soul, are related and active in this house.The light of matter and the light of the soul are both involved in the use ofenergy and in the problem of what is desired, what is regarded as loss, and whatshall be the gained objective. It is, therefore, the house of values—material orspiritual.1. THE CENTRES, THE RAYS AND THE SIGNS.We come now to a consideration—brief and inadequate but I hope suggestive—of thecentres as they are related to [512] the planets, viewing these planets asexpressions of and transmitters of ray influences. You will realise that I amonly dealing with the interplay between the planets and the centres where man isconcerned and only in a broad and general sense because that interplay isdependent upon—1. The point of evolution.2. Whether the focus of the life isa. Below the diaphragm.b. Above the diaphragm.c. In process of transference from the lower to the higher.3. The rays of the personality and the soul.4. The condition of the centres and whether they are awakened, awakening or asyet undisturbed.Only these generalisations are possible, owing to the vastness of the subjectand the immensity of detail in the world of effects. Another complication liesin the fact that though there are seven major centres, there are twelve planetswhich—in time and space—condition the centres. It is the centres of initiateswhich are ruled only by the seven sacred planets; among average men, some of thesacred planets dominate and some of the non-sacred. In undeveloped man, the fivenon-sacred planets control, with the head and the heart centres under the ruleof two sacred planets, which planets being determined by the rays of the souland of the personality. As the ray type does not emerge until there is somemeasure of advanced development, it will be obvious to you that the theme isthereby complicated still further; that dogmatic assertions are [513] notpossible until such time as the astrologer is sure of the two major rays of thesubject.Certain basic assertions can nevertheless be made:1. All the centres are governed by one or other of the rays.2. The rays use the planets as transmitting agencies and we know which rays—inthis world cycle—are related to the different planets. As given earlier, theyare as follows:Sacred Planets Non-Sacred Planets1. Vulcan . . . . . . . . . 1st ray 1. Mars . . . . . . . . . . 6th ray 2.Mercury . . . . . . . . 4th ray 2. The Earth . . . . . . 3rd ray 3. Venus . . .. . . . . . . 5th ray 3. Pluto . . . . . . . . . . 1st ray 4. Jupiter . . . . .. . . . . 2nd ray 4. The Moon . . . . . . 4th ray 5. Saturn . . . . . . . . . .3rd ray (veiling a hidden planet) 6. Neptune . . . . . . . . 6th ray 5. The Sun. . . . . . . 2nd ray 7. Uranus . . . . . . . . . 7th ray3. Ordinary humanity is ruled by the exoteric planets; advanced humanity,disciples and initiates by the esoteric planets.4. The Sun sign—with the exoteric planetary rulers—rules the personality,indicates inheritance and equipment and is a summation of that which has been,thus providing the background.5. The rising sign, with the esoteric planetary rulers, indicates soul purposeand points the way to the future, offering opportunity.6. The horoscope, built around the Sun sign, is adequate for ordinary humanity.The exoteric planets rule and the man lives within the limitations of the twelvehouses.7. The horoscope built up around the rising sign, with the esoteric planetsruling, will convey the destiny of the [514] disciple. As I told you, thedisciple will later be responding to the influences of the twelve arms of thethree Crosses as they pour their influences through the esoteric planetaryrulers via the twelve houses.8. The Sun sign, governed by the ruling esoteric planets and the rising signgoverned also by the esoteric planets, can both be used in casting the horoscopeof the initiate; when superimposed upon each other, the outer life of theinitiate in the three worlds and the inner life of subjective realisation willappear. This mode of super-imposition will be a feature of the new astrology.9. When the Sun sign, with the exoteric rulers, is worked out in a chart, therising sign with the esoteric rulers is also worked out and the two aresuperimposed upon each other, the problem of the disciple in any one incarnationwill appear.If these statements are added to the three I earlier gave you, you will havetwelve suggestions as to the lines along which new astrological investigationcan run, providing proof of the accuracy of astrological deduction and theguarantee of the truth of what I tell you.It is just as impossible to determine which of the planetary influences areconditioning the centres in the fourth kingdom in nature or in the Earth(viewing it as the vehicle of the planetary Logos) as it is in man, theindividual, unless the point in evolution is know n and it can be determinedupon which stage of the Path of Return the Dweller in the form—macrocosmic andmicrocosmic—is standing. The whole subject is constantly shifting and changing,just as the individual human being is constantly changing his focus or is to befound working first in one area [515] of his \"body of force\" (the threesubstantial bodies) and then in another.Each changing personality sees a different ray force enter and each ray governsor transmits its forces through one or other of the seven centres; the Sun signin each incarnation will be different, leading necessarily to a different risingsign and therefore to a complete new set of planetary influences. Thus thecentres in the vital body come under varying pressures and stimulation. In onelife, the stimulation applied may tend to vivify the solar plexus or to driveits energies upward into its higher point of transference, the heart centre. Inanother, it may be seen to be focussed in the throat centre, and by indirectactivity affecting the sacral centre and—under the major Law ofAttraction—producing a raising of the force to the higher creative focus.As you well know theoretically, the Science of Occultism is the Science ofEnergies and of the forces upon which they make their impact; this, whenconcerning man, the individual, and the centres within the human vehicle (majorand minor) leads to the Science of Laya Yoga or of the force centres. Theseagain, according to astrological deduction, come under the influence of certainplanetary rulers. These relate them in turn to certain great Triangles of Force,formed of three major conditioning constellations. Therefore, the emphasis laidupon the Science of Triangles and its including Science of Esoteric Astrology;this must inevitably take shape in terms of energy, received, transferred andused, and throw light upon the abstruse factors which condition the centres andthus make man what he is at any one time. It is a statement of fact that theworld of the occultist is the world of energy, of forces, of their origin, theirpoint of impact and the methods of their assimilation [516] and transference orelimination. Unless, however, there is some scientific method of comprehension,some mode of adapting the life to these factors and some process ofexperimentation in order to prove the fact, the statement remains relativelyuseless to the intelligent human being; it remains in the form of an hypothesis,to be proved or disproved. The man who is attempting to master his lower natureand has the goal of expressing his innate divinity requires a golden threadwhereby he can find his way out of the caverns of bewilderment and the areas ofspeculation and enquiry. This process of investigation, deduction and proof, theScience of Esoteric Astrology and its subsidiary sciences will eventuallyprovide. The foundation is already laid. What I here give can provide anotherstep forward and further light. It might here be stated that until theantahkarana (the bridge of light between the higher and the lower minds, betweenthe Spiritual Triad and the three-fold personality) is being definitelyconstructed, these sciences will remain obscure to the average intellect. Once,however, the intuition can come into action, via the antahkarana, light willgradually begin to pour in. The world must begin to accept and give weight tothe conclusions of its intuitives; they have ever taken the first needed stepsin the unfoldment of the human consciousness. It is the complexity of detailwhich primarily is responsible for the confusion. The intuition (as thephilosopher understands it) is the ability to arrive at knowledge through theactivity of some innate sense, apart from the reasoning or logical processes. Itcomes into activity when the resources of the lower mind have been used,explored and exhausted. Then, and then only, the true intuition begins tofunction. It is the sense of synthesis, the ability to think in wholes, and totouch the world of causes. When this becomes possible, the [517] investigatingastrologer will find that the complexities of the problem will disappear and thedetails fall into obvious position and in such a manner that the sum total willappear in a blinding light of surety. At present students cannot see the woodfor the trees, as the proverb says, and that proverb is right. These sciencesare mutually interpreting.During the life cycle of humanity through which we are now passing, in therelation between the centres and the rays and, therefore, between the centresand the planets, it will be found that the centres are governed by the followingrays:AVERAGE MAN—EXOTERIC PLANETS1.

PlutoTo these rays must be added (in both groups of human beings) the fourth raywhich governs humanity itself as a centre in the body of the planetary Logos,thus bringing all the ray influences into a sevenfold stream of energy, playingupon the lower self in the three worlds or upon those who are entering into orare a part of the fifth kingdom in nature. Intensifying the problem for humanityas a whole is the problem of the individual within that whole. To the influencesto which he is subjected as an individual through his [518] past and his ownpeculiar horoscope and to those in which he shares as a part of the fourthkingdom in nature must be added the effects of his two major rays (personal andegoic). These indicate his type of mechanism and his soul quality. It must notbe forgotten either that his seven centres are in close relation to theplanetary centres and that he is conditioned not only by the centres in his ownnature and their rays but also by the centres found within the human kingdom andalso by the planetary centres. With these we will now proceed to deal.2. THE RACES, THE RAYS AND THE SIGNS.The theme we will now consider is one which is of general interest but not ofindividual moment. Arguing as one ever must from the universal to theparticular, it is essential that humanity relates its own mechanism to thegreater mechanism through which the planetary Life functions and views his soulas an infinitesimal part of the world soul. It is necessary for him, therefore,to relate his Sun sign to his rising sign and his soul to his personality,viewing both as aspects and integral parts of the human family. This will beincreasingly the case. This process is beginning to demonstrate in the steadilyexpanding group, national and racial consciousness which humanity is todaydemonstrating—a consciousness which shows as a spiritual inclusiveness or as anabnormal and wicked attempt (from the standpoint of the soul) to fuse and blendall nations into a world order, based on material issues and dominated by amaterial vision. There was nothing spiritual in the vision of the leaders of thepowers which were called the Axis powers. But the spiritual intent of mankind isslowly growing and the great Law of Contrasts will eventually bringillumination.[519] I make these references to the present world situation because unless whatI have to say is practical in value during this century of destiny, I might aswell work at other modes and methods of raising the human consciousness. Butthere are those who see the issues clearly and will make due application of theimparted truths and for them I write.Our theme concerns the planetary centres, the rays and the signs which governand control them. I would first of all call your attention to the followingfacts which will bear repetition:1. Our Earth, being a non-sacred planet, is in process of becoming a sacredplanet. This means an interim of upheaval, chaos and of difficulty.2. This transference out of the lower states of consciousness, expressed throughthe lower centres, into a higher state, can and will take place in this worldperiod and in this century if humanity so wills it, if the Forces of Lighteventually triumph and if the new world order comes into being. This it will doif the lessons of the war are learnt and right action follows as a result.3. Three factors must also be borne in mind:a. The whole problem is vaster than anything the human consciousness can grasp,because it concerns the life experience and a point of crisis in the life of theplanetary Logos.b. He, the Lord of the World, is releasing new energies into the form aspect,i.e., into the Life and the lives of the various kingdoms in nature.Humanity, being the most developed—both from the angle of the mechanism and ofconsciousness—is the point of greatest response. The mineral [520] kingdom,through the excessive use of its form in the meeting of warnecessities—munitions, ships, and planes, etc.—is being profoundly affected asare buildings, for instance, in blasted cities; the vegetable kingdom is almostas deeply affected through the destruction of vast areas of forests, fields andwide spaces of vegetation.c. The Shamballa force, thus pursuing its work of destruction, is an aspect ofthe will and intention of the planetary Logos but its first and primary effecthas been to stimulate the will-to-power and the will-to-have of certain greatand unspiritual groups. Later this will aspect will evoke the will-to-good andthe will-to-build and to this humanity will respond on a large scale. Thus theevil which is now being spread abroad by the opponents of the Forces of Lightwill be neutralised by the fixed intention of the men and women of goodwill towork for the good of the whole and not for any one part.It might, therefore, be said that what is truly taking place in the world todayis the transference of the energy of the planetary solar plexus to the planetaryheart centre. The forces of cupidity, aggression, glamour and greed will betransmuted in the present furnace of pain and fiery agony and will be raisedinto the heart centre. There they will be changed into the power of sacrifice,of inclusive surrender, of clear vision of the whole, and into cooperation; thisis an aspect of the principle of sharing.When I say these words, I am not speaking idealistically or mystically. I ampointing out the immediate goal; I am indicating a problem of our planetaryDeity; I am giving [521] you the clue to a scientific process which is going onunder our eyes and which is today at a point of crisis.As this is the Aryan or fifth root-race (and I do not use this term in theGerman, materialistic and untrue sense) there are today in the body of Him inWhom we live and move and have our being, five focal points of spiritual energy,expressing themselves through five awakened centres in that body. These fiveare:1. Geneva.—The European continent.2. London.—The British Commonwealth of Nations.3. New York.—The American continent.4. Darjeeling.—Central and Western Asia.5. Tokyo.—For the Far East.Today, these five centres are being abnormally and deliberately stimulated andvitalised. The energy which flows from them is profoundly affecting the world,holding great hope for the future but producing most disrupting and disastrouseffects where the material side of human life is concerned. There are twocentres in the planetary Life which are as yet relatively quiescent as far asany world effect is concerned. To them I assign no other focal point beyondhinting that within the continent of Africa one will some day be found, andlater still (many millions of years ahead) another will be discovered in theregion of Australia. It is, however, with the five centres in this fifthroot-race that we are concerned.The force which the centre at Geneva is expressing (at present ineffectually,though later a change will come) is that of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom, withits major emphasis at this time upon the quality of inclusiveness. It isconcerned with the \"binding together in brotherly love\" and [522] with theexpression of the nature of service. This planetary centre, which conditions thelittle country of Switzerland, has had a most potent effect upon that country; astudy of these effects will demonstrate future possibility for the world, oncethe flow of its energy is less obstructed. It has produced the fusion of threepowerful racial types in group formation and not through admixture as in theUnited States; it has enabled two relatively antagonistic divisions of theChristian faith to work together with a minimum of friction; it has made Genevathe origin of the Red Cross—that world activity which works impartially with andfor the nationals of all countries and for the prisoners of all nations; ithoused that sad though well-intentioned experiment which was called the Leagueof Nations; it is that which has protected that small country from theaggressive sweep of the Axis powers. The motto or note of this centre is \"I seekto fuse, to blend and serve.\"The force which is centred in London is that of the first Ray of Will or Powerin its building aspect and not in its destroying aspect. It is the service ofthe whole which is being attempted at great cost and the effort is to expressthe Law of Synthesis which is the new emphasis, pouring through from Shamballa.Hence the fact that the governments of many nations found asylum in GreatBritain. Likewise, if the Forces of Light triumph because of the cooperation ofmankind, the energy expressing itself through this powerful empire will bepotent in establishing a world order of intelligent justice and a fair economicdistribution. The keynote of this force is \"I serve,\" as I told you earlier inthis treatise (see the last page of A Treatise on the Seven Rays , Vol. I).The force expressing itself through the centre, New York, is the force of thesixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism. [523] Hence the conflicts everywhere to befound between the varying ideologies and the major conflict between those whostand for the great ideal of world unity brought about by a united effort of theForces of Light, backed by the cooperative effort of all the democratic nationsand the separative materialistic attitude of those who seek to keep the UnitedStates from assuming her responsibilities and her rightful place in worldaffairs. This latter group, if they succeed in their endeavour, will deny theUnited States her share in the \"gifts of the gods in the coming age of peacewhich will succeed this present point of critical suspension,\" as the OldCommentary phrases it. The sixth ray is either militant and active, or mystical,pacific and at present futile, and these two aspects at present condition theUnited States. The keynote of this world centre is \"I light the Way\" and this isthe privilege of the States if its people so choose and permit worldwidehumanitarian, self-sacrifice (self-initiated) and firm decision to stand byrighteousness to govern their present attitudes and policies. This is slowlycoming to pass and the selfish voices of the blind idealists, the fearful andthe separative are dying out. All this is happening under the inspiration ofservice, motivated by love. Thus the two major democracies can eventuallyrestore world order, negate the old order of selfishness and aggression andusher in the new order of world understanding, world sharing and world peace.Peace will be the result of understanding and sharing and not the origin of themas the pacifists so often imply.The force pouring through Darjeeling at this time is that of the first Ray ofWill or Power. The egoic ray of India is the first ray and hence the immediateeffect of the inpouring Shamballa force is to stimulate the will-to-power of alldictators, whether they are the would-be world dictators [524] such as Hitlerand his group of evil men, ecclesiastical dictators in any religion, businessdictators in any business group in any part of the world or those minordictators, the tyrant in the home. It is interesting to note that the keynote ofIndia is \"I hide the light\" and this has been interpreted to mean that the lightpours forth from the East, and that the gift of India to the world is the lightof the Ageless Wisdom. This is true in a sense, but there is a wider and deepersense in which it will prove true. When the intent and purpose of the great Lifewhich works through Shamballa is carried out and is in process of expression, alight will be revealed which has never yet been seen or known. There is a wordin the Christian Scriptures which says \"In that light shall we see light\"; thismeans that through the medium of the light of wisdom shed abroad in our heartsthrough the Ageless Wisdom, we shall eventually see the Light of Lifeitself—something meaningless and inexplicable to humanity at present but whichwill be later revealed when the present point of crisis is surmounted. Of itsnature and its effect, I have naught to say to you at present.I would like here to interpolate some remarks. It is of deep moment to realisethat Great Britain and the United States are closely related and that thisrelation makes certain realities and activities inevitable, once the soul ofeach nation is functioning potently; and that India and Great Britain arerelated through the first ray personality of Great Britain and the egoic ray ofIndia. The implications are clear and interesting and also encouraging. Theconsciousness aspect of the British people is steadily shifting into anexpression of their second ray soul and hence their seizing upon the opportunityat this time to serve humanity at immense cost. The same thing is happening tothe American people. The problem of shifting idealisms is great, as I have [525]said, and the temptation is to hide behind the glamour of fighting for an idealrather than react to world need, and to omit to react to the ray of the soulwhich is the second ray of love.The forces flowing through Tokyo are those of the first Ray in its lowermaterialistic aspect. Japan is governed by the soul ray in the consciousness ofits leaders. Its sixth ray personality is responding to the call of the firstray energy; hence all the present unhappy attitudes and activities, and hencealso its link with Germany through the soul ray of both nations and with Italythrough the personality rays. Hence, therefore, the Axis.I would here point out that in these inter-relations is no inevitable fate orunavoidable destiny. The aim of the individual disciple is to handle the forceswhich play through him in such a manner that only constructive good caneventuate. He can misuse energy or employ it for soul ends. So it is withnations and races. The fate of the nations lies in the hands of its leadersusually; they marshal the nations' forces, focus the national intent (ifintuitive enough) and develop the characteristics of the people, leaving in factbehind them the memory of symbols of national intent, ideals or corruption. Thiscould be seen working out in a demonstrable way in the two great guiding groupsof world leaders: The three Axis groups of leaders, dominated by the evil Germangroup, with Italy and Japan fighting at intervals (consciously seldom butunconsciously often) against the evil influence, and the second group—theleaders of the Allied Cause who represent their nations. No matter what pasthistory may indicate in connection with many of the allied nations (pastaggressions, ancient cruelties and wrong doing), they sought to cooperate withthe Forces of Light [526] and endeavoured to salvage human freedom—political,religious and economic.I would also point out in passing that the two major divisions of the world—theOccident and the Orient—are also governed by certain ray energies, as follows:The Occident . . . . . . . . . . . . Soul Ray . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . Ray II Personality Ray . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ray IV The Orient . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . Soul Ray . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ray IVPersonality Ray . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ray IIII would remind you that we are in a period of shifting rays and that they changeboth for individuals and nations, for hemispheres and planets. All can move offa minor ray on to a major if destiny decrees. A study of the above tabulationwill give much light to the inter-human relation. Three great countries hold thedestiny of humanity in their hands at this time: The United States of America,Great Britain and Russia. Great fusing, racial experiments are going on in allthese lands; the rule of the people is being developed in all of them though itis as yet in an embryonic stage. In Russia it is being retarded by adictatorship which will shortly end; in the States by corrupt politics and inGreat Britain by ancient imperialistic tendencies. But democratic principles arebeing developed, if not controlling; religious unity is being established thoughit is not yet functioning and all three countries are learning very rapidly,though the United States at present is learning the most slowly.The Occident and the Orient are linked through the personality ray of theOccident and the egoic ray of the Orient and this indicates eventualunderstanding once the second ray occidental soul becomes the dominant factor.When these various relationships are somewhat grasped by the peoples of theworld you will get the clue to the various happenings taking place today andwill understand the goal [527] and the method of its attainment more clearly.There is much deep research work to be done, for the science of energyrelationships is yet in its infancy. The next few years will see it gain. Whatis really happening is a shift in the human consciousness from its focus onindividual energies, functioning through some specific ring-pass-not(individual, national, continental or racial) to a grasp of their inter-relationand effects upon each other. This science can be studied in various ways:1. From the angle of antagonisms which seem inevitable and which can beaccounted for by the ray energies and which can be offset by soul energiesrightly employed.2. From the angle of identity of forces, leading inevitably to identity ofinterests and activities.3. From the angle of fusion, of unity, of vision and of goals.4. From the angle of humanity as a whole. If it is remembered that humanity isprimarily governed by two rays (the second and the fourth) it will be found thatthose nations and countries whose governing rays are also the second and thefourth must and will play an important part in determining human destiny.Therefore, through the five major centres in the planet today, spiritual energyis streaming forth, and according to the vehicle of expression which receivesits impact so will be the reaction and activity and so will be the type ofconsciousness, interpreting and using it. The ancient occult truism remainsaccurate: \"Consciousness is dependent upon its vehicle for expression and bothare dependent upon life and energy for existence.\" This remains an immutablelaw.[528] The five cities which are the exoteric expression of the esoteric centreof force and through which the Hierarchy and Shamballa are seeking to work arethe correspondence in the planetary body to the four centres up the spine andthe ajna centre in the body of humanity and of individual man. In all threecases, they are \"living, vital, focal points of dynamic force\" to a greater orless extent. Some predominantly express soul energy and some personality force;some are influenced by Shamballa and some by the Hierarchy. The head centre ofthe Occident is beginning to react to second ray energy and the ajna centre tofourth ray energy and in this lies the hope of the race of men.3. PLANETARY AND SYSTEMIC CENTRES.I have given you here and elsewhere in my writings all that it is at this timepossible to give anent the planetary centres and the rays, including the rays ofnations and of races. You will find a wealth of information hidden in my variousstatements if due search is made and the material is gathered together into acoherent whole. I would ask you to study and compare, to read and searchtopically and to extract all that I have said about the various nations, theirgoverning constellations and their planetary rulers. There is a wide field ofresearch here. This research will fall into several categories:1. Research into the nature of man's centres, the nature and influences of theirgoverning planets, their inter-relation from the energy angle and the quality ofthe ray forces which are seeking expression, plus a knowledge of the personalityand egoic rays. Out of this will come an understanding grasp of the humanconstitution [529] which will reveal all relationships and produce two basic\"events in time\":a. The blending of the subjective and objective life of the individual in thewaking consciousness.b. A new relation established between men which will be based upon the abovefusion.2. Research into the various national centres and their esoteric rulingenergies, revealing in a more universal manner and with a wider horizon thedestiny of humanity in relation to its group units, large and small. The souland personality qualities of nations will be studied, the centres within eachnation which focus certain ray energies will be noted, and the qualitativeemanations of its five or six major cities will be investigated. Let me heregive you an instance of what I mean: the influences of New York, Washington,Chicago, Kansas City and Los Angeles will be the subject of scientific research;the psychic atmosphere and the intellectual appeal will be studied, effort willbe made to discover the soul quality and the personality nature (the spiritualand the materialistic tendencies) of these great aggregations of human beingswhich have come into expression in certain fixed localities because they areexpressions of the force centres in the vital body of the nation. Similarly, inconnection with the British Empire, a study will be made of London, Sydney,Johannesburg, Toronto and Vancouver with subsidiary studies of Calcutta, Delhi,Singapore, Jamaica and Madras which are all subjectively related in a mannerunforeseen by students at present. Under the plan and contingent upon theenergies pouring through the five planetary centres according [530] to plan,there are three great fusing energies or vital centres present upon our planet:a. Russia, fusing and blending eastern Europe and western and northern Asia.b. The United States (and later South America) fusing and blending central andwestern Europe and the entire western hemisphere.c. The British Empire, fusing and blending races and men throughout the entireworld.In the hands of these nations lies the destiny of the planet. These are thethree major world blocs from the consciousness angle and from the angle of worldsynthesis. Other and lesser nations will participate in the process with fullindependence and cooperation, voluntarily and through the perfecting of theirnational life in the interests of the whole of humanity, and through the desireto express and preserve their soul integrity and their purified national purpose(which purification is now going on). The keynote, however, of human living willbe struck by Russia, Great Britain and the United States—not because of theirpower, their historical past and their material resources or territorial extentbut because they are in a position to fuse and blend the many types, becausethey are far-visioned in their world purpose, because they are not basicallyselfish in their intent, and because the government of the peoples reaches downinto the depths of each nation and is fundamentally for the people . Their basicConstitution, Magna Charta and Bill of Rights are human. Other nations will begradually swept into line with these fundamental spiritual requirements, or—ifthey are already based on these human principles and not on [531] the rule of apowerful minority, exploiting an unhappy majority—they will cooperate freelywith these greater nations in a federation of purpose and of interests untilsuch time when all the nations of the world see the vision clear, forego theirselfish aims and agree in the unity of the work to be done for the whole.Humanity will then emerge into the light of freedom with a revealed beauty and aspiritual purpose, hitherto unknown.3. Research into the relation of the planetary centres to the systemic centres,the sacred planets and the energies pouring through them from the constellationswhich they \"rule\" in the esoteric sense. This is one of the paradoxes ofoccultism but it can be understood if the student remembers that the centres inhis etheric body rule the planet in so far as they are receptive ornon-receptive to the influences emanating from the planet, via the planetarycentres.Beginning as ever with the study of the microcosm as the clue to the macrocosm,but seeking at the same time to envisage the macrocosm in order to understandthe microcosm, man will some day establish an intelligent relation to the wholeof which he is a part and this with conscious cooperation. Thus the higher mindand the lower mind, the abstract and the concrete, the subjective and theobjective will be brought into a functioning unity and man will be whole .I cannot give you the relation of the planetary centres to the human centres orof the systemic centres to the planets. Too much knowledge would be given toosoon and prior to the time when there is enough love present in human nature tooffset the possible misuse of energy with [532] its often disastrousconsequences. The colours, the mathematical rate of the higher vibrations whichemanate from the centres—individual, planetary and systemic—and the quality(esoterically understood) of the energies must be the subject of human researchand self-ascertained. The clues and the hints have been given in the AgelessWisdom. The slower method of research is the safer at present. In the nextcentury and early in the century an initiate will appear and will carry on theirteaching. It will be under the same \"impression\" for my task is not yetcompleted and this series of bridging Treatises between the material knowledgeof man and the science of the initiates has still another phase to run. But theremainder of this century must be dedicated to rebuilding the shrine of man'sliving, to reconstructing the form of humanity's life, to reconstituting the newcivilisation upon the foundations of the old and to the reorganising of thestructures of world thought, world politics, plus the redistribution of theworld's resources in conformity to divine purpose. Then and only then will it bepossible to carry the revelation further.All this is dependent upon the triumph of the Forces of Light and the consequentvictory of those who stand for human freedom. If the forces of materialism andcruelty triumph and selfish and wicked national interests and ambitions hadprevailed, the revelation would still come but very much later. The issue is notin the balance and there is no need to despair. The courage of those fightingfor freedom remains unimpaired. The Hierarchy stands . Light is breaking in theworld as the realities of the situation emerge more clearly.Be of good cheer for there is no true defeat of the human spirit; there is nofinal extinction of the divine in man, for divinity ever rises triumphant fromthe darkest [533] pit of hell. There is need however to overcome the inertia ofthe material nature in response to human need, individually and by the nationsnot engrossed with the essentials of the situation. This shows signs ofhappening. There is no power on Earth which can prevent the advance of mantowards his destined goal and no combination of powers can hold him back."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V - THREE MAJOR CONSTELLATIONS AND THE ZODIAC[537] There exists at this time an inter-relation between three of theconstellations upon which I would like somewhat to enlarge, because theirpotency and the climax of their inter-relation is being reached at this time.From 1975 on, that potency will greatly lessen until it fades out. The period ofthis interplay of three major energies and their focussed potent effect upon ourplanet began in 1875, achieved momentum in 1925, will reach its highestexpression (for good or evil) in 1945 and will then decline slowly until 1975.These three constellations are: Leo, Capricorn and Pisces. These are curiouslyand most mysteriously related to the fourth kingdom in nature and therefore tothe evolution and the destiny of the human family. Add to these the emergingenergy of Aquarius, and you have four energies which are playing upon thevehicles of men and producing peculiar effects—both destructive andconstructive.Twice before has this relation and intensification of vibration occurred: At thetime of the coming of the Sons of Mind to the Earth during the Lemurian age andonce in the Atlantean period at the climax of the conflict between the Lords ofthe Dark Face and the Lords of the Shining Countenance. (See Volume II of TheSecret Doctrine or the Vishnu Purana . A.A.B.) In the earlier activity, thefourth active constellation was Gemini and in the Atlantean [538] it wasSagittarius. The effect then was on the physical plane (the earliest was on themental) and the great Flood eventuated to which the Bible bears testimony. Itbrought about the destruction of the humanity of the time, but released theindwelling life for further experience and development.1. LEO, CAPRICORN AND PISCES.The effects produced are mass effects and the Rulers of these constellationswhich move into activity at this time are those listed in one of the earliertabulations which I gave you.Leo.—Ruler: The Sun, veiling Uranus, the planet of occultism, and that whichgoverns group relations, organisations and the eleventh House. It relates theLeo influence to Aquarius.Capricorn.—Ruler: Venus, governing the second House, which is concerned witheconomics, the distribution of money and metals and which rules Taurus, the“seed house” of illumination and the new emerging light. Venus also rules Libraexoterically and the seventh House wherein enemies are recognised and unions andfriendships achieved.Pisces.—Ruler: Pluto, governing the eighth House, the house of death, ofdissolution, of detachment and ruling Scorpio, the sign of testing and ofdiscipleship.This tabulation and its inferred relationships warrant careful study in thelight of modern affairs and the present world situation. From the angle of theray energies involved and seeking to control human life, you have the influenceof the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Law, Order and Magic, [539] the fifth Ray ofConcrete Knowledge, or Science and the first Ray of Will unitedly bringing aboutfundamental changes, and ushering in the new era. This combination isterrifically potent and brings about the precipitation of inner forces, anincreased activity of the lower mind and an outpouring of the Shamballaforce—all three of which can be seen functioning in the field of the planetarylife today as never before. The greater effect is produced owing to the greatlyincreased sensitivity of mankind, compared to the two other times in which (incyclic evolution) these three constellations were active. The combination isseen demonstrating in human affairs today. It was responsible for theorganisation which lay behind the World War—an organisation involving all threelevels in the threefold world of human evolution and which affects also thethree kingdoms in nature, climaxing in the fourth. It is responsible for the useof mental power on a vast scale, notably in the material sense as at present andfor the achievement of human desire, plus the self-will of an evil few, who,because of the seeds of evil in their own nature, respond to the lower aspectsof this force. It is also responsible for the steadily mounting will-to-good ofthe awakening many.A close analysis of these constellations, their planetary rulers and the rayforces which these transmit will clarify the world issues in an amazing manner,plus an appreciation of the houses in which these effects will primarily befelt. The following brief tabulation may prove useful, even if it is only arepetition of that earlier said:Constellation Ruler Ray House Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Sun (Uranus) . .Seventh . . . . . Eleventh Capricorn . . . . . . . . Venus . . . . . . . . . . .. Fifth . . . . . . . Second and Seventh Pisces . . . . . . . . . . . Pluto . .. . . . . . . . . . First . . . . . . . Eighth[540] The energies poured out, therefore, will be felt primarily in thoseaspects of human living which are influenced by the rulers of certain houses.The seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Organisation is felt in the house ofrelationships, of organisations and of mutual effort and of aspiration (eithertowards good or evil). The forces of this ray work out on the seventh orphysical plane—the plane whereon major changes in all forms are made and onwhich the disciple must firmly stand as he takes initiation.This seventh ray sweeps into organised and directed activity the world of forcesupon the outer sphere of manifestation, and produces the precipitation of Karma,which, in this case leads to:1. The working out into expression of all the subjective evil of the life ofhumanity, thus producing the world war.2. The initiation of the planetary Logos and—with Him—of all who take theirstand upon the side of the Forces of Light. This takes various forms as far ashumanity is concerned:a. The initiation of the consciousness of the masses of men into the AquarianAge, bringing them under the new influences and potencies, and enabling them tomake a response of which they would not otherwise be capable.b. The initiation of the aspirants of the world on to the Path of AcceptedDiscipleship.c. The bringing about of certain major initiations in the case of those worlddisciples who are ready enough and strong enough to take them.[541] In spite of the vast destruction everywhere, the work of the seventh rayis being increasingly felt; the destruction of the forces of evil is going oneven though at great cost to the Forces of Light; simultaneously there is aregrouping and a rearrangement of human attitudes and thought; this is broughtabout as a result of the tremendous demand upon the world thinkers for directionand guidance. Thus the nebulous structure and the dim outlines of the New Agecivilisation can already be seen.The underlying spirit of freedom will triumph as it is organised into revoltagainst slavery. To this end, the seventh ray will increasingly makecontribution.Leo, the constellation in which the keynote is full self-consciousness, isbecoming increasingly dominant. The issues involved in today’s situation arebecoming clearer in the minds of the masses of the people; they can and will actwith full awareness and intentional conscious purpose when the right time comesand will understand the implications and the price involved in a manner nothitherto possible. Hence the meaning back of my reiterated statement that theissues and determinations of the present situation are in the hands of humanityitself. The “stars in their courses” will aid humanity or bring destruction,according to human determinations. Men can achieve liberty and organise for theNew Age with its unique civilisation and constructive synthesis, or they cancommit suicide (if I may speak symbolically) and hand over their immediatefuture to the forces of evil and of death. These work for the death of all thetrue values and of all for which the human spirit has fought.The self-consciousness aspect of the human being is [542] being steadilyexpanded under this major interplay and through the forces transmitted byUranus, via the eleventh house, and will ultimately give place to groupconsciousness and group relationships and group work. Hence the trend towardsamalgamation today, towards federation, spheres of action and the many groupswhich distinguish increasingly human intercourse. The group spirit and the formsthrough which it will express itself are being increasingly demonstrated andthis constitutes a veritable initiation for the race. It is the emergence of theglory of the human spirit in a more definite and arresting way and involves anorientation towards freedom which will later stand in the historical records asthe outstanding characteristic of this age of major conflict. Humanity is todayparticipating in the preparatory tests for initiation, the initiation of theworld disciple. Great is your privilege to be taking part in this. Forget notthat eleven is the number of the Initiate and that today it is the eleventhhouse which is so dominant; forget not that Aquarius, the eleventh sign, is thesign of universal relationships, interplay and consciousness. For all this, thecombination of signs, Leo, Capricorn and Pisces—is preparing the race.The evil men who guided the destiny of Germany talked of world groups and of theEuropean Order of Nations but it was a grouping around Germany as the centre andfor the selfish interests of Germany. The grouping which is a part of the divinePlan is not around any one nation but a grouping based on the ideal ofbrotherhood, on the will-to-good and on the freedom of the whole. One expressesa selfish materialistic distortion and the other a spiritual objective.Capricorn is related, as you have been told, to initiation; [543] it is also thesign of the coming world Saviour and these higher aspects of the Capricornianinfluences can be potently demonstrated if humanity so wills it and will takeadvantage of the Venusian influence to use the mind as the reflector of soulpurpose. If this does not take place, the present situation will turn intosomething far worse—a situation wherein the mass of men will be “re-initiatedinto the Earth and forced to turn their backs upon the dawning light.” A darkperiod of civilisation will ensue. Instead of the dark cave of initiationwherein the light of the initiate’s own nature illumines the darkness and sodemonstrates his command of light, the dark cave of materialism and of physical,animal control will take the place of the “lighted Way.” The earthy aspect ofCapricorn, the lowest concrete aspect of the mind and an increased control bythe Taurian spirit in its worst form will take the place of the divinepossibility of entrance into greater light, the manifestation of the soul natureand the recognition of the “light which is found in the eye of the Bull.”Such are the possibilities confronting the world of men today; the issue isdependent upon the final triumph of the Forces of Light (working through theAllied nations) or on the control of the forces of materialism. Germanyrepresented materialism in the West and Japan in the East. I would also add thatthose who in both nations (and there are many such) represent the “lighted Way”were so imprisoned in their environment and so dominated in their personalitiesby the thoughtform of their powerful rulers that for them right action wasimpossible. It is this thought which prompts the Hierarchy to renewed effort.The Forces of Light recognise and work for the spiritual good of all people,irrespective of their national relations. They are [544] working for the releaseof Germany from the glamour which descended upon her people. The Hierarchy makesa distinction between the bewildered mass, the wrongly educated youth and theobsessed leaders in all branches of the government. The latter are “shells,”obsessed by evil entities and hence their dynamic, one-pointed potency, hencealso their extreme skill and cunning, based on very ancient evil experience andhence also the well-nigh ludicrous falsity of their propaganda. They are thespirit of materialism embodied, devoid of all true feeling and perception,lacking the light of love and understanding, but powerfully animated by theenergy of substance itself. It is time that men woke up to the nature of thesebeings who sought (under the present grouping of constellations) to enslave therace. The earthly influence of Capricorn made their activity possible; theythemselves have been evoked out of their evil past by the material side ofhumanity itself and the potency of the massed selfishness of mankind. In likemanner, the Forces of Light can be evoked in tremendous potency but only by themassed aspiration and spiritual desires of the peoples of the Earth. Of thisevocation, there are already signs.The Venusian influence—as you will have noted—brings in likewise the influencesof Libra. You find today a cycle wherein an appropriate balance or point ofequilibrium has been brought about which is a correspondence to the great pointof balance on the Path of Involution when spirit and matter balanced each other,making the upward arc of evolution the next possible step. This time thebalancing is on mental levels; in the earlier crisis, it was on the physicalplane. This point of equilibrium is to humanity, to the Sons of Mind, what theearlier point of crisis was to the planetary [545] Logos. This is a fact to beremembered and given due place in your thinking. The problem to be solved is:Which aspect of humanity will finally triumph and so disturb the balance byachieving dominance—spirit or matter, soul or personality? Such is the nature ofthese points of crisis. As in the planetary crisis, if spirit should triumph, anew feature, function or quality of divinity will begin to manifest—the highestmind. In the human crisis, the same thing is possible. If the spirit of mantriumphs, then the aspect of true love in its divine nature and with its groupemphasis will be possible. Such are the issues involved.To bring about the full presentation of the choice and to indicate the modewhereby the spirit of man can triumph, the influence of Pisces was called in orrather evoked. It is conditions which evoke, aided at times by voiced Words ofPower on the part of the Hierarchy. Pisces, through its ruler, Pluto (rulingboth the mass and the disciples esoterically), necessitated the triumph ofdeath—not necessarily physical death—leading to the dissolution of the form ofman. It is frequently the death or ending of old forms of civilisations whichcyclically come and go; of religious teaching when it does not serve the need ofthe spiritual nature of the people (as is today the case); of educationalprocesses which fail to educate the developing nature of man and serve only todelude and imprison. When I say this, I mean not the death of religion or offorms of thought. I refer here to death as the Great Releaser, which shattersthe forms which are bringing death to that which is embodied. It is to thisphilosophic death in its lowest aspect that Germany has responded. Thedestruction of religion which Germany sought to bring about is not a prelude tothe establishment of a better approach to divinity but the effort [546] to evokethe ancient gods, to deify the forms of matter and to make the state the supremeend of men’s lives; the spirit of love and of individual right relations are notknown—those relations which are so basically characteristic of the Kingdom ofGod.The completely atheistic approach of Russia to the problem of religion at thetime of, and during the period of, the revolution is much more sound than theGerman approach. The spirit of man in its essential divinity can be trusted toarise unhurt from the experience in answer to the call of the undying spirit.This call can sound forth clearly in a void and be evoked by time andcircumstance—unopposed if the only difficulty with which it is confronted is thespirit of agnosticism and an attitude of questioning. But the imposition of theancient myths in an effort to still the demand for truth and the carefullyplanned attack upon the Christ of the world is dangerous, evil, and will causeretrogression. Of these, the rulers of Germany were guilty. They did not succeedin quenching the spiritual life of the nation because religion in Germany wasnot corrupt as it was in Russia and needed not such a drastic purification.These are points which thinkers would do well to remember. In mystical Russia,the seeds of the spiritual life are emerging to fresh beauty and a triumphantreligious ideal is on its way to manifest; in Germany, ancient crystallisedforms of belief are met with something more ancient still and the combination ofworld dislike and decadent forms will make the lot of the German people one ofgreat tragedy. In the consequent struggle for that which is spiritually aliveand in the effort to regain belief in the realities of divine revelation, and inthe determination to right the evil wrought by her rulers to the world, Germanymay some day regain the expression of soul life. To this end, she must be firstreleased [547] from evil rule and then aided to regain her spiritual standing.Pluto, therefore, comes into full force and expression in order to stage thetestings of the world disciple and to this end brings in the potency of Scorpio,the sign of discipleship. Under these influences, the death of forms musteventuate leaving the disciple free; the dissolution of old group structures ofthought, embodying worn-out ideas and ideals must necessarily supervene;crystallised old forms must dissolve and disappear, but in their place theundying spirit—impressed by revelation and sensitive to the emerging newconcepts of truth—will create the needed new forms of appropriate expression.Such are the influences which today are dominating the world, finding expressionaccording to the type of vehicle which reacts to their impact. The type ofconscious response and resultant activity is—as the occultist wellknows—dependent upon the quality of the vehicle which is receptive to theapproach of any type of energy. The interplay of the energy and the vehicle thenproduces consciousness of some kind. This is a basic and unalterable law.In the few things which I have been able to say anent these constellations andtheir relation to our planet at this time, I trust I have made clear andpractical something which esoteric astrologers need unceasingly to grasp—thefact that once it has been established which constellations are at any one timeinfluencing our Earth, which planets—exoteric and esoteric—are transmittingtheir influence and which rays are consequently active, it should be possible toprove then the fact of these distributed energies by the appearance upon Earthand among men of their appropriate results, and the expected response. [548]2. THREE MAJOR PLANETARY INFLUENCES TODAY.Within the solar system itself, three of the sacred planets are peculiarlyactive. They are:1. Uranus . This planet is the exoteric ruler of Aquarius; it is also theesoteric ruler of Libra and the hierarchical ruler of Aries. It is peculiarlyactive at this time and brings in the energy of the seventh ray. The circulatingof its energies can be portrayed by the following symbol or diagram:[Image00018.jpg]This triple inflow of seventh ray energy, coloured by the force of three greatconstellations, is potent to effect major changes in our little planet. It isinteresting to realise that Aries, the Inaugurator, is rendered effective on theEarth through the organising potency of Uranus. Aries is the source, thebeginning and the initiator of the New Age and its coming civilisations, of theappearance of the kingdom of God on earth and also of the individual initiateinto the Mysteries. Aquarius is the present Determiner of the future. That whichis now initiated in Aries will become manifested in Aquarius, and Libra willenforce the achievement of a point of balance or (esoterically speaking) of the“escape from opposing forces at the midway point between the source and thegoal.”2. Mercury is the expression of fourth ray energy and this is, as you know,peculiarly related to the fourth [549] kingdom in nature, the human kingdom. Itis the esoteric ruler of Aries (hence it “leads into the mysteries”) and is alsothe exoteric ruler of Gemini, which is the sign of the major opposites as far ashumanity is concerned, because it signifies soul and personality, consciousnessand form; it is also the exoteric ruler of Virgo, the Mother of theChrist-Child, or the form and that which indwells the form. It is, finally, thehierarchical ruler of Scorpio, which is the sign of discipleship.This, therefore, brings into a close relation four great constellations, each ofwhich has a peculiar relation to the dualities with which man has a definiteevolutionary concern. These are expressed in a unique manner for humanitythrough Aries, Gemini, Virgo, and Scorpio and the following diagram isdescriptive of the nature of that relation:[Image00019.jpg]When visualising these diagrams, the symbol should be seen in rapid revolution.Mercury, the Messenger of the Gods, carries to humanity a certain type of forceand this precipitates a point of crisis; it brings about the next greatrevolution which will lead mankind on to new experience, and to the revelationof the divinity which it is the destiny of man to reveal.3. Saturn . This planet applies the tests and is so chosen or invoked becausethe third ray is not only its particular ray but is also the ray of our planet,the Earth. The two notes synchronise. Saturn is also the hierarchical ruler[550] of Libra and, therefore, it brings to the manifestation of mankind and tothe various hierarchies involved, a point of crisis to which the clue and theoutcome lies in the recognition of balance . As Saturn also controls Capricornin two of its three expressions or fields of influence, it is powerful in thethree fields—exoteric, esoteric and hierarchical—and if you will relate what Ihere say to what I have said in an earlier part of this treatise re Capricorn,you will see how the sign of initiation hovers over our planet as well as overthe destiny of the individual disciple. You have therefore an expression of thethird ray force which the following diagram makes clear:[Image00020.jpg]Saturn rules one of the decanates of Aquarius.This makes factual and clear that at this time, the signs of balance and ofinitiation can be intelligently used to produce effects on our Earth and thisthey will immutably do.These statements conclude what I feel it necessary to say at this time.Initiation—characterised by self-initiation—is the demand of man today. Thestars declare it and decree it. The Hierarchy therefore intentionallycollaborates. The crying demand and aspirations of man indicate appreciation ofthe opportunity and recognised understanding of the proved necessity. The Spiritof Life enforces this."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI - THE THREE CROSSES[553] I shall not be able to handle the subject of the three zodiacalCrosses—the Mutable, Fixed and Cardinal Crosses—in any detail, owing to the factthat they are concerned with the wholes or with the syntheses of manifestationand with the unified experience of an incarnating entity, be it God or man. Theycan, therefore, be truly comprehended only by those with an inclusiveconsciousness, i.e., with an initiate-awareness. Some general comments can,however, be made.These three Crosses are as you know:1. The Cross of the Hidden Christ —The Mutable Cross.a. This is the Cross of the four major energies which produce the conditioningcircumstances which transform animal man into an aspirant.b. It is, therefore, the Cross of the personality or of the steadily developingand finally integrating human being. This takes place at first in response tocircumstance and later to soul inclination.c. It is the Cross of temporal and temporary change, of fluidity and of thoseconstantly altering environments which drive the soul within the form from oneextreme of experience to another, so that the life shuttles between the pairs ofopposites. [554]d. It is the Cross of the responsive form, nurturing and developing the life ofthe indwelling Christ, the hidden Soul or Lord of Being.The four arms of this Cross are Gemini—Virgo—Sagittarius—Pisces. It is sometimescalled the Common Cross because it conditions the common herd, the mass ofhumanity.2. The Cross of the Crucified Christ —The Fixed Cross.a. This is the Cross composed of the four energies which condition the life ofthe man who is first a probationary disciple and then an accepted or pledgeddisciple.b. It is outstandingly the Cross of the soul. The man who is upon the FixedCross is becoming increasingly aware of its direction and influences and doesnot respond as blindly as does the man upon the Mutable Cross. He does not“mount this Cross of Right Direction” in a technical sense until he has attainedsome measure of soul contact and has had some touch of illumination and ofspiritual intuition—no matter how fleeting that touch may have been.c. It is the Cross of “fixed vision and of that immovable intent which draws theman from points of light to blazing solar radiance.” The man upon the FixedCross says: “I am the soul and here I stand. Naught shall remove my feet fromoff the narrow place whereon I stand. I face the light. I am the Light and inthat light shall I see Light.”d. It is the Cross whose four energies blend with [555] and transmit theenergies of the solar system itself. This it can do because the man upon theFixed Cross is becoming increasingly conscious of issues which are larger thanhimself, more engrossing than his previous interests and which concern humanityin its relation to the solar forces and not just to the planetary forces. He isbecoming sensitive to a larger whole.e. The energies of this Cross continue to evoke response until the time of thethird initiation.The four arms of this Cross are Taurus—Leo—Scorpio—Aquarius. It is called theFixed Cross because the man is stretched upon it by the directed choice andimmovable intent of his soul. From that decision there is no turning back.3. The Cross of the Risen Christ —The Cardinal Cross.a. This is the Cross whereon, under the occult paradox and in time and space,the Spirit is crucified. Its four energies govern and direct the soul as itmoves forward upon the Path of Initiation. Necessarily, as it deals with soexalted a state of consciousness, there is but little I can say anent this Crossexcept the vaguest generalities.b. It is, therefore, pre-eminently the Cross of Initiation and of “beginnings.”It concerns fundamentally “the beginning of the endless Way of Revelation” whichstarts when Nirvana is entered and for which all the previous stages of the Pathof Evolution have been but preparatory.The following quotation may carry understanding and help to illumine this mostdifficult [556] subject, indicating the significance of this Cardinal Cross as aconsummating influence and revealing that which lies ahead of those who attainhierarchical standing:“All beauty, all goodness, all that makes for the eradication of sorrow andignorance upon the Earth must be devoted to the Great Consummation. Then whenthe Lords of Compassion shall have spiritually civilised the Earth and made ofit a Heaven, there shall be revealed to the Pilgrims the Endless Path whichreaches to the Heart of the Universe. Man, then no longer man, will transcendnature and impersonally, yet consciously, in at-one-ment with all EnlightenedOnes, help to fulfil the Law of the Higher Evolution, of which Nirvana is butthe beginning,” (Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines. Page 12.)c. It is the Cross of the “widespread arms, the open heart and the higher mind,”for those who lie upon this Cross know and enjoy the significances underlyingthe words: Omnipresence and Omniscience, and are in process of unfolding thehigher phases of Being which we inadequately cover by the word, Omnipotence.d. The energies of the Cardinal Cross blend with the energies to which we cangive no greater name than cosmic energy even though that word is meaningless.They carry the quality of the One about Whom Naught may be Said and are“tinctured with the Light of the seven solar systems” of which our solar systemis one.e. The scope and cycle of its influence in the life of the initiate is utterlyunknown even to our planetary [557] Logos Who is Himself stretched upon its“widespread arms.”1. THE CROSS OF THE HIDDEN CHRIST.Speaking generally, therefore, the Mutable Cross governs the form or bodynature, controls the whole life cycle of the individual soul through the stagesof the lower experiences of humanity, the strictly human stages, and theintegrating processes of personality development until the man stands forth asan aligned person, slowly reorienting himself to a higher vision, a widerhorizontal and vertical grasp of reality and thus becomes the aspirant. ThisCross governs the lower triad in manifestation and rules in the three worlds ofhuman evolution. The Fixed Cross governs the soul which is now conscious withinthe human form and in the three worlds, but controls throughout what is called“the five worlds of human attainment”—the three strictly human levels ofactivity and the two superhuman, i.e., the lower trinity and the SpiritualTriad. It deals with the entire life of soul experience and expression after theMutable Cross has effectively forced the man on to the Path of Purification andof Discipleship. It is concerned with the integration of soul and personalityand their complete blending or fusion. The Cardinal Cross governs themanifestation of the Monad in all its glory and beauty, and this cycle ofinfluence falls into two stages: the one in which the Monad expresses itselfupon the six planes of manifestation in “wisdom, strength and beauty” throughthe medium of the integrated soul and personality. This is a relatively briefstage. Second, the stage wherein—withdrawn and abstracted from those forms ofBeing—”the ONE proceeds upon the higher Way and passes on to [558] realmsunknown e’en to the highest of the Sons of God upon our Earth.”It might be added that the Mutable Cross is the conditioning influence in thatgreat planetary centre which we call the human; that the Fixed Cross isparamountly the major controlling set of energies governing, and beingtransmitted by, the centre which we call the planetary Hierarchy; whilst theCardinal Cross rules and conditions (in a manner unknown to men) that greatplanetary centre to which we give the name Shamballa.You will see, therefore, how stupendous is my theme. Only those, may I againrepeat, who can think in terms of one or other of the three above Wholes, willknow whereof I speak; lesser minds will get a general picture or vision oftranscendental possibilities which will aid them to an expansion ofconsciousness, but what I say will remain far-off in the realm of the(temporarily) unattainable.Will it clarify the subject technically and academically if I point out that—1. The Mutable Cross is the Cross of the Holy Spirit, of the third Person of theChristian Trinity, as it organises substance and evokes sensitive response fromsubstance itself.2. The Fixed Cross is the Cross of the Son of God, of the second Person of theTrinity, driven through love to incarnate in matter and to be consciouslycrucified upon the Cross of matter.3. The Cardinal Cross is the Cross of the Father, the first aspect of the sacredTrinity, Who sent forth the Holy Spirit (the Breath) because the Mind of Godvisioned a destiny for matter which had been long in coming. [559] Now that the“time was at hand,” the Son fulfilled the law in cooperation with the HolySpirit and this in response to the fiat of the Father.These three Crosses are, in their totality of manifestation, related to thethree basic energies which brought the solar system into being; they constitutethe three major and synthetic expressions of the supernal Will, motivated bylove and expressed through activity. Upon these Crosses, the ability to see theWhole, purpose-motive-expression, life-quality-appearance, shifts and changes.Upon the Mutable Cross , the crucified man sees naught of the picture. Hesuffers, agonises, desires, strives, is the apparent victim of circumstances,and is distinguished by a veiled vision and inchoate longings. These graduallytake shape until he reaches the stage of acquiescence and aspiration . Then hefinds himself upon the Fixed Cros s and begins to grasp the whole of the purposeof experience upon the Mutable Cross (as far as humanity is concerned) and torealise that there is a hierarchical purpose which can only be grasped by theman who is willing to be crucified upon that Cross. He reaches the stage ofresponsibility, self-awareness and right direction. His orientation is now “thespiritually vertical which involves the inclusive horizontal.” At this stage,the Plan of the Logos begins to take shape in his consciousness. Upon theCardinal Cross , the purpose and the unified consummations of the two earliercrucifixions become almost blindingly apparent and a vision of the unifiedintent of the three Persons of the underlying Trinity (each upon His Own Cross)emerges with clarity.Perhaps the simplicity of the following three symbols may serve somewhat toclarify that which I have tried to impart. [560]The Mutable Cross of material change and constant movement can be depicted bythe swastika.[Image00021.jpg]The man is unconscious of the nature of the four entering energies andinterprets little in terms of the soul. The energies make their impact upon himand drive him into material activity. This Cross of the personality dedicatesthe man who is crucified thereon to material ends in order that he may learneventually their divine use. It is in the lower aspect of this Cross that theNazis chose this symbol as theirs; they were expressing, at the close of thematerial cycle of human existence, the false and evil use of matter, of whichseparativeness, cruelty and selfishness is the key. The misuse of substance andthe prostitution of matter and form to evil ends is the sin against the HolySpirit. It might be said that the swastika “drives into danger dire and intoevil ways, those whose greed is great and who see no beauty in the dawning lightand who know no love of human lives.” To those who respond not to the loweraspects and effects of the whirling Cross (as it is sometimes called) “theswastika flings them from itself and far afield until they come to rest upon theCross of chosen crucifixion,” the Fixed Cross of the pledged disciple.The symbol of the Fixed Cross (as far as humanity is concerned) might bedepicted thus:[Image00022.jpg]Here you have the [561] Cross of Humanity. On this Cross, the man is illuminedand conscious of the effects of the completed cycle (indicated by the circle) ofthe four energies to which he was subjected upon the Mutable Cross.The symbol for the Cardinal Cross is more complicated and can be portrayed thus:[Image00023.jpg]Here you have the triangle of manifested Monad, plus the three cycles of fourenergies, focussed and blended in unity; you have also the line of evolution(the evolution of consciousness) going down deep into, and becoming inclusive ofmatter and at the same time reaching out into the “Spaces of Divinity.”Much that can be said anent the three Crosses has been already covered inscattered form when dealing separately with each of the twelve signs of thezodiac; it need not here be repeated. This Treatise, like The Secret Doctrine ,is designed to instigate research and the power to delve and seek, because thatprocess has a definite effect upon the cells of the brain and leads to a neededstimulation. In the study of the Crosses, the true meaning of their influencewill only appear as you begin to think in terms of synthesis or of the relationof the four streams of energy, flowing unitedly upon and through any form ofdivine manifestation. This is by no means an easy thing to do, for the abilityto think synthetically is only just beginning to appear in the foremost minds ofthe race. It can be illustrated, and then only analytically (which ever negatessynthesis) by remarking in connection with the Mutable Cross, for instance, thatthe [562] synthesis of evolution, its problem and its goal all appear in aunited, whole presentation when the influences are viewed as follows:1. Gemini—the presentation of duality.2. Virgo—the presentation of blending life and form.3. Sagittarius—the presentation of focussed energy.4. Pisces—the presentation of a blended radiance.This culminating radiance is the result of the focus of life, intention, andenergy into a “radiant point of power.” You have been told that in connectionwith the Mutable Cross at this time the sign Pisces is the most potent and whenthe work of the Mutable Cross has been accomplished, the acquiescing disciplepasses onto the Fixed Cross and prepares for the tests and trials of initiation.This is expressed for us in the occult symbology of the Old Commentary asfollows:“The Light shines forth because the greater light and the lesser light approachand then invoke each other. Their blended lights, though not yet one radiantsun, are merging fast. These blended lights reveal the Lighted Way.The man beholds himself taking this other Way, the Way of lighted wholes; thisleads from form to soul, from dark to light and thus around the Wheel. Retracingthus his steps and backward moving on the Way (the reversed wheel of the zodiac,A.A.B.) he forward moves.A new light enters in. The Seven Sisters play their part (the Pleiades are inTaurus, the first sign of the Fixed Cross) and then three lights shine forth.And thus one radiant sun appears.”[563] The theme of all three Crosses is fusion and integration. The fusion ofthe personality into one functioning whole; the fusion of soul and personalityconsciously; the fusion of the threefold expression of divinity—Monad, ego andpersonality—so that there is an appearance of the blended energies. The keynoteof their influences is the power to include and the full expressionsimultaneously, in time and space, of the vertical and the horizontal life.It should be noted that there are seven forms of light, related to the substanceof the seven planes. These are stimulated and enhanced by the twelve forms oflight of the twelve Creative Hierarchies, related each of them to one or otherof the twelve signs of the zodiac. On this I may not enlarge as it concerns themysteries of the higher initiations. I simply make the statement so that it maybe appreciated by you as an occult fact to the proof of which you may not yethave access. A paralleling statement would be that the light of the sevencentres in man (when enhanced by the light of the seven planetary centres) andthe five kingdoms in nature (7+5=12), plus the twelve lights of the zodiac willproduce a consummation of “light” effectiveness which will make possible theexpression of the whole. This, through the medium of humanity. This is a basicstatement which means little to you as yet but which will—in the nextcentury—form a seed thought or “key sound” for the next revelation of theAgeless Wisdom.Until the significance of the three Crosses is understood more fully andsynthetically by astrologers and astrological investigators, it is almostimpossible to find the needed words which will convey clearly the intendedmeaning. There has been no real attempt as yet on the part of astrologers (eventhe most advanced) to arrive at a general or synthetic understanding of theeffect of the Crosses [564] upon humanity. All that has as yet been conveyed isthe effect of one arm of the Cross upon the subject born in a particular sign.But there is a fusion of energies to be noted when, esoterically speaking, man“stands at the midway point where the four energies meet.” The man whose Sunsign is in Gemini, for instance, is subjected to the forces flowing through theCross as whole, unless he is a very low grade human being; he will be sensitiveto the influences of the other three signs when they sweep into power as thelesser zodiac of the year plays its part. Later, when the practical value ofesoteric astrology is better understood, men will avail themselves of the threeenergies of the three other signs of the Cross in which the Sun sign finds aplace. This is a future development of the science of esoteric astrology.Putting it into the simplest terms and thereby necessarily limitingsignificances, a man will endeavour, when in Sagittarius, to practiseone-pointedness along some one line; when in Virgo, he will know thatopportunity to bring the form more under the influence of the hidden Christ ispossible and that, in Pisces, sensitivity to the higher impression is his rightand privilege. All these four possibilities, in regard to the advanced initiateare beautifully demonstrated for us in the life of Jesus, the Master on thesixth ray.The Gemini aspect of His life is shown in the perfect fusion of the basicduality found in humanity: the human and the divine.The Virgo aspect came into expression in His twelfth year when He said: “Wist yenot that I must be about My Father’s business,” thereby indicating thesubordination of the form life to the will of the indwelling Christ; this wasconsummated when “divinity descended upon Him” at the Baptism.[565] The Sagittarian energy enabled Him to say, when confronted with fullknowledge of the imminent sacrifice which He would have to make: “I must go upto Jerusalem,” and, we read, He then “set His face” and trod the Path of theSaviour, leading to the liberation of humanity.The Piscean aspect in its highest expression is demonstrated by His sensitivityto immediate and unbroken contact with His “Father in Heaven”; He was inconstant communication with the Monad, thereby proving to the world that He wasinitiated into states of consciousness of which the third initiation is but thebeginning.All the three Crosses are shown as functioning simultaneously in His life—athing hitherto unknown in the perfection which He displayed—a perfection ofperfect responsiveness and perfect demonstration of result as well, giving us amanifestation and an example of the fusion of the twelve energies in one divinePersonality (expressing Individuality) on the physical plane. Let me brieflycomplete the demonstration of this truth—the truth that in the initiate of thehigher degrees, all the twelve zodiacal energies can focus simultaneously andproduce a complete exhibition of divinity, as it is intended eventually toexpress itself through humanity on this planet. I have given you the expressionof the Mutable Cross. We will take the other two, in connection with the Christand with the Cosmic Christ.THE FIXED CROSSTaurus.—Christ said (as have all the Sons of God Who know the true significanceof the Fixed Cross), “I am the Light of the world,” and he added, “if thine eyebe single thy whole body shall he full of light.” Taurus is, as you have heard,the Mother of Illumination, and [566] the “eye of the Bull” is the symbol of theeye to which Christ made reference.Leo.—This is the sign of self-conscious identity. This is testified to by Christin the words He spoke to His disciples: “What shall it profit a man if he gainthe whole world and lose his soul?” or his own centre of self-consciousness—thatsignificant point of attainment which must precede all the more inclusive statesof consciousness.Scorpio.—The significance of this sign in the life of Christ has been deletedfrom The New Testament , but has been preserved for us in the ancient Christianlegend that—in the cradle itself—Christ killed or strangled two serpents, thusreferring to the pairs of opposites which could no longer control Him.Aquarius.—The expression of this influence has been beautifully given to us inthe story of the Last Supper. Christ sent His disciples into the city to findthe man “bearing a pitcher of water” upon his shoulder. This is the symbol ofthe sign Aquarius—the sign in which the universality of the water of life willbecome a factor in human consciousness; then we shall indeed all sit downeventually to the communion of bread and wine. He referred indirectly to thesame idea when He spoke of Himself as the “water of life,” assuaging the thirstof humanity.Thus, through the use of the energies of these four signs of the Fixed Cross,Christ demonstrated perfection. [567]THE CARDINAL CROSSIn the four signs of this Cross we find Him also manifesting their energies intheir highest forms (from the angle of human understanding), though these aremore by implication than by direct statement.Aries.—This sign, which is the sign of beginnings, provided the impulse andenergy which enabled Him to inaugurate the Christian era; it initiated, throughHim, the “age of Love” which is only now beginning to take form, and its potencyis now so great that it has brought about (paradoxically) the present worldcleavage.Cancer.—The potency of this sign is expressed for us by Christ in the oftmisinterpreted words: “Other sheep I have which are not of this fold, them alsoI must bring.” This refers to the mass consciousness in contradistinction to theinitiate consciousness of His disciples. Cancer is a mass sign.Libra.—Christ stood at the point of balance in human evolution; He stood betweenthe old world and the new, between the East and the West. In the Christian eracomes a “point of balance” or that “crisis of equilibrium” in the human kingdom.Capricorn.—This sign marks the point of concretion and of crystallisation whichresults eventually in the death of the form. This we see happening today. In Histriumph over death and in His resurrection into life, Christ indicated the deepmystery of Capricorn.[568] A study of these few suggestions anent the life of Christ will bring tolight and livingness this whole subject of the three Crosses. It is needless forme to remind you at this point that on Mount Golgotha, these three Crosses areportrayed:1. The Mutable Cross—the unrepentant thief. Humanity.2. The Fixed Cross—the repentant thief. Hierarchy.3. The Cardinal Cross—the Cross of Christ. Shamballa.2. THE CROSS OF THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST.For those who read this treatise, the Cross which is of prime importance is theFixed Cross of the Heavens. Aspirants to the Mysteries are steadily increasingin numbers at this time and this involves their re-orientation towards theLight, their conscious reversal upon the wheel of the zodiac, and theircomprehension of the objectives of the processes to which they have giventhemselves upon the Fixed Cross. Disciples are apt to think that the fact oftheir taking their place upon that Cross and demonstrating their willingness tobe tested and to show unalterable stability is the major factor involved. Thisis by no means so in reality. Each of these Crosses makes its presence felt as afourfold sphere of influence or a potent centre of energy through the medium ofan “invoking sound.” This sound goes up from each of the Crosses and produces aresult and a response from some source. It is this new fact anent the Crosseswhich is of importance and upon which I seek briefly to touch. Only when theinfluence of all the four arms of each Cross has produced an effect in thesubject is a transition in consciousness made from one Cross to another—eachtransition marking a point of crisis, both in [569] the individual and in thelarger whole. Then a process of invocation is instituted—at first unconsciously,in which case it is in the nature of a diffused call, and, later, consciously,when it takes the form of a focussed appeal.When the time of transition from the Mutable Cross on to the Fixed Crossarrives, three things occur:1. The influence of the four energies of the Mutable Cross have brought about avast experience of life in form.2. There is now a gradually growing and profound dissatisfaction awakening inthe consciousness of the man making the transition. He has exhausted materialdesire to a very great extent and is no longer attracted by the Path of outgoinginto matter; the needs of the physical nature no longer dominate him; he isafraid of the impulses, emanating from the astral plane; he is awake and activementally and as a functioning personality. But he remains unsatisfied and isuncomfortably aware of it.3. He turns to invocation. This process of invocation falls into two stages:a. The stage of aspiration, irregular and vague but gradually assuming power.b. The stage of mysticism, merging into occultism (the study of that which ishidden). Duality is now consciously and uncomfortably recognised and the higherway and the spiritual vision is contacted. Desire gives place to the vaguepromptings of what might be called love. This is the movement in the personalityof that divine emerging aspect. It is this that he seeks to invoke. When this isadequately strong then true evocation [570] takes place and the disciple (forsuch the man now is) mounts the Fixed Cross.The above is true of the individual disciple and also today of humanity as awhole, and—as I have oft told you—it is this process of invocation which istaking place in the human family. This produces the present dire crisis. The twostages above outlined are present today in a general and potent sense inmankind.It was the recognition of these two stages in humanity which led me, underinstruction from the Hierarchy, to give out—at widely separated points intime—two stanzas of a great occult mantram. The first stanza, used in 1936,referred to the vague general aspiration of the mass of the people in the world,which is today more pronounced than ever before and becoming more focussedtowards true well-being.THE GREAT INVOCATIONLet the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind.Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.So let it be, and help us to do our part.The use of this first stanza was immediately successful and met with a fullresponse from those good and well-meaning people whose focus is predominantlyastral and aspirational, and whose aim is peace and quiet. This peace and quietprovides the “area of consciousness” in which aspiration can flourish, physicaland emotional comfort can be attained and the recognition of the mystical visionbecomes possible.[571] The second stanza was given out later and was intended to be a test and a“decision point in a time of crisis.”Let the Lords of Liberation issue forth. Let Them bring succour to the sons ofmen. Let the Rider from the Secret Place come forth, And coming, save. Comeforth, O Mighty One. Let the souls of men awaken to the Light, And may theystand with massed intent. Let the fiat of the Lord go forth: The end of woe hascome! Come forth, O Mighty One. The hour of service of the saving force has nowarrived. Let it be spread abroad, O Mighty One. Let Light and Love and Power andDeath Fulfil the purpose of the Coming One. The WILL to save is here. The LOVEto carry forth the work is widely spread abroad. The ACTIVE AID of all who knowthe truth is also here. Come forth, O mighty One, and blend these three.Construct a great defending wall. The rule of evil NOW must end.It was offered, under this test, to the masses, but was intended primarily forthe use of those aspirants and disciples who are not only mystics but who havemade at least some small progress in their attempt to tread the occult way. Theyare mentally focussed in their attitude; the higher way is recognised by them;the vision has been seen and they are now ready for something closer and morereal. The last stanza given is primarily, therefore, for the use of those whohave mounted, or are in process of mounting, the Fixed Cross.It is for this reason that the use of the second part of [572] the GreatInvocation was relatively limited. It was repudiated (almost violentlysometimes) by the emotional type of person who could see no further than thebeauty of peace—the goal of expression upon the astral plane. Their vision ofthe greater whole and of the evocation of the will -to-good (which is not thewill -to-peace) was exceedingly limited and this through no fault of their own.It simply indicated their place upon the ladder of evolution and marked arelatively useful point of service, but one which is in process of beingtranscended. The people in the world today are coming to realise (throughsuffering and its consequent reflection) that there is something greater thanpeace and that is the good of the whole , and not just individual, peacefulconditions or national peace. This re-orientation of the human consciousness isbrought about by the determined attitude of the souls of men, massed andblended, organised and focussed by the vision of the general welfare ofhumanity.It was, however, essential that these distinctions in attitude should appear intheir clarity and, therefore, we gave out the two stanzas of the GreatInvocation separately and at different times. You learnt thereby the differenceof attitude between the mass of well-meaning people in the world, and thecorrectly oriented attitudes of the intelligent aspirants and disciples. Thiswas necessary before wider action could later take place. I would pause here andremind you that both groups are necessary: the first group—emotional andidealistic—have a part to play in focussing the mass fluid aspiration. Theirresponsibility is to the general public. The other group of trained thinkers andpeople who are animated primarily by the will -to-good (which is of moreimportance in this world cycle than the will -to-peace) have a function to carryout in evoking hierarchical response in [573] reply to the aspiration of thefirst group. They focus this aspiration on the mental plane, create athoughtform embodying the objective and project the “call” which may reach theears of the Lords of Liberation.The blended invocation and the united call from the different levels of thehuman consciousness will bring a mighty appeal to bear upon the hidden Centresof the “Saving Force.” It is this united appeal which you must now organise.Thus the mass of humanity will be stimulated to move off the Mutable Cross on tothe Fixed Cross and the new world cycle, beginning in Aquarius (one arm of theFixed Cross) will be definitely inaugurated by humanity itself.It might be said, therefore, that the Great Invocation as first given out wasfor the use of those who are crucified upon the Mutable Cross, the Cross ofchange, whilst the second invocation is for the use of those who are crucifiedupon the Fixed Cross, the Cross of right orientation. It is for the use of thosemen and women whose aim is the will -to-good, who think in terms of worldservice and who are oriented towards light—the light of knowledge, the light ofwisdom and understanding and the light of life itself.Upon the Fixed Cross, the united influence of its four streams of energy, whenexpressing themselves fully through an individual disciple and through theHierarchy, produces likewise three emerging conditions:1. There is a vast experience of group life, group activity and group awareness.The self-conscious man in Leo becomes the group conscious man in Aquarius.2. There arises in the consciousness of the disciple a vision of the “endlessWay of which Nirvana is but the beginning.” [574]3. He recognises his task of mediatorship which is the major task of theHierarchy, mediating between Shamballa and Humanity. He knows that he must carryforward the dual task of invocation and evocation simultaneously—the evocation(through right invocation) of the will-to-good of the world thinkers andaspirants, and also the will-to-save of the Shamballa Lords, via the Hierarchy,which he is in a position directly to approach. I touch here on grave mysteries.There awakens in him, therefore, a vague determination at first which givesplace in time to an evocation of the will in himself. This eventually puts himen rapport with the will aspect of Deity as it emanates and is stepped down fromShamballa, via the Hierarchy, into which spiritual organisation he is beinggradually integrated through experience upon the Fixed Cross. It might here bepointed out that:a. Experience upon the Mutable Cross integrates a man into the centre which wecall Humanity.b. Experience upon the Fixed Cross integrates the disciple into the secondplanetary Centre which we call the Hierarchy.c. Experience upon the Cardinal Cross integrates the initiate into the primaryplanetary Centre to which we give the name Shamballa.He eventually becomes a radiating centre of spiritual will, affecting humanityand evoking its will-to-good; he blends this into the Hierarchy as far as hecan, fusing this human will into hierarchical activity in an effort to evokeresponse from Shamballa. [575]3. THE CROSS OF THE RISEN CHRIST.More upon this subject I may not give to you, nor will it profit for me toenlarge upon the conditions which emerge in the consciousness of the initiateupon the Cardinal Cross. My words would be meaningless. Most of you are in thetransition state wherein you are stabilising your individual will, and areattempting increasingly to express it in the will-to-good. I would have youdeeply realise that if the will-to-peace is conditioning you, then you are stillworking on emotional levels and your work will then have to be with the firststanza of the Great Invocation and with its distribution to the masses. If it isthe will-to-good which influences and directs you, then to the awakening of massaspiration you must add the task of evoking the response to world need in thethinkers and aspirants through the medium of the second stanza, blending the twoapproaches in an effort to evoke—via the Hierarchy—the will-to-save ofShamballa."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII - THE RAYS, CONSTELLATIONS AND PLANETS(As per Tabulation X)[579] We come now to our last discussion upon the zodiac and its relation to theseven rays. We have been occupied with the signs and their effects, and with thenew and deeply esoteric astrology which will gradually supersede the presentmundane astrology. By the end of this century, it will have won its rightfulplace in human thought. One thing you must constantly bear in mind. Now that thewar is over, and that time of acute trial and tribulation has come to an end, agreat spiritual awakening (of a quality and a nature quite unpredictable today)will arrive. The war will have taught humanity many lessons and have torn theveil of self away from many eyes. Values which have been hitherto expressed andunderstood only by those whose “eyes are on God” will be the goal and the desireof untold thousands; true understanding between men and between nations will bea longed for objective. What humanity determines to have, it ever succeeds inachieving. This is an occult law, for desire is as yet the strongest force inthe world; organised , unified desire was the basic reason for the appallingearly successes of the Axis. The only factor which can successfully opposedesire is Will, using the word in its spiritual connotation and as an expressionof the first great divine aspect. There was little of that organised, spiritualwill shown by the [580] allies; they were animated naturally by desire forvictory, desire for the arrival of the end of this all-engulfing worldcataclysm, by desire for peace and the return of stability, the desire to endwar once and for all and to break its constantly recurring cycle, and a steadilymounting desire to bring to a finish the terrible toll of suffering, of cruelty,of death, of starvation and of fear which is gripping humanity by the throat inthe attempt to strangle out its life.1. THE NATURE OF THE WILL––UNDERLYING COSMIC PURPOSE.But all this determination is in most cases simply the expression of a fixed andunited desire. It is not the organised use of the will. The secret of the willlies in the recognition of the divine nature of man. Only this can evoke thetrue expression of the will. It has in fact to be evoked by the soul, as itdominates the human mind and controls the personality. The secret of the will isalso closely tied in with the recognition of the unconquerable nature ofgoodness and the inevitability of the ultimate triumph of good. This is notdetermination; it is not whipping up and stimulating desire so that it can betransmuted into will; it is not an implacable, unshakable, immovable focussingof all energies in the need to triumph (the enemies of the Forces of Light areadept at that). Victory for the allies did lie in the effort to produce thisfocussing with better effect than the enemy. The use of the will is notexpressed by an iron fixation to stand steady and not yield to evil forces.Determination, the focussing of energy and the demonstration of an all-outeffort towards victory were only (where the allies are concerned) the expressionof a one-pointed desire for peace and for an ending of [581] the trouble. Thistype of effort is something which the masses can give and which they did give onboth sides in this conflict.There is, however, a plus, a something else, which swung the tide of victory onto the side of the Allies. It came through an unrealized effort to understandand express the quality of spiritual Will; it was the manifestation of thatdivine energy which made the first divine aspect of will or power what it is; itis that which is the distinctive feature of the Shamballa force; it is thatpeculiar and distinctive quality of divinity which is so different that evenChrist Himself was unable to express it with facility and understanding. Hencewe have the episode in Gethsemane. It is not easy for me to express itssignificance in words. Two thousand years have gone since Gethsemane and sinceChrist made His initial contact with the Shamballa force and by this means, andon behalf of humanity, established a relationship which even at the close oftwenty centuries is but a thin frail line of connecting energy.This Shamballa force is nevertheless available for right usage but the power toexpress it lies in its understanding (as far as may be possible at this midwaypoint in human evolution) and its group use. It is a unifying, synthetic force,but can be used as a regimenting, standardising force. May I repeat those twokey words to the use of the Shamballa energy: Group Use and Understanding.Mankind has had much difficulty in comprehending the significance of Love. Ifthat is so, their problem in relation to the Will will naturally be still moredifficult. For the vast majority of men, true love is still only a theory. Love(as we usually interpret it) works out as kindness but it is kindness to theform side of life, to the personalities of those around us, and fulfils itselfusually in a desire to carry [582] out our obligations and not to obstruct inany way those activities and relationships which tend to the well-being of ourfellowmen. It expresses itself in a desire to end abuses and to bring abouthappier, material, world conditions; it shows itself in mother love, in loveamong friends, but seldom as yet as love among groups and nations. It is thetheme of the Christian teaching, just as Will, divinely expressed, will be thetheme of the coming world religion and has been the impulse lying behind much ofthe good work done in the fields of philanthropy and human welfare, but,factually, love has never yet been expressed—except by the Christ.You might ask, why, if this is so, do you emphasise this highest divine aspect?Why not wait until we know more about love and how to manifest it in ourenvironment? Because, in its true expression, the Will today is needed as apropelling, expulsive force, and also as a clarifying, purifying agent.The first recorded utterance of the Christ was spoken to His mother (the symbolof the substance aspect of divinity) when He said: “Wist ye not that I must beabout My Father’s business?” That business, related by Him to the first divineaspect, the Monad or Father aspect, was the fulfilment of purpose and thecarrying out of the intention, the will and the purpose of God. His secondutterance came at the time of the Baptism in Jordan when He said to John, theBaptist: “Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil allrighteousness.” Here, in this second initiation—which symbolises the conquest ofdesire—He passes on into the realm of fulfilment, of the completion of plannedrighteous activity. For His Own personal desire (necessarily of the very highestorder on account of His high point in evolution) He substitutes the divine Will.Again at [583] the close of His life, in the Gethsemane experience, He criesout: “Father, not my will but Thine be done.” Even then and even for Him, theachievement of the full expression of will seemed well-nigh impossible; He wasconscious still of the inherent dualism of His position and of the contrastbetween His will and God’s will. In these three utterances, He demonstrates Hisrecognition of the three emerging aspects of the Shamballa life, quality andenergy:1. The Will which conditions the life aspect.2. The Will which brings fulfilment of right human relations.3. The Will which finally conquers death.These three aspects are all related to the three divine expressions of spirit,soul and body, of life, consciousness and form, of life, quality and appearance.This phase of Christ’s life expression has never been properly studied, yet evena little grasp and understanding of it would aid humanity to drive evil(individual, group and planetary) back to the place from whence it came andwould aid in the release of humanity from the terror which is today stalkingabroad, defying God and man.The Shamballa energy is, therefore, that which is related to the livingness(through consciousness and form) of humanity; we need not consider its relationto the rest of the manifested world; it concerns the establishing of right humanrelations and is that condition of being which eventually negates the power ofdeath. It is, therefore, incentive and not impulse; it is realised purpose andnot the expression of desire. Desire works from and through the material formupwards ; Will works downwards into form, bending form consciously to divinepurpose. The one [584] is invocative and the other is evocative. Desire, whenmassed and focussed, can invoke will; will, when evoked, ends desire and becomesan immanent, propulsive, driving force, stabilising, clarifying, and—among otherthings—finally destroying. It is much more than this, but this is all that mancan grasp at this time and all for which he has, as yet, the mechanism ofcomprehension. It is this will—aroused by invocation—which must be focussed inthe light of the soul, and dedicated to the purposes of light and for thepurpose of establishing right human relations which must be used (in love) todestroy all that is hindering the free flow of human life and that is bringingdeath (spiritual and real) to humanity. This Will must be invoked and evoked.I am not referring here to the use of either of the two Great Invocations or tothe third which has lately been given. I refer to the focussed consciousness ofthe men and women of goodwill, whose lives are conditioned by the will to carryforward the purposes of God in love, who seek selflessly to understand thosepurposes, and who are fearless of death.There are two great handicaps to the free expression of the Shamballa force inits true nature. One is the sensitivity of the lower nature to its impact andits consequent prostitution to selfish ends, as in the case of the sensitive,negative German people and its use by the Axis nations for material objectives.The second is the blocking, hindering, muddled but massed opposition of thewell-meaning people of the world who talk vaguely and beautifully about love,but refuse to consider the techniques of the will of God in operation .According to them, that will is something with which they personally have naughtto do; they refuse to recognise that God works out His will through men, just[585] as He is ever seeking to express His love through men; they will notbelieve that that will could possibly express itself through the destruction ofevil with all the material consequences of that evil. They cannot believe that aGod of Love could possibly employ the first divine aspect to destroy the formswhich are obstructing the free play of the divine spirit; that will must notinfringe upon their interpretation of love. Such people are individually ofsmall moment and of no importance but their massed negativity was a realdetriment to the ending of this war, just as the massed negativity of the Germanpeople and their inability to take right action when Hitler’s purposes weredisclosed made possible the great inflow of ancient and focussed evil which hasbrought the present catastrophe to man. Such people are like a millstone aroundthe neck of humanity, crippling true effort, murmuring “Let us love God and eachother,” but doing nothing but murmuring prayers and platitudes whilst humanityis dying.You can easily appreciate the fact that the evocation of the energy of the willand its effect upon the unprepared, materialistically minded person might andwould prove a disaster. It would simply serve to focus and strengthen the lowerself-will, which is the name we give to realised and determined desire. It couldthen create such a driving force, directed to selfish ends, that the personmight become a monster of wickedness. In the history of the race, one or twoadvanced personalities have done this with dire results both to themselves andto the people of their time. One such figure in ancient times was Nero; themodern example is Hitler. What, however, has made the latter so dangerous anenemy of the human family is that during the last two thousand years mankind hasadvanced to a point where it can also be responsive to certain aspects of thisfirst ray [586] force. Hitler, therefore, found associates and co-operators whoadded their receptivity to his so that an entire group became the responsiveagents of the destructive energy, expressing itself in its lowest aspect. Thisis what enabled them to work ruthlessly, powerfully, selfishly, cruelly andsuccessfully at the destruction of all that attempted to impede their projectsand desires.There is only one way in which focussed evil will, with its responsiveness tothe Shamballa force, can be overcome and that is by the opposition of an equallyfocussed spiritual will, displayed by responsive men and women of goodwill whocan train themselves to be sensitive to this type of new incoming energy and canlearn how to invoke and evoke it.You can consequently see why there was more than the casual use of a currentword in my mind when the terms of goodwill and of the will-to-good werediscussed. All the time, I had in my thoughts not just kindness and goodintention, but the focussed will-to-good which can and must evoke the Shamballaenergy and use it for the arresting of the forces of evil.This, I realise, is a relatively new idea to many of you; to others of you itwill mean little or nothing; others again may have faint glimmerings of this newapproach to God and service which—again I say—can and must remake, rebuild, andrehabilitate the world. I would like here to point out that the will aspect canbe contacted only from the mental plane and only those, therefore, who areworking with and through the mind can begin to appropriate this energy. Thosewho seek to evoke the Shamballa force are approaching close to the energy offire. Fire is the symbol and the quality of the mental plane. Fire is an aspectof the divine nature. Fire was an outstanding aspect [587] of the war. Fire isproduced by physical means and the aid of the mineral kingdom and this was thegreat menacing and chosen means of destruction in this war. This is a fulfilmentof the ancient prophecy that the attempt to destroy the Aryan race will be bymeans of fire, just as ancient Atlantis was destroyed by water. But, fierygoodwill and the conscious focussed use of the Shamballa force can counter fireby fire and this must be done .I cannot give you more upon this subject until you have given time to itsconsideration and have sought to understand the use of the will, its nature,purpose and its relation to what you understand by the human will. You mustponder upon how it should be employed and in what manner aspirants and discipleswho are mentally polarised can focus that will and safely shoulder theresponsibility for its wise use. Later when you know more about it, I can giveyou further knowledge upon the matter. I would however like to make onepractical suggestion. Might there not be organised a group who would take thissubject as the theme of their meditation and who would try to fit themselves—byright understanding —to contact and use the Shamballa energy? Would it not bepossible gradually to elaborate this theme of the revelation of the divine willso that the general subject may be ready for presentation to the thinking publicwhen peace truly comes? There is much to be considered in this connection. Thereis the demonstration of the three aspects of the will as enumerated above; thereis the preparation of the individual for the expression of this energy; there isa mature consideration to be given to the relation of the Hierarchy toShamballa, carried forward as the Masters attempt to work out divine purpose andto be the distributing Agents of the will energy. There is the effort to be madeto comprehend somewhat the nature of [588] the direct impact of the first aspectupon the human consciousness, apart from the hierarchical centre altogether—animpact made without any of the absorbing and stepping-down process to which theHierarchy subjects it. I have referred to this direct contact elsewhere; it canbe more direct and complete when there is greater safety brought about by a moreunderstanding human approach.One of the causes lying behind World War II is to be found in a prematurecontact—a contact made by certain selfish minds of a relatively high quality,aided by the Black Lodge. To offset this and eventually bring about theelimination of the influence of the dark forces from our planet must come theactive, conscious use of the Shamballa force by the White Lodge, aided by themen and women whose will-to-good is strong enough to safeguard them frompersonal peril in their work and from being deflected on to wrong and dangerouslines. This aid necessitates a certain definite and planned contact andinterplay between the two centres: Humanity and Hierarchy. When this is betterestablished, there can be organised and known cooperation and the members ofboth great centres can “stand together with massed intent.” This massed intentwill be the correspondence upon the mental plane of the massed intent of thegeneral public who stand with the power of appeal upon their lips and in theirhearts. To this appeal must be added the focussed will of the world thinkers andintuitives who will use their minds and brains in the affirmation of right.It was for the reason that the will aspect was involved that I made our lastpoint in our consideration of the seven rays to be a consideration of the Rays,Constellations and Planets, as given in Tabulation X. The inter-relation theregiven concerns the first aspect of the will, as I have [589] here indicated. Theanalysis of this tabulation will complete our consideration of esotericastrology.The seven stars of the Great Bear are the originating sources of the seven raysof our solar system. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear express Themselvesthrough the medium of the seven planetary Logoi Who are Their Representativesand to whom they stand in the relation of Prototype. These seven planetarySpirits manifest through the medium of the seven sacred planets.Each of these seven rays, coming from the Great Bear, are transmitted into oursolar system through the medium of three constellations and their rulingplanets. The following tabulation will make this clear, but must be interpretedonly in terms of the present turn of the great zodiacal wheel of 25,000 years.2. VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE WILLWe have now the difficult task of considering an aspect of divine manifestationwhich is as yet so little apparent upon the physical plane that we lack theexact word with which to express it and those words available are likewisemisleading. I can, however, attempt to give you certain concepts, relationshipsand parallels which may serve to close this section on astrology and lay afoundation for future teaching around the year 2025. That is the mode wherebyall revelation comes. A thought is given; a symbol described; an idea portrayed.Then, as the minds of men ponder upon it and the intuitives of the world pick upthe thought, it serves as a seed thought which eventually comes to fruition withthe presentation and the unfolding of a revelation which serves to lead the raceof men nearer to their goal.

SaturnWe are considering the expression of the Shamballa force in terms of Will, i.e.,of divine purpose, latent in the mind of God since the beginning of time and thedawn of creation. In God’s mind, that idea is seen whole and complete. Inmanifestation it is a gradual, self-revealing evolutionary and demonstratedactivity. We know somewhat of the intelligence aspect of God. It is revealed inthe living activity of substance. Of the love of that Great Thinker, we arelearning slowly and its revelation has reached the stage where the human mindcan contrast its [591] mode of living activity with the visioned and sensed loveof Deity, expressed as yet by the desire for right human relations and righttreatment of all that is non-human. Of the will and purpose of God, humanityknows nothing, for the individual will or the collective human will which couldact as interpreter, revealer and also serve as a mode of contact, is dedicatedto selfishness and blind to the higher reaches of divine expression. Mankind’sso-called acquiescence in the will of God is based on his wish life, on hisnegativity and on the visions of the saints. Their keynote was submission andtheir highest point of spiritual contact was still tinged with dualism and stillconditioned by modes of human interpretation.Under the occult method, we must begin with the universal and the whole; in timethe individual and the particular will stand revealed, but in relation to thewhole. It should be possible, through a study of the seven rays and theirrelated constellations and their transmitting agents, the planets, to gain somegeneral idea of the pouring through of the Shamballa energy as emerging purposeon the physical plane.I have earlier referred to three major expressions of the will aspect. There iswill, as the conditioner of the life aspect. This refers not to events,happenings and occurrence, but to the nature of the life manifestations in anycycle, through any nation or race, where humanity is concerned. This refers alsoto the broad and general lines which at any time upon the planet are setting thepace for the evolution of forms and which basically concerns the force andendurance of the life as it manifests through and creates those externalconditions which are qualified and expressed in terms of life, of quality andappearance. The word “life” in this triplicity of terms refers to life as [592]humanity understands it. The word “life” to which I here refer is the life towhich H.P.B. refers as that which synthesises spirit, soul and body. (See TheSecret Doctrine , I. 81). It is in reality that fourth something which hoversbehind all manifestation and behind all objects, all qualified expressions ofdivinity and which is hinted at in the Bhagavad Gita in the words: “Havingpervaded this whole universe with a fragment of Myself, I remain.”There is next the will which brings fulfilment . This is the basis of allrelationships and all processes of inter-relation in our solar system and (asfar as humanity is concerned) in the planet. It is the prime factor in bringingabout the inevitability of the divine consummation; it is the cause of allfruition of all forms on all planes and of divine intention; it is that whichlies back of consciousness itself. I know not how else to express this in wordsand having done so they prove wholly inadequate. There is a faint, dim,uncertain reflection of this will-fulfilment in the joy of achievement asregistered by a human being who finds his heart’s desire. Long processes ofevolution precede this fulfilment and long experience of the living activity ofthe will of God as Life. This concentrated evolutionary effort, this undeviatingpurpose has called forth more than desire and more than the will-to-be-active.There is a realised achievement from the very start for this is the divinewill-to-completion which precedes the creative effort. It is the synthesis ofcreation, or persistent endeavour, adherence to vision and complete sacrifice,and all of these in terms of divine experienced experiment , if I might soformulate the idea. Remember, therefore, that all through these experiences ofthe divine will runs the thread of a fulfilled synthesis. This is more thancohesion in time and space; it is more [593] than the principle of privationabout which H.P.B. speaks, and more than self-imposed limitation. It is the endseen from the beginning; it is alpha and omega producing the completed whole andthe perfect fruition of the divine will.It is, finally, the will which conquers death . This again must not beinterpreted in terms of death as it affects the form nature of manifestation.The note of synthesis and triumph—realised and complete—persists behind all thatwe can recognise as death. This will is the principle of victory, of theultimate goal of life when fruition is achieved; it is the final united successor unified conformity to a long foreseen purpose of spirit-matter, life-form,plus that something which is the dream and goal of the highest initiates in theHierarchy to contact—the secret revelation of Shamballa itself. More it is notpossible to say. If Christ Himself is striving towards that knowledge, it is notpossible for us to do more than speculate.In these few words, I have sought to convey an idea of a vast subjectiverealisation. What I am hinting at in reality is the objective of that “endlessWay of which Nirvana itself is but the open door”—the Way to the higherevolution for which our evolutionary process prepares mankind. I am indicatingwhat is the goal of all hierarchical endeavour. Mankind is so preoccupied withthe attitude and effort of the Hierarchy as regards human welfare and guidancethat the goal of the efforts of the Masters of the Wisdom is naturallyoverlooked. It is in reality no concern of man. Nevertheless, the picture of thedivine Plan so oft emphasised in occult books and by occult teachers isdistorted unless it is realised that just as humanity strives towards theHierarchy, so that Hierarchy itself strives towards Shamballa. As the OldCommentary has it:[594] “He who sees in the dark light of Shamballa penetrates to that which liesbeyond our little sphere to that which can be sensed behind the holy triangle(Venus, Mercury, the Earth, A.A.B.). There is to be found the point of radiantfire which shines within the eye (Taurus), which burns upon the mountain-top(Capricorn) and which the water cannot quench (Aquarius). These are the holiestthree.”As we consider the seven rays as outlined in Tabulation X, I would have you bearin mind that we are viewing them as expressions of this threefold will. We havestudied them in some detail in my other books from the angle of consciousnessand from the point of view as producing changes and expansions of consciousnessin man, in nations and in races. Now, as far as may be possible, we are going toconsider these rays as they express the pure, living activity of Deity as itfulfils Itself in manifestation as pure incentive, directed impersonal energy,divine instinct which latter is a blend of instinctual force and intuitiveenergy. It might be pointed out to those of you who have some measure of occultperception that this synthetic Life, being cosmic, emerges from cosmic planesand not systemic. Hence the difficulty in comprehending it.1. The conditioning will is the synthesis of the life of the cosmic physicalplane of which our seven planes are the seven subplanes. Until, therefore, thehuman consciousness is far more expanded than it is, it is not possible for manto understand this synthetic realisation.2. The will which brings fulfilment is the divine incentive [595] (impulse isnot the correct term) coming from the cosmic astral plane.3. The will which conquers death is an outpouring from the cosmic mental plane.From these three cosmic planes (embracing the sacred personality of the Logoi,solar and planetary) come the united energies of the three constellations whichcontrol and energise our solar system: The Great Bear, the Pleiades and Sirius;these work through the medium of the seven rays and these in turn expressthemselves through the twelve constellations which form the great zodiacalwheel. The Lords or ruling Powers of these twelve sources of light and life“step down” the potency of these three major energies so that our solar Logoscan absorb them; they “tune out” those aspects of these three Potencies whichare not suited to our systemic life at this point in the evolutionary process,just as the Hierarchy upon our little planet tunes out or steps down theenergies from Shamballa. These three major energies in a mysterious mannerexpress themselves through the seven rays just as all triplicities subdivideinto septenates, yet preserve their identity. These seven energies, emanatingfrom the major three and transmitted via the twelve constellations, are embodiedin the seven sacred planets and are represented on our Earth by the sevenSpirits before the throne of God (the symbol of synthesis). This tremendousinter-relation is embodied in one great process of: Transmission. Reception.Absorption. Relation and Living Activity. The method is one of Invocation andEvocation . In these two sentences, you have one of the most important clues tothe whole evolutionary process; the key to the mystery of time and space, andthe solution of [596] all problems. But the factor which is of major importanceis that the whole matter is an expression of focussed Will.In considering this process, I would have you study Tabulation X, for it is asymbolic form, embodying what I seek to convey. I would point out that the willaspect—as it is embodied in the rays and transmitted by the constellations—worksout destructively when concentrated through an orthodox planet andconstructively when concentrated through an esoteric planet. Here you have thesecret guide to the significance of death and immortality. This is somethingwhich the average astrologer will be unable to prove because the cycles involvedare too long; intuitively he can however grasp the probability of myproposition. May I again remind you that our theme is the divine plan, purposeand will; it is not the evolution of consciousness, or of the second aspect ofdivinity. It concerns spirit and not soul. We are attempting in some measure toformulate the life of the Father, the will of the Monad and the purpose ofSpirit. In all these (the three aspects of the will) lies germinating the seedof the next solar system, the third, and the fruition of the PersonalityManifestation of the Logos. We need, therefore, to formulate the interpretationof the seven rays in terms of will and not of love or consciousness. This wewill now attempt to do.RAY I.—The energy of Will or Power. This ray is outstandingly related to thataspect of will which conquers death. It is nevertheless the Ray of theDestroyer. In this connection, I would remind you that the human attitude thatdeath is the destroyer presents a limited and erroneous point of view. The firstray destroys death because in reality there is no such thing; the concept is allpart of the Great Illusion, is a limitation of [597] the human consciousness,and is basically connected with the brain and not with the heart, strange asthat may seem to you. It is in a very true sense “a figment of the imagination.”Ponder on this. The abolition of death and of the destruction of form is amanifestation of Ray I, for it brings about in reality the death of negation andthe inauguration of true activity. It is the energy which can be called “divineincentive”; it is the life in the seed which destroys successively all forms inorder that realised fruition may eventuate. That is the clue to Ray I. It is theWill which initiates .Today, as regards humanity, its highest realisation is initiation.RAY II.—The energy of Love-Wisdom. This basic energy is the will to unify, tosynthesise, to produce coherence and mutual attraction and to establishrelationships, but—remember this—relationships which are entirely apart from theconsciousness of relation or the realisation of unity. It is the fact ofunification as seen from the beginning and as existing ever and forever in theMind of God Whose will embraces past, present and future and Whose mind does notthink in terms of evolution or of process. The process is inherent in the seed;the evolutionary urge is the inevitable accompaniment of life in manifestation.It is the Will to unification.Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is the mystical vision.RAY III.—The energy of Active Intelligence. This is the will of conditionedpurpose. The factors which are working out through its medium are the forcefulcarrying forward of the recognised plan with a goal intelligently [598]conceived and an active incentive which carries the process intelligentlyforward on the strength of its own momentum. Again I would remind you that I amdealing not with human consciousness but with the sum total of that undertakingwhich makes matter subservient to and adaptable to the basic idea in the mind ofGod. And no human being is as yet able to conceive of that idea. No one knowswhat is the will of God or what is the nature of His intelligent purpose. It isthe Will to evolution.Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is education, or progressivedevelopment through experience.RAY IV.—The energy of Harmony through Conflict. This is fundamentally the willto destroy limitation. This is not the same thing as the will to destroynegation as in the case of Ray I, but is an allied aspect of that. I am notreferring to the consciousness aspect which recognises and profits by suchstruggle. I am referring to the energy, inherent in all forms and peculiarlystrong in humanity (because man is self-conscious), which produces inevitablyand unavoidably the struggle between life and that which it has chosen as alimitation; this eventually shatters or breaks up that limitation the momentthat a point of real harmony or at-one-ment has been reached. Esoterically itmight be said that the moment that form (limitation) and life balance each othera rift immediately appears and through it flows a fresh outpouring of the will.Christ had to die because He had achieved harmony with the will of God and then“the veil of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.” Thesignificance of this fresh [599] inflow of the Will will now appear; the stageis set anew for a fresh and renewed activity of the living principle. As far ashumanity is concerned the “seeds of death” emerge through the medium of this Rayand the Grim Reaper, Death, is but an aspect of this will, conditioned by thefourth ray and emerging from the fourth plane. Death is an act of the intuition,transmitted by the soul to the personality and then acted upon in conformity tothe divine will by the individual will. This is the Will to harmonisation .Today, its highest expression as regards humanity is the intuition, as it worksout through group activity. Death always releases the individual into the group.RAY V.—The energy of Concrete Science or Knowledge. To understand thisexpression of the divine will, the student should bear in mind the occultaphorism that “matter is spirit at its lowest point of manifestation and spiritis matter at its highest.” Basically this is the will which produces concretionand yet at the same time constitutes the point at which spirit and matter arebalanced and co-equal. That is the reason why human perfection is carriedforward consciously upon the mental plane, the fifth plane; this is broughtabout by the fifth ray and upon this plane liberation takes place at the time ofthe fifth initiation. This is the will which is inherent in substance and whichactuates all atoms of which all forms are made. It is closely related to thefirst solar system even whilst liberating members of the human family who willconstitute the nucleus around which the third solar system is constructed. Theenergy of this ray is intelligence; it is the seed of consciousness but not ofconsciousness as we understand it; it is the inherent [600] life of matter andthe will to work intelligently; it is that living something for which we have noname which was the product of the first solar system. It is one of the majorassets of God, the Father and also of the human Monad. This is the Will toAction.Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is liberation—through deathor initiation.RAY VI.—The energy of Devotion or of Idealism. This is the will which embodiesGod’s idea. It provides the motive power behind the working out of whatever maybe the purpose of creation. What that purpose is we have not as yet the faintestidea. An ideal is related to the consciousness aspect as far as human beings areconcerned. An idea is related to the will aspect. This ray embodies a dominantpotency. It expresses God’s desire and is the basic energy emanating from thecosmic astral plane. It conceals the mystery which is to be found in therelationship of the will and desire. Desire is related to consciousness. Will isnot . We are not, however, dealing with consciousness but with that impersonalforce which drives forward through all the seven planes of our solar system andwhich makes the idea of God a consummated fact in the Eternal Now. Does thatstatement mean much to you? I would surmise that it means but little; it is abasic statement of occult fact anent energy as it expresses itself throughhumanity in a manner which is unique and peculiar. I would here remind you of astatement in The Secret Doctrine that “an Idea is a Being incorporeal which hasno subsistence by itself but gives figure and form unto shapeless matter andbecomes the cause of the manifestation.” This statement takes you straight backto God [601] the Father, to the Monad, to the One. It is related, consequently,to the Will and not to consciousness. Consciousness is per se the recognition ofa progressive plan. The Will is the cause, the energising Principle, Life,Being. This is the Will to Causation .Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is idealism, the incentiveand cause of human activity.RAY VII.—This is the energy of Ceremonial Order. It is an expression of the willwhich drives through into outer manifestation; it is that which embodies boththe periphery and the point at the centre. It is the will to “ritualisticsynthesis,” if I might so word it. It is Necessity which is the primeconditioning factor of the divine nature—the necessity to express itself; thenecessity to manifest in an orderly rhythmic manner; the necessity to embrace“that which is above and that which is below” and, through the medium of thisactivity, to produce beauty, order, perfect wholes and right relationships. Itis the driving energy which Being emanates as It appears and takes form andlives. It is the Will towards Expression.Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is organisation.In the above statements anent the rays, you can see that the full circle oftheir activity is complete from the angle of God the Father; the will toinitiate manifestation and its attendant progressive expression meets the willtowards full achievement and the energy of Being itself arrives—in time andspace today (in the mind of God) at full consummation.3. THE KEYNOTES OF THE SEVEN RAYS AND THE WILL ASPECT.[602] The keynotes of these seven Rays are, therefore, as they constitute therevelation of seven Great Beings:Initiation. Unification. Evolution. Harmonisation. Action. Causation.Expression.These are the keynotes for humanity at its present point of evolutionarydevelopment; as these seven energies play upon the human consciousness in aneffort to produce and evoke the Will aspect in advanced man they produce:Initiation. Vision. Education. Intuition. Liberation. Idealism. Organisation.A close study of these seven major rays and seven minor keynotes will revealthese truths and their promise. At the close of the Aquarian Age, these keynoteswill vary somewhat because the recognition of the Will (leading to understandingcooperation) will produce major changes in human polarisation and humanobjectives—realised objectives.Let us now see how these basic ray energies will work out in man’s planetary andzodiacal relationships and why certain constellations and planets are related tocertain rays and transmit into the centre which we call humanity definite andspecific influences. These produce certain tendencies in humanity, evoke certainattitudes of the will, and lead consequently to certain unavoidable events aswell as to definite and determined forms of Being.As we proceed with our consideration of Tabulation X, there are certainfundamental ideas which must be carefully borne in mind. Let me list them foryour helping:1. We are dealing with the effect of the seven ray energies, as they pour forthfrom one or other of the seven stars of the Great Bear into our solar system.These energies [603] are the life-quality of the seven great Beings Who are thePrototypes of the planetary Logoi of the sacred planets, seven in number. Theselatter are Their reflections in time and space, as the soul is the reflector ofthe Monad where human beings are concerned.2. The seven rays express themselves, each through three of the zodiacalconstellations. The analogy (but not the correspondence) is that these threeconstellations are to the life of one of these ray Beings what the three aspectsof monad-soul-body are to a man. Again, it is only analogy. Forget not thatanalogy and correspondence are not the same. In the first case there isresemblance but not in detail. In the second, there is practically identicalexpression, usually on a lower level.3. These seven great Beings express Themselves in our solar system as thecustodians or the exponents of the Will aspect of Deity. Their effect,therefore, is ever to convey into our solar system and eventually into ourplanetary life, the energy of the Will, in its planmaking, form-building nature.Esoteric books and esoteric teaching have necessarily laid the emphasis uponconsciousness as it expresses quality. That is as it should be. But behind allquality lies That of which the quality is the expression and behind that is tobe found the dynamic “out-going” (if I might so express it) which is themotivation of both the quality or consciousness and the life or appearance, theprecipitation of will and quality.4. The nature of the will is as yet undefinable for only the Monad responds toits impact, and only after the third initiation does man somewhat grasp thenature of the will. All that is possible to understand in this brief summationis the effect of the will as it makes its presence [604] felt and the result ofits expression, emphasised through the three constellations.5. The constellations in groups of three transmit the seven influences of theseven rays to our planet, via the Sun, and the relationships which I am hereindicating are only those in connection with our Earth. They do not apply inrelation to others of the planets in our solar system, where the configurationof the relationship is different. This is dependent upon the nature of theetheric web through which all transmission of energies takes place. The lines ofapproach might be indicated as follows:DIAGRAM ONE[Image00024.jpg]An illustration of this in line with our tabulation would be:DIAGRAM TWO[Image00025.jpg][605] 6. This diamond shaped formation of the inter-related energies is theprototypal pattern which lies behind the etheric network and is its final,conditioning influence as far as our Earth is concerned. It is hinted at in thereference to the “diamond soul” of which the Buddha is an exponent. This isnecessarily a deep mystery but the correlation is interesting and guaranteeing.7. These seven ray energies, expressing the divine prototypal will in sevenforms, are as follows:Ray I.—The will to initiate.Ray II.—The will to unify.Ray III.—The will to evolve.Ray IV.—The will to harmonise or relate.Ray V.—The will to act.Ray VI.—The will to cause.Ray VII.—The will to express.When their full creative work is completed, there will emerge a “something elseor other” for which we have no name but which will be the seed of the next solarsystem. This third solar system will express the divine will, as this is slowlydeveloped through the experiment and experience of the divine love.8. These seven ray aspects of the will, which are the goal of the higherinitiations and which embody that which the Masters Themselves are struggling tounderstand, is that which flowers in the Monad when souls have reached perfectedexpression through humanity. They express themselves where humanity is concernedas:Ray I.—That which incites to and produces initiation.Ray II.—That which is the cause of vision or the power to see. [606]Ray III.—That which develops sensory perception into knowledge, knowledge intowisdom and wisdom into omniscience.Ray IV.—That which is the illumined will, the basis of buddhi or the intuition.Ray V.—That which is the cosmic seed of liberation. This is an aspect ofdestruction.Ray VI.—That which is the cause of the thoughtform building faculty, related tothe creative urge.Ray VII.—That which can be called the principle of order.9. Just as desire has produced this “son of necessity,” our solar system, therelies behind all the energies of the Heart of God and all the forces which haveproduced the manifested universe that which is the result of divine need. It isneither the cosmic correspondence of brain or mind or focussed intention, as youmight surmise. It is that synthetic something which produces cohesion andresults in fruition or synthesis as the effect or final result of manifestation.It is well-nigh impossible for me to make this any clearer because I am speakingof some of the final aspects and effects of the highest initiations. I onlytouch upon them because they consummate and climax this study of divinepsychology as it manifests through God and through man. I am simply giving faintand inadequate indications of that which emerges in the human consciousnessafter the third initiation—the point at which personality or form life istranscended and the Monad becomes the object of the desired attainment; itsspiritual pressure is then increasingly felt. It is, therefore, only possible topoint to distant goals. [607] We can, however, gain some dim, humaninterpretations of divine goals by relating these rays and their transmittingconstellations to our Earth and by noting how this triangular relationship canwork out on our planet. Individual apprehension will be dependent upon the pointof development and only the higher initiates will understand the realimplications of my remarks.You have to remember, therefore, as you study these most deeply esotericrelations that we approach them from two angles—the only angles which are as yetpossible to the finite mind of man:1. The relation of the three constellations to the rays which are eachexpressing the quality of the Life of an Informing Entity—the Being Who isexpressing Identity through one or other of the seven stars of the Great Bear,Ursa Major, as we probably ought to call this constellation.2. The three aspects of the will which the three constellations are expressingand to which human beings will consciously respond after the third initiation.These three aspects are:a. The will which conditions and initiates.b. The will which brings fulfilment.c. The will which conquers death.Before entering into a closer analysis of our subject, I would remind you thatwe are in reality dealing with universals, symbolised for us in the hugeaggregate of constellations with which our theme is concerned:1. The seven stars of the Great Bear or Ursa Major are involved in an intricaterelation with Ursa Minor and the Pleiades. With this we shall not deal. Thismajor [608] triplicity of constellations has a peculiar relation to that GreatBeing to Whom I have at times referred as the One About Whom Naught Can Be Said.All that can be hinted at is that these three galaxies of stars are the threeaspects of that Indescribable, Absolute Monad, the Ineffable Cause of the sevensolar systems—of which ours is one.2. The twelve constellations of the zodiac, each with its own inter-relations,peculiar to its own integral Life, form—each of them—part of a triangle ofenergies. Each of these triangles is a unit in itself but in conjunction withthe other triangles forms part of that major quaternary which is the cosmicanalogy of the quaternary of the One Life—soul and the dual psychic nature,called in some of the esoteric books kama-manas , plus the vital nature. Thesefour are the expression of the One Ineffable Cause.3. Our solar system (of supreme unimportance) is yet a part of the sevenfoldappearance of that same Essential Cause. As you know, from a study of The SecretDoctrine , our solar system is a tiny reflection or replica of the 1, the 3, the7, the 12. Because of that innate, inherent correspondence, it has within itselfthe capacity to respond to the energies emanating from this fountainhead oflight and will. More than this I may not say, because the entire theme is toovast for human thinking, with its limitations of consciousness and itsinadequacy of language. But even a dim perception of that vast aggregation ofintelligent Forces and this immense concatenation of stupendous, divine“Intentions” will serve to bring into clearer light, the realisation that oursolar system (and consequently our planet) is a part of this vast whole, keptalive by its “grace,” [609] fused by its will, and preserved by its “Intention.”Because these Forces are , we are; because They persist, we persist; becauseThey move in form, in space, in time, we do the same.4. COSMIC ENERGIES AND TRANSFORMATION.Let us now briefly get an idea of this stream of energies as they move outwardinto space from Ursa Major, as they are transmitted, through certain zodiacalconstellations to our solar system and thence, via the Sun to the seven sacredplanets. These produce what are called “transformations” on our non-sacredplanet, the Earth, bringing it increasingly into line with the will aspect ofdivinity. You have in reality the following explanatory diagram, which may makethe whole process somewhat clearer to you:DIAGRAM THREE[Image00026.jpg]This is the only way that I can give you an idea of the distribution ofenergies, their limitation within the bounds of the zodiac, and their focussingwithin the periphery of [610] our solar system. Let me make it more specific asregards one of the rays and its triangular relationships as given in TabulationX:DIAGRAM FOUR[Image00027.jpg]a. The Earth being itself one of the five non-sacred planets, only four arelisted as among the transfiguring agents.b. The darkened planets indicate the transmitting agents of the Forces, passedthrough the transformation process by the Sun.c. The Sun and Moon are listed among the non-sacred planets as they are, in thisinstance, blinds or veils.d. The origin of the hour glass is to be found in this diagram of the inflowingenergies.e. The above diagram can be used in connection with any of the seven rays, butwill involve:1. The use of other transmitting agents in the form of the appropriate threezodiacal constellations and their rulers. [611]2. The indicating of planets, different to those involved in the inflow of firstray energy.f. The key to the whole process as far as the Earth is concerned—and theindividual on the Earth—is to be found in the words:Transcending.—The transcending cause.Transmitting.—The zodiacal constellations.Transforming.—The Sun. The Soul.Transfiguring.—The planets.To these I might add one word in connection with the Earth and its humanitywhich is allied to all the above.DIAGRAM FIVE[Image00028.jpg]This word is Translated , for when the “souls of just men are made perfect,” aprocess of translation takes place which [612] lifts humanity off and away fromthe planet on to one or other of the seven cosmic Paths to which our seveninitiations form the entering doors.In connection with the human individual and his progress and initiation ortranslation from one state of consciousness to another, there is to be found asmall replica of the above:a. The soul of man receives from all three major planetary centres or groups.b. The darkened spots indicate awakened, alert centres.c. The diagram indicates the “interior light chart” of an advanced aspirant onthe verge of discipleship.The whole story of extension from the One into the Many and of the Many into theOne is contained in these macrocosmic and microcosmic diagrams.Let us now take each of the seven Rays and see how they embody and transmit thethree aspects of the will, via three constellations and their rulers, to ourEarth. We enter here into the realm of causes and are dealing with thosetranscendent purposes, incentives, urges and objectives of the One in Whom welive and move and have our being. This great Life, the Ancient of Days, the Lordof the world, Sanat Kumara, the Eternal Youth, the planetary Logos—His manynames are of relative unimportance—is the only Existence upon our planet Who iscapable of responding to and carrying out the objectives of the solar Logos. He,in His turn, is the only one in our solar system capable of responding to thesevenfold Emanating Cause, expressing Itself through the Great Bear or UrsaMajor. We will, however, deal with the psychological aspects of the emanationsof the seven Rays which embody the will-to-good . [613]RAY I. Will or Power: Aries, Leo . . . . . working through the medium of thefour planets: Mars, Mercury, the Sun, Saturn. Capricorn.This is the will which lies behind all initiatory activity , that is,a. The initiation of the previous stages of creation.b. The initiation of the urge to evolve, proceed, progress.c. The initiation of the differentiating process in order to produce.These are all expressions or effects of the activity of the ray energy and allcan be best summed up in the thought of a dynamic “entering into”—by an act ofthe focussed will—a new state of consciousness. This leads inevitably to a newrealisation of being. In this statement, you have one of the basic definitionsof initiation as far as the initiation of a human being is concerned. These aredim reflections of the dynamic processes to which the One Life subjects Itselfas it enters into the dualistic condition of spirit-matter. The will herereferred to lies behind the dualism and is analogous to the reception andfocussing of an initial idea as it enters into the mind of a creative, advancedhuman being, his thought processes and his achievements. Some understanding ofthis will come if the disciple will consider what fixed aspiration, a vision ofthe goal and a determination to follow the will-to-good has effected in hislife. Beyond this realisation, he cannot go, but it holds for him the cosmicseed of understanding.It is necessary to remember that on the Path of Initiation, the whole trainingprocess is turned towards the evolution of the will and this is possible becausebehind the development of love lies the revelation of the will. It is rightly[614] taught that man’s immediate goal is the unfoldment (into full expression)of the love nature. This begins to take place and reaches a relatively highstage of unfoldment upon the Path of Discipleship. The detail of the process ina broad and general sense might be stated as follows:1. Path of Evolution and Probation.a. Unfoldment of intellect and of sensory perception.b. Response to the centre called Humanity .c. The mind takes control. Personality functions.2. Path of Discipleship.a. Unfoldment of the love nature.b. Achievement of illumination.c. Response to the centre called the Hierarchy .d. Buddhi or the intuition is in control. The soul functions.3. Path of Initiation .a. Unfoldment of the will.b. Achievement of synthesis.c. Response to the centre called Shamballa .d. Dynamic Purpose in control. The will-to-good. The Monad functions.This covers familiar ground for all of you but in the effort to achieve a visionof the whole, constant repetition has its place. We are now concerned with thethird stage of the evolutionary process, carried forward upon the Path ofInitiation and entered into (as far as humanity is concerned) at the thirdinitiation, and consummated at the seventh initiation—an initiation far moreeasily reached by people upon the first Ray than on any of the others.This—as far as you can at this time grasp—concerns primarily the creative willas it: [615]1. Initiates manifestation, and conditions that which is created.2. Brings about eventual fulfilment.3. Overcomes death or differentiation.All initiates must and eventually do express dynamic, creative will, a focussedpurpose which expresses only the will-to-good and also that sustained effortwhich brings fulfilment. I would remind you here that sustained effort is theseed of synthesis, the cause of achievement and that which finally overcomesdeath . Death is really deterioration in time and space and is due to thetendency of matter-spirit to isolate itself, whilst in manifestation (from thestandpoint of consciousness). This sustained effort of the Logos is what keepsall forms in manifestation and preserves even the life aspect as the integratingfactor in form building and—which is equally an act of the sustaining will—canabstract or withdraw the life consciousness intact at the close of a cycle ofmanifestation. Death and limitation are synonymous terms. When the consciousnessis focussed in form and identified entirely with the principle of limitation, itregards freedom from form life as death; but, as evolution proceeds, theconsciousness shifts increasingly into awareness of that which is not form andinto the realm of that which is transcendent or into the world of the abstract,i.e., into that which is abstracted from form and focussed in itself. This, bythe way is a definition of meditation from the angle of goal and achievement. Aman can truly meditate when he begins to use the mind, the reflection of thewill aspect, and employs it in its three aspects: as initiating his entranceinto the world of souls, as conditioning his personality life and as enforcingand eventually bringing about a full expression of soul purpose. This results[616] in the complete overcoming of death. I am bringing this whole concept downinto terms of the microcosm even though it will be obvious that only the pledgeddisciple in preparation for initiation can begin to grasp some of thesignificant implications.Perhaps I can best sum up the keynote of the first Ray of Will or Power, as itseeks expression as dynamic purpose on Earth and in relation to the human being,by quoting or paraphrasing the Old Commentary .“The Transcendent One, the Life, the Whole, the All entered into communion withItself and by this act became a vital point of life and focussed power.I am and I am not. Greater than This is That; smaller than That is This. ButThat must show to This the nature of the whole, and showing prove itself untoItself.I, the beginning am. I am the outward and the inward Way and back into the pointof concentration and from the point I turn again unto Myself, carrying within myheart of love that which I, the One, have served and that for which I sacrificeMyself.”In the process of sacrifice, that which is the sustaining Whole, the inner coreof all life and the principle of integration, realises within Itself thefollowing stages in consciousness:1. It knows Itself as the transcending will , the will which sees the entireprocess from the point of initiation, but which limits itself to the gradualexpression of that will on account of the limitations of those aspects of Itself[617] whose consciousness is not that of the Whole. That which initiates, seesthe end from the beginning and works towards the goal in progressive stages, notfor Itself but for those aspects which are still limited, unaware, blind andunseeing and unreasoning.2. It knows Itself as the transmitting will , working from the point ofsynthesis, stepping down the energies distributed, in line with the creative,evolutionary plan. This, the Life of our planet, carried forward in three majorstages, particularly from the consciousness angle; that is via Shamballa, theHierarchy and Humanity. From thence the transmitting Life moves outward into allthe other kingdoms of nature. Each great centre is, therefore, a transmittingagency. The fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human Kingdom, is the agent throughwhich eventually the energies of Shamballa and of the Hierarchy will be focussedfor the redeeming of the life of all the sub-human kingdoms. This can only takeplace when humanity can work with the focussed will, engendered by the life ofShamballa, inspired by love, fostered by the Hierarchy and expressed through theintellect which humanity itself has developed—all of these used dynamically andconsciously under the pressure of that which is higher and greater thanShamballa itself.3. It knows Itself as the transforming will or that sustained, applied processwhich brings about the needed mutations and changes through the action of theconstant incentive of the will-to-good. Yet at the same time it is notidentified in any way with the process. These mutations, producingtransformation of the One into the Many and later in time and space of the Manyinto the One are carried forward from a point of [618] focussed, dynamic will,the “Point in the Centre” which changes not but remains ever immovably subjectto its own inherent purpose.When the disciple or the initiate can stand also at the centre as thetransforming will, he can then bring about the needed changes in the form naturewithout identifying himself with it or being himself affected by the changes.This may serve to make my meaning clear.4. It knows Itself as the transfiguring will . This transfiguration is thefulfilment of purpose and the final expression of synthesis brought about by thesustaining will-to-good of the transcending, transmitting, transforming will.Students would do well to shift their eyes off the goal of transfiguration(achieved at the third initiation and increasingly present at each previousinitiation) and pay more attention to the recognition of that in them which“having pervaded their little universe with a fragment of itself remains .” Theywill then have anchored their consciousness in the centre of transcending powerand guaranteed the flow of the will-to-achieve. From that high point inconsciousness (imaginatively reached at first and practically achieved later)they would find it useful to work at the process of transmission, knowingthemselves to be agents for the transmission of the will-to-good of theTranscendent One. They should next pass on to the stage of transformationwherein they would visualise and expect to see developed the neededtransformation carried forward in their lives; then—equally expectant—theyshould believe in the transfiguration of those lives in line with the will ofthe [619] Transcendent One, the success of the Transmitting One, and theactivity of the Transforming One—all of Whom are but the One, the Monad, theSelf. All this is done by the use of the will, conditioning, fulfilling andovercoming.To return to our theme of the greater Whole, leaving behind us for a minute theefforts of the microcosm to comprehend the Macrocosm, let us consider therelation of the three constellations in the task of expressing Ray One:1. ARIES is the constellation through which initiating conditions will streaminto our solar system. It embodies the will-to-create that which will expressthe will-to-good. It is the monadic ray of our planetary Logos, Whose Soul rayis the second and the personality ray the third. You can note here, therefore,how the transmitting ray of our planetary Logos is the first; and hence theplace which the will plays in our human evolutionary process; His transformingray is the second and that eventually brings transfiguration through the mediumof the third and in this combination you have the reason why, in the evolutionof the will aspect, you have the influence of Mars and Mercury—the one bringingconflict and the death of the form and the other bringing illumination and thedevelopment of the intuition as a result of that conflict and death. New cyclesof Being and of consciousness are initiated by conflict. Such seems as yet to bethe law of life and the governing factor in evolution. If, however, the resultof this initiating, energising will is to produce such beneficent effects ofintuitive understanding and the activity of Mercury as the messenger of theGods, it can be seen how truly through conflict the will-to-good can be wroughtout.2. LEO . This is the constellation through which the will-to-fulfilment or toachievement pours into humanity and on to the planet. It is essentially thespirit of self-determination. [620] It is at first the determination of thelittle self, the personality, the self-conscious individual. It is next thedetermination of the Self, the soul, the group conscious individual, aware ofthe greater Whole and of itself as the part, integrated and basically at-one.This will-to-good (achieved through fulfilment) works out in relation to thehuman being through the medium of three climaxes:1. The will-to-good, demonstrated by the achieving of self-consciousness. Thisis the first stage of completed, divine fulfilment. It connotes body,appearance. It is the expression of the third aspect.2. The will-to-good, demonstrated at the third initiation whenself-consciousness gives place to group consciousness. This is the second stageof divine fulfilment. It connotes soul, quality. It is the expression of thesecond aspect.3. The will-to-good, demonstrated in the higher initiations whenGod-consciousness is achieved. This is the third stage of divine fulfilment. Itconnotes Monad, Life. It is the expression of the first aspect.It is useful to see these relationships. It will also be obvious why the Sunrules Leo, both exoterically and esoterically. The Sun reveals or “lights up”the two stages of the hidden will: the physical sun, lighting up the personalityupon the physical plane and the Heart of the Sun revealing the nature of thesoul.3. CAPRICORN . This is the constellation by means of which comes the conqueringwill which releases from form life and initiates the man into the kingdomwherein the will aspect (not the soul aspect) of divinity expresses itself. Youwill remember that there is a close connection between [621] the Earth andCapricorn. The reason for this is that the Earth provides ideal conditions forthis particular type of achievement because it is in process of transformingfrom the stage of a “non-sacred planet” into that of a “sacred planet.” This iswhy Saturn is so powerful a ruler and transmitter to the Earth of the dynamicquality of the first ray of power. This inpouring of first ray energy will begreatly accelerated from now on. These energies and their inflow must becarefully studied in connection with the diagrams given earlier in thistreatise, remembering that visualisation is always a directing energy , employedto bring about a specific desired effect.Aries, the Initiator, Leo, the Self, and Capricorn, the transfiguring Agent—suchare some of the implications in relation to the first ray and humanity.I would point out here that I have given this triangle of constellations in theorder of their relationship to the Great Life Who employs them as transmittingagencies for first ray activities. It should also be noted that the reason forthis relation is inherent in the nature of the informing Lives of the particularconstellations. They are Themselves expressions of the will-to-good and,therefore, constitute the line of least resistance for the dissemination offirst ray energy throughout our solar system. From the angle of human relations,this triangle rearranges itself. It becomes Leo, the giver ofself-consciousness; Capricorn, the sign wherein initiation can be taken; andAries, the incentive towards a new beginning. In the understanding of thesignificance of the distinction between constellations as galaxies of stars, andsigns as concentrated influences will come fresh light upon the science ofastrology. This is fundamentally connected with the difference between therelation of a ray energy to the triangle of constellations and the human [622]relation. More I may not say but this will give a hint to the intuitiveastrologer.RAY II. Love-Wisdom. Gemini, Virgo . . . . . working through the medium of thefive planets: Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, Pluto. Pisces.This “line of distribution” (if I may so express it) is related to the willwhich produces inevitable union, at-one-ment and synthesis, through the power ofattraction, based upon power to see the vision. In this solar system and duringthis world cycle and, therefore, upon our planet and throughout the periodwherein our planet moves from the position of a non-sacred to a sacred planet,this is the dominating will aspect of Deity; it is the energy with which ourplanetary Logos is preoccupied. It is that which has brought the Hierarchy intobeing, under the impact of the Shamballa or first ray force. It is, however,with hierarchical energy that humanity is, at this time, preoccupied. In my useof the word “preoccupied” in connection both with the planetary Logos andhumanity, you will find indication of a growing response between the twocentres, Shamballa and Humanity.Anent this ray energy, the esotericists of the world know much and this forthree reasons:1. The emphasis of all the teaching given out during the past three hundred andfifty years has been upon it.2. The two great exponents of this ray energy are the two best known worldTeachers and Saviours from the human point of view in both the East and theWest: the Buddha and the Christ.3. The two Masters Who have attempted to awaken humanity in the West to arealisation of the Hierarchy [623] are the Masters Morya and K.H., the twoworking in the closest relation and expressing first and second ray energy.The keynotes of illumination, of vision, of sight or of spiritual perception andof the fusion of the occidental or the mystic way are dominant in this cycle.The Buddha summed up in Himself all the light of the past as far as humanity wasconcerned. He was the culminating Messenger, and demonstrated the innatepossibilities of mankind, radiating the light of wisdom in relation to the lightof substance and producing that dual blaze or flaming light which had beenfanned and fostered (though not fully expressed) by humanity up to that time. Hecame forth as the flower or fruition of the past and as the guarantee of man’sinnate capacity. Christ, whilst able also to say “I am the light of the world,”went further in His manifestation and gave a vision of the next step,demonstrating the light of the soul and pointing to the future, thus presentingthat which could be because He had released on Earth the cosmic principle oflove. Love is an aspect of the will, which is a point very little realised bythe mass of men. It is the will to draw into itself or the will to attract intoitself, and this will, when exerted toward that which is not material, we, inreaction to the differentiating mind, call Love. But humanity has to see thatwhich must be loved before that power of the will is sufficiently evoked. Thenthe vision can become a manifestation and a fact in expression.It is here that the wonder of the work of Christ, the Lord of Love emerges intoour consciousness. He makes it very clear that this love which He demonstratedwas an aspect of the will, functioning through the medium of the second ray;this powerful love released into the world the [624] cosmic principle of love.Again the three aspects of the divine will can be seen functioning through thesecond ray:1. The will-to-initiate or to condition demonstrates in Christ’s work as Heinaugurates the era wherein it became possible for the kingdom of God to appearon Earth. In reality, this will be a demonstration of the fusion of the twocentres, Humanity and the Hierarchy. By fusion, I mean their complete reciprocalat-one-ment. It will inaugurate an era wherein—through increased capacity to seethe vision and increased power to identify oneself with the vision—a race of menwill be produced whose life expression will be that of love-wisdom.2. The will which brings fulfilment demonstrates through the second ray by themeans of that driving force which enables the second ray soul steadily toachieve its goal, relentlessly pushing forward, permitting itself no let-up orleeway until the desired goal is reached. This is a different expression to thewill of the first ray which is dynamic and which crashes forward in spite of allobstacles; the latter does not require the slower methods of the steady drive.3. It is also the will which conquers death because of its intense love ofreality and of that “persistent One” who exists behind all phenomena.In the Old Commentary this type of will—the will-to-love—is spoken of in thefollowing terms:“The Transcendent One said: I am alone. I must arise and seek with ceaselessurge, that which produces completion, round out my circle whole, intensity Mylife and make Me truly One, and this because I recognise the Two. I must haveunion with my other self, the self I dimly sense. [625]Unto My heart I drew that other One and drawing thus I gave enlightenment; Idowered with enrichments; I freely gave.”This embodies not the mystical vision of the other one but the will aspect ofthe planetary Logos, the incentive behind the life of Shamballa. It is the Lordof Sacrifice Who speaks. The keynote of sacrifice or the “process of makingwhole” runs through all that concerns the will aspect as it functions throughthe medium of the seven rays; this becomes beautifully apparent in the activityof the second ray as it is the channel for the will of God.It knows itself as the transcending will because behind its expression of cosmiclove (attracting, fusing and producing cohesion) lies a synthetic vision ofdivine Intention. It differentiates between process and goal, between initiationand that which is revealed by the initiatory process and that is something whichas yet is unknown to initiates below the third degree. Herein lies thedistinction between the Christ and the Buddha. The latter revealed the process,but the Christ embodied in Himself both goal and process. He revealed the cosmicprinciple of love and by its means—embodied in Himself—He produced effects alsoand momentous changes in the world through those presented to Him forinitiation.The second ray knows itself as the transmitting will because through its meanssomething passes between the pair of opposites (spirit-matter) which draws themtogether until eventually they form one blended whole. This is a basicmystery—the basic mystery of initiation and concerns the at-oning will whichfunctions through love. Its lowest expression and its most material symbol isthe love between the sexes.[626] It knows itself likewise as the transforming will because the entireevolutionary process (which is, in the last analysis, the working out of theinter-relation between God and His world, between cause and effect and betweenLife and form) is based upon the transformation brought about by divineattraction. This enables “spirit to mount upon the shoulders of matter,” asH.P.B. expresses it, and forces matter to achieve the purification which willlead it eventually to act as a transparent medium for the revelation ofdivinity.It knows itself finally as the will which transfigures . It was thistransfiguration which Christ manifested when He emerged before the startled eyesof His disciples as Light Incarnate and “was transfigured before them.”The entire process of transcendence, resulting in transfiguration, is worked outin relation to the second ray by the combined influences of the threeconstellations through which this ray chooses by an “act of its sufficient willto act in time and space.” Let us look at them for a moment:1. GEMINI . This is the great symbolic constellation of the Two Brothers,expressing the interplay between the dualities. Because it is governed byMercury and Venus, you have the light of the intuition and of the mind blendedtogether into one illuminated whole, typical of the fusion of spirit-matter andthe demonstration of their essential oneness. Gemini, as you know, is the signof divine interplay and it is the life of the Father (of spirit and of will)which flows through the Two Brothers, through the polar opposites, making themone in reality though two in manifestation. Their real nature as the “elderbrother and the prodigal son” is revealed by the intuition when it takes hold ofthe mind. But it is the will to love which governs the relationship and whichfinally brings about divine synthesis. [627]2. VIRGO is the constellation which is symbolic of the second stage of therelation between the pair of opposites. Here we have, as you know, the Mother ofthe Christ Child and the fostering process of interchange which brings aboutlife, love and their united manifestation in one form. This second ray is,therefore, closely related to Virgo and its lowest aspect is mother love withits instinctual care of that which must be nourished and guarded. Its highestaspect is the incarnated, manifested Christ. Then instinct is transmuted intowisdom and with that the will-to-manifest and bring into the light of day thehitherto Hidden Christ. This sign and this second ray Will have a mysteriousrelation to Time, to process and to the sustaining life of the Mother (matter)which, throughout the gestation period, nourishes and cares for the rapidlydeveloping Christ Child. The Moon has also a peculiar function which can only beexpressed in the idea of death—the death of the relationships between the Motherand the Child because the moment comes when the Christ Child will emerge fromthe womb of time and of matter and stand free in the light. This will have beendue, necessarily, to many inherent factors but primarily to the sustaining willof the Mother, plus the dynamic will of the Christ Child. Here again is anaspect of the curious and mysterious relation between the first and the secondrays.3. PISCES . In this sign the work is consummated and the will of the Fatherworks out through the second ray will as the will-to-save. In Gemini, therefore,you have the two, the pair of opposites and the will-to-relate; in Virgo, youhave their work in cooperation, the nurturing of the life of that second rayphenomenon, a Christ, the consummation of the task of matter and its elevationinto heaven. In Pisces, you have the consummation of the work of that [628]which the matter aspect has made possible, and the Christ emerges as the worldsaviour. All this has taken place through the will aspect of the second ray,focussed in Shamballa, expressing itself through humanity and consummated in theHierarchy. Here you have the whole story of unity, brought about by the life andthe will of the second ray, producing the emergence of the Christ consciousnessand the appearing in objectivity of the Christ principle.In time and space and from the angle of humanity, the triangle of constellationsis Virgo, Gemini and Pisces and not the order as here given, which is Gemini,Virgo, Pisces; the latter is the angle from the standpoint of Shamballa.RAY III. Active Cancer, Intelligence. Libra . . . . . . . . . . . . workingthrough five planets: The Moon, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus. Capricorn.In this divine expression of ray energy is to be found the key or clue to whatis commonly called evolution. The emphasis, is necessarily from the angle of theform nature and upon the phenomenal side. Today, however, the evolutionaryprocess can be considered from the two aspects of the evolution of form and theevolution of consciousness; science and psychology contribute to this agradually developing whole or picture. But that which I deal with here is theevolution of That which is both consciousness and form but which is more thaneither, i.e. the One Who wills to manifest and to know or to become aware. It isthis which lies behind and which is greater than the Identity in time and spaceto which we give the name Logos. I seek to deal, therefore, with the CreativeWill which is dynamically manifesting, consciously establishing contact andpersistently focussed in the form whilst time and space endure.[629] This third aspect of the divine expression is the result or outcome of theactivity of the other two major rays. You must, with care, distinguish in yourminds between matter or the Mother and substance or the “Holy Spiritovershadowing the Mother”; it is with this latter we are concerned, for we areregarding all these rays in terms of will, of spirit, and of life. This wholetreatise, therefore, deals with an idea which lies beyond or behind the entirecontent of modern knowledge and is consequently inexplicable to the finite mind.All that is possible is to indicate That which exists prior to manifestation andwhich persists after the cycle of manifestation is over—unprovable, unknowableand intangible. This inherent Reality is to the manifested Logos what thesensed, immortal Self is to the man in incarnation. As the abstract mind of mandevelops, these subjective themes, leading to the central Theme ofmanifestation, will become clearer and the density of the mystery will lighten.With this promise you must be content for you are not yet initiate. The initiatewill sense whereof I speak.This evolving Reality which is focussed in the third Ray of Active Intelligenceduring the “period of appearance” has—in this solar system—undertaken the taskof developing conscious “awareness of Itself in that which it is not.” This iscarried forward in three stages—all of them the result of process, of progress,of activity and of mind or intelligent perception. These three stages are:1. The stage wherein sensory perception is transmuted into knowledge. This isthe stage in which the form gradually and steadily adapts itself to therequirements of the perceiving Self.2. The stage wherein knowledge is transmuted into wisdom, [630] or consciousnessutilises the gradually acquired knowledge to achieve detachment from the form,the organ of perception.3. The stage wherein wisdom is transmuted into omniscience and bothconsciousness and form are superseded by the One Who exists, Who is conscious,but Who remains as greater than either of these two phases of divine life. ThisOne wills to incarnate, wills to know, wills to be conscious, but is none ofthese phases essentially, having realised them, prior to manifestation.This third ray will is the producer of external synthesis in successive stages,carried forward from temporary syntheses until there is complete unificationbetween consciousness and form and later complete atonement realised betweenThat which is neither consciousness nor form but the Creator of both and therelating Principle of spirit-matter. It will be seen how the above definitionshows the function of the third ray to be the will-to-initiate on the physicalplane that which will express divinity; that it defines not only appearance butthe revelation of that quality of which the appearance is the effect or result,and that inherent in these two propositions lies the third which states thatthis creative will is not only the cause of manifestation and the guarantee ofachievement, but is also the proof of the potency of that Life which everdefeats and annihilates death. So, we come back to our initial proposition ofthat divine trinity of Life-Quality-Appearance (considered in the opening pagesof Volume I); thus also to the creativity of the three major rays; thus to theirbasic relation and thus to their enduring and persistent synthesis. The circleof revelation is rounded out; the cycle is completed; the serpent of matter, theserpent of wisdom and the serpent of life are seen to be one [631] whole andbehind the three “stands the Eternal Dragon for ever spawning forth the tripleserpent, for ever saying: Go forth and come thou back.” Thus speaks the OldCommentary in reference to this matter.Three words are concerned with this triple manifestation: Attraction,Subtraction, Abstraction and these three are related (as far as man isconcerned) to the first three initiations, but only from the will aspect and inrelation definitely to the third ray upon the physical plane, or rather on theplane of the etheric body or the vital effective activity. It is this which mustbe borne in mind when considering the active work of the Trinity: Father, Sonand Holy Spirit.This Trinity in manifestation knows Itself as the Transcending Reality andutters ever the word: “Having pervaded this whole universe with a fragment ofMyself, I remain.”This Trinity in manifestation knows Itself as the Transmitting One and saysthrough the words of the Christ: “I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men untoMe.” This, through the attractive power which the Transmitting One transmits.This Trinity in manifestation knows Itself to be the Transforming Agent andthrough the voice of the many chants the words: “Glory to God in the highest, onEarth peace, goodwill to men”—glory, peace and the will-to-good being theeffects of the transmitted life of the Transcendent One.Finally, at the end of the age, it knows Itself as the Transfigured One andrealises that the paean of the angels: “Glory to God in the highest” is theenunciation of its ultimate perfection and triumph.Can more be said anent this subject? The major Rays of Aspect embody the entirestory; the minor Rays of Attribute contribute the detail in process andenterprise. They [632] are conditioned by the three major rays. It is not,therefore, my intention to take up the analysis of the four remaining triangles.I have indicated enough in this treatise to enable the interested student towork out for himself their subjective theme. I will, however, consider brieflythe three constellations connected with the third ray; their significance isrelatively clear.1. CANCER . This is the constellation which symbolises the will of the mass,which conditions mass response and mass psychology. This has not yet been thetheme of astrological study for it connotes far more than the massconsciousness. It is basically the focussing of the mass will through the mediumof the mass consciousness—a thing unknown as yet, though the rudiments of thisknowledge can be seen in that peculiar factor in the life of humanity which wecall ‘public opinion.’ This is now being brought into the educational fieldthrough what is commonly called propaganda. The implications will be clear toyou. A trained and enlightened public opinion is an unknown thing on aworld-wide scale, though enlightened groups are rapidly appearing. Out of publicopinion (which is the focussed expression of the growth of mass consciousness)will emerge the mass will-to-good, inherent in every individual; for thishumanity must work and wait.2. LIBRA . This constellation, as you know, connotes the point of balance in thelong relationship and interplay between the pairs of opposites. It indicates thewill-to-express—in perfected proportion and harmony—both the life of the spiritand the potency of matter.3. CAPRICORN . This constellation stands for the influence which will carry thewill of Shamballa to the Hierarchy or to the world initiates, giving to Themthat dynamic and [633] enterprising spirit which will enable Them to carryforward to completion the Will of God on Earth. It was the “angel, born underCapricorn” which came to Christ in the garden of Gethsemane and fused Hisindividual will into the divine Will and thus enabled Him to carry out Hismission to completion. This was not only the revelation of divine love to theworld but—as the legend in the Masters’ Archives goes on—He came “to fabricatethe gossamer thread which bound the two together and linked the place of theMost High (Shamballa) with the Holy City (The Hierarchy). The bridge between theHoly Place and the Holy of Holies was securely anchored. The will of God couldnow be carried to fruition.” Under the same symbolic teaching, we could say thatthe following terms distinguish the three rays with which we have been dealing.I. Ray I. The Holy of Holies. Shamballa. The Dwelling Place of the Most High.Spirit. Life. Energy. Will. Identification. II. Ray II. The Holy Place.Hierarchy. The Secret Place where Light dwelleth. Soul. Consciousness. Light.Love. Initiation. III. Ray III. The Outer Court. Humanity. Christ in us, thehope of glory. Form. Appearance. Body. Intelligence. Individuality.Remember, nevertheless, that these Three are One. Behind all of them stands forever the One Who remains, transcendent [634] and immanent also, greater than ourwhole yet also within that whole.Through Ray IV, we learn to be at-one with this eternal synthesis and will;through Ray V, we develop the means to understand the nature of that synthesisand will; through Ray VI, we move forward to complete identification with thatsynthesis and will, and through Ray VII we demonstrate on Earth the nature ofthat synthesis through the medium of the appearing form and the purpose of thatunderlying will.And so the Many are absorbed into the One."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX - SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDENTSASTROLOGY IN THE SECRET DOCTRINE(Third Edition)[635] 1.

Stars and constellations have an occult and mysterious influence on, andconnection with, individuals. And if with the latter, why not with nations,races and mankind as a whole? This again is a claim made on the authority of theZodiacal records. (S.D. I. 709.)a. There are records preserved through the Zodiac for incalculable ages. (S.D.I. 709.)b. Astronomy, astrology and so on are all on the physical and not on thespiritual plane. (S.D. II. 667.)c. Those philosophers alone who studied astrology ... knew that the last word ofthose sciences was to be sought in and expected from the occult forces emanatingfrom the constellations. (S.D. III. 214.)9. “... In the presence of the Eternal conformity of the divisions of the Zodiacand of the names of the Planets applied in the same order everywhere and alwaysand in the presence of the impossibility of attributing it all to chance andcoincidence ... a very great antiquity indeed must be allowed for the Zodiac.(S.D. I. 711.)10. High ceremonial astrology ... depends upon the knowledge of the Initiate ofthose immaterial Forces and spiritual Entities that affect matter and guide it.(S.D. III. 337.)11. “... our Earth was created or fashioned by terrestrial [637] spirits, theRegents (the Spirits of the seven planets. A.A.B.) being simply the supervisors.This is the first germ of that which grew later into the Tree of Astrology andAstrolatry.” (S.D. II. 26.)12. “There are seven chief groups of such Dhyan Chohans. They are the primevalseven Rays.... Hence there are seven chief planets, the spheres of theindwelling seven Spirits, under each of which is born one of the human groups.”(S.D. I. 626.)13. “There are only seven planets specially connected with the Earth and twelvehouses, but the possible combination of their aspects are countless. As eachplanet can stand to each of the others in twelve different aspects theircombinations must be almost infinite.” (S.D. I. 626.)14. That which is the surviving Entity in us is partly the direct emanation fromand partly those celestial entities themselves. (S.D. I. 251.)15. The descent and reascent of the monad or soul cannot be disconnected fromZodiacal signs.... (S.D. I. 730.)16. The following five statements are basic—1. Each of the Primordial Seven, the first seven rays, forming the manifestinglogos, is again sevenfold.2. As the seven colours of the solar spectrum correspond to the seven rays orHierarchies so each of these is sub-divided into seven.3. Each of these Hierarchies furnishes the essence (the soul) and is the builderof one of the seven kingdoms in nature—the three elemental kingdoms, themineral, vegetable, animal and kingdom of spiritual man. [638]4. Each Hierarchy furnishes the aura of one of the seven principles in man withits specific colour.5. Each of these Hierarchies is the ruler of one of the sacred planets.Thus astrology came into existence and has a strictly scientific basis. (S.D.III. 482.)17. All the great astrologers have admitted that man could react against thestars. (S.D. III. 339.)18. This system (or cycles) cannot be comprehended if the spiritual action ofthese periods—pre-ordained so to say by karmic law—is separated from theirphysical course. The calculations of the best astrologers would fail, or at anyrate remain imperfect, unless this dual action is thoroughly taken intoconsideration and mastered upon these lines. This mastery can be achieved onlythrough initiation. (S.D. I. 703.)19. Modern astrologers do not give the correspondences of the days and planetsand colours correctly.20. There is white and black astrology ... the good or bad results obtained donot depend upon the principles which are the same in both kinds, but upon theastrologer himself. (S.D. III. 339.)NOTE: S.D. I, Section XVI and S.D. III, Section XXXVIII deal with the Zodiac,with Biblical references to the Zodiac and with astrology and the mysteries ofInitiation.THE CONSTELLATIONS1. “Each of the twelve constellations, whether separately or in combination withother signs, has an occult influence, either for good or evil.” (S.D. I. 440.)[639]2. “Enoch, the type of the dual nature of man (spiritual and physical) occupiesthe centre of the astronomic Cross ... which is a six-pointed star.... In theupper angle of the upper triangle is the Eagle (Scorpio); in the left lowerangle stands the Lion (Leo); in the right, the Bull (Taurus); while between theBull and the Lion ... is the face of Enoch, the man (Aquarius).... These are thefour animals of Ezekiel and Revelations.” (S.D. II. 561, 562.)(The Fixed Cross of the Heavens)3. “The constellations of the Great Bear and of the Pleiades constitute thegreatest mystery of occult nature.” (S.D. II. 580.)4. “From the beginning of humanity, the Cross, or Man, with arms stretched outhorizontally (the Fixed Cross) typifying his cosmic origin, was connected withhis psychic nature and with the struggles which led to initiation.” (S.D. III.141.)NOTE: All the travels of all the Heroes of antiquity through the signs of thesun and the heavens ... are in each individual case, the personification of thesufferings, triumphs, and miracles of an adept before and after initiation.5. The signs of the zodiac: Each a double sign in ancient astrologicalmagic—namely: it was Taurus-Eve; and Scorpio was Mars-Lupa, or Mars with thefemale wolf.... So as these signs were opposites of each other, yet met in thecentre they are connected; ... (S.D. III. 154.)References in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire .[640] 6. “Until the mystery of the Great Bear is revealed and is known as it is,and until the influence of Pleiades is comprehended, and the true significanceof the cosmic Triangle formed by1. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear,2. The seven planetary Logoi of our solar system,3. The seven Pleiades or Sisters,is revealed, the karma of the seven sacred planets will remain unknown. All thatwe can see is its working out in the solar system. The intricacy of the wholesubject will be apparent when it is borne in mind that not only do these threegroups form a cosmic triangle, but that within that triangle many lessertriangles have to be studied. Any one of the seven Rishis with one of the sevenSisters may form a subsidiary triangle, and all must thus be studied.” (C.F.801.)7. “A further factor in cyclic computation lies in the effect of the followingstars and constellations upon our system and upon any particular planet withinthe system:1. The Great Bear. 4. The Pleiades. 2. The little Bear. 5. ConstellationCapricorn. (Ursa Minor) 6. Draco. 3. The Pole Star.And all the other constellations and allied stars of the zodiac. The mystery ishidden in esoteric astrology and until the subject of energy, working throughthe etheric body, of radio-activity and of the transmutation of all bodies froma lower state into a higher is better comprehended, the true mystery of the“influence of [641] these various bodies upon each other will remain at itspresent stage—an unrevealed secret.” (C.F. 795.)8. Energy in the universe can be differentiated as follows:“1. Inter-cosmic—affecting constellations.2. Inter-planetary—affecting planets.3. Inter-chain—affecting the chains in a planetary cycle.4. Inter-globular—producing interchange of force between the globes of a chain.5. Inter-sectional—affecting the transference of force between the kingdoms innature.6. Inter-human—interplay between men.7. Inter-atomic—passage of force between atoms.” (C.F. 1029.)9. “There must also be borne in mind the play of energy which emanates from anyone of the twelve constellations or signs of the zodiac, with which astrologyconcerns itself. This type of force is primarily concerned with planetarystimulation, with the planetary Logoi, and is hidden in Their cyclic karma—akarma which will incidentally involve those monads and devas which form Theirbodies and centres.” (C.F. 1052.)10. “These three groups of solar bodies (The Great Bear, the Pleiades andSirius) are of paramount influence where the spiral cyclic activity of oursystem is concerned. Just as in the human atom, the spiral activity is egoic andcontrolled from the egoic body, so in connection with the solar system thesethree groups are related to the Logoic Spiritual Triad—atma-buddhi-manas—andtheir influence is dominant in connection with solar incarnation, with solarevolution and with solar progress.” (C.F. 1058.) [642]THE PLANETS1. “There are seven chief planets, the spheres of the indwelling seven Spirits.These seven Spirits are:a. The seven chief groups of Dhyan Chohans.b. The seven Primeval Rays.” (S.D. I. 626.)2. “There are only seven planets specially connected with the Earth, and twelvehouses, but the possible combinations of their aspects are countless.... Eachplanet can stand to each of the other in twelve different aspects.” (S.D. I.626.)3. “The names of the Planets are applied in the same order everywhere andalways.” (S.D. I. 711.)4. “The Seven Planetary Regents (Planetary Logoi) are `the Seven Sons of Sophia(Wisdom)’.” (S.D. II. 221. Note.)5. “For Pythagoras the forces were Spiritual Entities, Gods, independent ofplanets and Matter as we see and know them on Earth, who are the rulers of theSidereal Heaven.” (S.D. I. 535.)6. “The seven Sons of Light—called after their planets and often even identifiedwith them—namely, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Venus and presumably the Sunand the Moon.” (S.D. I. 628.)7. “The planets have their growth, changes, development and gradual evolution.”(S.D. I. 667.)8. “Plato represented the planets as moved by an intrinsic Rector ... one withhis dwelling, like a `boatman in his boat’.” (S.D. I. 535.)a. “The planets were not inanimate masses but acting and living bodies.”b. “The planets were rational intelligences circulating around the sun.” (S.D.I. 535.) [643]9. “The seven planets have for supreme Spirits, Fortune and Destiny, who upholdthe eternal stability of the laws of Nature throughout incessant transformationand perpetual agitation. The ether is the instrument or medium by which all isproduced.” (S.D. I. 735.)10. “The seven Gods were divided into two triads and the sun.a. Lower Triad—Mars, Mercury and Venus.b. Higher Triad—Moon, Jupiter and Saturn.(the Moon standing for a hidden planet.) (S.D. II. 484, 5.)11. “Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus are the four exoteric planets and threeothers which must remain nameless (Pluto and the two hidden planets. A.A.B.)were the heavenly bodies in direct astral and psychic communication—morally andphysically—with the Earth, its Guides and Watchers. The visible orbs furnish ourhumanity with its outward and inward characteristics and their Regents orRectors with our Monads and spiritual faculties.” (S.D. I. 628.)12. “The Trinity was represented by the Sun (the Father), Mercury (the Son), andVenus (the Holy Spirit).” (S.D. II. 569.)13. “There were seven tabernacles ready to be inhabited by Monads under sevendifferent karmic conditions.” (S.D. II. 223.)14. “Every race in its evolution is said to be born under the influence of oneof the planets.” (S.D. II. 27.)15. “The Tradition of the 70 planets that preside over the destiny of nations isbased on the occult cosmogonical teaching that besides our own systemic chain ofWorld [644] Planets there are many more in the solar system.” (S.D. I. 718,note.)16. “The spirit of the planet is as much a creator in his own realm as theSpirit of the heavens (i.e. the form life and the soul life of the planet.A.A.B.).” (S.D. II. 500.)17. “The seven planets are the Sun’s brothers and not his sons.” (S.D. I. 483.)18. “The Planetary Spirits, are the informing spirits of the stars in generaland of the planet especially. They rule the destinies of men who are all bornunder one or other of their constellations.” (S.D. I. 153.)19. “Each of the planets (of which seven only are called sacred because ruled bythe highest Regents or Gods) ... is a septenary”.... (S.D. I. 176.)20. The following tabulation is suggestive:a. God the Father—1st Logos—Electric Fire. Great Bear. Sun.b. God the Son—2nd Logos—Solar Fire—Sirius. Venus and Mercury.c. God the Holy Spirit—3rd Logos—Fire by friction—Pleiades. Saturn (C.F. 96.)21. “The planetary Spirit is another term for the Logos of a planet, Who is oneof the “seven Spirits before the Throne of God” and therefore one of the sevenHeavenly Men. He is on the evolutionary arc of the Universe and has passed manystages beyond the human. The planetary Entity is on the involutionary arc and isa very low grade entity. He is the sum total of all the elemental lives of theplanet.” (C.F. 105, note.)22. “The seven sacred Planets are composed of matter of [645] the fourth etherand the planetary Logoi (the seven Heavenly Men) whose bodies the planets are,function normally on the fourth plane of the system, the buddhic plane.” (C.F.121.)23. “Certain of the planets are to the Logos what the permanent atoms are toman. They embody principles. Certain planets afford only temporary homes tothese principles. This is one of the distinctions between a sacred and anon-sacred planet.” (C.F. 299.)24. “Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Vulcan are still developing the mindprinciple.” (C.F. 403.)25. “Those who are working in the Uranus, the Neptune and the Saturn scheme worksomewhat differently to those functioning in the Venus, the Vulcan, the Mars,the Mercury, the Jupiter, the Earth and the exoteric Saturn scheme, and so dothe Manasadevas (the solar Angels) of the inner round. We should note here thatwe again have a triplicity of groups, representing a triplicity of forces andherein lies a hint. In the others, the higher group and the middle group holdsway as these planets are the most occult and sacred in manifestation, and areconcerned with egos who are on the Path, and who are therefore group-active. Inconnection with Uranus, Neptune and Saturn, this might be expected as they arethe synthesising planetary schemes, and provide conditions suitable only for thevery advanced stages. They are called the ‘reaping’ planets.” (C.F. 777.)26. “Mercury and Venus, the Sun and the Moon constitute the ‘Guardian angels ofthe four corners of the Earth’.”[646]NOTE:a. (The sun and moon veil hidden planets).b. These are the four Maharajahs, connected with karma, humanity, cosmos andman.c. They are the Sun or its substitute—Michael.They are the Moon or its substitute—Gabriel.They are Mercury or its substitute—Raphael.They are Venus or its substitute—Uriel. (S.D. III. 459.)27. “Saturn—governs the devotional faculties.Mercury—governs the intellectual faculties.Jupiter—governs the sympathetic faculties.The Sun—governs the governing faculties.Mars—governs the selfish faculties.Venus—governs the tenacious faculties.Moon—governs the instinctual faculties.” (S.D. III. 463.)28. “The seven Angels Who preside over the seven planets are the Builders of theUniverse. They are the natural Guardians of the seven regions of our planetarysystem.” (S.D. III. 115.)29. “The seven Builders graft the divine and the beneficent forces on to thegross material nature of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms every Second Round.”(S.D. III. 162; Note, I.)30. “The seven planetary Spirits or Angels ... are identical with the DhyanChohans of the esoteric doctrine and have been transformed into the archangelsand the Spirits of the Presence by the Christian Church.” (S.D. III. 160.)31. “The seven chief Deities ... are the rays of the One Boundless Unity.” (S.D.III. 229.) [647]32. “Each of the seven chambers of the Pyramid was known by the name of one ofthe planets.” (S.D. III. 247.)33. “The Kabiri were always the seven planets ... who together with theirFather, the Sun ... composed a powerful ogdoad.” (S.D. III. 316.)34. “The Ancients knew of seven planets besides the sun.... The seventh with twoothers were mystery planets.” (S.D. III. 316. Note.)35. “The solar system is (from the higher cosmic planes), seen as a vast bluelotus and so on down the scale; even the tiny atom of substance can be soconsidered.... The solar system is a twelve-petalled lotus, each petal beingformed of forty-nine lesser petals. The planetary lotuses differ in each schemeand one of the secrets of initiation is revealed when the number of petals of:a. Our earth planetb. Our planetary polar oppositec. Our complementary equilibrising planetis committed to the initiate.” (C.F. 1018.).36. “Within the Hall of Wisdom, there exists a department of which the modernastrological organisations are dim and uncertain reflections. The Adeptsconnected with it work not with humanity but concern Themselves specificallywith “casting the horoscopes” of the various great lives who inform ... thekingdoms of nature, with ascertaining the nature of the karmic influencesworking out in the manifestation of the three planetary Logoi (mentioned underpoint 35 above).... They progress these various horoscopes [648] for the nextstated cycle and Their records are of profound interest. I would conjurestudents to refrain from attempting to form cyclic computations of any kind foras yet the many constellations which exist only in physical matter of an ethericnature are unknown and unseen. Yet they are potent in influence and untiletheric vision is developed, all calculations will be full of error.” (C.F.1057.)37. “A planetary Logos is the meeting place for two types of force, spiritual orlogoic, which reaches Him ... from the seven Rishis of the Great Bear on Theirown plane, and, secondly, of buddhic force which is transmitted via the sevenSisters or the Pleiades from a constellation called The Dragon and from whichhas come the appellation ‘The Dragon of Wisdom’.” (C.F. 1162.)TABULATIONSRelated to AstrologyThe Rays and the Planets—(According to Besant)Ray Method Planet ColourI.

Of these our Earth is one but being alignedin a peculiar fashion with certain spheres (or planets) on the inner round adual opportunity exists for humanity which facilitates, whilst it complicates,the evolutionary process.

The kingdom of souls—Neptune and Uranus 6. Synthesising these five—TheSunTHE RAYS AND THE PLANETS[651] Each of the seven sacred planets (of which our Earth is not one) is anexpression of one of the seven ray influences. These seven planets may beenumerated as follows, and the rays working through them are accurately given.The student, however, must remember three things:1. That every planet is the incarnation of a Life, or an Entity or Being.2. That every planet, like a human being, is the expression of two rayforces—the personality and the egoic.3. That two rays are therefore in esoteric conflict in each planet.It should also be noted that until the mystery of the constellation of the GreatBear is revealed, and until the influence of the Pleiades is comprehended andthe true significance of the cosmic triangle formed by:a. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear.b. The seven Planetary Logoi of our solar system.c. The seven Pleiades or Sisters.is also revealed, the destiny and true function of the seven sacred planets willremain unknown. Within this cosmic triangle are many lesser ones. Any one of theseven Rishis with one of our planetary Logoi and one of the seven Sisters canform subsidiary triangles and the combinations possible are many and intricate.NOTE: In the occult books there are many enumerations of the planets and many ofthese are simply blinds and the sacred and non-sacred planets are deliberatelyintermixed. In the Tibetan’s books there are several such enumerations, i.e.,the two listed above and the following: [652]The Seven Planets, Centres or Schemes1. Vulcan—the sun exoterically considered.2.

(Felt by environment.)THE SEVEN STARS OF THE GREAT BEARReferences in The Secret Doctrine and A Treatise on Cosmic Fire1. “The seven Rishis are the Regents of the seven stars of the Great Bear, and,therefore, of the same nature as the Angels of the Planets or the seven greatplanetary Spirits.” (S.D. II. 332. Note.)2. “It is the seven Rishis who mark the time and the duration of events in ourseptenary life cycle. They are as mysterious as their supposed wives, thePleiades.” (S.D. II. 579.)3. “The first ‘seven stars’ are not planetary. They are the leading stars ofseven constellations which turn [656] around with the Great Bear....” (S.D. III.195.)4. “In Egypt, the Great Bear was the constellation ... called the Mother of theRevolutions, and the Dragon with seven heads was assigned to Saturn, who wascalled the Dragon of Life.” (S.D. III. 195.)5. “In the Book of Enoch, the Great Bear is called Leviathan.” (S.D. III. 195.)6. “Our solar system with the Pleiades and one of the stars of the Great Bearform a cosmic triangle or an aggregation of three centres in the Body of the Oneabout Whom Naught may be Said.... The seven stars of the Great Bear correspondto the seven head centres of this Great Entity.” (Cosmic Fire, 182.)7. “Vibrations (energies) come to our solar system from the seven Rishis of theGreat Bear and primarily from those two who are the Prototypes of the seventhand fifth Rays or planetary Logoi.” (Cosmic Fire, 553.)8. “Cosmic Avatars ‘represent embodied force from Sirius, and from that one ofthe seven stars of the Great Bear which is ensouled by the Prototype of the Lordof the third major Ray, the third planetary Logos’.” (Cosmic Fire, 723.)9. “Cosmic evil from the standpoint of our planet consists in the relationbetween that spiritual, intelligent Unit or Rishi of the SuperiorConstellation—the informing Life of one of the seven stars of the Great Bear andour planetary prototype and one of the forces of the Pleiades.... In thisrelation, at present lacking perfect adjustment, lies hid the mystery of cosmicevil.... When the heavenly triangle is duly equilibrated and the forcecirculates freely through one of the stars of the Great Bear, the Pleiadinvolved and the planetary [657] scheme concerned, then cosmic evil will benegated and a relative perfection achieved.” (Cosmic Fire, 990.)10. “Great waves of energy sweep cyclically through the entire solar system fromthe seven stars of the Great Bear. The strength of these vibrations depends uponthe closeness of the connection and the accuracy of the alignment between anyparticular Heavenly Man and His Prototype.” (Cosmic Fire, 1052.)THE SEVEN SISTERS, THE PLEIADESReferences in The Secret Doctrine1. “The Pleiades are the supposed wives of the seven Rishis of the Great Bear.They are also the nurses of the God of War, Mars, the commander of the celestialarmies.” (II. 579.)2. “The Pleiades are the central group of the system of sidereal astronomy.a. They are found in the neck of the Bull, the constellation Taurus.b. They are therefore in the Milky Way.c. They are thus considered (Alcyone, in particular) as the central point aroundwhich our universe of fixed stars revolves.” (II. 582.)3. “The number seven is closely connected with the occult significance of thePleiades, the six present and the 7th hidden.” (II. 654.)4. “The Pleiades were at one time the Atlantides and connected with Atlantis andits seven races.” (II. 811.)5. “One of the most esoteric cycles is based upon certain conjunctions andrespective positions of Virgo and the Pleiades.” (II. 454.) [658]From A Treatise on Cosmic Fire6. “The Pleiades are to the solar system the source of electrical energy and,just as our sun is the embodiment of the heart or love aspect of the Logos (Whois Himself the heart of the One about Whom Naught may be Said), so the Pleiadesare the feminine opposite of Brahma.” (The third aspect. Page 156.)7. “Our solar system, with the Pleiades and one of the stars of the Great Bear,form a cosmic triangle or an aggregation of centres in the body of the One aboutWhom Naught may be Said.” (182.)8. “Two other systems, when allied with our solar system and the Pleiades make alower quaternary.” (182.)9. “The sun, Sirius, is the source of the Logoic mind (manas) in the same sensethat the Pleiades are connected with the evolution of mind in the seven HeavenlyMen and Venus was responsible for the coming of mind to the Earth.” (347.)10. “Sirius, the Pleiades and our Sun form a cosmic triangle.” (375.)11. “The Pleiades are negatively polarised to our seven schemes.” (377.)12. “Our seven planetary Logoi are transmitters, via Their seven schemes to theseven stars of the Pleiades.” (378.)13. “Three constellations are connected with the fifth logoic principle in itsthreefold manifestation: Sirius, two of the Pleiades and a small constellationwhose name must be intuitively ascertained.” (699.)14. “Three great waves of energy sweep cyclically through [659] the entire solarsystem from ... the Seven Sisters, the Pleiades, from that one in particular whois occultly termed “the wife” of the planetary Logos whose scheme willeventually receive the seeds of life from our planet which is not considered asacred planet....” (1052.)15. “Cosmic evil ... consists in the relation between that spiritual intelligentunit or ‘Rishi of the Superior Constellation,’ as He is called (Who is theinforming Life of one of the seven stars of the Great Bear) and our planetaryPrototype and one of the forces of the Pleiades.... The Seven Sisters areoccultly called the ‘seven wives’ of the Rishis....” (990.)SIRIUSReferences from The Secret Doctrine and A Treatise on Cosmic Fire1. “Sirius was called the ‘Dog Star.’ It was the star of Mercury, or Buddha,called the ‘Great Instructor of mankind.’” (S.D. II. 391.)2. “The sun, Sirius, is the source of the Logoic mind (manas) in the same senseas the Pleiades are connected with the evolution of mind in the Seven HeavenlyMen and Venus is responsible for the coming in of mind in the Earth chain.” (T.on C.F. 347.)3. “Sirius, the Pleiades and our Sun form a cosmic triangle.” (375.)4. “Our solar system is negatively polarised as regards the sun Sirius, whichinfluences our entire system psychically, via the three synthesising schemes:Uranus, Neptune and Saturn.” (378.) [660]5. “Vibrations reach us from Sirius, via the cosmic mental plane.” (553.)6. “The Lords of Karma on our system are under the rule of a greater Lord ofKarma on Sirius. We are governed by the Sirian Lord of Karma.” (570.)7. “The consciousness of the cosmic mental plane is the goal of attainment forour solar Logos and the Sirian Logos is to our solar Logos what the human Ego(or soul) is to the human personality.” (592.)8. “Three constellations are connected with the fifth logoic principle in itsthreefold manifestation: Sirius, two of the Pleiades and a small constellationwhose name must be intuitively ascertained.” (699.)9. Cosmic Avatars “... represent embodied forces from the following cosmiccentres: Sirius, and that one of the seven stars of the Great Bear which isensouled by the Prototype of the Lord of the third Ray, and our own cosmiccentre.” (723.)a. Only one Being (from Sirius) has visited our system and that was at the timeof individualisation.b. They only appear usually and normally at the initiation of a solar Logos.(723.)THE PLANET—JUPITERReferences in The Secret Doctrine1. “Jupiter ... is a deity who is the symbol and prototype of ... ritualisticworship. He is the priest, sacrificer, suppliant and the medium through whichthe prayers of mortals reach the Gods.” (II. 49. Note.)2. Jupiter is regarded as the “throne of Brahma.” (II. 829.) [661]3. “Jupiter is the personification of cyclic law.” (II. 830.)4. “The sun used to be called the `eye of Jupiter.’” (III. 278.)5. “Plato makes Jupiter the Logos, the Word of the sun.” (III. 279.)6. “The Mysteries ... were presided over by Jupiter and Saturn.”7. “Occultism makes Jupiter blue because he is the son of Saturn.”8. “The sign of the Messiah’s coming is the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter inthe sign of Pisces.” (III. 152.)References in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire9. “Venus, Jupiter and Saturn might be considered from the standpoint of thepresent time , as the vehicles of the three super or major principles.

In answer to the questions: “What planets of those known to ordinary science,besides Mercury, belong to our system of world...,” the reply was Mars and fourother planets of which astronomy knows nothing. The inference is that theseplanets, A.B. and Y.Z. exist in etheric matter. (I. 187.) [662]2. “As to Mars, Mercury and the ‘four other planets,’ they bear relation to theEarth of which no Master ... will ever speak....” (I. 187.)3. Mars is in a state of obscuration at present:a.

Mercury, the Earth and Mars are closely alliedto these three but a hidden mystery lies here.” (299.)14. “The second hint I seek to give lies in the triangle formed by the Earth,Mars and Mercury. In connection with this triangle, the analogy lies in the factthat Mercury and the centre at the base of the spine in the human being areclosely allied. Mercury demonstrates kundalini in intelligent activity whilstMars demonstrates kundalini latent.” (181.)15. “In the middle of the fifth round, the Lord of Mercury will, with the Logosof the Venus scheme and of our Earth, form a temporary triangle of force.”(371.)THE PLANET—THE MOON (veiling a planet)References in The Secret Doctrine1. “The moon is now the cold residual quantity, the shadow dragged after the newbody, into which her living powers are transfused. She now is doomed for longages to be ever pursuing the Earth, to be attracted by and to attract herprogeny. Constantly vampirized by her child, she revenges herself on it, bysoaking it through and through with the nefarious, invisible and poisonousinfluence which emanates from the occult side of her nature.

I. 126. Note.) (Thereforewhen it is included among the planets, as it is, it is simply because it standsfor or veils a hidden planet.)2. The sun is merely one of those suns which ... “are sunflowers of a higherlight.” It is “dwelling in the vehicle of a God or of a host of Gods, likemilliards of other suns.” (S.D. I. 319.)3. “The sun is the storehouse of vital force which is the noumenon ofelectricity.” (S.D. I. 579.)4. “The sun was not a sacred planet.” (S.D.

II. 27.)10. “The sun Sirius, is the source of the Logoic mind (manas) in the same senseas the Pleiades are connected with the evolution of mind in the seven Heavenly[674] Men and Venus is responsible for the coming in of mind in the Earthchain.” (C.F. 347.)11. “There is a psychic link between the planetary Logos of Venus and that ofour Earth.a. The Venus scheme is more active than ours.b. Its humanity are more advanced than ours.c. Its radiation includes the buddhic plane as far as its humanity areconcerned.d. It could therefore open up, through stimulation, the same plane to our Earthhumanity.” (C.F. 367.)12. “Venus is the second or the sixth scheme, according to whether the schemesare counted mystically or occultly.” (C.F. 595.)13. “Venus is negatively polarised and hence it became possible for a mysteriousabsorption by the Earth of Venusian force ... the karmic tie between the twoplanetary Logoi (one in a positive incarnation and the other in a negative)caused a planetary alliance. Light flashed forth.” (C.F. 323.)14. “The Lord of Venus:a. Holds place in the Logoic Quaternary.b.

[675]16. “Venus, Jupiter and Saturn might be considered from the standpoint of thepresent time as the vehicles of the three super or major principles. Mercury,the Earth and Mars are closely allied to these three but a hidden mystery lieshere.” (C.F. 299.)17. “In the human system, the right eye corresponds with Buddhi and Mercury andthe left eye with manas and Venus.” (S.D. III. 447. 458.)18. “In the middle of the fifth round, the Logos of Mercury will, with the Logosof Venus, and of our Earth form a temporary triangle of force.” (C.F. 371.)19. “Venus and Jupiter are closely connected with the Earth and form eventuallyan esoteric triangle.” (C.F. 370.)20. “Venus, being in the fifth round, had the mind principle coordinated anddeveloped and four minor mental aspects had been synthesised and the buddhicaspect was being provided with a means of expression through the medium of thefifth principle.” (C.F. 376.)21.

This level is the lowest one on which theseinter-planetary deities appear. No more can be communicated on this matter. Themystery of the goat lies hidden here. This avatar makes His appearance in thethird round of the third chain and disappears in the fifth round of the fourthchain.” (727.)GEMINI—THE THIRD SIGN OF THE ZODIACReferences in The Secret Doctrine1. “Castor and Pollux, the bright Gemini, were born from Leda’s egg.” (I. 392.)2. “The legend of Castor and Pollux is concerned with the mortal half of man,the personality, and the immortal part, the ego or spiritual individual. Thepersonality has nothing in itself to survive and the other half which becomesimmortal in its individuality by reason of its fifth principle being called tolife by the Informing Gods , thus connecting the Monad with this Earth. This isPollux, while Castor represents the personal, mortal man an animal of not even asuperior kind, when unlinked from the divine Individuality .” (II. 130)a. “Castor owes his immortality to Pollux.b. Pollux sacrifices himself to Castor.” (II. 130.)

(II. 413.)a. The second racial initiation.b. The first planetary initiation.”2. Pisces ... “shines as a symbol of the past, present and future spiritualSaviours.” (I. 717.)3. “Kepler states as a positive fact that at the moment of the Incarnation (ofChrist) all the planets were in conjunction in the sign Pisces ... theconstellation of the Messiah.” (I. 717.)4. On the porticos of buildings sacred to votive offerings to the dead, in theBuddhist religion, are ornaments of a “cross formed of two fishes.” (III. 151.)5. “The sign of the Messiah’s coming is the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn inthe sign Pisces.” (III. 152.)TAURUS, THE BULL—THE SECOND SIGN OF THE ZODIACReferences in The Secret Doctrine1. “All the Sun-Gods ... have been mystically connected with the constellationTaurus and were called the First.” (I. 720.) [679]2. Taurus is regarded as the central group of the Milky Way.Note: The Pleiades as the central group of the Bull and Alcyone, one of the 7pleiades, is supposed to be the star around which our universe revolves.VIRGO, THE VIRGIN—THE SIXTH SIGN OF THE ZODIACReferences in The Secret Doctrine1. “One of the most esoteric cycles is based upon certain conjunctions andrespective positions of Virgo and the Pleiades.” (II. 454.)“Virgo is inseparable from Leo and the Pleiades and the Hyades.”VENUSIn the second solar system, and in connection with the method employed therein,another point merits attention. This fire of mind has its source in aconstellation until recently unrecognised by exoteric science as having anyrelation of an intimate nature to our solar system, owing to its tremendousdistance away. The sun “Sirius” is the source of logoic manas in the same senseas the Pleiades are connected with the evolution of manas in the seven HeavenlyMen, and Venus was responsible for the coming in of mind in the Earth chain.Each was primary to the other, or was the agent which produced the first flickerof consciousness in the particular groups involved. In every case the method wasthat of a slow evolutionary growth till the consciousness suddenly blazed forthowing to the interposition of force, apparently from an extraneous source. [680]1. “The Logos.—Solar System. Sirius.2. Seven Heavenly Men—Planetary scheme. Pleiades.3. Heavenly Man—earth chain. Venus.”(Cosmic Fire, page 347.)The Fourth Kingdom and the Hierarchy of the Planet“Certain facts have already been grasped and realised by the average occultstudent who has been pondering this teaching with care. He is aware that thejuncture of Spirit-matter and mind, or manas, was effected during the thirdroot-race, and that the definitely human family became present upon earth fromthat date. He knows that this was brought about by the coming, in bodilyPresence, of certain great Entities, and he has learned that these Entities camefrom the Venusian chain, that They achieved the necessary juncture, undertookthe government of the planet, founded the occult Hierarchy, and that—though someremain with the chain—the remainder have returned to Their originating source.This in many ways sums up the totality of the present knowledge. Let us brieflyenlarge upon it, correct certain erroneous interpretations, and ascertain one ortwo new facts. We might tabulate these as follows:First, it should be borne in mind by the occult student that:a. This advent signalised the taking of a physical vehicle by the planetaryLogos, and was literally the coming of the Avatar.b. This advent was brought about by a definite systemic alignment whichinvolved:The Venus scheme of the system.The Venus chain of the Earth scheme.The Venus globe of the Earth chain. [681]c. That the planetary Logos did not come from the Venus scheme but from theVenus chain of His own scheme, the Earth scheme. Owing to systemic alignmentlogoic kundalini could flow through a certain triangle of which two points wereVenus and the Earth. This caused an acceleration of vibration, and enabled theHeavenly Man of our scheme to take a minor initiation, and to set about Hispreparations for a major initiation.Next, it should also be remembered that in considering this matter we must becareful to view it not only as it affects our own globe and its presenthumanity, but from the systemic and cosmic point of view, or from the angle ofits importance to a planetary Logos and a solar Logos. Hence it is a fact thatthis event was not only the result of the taking of a minor initiation by ourEarth Logos, but in the Venus scheme was signalised by the taking of a majorinitiation by the Venusian planetary Logos on His fifth chain. In connectionwith a solar Logos it followed upon the stimulation of one of His centres andfrom the geometrical progression of the fire through the earlier mentionedTriangle.It has been stated that one hundred and four Kumaras came from Venus to theEarth; literally the figure was one hundred and five, when the synthesisingUnit, the Lord of the World Himself, is counted as one. There remain still withHim the three Buddhas of Activity. I would call attention to the dualsignificance of that name, “Buddha of Activity,” bearing out, as it does, thereality of the fact that Entities at Their stage of evolution are activelove-wisdom and embody in Themselves the two aspects. The three Buddhas ofActivity have a correspondence to the three persons of the Trinity.” (C.F.386-7.)[682] “The planetary Logos of this scheme is called ‘the First Kumara,’ the OneInitiator, and the statement is made that he came to this planet from Venus,Venus being ‘the Earth’s primary.’ This needs elucidation somewhat, though itmay not be permitted to do more than convey a few hints as to the truth. Thefact is one of the most mysterious in the development of our scheme, and in itlies hidden the secret of this world cycle. It is not easy to convey the truthand words but seem to veil and cloak.Perhaps a hint may be given in pointing out that there is an analogy between thecoming in of the Ego in full sway and its taking hold at certain periods in thelife of a human being. At seven years we are told the Ego “takes hold,” andagain at adolescence; at twenty-one that hold may be made still firmer. Again,as lives are passed, the Ego (in connection with a human being), grips itsvehicles and so sways them to his purpose with more effect and fullness. Thesame procedure can be seen in relation to a Heavenly Man and His body ofmanifestation, a scheme. It must be remembered that every scheme has sevenchains; that each chain has seven globes, making a totality of forty-nineglobes; that each globe is again in turn occupied by the life of the Logosduring what we call seven rounds, making literally three hundred and forty-threeincarnations, or fresh impulses to manifest. We must add to these majormanifestations such lesser ones as those named by us root-races, and sub-races,also branch races, and thus we are faced with a complexity that is enough tostagger the average student. The planetary wheel of life turns on its lesserscale the wheel of life of the little pilgrim we call man; as it turns, itsweeps the life of the evolving planetary Logos into ever new forms andexperiences until the fire of Spirit burns up all lesser fires.[683] As earlier pointed out, each Heavenly Man is linked with one of HisBrothers under the Law of Mutual Attraction, which manifests so degradingly asyet upon the physical plane, through the life of the human unit, imprisoned inphysical form. Psychically the link is of a different nature, and such a link isfound between the planetary Logos of the scheme we call Venus, and the Logos ofour scheme. This psychic interaction has its cyclic ebb and flow, as ebbs andflows all life force. In Lemurian days came a period of close interaction whichbrought about an incarnation on the physical planet of the Logos of our scheme,the Head of the Hierarchy, and the One Initiator. This could not have beeneffected had not the planetary Logos of the Venus scheme been in a position tolink up closely with ours.” (C.F. 366-7.)“The Cosmos . Our solar system, with the Pleiades and one of the stars of theGreat Bear, form a cosmic triangle, or an aggregation of three centres in theBody of Him of Whom naught may be said . The seven stars in the constellation ofthe Great Bear are the correspondences to the seven head centres in the body ofthat Being, greater than our Logos. Again, two other systems, when allied withthe solar system and the Pleiades, make a lower quaternary which are eventuallysynthesised into the seven head centres in much the same way as in the humanbeing after the fourth initiation.” (C.F. 182.)“A clue tending towards the correct understanding lies hid in the words: ‘Venusis the Earth’s primary.’It is not permissible to say much about this mystery, that ‘Venus is the Earth’salter ego,’ nor is it advisable, but certain ideas may be suggested which—ifbrooded on—may result in a wider grasp of the beauty of nature’s [684]synthesis, and of the wonderful correlation of all that is in process ofevolution.Perhaps some idea may be gained if we remember that, in an occult sense, Venusis to the Earth what the higher Self is to man.The coming of the Lords of Flame to the Earth was all under law and not just anaccidental and fortunate happening; it was a planetary matter which finds itscorrespondence in the connection between the mental unit and the manasicpermanent atom. Again, as the antahkarana is built by individual man betweenthese two points, so—again in a planetary sense—is a channel being built bycollective man on this planet to its primary, Venus.In connection with these two planets, it must be remembered that Venus is asacred planet and the Earth is not. This means that certain of the planets areto the Logos what the permanent atoms are to man. They embody principles.Certain planets afford only temporary homes to these principles. Others persistthroughout the mahamanvantara. Of these Venus is one.” (C.F. 298.)“It would be well to enlarge here a little on the connection between Venus andthe Earth, which is hinted at in some of the occult books, and is somewhattouched upon in this. I have stated that the interaction between the two schemesis due largely to their positive and negative polarity, and I pointed out that asimilar relation underlies the relation of the Pleiades and the seven schemes ofour solar system, and also the relation of Sirius and the system itself. This,therefore, sweeps into close interaction three great systems:1. The system of Sirius. [685]2. The system of the Pleiades.3. The system of which our sun is the focal point.making, as we will have noted, a cosmic triangle. Within our system there areseveral such triangles, varying at different stages; according to their relationto each other, the differentiated force of the different schemes can pass fromscheme to scheme, and thus the units of life on the different rays or streams offorce become temporarily intermingled. In all these triangles (cosmic, systemic,planetary, and human) two points of the triangle represent each a differentpolarity, and one point represents the point of equilibrium, or synthesis ormerging. This should be borne in mind in studying both the macrocosmic andmicrocosmic centres, for it accounts for diversity in manifestation, in formsand in quality.A correspondence might here also be pointed out which may serve to convey lightto those who have eyes to see:The Venus scheme, being in the fifth round, had the fifth principle of manascoordinated and developed, the minor four manasic aspects had been synthesised,and the buddhic aspect was being provided with a means of expression through themedium of the perfected fifth. Our Heavenly Man, in the fifth round, will haveattained a paralleling point in evolution, and the fifth principle will, asstated, be no longer the object of His attention as regards the human units.”(C.F. 375-6.)Just as Venus is negatively polarised to our Earth scheme, so the seven stars ofthe Pleiades are negatively polarised to our seven schemes.A very pertinent question might here be asked. We might justly enquire (inconnection with the point that Venus is negatively polarised, and also that thePleiades [686] are equally so) why they should be termed negative if they arethe donors and not the receivers, for to be negative is surely to be receptive.This is indeed so, but the question arises in our minds, owing to lack ofinformation, and consequent misapprehension. Venus may have had much to do withthe impartation of the stimulation which resulted in great events on Earth viathe Venus chain of our scheme, but our scheme gave, in a mysterious manner, morethan was received , though the gift was not of the same nature. The coming in ofthe Venusian influence to our chain, and to our planet, with the subsequentstimulation of certain groups in the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human,caused a paralleling event of even greater magnitude in the Venus scheme. Thisaffected the sixth Hierarchy, one of the deva Hierarchies, dwelling in the Venusscheme. This stimulation emanated via our sixth chain (or the second accordingto the angle of vision) and affected the corresponding chain in the Venusscheme. The magnitude of the difference may be seen in the fact that in our caseone globe alone was affected, whereas the influence of our scheme on theVenusian was such that an entire chain was stimulated. This was brought aboutthrough the positive polarity of the Heavenly Man of the Earth scheme.” (C.F.377-8.)“The statement that the great Kumara or the One Initiator came to this planetfrom Venus is true in so far as it embodies the fact that He came to this denseplanet (the fourth) in the fourth chain from that chain in our scheme which iscalled the ‘Venus’ chain, and which is the second chain. He came via the secondglobe in our chain; His scarcely felt vibration was sensed (occultly) in thesecond round, but only in the third root-race of the fourth round did conditionspermit of His physical incarnation and of [687] His coming as the Avatar. Veryreverently might it he said that the first three rounds and the two succeedingroot-races in this chain correspond to the period prior to birth; and that Hiscoming in the fourth round with the subsequent awakening of manas in the humanunits find their analogy in the awakening of the life principle in the unborninfant at the fourth month.” (C.F. 371.)SOME HINTS ON THE SCIENCE OF TRIANGLES“Two hints can here he given for thoughtful consideration. In connection withone of the Heavenly Men (which one cannot at this juncture be pointed out) wehave one triangle of force to be seen in the following three centres:a. The force centre of which the Manu, and His group, are the expression.b. The centre of which the Bodhisattva or the Christ and His adherents are thefocal point.c. The centre of which the Mahachohan and his followers are the exponents.These three groups form the three centres in one great triangle—a triangle whichis not yet in complete vivification at this stage of evolutionary development.Another triangle in connection with our own planetary Logos is that formed bythe seven Kumaras—the four exoteric Kumaras corresponding to the four minor headcentres, and the three esoteric Kumaras corresponding to the three major headcentres.The second hint I seek to give, lies in the triangle formed by the Earth, Marsand Mercury. In connection [688] with this triangle, the analogy lies in thefact that Mercury and the centre at the base of the spine in the human being areclosely allied. Mercury demonstrates kundalini in intelligent activity, whileMars demonstrates kundalini latent. The truth lies hid in their two astrologicalsymbols. In transmutation and planetary geometrising, the secret may berevealed.”“... Just as in connection with our planetary Logos, the three etheric planetsof our chain—Earth, Mercury and Mars—form a triangle of rare importance, so itmay be here said that at the present point in evolution of the logoic centres,Venus, Earth and Saturn form one triangle of great interest. It is a trianglethat is at this time undergoing vivification through the action of kundalini; itis consequently increasing the vibratory capacity of the centres, which arebecoming slowly fourth-dimensional. It is not yet permissible to point outothers of the great triangles....” (Cosmic Fire, p. 180-2.)“There is a definite occult reason, under the Laws of Electricity, behind theknown fact that every initiate, presented to the Initiator, is accompanied bytwo of the Masters, who stand one on either side of him. The three of themtogether form a triangle which makes the work possible.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 210.)“... In all these triangles (cosmic, systemic, planetary, and human) two pointsof the triangle represent each a different polarity, and one point representsthe point of equilibrium, of synthesis or merging.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 375.)[689] “Another fact that should be noted about these great Beings is, that whenviewed in Their seven groups, They form:a. Focal points for the force or influence emanating from the other solarcentres or schemes.b. The seven divisions of the occult Hierarchy.They exist, as does the Heavenly Man Himself, in etheric matter, and areliterally great Wheels, or centres of living Fire, manasic and electric fire;They vitalise the body of the Heavenly Man and hold all together as an objectivewhole. They make a planetary triangle within the chain, and each of Themvitalises one globe.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 388.)1. “Two connecting principles are needed. This requires a living spiritual Fireof the middle principle from the fifth and third states of Pleroma. This fire isthe possession of the Triangles.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 681.)“Second , just as in the case of man, certain triangles of force are found atdifferent stages of evolution, or (to word it otherwise) different centresbecome geometrically linked, such as the:a. Base of the spine, b. Solar plexus, c. Heart; or again, a. Solar Plexus, b.Heart, c. Throat;[690] so, in the case of a Heavenly Man, or of a solar Logos, a similar eventoccurs. Such an event transpired in this round in relation to the centre whichour planetary Logos embodies. It became geometrically linked with two othercentres, of which Venus was one, and logoic Kundalini—circulating withtremendous force through this adjusted Triangle—brought about thatintensification of vibration in the human family which resulted inindividualisation.” (Cosmic Fire, pp. 368-9.)“A hint may here be given to those who have power to see. Three constellationsare connected with the fifth logoic principle in its threefold manifestation;Sirius, two of the Pleiades, and a small constellation whose name must beascertained by the intuition of the student. These three govern theappropriation by the Logos of His dense body. When the last pralaya ended, andthe etheric body had been coordinated, a triangle in the Heavens was formedunder law which permitted a flow of force, producing vibration on the fifthsystemic plane. That triangle still persists, and is the cause of the continuedinflow of manasic force; it is connected with the spirillae in the logoic mentalunit and as long as His will-to-be persists, the energy will continue to flowthrough. In the fifth round, it will be felt at its height.” (Cosmic Fire, p.699.)“The heart of the Sun, and its relation to the lower and higher mental bodies,producing that peculiar manifestation we call the causal body. In thisconnection it must be remembered that the force which flows from the heart ofthe Sun, works through a triangle formed by the Venusian scheme, the Earth andthe Sun.[691] “That another triangle was also formed involving two planets was to beexpected under the law, and the triangles vary according to the schemeinvolved.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 664.)“We must recognise another triangle within the Earth scheme, of the chainscalled “the Earth chain,” the Venus chain, and the Mercurian chain, but thistriangle entirely concerns the centres of the planetary Logos of our scheme. Asystemic formation of great importance in the next round should be pointed outwhich will bring three schemes:The Earth Scheme,Mars,Mercury,into such a position in relation to each other that the following results willeventuate:A systemic triangle will be formed .” (Cosmic Fire, p. 390.)“Three of the sacred planets, it should be remembered, are the home of the threemajor Rays, the embodied forms of the three logoic aspects or principles. Otherplanets are embodiments of the four minor rays. We might consider—from thestandpoint of the present—that Venus, Jupiter and Saturn might be considered asthe vehicles of the three super-principles at this time. Mercury, the Earth andMars are closely allied to these three, but a hidden mystery lies here. Theevolution of the inner round has a close connection with this problem. Perhapssome light may be thrown upon the obscurity of the matter by the realisationthat just as the Logos has (in the non-sacred planets) the [692] correspondenceto the permanent atoms in the human being, so the middle evolution between thesetwo (God and man) is the Heavenly Man, whose body is made up of human and devamonads, and Who has likewise His permanent atoms. Always the three higherprinciples can be distinguished in importance from the four lower.” (CosmicFire, p. 299.)“Those who are working in the Uranus, the Neptune, and the Saturn scheme worksomewhat differently to those functioning in the Venus, the Vulcan, the Mars,the Mercury, the Jupiter, the Earth and the exoteric Saturn scheme, and so dothe Manasadevas of the inner round. We should note here that we again have atriplicity of groups, representing a triplicity of force, and herein lies ahint. In the central list of schemes the middle and lower group of Agnishvattasare active. In the others the higher group and middle group hold sway as theseplanets are the most occult and sacred in manifestation, and are concerned onlywith egos who are on the Path, and who are therefore group-active. In connectionwith Uranus, Neptune and Saturn, this might be expected as they are thesynthesising planetary schemes, and provide conditions suitable only for thevery advanced stages. They are the ‘reaping’ planets.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 777.)“The planets Venus and Jupiter are exceedingly closely connected with the Earth,and form eventually an esoteric triangle.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 370.)“Each of the planets—of which seven only were called sacred—whether known orunknown, is a septenary , as is also the chain to which the Earth belongs....”(S.D. I. 176.)[693] “The Dense Physical Planets:Earth 4th Chain 4th Globe Jupiter 3rd Chain 4th Globe Saturn 3rd Chain 4th GlobeMars 4th Chain 4th Globe Vulcan 3rd Chain 4th Globe Venus 5th Chain 5th GlobeMercury 4th Chain 5th Globe”(Cosmic Fire, p. 373.)PLANETS, RAYS AND ESOTERIC TEACHINGUranus (7th)—The School of Magic of the tenth order. It is sometimes called ‘theplanet of the violet force,’ and its graduates wield the power of cosmic ethericprana.Earth (3rd)—The School of Magnetic Response . Another name given to its pupilsis ‘The graduates of painful endeavour’ or the ‘adjudicators between the polaropposites.’ Its graduates are said to undergo examination upon the 3rd subplaneof the astral plane.Vulcan (1st)—The School of Fiery Stones. There is a curious connection betweenthe human units who pass through its halls and the mineral kingdom. The humanunits on the earth scheme are called ‘the living stones’; on the Vulcan they arecalled ‘fiery stones.’[694] Jupiter (2nd)—The School of Beneficent Magicians . This planet issometimes called in the parlance of the Schools, the ‘College of Quadruple ForceUnits,’ for its members wield four kinds of force in constructive magical work.Another name given to its halls is ‘The Palace of Opulence’ for its graduateswork with the law of Supply and are frequently called the ‘sowers.’Mercury (4th)—The pupils of this planetary school are called ‘The Sons ofAspiration’ or ‘The points of Yellow Light.’ They have a close connection withour Earth scheme. The name of this school is not given.Venus (5th)—The School with five strict Grades . This again is a planetaryscheme closely related to ours. Its planetary Logos is in a more advanced groupof cosmic students than is ours. Most of its hierarchical instructors come fromthe 5th cosmic plane.Mars (6th)—The School for Warriors , or the open grades for soldiers. Four ofthese planetary schools are responsible for the energy flowing through the ‘fourcastes’ in all parts of the world. Its teachers are spoken of as ‘Graduates ofthe Ruddy Flame’ and are frequently portrayed as clothed in red robes.... Theywork under the first logoic aspect and train those whose work is along the linesof the destroyer.[695] Neptune (6th)—This school concerns itself with the development of thedesire element and its graduates are called the ‘Sons of Vishnu.’ (Cosmic Fire.1177-1179.)The Schools on Saturn, the Sun, the Moon and on Pluto are not given but completethe twelve planets."},{"pageContent":"ARCANE SCHOOL TRAININGTraining for new age discipleship is providedby the Arcane School.
